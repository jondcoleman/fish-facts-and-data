1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,420
 So you don't want to go back to sleep?

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:20,040
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Things A Fish, a weekly podcast coming

3
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,280
 to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

4
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,000
 My name is Anna Toshinsky and I'm sitting here with James Arkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,740
 this week we are with Ed Brooke Hitching, our fellow QI Elf, who has just written a new book,

6
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:35,740
 right?

7
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:41,020
 Yes, it's called The Golden Atlas, a history of exploration, just filled with that kind

8
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,180
 of quirky QI style facts.

9
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:48,260
 Yes, it is a really beautiful looking book full of amazing looking kind of maps and little

10
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,240
 factoids about exploration.

11
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,080
 Get it now, go to Ed's Twitter feed or any book show after the show.

12
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,960
 After the show, sorry, get it in, you know, however long it takes to listen to this.

13
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,640
 It's available in any bookshop or online and for now, once again, we're gathered here

14
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,360
 with our four favourite facts from the last seven days in no particular order, here we go.

15
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,360
 Starting with you, Ed.

16
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:17,400
 So my fact is the most experienced sailor of all Captain Cook's First Voyage was a goat.

17
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,400
 But yes, she previously sailed around the world.

18
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,280
 When you say she was experienced, she didn't do any sailing, presumably, she was just on

19
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,280
 milk provision.

20
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,360
 I don't think she was too, like, nifty with the ropes, if that's what I mean.

21
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,760
 But yeah, she'd survived, like a global, like a circumnavigation, you know, I think she'd

22
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,600
 survived three shipwrecks as well.

23
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,600
 Wow.

24
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,600
 That's pretty amazing.

25
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,600
 All for her milk.

26
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,440
 So she was, yeah, a really impressive.

27
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,440
 What was she called?

28
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,840
 Oh, she didn't have a name, but she's known as the well-traveled goat.

29
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,880
 That is the first animal to travel around the world and in fact, wasn't she the first female

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,880
 to travel around the world?

31
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,880
 Yes, in the world.

32
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,880
 And they didn't even give her a name.

33
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,560
 They named her the well-traveled and then they got her species name at the end.

34
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,560
 That's wrong with that.

35
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,560
 Yeah.

36
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,760
 But they gave her some jewelry, like, when she returned, safe and sound, she went to live

37
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:09,600
 in Marlend and they gave her a silver collar, and she was quite a fancy goat.

38
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,640
 And then when she died, Dr. Johnson wrote her epitaph.

39
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,960
 Do you think they brought her on because she was so experienced as well as her milk stuff?

40
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,240
 Like, because you could get milk from any goat, but this is a goat that's been on two

41
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,240
 different experts.

42
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,600
 Yeah, she's probably there like a cigarette in her hand, like, no worries at all.

43
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,920
 But I guess, well, she could have been thought of as a lucky goat if she'd survived Chebrax.

44
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,920
 Yeah.

45
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,920
 Definitely.

46
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,920
 So that's something.

47
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,200
 Captain Cook actually once did chase a goat across an entire island.

48
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,200
 That's true.

49
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,200
 Was it a big island?

50
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,520
 I don't know.

51
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,080
 It was a stolen goat, though.

52
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,080
 That's it.

53
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,120
 So he, Captain Cook was making these voyages around the world, wasn't he?

54
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,280
 And the first one was scientific and the other two were discovering, you know, botanical

55
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,680
 things and lamb masses and that frequently things got next by the people he encountered,

56
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,520
 the aboriginals who he was meeting for the first time because there wasn't the same sense

57
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,080
 of property rights and ownership and things like that.

58
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,400
 And some things he said, no, we should just let it go.

59
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,720
 This doesn't matter.

60
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,720
 And then, but other times, when it was an important thing for the mission, he was really

61
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,240
 a stickler for getting it back.

62
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,920
 And we wanted the goat back because the third voyage, one of the missions was to introduce

63
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,680
 European livestock, so pairs of European livestock.

64
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,200
 So if you've lost one goat, it's very, very hard to get goat breeding.

65
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,520
 I can't remember if they didn't bring a spare, though, because you'd assume that a couple

66
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,520
 might go.

67
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,040
 I would have brought five or six, I think.

68
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,600
 Yeah, I mean, if we can just stock six ships worth of stuff, then that's fine.

69
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,920
 I think it was quite crowded for space on these ships, Anna.

70
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,920
 Fair enough.

71
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,400
 You would have been the worst on Noah's Ark.

72
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,920
 Why have you only got two of them?

73
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,960
 One of these didn't fancy each other.

74
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:48,240
 Well, a lot of room on the ship would have been taken up with Sour Crout.

75
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,880
 They brought several tons of Sour Crout, because Captain Cook was one of the first to realize

76
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:58,840
 that scurvy could be treated with vitamins, and he didn't quite understand why, but he

77
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,640
 had to convince no one like Sour Crout, so the way that he convinces Cruder to eat it was

78
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,040
 to serve his officers in a really fancy way, and so the crew would get jealous and think,

79
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,880
 "Oh, this must be something worth," stuff like that.

80
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,080
 Nouvelle Quizzine, Sour Crout.

81
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,080
 Yeah, exactly.

82
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:19,640
 That's a nice, white tablecloth, just a dumpload of Sour Crout.

83
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,640
 That's really clever.

84
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:25,600
 Did you know that one of his expeditions had his ostensible mission and then his secret mission?

85
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,600
 So this is his 1768 expedition, when he was officially going to Tahiti, he was supposed

86
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,320
 to observe the transit of Venus across the face of the sun and do a bunch of other scientific

87
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,320
 stuff.

88
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,040
 But the British government told him, "Do this, but here's a sealed envelope, and when

89
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,440
 you've done that, you're allowed to open this sealed envelope, and that contains a secret

90
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,440
 information for what you're actually supposed to do."

91
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,440
 It's like Taskmaster.

92
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:54,280
 It was such an extreme long episode of Taskmaster.

93
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,920
 And yeah, he opened the envelope when he'd done his Tahiti business, and it said, "Please

94
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,480
 find the great Southern continent."

95
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,480
 Everyone was convinced there was a big continent down in the South Pole, and they were right.

96
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,280
 Obviously, but he tried to find it and failed.

97
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:11,840
 They knew something was there and it was all based on, sort of, like, sightings of little islands,

98
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,840
 maybe ice flows.

99
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,840
 Yeah.

100
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,520
 But yeah, on the second voyage, they passed a cook and his men passed within 70 miles of

101
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,880
 Antarctica and didn't find it.

102
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,880
 Wow.

103
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,880
 That's so frustrating.

104
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,880
 How do we know?

105
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,920
 Do they leave footprint in the sea?

106
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,920
 What of where they went?

107
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,920
 Yeah.

108
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,920
 No, they have maps.

109
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,920
 Oh, yeah.

110
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,920
 They were riding it all down.

111
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:41,120
 It's full of maps.

112
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,160
 I've been reading about the ship itself, the Endeavour.

113
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,840
 This is a very famous ship, but it was such an unglamorous ship.

114
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,200
 So it was a coal-carrying ship, which is not, you know, very glam.

115
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,200
 It wasn't very fast.

116
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,640
 It could only go about six or seven knots at nautical miles an hour.

117
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:03,280
 But nonetheless, it was incredibly hardy because it was designed to carry coal around and

118
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,040
 it was built to last.

119
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,400
 So it did all these voyages.

120
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,960
 It hit the Great Barrier Reef once.

121
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,280
 He just bumped into the Great Barrier Reef, and it tore a hole in the side of the ship and

122
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,320
 they had to dump six cannon overboard immediately.

123
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,320
 So it wouldn't sink.

124
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,960
 Probably damaged the coral as well.

125
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,960
 Oh, yeah.

126
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,960
 But who cares?

127
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,360
 I mean, like I was just thinking that's effectively a footprint of the sea, isn't it?

128
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,360
 Yes.

129
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,360
 That's how we know.

130
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,280
 So I didn't mean that about who cares its coral.

131
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,800
 I care a lot about the Great Barrier Reef.

132
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,800
 Sorry.

133
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,800
 I get it.

134
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,080
 But scientists spent 200 years trying to find the cannon that he ditched overboard.

135
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,880
 And they knew that he'd been around there because they left charts and maps saying where

136
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,880
 they'd been.

137
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:45,080
 But no one could actually find the exact cannon until 1969 when they went there with a magnetometer

138
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,400
 looking for the iron of the cannons, testing for magnetism as a barrier reef, yeah.

139
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,400
 Very clever.

140
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,320
 Well, because we also recently found quite recently found the Endeavour itself, didn't

141
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,320
 we?

142
00:06:55,320 --> 00:07:01,660
 So the Endeavour was actually two ships in a way, because he used it, 17, you know, 17,

143
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,040
 17, 16, 17, 17, 17, he used it.

144
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,240
 And then it was renamed and repurposed.

145
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,440
 It became the Lord's Sandwich.

146
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:13,920
 And it took place in the Battle of Brooklyn, 1776, so one of the largest ships used there.

147
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,680
 And we only found out in the 1990s that that was the same ship.

148
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,880
 So I find that really weird that ships are fully repurposed.

149
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,840
 But it was called the Lord's Sandwich, Captain Cook was killed on the Sandwich Islands.

150
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,320
 It all comes full circle.

151
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,560
 Like the world he travelled around.

152
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,560
 Of course.

153
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,720
 Yeah, he was, what happened to him?

154
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,720
 He was baked.

155
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,720
 Was he?

156
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,720
 Well, part of the big parcel some more?

157
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,720
 There's a big popular method.

158
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,720
 He was eaten, wasn't there?

159
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,720
 Yeah, he wasn't eaten.

160
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,520
 He was just baked, so his bones could be removed and treated respectfully.

161
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,520
 Okay.

162
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,520
 He's a big honour to be baked.

163
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,400
 I don't think I'd like to watch the Sandwich Islands version of the Great Sandwich

164
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,400
 Island Bake-Off.

165
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:56,560
 But yeah, he was chopped up into little bits as well, wasn't he?

166
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:02,800
 So this is when he arrived on Hawaii with his crew and they thought he was a god for a

167
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,800
 while.

168
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,160
 They thought the whole crew were gods because they weren't in the middle of their big festival

169
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,080
 at the time, worshipping gods.

170
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,840
 And then one of their crew died, which really screwed things up for them because they thought

171
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,960
 they were immortal and then it turned out they weren't immortal.

172
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,680
 And so relationships went a bit sour.

173
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,780
 And then he sailed away and then rough seas swept him back and they got into fights and

174
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,080
 they ended up killing him.

175
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,720
 But the Hawaiians came and delivered all his bones in a sack, didn't they?

176
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,520
 I think one of his compatriots said.

177
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,520
 There's another weird link.

178
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:37,840
 You said that Dr. Johnson wrote the epitaph for the goat, the well-travel goat.

179
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,920
 So this was after one of Captain Cook's missions.

180
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,320
 He brought back a kangaroo.

181
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,640
 They discovered so much new stuff.

182
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:50,340
 They brought back 30,000 botanical species, 250 new fish and five mammals, including a kangaroo.

183
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:56,440
 And this is a story of a dinner in 1773 where Dr. Johnson was so excited that Captain Cook

184
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,920
 had discovered a kangaroo that he did an impression of it for all the other guests, despite the

185
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,920
 lack.

186
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,920
 He'd never seen one.

187
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,740
 Okay, so here's the account.

188
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,320
 He stood erect, put out his hands like feelers.

189
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,320
 This is Dr. Johnson.

190
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,560
 He put out his hands like feelers and gathering up the tails of his huge brown coat so as to

191
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,360
 resemble the pouch of the animal, made two or three vigorous bounds across the room.

192
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,360
 What?

193
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,400
 I mean, considering he's never seen one before, that does sound like a kangaroo.

194
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,400
 Yeah.

195
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,400
 It's perfect.

196
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,640
 I would have been fooled.

197
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,320
 Why do we keep calling him Captain Cook when he wasn't a captain?

198
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,320
 Ooh.

199
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,000
 Why do we call him Captain Cook when he wasn't a captain?

200
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 No.

201
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 He wasn't a cook either.

202
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 No, man.

203
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 He's a fraud.

204
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,680
 My assumed tea was a naval captain.

205
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:43,680
 He was a lieutenant when he was on Endeavour and then when he came back to England, he was

206
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,040
 given the rank of commander.

207
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:52,440
 And then by 1775, he became a post-captain, which was even better than a captain, but he was

208
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,920
 never actually a captain.

209
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,920
 That's so funny.

210
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,920
 Yeah.

211
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,720
 So he'd just leapfrog's captain, see?

212
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,720
 Yeah.

213
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,240
 He didn't even need to be a captain, but we still call him Captain Cook.

214
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,240
 It listarates, doesn't it?

215
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,240
 That's the thing.

216
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,240
 You're right.

217
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,240
 Good to be in Corporal Cook.

218
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,240
 Commander Cook.

219
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,240
 He was a commander.

220
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,240
 Yeah.

221
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,600
 So someone who's a captain of two ships, more than one ship?

222
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,600
 I think you are.

223
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,080
 If you're a captain of one ship, but you also have another ship under your command, you're

224
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,080
 then a commander.

225
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,000
 So it's kind of natural to call someone captain, even though they're a commander.

226
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 I think so.

227
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 I think if someone said where's the captain, they'd say, "Oh, we don't have a captain."

228
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 Yeah.

229
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,680
 Unfortunately, I've come on a misconception.

230
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,040
 It's kind of a naval emergency.

231
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,920
 Pets on naval pets?

232
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,040
 So naval pets were a big deal.

233
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,600
 So much so that there was a sailor zoo in the 19th century.

234
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,400
 It was set up in Portsmouth in 1893.

235
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:47,720
 And by 1935, they had lions and various marsupials and birds in aviaries, and with a couple

236
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,920
 of people all taking pets.

237
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,840
 So you mean that sailors had pet lions on their boats?

238
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:57,840
 Well, it seems like it expanded this naval zoo to incorporate things that possibly hadn't

239
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,840
 accompanied the sailors.

240
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,520
 But how did they get there, James?

241
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,520
 How did they...

242
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,680
 Yeah, they couldn't fly in those days.

243
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,480
 There was no Euro Tunnel.

244
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:10,040
 They did find a polar bear, some British sailors, and they just took it onto their ship.

245
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,760
 And they took it to Wayland.

246
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,760
 Yeah.

247
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,760
 They rescued it.

248
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,760
 It was a cub when they rescued it.

249
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,480
 And it was on some ice off Greenland, and they made it the ship's mascot and called it

250
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,480
 Barbara.

251
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,040
 Do you think she's an apparently funny name for a polar bear?

252
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:31,440
 All right, there's time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

253
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:38,600
 My fact this week is that for 150 years, Shakespeare's play The Tragedy of King Lear had a happy

254
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,600
 ending.

255
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,360
 Did they still call it The Tragedy of?

256
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,360
 No, they didn't.

257
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,280
 They slightly tweet the title, because they thought it might not work.

258
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:49,520
 So I read this in the conversation, and I can't believe I didn't know it, but basically

259
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,880
 people didn't like the fact that King Lear had a sad ending, which spoiler alert it does.

260
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,480
 I mean, really, really sad ending, it's The Tragedy.

261
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:03,560
 So it was sort of adapted by this writer called Neham Tate in 1681, and he rewrote it, and

262
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:08,560
 he called it the historical play of King Lear and his three daughters to remove the awkward

263
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,760
 word tragedy.

264
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,600
 And yeah, at the end, Cordelia saves King Lear.

265
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,360
 He puts her on the throne.

266
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,080
 There's a little love affair between her and remember Edgar and King Lear, who's kind

267
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,400
 of another nice guy.

268
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:23,440
 I don't think there's any flirting with Cordelia and Edgar in the original.

269
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,840
 And yeah, everyone lives happily ever after.

270
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:30,880
 So in the original, Lear dies, Cordelia dies, everyone dies.

271
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,880
 Everyone dies.

272
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,160
 Almost everyone has a tiny closing experience.

273
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,880
 We all die, Andy.

274
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,880
 Yeah, this is all right.

275
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,840
 It's a very concertina, then there is a death, that way.

276
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:43,680
 It's a classic Shakespeare tragedy, isn't it, where within the space is about five minutes,

277
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,800
 about 12 people dropped dead one after death.

278
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,040
 It's a very high body count.

279
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,280
 Do you think he just gets to the end?

280
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,440
 And he's like, oh, I've only got 100 words left.

281
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,440
 I'm just going to have to kill everyone.

282
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,800
 He's not doing an essay, James, I don't think he had a word count.

283
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,360
 I've gone way over.

284
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,360
 This is the way I think.

285
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,920
 The original that Shakespeare borrowed from was not a tragedy.

286
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,240
 I mean, it didn't have this incredibly tragic ending where everyone dies.

287
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,880
 So the rewritten version that you're talking about, and it was kind of a return to the

288
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,880
 previous edition, there was an ancient version called, there's a thing called Holland Shed's

289
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,560
 Chronicles, which has a lot of stories of kings and Shakespeare got a lot of plots

290
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,560
 from that.

291
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:24,480
 But King Lear, Shakespeare's version was in 1606, and it drew heavily on a play from

292
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,680
 1594.

293
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,680
 That's crazy, isn't it?

294
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,680
 The play was for the true Chronicle history of the life and death of King Lear and his

295
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,680
 three daughters.

296
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,080
 But that guy's still going to be alive, probably.

297
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,080
 He's still alive.

298
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,080
 He's still alive.

299
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,080
 I mean, that is, like, remaking die hard.

300
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,400
 That was about 30 years ago.

301
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,920
 This is about half the time from die hard till now.

302
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,280
 Yeah, but die hard too was much closer than that.

303
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,240
 Yeah, but it wasn't a remake by people.

304
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,240
 I don't think he did.

305
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,920
 Did the die hard makers sue the makers of die hard too?

306
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,920
 I was stealing the hide.

307
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:55,320
 Actually, what about Mary Poppins, they were about to redo that, aren't they?

308
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,320
 Or maybe they just have?

309
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,320
 That's true.

310
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,320
 That's controversial.

311
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,320
 And that was about 50 years ago, wasn't it?

312
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,320
 Yeah.

313
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,320
 So people are saying that's too soon.

314
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,120
 So maybe this is why he had to kill off all the characters, so that it wasn't too close

315
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,320
 to the original that he could be sued.

316
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,320
 Maybe.

317
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:12,640
 Do you think you can do that, just take any of the show, any other movie and make it exactly

318
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,120
 the same, but at the end just kill off all the characters?

319
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,120
 Yeah.

320
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,120
 What's the good film from early 2000s?

321
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,880
 I think we should just rewrite all 10 series of friends.

322
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,880
 Last episode.

323
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,880
 Everyone dies.

324
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,880
 Everyone dies.

325
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,880
 Do you know the reason why Nahem Tate changed the ending?

326
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,880
 They were all little sunflowers.

327
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,880
 No, what is it?

328
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,880
 What's it called?

329
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,880
 Snowflakes.

330
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,880
 Snowflakes.

331
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,080
 That's what we are in the summer with Snowflakes in the winter.

332
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,080
 Exactly.

333
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,080
 Snowflakes.

334
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,080
 Snowflakes.

335
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,080
 Snowflakes.

336
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,560
 Snowflakes, aren't they?

337
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:49,080
 Kind of, but I think it's because the players about the king being usurped.

338
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:54,080
 And when Nahem Tate was writing it was the 1680s, which is Charles II is on the throne.

339
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,840
 He's a bit sore about his father being executed and usurped.

340
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:02,200
 So Restoration Theatre was quite careful with various themes like that.

341
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,200
 Wow.

342
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,240
 And didn't they stop doing King Lear in George III's time?

343
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,240
 Oh, really?

344
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,560
 Because he was mentally ill, let's put it that way.

345
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,600
 But he read King Lear and had a bout of mental illness after having read King Lear.

346
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,600
 Really?

347
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,680
 And they put him in a straight jacket and tied him down and he was described as agitated

348
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,840
 and confused and he ended up in bed for weeks afterwards, because he'd read King Lear.

349
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,000
 And I don't know how the thought that it was to do with him.

350
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 Wow.

351
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 Maybe it's a dangerous book.

352
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,760
 Samuel Johnson didn't like it, even though he published one of those several times.

353
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,760
 No, Kangaroos in it.

354
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,760
 No, no Kangaroos.

355
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:43,000
 No, I didn't do an impression of the Mad King as well.

356
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,240
 And no, he read the whole thing with only Kangaroos' character.

357
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,880
 I genuinely have a fact about that.

358
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,400
 Oh, my God.

359
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:56,480
 In 2014, there was an English playwright who staged a version of King Lear called King Lear

360
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:02,120
 with sheep, which features one human character and then about nine sheep.

361
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,680
 And he's trying to direct a King Lear.

362
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,920
 The character in the play is trying to direct King Lear with sheep.

363
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,600
 And they disobey him.

364
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,560
 And he goes mad and starts acting out the narrative himself.

365
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:15,120
 And she said, "I wanted to use the idea of non-cooperative actors to explore the themes

366
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,960
 of King Lear, because there's a big scene where Cordelia doesn't do anything when she's

367
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,960
 told to."

368
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,600
 And she also said, "It's cheaper than paying actual actors."

369
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:29,800
 Okay, I've got a fact about that, which is kind of linked, which is that Neham Tate,

370
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:36,080
 as well as doing this play, he also wrote the song, "While Shepherds watch their flocks."

371
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,080
 Wow.

372
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,840
 Which is the earliest English Carol written that we're still singing the original words

373
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,520
 of.

374
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,880
 And he would have loved this new relation.

375
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:50,400
 I should just say to finish off the Samuel Johnson thing, for those sheep redirected us,

376
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,440
 he said that King Lear really troubled him, so it caused him extreme discomfort.

377
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,720
 And even though he published his edition in 1765, he found the death of Cordelia so upsetting

378
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,240
 that he never ever read it again.

379
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,240
 He refused to read it again.

380
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,240
 And that his editor was literally like, "You have to look at these pages to work out

381
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,240
 what we're going to cut."

382
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,040
 Because he said it was so traumatic.

383
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,040
 Wow.

384
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:12,720
 Really, Victorians found Shakespeare very horrible.

385
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,720
 We wrote a lot of them.

386
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,880
 I mean, would it make me think of you talking about like sensitivity to kings being overthrown?

387
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,120
 Do you know the movie "Doctor Strange Love?"

388
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,120
 I know it hadn't.

389
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,800
 They filmed an alternate ending, so it ends with a big sort of dog strain of getting out

390
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:31,760
 of his wheelchair and miraculously walking, and then the world blows up.

391
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:37,760
 But there was a filmed custard pie fight in the war, and there are photos of it.

392
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,960
 You can Google it, and you can see Peter says everyone throwing cream pies at each other.

393
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,960
 That's amazing.

394
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,960
 Yeah, that sounds great.

395
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,720
 And he effectively went with the Shakespeare ending, didn't he?

396
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,720
 Were everyone dice?

397
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,720
 Yeah.

398
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,720
 Oh, yeah.

399
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,720
 Really?

400
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,720
 Yeah.

401
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,720
 I did a little work on "Mayhem Tate."

402
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,720
 Oh, yeah.

403
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,720
 You know, his father was called "Faithful Teet."

404
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,720
 Wow.

405
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,720
 Wow.

406
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:02,720
 I mean, that's a strong name, isn't it?

407
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,720
 Yeah.

408
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,720
 Faithful Teet.

409
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,520
 That's also the name of one of the goats that went around the world.

410
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,520
 Yeah.

411
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,040
 And then I guess he changed his name.

412
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,040
 He didn't want to be called "Teet" anymore, so "Mayhem Tate Master" changed it.

413
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,040
 But he was a big deal.

414
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,040
 He was poet laureate.

415
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,040
 Was it?

416
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,040
 No, I mean, "Teet" was, as well, I think.

417
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,040
 Oh, sorry.

418
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,040
 That's what I mean, "Mayhem Tate" was.

419
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,040
 Yeah.

420
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,040
 "Washepers Watched Their Flogs By Night."

421
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:27,520
 For the next century, it was the only carol that was allowed in Church of England,

422
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,520
 ceremonies or services.

423
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,520
 Really?

424
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,520
 They hated carols.

425
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,760
 But this was just religious enough to kind of pass master.

426
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,160
 But at Christmas, would you do the thing where you sing eight carols, but you just had

427
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,160
 to sing "Washepers Watched Their Flogs By Night."

428
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,160
 Eight times.

429
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,680
 Yeah, like a carol service will be just the same thing all the time.

430
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:48,160
 And if you'll now turn your pages to carol number five, "Washepers Watched."

431
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,320
 And the only change that's been made over the last 300 years, according to Wikipedia,

432
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,320
 this is.

433
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:58,600
 And the only change that's been made has been changing the word from wilds to wild, so

434
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,080
 from wilds to shepherds.

435
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,680
 And the other changes where they changed it to "Washepers Watched Their Socks."

436
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,680
 That was the other one of cars, but.

437
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,800
 That was the original.

438
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,560
 Tite de San Dronecus was also changed.

439
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:18,680
 In Tite de San Dronecus in 1850, there's this big rape scene where a woman has a tongue

440
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:22,600
 cut out and her hands cut off and it's to prevent her spilling the names of her attackers.

441
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,840
 And that was all completely edited.

442
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:29,040
 There was a version of Hamla where a failure dies from accidental drowning, because it was

443
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,800
 thought to be too upsetting that it was suicide.

444
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:37,240
 But I think people are often saying that we're a bit too pathetic now, but too snowflakey.

445
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:43,080
 It was Baudler who did the accidental drowning, wasn't it, from whom we get Baudler right?

446
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:47,240
 It's a really cool fan theory about him, it's just a theory, actually, I don't know why you say it.

447
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,240
 About Baudler?

448
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,600
 Yeah, so he published this thing called "The Family Shakespeare," because he was saying

449
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,520
 that all families can read together.

450
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,680
 So if you're reading out to your children, you don't want to read a rape scene where

451
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:03,200
 some of us get the tongue cut out and hands cut off, which is kind of reasonable.

452
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,160
 So there's also lots of naughty stuff, you know, there are characters who are prostitutes

453
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,920
 and all that had to go.

454
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:12,880
 But there's a theory that it wasn't the Reverend Thomas Baudler who did most of the cutting,

455
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,640
 it was his sister.

456
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,760
 She did most of the cutting and she produced the first version.

457
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:22,560
 But Baudler claimed to have written it so that his sister didn't have to publicly admit

458
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,800
 that she had understood the root bits.

459
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,480
 That's so funny, maybe.

460
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,480
 Wow.

461
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:35,320
 When he was 40, just over 40, Baudler married a lady called Elizabeth Frevenon and it was

462
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:39,960
 such a bad marriage that they split up quite quickly and nobody in the family was ever

463
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,840
 allowed to mention Elizabeth's name ever again.

464
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,400
 So his whole life was Baudlerized basically.

465
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,400
 Wow.

466
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,400
 That's awesome.

467
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,400
 That's great.

468
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,440
 God, he was very free and easy with editing.

469
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,440
 Basically, isn't he?

470
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,160
 The editing is live out of the life.

471
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:59,440
 Queen Victoria said she'd never had the courage to see the Mary Wives of Windsor.

472
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,040
 She wrote to her daughter who was a Shakespeare fan.

473
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,520
 She never had the courage to see it because she'd always been told how very cool it was.

474
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,280
 And it's very boring.

475
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,480
 I've never read or seen that one.

476
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,480
 There's a thing.

477
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,840
 People say that he wrote it in nine days and I'll be honest, I'm staggered.

478
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,280
 It took him that long to write that way.

479
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,640
 Isn't the least good I've ever read.

480
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,720
 Maybe she just thought it was really dull but didn't want to upset Shakespeare fans.

481
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,320
 I said I've heard it's too rude.

482
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,440
 Yeah, she didn't she found him but too close for her taste generally.

483
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,320
 There have been 24 opera's based on Romeo and Juliet.

484
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:38,080
 The earliest is called Romeo and Juliet, which is quite cool and that has a happy ending.

485
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:43,800
 And also if you go on fanfic.com and look for some fanfiction on Romeo and Juliet, there

486
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,680
 is a thing called Romeo and Juliet happy ending.

487
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:52,760
 And at the end it's just it's like a final scene of Romeo and Juliet and it says days become

488
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:57,420
 days and years become years and one day Freya Lawrence gets a letter saying that Juliet had

489
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:01,960
 died in a sleep and later that year he gets the same letter from the Montague's that Romeo

490
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,960
 has died in his sleep.

491
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,960
 That's a nice ending isn't it?

492
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,160
 But he's substantially older than both of those characters isn't it?

493
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,920
 So they've still died quite young.

494
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,920
 Yeah.

495
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:17,640
 I just got one more thing about modern day, about modern day kind of censorship.

496
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,640
 And prudishness.

497
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,800
 So did you see the Cambridge University put trigger warnings on lots of it Shakespeare lectures?

498
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,080
 And people got really exercised about this.

499
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,080
 Really?

500
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,080
 Yeah.

501
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,080
 Just for like some flowers who couldn't really do.

502
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,080
 Some flowers.

503
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,080
 Yeah.

504
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,120
 So I think this is why this conversation article came out.

505
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:38,440
 It was saying don't worry people have always done this, but if you take English literature

506
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:43,400
 at Cambridge, then if you go to a lecture for instance on Titus Andronicus or in fact

507
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,480
 on Euripides the Back Eye, that's another one that has them, then you get a little one

508
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:51,880
 of those exclamation marks in a red triangle at the end of the lecture, which is to say this

509
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,480
 might contain some traumatic themes.

510
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,480
 Oh my god.

511
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,480
 Yeah.

512
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:00,480
 If you have been troubled by any of the themes in Titus Andronicus.

513
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,960
 You've had a rough old life actually.

514
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,960
 Yeah.

515
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,960
 That is tough.

516
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,800
 If your sons have been baked in a pie.

517
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:15,680
 Okay, let's move on to fact number three.

518
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,600
 That is Andy's fact.

519
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,760
 My fact is that some advertisers have started putting single pixels on mobile phones ads

520
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:26,040
 so you think it's dust, try to wipe it off and accidentally click on the advert.

521
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,040
 It is.

522
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,040
 It's genius.

523
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,040
 That is so good.

524
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,040
 Yeah.

525
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,920
 So I've only found one advertiser that's done this.

526
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,120
 There's a great article on Medium called 52 Things I Learned This Yeah, and this is one

527
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,720
 of the 52 things.

528
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,000
 But it doesn't really work, right?

529
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,800
 I read another article I think it was.

530
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:45,320
 I'm not sure where I read this, but basically they said if you get paid for every time someone

531
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:50,360
 taps on it, then it works, but if you're trying to get actual sales, then it pisses people

532
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,280
 off so much that people end up not buying stuff.

533
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:58,680
 I guess they must be thinking the product is so good that someone will end up buying it.

534
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,680
 And what was the product?

535
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,560
 Oh, I can't remember, I'm afraid.

536
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,360
 I do know another one who's done a really similar thing.

537
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:09,320
 There's a Chinese trainer manufacturer and they've put a thing that looks like a hair across

538
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:14,000
 their advert and you swipe to get rid of the hair and you go straight to their website.

539
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 Yeah.

540
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 I got banned from Instagram, didn't I?

541
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,520
 Apparently, it violated Instagram's policies and was removed and they Instagram shut down

542
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,840
 the entire brand's account.

543
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,840
 Wow.

544
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,840
 Because of that.

545
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,840
 Yeah.

546
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,240
 I can't believe it's not counterproductive.

547
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,320
 I like you say.

548
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,320
 It's just so irritating.

549
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:36,000
 There was a study a few years ago that found that 50% of ad clicks on phones are accidental.

550
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 I'm surprised.

551
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 I'm surprised.

552
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 I'm surprised it's not low.

553
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,560
 I don't think I've ever intentionally clicked on one.

554
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:46,180
 What phone is so smashed up that if there was something that looks a bit like a hair, you

555
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,180
 would never see it.

556
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,180
 No, absolutely not.

557
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,280
 This bit would not work on me at all.

558
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,920
 The thing it reminded me of is, and I was desperately looking for like a source for it,

559
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,080
 but it's something my American grandmother told me and I've heard it mentioned on an American

560
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:01,200
 podcast as well that in the old days when you were making a telephone call and you call

561
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,420
 into the exchange, you could choose which company would carry your call, so which one

562
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,680
 would get your money, right?

563
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,680
 Really?

564
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,680
 Wow.

565
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:13,040
 The most common answer was, you know, I don't care whatever, whichever one you choose.

566
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:18,040
 And so people started phone companies called, I don't care, it doesn't matter whatever you

567
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,040
 want.

568
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,040
 And they'd rake in this sort of extreme.

569
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,040
 Incredible.

570
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,040
 Yeah, it's genius.

571
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:27,720
 Do you know on the internet, if you click on a naughty site, you might get a whole load

572
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,720
 of pop-ups, right?

573
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,720
 All right.

574
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,720
 Lots of pop-up things.

575
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,720
 Oh, you do know that.

576
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,720
 The one.

577
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,720
 I'm afraid about it.

578
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,720
 If people with pornographers digest it, yeah.

579
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:40,520
 They're called "Pornados" or "PonStombs".

580
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:46,480
 This is a phrase coined by John C. Dvořák, who is the nephew of the guy who invented the

581
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:51,920
 Dvořák Keyboard, which is like a Quarty Keyboard, but it's supposed to be slightly better

582
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,920
 than the Quarty Keyboard.

583
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:57,120
 That's a step down, isn't it, in far the sun, invention in terms?

584
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,120
 Yeah.

585
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:05,040
 Well, Dvořák, he writes a lot about computers and he said that the recent Apple's Macintosh

586
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:09,800
 computer would not be successful is because it uses a pointing device called a mouse.

587
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,320
 And there is no evidence that people want to use these things.

588
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,080
 And then he wrote about Steve Jobs.

589
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:20,320
 Maybe when the smoke clears, we will have heard the last of Steve Jobs as guru, CEO, visionary.

590
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:25,680
 He'll go the way of the pet rock, electric carving knives, silly putty, tiny Tim and the

591
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,280
 three-tone paint job.

592
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,720
 That's not really rough on tiny Tim.

593
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,720
 Yeah.

594
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:36,320
 A load of African products and then one of the most heart-rending characters on a literature.

595
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,320
 So big.

596
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,360
 Squashed up next to silly putty.

597
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:44,040
 I can only imagine maybe tiny Tim as something else in America, right?

598
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,040
 I guess so.

599
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,880
 Probably like a failed product or something.

600
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:52,120
 But like, you know, it'll go the way of C. Monkeys, nasal hair trimmers and Jude the Obscure.

601
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,960
 That's a weird spoon.

602
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:00,520
 Do you know why pop-up ads were originally conceived?

603
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,520
 No.

604
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,880
 It was because advertisers didn't want to be associated with dodgy website content.

605
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,960
 So it's kind of the opposite of problems that websites have now, where sometimes dodgy

606
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,920
 adverts pop-up on them.

607
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:15,400
 So they were invented by a guy called Mr. Zuckerman in the 1990s.

608
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:19,960
 And it was because a car company got upset because it bought a banner advert on a page that

609
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:26,560
 happened to be about anal sex, which they thought wasn't on brand for their car company.

610
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,960
 It's unlikely to be on brand for any car company.

611
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,960
 Not exactly.

612
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,600
 There's so little overlap there.

613
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,480
 And so he made pop-up ads to kind of distinguish them from each other.

614
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,960
 And he says that he was wrong with sales.

615
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,800
 It's just a kind of sex.

616
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,800
 I know.

617
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:47,400
 It's the way you say a page that happened to be about it.

618
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,400
 By chance, it was an anal sex theme page.

619
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,400
 They exist.

620
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,400
 I suppose so.

621
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,400
 They're out there.

622
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,400
 Hang on.

623
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,600
 The car adverts were popping up on this themed page.

624
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,600
 Yeah.

625
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,440
 It was all sorts of things popping up.

626
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,240
 They weren't up for it.

627
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:06,480
 So he designed this pop-up thing, which is supposed to say, look, this pop-up has nothing

628
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,360
 to do with the content of this web page.

629
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,200
 But he's really apologised for it now.

630
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,560
 He says he feels terribly guilty, because he knows that pop-ups are the most annoying thing

631
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,560
 on the internet.

632
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,000
 But his intentions were good.

633
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,920
 He didn't want cars to be associated with sexual positions.

634
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:23,880
 So other stupid creative ways of advertising?

635
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,840
 Domino's this year, advertised in potholes.

636
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:31,120
 So this is the thing where they've now got a sideline in fixing potholes on roads across

637
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,120
 America.

638
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:35,880
 And you can actually request that they come and fix your pothole if you're in America.

639
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,760
 And I think it's an advertising campaign.

640
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,320
 Otherwise, they're just really good guys.

641
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,560
 But it's called paving for pizza.

642
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:47,320
 And they partner with various local administrations and say, hey, have you got any potholes that need

643
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,320
 doing?

644
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,640
 And they send out their pizza delivery guys who do a sideline in kind of tarmac filling.

645
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,800
 And then they fill in the potholes.

646
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,400
 And then they fill in the pothole with little Domino's pizza logo.

647
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,400
 I'm sorry.

648
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,920
 It's not very long lasting at all.

649
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,920
 Wow.

650
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,920
 That's quite good, isn't it?

651
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,920
 Yeah.

652
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,920
 That's a good idea.

653
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,920
 So they get their logo on the road.

654
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,520
 But everyone gets flat roads.

655
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,520
 So everyone's a winner.

656
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,520
 Wow.

657
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,360
 Apart from the other pizza manufacturers.

658
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,360
 Yeah.

659
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,120
 Papa John is furious.

660
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,880
 The justification was that potholes damaged pizzas.

661
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,720
 So they're actually saving the pizzas because on the way, they'll get bumped up and down.

662
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,840
 They actually put a GoPro inside a pizza box.

663
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:30,360
 And how people watch the traumatic journey they have to go through to make it to their destination.

664
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,360
 Wow.

665
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,360
 Yeah.

666
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,240
 OKFC advertises on fire hydrants.

667
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,240
 They do this.

668
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:41,040
 I think a couple of years ago, they'll pay people to let them fix their fire hydrants if they're

669
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,040
 broken.

670
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,040
 They do this in Indianapolis.

671
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:46,120
 So they paid, I think, $5,000 to say, can we fix your fire hydrant?

672
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,200
 And the town was like, yeah, great.

673
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,680
 And then they sort of put some KFC advertising on top of it.

674
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:54,040
 But they do also fill up the fire hydrant with chicken.

675
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:58,120
 But then all the fire smelled delicious.

676
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:04,520
 You don't mind burning to a crisp with a delicious smell of KFC all around you.

677
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:11,520
 OK, onto our final fact of the week.

678
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,000
 And that is James' Facts.

679
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,960
 OK, my fact this week is that one of the most popular celebrities in London in 1860,

680
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,320
 was an oyster who could whistle.

681
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,360
 One of the most popular is so exciting.

682
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,880
 Also, who could whistle?

683
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,880
 Not that good.

684
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,880
 It was a person.

685
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,600
 Well, once you whistle, you get a person heard, I think.

686
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,600
 I think so.

687
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:38,080
 It didn't have a name, a bit like that goat, actually, yeah, thinking about it.

688
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,440
 But yeah, so, I mean, what is the most popular?

689
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,440
 I'm saying it's the most popular because a lot of people want to see it.

690
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,440
 Yeah.

691
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,440
 It was in Panto.

692
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:50,360
 That's quite popular.

693
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:55,520
 But this is a guy called George Perks, P-E-A-R-K-E-S.

694
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:00,000
 And he was an Oysterman and a dealer in Spruce Ginger Beer and British wines.

695
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,280
 So he's a wine seller and an Oyster seller.

696
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,800
 And he was sleeping in his house.

697
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:07,240
 And he was kept awake every night by this whistle.

698
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,240
 He was.

699
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,440
 He really was.

700
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,440
 He really was.

701
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:15,000
 And so he thought that it was a policeman who was walking past every day whistling.

702
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,480
 So anyway, so the whistling got louder and louder and then eventually he'd buy he was

703
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:25,720
 being burgled, he said, presumably by a whistling burglar.

704
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,120
 I don't know why I burglar would whistle, but yeah, he did that.

705
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,400
 And eventually he went downstairs with a pistol to get this burglar.

706
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,440
 And he found out that the source of the sound was one of his oysters.

707
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,840
 And it seems that what might have happened is that the oyster had a little hole in it.

708
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,720
 And whenever it was filtering food, so moving the water backwards and forwards, it was making

709
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,720
 the whistling sound.

710
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,720
 Right.

711
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,440
 And as soon as this became well known, it was mentioned in punch and a few other things.

712
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,720
 Suddenly everyone came round and wanted to see this oyster that could whistle.

713
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:58,240
 And even William Makepeace Thackery went to see it and wrote about it.

714
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,560
 And he said that he was there when an American gentleman declared that the oyster could

715
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:08,120
 not hold a candle to one he knew of in Massachusetts that could whistle Yankee Doodle from beginning

716
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,120
 to end.

717
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,120
 No, he could.

718
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,120
 I don't think that one's dreaming.

719
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:16,360
 But there is definitely was this oyster in 1860 and it was famous and it was in London and

720
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,360
 it could whistle.

721
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,360
 That's amazing.

722
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,360
 It's mad.

723
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,680
 Sorry, I've been reading a book by Thackray.

724
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:25,720
 So the idea of this literary hero going to see the whistling oyster on his day off is incredible.

725
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:29,360
 Can you see the influence of the whistling oyster on the kind of plot and themes of that?

726
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,360
 Very much.

727
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,360
 Absolutely.

728
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,360
 Yeah.

729
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:36,920
 I imagine having that guy working as your PR man because that is an unbelievable PR trick

730
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:40,520
 to claim you got a whistling oyster managed to get half of London to come and see it.

731
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,520
 That's amazing.

732
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,320
 Why they, why, how boring was life?

733
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,320
 Life was hard.

734
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,320
 Yeah.

735
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,400
 But with, I mean, if there was a, this was in Covent Garden, right, which is where we are now.

736
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:55,920
 If there was 100 meters away, there was a whistling oyster, which you'd read about in a magazine.

737
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:00,120
 Are you telling me as a QI researcher that you wouldn't be curious enough to go and see

738
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,120
 it?

739
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,400
 I do get pretty desperate to get away from you guys.

740
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,720
 I might go and see it.

741
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,440
 I don't, do people pay?

742
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,440
 They didn't pay.

743
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,600
 Only with their time.

744
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:12,240
 They didn't pay that, but it meant that it got people into his shop.

745
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:17,600
 And then the oyster, like I said, made a cameo appearance in a pantomime staged at Dory Lane

746
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,600
 in 1860.

747
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,600
 That's incredible.

748
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,600
 Who did he play?

749
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,600
 Doug Lysington.

750
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:27,200
 He mostly played some whistle and character with a shell.

751
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,360
 It would be really funny, though, to dress the oyster up in a big costume, wouldn't it?

752
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,920
 It would be amazing for a little bindle over his shoulder.

753
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,920
 Yeah.

754
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:40,480
 In the 1830s, just on paying for attractions, in the 1830s, you could pay a shilling to see

755
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,480
 a vase.

756
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,480
 Good.

757
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,480
 Could it even whistle?

758
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,480
 I didn't even whistle.

759
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,920
 Maybe if you blew into it the right way.

760
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,960
 It was the Royal Clarence vase.

761
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,960
 It was made for King George IV.

762
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,880
 Took work as three years, which is too long to make it one vase.

763
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,680
 And in fact, it should, you can go and see it.

764
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,680
 Wow.

765
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,680
 Didn't even have flowers in it.

766
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,680
 What was on it?

767
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:05,560
 I don't know. It was made partly of gold and glass and an amul.

768
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,880
 I remember I paid.

769
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:12,040
 I paid 20 quid to go and see Damien Hurst's skull, which had diamonds on it.

770
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,720
 That's not much worse than that, is it?

771
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,720
 No, you're right.

772
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,720
 You're a dupe.

773
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,720
 Oh.

774
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:20,960
 I've got another famous oyster.

775
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,880
 This is from the Sailor's magazine of 1840, which I've not checked how reliable it is

776
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,880
 in general.

777
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:32,480
 But this is what they say. There's a gentleman from Christchurch in Salisbury who keeps a pet

778
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,720
 oyster of the largest and finest breed.

779
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:44,760
 It has proved itself an excellent mouser, having already killed five mice by crushing the

780
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,680
 heads of such as tempted by it as a meal.

781
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:53,360
 They had the temerity to intrude their noses within his bivalvular clutches and then

782
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,480
 he crushed their heads.

783
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,040
 So that's not true, is it?

784
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:02,120
 What's at the Sailor's newsletter, Sailor's magazine at the Sailor's 1840?

785
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,120
 Yeah, it doesn't sound very true, does it?

786
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:10,940
 Yeah, I think you have checked it and you've found it to be one thing, terms of truthfulness.

787
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:16,080
 New Orleans, there used to be an act, just trying to find things about celebrities and

788
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,080
 oysters.

789
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,080
 Yeah.

790
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,080
 So there used to be an act in New Orleans.

791
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:25,040
 This is actually a lady who was Elvis Presley's cousin, she was called Kitty West.

792
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:31,560
 And she had an act called Evangeline the Oyster Girl in the 1940s which was a striptease

793
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:35,080
 which began in an enormous and slowly opening oyster shell.

794
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,080
 Oh, wow.

795
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:40,080
 So like that, is it butter-chelly painting where she's inside a huge clam?

796
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,080
 Exactly.

797
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,080
 Yeah.

798
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,080
 Exactly like that.

799
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,080
 But how did she make the shell open?

800
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,960
 Because you have to get professional shuckers to be able to open an oyster shell.

801
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,960
 I think it was a professional shucker by the side.

802
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:56,960
 That's a lever.

803
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,180
 I was looking for entertainers like the Oyster that we might have found around Covent Garden.

804
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:06,760
 And as you could have seen in 1830s, Spelterini and his living ass.

805
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,920
 And there's a poster of him and he looks incredible.

806
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:14,720
 So what he did is he had a ladder in his teeth and at the top of a ladder was a donkey.

807
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,000
 And in his two hands, he held 56 pound weights.

808
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,040
 So he was balancing a donkey on the top of a ladder held in his mouth.

809
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,040
 Wow.

810
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,840
 I'm kind of impressed by the donkey as well, being able to stay at the top of a ladder.

811
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,560
 Yeah, it was pretty chilled out, donkey, yeah.

812
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,560
 Yeah.

813
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,560
 Yeah.

814
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,560
 He was incredible.

815
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:35,200
 So apparently there was a liver puddleian guy called Sam Wilde who did the same thing when

816
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:40,560
 they were knobbing the crowd, which is the name for passing around the hat.

817
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,560
 Of course it is.

818
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,560
 Yeah, sure.

819
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,560
 Yeah, yeah.

820
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,080
 And they'd say, oh, we've got to have just one more shilling laser gentleman then up goes

821
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,080
 the donkey.

822
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,120
 That is amazing.

823
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,680
 That's a quick thinking performer who's been cheating on his wife.

824
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:56,640
 I was knobbing the crowd with like, which is when we had around the hat, of course.

825
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,360
 Amazing that you had one guy who's doing that and he was obviously so popular that another

826
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,680
 guy decided I'm going to do that exact same thing.

827
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,680
 How hard could it be?

828
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,360
 It's like the guy's in Yoda mask, isn't it?

829
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,160
 It's like a much more impressive version of that.

830
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,160
 Yeah.

831
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,160
 It's like a square.

832
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,160
 You frequently have three or four guys in Yoda masks.

833
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,160
 You do.

834
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:14,640
 And similarly with them and with this guy, you think they'd just do one little twist,

835
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:20,480
 maybe have a goat, not a donkey, maybe have a Gandalf mask, not a yoga mask.

836
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,480
 Brinds got talent.

837
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,480
 Would have been amazing back in the old days.

838
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,480
 It really would.

839
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,520
 If today there was a guy in Brinds got talent who had 56 pound weights in either hand and

840
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:31,120
 a donkey on a ladder in his teeth, he would win for me the final immediately.

841
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:35,800
 But really you need to kind of diversify for the later rounds, don't you?

842
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,640
 Because you can't just turn up and do the same thing again.

843
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,640
 Can you?

844
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,480
 I've never watched it, but I assume they do different things.

845
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,480
 I guess you must.

846
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:46,520
 The tragedy of Brinds got talent because this guy deserves to win forever.

847
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:53,560
 But you could dumb it down so you could start by holding a chair with a cat on it.

848
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:59,560
 So one thing you mentioned a policeman and whistles and I just I did wonder when about

849
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,600
 that, what did they use, what do we use before whistles, right?

850
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:07,760
 And it might it might become a knowledge, but in the design of the police whistle came

851
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:14,240
 in in like 1883 and it was out of a competition, a guy called Joseph Hudson, but before that

852
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,600
 they had hand rattles, the police.

853
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,600
 Really?

854
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,920
 That's really good.

855
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:22,680
 Like soccer referees use whistles, but before that they used to just wave hanker chains

856
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,000
 or something.

857
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 Yeah.

858
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,280
 And, but that's he also designed a referee whistle.

859
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,280
 Really?

860
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,840
 And then he also made something called the Acme Thunderer, which is a pea whistle.

861
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:35,600
 Oh, I've got, you've got a, my parents have one in the house, an Acme Thunderer.

862
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,600
 Yeah.

863
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,600
 Really?

864
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,760
 Have they kept you in check?

865
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,760
 Yes.

866
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:45,640
 No, I was too much of a sunflower for that.

867
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:49,600
 It was a wave to hanker chief of me when I was being naughty.

868
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:54,360
 And you're not supposed to eat oysters in a month with the letter R, are you?

869
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,360
 That's an old.

870
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,360
 Yeah.

871
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:00,160
 But it seems kind of possibly probably quite true.

872
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,240
 Certainly in the olden days where shellfish would spoil in the heat because they are months

873
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,720
 and mostly in the, in the summer, but also that usually is a spawning season.

874
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,880
 So, must the energy goes towards reproduction?

875
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,120
 Yeah, it's because when they go into their spawning seasons in your arm months, then they

876
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,960
 basically turn completely into gonads.

877
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:23,000
 They are fully made of testicles and ovaries, so all oyster tissue transforms when they're

878
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,960
 spawning into reproductive organs is like all of yourself just turning into a bunch of

879
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,960
 testicles.

880
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,960
 That's incredible.

881
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:33,960
 That's quite, I mean, that would make the dating scene a lot easier, wouldn't it?

882
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:37,480
 Because you wouldn't know if someone was upset.

883
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,480
 Yeah.

884
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,480
 They turned into a testicle.

885
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:45,600
 You still want to make sure you're in attractive enough testicle over it, with a good enough sense

886
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,600
 of humour.

887
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:50,400
 That's really, let's get you into an uber shall we?

888
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:55,200
 Manhandling, you'd testicle into the boot.

889
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:59,200
 Okay, that's it.

890
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,200
 That's all of our facts.

891
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,800
 Thank you so much for listening.

892
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,760
 We'll be back again next week with another four facts, and in the meantime, you can catch us

893
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,160
 on our Twitter feeds or you can catch these guys on their Twitter feed.

894
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,160
 So James is on.

895
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,160
 That's James Harkin.

896
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,160
 Andy's on.

897
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,160
 At Andrew Hunter M.

898
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,160
 Ed is.

899
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,160
 At Fox Tosser.

900
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:18,880
 The look of pain on your face when you knew you had to say it, but you made that for yourself.

901
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,880
 No, I didn't.

902
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,880
 My publisher did.

903
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,320
 That's fair enough.

904
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:27,600
 You can get me on podcast at qi.com and you can listen to all our previous episodes by

905
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:33,720
 going to know such things at fish.com, you can go to qi.com/fishevents to get tickets for

906
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,720
 our tour.

907
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:38,720
 And also, there's loads of information on that, such thing as a fish site on our book.

908
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,120
 And what's your book called then?

909
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,080
 Called the Golden Atlas.

910
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,640
 And you can get that in bookshops presumably.

911
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,640
 Everywhere I've been.

912
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,640
 Everywhere.

913
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,640
 All over the world.

914
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,640
 It is a beautiful book.

915
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,440
 You should definitely get it as soon as you've got ours, obviously, or by them at once.

916
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,040
 And we'll be back again next week.

917
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,040
 See you then.

918
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,040
 Goodbye.

919
00:40:55,040 --> 00:41:05,040
 [MUSIC]

920
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,620
 (upbeat music)
