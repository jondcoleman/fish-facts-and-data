00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.420
 So you don't want to go back to sleep?

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:20.040
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Things A Fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.280
 to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.000
 My name is Anna Toshinsky and I'm sitting here with James Arkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.740
 this week we are with Ed Brooke Hitching, our fellow QI Elf, who has just written a new book,

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:35.740
 right?

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:41.020
 Yes, it's called The Golden Atlas, a history of exploration, just filled with that kind

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.180
 of quirky QI style facts.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.260
 Yes, it is a really beautiful looking book full of amazing looking kind of maps and little

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.240
 factoids about exploration.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.080
 Get it now, go to Ed's Twitter feed or any book show after the show.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.960
 After the show, sorry, get it in, you know, however long it takes to listen to this.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.640
 It's available in any bookshop or online and for now, once again, we're gathered here

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.360
 with our four favourite facts from the last seven days in no particular order, here we go.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.360
 Starting with you, Ed.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:17.400
 So my fact is the most experienced sailor of all Captain Cook's First Voyage was a goat.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.400
 But yes, she previously sailed around the world.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.280
 When you say she was experienced, she didn't do any sailing, presumably, she was just on

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.280
 milk provision.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.360
 I don't think she was too, like, nifty with the ropes, if that's what I mean.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.760
 But yeah, she'd survived, like a global, like a circumnavigation, you know, I think she'd

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.600
 survived three shipwrecks as well.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.600
 Wow.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.600
 That's pretty amazing.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.600
 All for her milk.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.440
 So she was, yeah, a really impressive.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.440
 What was she called?

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.840
 Oh, she didn't have a name, but she's known as the well-traveled goat.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.880
 That is the first animal to travel around the world and in fact, wasn't she the first female

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.880
 to travel around the world?

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:52.880
 Yes, in the world.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:53.880
 And they didn't even give her a name.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.560
 They named her the well-traveled and then they got her species name at the end.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.560
 That's wrong with that.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.560
 Yeah.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.760
 But they gave her some jewelry, like, when she returned, safe and sound, she went to live

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:09.600
 in Marlend and they gave her a silver collar, and she was quite a fancy goat.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.640
 And then when she died, Dr. Johnson wrote her epitaph.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.960
 Do you think they brought her on because she was so experienced as well as her milk stuff?

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.240
 Like, because you could get milk from any goat, but this is a goat that's been on two

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.240
 different experts.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.600
 Yeah, she's probably there like a cigarette in her hand, like, no worries at all.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.920
 But I guess, well, she could have been thought of as a lucky goat if she'd survived Chebrax.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.920
 Yeah.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:31.920
 Definitely.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.920
 So that's something.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.200
 Captain Cook actually once did chase a goat across an entire island.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.200
 That's true.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.200
 Was it a big island?

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.520
 I don't know.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.080
 It was a stolen goat, though.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.080
 That's it.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.120
 So he, Captain Cook was making these voyages around the world, wasn't he?

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.280
 And the first one was scientific and the other two were discovering, you know, botanical

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.680
 things and lamb masses and that frequently things got next by the people he encountered,

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.520
 the aboriginals who he was meeting for the first time because there wasn't the same sense

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.080
 of property rights and ownership and things like that.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.400
 And some things he said, no, we should just let it go.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.720
 This doesn't matter.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.720
 And then, but other times, when it was an important thing for the mission, he was really

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.240
 a stickler for getting it back.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.920
 And we wanted the goat back because the third voyage, one of the missions was to introduce

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.680
 European livestock, so pairs of European livestock.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.200
 So if you've lost one goat, it's very, very hard to get goat breeding.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.520
 I can't remember if they didn't bring a spare, though, because you'd assume that a couple

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.520
 might go.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.040
 I would have brought five or six, I think.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.600
 Yeah, I mean, if we can just stock six ships worth of stuff, then that's fine.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.920
 I think it was quite crowded for space on these ships, Anna.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:36.920
 Fair enough.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.400
 You would have been the worst on Noah's Ark.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.920
 Why have you only got two of them?

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.960
 One of these didn't fancy each other.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.240
 Well, a lot of room on the ship would have been taken up with Sour Crout.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.880
 They brought several tons of Sour Crout, because Captain Cook was one of the first to realize

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:58.840
 that scurvy could be treated with vitamins, and he didn't quite understand why, but he

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.640
 had to convince no one like Sour Crout, so the way that he convinces Cruder to eat it was

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:08.040
 to serve his officers in a really fancy way, and so the crew would get jealous and think,

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.880
 "Oh, this must be something worth," stuff like that.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.080
 Nouvelle Quizzine, Sour Crout.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.080
 Yeah, exactly.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:19.640
 That's a nice, white tablecloth, just a dumpload of Sour Crout.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:20.640
 That's really clever.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.600
 Did you know that one of his expeditions had his ostensible mission and then his secret mission?

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:31.600
 So this is his 1768 expedition, when he was officially going to Tahiti, he was supposed

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.320
 to observe the transit of Venus across the face of the sun and do a bunch of other scientific

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.320
 stuff.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.040
 But the British government told him, "Do this, but here's a sealed envelope, and when

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.440
 you've done that, you're allowed to open this sealed envelope, and that contains a secret

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.440
 information for what you're actually supposed to do."

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.440
 It's like Taskmaster.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:54.280
 It was such an extreme long episode of Taskmaster.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.920
 And yeah, he opened the envelope when he'd done his Tahiti business, and it said, "Please

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.480
 find the great Southern continent."

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.480
 Everyone was convinced there was a big continent down in the South Pole, and they were right.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.280
 Obviously, but he tried to find it and failed.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:11.840
 They knew something was there and it was all based on, sort of, like, sightings of little islands,

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:12.840
 maybe ice flows.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:13.840
 Yeah.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.520
 But yeah, on the second voyage, they passed a cook and his men passed within 70 miles of

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.880
 Antarctica and didn't find it.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:21.880
 Wow.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:22.880
 That's so frustrating.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:23.880
 How do we know?

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.920
 Do they leave footprint in the sea?

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:27.920
 What of where they went?

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:28.920
 Yeah.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:29.920
 No, they have maps.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:30.920
 Oh, yeah.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:31.920
 They were riding it all down.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:41.120
 It's full of maps.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.160
 I've been reading about the ship itself, the Endeavour.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.840
 This is a very famous ship, but it was such an unglamorous ship.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.200
 So it was a coal-carrying ship, which is not, you know, very glam.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.200
 It wasn't very fast.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.640
 It could only go about six or seven knots at nautical miles an hour.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.280
 But nonetheless, it was incredibly hardy because it was designed to carry coal around and

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.040
 it was built to last.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.400
 So it did all these voyages.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.960
 It hit the Great Barrier Reef once.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.280
 He just bumped into the Great Barrier Reef, and it tore a hole in the side of the ship and

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.320
 they had to dump six cannon overboard immediately.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.320
 So it wouldn't sink.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.960
 Probably damaged the coral as well.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:19.960
 Oh, yeah.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:20.960
 But who cares?

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.360
 I mean, like I was just thinking that's effectively a footprint of the sea, isn't it?

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.360
 Yes.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.360
 That's how we know.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.280
 So I didn't mean that about who cares its coral.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.800
 I care a lot about the Great Barrier Reef.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:30.800
 Sorry.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:31.800
 I get it.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.080
 But scientists spent 200 years trying to find the cannon that he ditched overboard.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.880
 And they knew that he'd been around there because they left charts and maps saying where

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:39.880
 they'd been.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:45.080
 But no one could actually find the exact cannon until 1969 when they went there with a magnetometer

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.400
 looking for the iron of the cannons, testing for magnetism as a barrier reef, yeah.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.400
 Very clever.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:54.320
 Well, because we also recently found quite recently found the Endeavour itself, didn't

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.320
 we?

00:06:55.320 --> 00:07:01.660
 So the Endeavour was actually two ships in a way, because he used it, 17, you know, 17,

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.040
 17, 16, 17, 17, 17, he used it.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.240
 And then it was renamed and repurposed.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.440
 It became the Lord's Sandwich.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:13.920
 And it took place in the Battle of Brooklyn, 1776, so one of the largest ships used there.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.680
 And we only found out in the 1990s that that was the same ship.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.880
 So I find that really weird that ships are fully repurposed.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:25.840
 But it was called the Lord's Sandwich, Captain Cook was killed on the Sandwich Islands.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.320
 It all comes full circle.

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.560
 Like the world he travelled around.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.560
 Of course.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.720
 Yeah, he was, what happened to him?

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:35.720
 He was baked.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.720
 Was he?

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.720
 Well, part of the big parcel some more?

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:38.720
 There's a big popular method.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.720
 He was eaten, wasn't there?

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.720
 Yeah, he wasn't eaten.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.520
 He was just baked, so his bones could be removed and treated respectfully.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:45.520
 Okay.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:46.520
 He's a big honour to be baked.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:50.400
 I don't think I'd like to watch the Sandwich Islands version of the Great Sandwich

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.400
 Island Bake-Off.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:56.560
 But yeah, he was chopped up into little bits as well, wasn't he?

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:02.800
 So this is when he arrived on Hawaii with his crew and they thought he was a god for a

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.800
 while.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.160
 They thought the whole crew were gods because they weren't in the middle of their big festival

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.080
 at the time, worshipping gods.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.840
 And then one of their crew died, which really screwed things up for them because they thought

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.960
 they were immortal and then it turned out they weren't immortal.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.680
 And so relationships went a bit sour.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:22.780
 And then he sailed away and then rough seas swept him back and they got into fights and

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:24.080
 they ended up killing him.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:28.720
 But the Hawaiians came and delivered all his bones in a sack, didn't they?

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.520
 I think one of his compatriots said.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.520
 There's another weird link.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:37.840
 You said that Dr. Johnson wrote the epitaph for the goat, the well-travel goat.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.920
 So this was after one of Captain Cook's missions.

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.320
 He brought back a kangaroo.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.640
 They discovered so much new stuff.

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:50.340
 They brought back 30,000 botanical species, 250 new fish and five mammals, including a kangaroo.

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:56.440
 And this is a story of a dinner in 1773 where Dr. Johnson was so excited that Captain Cook

00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:00.920
 had discovered a kangaroo that he did an impression of it for all the other guests, despite the

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:01.920
 lack.

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:02.920
 He'd never seen one.

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.740
 Okay, so here's the account.

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:07.320
 He stood erect, put out his hands like feelers.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.320
 This is Dr. Johnson.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:12.560
 He put out his hands like feelers and gathering up the tails of his huge brown coat so as to

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:17.360
 resemble the pouch of the animal, made two or three vigorous bounds across the room.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.360
 What?

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:21.400
 I mean, considering he's never seen one before, that does sound like a kangaroo.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:22.400
 Yeah.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.400
 It's perfect.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.640
 I would have been fooled.

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:29.320
 Why do we keep calling him Captain Cook when he wasn't a captain?

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.320
 Ooh.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.000
 Why do we call him Captain Cook when he wasn't a captain?

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 No.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 He wasn't a cook either.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 No, man.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 He's a fraud.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.680
 My assumed tea was a naval captain.

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:43.680
 He was a lieutenant when he was on Endeavour and then when he came back to England, he was

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.040
 given the rank of commander.

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:52.440
 And then by 1775, he became a post-captain, which was even better than a captain, but he was

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.920
 never actually a captain.

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:54.920
 That's so funny.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:55.920
 Yeah.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.720
 So he'd just leapfrog's captain, see?

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:58.720
 Yeah.

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:01.240
 He didn't even need to be a captain, but we still call him Captain Cook.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.240
 It listarates, doesn't it?

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.240
 That's the thing.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.240
 You're right.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.240
 Good to be in Corporal Cook.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.240
 Commander Cook.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.240
 He was a commander.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.240
 Yeah.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.600
 So someone who's a captain of two ships, more than one ship?

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.600
 I think you are.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:16.080
 If you're a captain of one ship, but you also have another ship under your command, you're

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.080
 then a commander.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:20.000
 So it's kind of natural to call someone captain, even though they're a commander.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 I think so.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 I think if someone said where's the captain, they'd say, "Oh, we don't have a captain."

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 Yeah.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.680
 Unfortunately, I've come on a misconception.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:32.040
 It's kind of a naval emergency.

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.920
 Pets on naval pets?

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.040
 So naval pets were a big deal.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.600
 So much so that there was a sailor zoo in the 19th century.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.400
 It was set up in Portsmouth in 1893.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:47.720
 And by 1935, they had lions and various marsupials and birds in aviaries, and with a couple

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:48.920
 of people all taking pets.

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:51.840
 So you mean that sailors had pet lions on their boats?

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:57.840
 Well, it seems like it expanded this naval zoo to incorporate things that possibly hadn't

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:58.840
 accompanied the sailors.

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.520
 But how did they get there, James?

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:01.520
 How did they...

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:02.680
 Yeah, they couldn't fly in those days.

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.480
 There was no Euro Tunnel.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:10.040
 They did find a polar bear, some British sailors, and they just took it onto their ship.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.760
 And they took it to Wayland.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:12.760
 Yeah.

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:13.760
 They rescued it.

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:14.760
 It was a cub when they rescued it.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:17.480
 And it was on some ice off Greenland, and they made it the ship's mascot and called it

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.480
 Barbara.

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:23.040
 Do you think she's an apparently funny name for a polar bear?

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:31.440
 All right, there's time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:38.600
 My fact this week is that for 150 years, Shakespeare's play The Tragedy of King Lear had a happy

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:39.600
 ending.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.360
 Did they still call it The Tragedy of?

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.360
 No, they didn't.

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:45.280
 They slightly tweet the title, because they thought it might not work.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:49.520
 So I read this in the conversation, and I can't believe I didn't know it, but basically

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:52.880
 people didn't like the fact that King Lear had a sad ending, which spoiler alert it does.

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:56.480
 I mean, really, really sad ending, it's The Tragedy.

00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:03.560
 So it was sort of adapted by this writer called Neham Tate in 1681, and he rewrote it, and

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:08.560
 he called it the historical play of King Lear and his three daughters to remove the awkward

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:09.760
 word tragedy.

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.600
 And yeah, at the end, Cordelia saves King Lear.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.360
 He puts her on the throne.

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:18.080
 There's a little love affair between her and remember Edgar and King Lear, who's kind

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.400
 of another nice guy.

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:23.440
 I don't think there's any flirting with Cordelia and Edgar in the original.

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:25.840
 And yeah, everyone lives happily ever after.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:30.880
 So in the original, Lear dies, Cordelia dies, everyone dies.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:31.880
 Everyone dies.

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.160
 Almost everyone has a tiny closing experience.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.880
 We all die, Andy.

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:35.880
 Yeah, this is all right.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.840
 It's a very concertina, then there is a death, that way.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:43.680
 It's a classic Shakespeare tragedy, isn't it, where within the space is about five minutes,

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.800
 about 12 people dropped dead one after death.

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.040
 It's a very high body count.

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.280
 Do you think he just gets to the end?

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:51.440
 And he's like, oh, I've only got 100 words left.

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.440
 I'm just going to have to kill everyone.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.800
 He's not doing an essay, James, I don't think he had a word count.

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:58.360
 I've gone way over.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.360
 This is the way I think.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:03.920
 The original that Shakespeare borrowed from was not a tragedy.

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:07.240
 I mean, it didn't have this incredibly tragic ending where everyone dies.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.880
 So the rewritten version that you're talking about, and it was kind of a return to the

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.880
 previous edition, there was an ancient version called, there's a thing called Holland Shed's

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.560
 Chronicles, which has a lot of stories of kings and Shakespeare got a lot of plots

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:18.560
 from that.

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:24.480
 But King Lear, Shakespeare's version was in 1606, and it drew heavily on a play from

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.680
 1594.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:27.680
 That's crazy, isn't it?

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.680
 The play was for the true Chronicle history of the life and death of King Lear and his

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:31.680
 three daughters.

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:34.080
 But that guy's still going to be alive, probably.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.080
 He's still alive.

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.080
 He's still alive.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.080
 I mean, that is, like, remaking die hard.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:39.400
 That was about 30 years ago.

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.920
 This is about half the time from die hard till now.

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:44.280
 Yeah, but die hard too was much closer than that.

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.240
 Yeah, but it wasn't a remake by people.

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:47.240
 I don't think he did.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:49.920
 Did the die hard makers sue the makers of die hard too?

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:50.920
 I was stealing the hide.

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:55.320
 Actually, what about Mary Poppins, they were about to redo that, aren't they?

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.320
 Or maybe they just have?

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:57.320
 That's true.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:58.320
 That's controversial.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:59.320
 And that was about 50 years ago, wasn't it?

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.320
 Yeah.

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.320
 So people are saying that's too soon.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.120
 So maybe this is why he had to kill off all the characters, so that it wasn't too close

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.320
 to the original that he could be sued.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.320
 Maybe.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:12.640
 Do you think you can do that, just take any of the show, any other movie and make it exactly

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:15.120
 the same, but at the end just kill off all the characters?

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.120
 Yeah.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.120
 What's the good film from early 2000s?

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:20.880
 I think we should just rewrite all 10 series of friends.

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:21.880
 Last episode.

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:22.880
 Everyone dies.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:23.880
 Everyone dies.

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:26.880
 Do you know the reason why Nahem Tate changed the ending?

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.880
 They were all little sunflowers.

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:30.880
 No, what is it?

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:31.880
 What's it called?

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:32.880
 Snowflakes.

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:33.880
 Snowflakes.

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:37.080
 That's what we are in the summer with Snowflakes in the winter.

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.080
 Exactly.

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.080
 Snowflakes.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.080
 Snowflakes.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:41.080
 Snowflakes.

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.560
 Snowflakes, aren't they?

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:49.080
 Kind of, but I think it's because the players about the king being usurped.

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:54.080
 And when Nahem Tate was writing it was the 1680s, which is Charles II is on the throne.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.840
 He's a bit sore about his father being executed and usurped.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:02.200
 So Restoration Theatre was quite careful with various themes like that.

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.200
 Wow.

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.240
 And didn't they stop doing King Lear in George III's time?

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:07.240
 Oh, really?

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:10.560
 Because he was mentally ill, let's put it that way.

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:15.600
 But he read King Lear and had a bout of mental illness after having read King Lear.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:16.600
 Really?

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:20.680
 And they put him in a straight jacket and tied him down and he was described as agitated

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:24.840
 and confused and he ended up in bed for weeks afterwards, because he'd read King Lear.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:28.000
 And I don't know how the thought that it was to do with him.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 Wow.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000
 Maybe it's a dangerous book.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.760
 Samuel Johnson didn't like it, even though he published one of those several times.

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:34.760
 No, Kangaroos in it.

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:35.760
 No, no Kangaroos.

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:43.000
 No, I didn't do an impression of the Mad King as well.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.240
 And no, he read the whole thing with only Kangaroos' character.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.880
 I genuinely have a fact about that.

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:51.400
 Oh, my God.

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:56.480
 In 2014, there was an English playwright who staged a version of King Lear called King Lear

00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:02.120
 with sheep, which features one human character and then about nine sheep.

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:03.680
 And he's trying to direct a King Lear.

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:06.920
 The character in the play is trying to direct King Lear with sheep.

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:08.600
 And they disobey him.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.560
 And he goes mad and starts acting out the narrative himself.

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:15.120
 And she said, "I wanted to use the idea of non-cooperative actors to explore the themes

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:18.960
 of King Lear, because there's a big scene where Cordelia doesn't do anything when she's

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:19.960
 told to."

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:22.600
 And she also said, "It's cheaper than paying actual actors."

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:29.800
 Okay, I've got a fact about that, which is kind of linked, which is that Neham Tate,

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:36.080
 as well as doing this play, he also wrote the song, "While Shepherds watch their flocks."

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.080
 Wow.

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:40.840
 Which is the earliest English Carol written that we're still singing the original words

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:41.520
 of.

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:44.880
 And he would have loved this new relation.

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:50.400
 I should just say to finish off the Samuel Johnson thing, for those sheep redirected us,

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:54.440
 he said that King Lear really troubled him, so it caused him extreme discomfort.

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:58.720
 And even though he published his edition in 1765, he found the death of Cordelia so upsetting

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.240
 that he never ever read it again.

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:01.240
 He refused to read it again.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:04.240
 And that his editor was literally like, "You have to look at these pages to work out

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:05.240
 what we're going to cut."

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:07.040
 Because he said it was so traumatic.

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:08.040
 Wow.

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:12.720
 Really, Victorians found Shakespeare very horrible.

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:13.720
 We wrote a lot of them.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:17.880
 I mean, would it make me think of you talking about like sensitivity to kings being overthrown?

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.120
 Do you know the movie "Doctor Strange Love?"

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:21.120
 I know it hadn't.

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:26.800
 They filmed an alternate ending, so it ends with a big sort of dog strain of getting out

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:31.760
 of his wheelchair and miraculously walking, and then the world blows up.

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:37.760
 But there was a filmed custard pie fight in the war, and there are photos of it.

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:41.960
 You can Google it, and you can see Peter says everyone throwing cream pies at each other.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:42.960
 That's amazing.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:43.960
 Yeah, that sounds great.

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.720
 And he effectively went with the Shakespeare ending, didn't he?

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:47.720
 Were everyone dice?

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:48.720
 Yeah.

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:49.720
 Oh, yeah.

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:50.720
 Really?

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:51.720
 Yeah.

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:52.720
 I did a little work on "Mayhem Tate."

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:53.720
 Oh, yeah.

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.720
 You know, his father was called "Faithful Teet."

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:56.720
 Wow.

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:57.720
 Wow.

00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:02.720
 I mean, that's a strong name, isn't it?

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:03.720
 Yeah.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:04.720
 Faithful Teet.

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:07.520
 That's also the name of one of the goats that went around the world.

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:08.520
 Yeah.

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.040
 And then I guess he changed his name.

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:13.040
 He didn't want to be called "Teet" anymore, so "Mayhem Tate Master" changed it.

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.040
 But he was a big deal.

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:15.040
 He was poet laureate.

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:16.040
 Was it?

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:18.040
 No, I mean, "Teet" was, as well, I think.

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:19.040
 Oh, sorry.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.040
 That's what I mean, "Mayhem Tate" was.

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:21.040
 Yeah.

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:22.040
 "Washepers Watched Their Flogs By Night."

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:27.520
 For the next century, it was the only carol that was allowed in Church of England,

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:28.520
 ceremonies or services.

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:29.520
 Really?

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:30.520
 They hated carols.

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:32.760
 But this was just religious enough to kind of pass master.

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:36.160
 But at Christmas, would you do the thing where you sing eight carols, but you just had

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.160
 to sing "Washepers Watched Their Flogs By Night."

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:39.160
 Eight times.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.680
 Yeah, like a carol service will be just the same thing all the time.

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:48.160
 And if you'll now turn your pages to carol number five, "Washepers Watched."

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:52.320
 And the only change that's been made over the last 300 years, according to Wikipedia,

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:53.320
 this is.

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:58.600
 And the only change that's been made has been changing the word from wilds to wild, so

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:00.080
 from wilds to shepherds.

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:03.680
 And the other changes where they changed it to "Washepers Watched Their Socks."

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:06.680
 That was the other one of cars, but.

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:09.800
 That was the original.

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:12.560
 Tite de San Dronecus was also changed.

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:18.680
 In Tite de San Dronecus in 1850, there's this big rape scene where a woman has a tongue

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:22.600
 cut out and her hands cut off and it's to prevent her spilling the names of her attackers.

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.840
 And that was all completely edited.

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:29.040
 There was a version of Hamla where a failure dies from accidental drowning, because it was

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:31.800
 thought to be too upsetting that it was suicide.

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:37.240
 But I think people are often saying that we're a bit too pathetic now, but too snowflakey.

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:43.080
 It was Baudler who did the accidental drowning, wasn't it, from whom we get Baudler right?

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:47.240
 It's a really cool fan theory about him, it's just a theory, actually, I don't know why you say it.

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.240
 About Baudler?

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:52.600
 Yeah, so he published this thing called "The Family Shakespeare," because he was saying

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:54.520
 that all families can read together.

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:57.680
 So if you're reading out to your children, you don't want to read a rape scene where

00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:03.200
 some of us get the tongue cut out and hands cut off, which is kind of reasonable.

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:07.160
 So there's also lots of naughty stuff, you know, there are characters who are prostitutes

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.920
 and all that had to go.

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:12.880
 But there's a theory that it wasn't the Reverend Thomas Baudler who did most of the cutting,

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:14.640
 it was his sister.

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:17.760
 She did most of the cutting and she produced the first version.

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:22.560
 But Baudler claimed to have written it so that his sister didn't have to publicly admit

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.800
 that she had understood the root bits.

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:28.480
 That's so funny, maybe.

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:29.480
 Wow.

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:35.320
 When he was 40, just over 40, Baudler married a lady called Elizabeth Frevenon and it was

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:39.960
 such a bad marriage that they split up quite quickly and nobody in the family was ever

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:42.840
 allowed to mention Elizabeth's name ever again.

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:45.400
 So his whole life was Baudlerized basically.

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:46.400
 Wow.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:47.400
 That's awesome.

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:48.400
 That's great.

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.440
 God, he was very free and easy with editing.

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:51.440
 Basically, isn't he?

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:55.160
 The editing is live out of the life.

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:59.440
 Queen Victoria said she'd never had the courage to see the Mary Wives of Windsor.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.040
 She wrote to her daughter who was a Shakespeare fan.

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:05.520
 She never had the courage to see it because she'd always been told how very cool it was.

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:07.280
 And it's very boring.

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.480
 I've never read or seen that one.

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:10.480
 There's a thing.

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:13.840
 People say that he wrote it in nine days and I'll be honest, I'm staggered.

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:16.280
 It took him that long to write that way.

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:18.640
 Isn't the least good I've ever read.

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:22.720
 Maybe she just thought it was really dull but didn't want to upset Shakespeare fans.

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.320
 I said I've heard it's too rude.

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:27.440
 Yeah, she didn't she found him but too close for her taste generally.

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:31.320
 There have been 24 opera's based on Romeo and Juliet.

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:38.080
 The earliest is called Romeo and Juliet, which is quite cool and that has a happy ending.

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:43.800
 And also if you go on fanfic.com and look for some fanfiction on Romeo and Juliet, there

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:47.680
 is a thing called Romeo and Juliet happy ending.

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:52.760
 And at the end it's just it's like a final scene of Romeo and Juliet and it says days become

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:57.420
 days and years become years and one day Freya Lawrence gets a letter saying that Juliet had

00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:01.960
 died in a sleep and later that year he gets the same letter from the Montague's that Romeo

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:02.960
 has died in his sleep.

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.960
 That's a nice ending isn't it?

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:08.160
 But he's substantially older than both of those characters isn't it?

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.920
 So they've still died quite young.

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:11.920
 Yeah.

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:17.640
 I just got one more thing about modern day, about modern day kind of censorship.

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:18.640
 And prudishness.

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:23.800
 So did you see the Cambridge University put trigger warnings on lots of it Shakespeare lectures?

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:26.080
 And people got really exercised about this.

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:27.080
 Really?

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.080
 Yeah.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:30.080
 Just for like some flowers who couldn't really do.

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:31.080
 Some flowers.

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:32.080
 Yeah.

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:34.120
 So I think this is why this conversation article came out.

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:38.440
 It was saying don't worry people have always done this, but if you take English literature

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:43.400
 at Cambridge, then if you go to a lecture for instance on Titus Andronicus or in fact

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:47.480
 on Euripides the Back Eye, that's another one that has them, then you get a little one

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:51.880
 of those exclamation marks in a red triangle at the end of the lecture, which is to say this

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:53.480
 might contain some traumatic themes.

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:54.480
 Oh my god.

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:55.480
 Yeah.

00:22:55.480 --> 00:23:00.480
 If you have been troubled by any of the themes in Titus Andronicus.

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.960
 You've had a rough old life actually.

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:03.960
 Yeah.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:04.960
 That is tough.

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:08.800
 If your sons have been baked in a pie.

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:15.680
 Okay, let's move on to fact number three.

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:17.600
 That is Andy's fact.

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:21.760
 My fact is that some advertisers have started putting single pixels on mobile phones ads

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:26.040
 so you think it's dust, try to wipe it off and accidentally click on the advert.

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:27.040
 It is.

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:28.040
 It's genius.

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:29.040
 That is so good.

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:30.040
 Yeah.

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:31.920
 So I've only found one advertiser that's done this.

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:35.120
 There's a great article on Medium called 52 Things I Learned This Yeah, and this is one

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.720
 of the 52 things.

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.000
 But it doesn't really work, right?

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.800
 I read another article I think it was.

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:45.320
 I'm not sure where I read this, but basically they said if you get paid for every time someone

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:50.360
 taps on it, then it works, but if you're trying to get actual sales, then it pisses people

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:53.280
 off so much that people end up not buying stuff.

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:58.680
 I guess they must be thinking the product is so good that someone will end up buying it.

00:23:58.680 --> 00:23:59.680
 And what was the product?

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:01.560
 Oh, I can't remember, I'm afraid.

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:03.360
 I do know another one who's done a really similar thing.

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:09.320
 There's a Chinese trainer manufacturer and they've put a thing that looks like a hair across

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:14.000
 their advert and you swipe to get rid of the hair and you go straight to their website.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 Yeah.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 I got banned from Instagram, didn't I?

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:22.520
 Apparently, it violated Instagram's policies and was removed and they Instagram shut down

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:23.840
 the entire brand's account.

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:24.840
 Wow.

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:25.840
 Because of that.

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:26.840
 Yeah.

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:28.240
 I can't believe it's not counterproductive.

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.320
 I like you say.

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:30.320
 It's just so irritating.

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:36.000
 There was a study a few years ago that found that 50% of ad clicks on phones are accidental.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 I'm surprised.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 I'm surprised.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 I'm surprised it's not low.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.560
 I don't think I've ever intentionally clicked on one.

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:46.180
 What phone is so smashed up that if there was something that looks a bit like a hair, you

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:47.180
 would never see it.

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:48.180
 No, absolutely not.

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:50.280
 This bit would not work on me at all.

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:53.920
 The thing it reminded me of is, and I was desperately looking for like a source for it,

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:57.080
 but it's something my American grandmother told me and I've heard it mentioned on an American

00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:01.200
 podcast as well that in the old days when you were making a telephone call and you call

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:05.420
 into the exchange, you could choose which company would carry your call, so which one

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:06.680
 would get your money, right?

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:07.680
 Really?

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:08.680
 Wow.

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:13.040
 The most common answer was, you know, I don't care whatever, whichever one you choose.

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:18.040
 And so people started phone companies called, I don't care, it doesn't matter whatever you

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:19.040
 want.

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:21.040
 And they'd rake in this sort of extreme.

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.040
 Incredible.

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:23.040
 Yeah, it's genius.

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:27.720
 Do you know on the internet, if you click on a naughty site, you might get a whole load

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:28.720
 of pop-ups, right?

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:29.720
 All right.

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:30.720
 Lots of pop-up things.

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:31.720
 Oh, you do know that.

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:32.720
 The one.

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:33.720
 I'm afraid about it.

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:35.720
 If people with pornographers digest it, yeah.

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:40.520
 They're called "Pornados" or "PonStombs".

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:46.480
 This is a phrase coined by John C. Dvořák, who is the nephew of the guy who invented the

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:51.920
 Dvořák Keyboard, which is like a Quarty Keyboard, but it's supposed to be slightly better

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:52.920
 than the Quarty Keyboard.

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:57.120
 That's a step down, isn't it, in far the sun, invention in terms?

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:58.120
 Yeah.

00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:05.040
 Well, Dvořák, he writes a lot about computers and he said that the recent Apple's Macintosh

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:09.800
 computer would not be successful is because it uses a pointing device called a mouse.

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:13.320
 And there is no evidence that people want to use these things.

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:15.080
 And then he wrote about Steve Jobs.

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:20.320
 Maybe when the smoke clears, we will have heard the last of Steve Jobs as guru, CEO, visionary.

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:25.680
 He'll go the way of the pet rock, electric carving knives, silly putty, tiny Tim and the

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:27.280
 three-tone paint job.

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:29.720
 That's not really rough on tiny Tim.

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:30.720
 Yeah.

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:36.320
 A load of African products and then one of the most heart-rending characters on a literature.

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:37.320
 So big.

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:40.360
 Squashed up next to silly putty.

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:44.040
 I can only imagine maybe tiny Tim as something else in America, right?

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.040
 I guess so.

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.880
 Probably like a failed product or something.

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:52.120
 But like, you know, it'll go the way of C. Monkeys, nasal hair trimmers and Jude the Obscure.

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:54.960
 That's a weird spoon.

00:26:54.960 --> 00:27:00.520
 Do you know why pop-up ads were originally conceived?

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:01.520
 No.

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:06.880
 It was because advertisers didn't want to be associated with dodgy website content.

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:09.960
 So it's kind of the opposite of problems that websites have now, where sometimes dodgy

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:11.920
 adverts pop-up on them.

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:15.400
 So they were invented by a guy called Mr. Zuckerman in the 1990s.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:19.960
 And it was because a car company got upset because it bought a banner advert on a page that

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:26.560
 happened to be about anal sex, which they thought wasn't on brand for their car company.

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:28.960
 It's unlikely to be on brand for any car company.

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:29.960
 Not exactly.

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:31.600
 There's so little overlap there.

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:35.480
 And so he made pop-up ads to kind of distinguish them from each other.

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:38.960
 And he says that he was wrong with sales.

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:41.800
 It's just a kind of sex.

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:42.800
 I know.

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:47.400
 It's the way you say a page that happened to be about it.

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:50.400
 By chance, it was an anal sex theme page.

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:51.400
 They exist.

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:52.400
 I suppose so.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:53.400
 They're out there.

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:54.400
 Hang on.

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:57.600
 The car adverts were popping up on this themed page.

00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:58.600
 Yeah.

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:00.440
 It was all sorts of things popping up.

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:03.240
 They weren't up for it.

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:06.480
 So he designed this pop-up thing, which is supposed to say, look, this pop-up has nothing

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:08.360
 to do with the content of this web page.

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:10.200
 But he's really apologised for it now.

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:13.560
 He says he feels terribly guilty, because he knows that pop-ups are the most annoying thing

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:14.560
 on the internet.

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:16.000
 But his intentions were good.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.920
 He didn't want cars to be associated with sexual positions.

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:23.880
 So other stupid creative ways of advertising?

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:26.840
 Domino's this year, advertised in potholes.

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:31.120
 So this is the thing where they've now got a sideline in fixing potholes on roads across

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.120
 America.

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:35.880
 And you can actually request that they come and fix your pothole if you're in America.

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.760
 And I think it's an advertising campaign.

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:39.320
 Otherwise, they're just really good guys.

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:42.560
 But it's called paving for pizza.

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:47.320
 And they partner with various local administrations and say, hey, have you got any potholes that need

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:48.320
 doing?

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:52.640
 And they send out their pizza delivery guys who do a sideline in kind of tarmac filling.

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:53.800
 And then they fill in the potholes.

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:56.400
 And then they fill in the pothole with little Domino's pizza logo.

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:57.400
 I'm sorry.

00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:00.920
 It's not very long lasting at all.

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:01.920
 Wow.

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:02.920
 That's quite good, isn't it?

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:03.920
 Yeah.

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:04.920
 That's a good idea.

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:05.920
 So they get their logo on the road.

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:07.520
 But everyone gets flat roads.

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:08.520
 So everyone's a winner.

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:09.520
 Wow.

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:11.360
 Apart from the other pizza manufacturers.

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:12.360
 Yeah.

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:15.120
 Papa John is furious.

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:17.880
 The justification was that potholes damaged pizzas.

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:21.720
 So they're actually saving the pizzas because on the way, they'll get bumped up and down.

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.840
 They actually put a GoPro inside a pizza box.

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:30.360
 And how people watch the traumatic journey they have to go through to make it to their destination.

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:31.360
 Wow.

00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:32.360
 Yeah.

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:35.240
 OKFC advertises on fire hydrants.

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:36.240
 They do this.

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:41.040
 I think a couple of years ago, they'll pay people to let them fix their fire hydrants if they're

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:42.040
 broken.

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:43.040
 They do this in Indianapolis.

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:46.120
 So they paid, I think, $5,000 to say, can we fix your fire hydrant?

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:48.200
 And the town was like, yeah, great.

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:50.680
 And then they sort of put some KFC advertising on top of it.

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:54.040
 But they do also fill up the fire hydrant with chicken.

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:58.120
 But then all the fire smelled delicious.

00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:04.520
 You don't mind burning to a crisp with a delicious smell of KFC all around you.

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:11.520
 OK, onto our final fact of the week.

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:13.000
 And that is James' Facts.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.960
 OK, my fact this week is that one of the most popular celebrities in London in 1860,

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:22.320
 was an oyster who could whistle.

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:25.360
 One of the most popular is so exciting.

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:26.880
 Also, who could whistle?

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:27.880
 Not that good.

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:28.880
 It was a person.

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:31.600
 Well, once you whistle, you get a person heard, I think.

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:32.600
 I think so.

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:38.080
 It didn't have a name, a bit like that goat, actually, yeah, thinking about it.

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:41.440
 But yeah, so, I mean, what is the most popular?

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:44.440
 I'm saying it's the most popular because a lot of people want to see it.

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:45.440
 Yeah.

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:46.440
 It was in Panto.

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:50.360
 That's quite popular.

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:55.520
 But this is a guy called George Perks, P-E-A-R-K-E-S.

00:30:55.520 --> 00:31:00.000
 And he was an Oysterman and a dealer in Spruce Ginger Beer and British wines.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.280
 So he's a wine seller and an Oyster seller.

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:03.800
 And he was sleeping in his house.

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:07.240
 And he was kept awake every night by this whistle.

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:08.240
 He was.

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:09.440
 He really was.

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:10.440
 He really was.

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:15.000
 And so he thought that it was a policeman who was walking past every day whistling.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.480
 So anyway, so the whistling got louder and louder and then eventually he'd buy he was

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:25.720
 being burgled, he said, presumably by a whistling burglar.

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:28.120
 I don't know why I burglar would whistle, but yeah, he did that.

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:31.400
 And eventually he went downstairs with a pistol to get this burglar.

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:35.440
 And he found out that the source of the sound was one of his oysters.

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:38.840
 And it seems that what might have happened is that the oyster had a little hole in it.

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:42.720
 And whenever it was filtering food, so moving the water backwards and forwards, it was making

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:43.720
 the whistling sound.

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:44.720
 Right.

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:49.440
 And as soon as this became well known, it was mentioned in punch and a few other things.

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:53.720
 Suddenly everyone came round and wanted to see this oyster that could whistle.

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:58.240
 And even William Makepeace Thackery went to see it and wrote about it.

00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:02.560
 And he said that he was there when an American gentleman declared that the oyster could

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:08.120
 not hold a candle to one he knew of in Massachusetts that could whistle Yankee Doodle from beginning

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:09.120
 to end.

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:10.120
 No, he could.

00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:11.120
 I don't think that one's dreaming.

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:16.360
 But there is definitely was this oyster in 1860 and it was famous and it was in London and

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:17.360
 it could whistle.

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:18.360
 That's amazing.

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:19.360
 It's mad.

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:20.680
 Sorry, I've been reading a book by Thackray.

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:25.720
 So the idea of this literary hero going to see the whistling oyster on his day off is incredible.

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:29.360
 Can you see the influence of the whistling oyster on the kind of plot and themes of that?

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:30.360
 Very much.

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:31.360
 Absolutely.

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:32.360
 Yeah.

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:36.920
 I imagine having that guy working as your PR man because that is an unbelievable PR trick

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:40.520
 to claim you got a whistling oyster managed to get half of London to come and see it.

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:41.520
 That's amazing.

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:44.320
 Why they, why, how boring was life?

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:45.320
 Life was hard.

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:46.320
 Yeah.

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:50.400
 But with, I mean, if there was a, this was in Covent Garden, right, which is where we are now.

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:55.920
 If there was 100 meters away, there was a whistling oyster, which you'd read about in a magazine.

00:32:55.920 --> 00:33:00.120
 Are you telling me as a QI researcher that you wouldn't be curious enough to go and see

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:01.120
 it?

00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:02.400
 I do get pretty desperate to get away from you guys.

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:03.720
 I might go and see it.

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:05.440
 I don't, do people pay?

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:06.440
 They didn't pay.

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:07.600
 Only with their time.

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:12.240
 They didn't pay that, but it meant that it got people into his shop.

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:17.600
 And then the oyster, like I said, made a cameo appearance in a pantomime staged at Dory Lane

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:18.600
 in 1860.

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:19.600
 That's incredible.

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:20.600
 Who did he play?

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:21.600
 Doug Lysington.

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:27.200
 He mostly played some whistle and character with a shell.

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:31.360
 It would be really funny, though, to dress the oyster up in a big costume, wouldn't it?

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:33.920
 It would be amazing for a little bindle over his shoulder.

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:34.920
 Yeah.

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:40.480
 In the 1830s, just on paying for attractions, in the 1830s, you could pay a shilling to see

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:41.480
 a vase.

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:42.480
 Good.

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.480
 Could it even whistle?

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:45.480
 I didn't even whistle.

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:47.920
 Maybe if you blew into it the right way.

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:49.960
 It was the Royal Clarence vase.

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:51.960
 It was made for King George IV.

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:54.880
 Took work as three years, which is too long to make it one vase.

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:57.680
 And in fact, it should, you can go and see it.

00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:58.680
 Wow.

00:33:58.680 --> 00:33:59.680
 Didn't even have flowers in it.

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:00.680
 What was on it?

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:05.560
 I don't know. It was made partly of gold and glass and an amul.

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:06.880
 I remember I paid.

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:12.040
 I paid 20 quid to go and see Damien Hurst's skull, which had diamonds on it.

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:13.720
 That's not much worse than that, is it?

00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:14.720
 No, you're right.

00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:15.720
 You're a dupe.

00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:16.720
 Oh.

00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:20.960
 I've got another famous oyster.

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:25.880
 This is from the Sailor's magazine of 1840, which I've not checked how reliable it is

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:26.880
 in general.

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:32.480
 But this is what they say. There's a gentleman from Christchurch in Salisbury who keeps a pet

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:35.720
 oyster of the largest and finest breed.

00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:44.760
 It has proved itself an excellent mouser, having already killed five mice by crushing the

00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:48.680
 heads of such as tempted by it as a meal.

00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:53.360
 They had the temerity to intrude their noses within his bivalvular clutches and then

00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:55.480
 he crushed their heads.

00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:57.040
 So that's not true, is it?

00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:02.120
 What's at the Sailor's newsletter, Sailor's magazine at the Sailor's 1840?

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:04.120
 Yeah, it doesn't sound very true, does it?

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:10.940
 Yeah, I think you have checked it and you've found it to be one thing, terms of truthfulness.

00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:16.080
 New Orleans, there used to be an act, just trying to find things about celebrities and

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:17.080
 oysters.

00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:18.080
 Yeah.

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:20.080
 So there used to be an act in New Orleans.

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:25.040
 This is actually a lady who was Elvis Presley's cousin, she was called Kitty West.

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:31.560
 And she had an act called Evangeline the Oyster Girl in the 1940s which was a striptease

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:35.080
 which began in an enormous and slowly opening oyster shell.

00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:36.080
 Oh, wow.

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:40.080
 So like that, is it butter-chelly painting where she's inside a huge clam?

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:41.080
 Exactly.

00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:42.080
 Yeah.

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:43.080
 Exactly like that.

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:44.080
 But how did she make the shell open?

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:46.960
 Because you have to get professional shuckers to be able to open an oyster shell.

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:49.960
 I think it was a professional shucker by the side.

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:56.960
 That's a lever.

00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:01.180
 I was looking for entertainers like the Oyster that we might have found around Covent Garden.

00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:06.760
 And as you could have seen in 1830s, Spelterini and his living ass.

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:08.920
 And there's a poster of him and he looks incredible.

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:14.720
 So what he did is he had a ladder in his teeth and at the top of a ladder was a donkey.

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:18.000
 And in his two hands, he held 56 pound weights.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.040
 So he was balancing a donkey on the top of a ladder held in his mouth.

00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:23.040
 Wow.

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:26.840
 I'm kind of impressed by the donkey as well, being able to stay at the top of a ladder.

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:28.560
 Yeah, it was pretty chilled out, donkey, yeah.

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:29.560
 Yeah.

00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:30.560
 Yeah.

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:31.560
 He was incredible.

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:35.200
 So apparently there was a liver puddleian guy called Sam Wilde who did the same thing when

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:40.560
 they were knobbing the crowd, which is the name for passing around the hat.

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:41.560
 Of course it is.

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:42.560
 Yeah, sure.

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:43.560
 Yeah, yeah.

00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:46.080
 And they'd say, oh, we've got to have just one more shilling laser gentleman then up goes

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:47.080
 the donkey.

00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:49.120
 That is amazing.

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:51.680
 That's a quick thinking performer who's been cheating on his wife.

00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:56.640
 I was knobbing the crowd with like, which is when we had around the hat, of course.

00:36:56.640 --> 00:37:00.360
 Amazing that you had one guy who's doing that and he was obviously so popular that another

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:02.680
 guy decided I'm going to do that exact same thing.

00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:03.680
 How hard could it be?

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:05.360
 It's like the guy's in Yoda mask, isn't it?

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:07.160
 It's like a much more impressive version of that.

00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:08.160
 Yeah.

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:09.160
 It's like a square.

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:10.160
 You frequently have three or four guys in Yoda masks.

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:11.160
 You do.

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:14.640
 And similarly with them and with this guy, you think they'd just do one little twist,

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:20.480
 maybe have a goat, not a donkey, maybe have a Gandalf mask, not a yoga mask.

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:21.480
 Brinds got talent.

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:22.480
 Would have been amazing back in the old days.

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:23.480
 It really would.

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:26.520
 If today there was a guy in Brinds got talent who had 56 pound weights in either hand and

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:31.120
 a donkey on a ladder in his teeth, he would win for me the final immediately.

00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:35.800
 But really you need to kind of diversify for the later rounds, don't you?

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:39.640
 Because you can't just turn up and do the same thing again.

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:40.640
 Can you?

00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:42.480
 I've never watched it, but I assume they do different things.

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:43.480
 I guess you must.

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:46.520
 The tragedy of Brinds got talent because this guy deserves to win forever.

00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:53.560
 But you could dumb it down so you could start by holding a chair with a cat on it.

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:59.560
 So one thing you mentioned a policeman and whistles and I just I did wonder when about

00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:03.600
 that, what did they use, what do we use before whistles, right?

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:07.760
 And it might it might become a knowledge, but in the design of the police whistle came

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:14.240
 in in like 1883 and it was out of a competition, a guy called Joseph Hudson, but before that

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:16.600
 they had hand rattles, the police.

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:17.600
 Really?

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:18.920
 That's really good.

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:22.680
 Like soccer referees use whistles, but before that they used to just wave hanker chains

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:24.000
 or something.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.000
 Yeah.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.280
 And, but that's he also designed a referee whistle.

00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:29.280
 Really?

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:31.840
 And then he also made something called the Acme Thunderer, which is a pea whistle.

00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:35.600
 Oh, I've got, you've got a, my parents have one in the house, an Acme Thunderer.

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:36.600
 Yeah.

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:37.600
 Really?

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:39.760
 Have they kept you in check?

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:40.760
 Yes.

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:45.640
 No, I was too much of a sunflower for that.

00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:49.600
 It was a wave to hanker chief of me when I was being naughty.

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:54.360
 And you're not supposed to eat oysters in a month with the letter R, are you?

00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:55.360
 That's an old.

00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:56.360
 Yeah.

00:38:56.360 --> 00:39:00.160
 But it seems kind of possibly probably quite true.

00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:04.240
 Certainly in the olden days where shellfish would spoil in the heat because they are months

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:08.720
 and mostly in the, in the summer, but also that usually is a spawning season.

00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:10.880
 So, must the energy goes towards reproduction?

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:15.120
 Yeah, it's because when they go into their spawning seasons in your arm months, then they

00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:17.960
 basically turn completely into gonads.

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:23.000
 They are fully made of testicles and ovaries, so all oyster tissue transforms when they're

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.960
 spawning into reproductive organs is like all of yourself just turning into a bunch of

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:28.960
 testicles.

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:29.960
 That's incredible.

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:33.960
 That's quite, I mean, that would make the dating scene a lot easier, wouldn't it?

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:37.480
 Because you wouldn't know if someone was upset.

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:38.480
 Yeah.

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:39.480
 They turned into a testicle.

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:45.600
 You still want to make sure you're in attractive enough testicle over it, with a good enough sense

00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:46.600
 of humour.

00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:50.400
 That's really, let's get you into an uber shall we?

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:55.200
 Manhandling, you'd testicle into the boot.

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:59.200
 Okay, that's it.

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:00.200
 That's all of our facts.

00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:01.800
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:05.760
 We'll be back again next week with another four facts, and in the meantime, you can catch us

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:08.160
 on our Twitter feeds or you can catch these guys on their Twitter feed.

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:09.160
 So James is on.

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:10.160
 That's James Harkin.

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:11.160
 Andy's on.

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:12.160
 At Andrew Hunter M.

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:13.160
 Ed is.

00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:14.160
 At Fox Tosser.

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:18.880
 The look of pain on your face when you knew you had to say it, but you made that for yourself.

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:19.880
 No, I didn't.

00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:20.880
 My publisher did.

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:22.320
 That's fair enough.

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:27.600
 You can get me on podcast at qi.com and you can listen to all our previous episodes by

00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:33.720
 going to know such things at fish.com, you can go to qi.com/fishevents to get tickets for

00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:34.720
 our tour.

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:38.720
 And also, there's loads of information on that, such thing as a fish site on our book.

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:40.120
 And what's your book called then?

00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:42.080
 Called the Golden Atlas.

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:44.640
 And you can get that in bookshops presumably.

00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:45.640
 Everywhere I've been.

00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:46.640
 Everywhere.

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:47.640
 All over the world.

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:48.640
 It is a beautiful book.

00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:52.440
 You should definitely get it as soon as you've got ours, obviously, or by them at once.

00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:54.040
 And we'll be back again next week.

00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:55.040
 See you then.

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:55.040
 Goodbye.

00:40:55.040 --> 00:41:05.040
 [MUSIC]

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:07.620
