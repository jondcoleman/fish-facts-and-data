00:00:00,00:00:07,So you don't want to go back to sleep?
00:00:07,00:00:20,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Things A Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:20,00:00:23,to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:00:23,00:00:28,"My name is Anna Toshinsky and I'm sitting here with James Arkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and"
00:00:28,00:00:34,"this week we are with Ed Brooke Hitching, our fellow QI Elf, who has just written a new book,"
00:00:34,00:00:35,right?
00:00:35,00:00:41,"Yes, it's called The Golden Atlas, a history of exploration, just filled with that kind"
00:00:41,00:00:43,of quirky QI style facts.
00:00:43,00:00:48,"Yes, it is a really beautiful looking book full of amazing looking kind of maps and little"
00:00:48,00:00:50,factoids about exploration.
00:00:50,00:00:54,"Get it now, go to Ed's Twitter feed or any book show after the show."
00:00:54,00:00:57,"After the show, sorry, get it in, you know, however long it takes to listen to this."
00:00:57,00:01:02,"It's available in any bookshop or online and for now, once again, we're gathered here"
00:01:02,00:01:08,"with our four favourite facts from the last seven days in no particular order, here we go."
00:01:08,00:01:10,"Starting with you, Ed."
00:01:10,00:01:17,So my fact is the most experienced sailor of all Captain Cook's First Voyage was a goat.
00:01:17,00:01:20,"But yes, she previously sailed around the world."
00:01:20,00:01:24,"When you say she was experienced, she didn't do any sailing, presumably, she was just on"
00:01:24,00:01:25,milk provision.
00:01:25,00:01:29,"I don't think she was too, like, nifty with the ropes, if that's what I mean."
00:01:29,00:01:34,"But yeah, she'd survived, like a global, like a circumnavigation, you know, I think she'd"
00:01:34,00:01:36,survived three shipwrecks as well.
00:01:36,00:01:37,Wow.
00:01:37,00:01:38,That's pretty amazing.
00:01:38,00:01:39,All for her milk.
00:01:39,00:01:41,"So she was, yeah, a really impressive."
00:01:41,00:01:42,What was she called?
00:01:42,00:01:45,"Oh, she didn't have a name, but she's known as the well-traveled goat."
00:01:45,00:01:50,"That is the first animal to travel around the world and in fact, wasn't she the first female"
00:01:50,00:01:51,to travel around the world?
00:01:51,00:01:52,"Yes, in the world."
00:01:52,00:01:53,And they didn't even give her a name.
00:01:53,00:01:57,They named her the well-traveled and then they got her species name at the end.
00:01:57,00:01:58,That's wrong with that.
00:01:58,00:01:59,Yeah.
00:01:59,00:02:02,"But they gave her some jewelry, like, when she returned, safe and sound, she went to live"
00:02:02,00:02:09,"in Marlend and they gave her a silver collar, and she was quite a fancy goat."
00:02:09,00:02:12,"And then when she died, Dr. Johnson wrote her epitaph."
00:02:12,00:02:16,Do you think they brought her on because she was so experienced as well as her milk stuff?
00:02:16,00:02:21,"Like, because you could get milk from any goat, but this is a goat that's been on two"
00:02:21,00:02:22,different experts.
00:02:22,00:02:26,"Yeah, she's probably there like a cigarette in her hand, like, no worries at all."
00:02:26,00:02:29,"But I guess, well, she could have been thought of as a lucky goat if she'd survived Chebrax."
00:02:29,00:02:30,Yeah.
00:02:30,00:02:31,Definitely.
00:02:31,00:02:32,So that's something.
00:02:32,00:02:36,Captain Cook actually once did chase a goat across an entire island.
00:02:36,00:02:37,That's true.
00:02:37,00:02:39,Was it a big island?
00:02:39,00:02:40,I don't know.
00:02:40,00:02:42,"It was a stolen goat, though."
00:02:42,00:02:43,That's it.
00:02:43,00:02:46,"So he, Captain Cook was making these voyages around the world, wasn't he?"
00:02:46,00:02:50,"And the first one was scientific and the other two were discovering, you know, botanical"
00:02:50,00:02:55,"things and lamb masses and that frequently things got next by the people he encountered,"
00:02:55,00:02:59,the aboriginals who he was meeting for the first time because there wasn't the same sense
00:02:59,00:03:02,of property rights and ownership and things like that.
00:03:02,00:03:04,"And some things he said, no, we should just let it go."
00:03:04,00:03:05,This doesn't matter.
00:03:05,00:03:09,"And then, but other times, when it was an important thing for the mission, he was really"
00:03:09,00:03:11,a stickler for getting it back.
00:03:11,00:03:15,"And we wanted the goat back because the third voyage, one of the missions was to introduce"
00:03:15,00:03:18,"European livestock, so pairs of European livestock."
00:03:18,00:03:22,"So if you've lost one goat, it's very, very hard to get goat breeding."
00:03:22,00:03:26,"I can't remember if they didn't bring a spare, though, because you'd assume that a couple"
00:03:26,00:03:27,might go.
00:03:27,00:03:29,"I would have brought five or six, I think."
00:03:29,00:03:32,"Yeah, I mean, if we can just stock six ships worth of stuff, then that's fine."
00:03:32,00:03:35,"I think it was quite crowded for space on these ships, Anna."
00:03:35,00:03:36,Fair enough.
00:03:36,00:03:38,You would have been the worst on Noah's Ark.
00:03:38,00:03:39,Why have you only got two of them?
00:03:39,00:03:43,One of these didn't fancy each other.
00:03:43,00:03:48,"Well, a lot of room on the ship would have been taken up with Sour Crout."
00:03:48,00:03:51,"They brought several tons of Sour Crout, because Captain Cook was one of the first to realize"
00:03:51,00:03:58,"that scurvy could be treated with vitamins, and he didn't quite understand why, but he"
00:03:58,00:04:02,"had to convince no one like Sour Crout, so the way that he convinces Cruder to eat it was"
00:04:02,00:04:08,"to serve his officers in a really fancy way, and so the crew would get jealous and think,"
00:04:08,00:04:10,"""Oh, this must be something worth,"" stuff like that."
00:04:10,00:04:12,"Nouvelle Quizzine, Sour Crout."
00:04:12,00:04:13,"Yeah, exactly."
00:04:13,00:04:19,"That's a nice, white tablecloth, just a dumpload of Sour Crout."
00:04:19,00:04:20,That's really clever.
00:04:20,00:04:25,Did you know that one of his expeditions had his ostensible mission and then his secret mission?
00:04:25,00:04:31,"So this is his 1768 expedition, when he was officially going to Tahiti, he was supposed"
00:04:31,00:04:35,to observe the transit of Venus across the face of the sun and do a bunch of other scientific
00:04:35,00:04:36,stuff.
00:04:36,00:04:41,"But the British government told him, ""Do this, but here's a sealed envelope, and when"
00:04:41,00:04:45,"you've done that, you're allowed to open this sealed envelope, and that contains a secret"
00:04:45,00:04:47,"information for what you're actually supposed to do."""
00:04:47,00:04:48,It's like Taskmaster.
00:04:48,00:04:54,It was such an extreme long episode of Taskmaster.
00:04:54,00:04:57,"And yeah, he opened the envelope when he'd done his Tahiti business, and it said, ""Please"
00:04:57,00:04:59,"find the great Southern continent."""
00:04:59,00:05:03,"Everyone was convinced there was a big continent down in the South Pole, and they were right."
00:05:03,00:05:06,"Obviously, but he tried to find it and failed."
00:05:06,00:05:11,"They knew something was there and it was all based on, sort of, like, sightings of little islands,"
00:05:11,00:05:12,maybe ice flows.
00:05:12,00:05:13,Yeah.
00:05:13,00:05:18,"But yeah, on the second voyage, they passed a cook and his men passed within 70 miles of"
00:05:18,00:05:20,Antarctica and didn't find it.
00:05:20,00:05:21,Wow.
00:05:21,00:05:22,That's so frustrating.
00:05:22,00:05:23,How do we know?
00:05:23,00:05:26,Do they leave footprint in the sea?
00:05:26,00:05:27,What of where they went?
00:05:27,00:05:28,Yeah.
00:05:28,00:05:29,"No, they have maps."
00:05:29,00:05:30,"Oh, yeah."
00:05:30,00:05:31,They were riding it all down.
00:05:31,00:05:41,It's full of maps.
00:05:41,00:05:44,"I've been reading about the ship itself, the Endeavour."
00:05:44,00:05:48,"This is a very famous ship, but it was such an unglamorous ship."
00:05:48,00:05:53,"So it was a coal-carrying ship, which is not, you know, very glam."
00:05:53,00:05:54,It wasn't very fast.
00:05:54,00:05:58,It could only go about six or seven knots at nautical miles an hour.
00:05:58,00:06:03,"But nonetheless, it was incredibly hardy because it was designed to carry coal around and"
00:06:03,00:06:05,it was built to last.
00:06:05,00:06:08,So it did all these voyages.
00:06:08,00:06:09,It hit the Great Barrier Reef once.
00:06:09,00:06:13,"He just bumped into the Great Barrier Reef, and it tore a hole in the side of the ship and"
00:06:13,00:06:16,they had to dump six cannon overboard immediately.
00:06:16,00:06:17,So it wouldn't sink.
00:06:17,00:06:18,Probably damaged the coral as well.
00:06:18,00:06:19,"Oh, yeah."
00:06:19,00:06:20,But who cares?
00:06:20,00:06:24,"I mean, like I was just thinking that's effectively a footprint of the sea, isn't it?"
00:06:24,00:06:25,Yes.
00:06:25,00:06:26,That's how we know.
00:06:26,00:06:28,So I didn't mean that about who cares its coral.
00:06:28,00:06:29,I care a lot about the Great Barrier Reef.
00:06:29,00:06:30,Sorry.
00:06:30,00:06:31,I get it.
00:06:31,00:06:35,But scientists spent 200 years trying to find the cannon that he ditched overboard.
00:06:35,00:06:38,And they knew that he'd been around there because they left charts and maps saying where
00:06:38,00:06:39,they'd been.
00:06:39,00:06:45,But no one could actually find the exact cannon until 1969 when they went there with a magnetometer
00:06:45,00:06:49,"looking for the iron of the cannons, testing for magnetism as a barrier reef, yeah."
00:06:49,00:06:50,Very clever.
00:06:50,00:06:54,"Well, because we also recently found quite recently found the Endeavour itself, didn't"
00:06:54,00:06:55,we?
00:06:55,00:07:01,"So the Endeavour was actually two ships in a way, because he used it, 17, you know, 17,"
00:07:01,00:07:04,"17, 16, 17, 17, 17, he used it."
00:07:04,00:07:06,And then it was renamed and repurposed.
00:07:06,00:07:08,It became the Lord's Sandwich.
00:07:08,00:07:13,"And it took place in the Battle of Brooklyn, 1776, so one of the largest ships used there."
00:07:13,00:07:17,And we only found out in the 1990s that that was the same ship.
00:07:17,00:07:20,So I find that really weird that ships are fully repurposed.
00:07:20,00:07:25,"But it was called the Lord's Sandwich, Captain Cook was killed on the Sandwich Islands."
00:07:25,00:07:28,It all comes full circle.
00:07:28,00:07:30,Like the world he travelled around.
00:07:30,00:07:31,Of course.
00:07:31,00:07:34,"Yeah, he was, what happened to him?"
00:07:34,00:07:35,He was baked.
00:07:35,00:07:36,Was he?
00:07:36,00:07:37,"Well, part of the big parcel some more?"
00:07:37,00:07:38,There's a big popular method.
00:07:38,00:07:39,"He was eaten, wasn't there?"
00:07:39,00:07:40,"Yeah, he wasn't eaten."
00:07:40,00:07:44,"He was just baked, so his bones could be removed and treated respectfully."
00:07:44,00:07:45,Okay.
00:07:45,00:07:46,He's a big honour to be baked.
00:07:46,00:07:50,I don't think I'd like to watch the Sandwich Islands version of the Great Sandwich
00:07:50,00:07:51,Island Bake-Off.
00:07:51,00:07:56,"But yeah, he was chopped up into little bits as well, wasn't he?"
00:07:56,00:08:02,So this is when he arrived on Hawaii with his crew and they thought he was a god for a
00:08:02,00:08:03,while.
00:08:03,00:08:06,They thought the whole crew were gods because they weren't in the middle of their big festival
00:08:06,00:08:08,"at the time, worshipping gods."
00:08:08,00:08:11,"And then one of their crew died, which really screwed things up for them because they thought"
00:08:11,00:08:14,they were immortal and then it turned out they weren't immortal.
00:08:14,00:08:17,And so relationships went a bit sour.
00:08:17,00:08:22,And then he sailed away and then rough seas swept him back and they got into fights and
00:08:22,00:08:24,they ended up killing him.
00:08:24,00:08:28,"But the Hawaiians came and delivered all his bones in a sack, didn't they?"
00:08:28,00:08:31,I think one of his compatriots said.
00:08:31,00:08:32,There's another weird link.
00:08:32,00:08:37,"You said that Dr. Johnson wrote the epitaph for the goat, the well-travel goat."
00:08:37,00:08:39,So this was after one of Captain Cook's missions.
00:08:39,00:08:41,He brought back a kangaroo.
00:08:41,00:08:43,They discovered so much new stuff.
00:08:43,00:08:50,"They brought back 30,000 botanical species, 250 new fish and five mammals, including a kangaroo."
00:08:50,00:08:56,And this is a story of a dinner in 1773 where Dr. Johnson was so excited that Captain Cook
00:08:56,00:09:00,"had discovered a kangaroo that he did an impression of it for all the other guests, despite the"
00:09:00,00:09:01,lack.
00:09:01,00:09:02,He'd never seen one.
00:09:02,00:09:04,"Okay, so here's the account."
00:09:04,00:09:07,"He stood erect, put out his hands like feelers."
00:09:07,00:09:08,This is Dr. Johnson.
00:09:08,00:09:12,He put out his hands like feelers and gathering up the tails of his huge brown coat so as to
00:09:12,00:09:17,"resemble the pouch of the animal, made two or three vigorous bounds across the room."
00:09:17,00:09:18,What?
00:09:18,00:09:21,"I mean, considering he's never seen one before, that does sound like a kangaroo."
00:09:21,00:09:22,Yeah.
00:09:22,00:09:23,It's perfect.
00:09:23,00:09:25,I would have been fooled.
00:09:25,00:09:29,Why do we keep calling him Captain Cook when he wasn't a captain?
00:09:29,00:09:30,Ooh.
00:09:30,00:09:32,Why do we call him Captain Cook when he wasn't a captain?
00:09:32,00:09:33,No.
00:09:33,00:09:34,He wasn't a cook either.
00:09:34,00:09:35,"No, man."
00:09:35,00:09:36,He's a fraud.
00:09:36,00:09:38,My assumed tea was a naval captain.
00:09:38,00:09:43,"He was a lieutenant when he was on Endeavour and then when he came back to England, he was"
00:09:43,00:09:46,given the rank of commander.
00:09:46,00:09:52,"And then by 1775, he became a post-captain, which was even better than a captain, but he was"
00:09:52,00:09:53,never actually a captain.
00:09:53,00:09:54,That's so funny.
00:09:54,00:09:55,Yeah.
00:09:55,00:09:57,"So he'd just leapfrog's captain, see?"
00:09:57,00:09:58,Yeah.
00:09:58,00:10:01,"He didn't even need to be a captain, but we still call him Captain Cook."
00:10:01,00:10:02,"It listarates, doesn't it?"
00:10:02,00:10:03,That's the thing.
00:10:03,00:10:04,You're right.
00:10:04,00:10:05,Good to be in Corporal Cook.
00:10:05,00:10:06,Commander Cook.
00:10:06,00:10:07,He was a commander.
00:10:07,00:10:08,Yeah.
00:10:08,00:10:11,"So someone who's a captain of two ships, more than one ship?"
00:10:11,00:10:12,I think you are.
00:10:12,00:10:16,"If you're a captain of one ship, but you also have another ship under your command, you're"
00:10:16,00:10:17,then a commander.
00:10:17,00:10:20,"So it's kind of natural to call someone captain, even though they're a commander."
00:10:20,00:10:21,I think so.
00:10:21,00:10:25,"I think if someone said where's the captain, they'd say, ""Oh, we don't have a captain."""
00:10:25,00:10:26,Yeah.
00:10:26,00:10:27,"Unfortunately, I've come on a misconception."
00:10:27,00:10:32,It's kind of a naval emergency.
00:10:32,00:10:33,Pets on naval pets?
00:10:33,00:10:36,So naval pets were a big deal.
00:10:36,00:10:38,So much so that there was a sailor zoo in the 19th century.
00:10:38,00:10:41,It was set up in Portsmouth in 1893.
00:10:41,00:10:47,"And by 1935, they had lions and various marsupials and birds in aviaries, and with a couple"
00:10:47,00:10:48,of people all taking pets.
00:10:48,00:10:51,So you mean that sailors had pet lions on their boats?
00:10:51,00:10:57,"Well, it seems like it expanded this naval zoo to incorporate things that possibly hadn't"
00:10:57,00:10:58,accompanied the sailors.
00:10:58,00:11:00,"But how did they get there, James?"
00:11:00,00:11:01,How did they...
00:11:01,00:11:02,"Yeah, they couldn't fly in those days."
00:11:02,00:11:04,There was no Euro Tunnel.
00:11:04,00:11:10,"They did find a polar bear, some British sailors, and they just took it onto their ship."
00:11:10,00:11:11,And they took it to Wayland.
00:11:11,00:11:12,Yeah.
00:11:12,00:11:13,They rescued it.
00:11:13,00:11:14,It was a cub when they rescued it.
00:11:14,00:11:17,"And it was on some ice off Greenland, and they made it the ship's mascot and called it"
00:11:17,00:11:18,Barbara.
00:11:18,00:11:23,Do you think she's an apparently funny name for a polar bear?
00:11:23,00:11:31,"All right, there's time for fact number two, and that is my fact."
00:11:31,00:11:38,"My fact this week is that for 150 years, Shakespeare's play The Tragedy of King Lear had a happy"
00:11:38,00:11:39,ending.
00:11:39,00:11:41,Did they still call it The Tragedy of?
00:11:41,00:11:42,"No, they didn't."
00:11:42,00:11:45,"They slightly tweet the title, because they thought it might not work."
00:11:45,00:11:49,"So I read this in the conversation, and I can't believe I didn't know it, but basically"
00:11:49,00:11:52,"people didn't like the fact that King Lear had a sad ending, which spoiler alert it does."
00:11:52,00:11:56,"I mean, really, really sad ending, it's The Tragedy."
00:11:56,00:12:03,"So it was sort of adapted by this writer called Neham Tate in 1681, and he rewrote it, and"
00:12:03,00:12:08,he called it the historical play of King Lear and his three daughters to remove the awkward
00:12:08,00:12:09,word tragedy.
00:12:09,00:12:12,"And yeah, at the end, Cordelia saves King Lear."
00:12:12,00:12:14,He puts her on the throne.
00:12:14,00:12:18,"There's a little love affair between her and remember Edgar and King Lear, who's kind"
00:12:18,00:12:19,of another nice guy.
00:12:19,00:12:23,I don't think there's any flirting with Cordelia and Edgar in the original.
00:12:23,00:12:25,"And yeah, everyone lives happily ever after."
00:12:25,00:12:30,"So in the original, Lear dies, Cordelia dies, everyone dies."
00:12:30,00:12:31,Everyone dies.
00:12:31,00:12:33,Almost everyone has a tiny closing experience.
00:12:33,00:12:34,"We all die, Andy."
00:12:34,00:12:35,"Yeah, this is all right."
00:12:35,00:12:38,"It's a very concertina, then there is a death, that way."
00:12:38,00:12:43,"It's a classic Shakespeare tragedy, isn't it, where within the space is about five minutes,"
00:12:43,00:12:45,about 12 people dropped dead one after death.
00:12:45,00:12:47,It's a very high body count.
00:12:47,00:12:48,Do you think he just gets to the end?
00:12:48,00:12:51,"And he's like, oh, I've only got 100 words left."
00:12:51,00:12:53,I'm just going to have to kill everyone.
00:12:53,00:12:55,"He's not doing an essay, James, I don't think he had a word count."
00:12:55,00:12:58,I've gone way over.
00:12:58,00:12:59,This is the way I think.
00:12:59,00:13:03,The original that Shakespeare borrowed from was not a tragedy.
00:13:03,00:13:07,"I mean, it didn't have this incredibly tragic ending where everyone dies."
00:13:07,00:13:10,"So the rewritten version that you're talking about, and it was kind of a return to the"
00:13:10,00:13:14,"previous edition, there was an ancient version called, there's a thing called Holland Shed's"
00:13:14,00:13:17,"Chronicles, which has a lot of stories of kings and Shakespeare got a lot of plots"
00:13:17,00:13:18,from that.
00:13:18,00:13:24,"But King Lear, Shakespeare's version was in 1606, and it drew heavily on a play from"
00:13:24,00:13:26,1594.
00:13:26,00:13:27,"That's crazy, isn't it?"
00:13:27,00:13:30,The play was for the true Chronicle history of the life and death of King Lear and his
00:13:30,00:13:31,three daughters.
00:13:31,00:13:34,"But that guy's still going to be alive, probably."
00:13:34,00:13:35,He's still alive.
00:13:35,00:13:36,He's still alive.
00:13:36,00:13:38,"I mean, that is, like, remaking die hard."
00:13:38,00:13:39,That was about 30 years ago.
00:13:39,00:13:41,This is about half the time from die hard till now.
00:13:41,00:13:44,"Yeah, but die hard too was much closer than that."
00:13:44,00:13:46,"Yeah, but it wasn't a remake by people."
00:13:46,00:13:47,I don't think he did.
00:13:47,00:13:49,Did the die hard makers sue the makers of die hard too?
00:13:49,00:13:50,I was stealing the hide.
00:13:50,00:13:55,"Actually, what about Mary Poppins, they were about to redo that, aren't they?"
00:13:55,00:13:56,Or maybe they just have?
00:13:56,00:13:57,That's true.
00:13:57,00:13:58,That's controversial.
00:13:58,00:13:59,"And that was about 50 years ago, wasn't it?"
00:13:59,00:14:00,Yeah.
00:14:00,00:14:01,So people are saying that's too soon.
00:14:01,00:14:04,"So maybe this is why he had to kill off all the characters, so that it wasn't too close"
00:14:04,00:14:06,to the original that he could be sued.
00:14:06,00:14:07,Maybe.
00:14:07,00:14:12,"Do you think you can do that, just take any of the show, any other movie and make it exactly"
00:14:12,00:14:15,"the same, but at the end just kill off all the characters?"
00:14:15,00:14:16,Yeah.
00:14:16,00:14:18,What's the good film from early 2000s?
00:14:18,00:14:20,I think we should just rewrite all 10 series of friends.
00:14:20,00:14:21,Last episode.
00:14:21,00:14:22,Everyone dies.
00:14:22,00:14:23,Everyone dies.
00:14:23,00:14:26,Do you know the reason why Nahem Tate changed the ending?
00:14:26,00:14:29,They were all little sunflowers.
00:14:29,00:14:30,"No, what is it?"
00:14:30,00:14:31,What's it called?
00:14:31,00:14:32,Snowflakes.
00:14:32,00:14:33,Snowflakes.
00:14:33,00:14:37,That's what we are in the summer with Snowflakes in the winter.
00:14:37,00:14:38,Exactly.
00:14:38,00:14:39,Snowflakes.
00:14:39,00:14:40,Snowflakes.
00:14:40,00:14:41,Snowflakes.
00:14:41,00:14:42,"Snowflakes, aren't they?"
00:14:42,00:14:49,"Kind of, but I think it's because the players about the king being usurped."
00:14:49,00:14:54,"And when Nahem Tate was writing it was the 1680s, which is Charles II is on the throne."
00:14:54,00:14:57,He's a bit sore about his father being executed and usurped.
00:14:57,00:15:02,So Restoration Theatre was quite careful with various themes like that.
00:15:02,00:15:03,Wow.
00:15:03,00:15:06,And didn't they stop doing King Lear in George III's time?
00:15:06,00:15:07,"Oh, really?"
00:15:07,00:15:10,"Because he was mentally ill, let's put it that way."
00:15:10,00:15:15,But he read King Lear and had a bout of mental illness after having read King Lear.
00:15:15,00:15:16,Really?
00:15:16,00:15:20,And they put him in a straight jacket and tied him down and he was described as agitated
00:15:20,00:15:24,"and confused and he ended up in bed for weeks afterwards, because he'd read King Lear."
00:15:24,00:15:28,And I don't know how the thought that it was to do with him.
00:15:28,00:15:29,Wow.
00:15:29,00:15:30,Maybe it's a dangerous book.
00:15:30,00:15:33,"Samuel Johnson didn't like it, even though he published one of those several times."
00:15:33,00:15:34,"No, Kangaroos in it."
00:15:34,00:15:35,"No, no Kangaroos."
00:15:35,00:15:43,"No, I didn't do an impression of the Mad King as well."
00:15:43,00:15:48,"And no, he read the whole thing with only Kangaroos' character."
00:15:48,00:15:49,I genuinely have a fact about that.
00:15:49,00:15:51,"Oh, my God."
00:15:51,00:15:56,"In 2014, there was an English playwright who staged a version of King Lear called King Lear"
00:15:56,00:16:02,"with sheep, which features one human character and then about nine sheep."
00:16:02,00:16:03,And he's trying to direct a King Lear.
00:16:03,00:16:06,The character in the play is trying to direct King Lear with sheep.
00:16:06,00:16:08,And they disobey him.
00:16:08,00:16:11,And he goes mad and starts acting out the narrative himself.
00:16:11,00:16:15,"And she said, ""I wanted to use the idea of non-cooperative actors to explore the themes"
00:16:15,00:16:18,"of King Lear, because there's a big scene where Cordelia doesn't do anything when she's"
00:16:18,00:16:19,"told to."""
00:16:19,00:16:22,"And she also said, ""It's cheaper than paying actual actors."""
00:16:22,00:16:29,"Okay, I've got a fact about that, which is kind of linked, which is that Neham Tate,"
00:16:29,00:16:36,"as well as doing this play, he also wrote the song, ""While Shepherds watch their flocks."""
00:16:36,00:16:37,Wow.
00:16:37,00:16:40,Which is the earliest English Carol written that we're still singing the original words
00:16:40,00:16:41,of.
00:16:41,00:16:44,And he would have loved this new relation.
00:16:44,00:16:50,"I should just say to finish off the Samuel Johnson thing, for those sheep redirected us,"
00:16:50,00:16:54,"he said that King Lear really troubled him, so it caused him extreme discomfort."
00:16:54,00:16:58,"And even though he published his edition in 1765, he found the death of Cordelia so upsetting"
00:16:58,00:17:00,that he never ever read it again.
00:17:00,00:17:01,He refused to read it again.
00:17:01,00:17:04,"And that his editor was literally like, ""You have to look at these pages to work out"
00:17:04,00:17:05,"what we're going to cut."""
00:17:05,00:17:07,Because he said it was so traumatic.
00:17:07,00:17:08,Wow.
00:17:08,00:17:12,"Really, Victorians found Shakespeare very horrible."
00:17:12,00:17:13,We wrote a lot of them.
00:17:13,00:17:17,"I mean, would it make me think of you talking about like sensitivity to kings being overthrown?"
00:17:17,00:17:20,"Do you know the movie ""Doctor Strange Love?"""
00:17:20,00:17:21,I know it hadn't.
00:17:21,00:17:26,"They filmed an alternate ending, so it ends with a big sort of dog strain of getting out"
00:17:26,00:17:31,"of his wheelchair and miraculously walking, and then the world blows up."
00:17:31,00:17:37,"But there was a filmed custard pie fight in the war, and there are photos of it."
00:17:37,00:17:41,"You can Google it, and you can see Peter says everyone throwing cream pies at each other."
00:17:41,00:17:42,That's amazing.
00:17:42,00:17:43,"Yeah, that sounds great."
00:17:43,00:17:46,"And he effectively went with the Shakespeare ending, didn't he?"
00:17:46,00:17:47,Were everyone dice?
00:17:47,00:17:48,Yeah.
00:17:48,00:17:49,"Oh, yeah."
00:17:49,00:17:50,Really?
00:17:50,00:17:51,Yeah.
00:17:51,00:17:52,"I did a little work on ""Mayhem Tate."""
00:17:52,00:17:53,"Oh, yeah."
00:17:53,00:17:55,"You know, his father was called ""Faithful Teet."""
00:17:55,00:17:56,Wow.
00:17:56,00:17:57,Wow.
00:17:57,00:18:02,"I mean, that's a strong name, isn't it?"
00:18:02,00:18:03,Yeah.
00:18:03,00:18:04,Faithful Teet.
00:18:04,00:18:07,That's also the name of one of the goats that went around the world.
00:18:07,00:18:08,Yeah.
00:18:08,00:18:10,And then I guess he changed his name.
00:18:10,00:18:13,"He didn't want to be called ""Teet"" anymore, so ""Mayhem Tate Master"" changed it."
00:18:13,00:18:14,But he was a big deal.
00:18:14,00:18:15,He was poet laureate.
00:18:15,00:18:16,Was it?
00:18:16,00:18:18,"No, I mean, ""Teet"" was, as well, I think."
00:18:18,00:18:19,"Oh, sorry."
00:18:19,00:18:20,"That's what I mean, ""Mayhem Tate"" was."
00:18:20,00:18:21,Yeah.
00:18:21,00:18:22,"""Washepers Watched Their Flogs By Night."""
00:18:22,00:18:27,"For the next century, it was the only carol that was allowed in Church of England,"
00:18:27,00:18:28,ceremonies or services.
00:18:28,00:18:29,Really?
00:18:29,00:18:30,They hated carols.
00:18:30,00:18:32,But this was just religious enough to kind of pass master.
00:18:32,00:18:36,"But at Christmas, would you do the thing where you sing eight carols, but you just had"
00:18:36,00:18:38,"to sing ""Washepers Watched Their Flogs By Night."""
00:18:38,00:18:39,Eight times.
00:18:39,00:18:42,"Yeah, like a carol service will be just the same thing all the time."
00:18:42,00:18:48,"And if you'll now turn your pages to carol number five, ""Washepers Watched."""
00:18:48,00:18:52,"And the only change that's been made over the last 300 years, according to Wikipedia,"
00:18:52,00:18:53,this is.
00:18:53,00:18:58,"And the only change that's been made has been changing the word from wilds to wild, so"
00:18:58,00:19:00,from wilds to shepherds.
00:19:00,00:19:03,"And the other changes where they changed it to ""Washepers Watched Their Socks."""
00:19:03,00:19:06,"That was the other one of cars, but."
00:19:06,00:19:09,That was the original.
00:19:09,00:19:12,Tite de San Dronecus was also changed.
00:19:12,00:19:18,"In Tite de San Dronecus in 1850, there's this big rape scene where a woman has a tongue"
00:19:18,00:19:22,cut out and her hands cut off and it's to prevent her spilling the names of her attackers.
00:19:22,00:19:24,And that was all completely edited.
00:19:24,00:19:29,"There was a version of Hamla where a failure dies from accidental drowning, because it was"
00:19:29,00:19:31,thought to be too upsetting that it was suicide.
00:19:31,00:19:37,"But I think people are often saying that we're a bit too pathetic now, but too snowflakey."
00:19:37,00:19:43,"It was Baudler who did the accidental drowning, wasn't it, from whom we get Baudler right?"
00:19:43,00:19:47,"It's a really cool fan theory about him, it's just a theory, actually, I don't know why you say it."
00:19:47,00:19:48,About Baudler?
00:19:48,00:19:52,"Yeah, so he published this thing called ""The Family Shakespeare,"" because he was saying"
00:19:52,00:19:54,that all families can read together.
00:19:54,00:19:57,"So if you're reading out to your children, you don't want to read a rape scene where"
00:19:57,00:20:03,"some of us get the tongue cut out and hands cut off, which is kind of reasonable."
00:20:03,00:20:07,"So there's also lots of naughty stuff, you know, there are characters who are prostitutes"
00:20:07,00:20:08,and all that had to go.
00:20:08,00:20:12,"But there's a theory that it wasn't the Reverend Thomas Baudler who did most of the cutting,"
00:20:12,00:20:14,it was his sister.
00:20:14,00:20:17,She did most of the cutting and she produced the first version.
00:20:17,00:20:22,But Baudler claimed to have written it so that his sister didn't have to publicly admit
00:20:22,00:20:24,that she had understood the root bits.
00:20:24,00:20:28,"That's so funny, maybe."
00:20:28,00:20:29,Wow.
00:20:29,00:20:35,"When he was 40, just over 40, Baudler married a lady called Elizabeth Frevenon and it was"
00:20:35,00:20:39,such a bad marriage that they split up quite quickly and nobody in the family was ever
00:20:39,00:20:42,allowed to mention Elizabeth's name ever again.
00:20:42,00:20:45,So his whole life was Baudlerized basically.
00:20:45,00:20:46,Wow.
00:20:46,00:20:47,That's awesome.
00:20:47,00:20:48,That's great.
00:20:48,00:20:50,"God, he was very free and easy with editing."
00:20:50,00:20:51,"Basically, isn't he?"
00:20:51,00:20:55,The editing is live out of the life.
00:20:55,00:20:59,Queen Victoria said she'd never had the courage to see the Mary Wives of Windsor.
00:20:59,00:21:02,She wrote to her daughter who was a Shakespeare fan.
00:21:02,00:21:05,She never had the courage to see it because she'd always been told how very cool it was.
00:21:05,00:21:07,And it's very boring.
00:21:07,00:21:09,I've never read or seen that one.
00:21:09,00:21:10,There's a thing.
00:21:10,00:21:13,"People say that he wrote it in nine days and I'll be honest, I'm staggered."
00:21:13,00:21:16,It took him that long to write that way.
00:21:16,00:21:18,Isn't the least good I've ever read.
00:21:18,00:21:22,Maybe she just thought it was really dull but didn't want to upset Shakespeare fans.
00:21:22,00:21:24,I said I've heard it's too rude.
00:21:24,00:21:27,"Yeah, she didn't she found him but too close for her taste generally."
00:21:27,00:21:31,There have been 24 opera's based on Romeo and Juliet.
00:21:31,00:21:38,"The earliest is called Romeo and Juliet, which is quite cool and that has a happy ending."
00:21:38,00:21:43,"And also if you go on fanfic.com and look for some fanfiction on Romeo and Juliet, there"
00:21:43,00:21:47,is a thing called Romeo and Juliet happy ending.
00:21:47,00:21:52,And at the end it's just it's like a final scene of Romeo and Juliet and it says days become
00:21:52,00:21:57,days and years become years and one day Freya Lawrence gets a letter saying that Juliet had
00:21:57,00:22:01,died in a sleep and later that year he gets the same letter from the Montague's that Romeo
00:22:01,00:22:02,has died in his sleep.
00:22:02,00:22:04,That's a nice ending isn't it?
00:22:04,00:22:08,But he's substantially older than both of those characters isn't it?
00:22:08,00:22:10,So they've still died quite young.
00:22:10,00:22:11,Yeah.
00:22:11,00:22:17,"I just got one more thing about modern day, about modern day kind of censorship."
00:22:17,00:22:18,And prudishness.
00:22:18,00:22:23,So did you see the Cambridge University put trigger warnings on lots of it Shakespeare lectures?
00:22:23,00:22:26,And people got really exercised about this.
00:22:26,00:22:27,Really?
00:22:27,00:22:28,Yeah.
00:22:28,00:22:30,Just for like some flowers who couldn't really do.
00:22:30,00:22:31,Some flowers.
00:22:31,00:22:32,Yeah.
00:22:32,00:22:34,So I think this is why this conversation article came out.
00:22:34,00:22:38,"It was saying don't worry people have always done this, but if you take English literature"
00:22:38,00:22:43,"at Cambridge, then if you go to a lecture for instance on Titus Andronicus or in fact"
00:22:43,00:22:47,"on Euripides the Back Eye, that's another one that has them, then you get a little one"
00:22:47,00:22:51,"of those exclamation marks in a red triangle at the end of the lecture, which is to say this"
00:22:51,00:22:53,might contain some traumatic themes.
00:22:53,00:22:54,Oh my god.
00:22:54,00:22:55,Yeah.
00:22:55,00:23:00,If you have been troubled by any of the themes in Titus Andronicus.
00:23:00,00:23:02,You've had a rough old life actually.
00:23:02,00:23:03,Yeah.
00:23:03,00:23:04,That is tough.
00:23:04,00:23:08,If your sons have been baked in a pie.
00:23:08,00:23:15,"Okay, let's move on to fact number three."
00:23:15,00:23:17,That is Andy's fact.
00:23:17,00:23:21,My fact is that some advertisers have started putting single pixels on mobile phones ads
00:23:21,00:23:26,"so you think it's dust, try to wipe it off and accidentally click on the advert."
00:23:26,00:23:27,It is.
00:23:27,00:23:28,It's genius.
00:23:28,00:23:29,That is so good.
00:23:29,00:23:30,Yeah.
00:23:30,00:23:31,So I've only found one advertiser that's done this.
00:23:31,00:23:35,"There's a great article on Medium called 52 Things I Learned This Yeah, and this is one"
00:23:35,00:23:36,of the 52 things.
00:23:36,00:23:39,"But it doesn't really work, right?"
00:23:39,00:23:40,I read another article I think it was.
00:23:40,00:23:45,"I'm not sure where I read this, but basically they said if you get paid for every time someone"
00:23:45,00:23:50,"taps on it, then it works, but if you're trying to get actual sales, then it pisses people"
00:23:50,00:23:53,off so much that people end up not buying stuff.
00:23:53,00:23:58,I guess they must be thinking the product is so good that someone will end up buying it.
00:23:58,00:23:59,And what was the product?
00:23:59,00:24:01,"Oh, I can't remember, I'm afraid."
00:24:01,00:24:03,I do know another one who's done a really similar thing.
00:24:03,00:24:09,There's a Chinese trainer manufacturer and they've put a thing that looks like a hair across
00:24:09,00:24:14,their advert and you swipe to get rid of the hair and you go straight to their website.
00:24:14,00:24:15,Yeah.
00:24:15,00:24:17,"I got banned from Instagram, didn't I?"
00:24:17,00:24:22,"Apparently, it violated Instagram's policies and was removed and they Instagram shut down"
00:24:22,00:24:23,the entire brand's account.
00:24:23,00:24:24,Wow.
00:24:24,00:24:25,Because of that.
00:24:25,00:24:26,Yeah.
00:24:26,00:24:28,I can't believe it's not counterproductive.
00:24:28,00:24:29,I like you say.
00:24:29,00:24:30,It's just so irritating.
00:24:30,00:24:36,There was a study a few years ago that found that 50% of ad clicks on phones are accidental.
00:24:36,00:24:37,I'm surprised.
00:24:37,00:24:38,I'm surprised.
00:24:38,00:24:39,I'm surprised it's not low.
00:24:39,00:24:41,I don't think I've ever intentionally clicked on one.
00:24:41,00:24:46,"What phone is so smashed up that if there was something that looks a bit like a hair, you"
00:24:46,00:24:47,would never see it.
00:24:47,00:24:48,"No, absolutely not."
00:24:48,00:24:50,This bit would not work on me at all.
00:24:50,00:24:53,"The thing it reminded me of is, and I was desperately looking for like a source for it,"
00:24:53,00:24:57,but it's something my American grandmother told me and I've heard it mentioned on an American
00:24:57,00:25:01,podcast as well that in the old days when you were making a telephone call and you call
00:25:01,00:25:05,"into the exchange, you could choose which company would carry your call, so which one"
00:25:05,00:25:06,"would get your money, right?"
00:25:06,00:25:07,Really?
00:25:07,00:25:08,Wow.
00:25:08,00:25:13,"The most common answer was, you know, I don't care whatever, whichever one you choose."
00:25:13,00:25:18,"And so people started phone companies called, I don't care, it doesn't matter whatever you"
00:25:18,00:25:19,want.
00:25:19,00:25:21,And they'd rake in this sort of extreme.
00:25:21,00:25:22,Incredible.
00:25:22,00:25:23,"Yeah, it's genius."
00:25:23,00:25:27,"Do you know on the internet, if you click on a naughty site, you might get a whole load"
00:25:27,00:25:28,"of pop-ups, right?"
00:25:28,00:25:29,All right.
00:25:29,00:25:30,Lots of pop-up things.
00:25:30,00:25:31,"Oh, you do know that."
00:25:31,00:25:32,The one.
00:25:32,00:25:33,I'm afraid about it.
00:25:33,00:25:35,"If people with pornographers digest it, yeah."
00:25:35,00:25:40,"They're called ""Pornados"" or ""PonStombs""."
00:25:40,00:25:46,"This is a phrase coined by John C. Dvořák, who is the nephew of the guy who invented the"
00:25:46,00:25:51,"Dvořák Keyboard, which is like a Quarty Keyboard, but it's supposed to be slightly better"
00:25:51,00:25:52,than the Quarty Keyboard.
00:25:52,00:25:57,"That's a step down, isn't it, in far the sun, invention in terms?"
00:25:57,00:25:58,Yeah.
00:25:58,00:26:05,"Well, Dvořák, he writes a lot about computers and he said that the recent Apple's Macintosh"
00:26:05,00:26:09,computer would not be successful is because it uses a pointing device called a mouse.
00:26:09,00:26:13,And there is no evidence that people want to use these things.
00:26:13,00:26:15,And then he wrote about Steve Jobs.
00:26:15,00:26:20,"Maybe when the smoke clears, we will have heard the last of Steve Jobs as guru, CEO, visionary."
00:26:20,00:26:25,"He'll go the way of the pet rock, electric carving knives, silly putty, tiny Tim and the"
00:26:25,00:26:27,three-tone paint job.
00:26:27,00:26:29,That's not really rough on tiny Tim.
00:26:29,00:26:30,Yeah.
00:26:30,00:26:36,A load of African products and then one of the most heart-rending characters on a literature.
00:26:36,00:26:37,So big.
00:26:37,00:26:40,Squashed up next to silly putty.
00:26:40,00:26:44,"I can only imagine maybe tiny Tim as something else in America, right?"
00:26:44,00:26:45,I guess so.
00:26:45,00:26:46,Probably like a failed product or something.
00:26:46,00:26:52,"But like, you know, it'll go the way of C. Monkeys, nasal hair trimmers and Jude the Obscure."
00:26:52,00:26:54,That's a weird spoon.
00:26:54,00:27:00,Do you know why pop-up ads were originally conceived?
00:27:00,00:27:01,No.
00:27:01,00:27:06,It was because advertisers didn't want to be associated with dodgy website content.
00:27:06,00:27:09,"So it's kind of the opposite of problems that websites have now, where sometimes dodgy"
00:27:09,00:27:11,adverts pop-up on them.
00:27:11,00:27:15,So they were invented by a guy called Mr. Zuckerman in the 1990s.
00:27:15,00:27:19,And it was because a car company got upset because it bought a banner advert on a page that
00:27:19,00:27:26,"happened to be about anal sex, which they thought wasn't on brand for their car company."
00:27:26,00:27:28,It's unlikely to be on brand for any car company.
00:27:28,00:27:29,Not exactly.
00:27:29,00:27:31,There's so little overlap there.
00:27:31,00:27:35,And so he made pop-up ads to kind of distinguish them from each other.
00:27:35,00:27:38,And he says that he was wrong with sales.
00:27:38,00:27:41,It's just a kind of sex.
00:27:41,00:27:42,I know.
00:27:42,00:27:47,It's the way you say a page that happened to be about it.
00:27:47,00:27:50,"By chance, it was an anal sex theme page."
00:27:50,00:27:51,They exist.
00:27:51,00:27:52,I suppose so.
00:27:52,00:27:53,They're out there.
00:27:53,00:27:54,Hang on.
00:27:54,00:27:57,The car adverts were popping up on this themed page.
00:27:57,00:27:58,Yeah.
00:27:58,00:28:00,It was all sorts of things popping up.
00:28:00,00:28:03,They weren't up for it.
00:28:03,00:28:06,"So he designed this pop-up thing, which is supposed to say, look, this pop-up has nothing"
00:28:06,00:28:08,to do with the content of this web page.
00:28:08,00:28:10,But he's really apologised for it now.
00:28:10,00:28:13,"He says he feels terribly guilty, because he knows that pop-ups are the most annoying thing"
00:28:13,00:28:14,on the internet.
00:28:14,00:28:16,But his intentions were good.
00:28:16,00:28:19,He didn't want cars to be associated with sexual positions.
00:28:19,00:28:23,So other stupid creative ways of advertising?
00:28:23,00:28:26,"Domino's this year, advertised in potholes."
00:28:26,00:28:31,So this is the thing where they've now got a sideline in fixing potholes on roads across
00:28:31,00:28:32,America.
00:28:32,00:28:35,And you can actually request that they come and fix your pothole if you're in America.
00:28:35,00:28:37,And I think it's an advertising campaign.
00:28:37,00:28:39,"Otherwise, they're just really good guys."
00:28:39,00:28:42,But it's called paving for pizza.
00:28:42,00:28:47,"And they partner with various local administrations and say, hey, have you got any potholes that need"
00:28:47,00:28:48,doing?
00:28:48,00:28:52,And they send out their pizza delivery guys who do a sideline in kind of tarmac filling.
00:28:52,00:28:53,And then they fill in the potholes.
00:28:53,00:28:56,And then they fill in the pothole with little Domino's pizza logo.
00:28:56,00:28:57,I'm sorry.
00:28:57,00:29:00,It's not very long lasting at all.
00:29:00,00:29:01,Wow.
00:29:01,00:29:02,"That's quite good, isn't it?"
00:29:02,00:29:03,Yeah.
00:29:03,00:29:04,That's a good idea.
00:29:04,00:29:05,So they get their logo on the road.
00:29:05,00:29:07,But everyone gets flat roads.
00:29:07,00:29:08,So everyone's a winner.
00:29:08,00:29:09,Wow.
00:29:09,00:29:11,Apart from the other pizza manufacturers.
00:29:11,00:29:12,Yeah.
00:29:12,00:29:15,Papa John is furious.
00:29:15,00:29:17,The justification was that potholes damaged pizzas.
00:29:17,00:29:21,"So they're actually saving the pizzas because on the way, they'll get bumped up and down."
00:29:21,00:29:23,They actually put a GoPro inside a pizza box.
00:29:23,00:29:30,And how people watch the traumatic journey they have to go through to make it to their destination.
00:29:30,00:29:31,Wow.
00:29:31,00:29:32,Yeah.
00:29:32,00:29:35,OKFC advertises on fire hydrants.
00:29:35,00:29:36,They do this.
00:29:36,00:29:41,"I think a couple of years ago, they'll pay people to let them fix their fire hydrants if they're"
00:29:41,00:29:42,broken.
00:29:42,00:29:43,They do this in Indianapolis.
00:29:43,00:29:46,"So they paid, I think, $5,000 to say, can we fix your fire hydrant?"
00:29:46,00:29:48,"And the town was like, yeah, great."
00:29:48,00:29:50,And then they sort of put some KFC advertising on top of it.
00:29:50,00:29:54,But they do also fill up the fire hydrant with chicken.
00:29:54,00:29:58,But then all the fire smelled delicious.
00:29:58,00:30:04,You don't mind burning to a crisp with a delicious smell of KFC all around you.
00:30:04,00:30:11,"OK, onto our final fact of the week."
00:30:11,00:30:13,And that is James' Facts.
00:30:13,00:30:18,"OK, my fact this week is that one of the most popular celebrities in London in 1860,"
00:30:18,00:30:22,was an oyster who could whistle.
00:30:22,00:30:25,One of the most popular is so exciting.
00:30:25,00:30:26,"Also, who could whistle?"
00:30:26,00:30:27,Not that good.
00:30:27,00:30:28,It was a person.
00:30:28,00:30:31,"Well, once you whistle, you get a person heard, I think."
00:30:31,00:30:32,I think so.
00:30:32,00:30:38,"It didn't have a name, a bit like that goat, actually, yeah, thinking about it."
00:30:38,00:30:41,"But yeah, so, I mean, what is the most popular?"
00:30:41,00:30:44,I'm saying it's the most popular because a lot of people want to see it.
00:30:44,00:30:45,Yeah.
00:30:45,00:30:46,It was in Panto.
00:30:46,00:30:50,That's quite popular.
00:30:50,00:30:55,"But this is a guy called George Perks, P-E-A-R-K-E-S."
00:30:55,00:31:00,And he was an Oysterman and a dealer in Spruce Ginger Beer and British wines.
00:31:00,00:31:02,So he's a wine seller and an Oyster seller.
00:31:02,00:31:03,And he was sleeping in his house.
00:31:03,00:31:07,And he was kept awake every night by this whistle.
00:31:07,00:31:08,He was.
00:31:08,00:31:09,He really was.
00:31:09,00:31:10,He really was.
00:31:10,00:31:15,And so he thought that it was a policeman who was walking past every day whistling.
00:31:15,00:31:19,"So anyway, so the whistling got louder and louder and then eventually he'd buy he was"
00:31:19,00:31:25,"being burgled, he said, presumably by a whistling burglar."
00:31:25,00:31:28,"I don't know why I burglar would whistle, but yeah, he did that."
00:31:28,00:31:31,And eventually he went downstairs with a pistol to get this burglar.
00:31:31,00:31:35,And he found out that the source of the sound was one of his oysters.
00:31:35,00:31:38,And it seems that what might have happened is that the oyster had a little hole in it.
00:31:38,00:31:42,"And whenever it was filtering food, so moving the water backwards and forwards, it was making"
00:31:42,00:31:43,the whistling sound.
00:31:43,00:31:44,Right.
00:31:44,00:31:49,"And as soon as this became well known, it was mentioned in punch and a few other things."
00:31:49,00:31:53,Suddenly everyone came round and wanted to see this oyster that could whistle.
00:31:53,00:31:58,And even William Makepeace Thackery went to see it and wrote about it.
00:31:58,00:32:02,And he said that he was there when an American gentleman declared that the oyster could
00:32:02,00:32:08,not hold a candle to one he knew of in Massachusetts that could whistle Yankee Doodle from beginning
00:32:08,00:32:09,to end.
00:32:09,00:32:10,"No, he could."
00:32:10,00:32:11,I don't think that one's dreaming.
00:32:11,00:32:16,But there is definitely was this oyster in 1860 and it was famous and it was in London and
00:32:16,00:32:17,it could whistle.
00:32:17,00:32:18,That's amazing.
00:32:18,00:32:19,It's mad.
00:32:19,00:32:20,"Sorry, I've been reading a book by Thackray."
00:32:20,00:32:25,So the idea of this literary hero going to see the whistling oyster on his day off is incredible.
00:32:25,00:32:29,Can you see the influence of the whistling oyster on the kind of plot and themes of that?
00:32:29,00:32:30,Very much.
00:32:30,00:32:31,Absolutely.
00:32:31,00:32:32,Yeah.
00:32:32,00:32:36,I imagine having that guy working as your PR man because that is an unbelievable PR trick
00:32:36,00:32:40,to claim you got a whistling oyster managed to get half of London to come and see it.
00:32:40,00:32:41,That's amazing.
00:32:41,00:32:44,"Why they, why, how boring was life?"
00:32:44,00:32:45,Life was hard.
00:32:45,00:32:46,Yeah.
00:32:46,00:32:50,"But with, I mean, if there was a, this was in Covent Garden, right, which is where we are now."
00:32:50,00:32:55,"If there was 100 meters away, there was a whistling oyster, which you'd read about in a magazine."
00:32:55,00:33:00,Are you telling me as a QI researcher that you wouldn't be curious enough to go and see
00:33:00,00:33:01,it?
00:33:01,00:33:02,I do get pretty desperate to get away from you guys.
00:33:02,00:33:03,I might go and see it.
00:33:03,00:33:05,"I don't, do people pay?"
00:33:05,00:33:06,They didn't pay.
00:33:06,00:33:07,Only with their time.
00:33:07,00:33:12,"They didn't pay that, but it meant that it got people into his shop."
00:33:12,00:33:17,"And then the oyster, like I said, made a cameo appearance in a pantomime staged at Dory Lane"
00:33:17,00:33:18,in 1860.
00:33:18,00:33:19,That's incredible.
00:33:19,00:33:20,Who did he play?
00:33:20,00:33:21,Doug Lysington.
00:33:21,00:33:27,He mostly played some whistle and character with a shell.
00:33:27,00:33:31,"It would be really funny, though, to dress the oyster up in a big costume, wouldn't it?"
00:33:31,00:33:33,It would be amazing for a little bindle over his shoulder.
00:33:33,00:33:34,Yeah.
00:33:34,00:33:40,"In the 1830s, just on paying for attractions, in the 1830s, you could pay a shilling to see"
00:33:40,00:33:41,a vase.
00:33:41,00:33:42,Good.
00:33:42,00:33:44,Could it even whistle?
00:33:44,00:33:45,I didn't even whistle.
00:33:45,00:33:47,Maybe if you blew into it the right way.
00:33:47,00:33:49,It was the Royal Clarence vase.
00:33:49,00:33:51,It was made for King George IV.
00:33:51,00:33:54,"Took work as three years, which is too long to make it one vase."
00:33:54,00:33:57,"And in fact, it should, you can go and see it."
00:33:57,00:33:58,Wow.
00:33:58,00:33:59,Didn't even have flowers in it.
00:33:59,00:34:00,What was on it?
00:34:00,00:34:05,I don't know. It was made partly of gold and glass and an amul.
00:34:05,00:34:06,I remember I paid.
00:34:06,00:34:12,"I paid 20 quid to go and see Damien Hurst's skull, which had diamonds on it."
00:34:12,00:34:13,"That's not much worse than that, is it?"
00:34:13,00:34:14,"No, you're right."
00:34:14,00:34:15,You're a dupe.
00:34:15,00:34:16,Oh.
00:34:16,00:34:20,I've got another famous oyster.
00:34:20,00:34:25,"This is from the Sailor's magazine of 1840, which I've not checked how reliable it is"
00:34:25,00:34:26,in general.
00:34:26,00:34:32,But this is what they say. There's a gentleman from Christchurch in Salisbury who keeps a pet
00:34:32,00:34:35,oyster of the largest and finest breed.
00:34:35,00:34:44,"It has proved itself an excellent mouser, having already killed five mice by crushing the"
00:34:44,00:34:48,heads of such as tempted by it as a meal.
00:34:48,00:34:53,They had the temerity to intrude their noses within his bivalvular clutches and then
00:34:53,00:34:55,he crushed their heads.
00:34:55,00:34:57,"So that's not true, is it?"
00:34:57,00:35:02,"What's at the Sailor's newsletter, Sailor's magazine at the Sailor's 1840?"
00:35:02,00:35:04,"Yeah, it doesn't sound very true, does it?"
00:35:04,00:35:10,"Yeah, I think you have checked it and you've found it to be one thing, terms of truthfulness."
00:35:10,00:35:16,"New Orleans, there used to be an act, just trying to find things about celebrities and"
00:35:16,00:35:17,oysters.
00:35:17,00:35:18,Yeah.
00:35:18,00:35:20,So there used to be an act in New Orleans.
00:35:20,00:35:25,"This is actually a lady who was Elvis Presley's cousin, she was called Kitty West."
00:35:25,00:35:31,And she had an act called Evangeline the Oyster Girl in the 1940s which was a striptease
00:35:31,00:35:35,which began in an enormous and slowly opening oyster shell.
00:35:35,00:35:36,"Oh, wow."
00:35:36,00:35:40,"So like that, is it butter-chelly painting where she's inside a huge clam?"
00:35:40,00:35:41,Exactly.
00:35:41,00:35:42,Yeah.
00:35:42,00:35:43,Exactly like that.
00:35:43,00:35:44,But how did she make the shell open?
00:35:44,00:35:46,Because you have to get professional shuckers to be able to open an oyster shell.
00:35:46,00:35:49,I think it was a professional shucker by the side.
00:35:49,00:35:56,That's a lever.
00:35:56,00:36:01,I was looking for entertainers like the Oyster that we might have found around Covent Garden.
00:36:01,00:36:06,"And as you could have seen in 1830s, Spelterini and his living ass."
00:36:06,00:36:08,And there's a poster of him and he looks incredible.
00:36:08,00:36:14,So what he did is he had a ladder in his teeth and at the top of a ladder was a donkey.
00:36:14,00:36:18,"And in his two hands, he held 56 pound weights."
00:36:18,00:36:22,So he was balancing a donkey on the top of a ladder held in his mouth.
00:36:22,00:36:23,Wow.
00:36:23,00:36:26,"I'm kind of impressed by the donkey as well, being able to stay at the top of a ladder."
00:36:26,00:36:28,"Yeah, it was pretty chilled out, donkey, yeah."
00:36:28,00:36:29,Yeah.
00:36:29,00:36:30,Yeah.
00:36:30,00:36:31,He was incredible.
00:36:31,00:36:35,So apparently there was a liver puddleian guy called Sam Wilde who did the same thing when
00:36:35,00:36:40,"they were knobbing the crowd, which is the name for passing around the hat."
00:36:40,00:36:41,Of course it is.
00:36:41,00:36:42,"Yeah, sure."
00:36:42,00:36:43,"Yeah, yeah."
00:36:43,00:36:46,"And they'd say, oh, we've got to have just one more shilling laser gentleman then up goes"
00:36:46,00:36:47,the donkey.
00:36:47,00:36:49,That is amazing.
00:36:49,00:36:51,That's a quick thinking performer who's been cheating on his wife.
00:36:51,00:36:56,"I was knobbing the crowd with like, which is when we had around the hat, of course."
00:36:56,00:37:00,Amazing that you had one guy who's doing that and he was obviously so popular that another
00:37:00,00:37:02,guy decided I'm going to do that exact same thing.
00:37:02,00:37:03,How hard could it be?
00:37:03,00:37:05,"It's like the guy's in Yoda mask, isn't it?"
00:37:05,00:37:07,It's like a much more impressive version of that.
00:37:07,00:37:08,Yeah.
00:37:08,00:37:09,It's like a square.
00:37:09,00:37:10,You frequently have three or four guys in Yoda masks.
00:37:10,00:37:11,You do.
00:37:11,00:37:14,"And similarly with them and with this guy, you think they'd just do one little twist,"
00:37:14,00:37:20,"maybe have a goat, not a donkey, maybe have a Gandalf mask, not a yoga mask."
00:37:20,00:37:21,Brinds got talent.
00:37:21,00:37:22,Would have been amazing back in the old days.
00:37:22,00:37:23,It really would.
00:37:23,00:37:26,If today there was a guy in Brinds got talent who had 56 pound weights in either hand and
00:37:26,00:37:31,"a donkey on a ladder in his teeth, he would win for me the final immediately."
00:37:31,00:37:35,"But really you need to kind of diversify for the later rounds, don't you?"
00:37:35,00:37:39,Because you can't just turn up and do the same thing again.
00:37:39,00:37:40,Can you?
00:37:40,00:37:42,"I've never watched it, but I assume they do different things."
00:37:42,00:37:43,I guess you must.
00:37:43,00:37:46,The tragedy of Brinds got talent because this guy deserves to win forever.
00:37:46,00:37:53,But you could dumb it down so you could start by holding a chair with a cat on it.
00:37:53,00:37:59,So one thing you mentioned a policeman and whistles and I just I did wonder when about
00:37:59,00:38:03,"that, what did they use, what do we use before whistles, right?"
00:38:03,00:38:07,"And it might it might become a knowledge, but in the design of the police whistle came"
00:38:07,00:38:14,"in in like 1883 and it was out of a competition, a guy called Joseph Hudson, but before that"
00:38:14,00:38:16,"they had hand rattles, the police."
00:38:16,00:38:17,Really?
00:38:17,00:38:18,That's really good.
00:38:18,00:38:22,"Like soccer referees use whistles, but before that they used to just wave hanker chains"
00:38:22,00:38:24,or something.
00:38:24,00:38:25,Yeah.
00:38:25,00:38:28,"And, but that's he also designed a referee whistle."
00:38:28,00:38:29,Really?
00:38:29,00:38:31,"And then he also made something called the Acme Thunderer, which is a pea whistle."
00:38:31,00:38:35,"Oh, I've got, you've got a, my parents have one in the house, an Acme Thunderer."
00:38:35,00:38:36,Yeah.
00:38:36,00:38:37,Really?
00:38:37,00:38:39,Have they kept you in check?
00:38:39,00:38:40,Yes.
00:38:40,00:38:45,"No, I was too much of a sunflower for that."
00:38:45,00:38:49,It was a wave to hanker chief of me when I was being naughty.
00:38:49,00:38:54,"And you're not supposed to eat oysters in a month with the letter R, are you?"
00:38:54,00:38:55,That's an old.
00:38:55,00:38:56,Yeah.
00:38:56,00:39:00,But it seems kind of possibly probably quite true.
00:39:00,00:39:04,Certainly in the olden days where shellfish would spoil in the heat because they are months
00:39:04,00:39:08,"and mostly in the, in the summer, but also that usually is a spawning season."
00:39:08,00:39:10,"So, must the energy goes towards reproduction?"
00:39:10,00:39:15,"Yeah, it's because when they go into their spawning seasons in your arm months, then they"
00:39:15,00:39:17,basically turn completely into gonads.
00:39:17,00:39:23,"They are fully made of testicles and ovaries, so all oyster tissue transforms when they're"
00:39:23,00:39:27,spawning into reproductive organs is like all of yourself just turning into a bunch of
00:39:27,00:39:28,testicles.
00:39:28,00:39:29,That's incredible.
00:39:29,00:39:33,"That's quite, I mean, that would make the dating scene a lot easier, wouldn't it?"
00:39:33,00:39:37,Because you wouldn't know if someone was upset.
00:39:37,00:39:38,Yeah.
00:39:38,00:39:39,They turned into a testicle.
00:39:39,00:39:45,"You still want to make sure you're in attractive enough testicle over it, with a good enough sense"
00:39:45,00:39:46,of humour.
00:39:46,00:39:50,"That's really, let's get you into an uber shall we?"
00:39:50,00:39:55,"Manhandling, you'd testicle into the boot."
00:39:55,00:39:59,"Okay, that's it."
00:39:59,00:40:00,That's all of our facts.
00:40:00,00:40:01,Thank you so much for listening.
00:40:01,00:40:05,"We'll be back again next week with another four facts, and in the meantime, you can catch us"
00:40:05,00:40:08,on our Twitter feeds or you can catch these guys on their Twitter feed.
00:40:08,00:40:09,So James is on.
00:40:09,00:40:10,That's James Harkin.
00:40:10,00:40:11,Andy's on.
00:40:11,00:40:12,At Andrew Hunter M.
00:40:12,00:40:13,Ed is.
00:40:13,00:40:14,At Fox Tosser.
00:40:14,00:40:18,"The look of pain on your face when you knew you had to say it, but you made that for yourself."
00:40:18,00:40:19,"No, I didn't."
00:40:19,00:40:20,My publisher did.
00:40:20,00:40:22,That's fair enough.
00:40:22,00:40:27,You can get me on podcast at qi.com and you can listen to all our previous episodes by
00:40:27,00:40:33,"going to know such things at fish.com, you can go to qi.com/fishevents to get tickets for"
00:40:33,00:40:34,our tour.
00:40:34,00:40:38,"And also, there's loads of information on that, such thing as a fish site on our book."
00:40:38,00:40:40,And what's your book called then?
00:40:40,00:40:42,Called the Golden Atlas.
00:40:42,00:40:44,And you can get that in bookshops presumably.
00:40:44,00:40:45,Everywhere I've been.
00:40:45,00:40:46,Everywhere.
00:40:46,00:40:47,All over the world.
00:40:47,00:40:48,It is a beautiful book.
00:40:48,00:40:52,"You should definitely get it as soon as you've got ours, obviously, or by them at once."
00:40:52,00:40:54,And we'll be back again next week.
00:40:54,00:40:55,See you then.
00:40:55,00:40:55,Goodbye.
