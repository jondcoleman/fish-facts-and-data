 [BELL RINGS]

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber, and I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Huntamari, and Sarah Pasco.

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go. Starting with you, James Harkin.

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Okay, my fact this week is that the first man to use an umbrella in London was pelted with rubbish for doing so.

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 But fortunately, he had an umbrella. Was that why he took it out? He didn't, although according to his biographer, when one person threw rubbish at him, he used his umbrella to give the man a right good thrashing.

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Oh, really?

7
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Yeah. Wow. So that should be the fact. The first ever outing of an umbrella was used to beat a man. That's quite cool.

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 So this is a guy called Jonas Hamwey, and he had been to France. He was a bit of a traveler, and he came back from France, and in France they'd all been using umbrellas for quite a long time.

9
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 But in England, they were seen as kind of either a feminer or a weakness of character that you would have it or just French, which was a bad thing at the time.

10
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 So when you say it's the first person seeing public with an umbrella, it just means the first man. Like the women had them every day. They were beating each other.

11
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Right. Did I not say man? You did say men. Did I say man? Yeah. Oh, so women were used, so he was the first guy. So women were using them, and men were using them all over Europe, go on Andy.

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 Well, I think also priests were using them, because there is a limit. They're basically women in a girly clothes, always singing songs.

13
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Smelling perfume everywhere. Basically, I think they had them at funerals, but they had these huge heavy things at funerals, which maybe they'd have an assistant, because they'd be outside, and they'd be raining, so they wanted to keep dry like that.

14
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 But yeah, no proper lads, Sarah rightly points out, I did not have them, I think. Yeah, you're right. And so what happened was, if it was raining in London, this was in the 1750s, you would probably hire down a handsome cab or someone carrying a sedan chair or something like that, and that would help you get out of the rain.

15
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 And so it was the people who were driving these caps, who didn't like the guy, and so they started throwing things out, because they thought that he might put them out of business.

16
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 So I knew it was the hackney kind of carriageman that had pelted him with rubbish, but I just thought it was because he wasn't very popular.

17
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 No, so it was because actually he was their competition. So also did you know that he was anti-tipping this joke? Was he?

18
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 No, no, no.

19
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Do you mean by tipping people? So I get another reason where the hackney cab drivers might have been like, "You shut your mouth, I'm with you."

20
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 And he was anti-t-drinking?

21
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Okay. Why was the anti-t-drinking?

22
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 It's just Wikipedia says he was. Oh, I do know. Oh, you do know. So he wrote this whole essay about T, because he thought it would be, he again thought it was French, and that was a bad thing at the time.

23
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 And he said, "Men seem to have lost their stature and comeliness, and women their beauty, your very chambermaids have lost their bloom, I suppose, by sipping T."

24
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 So he thought it was bad for people.

25
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 Well, it's a good job that me, Sarah, and Dan are all drinking wine and you're drinking tea. Like an ugly chambermaid.

26
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 And it's weird isn't it, because actually umbrellas anti both Chinese, originally, so actually it feels like he's kept saying French, but it was a different kind of racist.

27
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 That was less acceptable.

28
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 But also now very English, right? Yes. Or carrying an umbrella like a businessman like that. Apparently most umbrellas are still made in China.

29
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 But actually, they found that the terracotta army is one of the chariots that has a giant umbrella that's a tattoo.

30
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 That must have been an amazing discovery when they saw that.

31
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 Because you would think you'd invent the umbrella before the house, but you'd think that in terms of people, they would get like a rough kind of covering, and hang on, we could add walls to this.

32
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 I mean, we would be that way, wow. So you think that the house is just a very advanced umbrella?

33
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Umbrella, it is. If they were to look at, oh my gosh, look what they've done. I've got toilets in their umbrellas.

34
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 This was the 1700s that this happened in, but do you know the first time that an umbrella was mentioned in the UK was in the 1600s.

35
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 Okay. And it was in a book by Thomas Corriott. He was a court jester for the son of King James I.

36
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 And he wrote this amazing book, which came out in the same year as the King James Bible, which was called Corriott's Crudities, hastily gobbled up in five months travel.

37
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 And he went from London to Venice in the same pair of shoes, and he came back.

38
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 Oh, it sounds like someone who needs an Edinburgh show. Doesn't it sound like a third year scraping the barrel?

39
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 I'm going to walk to Venice and I'm not going to change my shoes.

40
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 Oh, yeah, so he came back and he put his supposedly put his shoes into a church hung them up.

41
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 He was like, this is the one pair I wore. And he was quite famous in his day.

42
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 So in his book, he mentions umbrellas for the first time, because as he was passing through Europe, he saw them.

43
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 He also mentions the fact that everyone was eating using this fort device. And that supposedly as well is how we started using forts.

44
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 That's interesting, because actually, I think the first people to use forks were kind of ridiculed, weren't they?

45
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 Yes, again, effeminate, I think. Were they? Yeah.

46
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 There was one famous guy, I can't remember who it was, who used to fork, and was known as fork user.

47
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 And that was supposed to be an insult. It would be like, you fork user.

48
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 It's that because it sounded exactly like fork user.

49
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 Yeah, it's that sound. Is that what we got it from?

50
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 Do you know what early umbrellas were nicknamed in England?

51
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 No. They were called Robinson's, because in the book, Robinson Crusoe, he makes himself an umbrella.

52
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 Before he makes a house. Yeah. It's all coming together. How did it make sense?

53
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 Do you know who had the first umbrella covered with kevlar to make it a bulletproof?

54
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 No, no. Nicola Sarkozy.

55
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 Why? Isn't he? Yeah, he was like, I'm going to be dry and safe.

56
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 Anyway, there's a sky assassins.

57
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 Wow. Did he carry the umbrella or was that a bodyguard?

58
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 No, he held it himself.

59
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 It must have been very heavy. How many other people have them now?

60
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Yeah. Who's in heavy kevlar? I'm assuming it must be.

61
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 I assume so. But maybe not. I mean, I'm sure he had special stuff as light as possible.

62
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 He'll be making houses out of kevlar next.

63
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 I found some famous umbrellas that I thought, is there a Wikipedia list of famous umbrellas?

64
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 It should be. And there should also be an umbrella museum where they keep them, because I would definitely go.

65
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 I haven't found an umbrella museum. I have found an umbrella cover museum.

66
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 Huh? What do you mean the thing that slips over it?

67
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 You know when you buy a short umbrella and it's got that little sort of slip of material.

68
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 That little power that you lose within about 20 seconds.

69
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 Yeah. There's a museum in Maine devoted to those.

70
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 You're kidding. No. The website says, people flocked by the tents to see the museum.

71
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 People were thrilled to donate their old umbrella sheets and the international press went bonkers.

72
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 So the umbrella is that I would put into the museum if I had a couple of entries.

73
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 The first one is Mary Kingsley's umbrella.

74
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 Oh, yeah. Very important umbrella. And I'm surprised that it's not in the RGS.

75
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 I'm surprised that I couldn't find if anyone's actually got it.

76
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 Because it was the umbrella that she used to ward off the animals.

77
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 Famously, she smacked her hippopotamus away while she was in her canoe.

78
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 So she was an explorer in Africa wasn't she?

79
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 Yeah, she was. And she went out of time when she was still, she didn't even wear trousers.

80
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 She still wore a full Victorian garb, the dress. Like it was insane.

81
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 And she was like, "Sounds like such a bitch."

82
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 She was like, "What can hippos if umbrellas get there in my way?"

83
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 "You went to Africa if you didn't put any trousers on for God's sake."

84
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 "Who's in the wrong habitat here?"

85
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 I'm being unfair on her. She tickled the behind the veneer of a hippopotamus in order to get it away.

86
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 That's nice when you say that.

87
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 And I think she kicked a crocodile in the face and I'm not sure.

88
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 Yeah. So that's one umbrella because she was an incredible explorer.

89
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 And the second one is the umbrella that was thought to have assassinated JFK.

90
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 Do you know about this story?

91
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 Oh no, is that a theory?

92
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 I've heard about umbrella man.

93
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 Umbrella man. So umbrella man, I hadn't heard of this.

94
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 So in the famous footage of the JFK assassination, there's famously this shot

95
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 when people are analysing it and not knowing where the shot might have come from.

96
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 Out of nowhere, as the car is passing a bunch of people on the side,

97
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 there's just this one guy standing there holding an umbrella.

98
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 Oh.

99
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 And it's a sunny day, there's no reason.

100
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 Yeah. And they thought, how is this possible?

101
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 It could have been a parasol, that's true. It was an umbrella though. It was a dark umbrella.

102
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 It turned out that it was a guy who was actually protesting Kennedy's father

103
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 because Kennedy's father was a sympathizer with Neville Chamberlain who was quite nice to the Nazis

104
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 during his time and he was just protesting that.

105
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 Okay, that doesn't make any sense.

106
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 Like if his father was a rain cloud, great protest.

107
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 Well, because apparently a trademark accessory of Chamberlains was to carry an umbrella.

108
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 Okay, that's still like six removes.

109
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 So he had to explain to everyone what your protest meant.

110
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 He had to go to a fancy dress party where you look nothing like what you're supposed to be.

111
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 Yeah.

112
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 You have to explain to everyone.

113
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 Or being an impressionist who goes, oh, hello.

114
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 That was uncanny.

115
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 Well, except that while Kennedy was at Harvard, he wrote a thesis.

116
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 And it kind of, that was very much a part of that.

117
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 So he thought Kennedy would get the little nod.

118
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 And so everyone's going, who's the umbrella man?

119
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 He turned himself in, he brought the umbrella in and basically explained this convoluted reason why it was protesting.

120
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 And this is the quote from me said, I think if the Guinness Book of World Records had a category for people

121
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 who were at the wrong place at the wrong time doing the wrong thing, I would be number one in that position.

122
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 Wow.

123
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 Because he was there two seconds or so before Kennedy and Shawna.

124
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 So there is a website which claims that in 1797 there was only one umbrella in Cambridge

125
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 and that you could hire it out for an hour at a time.

126
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 So 1797.

127
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 I think as soon as it starts raining, there's going to be a rush in there.

128
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 But I don't know what there was only one there.

129
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 But it's true that in Paris, it was common practice as then you could hire them out by the hour.

130
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 And they had that they were all clearly recognizable.

131
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 They had a number painted on so they couldn't be next.

132
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 Yeah.

133
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 So it was like the Boris bike.

134
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 Oh, yeah, like the bike system.

135
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 Yeah.

136
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 Except obviously they could be next.

137
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 I don't know how you would legislate against that or prevent it.

138
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 In France because they had the bike system before us then they weren't getting stolen there.

139
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 It's really interesting culturally that in Paris they left them all and in Amsterdam they all got stolen instantly.

140
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 I don't know what we're doing.

141
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 Really?

142
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 What are we doing in London?

143
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 I think they're too heavy in shit aren't they?

144
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 Yeah, very heavy.

145
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 Yeah.

146
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 I think if you're kind of riding that around, someone's going to know that it's not your actual bike.

147
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 You reckon.

148
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 People are like detectives like that sometimes.

149
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 Just we were talking about ancient China before in the umbrella.

150
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 Something I thought I'd show you guys which obviously doesn't translate too well but people can google this.

151
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 The Chinese character for umbrella, San, it was designed to look just like an umbrella.

152
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 Oh.

153
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 So part of the...

154
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 It looks like a house.

155
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 It does, doesn't it?

156
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 Yeah.

157
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 Yeah.

158
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 That's it there.

159
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 Yeah.

160
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 It's just nice little bit of how Chinese words often work is that you actually designed it initially to look like that.

161
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 Did they look like that?

162
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

163
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 So if I was to read Chinese, I get a clue of what the words are by looking at what they look like.

164
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 Well, in its origin.

165
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 So when I was taught Mandarin as a kid, you would start with the super simplified pictorial versions of it.

166
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 And it would show you that the turtle image would look exactly like a turtle and it slowly became hardened and edged and so on.

167
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 The number is one, two, three.

168
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 They're just lines.

169
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 Yeah, for one and then add a two and a three.

170
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 Yeah.

171
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 Yeah.

172
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 I kind of believe you but then also I think maybe you went to special classes.

173
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 I don't make Mandarin easy for deaf.

174
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 I get the turtle droiga.

175
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 We'll just accept it.

176
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 That's what it is.

177
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 Some stuff about throwing rubbish at things.

178
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 Sure.

179
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 So when Black Fire's bridge was opened, so it was a replacement bridge and Queen Victoria opened it and there's a statue of her at the end.

180
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 And she'd been in mourning for ages, like for Albert, so the crowd really hated her by then, so they pelted her with vegetables.

181
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 Really?

182
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 Yeah.

183
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 Why didn't I hate her?

184
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 Because she hadn't been to see them for such a long time, like decades.

185
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 Why so they threw vegetables at her?

186
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 Did anyone get any trouble?

187
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 The presumably they did.

188
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 Maybe they all said it was the wrong place at the wrong time.

189
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 And it was the protest and change.

190
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 We're just protesting Lord Liverpool when he used to like cabbage.

191
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 We don't want to go to the Crimean War.

192
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Umbrella inventions is one of the main inventions of people try.

193
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 I think mouse traps is one of them and Umbrella is the other one.

194
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 I invented a mouse trap.

195
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 Did you?

196
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 It was for pick pockets.

197
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 So you put a mouse trap in your pocket and then when someone tries to get into your pocket, it traps their fingers

198
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 and then you have to take them two miles away and release them in a fear.

199
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 That's good, but it makes your pockets unusable, doesn't it?

200
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 Yes, you mustn't forget and put your hands in your pocket.

201
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 There's a museum at the UK and I wish I could remember which one it is.

202
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 But they have one of the oldest examples of a mouse trap inside a glass box.

203
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 And the curator came back one morning and found a mouse trap in it because it managed to get inside the box.

204
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 Clearly, clearly sets and so an ancient mouse trap that was never meant to be used.

205
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 Caught a modern day mouse like time travel.

206
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 I once went to a museum in Bhutan and it was run by monks and they had a mouse problem that they discovered on that day when I was there.

207
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 But it's monks so they didn't want to kill the mouse or even hurt it in any way.

208
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 So they were just running after it chasing after all these monks running in and out of rooms like an old fast.

209
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 I love how they think that that's not stressful for mice.

210
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 I don't want to stress them out. It's going to be like a hundred times bigger than the rest of the room.

211
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 A lot of them have, so you know about toxic plasma. Have you talked about it before?

212
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

213
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 So loads of mice have it and it means they're not scared of cats and they're not scared of humans when they have it.

214
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 Those are humans as well.

215
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 Yeah, with humans as well.

216
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 But so the theory is the people who really like worship cats is because so lots of people are carrying so many really dangerous for babies to get it.

217
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 But most lots of human beings have it and the theory is that that's why they assume it's who just love cats.

218
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 I'm not just like, oh hey, I've got a cat but like this cat is my secret wife.

219
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 My wife's like that.

220
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 My real wife not my son.

221
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 My wife's like that cat.

222
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 Ginger, she always comes home at night.

223
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 I love to go into the baby's house. I think it's the upper mouse.

224
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Sarah.

225
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 Okay, so my fact is about men and it's about how the male brain changes when his partner is pregnant.

226
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 Okay, how does it change?

227
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 Well, this is all very early research and a lot of the studies I've looked into have a very small amount of subject.

228
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 But it seems like things happen from literally four to six weeks of finding out his partner is pregnant.

229
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 No matter when that is, the testosterone starts to drop and he starts to produce prolactin, which is a hormone that creates milk production in female mammals.

230
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 But in male mammals makes them less aggressive.

231
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 So it's what's really, really interesting is it seems like I'm in cortisol changes as well.

232
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 Cortisol is a stressful hormone, but in men and women it also causes you to put on weight because you're storing energy.

233
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 So for a long time there's been a theory about, and they've kind of called sympathetic male pregnancies.

234
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 Or I think it's called Kuvaard syndrome, which is when the men start to get nauseous and get morning sickness.

235
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 And they get, they put on weight as well.

236
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 There's now a theory that actually in terms of resources, the man putting on weight is quite sensible in terms of storing energy

237
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 because he's going to have to do a lot more and give a lot more resources once there's a baby.

238
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 So it's really fascinating.

239
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 Wait, what does the male give in terms of that more body on a male?

240
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 Well, if you think about it, like if you have more body fat than you don't have tweets as much, you work harder, and also...

241
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 You give your food away.

242
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 Yeah, exactly.

243
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 So if you think about times of sort of fast and famine, any kind of stored energy is the difference between living and dying.

244
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 Yeah.

245
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 The cortisol thing is interesting.

246
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 So the other thing I found out when I was looking into this is that the more stressed the mother is, the more cortisol she produces.

247
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 And obviously having a new baby is very, very stressful, the faster the baby grows through her breast milk.

248
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 So cortisol...

249
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 And it doesn't mean that's a child.

250
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 As a child it's better to make your mother more stressed.

251
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 Yes.

252
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 That's exactly what it means.

253
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 Thank you for putting it.

254
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 They've done rat studies, and I hate animal studies.

255
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 And I don't think they're applicable, but they do, obviously, awful things to animals.

256
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 But with rats, if they really, really stressed the mother out, then her children would come out much, much tougher with higher levels of cortisol

257
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 and testosterone and things like, already, as if they're prepared for a horrible world.

258
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 Wow.

259
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 It's a kind of theory, which is really interesting, that whatever you do to the mother, especially through breast milk, she's telling, she's programming her children, you need to be ready for this.

260
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 Do you have to be aware that your wife is pregnant or does your body...

261
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 Yes, well this is thing, I have so many questions about it.

262
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 And number one, this is such a heteronormative study.

263
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 Yes.

264
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 Well, it's the first one, I'm sure, that adoptive parents, people who go through IVF, what about gay parents?

265
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 Does this all, this is all the same thing?

266
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 I have all these questions, and then it's like, we studied 29 heterosexual couples.

267
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 Oh, okay.

268
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 And did some salivary hormone tests, also, I have to say, so there would be one test that we'll find, oh my god, men have this amount of testosterone, then when their parents are pregnant, and then it'll be replicated and they don't find it, but they'll find something else.

269
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 Okay.

270
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 So it seems like, and also, with the brain, because of neuroplasticity, it's so different from lots of people anyway, that there's never an absolute, a hundred percent, all people do this.

271
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 I was kind of thinking if you had a one-night stand with someone, you're looking at your body going, you put on a billway.

272
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 Yeah, that's the way you go home with your girlfriend and say, hang on.

273
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 Did really nothing happen in IVF?

274
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 Because you've got more in sickness.

275
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 Yes, in the morning sickness, in these studies, they were saying that men get more in sickness as well.

276
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 Yeah, they can, yeah.

277
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 And the sympathy, cramps and everything, which is really interesting.

278
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 We didn't notice it for ages, because most of the experiments done were on, as you say, rats.

279
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 And rats, fathers, as it were, don't look after their offspring.

280
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 Yeah.

281
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 So it's when they started experimenting on marmosets, where the males do look after their offspring, that they notice these hormonal changes in marmosets.

282
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Yes.

283
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 Yeah.

284
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 So it's one of those things where there are some things that are kind of hardwired, because physically we can do them.

285
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 But it's very, very unpopular to say, because it looks like you're reinforcing all these things we're trying to get away from, which is a gender binary.

286
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 And things like being biologically different between men and women, which actually, it's a really, really complex area.

287
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 And it's not popular, they don't want to study it, people don't want to do it.

288
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 So is that considered controversial?

289
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 Kind of.

290
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 So if you were to stand up a feminist meter, and be like, guys, that is not your fault.

291
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 Like, you evolved to make babies, and until very recently, that's what happened if you had sex.

292
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 See you later, I mean, do you?

293
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 Right.

294
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 Yeah, okay. And it's the same with the studies of the brain. They try and say like really complementary things about both genders rather than negatives.

295
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 So rather than going, oh, women maybe are less spatially aware, and it's not ever true.

296
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 In terms of it's just like, oh, they'll do a study, and it seems like, oh, many are using their brain this way or this way.

297
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 And then you look at people who have brought up differently, and it's not true.

298
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 But the brain is so elastic in terms of how it's used.

299
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 People who do loads of maths are better at maths.

300
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 And that seems to be the thing, because it's really difficult not to be reductive and telling people.

301
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 And it's the same with men, like, obviously 90% of criminals are male.

302
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 And I'm talking of clients, and it's a theory that's because the amygdala is much bigger and the prefrontal cortex develops much later.

303
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 So you have this emotional instinctual brain that isn't very good at controlling itself, and that's very sexist.

304
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 So to men like, you're just crazy.

305
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 You're just much closer to monkeys.

306
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 Right.

307
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 I read a really good article.

308
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 It was a study from 2015 at Tel Aviv University.

309
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 And they were saying, OK, well, if you look at men's brains and women's brains, if you look at them generally,

310
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 you can say, OK, generally a men's brain will be a bit like this.

311
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 And generally a woman's brain will be a bit like this.

312
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 But actually, 98% of people they studied didn't fit a clear cut profile.

313
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 That's it.

314
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 So you can kind of say, generally speaking, it's like this, but if you take an individual, it's not a bit like that.

315
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 It's really fascinating.

316
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 So this, obviously, men's brains were about 10% bigger, which is complex to body size, really.

317
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 But what's really fascinating is that there's a lot of, so dyslexia, ADHD, things like that are all much, much more prevalent in men than women.

318
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 And they don't know why.

319
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 And sort of the genetic basis for that.

320
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 But there's certain kind of brain disorders, which are just, you're much more likely, an autism as well.

321
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 It's more male.

322
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 And the testosterone and the crime thing.

323
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 But I didn't realize as well.

324
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 The testosterone doesn't actually get into the brain.

325
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 There's a kind of, there's a something in the brain stem that turns it into a different hormone because of how it would actually change the structure.

326
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 There was just on the men and pregnancy thing of the physiological changes to the man and pregnancy.

327
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 They did do a load of surveys of men about the symptoms that they'd experienced physically when their partner's a pregnant.

328
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 I bet their wives were like, what for me for now?

329
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 How this affected you, darling?

330
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 Well, a lot of them complained of stomach cramps, basically.

331
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 But there were a few kind of illustrative lines.

332
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 One man said, my stomach pains were very much like a buildup of woman's contraction as she's giving birth.

333
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 They start a mild and then got stronger and stronger and stronger.

334
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 Another man claimed, I think I was in more pain than she was.

335
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 Well, the crime thing's interesting.

336
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 The crime thing's interesting because oxytocin, which is a hormone that does make you bond,

337
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 which does raise for men, especially in the last trimester of pregnancy.

338
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 And obviously it's what a woman releases when she breastfees.

339
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 It also causes muscle contractions.

340
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 So it's what causes an orgasm in everyone.

341
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 And so actually, if he had raised oxytocin, that would absolutely make sense about cramping.

342
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 Wow.

343
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 Yeah.

344
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 Okay. So, my reading out the line for a cheap laugh at this man saying, I think I was in more pain than she was.

345
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 Yeah.

346
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 May have had point behind it.

347
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 Also, do you know what?

348
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 I think people say stuff like that with a wink that we don't hear.

349
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 Yeah.

350
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 That's the problem with the internet.

351
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 Very true.

352
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 I think so many things that we people say are joking.

353
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 Yeah.

354
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 And then we write it down and go, what a bastard.

355
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 I'm going to send him a turd in the post.

356
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 I think today they were talking about, so women's grey matter actually decreases in certain parts of her brain.

357
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 And that's so she can become obsessed with a baby.

358
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 Wow. Really?

359
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 She has to be obsessed with it.

360
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 Oh, it'll die.

361
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 Yeah.

362
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 And it's caused by hormones.

363
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 But you have to have a baby and then just want to stare at it constantly.

364
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 Otherwise, someone else is going to eat it.

365
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 Yeah.

366
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 I mean, someone else, like a wolf or something.

367
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 Like Roger from next to him.

368
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 But I think when they first found that out, they saw that the emotion part of your brain shrunk a little bit.

369
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 And everyone thought, that doesn't make any sense at all.

370
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 And then they realized, actually, you're just decluttering, like getting rid of all that not important.

371
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 Yeah, like pruning, they call it.

372
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 And this is the thing with the brain.

373
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 They say this thing that, oh, that's the emotional part of your brain.

374
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 That's the drive and it's always so much more complicated than that.

375
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 Like, so the amygdala, which is like this emotional centre, really, really ancient brain,

376
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 also is connected to terms of what you remember in terms of trauma.

377
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 And we're really like animal instinct.

378
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 And that's, I think, they used to call it like the lizard brain and that.

379
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 And it was the thing which kind of attaches you to when we were living in the sea or whatever.

380
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 And it's just instinct, but of course, like you say, it's all really over simplistic.

381
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 But then also in terms of, I mean, all of us included, will lay people.

382
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 How else are you supposed to understand this really complicated science?

383
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 And then someone goes, that's the really old bit, like, you know, it was a fish.

384
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 This bit, it's monkey bit, remember when you were monkey.

385
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 It is interesting, though, that the brain can't understand itself.

386
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 That is interesting.

387
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 Yeah, you have, what's that theory of yours?

388
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 Well, I think it's the only thing that's ever named itself.

389
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 Yes, that's so cool.

390
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 I tried to write stand up about how, you know, when you go like, oh my god, the brain's amazing.

391
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 How arrogant it is that it's your brain telling you.

392
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 Yeah.

393
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 You're like, should I brain?

394
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 It's the most complex thing we know of in the galaxy.

395
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 I don't think we'll ever understand the brain.

396
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 Excuse me.

397
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 Bragging about yourself.

398
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 You know what you're saying about the great matter of shrinking.

399
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 So if you were to do a list of every animal species on Earth in terms of how, let's say,

400
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 loved a newbornness, where would we appear on that list?

401
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 We're very, very high, but sad thing.

402
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 And if anyone watches Blackfish, the documentary, which is...

403
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 Is that like Black Mirror for Fish?

404
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 People don't even talk about how clever fish are.

405
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 Yeah.

406
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 Tiny Booker nips their idea.

407
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 So Blackfish is, and it's really interesting.

408
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 Orcas, orcas also have menopause like us.

409
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 Grandparents never stop caring for their young, young, never leave their parents.

410
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 The part of their brain, which we're, again, very crudely would say, is to do with familial love.

411
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 It's like two and a half times bigger than ours.

412
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 And when their children are taken away from them in the wild to go to aquariums,

413
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 they cry for the rest of their lives.

414
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 Whoa!

415
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 Yeah.

416
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 Does that mean Queen Victoria was an orca?

417
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 What?

418
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 Oh, because she was sad for the rest of her life.

419
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 Guys, I think I've blown this thing wide open.

420
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 I've never seen her without a big dress on, which might have been hiding.

421
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 Exactly.

422
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 And the massive tail.

423
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 She was a human head on an orca.

424
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 That's why they threw things at her.

425
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 Because she was a weird orca queen.

426
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 Oh, my God.

427
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 This is the...

428
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 Yeah, they saw her emerge from the Thames to open Blackfish's bridge again.

429
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 This is Splash the Sequel.

430
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 Yeah.

431
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 Yeah, because I read the giraffes when they're born.

432
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 This is quite separate, but just thinking how like how the human body just is very much,

433
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 everyone's around, takes the baby out, cuts a cord.

434
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 It needs us to be there, basically.

435
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 With giraffes, they're born with slippers.

436
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 Right.

437
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 Yeah, they're born with slippers and their horns are bendy.

438
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 What do you mean slippers?

439
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 They have this odd thing around their hooves.

440
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 Are they hooves?

441
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 Yeah.

442
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 And they shed about like three months after they're born.

443
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 Or maybe three days.

444
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 Three days or three months.

445
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 Every other species other than us gives birth to young that are ready to live.

446
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 And we don't.

447
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 So we give birth and then the baby continues growing.

448
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 And that's things to always remember in terms of the brain and that's as a species.

449
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 Our whole society, all of our personal interactions are because we can't just have a baby

450
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 and look after it on our own.

451
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 Because the brain is so big.

452
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 Yeah.

453
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 Yeah.

454
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 Massive.

455
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 Oh, stop it with your brain.

456
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 Every time we talk about the brain on this show, I get blown away by the oddness of what we are constantly learning about it.

457
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 Yeah.

458
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 Because it just completely flips.

459
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 Yeah.

460
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 It's just such big knowledge every time we learn something new.

461
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 So this is not new, but there's blew my mind today when I read it, blew my brain to that.

462
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 So my brain is being blown by its own abilities.

463
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 Yeah.

464
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 I bet it literally in our side of skull, when you learn brain facts, your brain is like walking up and down.

465
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 I'm doing a moonwalk like I know it.

466
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 So if you sleep in a new place, let's say a new house, a new hotel, anywhere you've gone to, that's not your regular place.

467
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 Half of your brain stays in a kind of alert position so that it can just wake up for new sounds.

468
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 Yes.

469
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 Like a dolphin, exactly.

470
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 Victoria.

471
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 So newer plasticity, which is the really exciting thing, the books have been written about it, are so amazing in terms of the brain the way it prunes itself.

472
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 That thing about, if you go to new places all the time, people who travel and get new stimuli, they build new ones all of the time because they have to, and that benefits all of the brain.

473
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 So there's things that's so fascinating and Dick Swab's book.

474
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 He talks about how, so your brain, if it doesn't use certain parts, it prunes them as a child.

475
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 So people who go up in the east, who don't have certain sounds, like the R sound, their brain prunes them, and then when they learn English later on, they can't pronounce words properly.

476
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 Because their brain physically has got rid of that part.

477
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 Yeah, same with those and other languages as well.

478
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 Yeah, maybe can do, has the ability in theory to be able to do every single sound that's known to man, but then you just lose it.

479
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 Yeah, which is the brain going, and it's not a detriment, it's going, I'm going to use this for stuff I do need.

480
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 Yeah, right. Should we move on to the next part?

481
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 Let's see, that guy's name is Dick Swab.

482
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 Oh, no.

483
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 Yeah.

484
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 And he wrote, and he's one of the babies today.

485
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 He's huge.

486
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 He's huge.

487
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 He's huge.

488
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 He's huge.

489
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 There's like three amazing brain books at the moment, and here's one of them.

490
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 Yeah, and that's his name.

491
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 But the thing is, what ship said it three times, you get used to say?

492
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 You do, and what do you do?

493
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 I think if I was friends with Dick Swab, I would never get used to that.

494
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 You'd think that when his, like he handed the book in, he said to the editor of the public,

495
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 and he said to the editor of the publisher, "Any changes?"

496
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 They went, "Actually, yeah, that Mr. Swab."

497
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 Yeah.

498
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 Oh, "A Swab" is even worse.

499
00:28:51,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

500
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 My pact is that a fifth of all the species of coral on the planet have been named by the same man.

501
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 Yeah.

502
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 What's his name?

503
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 His name is John Veron.

504
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 I hope I'm pronouncing it right.

505
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 His nickname is Charlie, which doesn't sound like a nickname, but actually it was in school.

506
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 He was a teacher said, "Hey, Charles Darwin, stop doing that because he was doing some cool experiment with animals."

507
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 He put him back.

508
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 Yeah.

509
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 So the Galapagos have his connecting features again.

510
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 So he's a marine biologist, and he's been nicknamed the Godfather of coral.

511
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 He's 71 years old now, but he has done so much in the world of looking at coral exploits.

512
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 He's looking at coral exploring it, studying it, categorizing it.

513
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 So in 1972, he was made the first full-time researcher on the Great Barrier Reef,

514
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 and he's spent more hours diving down there than anybody else in the world.

515
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 He's studied more of it than any other human alive.

516
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 And he was interviewed in the FT last weekend, and he's an extraordinary guy.

517
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 So I thought...

518
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 He is.

519
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 When he comes over to the UK, David Attenborough will introduce him on to stage,

520
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 and introduce him by saying that this is one of the most important scientists in our time.

521
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 He's a huge, huge deal.

522
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 Really exciting character.

523
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 Has he done a TED talk?

524
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 So he's not that big a deal, actually.

525
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 Are they like about it?

526
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 No.

527
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 Have you done one?

528
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 No.

529
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 Oh, OK.

530
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 No, I wasn't like about the talk challenge.

531
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 I mean, a TED talk about coral, right?

532
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 OK.

533
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 So I just get a bit jealous.

534
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 Has he ever been on QI?

535
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 Yeah.

536
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 Has he?

537
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 God, I'd love it if they just occasionally.

538
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 Yeah.

539
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 This is because of quotas.

540
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 They had to have a deep sea diver.

541
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 Sarah Haskell and Dick Swarth.

542
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 (LAUGHTER)

543
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 Yeah, so go on, Andy.

544
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 So generally, when you get kind of soft corals and hard corals,

545
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 but hard corals are the ones which live in colonies with lots of little individual animals,

546
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 and they excrete the skeleton of calcium carbonate, which becomes the reef and grows.

547
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 So that's what the...

548
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 Yeah, that's not the animal, that's the kind of shell, isn't it?

549
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 Yeah.

550
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 Exactly, yeah.

551
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 And they have tentacles around their mouth, and they can catch things.

552
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 They can catch little bits of prey, even some small fish.

553
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 They can catch and eat them, and they're very, very cool.

554
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 Do you know that they kiss?

555
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 No, I don't know the coral kiss.

556
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 What?

557
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 Oh, James.

558
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 (LAUGHTER)

559
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 It's a really sexy gap here.

560
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 (LAUGHTER)

561
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 My wife is a coral, actually.

562
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 (LAUGHTER)

563
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 Yeah, they've got this new little camera.

564
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 It's a new kind of camera.

565
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 It's called the Benfic Underwater Microscope or Bum.

566
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 Yeah.

567
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 Unfortunately.

568
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 But it lets you see what's happening that very, very close up.

569
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 And they found that these polyps, which is what makes the coral, they get the food,

570
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 and then they pass on nutrients to each other by kind of kissing each other.

571
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 Wow.

572
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 Isn't that amazing?

573
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 That's amazing.

574
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 Is there benefit to an individual from passing on nutrients to another nearby?

575
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 Well, I think generally speaking, that's true in a lot of animals.

576
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 When you all benefit from the kind of the ecosystem, don't you?

577
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

578
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 I'm sure they now understand that you all kind of survive together.

579
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 That's great.

580
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 They all made it the full moon as well.

581
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 Oh, yeah.

582
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 Because of the light.

583
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 Once a year, it might be the light, or it might be them sensing something else,

584
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 or it might be the tide, I don't know.

585
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 Yeah.

586
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 But, yeah, they...

587
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 Yeah, because they have higher tides.

588
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 Yeah.

589
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 They do this thing called broadcast spawning, where they all release this blizzard of, you know, bundles into the ocean.

590
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 They're really brightly coloured.

591
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 I don't know, it was so sexy.

592
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 (LAUGHTER)

593
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 I'm moonlight, yeah.

594
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 It's sexy down on the race.

595
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 It is, it is.

596
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 (LAUGHTER)

597
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 Yeah.

598
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 Wow.

599
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 I get really confused by coral.

600
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 I don't understand what it is exactly in terms of...

601
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 There's no brain.

602
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 No, right.

603
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 But there is some kind of system that means they know how to reproduce.

604
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 What kind of intelligence level are they at?

605
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 Is it nothing, and it's just a kind of system that...

606
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 I think it's like, if you think of everything as a tube, we are a tube.

607
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 It's stomach, anus, and you have a nervous system.

608
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 Yeah.

609
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 So they just have a more simplistic version of what we've got.

610
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 Okay.

611
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 Well, corals are not tubes, in fact, because they don't have an anus.

612
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 Well, the mouth functions as an anus, and they have to excrete via the mouth.

613
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 Yeah.

614
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 Because they're attached to the reef, and they're facing outwards into the world.

615
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 Nice.

616
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 So they're like a wind sock.

617
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 (LAUGHTER)

618
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 But in the wind sock of the sea.

619
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 But getting less sexy as we've done.

620
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 I think it's like a wind sock, it's quite sexy.

621
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 (LAUGHTER)

622
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 No.

623
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 And he's chatted with loads of them, though.

624
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 (LAUGHTER)

625
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 Was it...

626
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 What was it, Ken?

627
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 Livingston chatted something up with...

628
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 A small deer.

629
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 Like a broom handle in the morning.

630
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 That was his chatted liar.

631
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 How nice.

632
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 I'm like a broom handle, though.

633
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 And the cub was in the cub website.

634
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 (LAUGHTER)

635
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 Yeah, but no, you're right, Dan,

636
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 because they are confusing.

637
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 They were thought to be plants, corals, until the 18th century,

638
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 because you would think so from looking at them.

639
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 Yeah.

640
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 But they're hugely important.

641
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 And also, they're dying out.

642
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 So the Great Barrier Reef has been...

643
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 They call it bleaching, where...

644
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 Yeah.

645
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 ...they're allowing a little algae living inside the coral,

646
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 which photosynthesize sunlight and provide the coral with loads of its energy.

647
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 When the temperature changes, those algae produce too much oxygen

648
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 that stresses the coral out and damages it.

649
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 So they expel the algae, and then that's the coral bleached,

650
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 because those algae are very brightly coloured.

651
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 So actually, if you look at coral, it's very brightly coloured,

652
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 but actually it's the algae which is colourful,

653
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 and coral is just white.

654
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 So a white coral is like a dead coral?

655
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 Basically, yeah.

656
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 If they don't get the algae back in time,

657
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 when the temperature returns to normal, then that coral is dead.

658
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 It's interesting, isn't it?

659
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 Because we would probably think of algae as a bad thing for living,

660
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 like if you're covered in algae.

661
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 Yeah.

662
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 Yeah, for people, it's really bad.

663
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 It's not for them. Yeah, it's really, really vital.

664
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 So coral is dying at the moment.

665
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 In the northwest coast of Bali, they've been doing this thing.

666
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 There's a beach that if you walk along, I'm going to pronounce it wrong,

667
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 but it's Pemetaran.

668
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 If you walk along this beach, you'll see power cables going into the ocean.

669
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 So literally, you'll be walking over power cables.

670
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 And what they've been doing is they've been attaching low-voltage power cables to corals

671
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 to stimulate them from all the bleaching that's going on.

672
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 So they're giving a little electric shocks into these coral,

673
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 and for some reason, and again, they're slightly, yeah, they're into it,

674
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 but it's slightly like we haven't shown in any study

675
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 that they're better than any of the other methods that we're doing.

676
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 And I think it's still a bit new research,

677
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 but that's what they're doing at the moment.

678
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 They're putting electric cables onto coral.

679
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 Basically, the whole problem is the sea temperature rising,

680
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 which is not something that can be counteracted, large scale.

681
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 You know, if it goes up by one degree, it's really bad for them,

682
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 and we're looking at one-on-a-half or two degrees of rise in the ocean temperature.

683
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 That's the kind of thing that's like, even if we stop now,

684
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 that's the irreversible changes, isn't it?

685
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 Yeah, and the really terrible thing is, well, that's the really terrible thing.

686
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 But also, so shallow coral reefs, there are different kinds.

687
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 The tiny amount of the ocean surface, obviously,

688
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 but about 25% of marine species have a home in and around and on reefs,

689
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 as in they're these huge habitats.

690
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 Yes, it's like one percent of the oceans, but 25% of the...

691
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 There's 0.1% of the ocean surface.

692
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 There's 25% of marine species that manage to find a home there.

693
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 So it's this huge knock-on effect that might happen if we lose coral reefs.

694
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 Yeah, but have you heard about the twilight zone?

695
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 No.

696
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 So the twilight zone is a deep reef.

697
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 And a deep reef is really interesting because it's far down enough

698
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 that it would require extra scuba gear in a way that isn't affordable, really.

699
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 But it's not deep enough that you would send a submersible

700
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 that was either manned by humans or done by remote.

701
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 So they haven't really studied it.

702
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 And only in the last 20 years they've been studying this twilight zone of reef,

703
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 where they found that all the fish that live in it are exactly the same

704
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 as it appears they might have been for hundreds of millions of years.

705
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 As in, most coral higher up would be subject to, say, ice ages and so on.

706
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 And they couldn't escape from it because they wouldn't know how to go deeper.

707
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 So there's this whole level of new reef that they're studying.

708
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 They had most ability in that whole time.

709
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 Yes, they had no change because they wouldn't need to escape the glaciers

710
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 or that deep enough.

711
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 That's the thing with that statistic.

712
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 And I'm not about to poo poo it, the 25% thing.

713
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 But obviously there's so much of the ocean we haven't studied

714
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 because it's too difficult to get to.

715
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 So actually that 25% of the ones we can count, which are in the bright shallow bits.

716
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 I read something about the sea floor today.

717
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 This isn't really related, apart from it's in the sea.

718
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 But there's a place called Octopolis, which is just off the coast of Australia.

719
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 Most ox pusses kind of live on their own.

720
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 And this is a place where ox pusses kind of come together and hang out.

721
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 And they kind of touch each other, which else pusses don't really like to do much

722
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 when they're not mating or fighting.

723
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 But it's a place where they kind of hang out.

724
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 It's like a swingers club.

725
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 Why did you drop your pen?

726
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 It's a swingers club.

727
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 It's a swingers club.

728
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 I knew I knew you from somewhere.

729
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 Octopolis mistress.

730
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 No, no.

731
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 Don't tell your cat why.

732
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 She's a carol.

733
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 So here's the really interesting thing about that, right?

734
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 So ox pusses are really, really smart, really smart.

735
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 But they're not quite as smart as things with a similar size brain

736
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 that live out of the water.

737
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 And one of the reasons is they're not social.

738
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 And they think that by being social it helps your intelligence.

739
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 But they think that this kind of area of octopus is because they're all kind of hanging out together.

740
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 They might get smarter and smarter and smarter.

741
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 And if we were to leave them alone, they might get super smart.

742
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 So you know, that's the tribal effect is what it's called in human beings.

743
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 And Susan Pinker wrote a book about it, which I don't think she mentions animals at all.

744
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
 But that's the theories.

745
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 The more you interact with other beings that you have to learn to communicate,

746
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 you become more intelligent.

747
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
 And she heard theories that men who communicate more and more tribal live longer.

748
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 And that it's, you know, the whole, there's all these theories that men talk a lot less.

749
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 They have a small vocabulary.

750
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 They talk less every day in tribes where they talk as much as women.

751
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
 They live as long as the women.

752
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 Oh, they say.

753
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 It's a theory and that's what I've got to say about it.

754
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
 Yeah.

755
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 There's a fish called file fish.

756
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
 Yep.

757
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 They eat coral.

758
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 And they gain the smell of the coral.

759
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
 So it means they can hide in the coral and no one can find them.

760
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 Wow.

761
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 So it's like if you were to eat something and you got the smell of it and then.

762
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 Yeah, then you like hide in a pizza shop.

763
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 No, no, no, no, no, no.

764
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show.

765
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 And that is my fact.

766
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 My fact this week is that the first female British playwright was called Joanna Lomley.

767
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 Yeah.

768
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 But it wasn't Joanna Lomley.

769
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 It was not the first British playwright.

770
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 As in, absolutely fabulous.

771
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 Yes.

772
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 It's not the current living Joanna Lomley.

773
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 No, this is from the 1500s.

774
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:09,000
 And the thing is is that her name in a lot of online and in books she'll be presented as Jane Lomley.

775
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 Yeah.

776
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 But actually so little is known about people from the 1500s.

777
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,000
 It's quite hard to establish if she was born Joanna or Jane, but definitely she was Joanna Lomley.

778
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 Yeah.

779
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
 And I just thought that was kind of cool.

780
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 I hadn't heard that before.

781
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 But she was a translator rather than a playwright.

782
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
 Yes.

783
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 And it wasn't even published or finished.

784
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 God, I love the olden days.

785
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 Everyone's dreams could come true.

786
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 It has since been published in 1909.

787
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 Yeah.

788
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 So it has made it to publication.

789
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 People do put it on in the UK as a play.

790
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 Yeah.

791
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 But she was a very interesting person.

792
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,000
 Obviously she couldn't publish stuff at the time because she was what is known as a woman.

793
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 And they were not keen.

794
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 No, thank you.

795
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 Not keen on them back then.

796
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 No.

797
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 They didn't allow them to do stuff like put out plays.

798
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
 So it's a shame because she was an extraordinary person.

799
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
 And yeah, she did this translation of.

800
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 Are you repeatees?

801
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 You're repeatees.

802
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 Yeah.

803
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 Yeah, I just thought that was quite cool.

804
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 Yeah.

805
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
 It was cool.

806
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 So because we were looking up Jane or Joanna Lomley, I looked up the first woman in the UK who wrote her own original play.

807
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
 And her name was Elizabeth Curry.

808
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
 And I love it.

809
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 It's called The Tragedy of Mariam.

810
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 Do you know what it's about?

811
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
 No.

812
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 Is it Robin Hood?

813
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 It isn't.

814
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
 How about Herod?

815
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
 She was Herod's second wife.

816
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
 She wanted to hear the synopsis of this play.

817
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 Is it a wife called Doris, didn't he?

818
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
 Yeah.

819
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 That would have been his first wife, I think.

820
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
 Or maybe third.

821
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 The spoiler alert.

822
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 It does not end well for Mariam.

823
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 Okay.

824
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 So this is full of spoilers.

825
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
 But basically, yeah.

826
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
 Spoilers for something written in 1613.

827
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 Yeah, I know.

828
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
 If you haven't seen it so far, I'm probably not going to see it now.

829
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 So basically, Herod, the great, his words.

830
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 Basically, the first four acts, everyone thinks that he's dead.

831
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
 And Mariam's like working out how she feels about him.

832
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
 Because she's like, oh, he did love me.

833
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
 He was a wonderful husband.

834
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
 But he also did kill my brother and granddad.

835
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
 And she's trying to work out what to do.

836
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 Because he's been merging everyone.

837
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 But then in that four, Herod returns.

838
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
 And he says to everyone, I'm not even dead.

839
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,000
 And then Salome says that Mariam was unfaithful even though she wasn't.

840
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
 And then Herod kills her.

841
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 The end.

842
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
 Oh.

843
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 Yeah.

844
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
 She's a long lead up of four acts of deliberation.

845
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
 Even though it's named after Mariam, she's only 10% of the time.

846
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 There's a lot of chorus work.

847
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
 Elizabeth Carey, very interesting person.

848
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,000
 She loved reading to the point where her parents had to ban anyone in the house

849
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 giving her candles at night so that she would stay up by candlelight reading reading book.

850
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
 So they were like, you have to start.

851
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
 And they were very encouraging her parents of her reading.

852
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 But only in dialogue.

853
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
 Yeah, only in dialogue.

854
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 You may just sleep.

855
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
 Yeah.

856
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
 And she was brilliant at languages.

857
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
 She spoke a bunch of languages, Spanish, Italian, Latin, Hebrew, Transylvanian.

858
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
 And this is my favorite fact.

859
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 It says that later on at the age of 10, so this is all before 10 years old.

860
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
 She learned these languages.

861
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:01,000
 She helped exonerate a woman who was accused of witchcraft after noticing that the accused lady

862
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,000
 was answering yes to every question she was asked without thinking about what she was being asked.

863
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 So at 10, she was like, she's just saying yes because you're asking her questions.

864
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
 You have no idea what you're talking about.

865
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
 And they said, you're right.

866
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
 She's exonerated.

867
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 She's not a witch.

868
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
 That's so interesting.

869
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
 Yes.

870
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:24,000
 So Afra Ben was a very influential, this is the latest tale.

871
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
 Yeah.

872
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
 And she's often who is attributed as the first.

873
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:33,000
 She was the first female player, but she was a very influential female player in the 17th century.

874
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
 And she was doubly cool because she was also a spy.

875
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:42,000
 One of the reasons that she wrote, or she wrote and then she gave it up for a while.

876
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:48,000
 And she took it up again partly to make a living because the government had not paid her for doing all the spying work that she had done.

877
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 But her stuff is really good.

878
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
 Yeah.

879
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
 Brilliant.

880
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
 I only said that because she's the only one of these three that I've read, stuff by.

881
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
 But during my English studies.

882
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
 Yeah, same here.

883
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
 And they said she was the first female player.

884
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
 They lied to us.

885
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
 They lied to us.

886
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
 Was it her own original play though?

887
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
 Yeah, they were.

888
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 Yeah, and she was a professional as well.

889
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
 Yeah, she made money and started.

890
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:16,000
 In a way, I don't want to give shit to my own fact, but I think she who you're just talking about has more of a claim to first female playwright.

891
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
 Well, hers is like an adapted screenplay.

892
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
 I think Carrie has claimed.

893
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
 I've never heard of Carrie before.

894
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
 Carrie is the forebend.

895
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
 Yeah, sorry.

896
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
 Well, because we were looking, I was looking up and I was interested in female first as a thing.

897
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
 Yeah.

898
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
 And so I looked on the Wikipedia list of female firsts.

899
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
 And I found out something so delightful.

900
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 Elizabeth Fible, in 1784, was the first woman to ride in a hot air balloon.

901
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
 How exciting.

902
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:46,000
 But in 1805, only 19 years later, Sophie Blanchard was the first woman to pilot a hot air balloon.

903
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:51,000
 So it took women 19 years to work out how to get them bring a passenger.

904
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
 So like, writing it.

905
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 So then I thought, well, this is so interesting, this Sophie Blanchard.

906
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 So basically, her husband was a hot air balloon pilot and he died.

907
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
 So she carried on his business and so she became a special one.

908
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 And the podium really liked her.

909
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,000
 And he gave her this title, "The Air and Naught of the Airfield Festival" or something.

910
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
 And then she died.

911
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
 Because she set up some fireworks.

912
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
 So fire to it.

913
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
 No, no.

914
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
 Hit a house and fell to the ground.

915
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
 And that's why we shouldn't let women do shit.

916
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
 They can't be trusted.

917
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
 All of this.

918
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
 So female playwrights and things.

919
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,000
 And even up until the time of Afroben, which is, you know, a long time after the first playwright,

920
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
 when women weren't allowed on stage.

921
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
 So it was all boys.

922
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:42,000
 But the reason that it was ended was because basically Charles II, when he was restored to the throne.

923
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
 Fancy dactresses.

924
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
 He fancied actresses.

925
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
 And he decreed what we have to do.

926
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:55,000
 Actually, I think the public will be outraged about boys appearing on stage in women's roles.

927
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
 And actually, no one really was outraged about it.

928
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
 But he said, no, it's completely outraged.

929
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,000
 We must, you know, legalize and make it compulsory for female roles to be played by women.

930
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
 And that's basically the only reason it happened.

931
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:11,000
 How could he, sorry if this is a very dumb common, how could he fancy actresses if the profession didn't exist?

932
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
 Because some things kind of happened.

933
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
 I mean, illegally.

934
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
 He fancy the idea of actresses.

935
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
 Right. Look at those boys.

936
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
 Imagine if those were real.

937
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:27,000
 So things happened illegally. But also in Shakespeare's time, some of the people who were credited with writing were women.

938
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
 Women did actually write things.

939
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
 It's just they didn't get their names on them.

940
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
 Yeah. So we read actually in one article.

941
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:39,000
 I don't know if this is true, but by the late 17th century, about third of plays staged in London were written by women.

942
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,000
 But it fell to around 7% in the early 18th century.

943
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:48,000
 And it stayed between 7% and 10% until the 1980s.

944
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
 Wow.

945
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
 Yeah. And it's so related to economics, actually.

946
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:59,000
 When you look at the ups and downs, women you have space and time, it's the whole Virginia Woolf thing, created just as much as men.

947
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,000
 Jane Austen, you know writing on tiny bits of paper.

948
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
 I went to see her desk the other day.

949
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
 I did.

950
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
 The British library.

951
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
 Yeah.

952
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
 And you just saw her maze.

953
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
 It's such a visual symbol of like this woman like in the corner.

954
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
 I don't know how long I can take up any room.

955
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
 Yeah.

956
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
 It's really tiny.

957
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
 It has her, her spectacles on it.

958
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
 Why is it an iPhone?

959
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
 It's so small.

960
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
 It's really, it's really small.

961
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
 She was a mouse.

962
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
 Yeah, she was a mouse lady.

963
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
 We Victoria was an Orca.

964
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
 Jane Austen was a mouse.

965
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
 My life was a carol.

966
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
 Are there any actual women, please?

967
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
 It's been a trick the entire time.

968
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:37,000
 Okay, that's it.

969
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
 That is all of our facts.

 It's called no such thing as a news.com.

983
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
 It has all of our previous topical TV shows series that we have started.

984
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
 It's not topical.

985
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
 That was last year.

986
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
 No, it's still going.

987
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
 Trump is still happening.

988
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
 You want to learn about Trump?

989
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
 That's all we spoke about.

990
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
 And it is on no such thing as the news.com.

991
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
 We will be back again next week with another episode.

992
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
 See you then.

993
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
 Goodbye.

994
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:29,000
 [Music]

995
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,580
 (upbeat music)
