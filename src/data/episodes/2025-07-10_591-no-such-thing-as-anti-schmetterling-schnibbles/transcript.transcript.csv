00:00:13,00:00:20,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:00:20,00:00:27,from three undisclosed locations around the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber and the reason we are
00:00:27,00:00:33,three today is Anna is on holiday so I am joined by Andrew Hunts and Murray and James Harkin and
00:00:33,00:00:38,once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven
00:00:38,00:00:45,days and in no particular order here we go. Starting with fact number one that is Andy.
00:00:45,00:00:50,My fact is that scientists are trying to save water voles by feeding them glitter.
00:00:50,00:00:58,Yes. I thought plastic was bad for the environment. Well yes they're not feeding them plastic and not
00:00:58,00:01:01,only feeding them plastic it's not like they're just shoveling glitter into these poor voles.
00:01:01,00:01:05,Basically they're very endangered water voles in the UK. If you've never if you're listening from
00:01:05,00:01:10,outside the UK we have these charming little things. Ratty from Wind of the Willows is actually a
00:01:10,00:01:14,water vol is not a rat but they're really really endangered for various reasons and so conservationists
00:01:14,00:01:20,are now trying to track them work out where they are. They're quite hard to track because they're
00:01:20,00:01:25,quite elusive. We normally track them by looking for their poo but obviously hard to find like a
00:01:25,00:01:31,small poo on a riverbank. As the old saying goes it's like looking for a poo on a riverbank.
00:01:31,00:01:36,And so they're feeding them this edible like sort of biodegradable glitter the kind that you get on
00:01:36,00:01:42,cakes and things like that so not plastic. I suppose yeah I suppose it's kind of useful because
00:01:42,00:01:47,even if you find a poo on a riverbank you don't know who it belongs to. It could be a mouse
00:01:47,00:01:53,or a vole or a fisherman or whatever you just. But voles are very organised with their poo.
00:01:53,00:01:58,They have actual toilets so I think to an educated eye you would know immediately you're
00:01:58,00:02:04,staring at a water vol poo. Yeah and they are on the decline aren't they Andy? It's 90%
00:02:04,00:02:08,down at the end of the 20th century than what we had before. So what they're doing now they're
00:02:08,00:02:14,feeding them glitter. They've been experimenting on captive voles to see if these produce extra
00:02:14,00:02:20,sparkly poos which will be easier to spot. And the experiment very pleased report has worked
00:02:20,00:02:28,24 hours later as the Beeb report put it a tiny glittery poo was spotted. So look out for that
00:02:28,00:02:33,on the riverbank near you. It's quite cool as well they seem to be able to differentiate between
00:02:33,00:02:38,different families of voles with quite an easy way do you know? Different coloured glitter.
00:02:38,00:02:42,Different coloured glitter so you know one family might have silver poo and then you've got
00:02:42,00:02:45,another with gold poo down there and that's how they can differentiate who's packed together
00:02:45,00:02:50,and where they're going. That's going to become a status symbol in the water vol world isn't it?
00:02:50,00:02:53,It's like the silver poos are not going to hang out with the gold poos anymore.
00:02:53,00:02:57,We'd like to invite you to join our platinum poo club.
00:02:57,00:03:05,Here's an interesting problem with this study I think that if you're trying to count
00:03:05,00:03:11,water vol poos to count the number of water voles there is a problem because water voles
00:03:11,00:03:17,tend to eat poo. Not only that they often eat or they sometimes eat poo directly from the Edis
00:03:17,00:03:23,so don't it's not like you have a bit of time to find it before it gets eaten.
00:03:23,00:03:27,Guys have a little respect. Have a little self respect. That's too keen isn't it? That's a bit
00:03:27,00:03:34,too keen. It's too keen. That's sticking your mouth under Mr Whippy's ice cream machine isn't it
00:03:34,00:03:40,before it hits the cone. They have these latrines where they all go and so they
00:03:40,00:03:44,but there's another method that was pitched to find them in 2020 because it is really hard to
00:03:44,00:03:48,find them because they're on the river banks and so on. It's just hard to survey especially steep
00:03:48,00:03:53,river banks which was giving them floating toilets so they were given these rafts made of
00:03:53,00:03:59,floating polystyrene and the idea is they'll think that is a terrific loo. I must use that
00:03:59,00:04:03,little floating platform as a loo. It only works if they don't have fantastic loos already.
00:04:03,00:04:07,If they've already got a great loo setup then they won't use your platform.
00:04:07,00:04:12,Yeah they've set those up largely because you can't walk around looking for water voles. You
00:04:12,00:04:17,often mess the local environment up so if you ever see a platform look around you might see
00:04:17,00:04:22,a bunch of men with binoculars sort of honing in on the little platform.
00:04:22,00:04:27,They're not perverts. We're not perverts. You'll see them and you'll think what a bunch of perverts
00:04:27,00:04:32,but actually they're looking at water vol poo. They're heroes. They're conservation heroes.
00:04:32,00:04:35,Yeah it's better than the old way. So an old way of doing it was you would put
00:04:35,00:04:41,radio colors on your voles and you can kind of track them that way. But they found that when
00:04:41,00:04:50,you did that there would be way more male voles born and that's because a female vol who is stressed
00:04:50,00:04:54,will give birth to males and that's like an evolutionary thing because when you know when
00:04:54,00:04:59,your population is under threat you need more males. So what they found is that when the females
00:04:59,00:05:03,were wearing these radio colors there were just way more males born.
00:05:03,00:05:07,Is that why I have so many boys? Fenella was so stressed during all the three pregnancies.
00:05:07,00:05:10,"It's not. It's certainly during the conception I think she must have been, yeah."
00:05:10,00:05:17,Have you been talking to her? How do you know that?
00:05:17,00:05:24,Can we talk about mink? Can we please talk about the American mink?
00:05:25,00:05:32,Oh okay. I wasn't expecting pushback on that. What is a mink? Like as in is it a vol?
00:05:32,00:05:36,"Do you see the big sort of jacket, the big coat that Andy's wearing at the moment?"
00:05:36,00:05:44,Very flush color. It's perfect for this 31 degree heat that we're living in London at the moment.
00:05:44,00:05:48,Pure mink. The mink really wicks away the sweat.
00:05:48,00:05:54,It goes really nicely with the dismembered polar bear head you're wearing as a hat as well.
00:05:55,00:06:00,"Okay guys. So basically when Kenneth Graham wrote ""Wind of the Willows"" and wrote ""Ratty"""
00:06:00,00:06:04,there were loads of water vols all over the UK. Then in the last hundred years one of the main
00:06:04,00:06:08,"problems, like there's a little bit of climate and a little bit of habitat stuff, the main problem"
00:06:08,00:06:14,seems to be goddamn American mink coming over here eating our vols. They were farmed in the UK
00:06:14,00:06:19,for ages. There used to be hundreds of mink farms everywhere and obviously some of them escaped and
00:06:19,00:06:24,"blah blah blah and they bred and the main problem is right if a water vols hole looks like this,"
00:06:24,00:06:27,"I'm just holding up my hands for Dan and James here, it's like this size right?"
00:06:27,00:06:31,"When you say water vols hole, you mean the hole to the house where they live?"
00:06:31,00:06:35,"I apologize. Yeah, if a water vols hole was this size you'd spot the poos a lot more easily."
00:06:35,00:06:42,"Like an owl comes down, obviously an owl can't get through this spot, it's just not possible,"
00:06:42,00:06:48,"but a mink is basically like a furry drainpipe, like it's perfect. It's the right size to just get"
00:06:48,00:06:52,into the burrow and they have no defences against them so they can just be eaten like dozens and
00:06:52,00:06:57,"dozens. A mink can just dispatch dozens of vols basically, it's a big problem, but basically"
00:06:57,00:07:01,"they've worked out now they need to eradicate mink from England, you know, because there are an"
00:07:01,00:07:06,"invasive species and they've done a trial where they've eradicated them from 5% of England,"
00:07:06,00:07:10,"which is quite big when you think about it. So get this, I just love how this trap works."
00:07:10,00:07:15,"James you'll love this, you get a hollow golf ball. Okay, a bit of a waste of a golf ball."
00:07:15,00:07:20,"Is it like a training golf ball that you ever get those? Oh, you can get those little plastic"
00:07:20,00:07:24,"ones with holes in. I think it's like that. So you get that, you put that inside the trap"
00:07:24,00:07:30,and inside that hollow golf ball is a cigarette filter containing one or two drops from the
00:07:30,00:07:34,"minks anal scent gland, which you have harvested. This is getting better and better for me."
00:07:34,00:07:43,"Cigarette filters, anal glands, golf balls. This is like my luxury items when I go on"
00:07:43,00:07:50,"desert island desks. So you've harvested the anal gland droplets from your previous,"
00:07:50,00:07:54,the last mink you caught. So it's a very sustainable system. So you put them in the
00:07:54,00:07:58,"cigarette filter, you drip it on, and then you just set a mink to catch a mink basically,"
00:07:58,00:08:02,"and then the trap door closes when the mink goes in, and the trappers then get an email"
00:08:02,00:08:05,"saying you have caught one mink, and then they could just go and kill the mink basically."
00:08:05,00:08:11,"That system of using the holes for them to burrow through is also another way, by the way,"
00:08:11,00:08:16,that they've been trying to monitor and work out how many voles are out there. So
00:08:16,00:08:22,they get a tube and they will pad it up all the way on the inside with sticky tape.
00:08:22,00:08:27,"So when the water vol goes through, bits of hair get stuck into the hole,"
00:08:27,00:08:30,"and then they can look inside and go up. Yeah, there's been a vol."
00:08:30,00:08:34,Does it not strip off its fur? Comes out completely naked. It's not
00:08:34,00:08:39,"effective way of doing it really. Actually, that's a good way to make the mink coats."
00:08:39,00:08:41,Just get them going through that tunnel. Jesus.
00:08:41,00:08:44,"Collect the hair. I just want to say for the listener,"
00:08:44,00:08:48,"just in case you didn't get it that it was a joke earlier, Andy is not wearing any animal products"
00:08:48,00:08:57,"today. No, my underpants are fur, but you weren't to know that. You know who stopped mink in the UK?"
00:08:57,00:09:02,"Well. Because there used to be hundreds and hundreds of farms, and they were mostly farming"
00:09:02,00:09:05,"them for their fur. It was pretty cruel, actually. It wasn't that nice."
00:09:05,00:09:09,"It's an MP, it's a current MP, actually, who's got a really appropriate name, Labour MP."
00:09:09,00:09:14,"Oh, okay. This is tough."
00:09:14,00:09:16,"I'm going to tell you, it's Maria Eagle."
00:09:16,00:09:23,"That was gettable. If we'd have sat here for four and a half, well, let's say Anna's here,"
00:09:23,00:09:27,"three and a half hours, because she's good on MPs. I reckon we could have got that."
00:09:27,00:09:32,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. So that's cool. And she basically had a private member's bill,"
00:09:32,00:09:37,where she got them cancelled. And then animal rights people would free thousands and thousands
00:09:37,00:09:41,of mink. They'd break into the mink farms. And then in one of the stupid... They were being kept
00:09:41,00:09:46,"in very cruel conditions, but the answer is not to release thousands of incredibly dangerous carnivores"
00:09:46,00:09:51,into the local environment. I've mostly got mink stuff for this fact.
00:09:51,00:09:55,"I must say, Andy, due to the fact that this fact was about water bowls and glitter,"
00:09:55,00:09:57,my mink material is quite scabbed.
00:09:58,00:10:03,"I'm not so hot on it either, though I am excited for your new quiz show, where a single question"
00:10:03,00:10:08,requires three and a half hours of guesswork before we get to the answer.
00:10:08,00:10:11,Can I say a thing about glittery poo before we move on?
00:10:11,00:10:16,Tardigrades sometimes have glittery poo. Do you know what a tardigrade is?
00:10:16,00:10:20,Like these tiny little... They're known as water bears as well. They live in water.
00:10:20,00:10:25,They're kind of ubiquitous. They live everywhere you look. They're kind of indestructible.
00:10:25,00:10:29,"If you fire radioactivity at them, they don't die. If they go into space, they don't die."
00:10:29,00:10:34,They're like superhero animals. But these tiny little minuscule bugs.
00:10:34,00:10:39,"But they found some with glitter in their poo, and they wondered where on earth did they get it from."
00:10:39,00:10:41,And it turns out that they probably swallowed their own mouth.
00:10:41,00:10:47,That's because they have these kind of crystal-like teeth in their mouth called psilots.
00:10:47,00:10:53,They used to grind little bits of invertebrates. And then every now and then they molt.
00:10:53,00:10:58,"But usually, the teeth would just go out onto the floor. But sometimes they accidentally eat"
00:10:58,00:11:01,their own teeth. And then they end up with really glittery poo.
00:11:01,00:11:02,Wow.
00:11:02,00:11:04,You can swallow teeth. I've swallowed teeth before.
00:11:04,00:11:05,What?
00:11:05,00:11:06,No.
00:11:06,00:11:10,"I'm sure I swallowed my first tooth. Like my first tooth that ever came out, my first milk tooth."
00:11:10,00:11:13,I'm sure I accidentally thought the hell of a story if it was someone else's.
00:11:13,00:11:20,I'll tell you what. Hell of a story for the tooth fairy who has to go sipping your shit afterwards to give you 50p.
00:11:21,00:11:25,It has to go under my pillow. This is not good. No one wins.
00:11:25,00:11:31,"Oh, little Andy, what's happened to your bed? No, no, no. Let me explain. I swallowed my tooth."
00:11:31,00:11:35,"Just normally when you shit the bed, you shit it further down. That's the problem."
00:11:35,00:11:40,"Like, it's a bad old night when it ends up under the pillow."
00:11:40,00:11:45,"The word glitter comes from the Vikings. That's cool, isn't it? You wouldn't think that."
00:11:45,00:11:46,No.
00:11:46,00:11:50,"But it just meant something that shines or shimmers. And obviously, Vikings went on the sea a lot."
00:11:50,00:11:53,And the sea shimmers a lot. So they use the word glitter to mean that.
00:11:53,00:11:57,"And then obviously, glitter, as we know it today, came in the 20th century."
00:11:57,00:12:00,Yeah. Glitter has its foundations in New Jersey.
00:12:00,00:12:03,And that's where most of the glitter is made these days.
00:12:03,00:12:07,"And there's a company who I think are the second largest company called Glitterx,"
00:12:07,00:12:12,who gave an interview to the New York Times. And it's insane the protection.
00:12:12,00:12:16,It's as if they're protecting KFC's secret ingredients or Coca-Cola.
00:12:16,00:12:19,They won't show any journalists how their glitter is made.
00:12:19,00:12:21,They won't let them hear how it is made.
00:12:21,00:12:26,"It's crazy. It's a really crazy article. The journalist, she asks,"
00:12:26,00:12:29,"""Who is the biggest market in the world for glitter products?"""
00:12:29,00:12:32,Expecting it's going to be something like Carnival or whatever.
00:12:32,00:12:34,"And they say, ""We can't tell you that."""
00:12:34,00:12:38,"And she says, ""Why not?"" And they say, ""We can't tell you why not."
00:12:38,00:12:40,"Let's just leave it at that, shall we?"""
00:12:40,00:12:43,Interesting. I think it's the US Air Force.
00:12:43,00:12:44,It's going to be military.
00:12:44,00:12:48,It's because they have things called chaff tubes.
00:12:48,00:12:54,And this is a thing where they fire out tiny little bits of glitter out of the aeroplanes.
00:12:54,00:12:57,"So if you've got a missile that is kind of locked onto you with radar,"
00:12:57,00:13:02,"fire a lot of glitter out, then the radar kind of gets confused and the missile endures."
00:13:02,00:13:08,It's quite a sort of fabulous way of like winning an air war.
00:13:08,00:13:10,"You know what I mean? Like it's quite showbiz, you know."
00:13:10,00:13:13,"You've got a mig on your ass, ghost sparkle mode."
00:13:14,00:13:15,I like that.
00:13:15,00:13:18,It's possible they don't want to say because it's used for stopping counter-fitting.
00:13:18,00:13:22,"So in the same way they're using it on water voles so that they can monitor where they are,"
00:13:22,00:13:29,companies like big manufacturers of plywood will have tiny bits of glitter inserted inside.
00:13:29,00:13:29,So that it's...
00:13:29,00:13:33,"Oh yeah, because I'm always getting my counterfeit plywood."
00:13:33,00:13:37,"I'm always going to the plywood shop and going, ""This isn't the real stuff."""
00:13:37,00:13:41,"Have you got anything, got any cheaper plywood under the counter for me, mate? Maybe?"
00:13:41,00:13:43,"What do you think the counter's made of, mate?"
00:13:43,00:13:52,"Yeah, absolutely. It's used in so many different products just to stop global counter-fitting."
00:13:52,00:13:53,That's so funny.
00:13:53,00:13:57,"Yeah, and then just really quickly it was invented by Henry F. Ruschmann,"
00:13:57,00:14:01,"who was a German immigrant who was coming to New York on a boat in 1926,"
00:14:01,00:14:07,and he was hired as soon as he got off the boat because the captain of the ship noticed
00:14:07,00:14:11,that he was a brilliant machinist and he went straight to the guy who was the
00:14:11,00:14:16,"charge of the Westinghouse Company, which is like a big electronics company at the time,"
00:14:16,00:14:17,"and said, ""You've got to hire this man."""
00:14:17,00:14:23,So the guy literally walked off the ship and straight into a job and he worked on the machine
00:14:23,00:14:27,"that cuts out. You know, like if you take photos and you might get a big reel of photos,"
00:14:27,00:14:33,you need to cut them into smaller photos. He worked on one of those machines and then he noticed
00:14:33,00:14:38,he had lots of little bits of plastic left over and that they shined in the light and he called
00:14:38,00:14:42,"them ""Schnibbles"". Wow. It's just kind of an accident. That's discovery, Andy."
00:14:42,00:14:49,"Was it? Was it now? Yeah, that's it. I prefer ""Schnibbles"". I think that's a great name."
00:14:49,00:14:52,"Guys, I'm so sorry. I have one more thing to say on voles, but it's important."
00:14:52,00:14:57,It's actually important. There's a group in South London who are involved in the
00:14:57,00:15:02,vol reintroduction thing. They're called Citizen Zoo and they have a scheme called Get Involved.
00:15:03,00:15:09,It's better written down. And one thing you can do is you can make a small donation and you can
00:15:09,00:15:16,name some water voles. So very pleased to announce that I've made a small donation of company money.
00:15:16,00:15:23,"All right, not your own money. Because remember when we sponsored that explosive finding rattle"
00:15:23,00:15:28,"whenever it was? That was my own money that paid for that. It wasn't your money. Oh, okay. Well,"
00:15:28,00:15:34,"I thought you guys would want to be in on this. So I will be, I will be invoicing. Anyway, there are"
00:15:34,00:15:45,"now two voles somewhere in South London called Everard and Digby. Oh, yeah. Perfect."
00:15:45,00:15:57,"Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is James. Okay, my fact this week is that"
00:15:57,00:16:04,"according to Tongan mythology, the island of Cow was almost stolen one night. But the god"
00:16:04,00:16:12,Tafakula bent over and the light shone out of his anus so brightly that the thieves fled in fear.
00:16:12,00:16:19,The classic manoeuvre. So I was reading an article in Live Science about a volcano that
00:16:19,00:16:24,went off in the Pacific last year. And the headline was Shining Anus Volcano in Tonga
00:16:24,00:16:31,"coughs up cloud of smoke during a recent eruption. And obviously, that kind of caught my eye a little"
00:16:31,00:16:40,"bit. So I read this article and it said that this island called Tafua, it's got like a ring,"
00:16:40,00:16:45,"almost like the top's been cut off. And there's a ring and there's a lake inside it. And then nearby,"
00:16:45,00:16:50,there's another volcano that looks like a perfect triangle. And the story goes that there were
00:16:50,00:16:57,"three deities called Tuvavata, Sisi and Fangar. And they were going to steal Tafua. So they came"
00:16:57,00:17:03,"and they tore off the top of the mountain. And when they tore it off, a lake appeared. But then"
00:17:03,00:17:09,"this Tongan god Tafakula came along, the bent over showed his anus, it shone so brightly. They were"
00:17:09,00:17:16,"struck with fear. They threw the top of the mountain in the air, it landed and became this other island."
00:17:16,00:17:22,"And that's how the two islands sort of came to be. And then in life science, the final sentence"
00:17:22,00:17:27,"says, ""It is unclear from the account why Tafakula's anus shone like the sun."""
00:17:27,00:17:34,"Okay. Well, so this story was taken from a book that was written by a man called Edward Winslow"
00:17:34,00:17:39,"Gifford. And it was published in 1924, all about Tongan myths and tales. And there's quite a few,"
00:17:39,00:17:45,it's all oral tradition told to this guy. And he noted it down. And there's about five or six
00:17:45,00:17:52,different versions. Sounds more like anal tradition. Hey. So there's a bunch of different stories in
00:17:52,00:17:59,this book. And he writes down the different interpretations that are given. And one of the
00:17:59,00:18:05,"things that is mentioned in one of the stories is that his name itself, Tafakula, is, no, I'm not"
00:18:05,00:18:12,"going to stop laughing, Andy. I'm pressing on. His name is Tafakula. And his name translates"
00:18:12,00:18:21,as red edges. And it says he had a red anus. So it's quite possible that just the anus itself
00:18:21,00:18:26,"was so red, brightly red, that it was mistook for the light. So we have a partial explanation."
00:18:26,00:18:30,"The song ""Roxanne"" by the police was actually originally called Tafakula. You don't have to"
00:18:30,00:18:37,"put on the red light. No, please. Tafakula is fine. The cavity search is over. Wow."
00:18:38,00:18:43,"I mean, it's just a story, I guess. But it's quite an amusing story. And I think quite a lot of"
00:18:43,00:18:49,"Pacific cultures have origin myths, which have parts of the body in them. A slightly different"
00:18:49,00:18:56,"to the ones that we might have. So in Hawaiian culture, there's a goddess called Kohe Kohe Lele,"
00:18:56,00:19:02,"whose name translates as Kapo with a traveling vagina. And there is a crater on Oahu,"
00:19:03,00:19:09,"which is named after her vulva. And the idea is that Pili, who's the goddess of volcanoes,"
00:19:09,00:19:15,"she was being attacked by a shapeshifting man with a pig's head. And then Kapo came along,"
00:19:15,00:19:22,lured the attacker away by throwing her vagina onto Oahu. He ran away from Pili. She managed to
00:19:22,00:19:33,"escape and the vagina became this crater. She threw her hua onto Oahu? She did. Sorry, I didn't"
00:19:33,00:19:40,listen to anything else you were saying. I'm so excited to have realised that. What a move.
00:19:40,00:19:44,What a move. Yeah. Wow. I had a bit of a scan through the Tongan myths and tales to see if there
00:19:44,00:19:50,were any other stories that involved anuses. And I could only find one other. And it's to do with
00:19:50,00:19:56,"a tale of an island called Uwa, E-U-A, Uwa. And there was a great warrior called Totaki."
00:19:56,00:20:03,"And basically, he had all of his wife's relations killed. Really bad move, really annoyed her."
00:20:03,00:20:08,"She decided that she was going to kill him. And so her method was she met him on top of a mountain,"
00:20:08,00:20:14,"brought up a coconut, half a coconut full of water, but she only filled it halfway through. So"
00:20:14,00:20:18,"as he drank it, he had to lift it right up to get all of the water in. And when he did that,"
00:20:18,00:20:22,she pushed him off the edge. He managed to grab her and they both plummeted to their deaths.
00:20:22,00:20:27,"She fell to the ground. But unfortunately, he got snagged on a tree on the way down,"
00:20:27,00:20:31,where the branch went right through his anus and came up out on the other side.
00:20:31,00:20:37,"And a bunch of warriors who were coming to back up the wife saw him sort of levitating in the air,"
00:20:37,00:20:40,looking incredibly intimidating and fled off the island because they thought he'd reached
00:20:40,00:20:47,"sort of like God level status in his anger. A lot of stories, right? They have a kind of"
00:20:47,00:20:51,"meaning to them. Like Esau was fable to have a really clear, slow and steady wins the race."
00:20:51,00:20:58,What is the meaning of this story? I'm not entirely sure. But there is still a cave on
00:20:58,00:21:02,that cliff face where it's said to has happened that is called Tootaki named after him.
00:21:02,00:21:06,Don't attack women. Is that the motto of the story? Is it a good motto?
00:21:06,00:21:11,What about the motto being even in the worst of situations when you've got a tree impaling your
00:21:11,00:21:16,"anus and you just died, some good can come of it? That's a really nice message, actually."
00:21:16,00:21:22,"That's a really good message. Or the flip side is to the warriors. If your opponent looks intimidating,"
00:21:22,00:21:25,double check that he's not actually impaled through the anus by a stick.
00:21:25,00:21:29,Really good. Tonga for a lot of people might seem as if it's just one place. It's not a bunch of
00:21:29,00:21:36,"islands. It's down in the Pacific. It's about 170 islands gathered under this one sovereignty, right?"
00:21:36,00:21:40,"And James, have you been there? I've always been thinking this is a James Harkin place."
00:21:40,00:21:45,I haven't been to any in the South Pacific. The Empire of Tonga at one stage spanned more than
00:21:45,00:21:52,"a thousand miles, which made it about the same size as the Zulu Empire and the Aztec empires."
00:21:52,00:21:55,"Pretty good. Of course. Well, for Tonga, most of it was ocean."
00:21:55,00:22:01,"So it's a little bit less useful to have a huge empire if most of it's the ocean, I guess."
00:22:01,00:22:06,"Yeah, that's sort of cheating. Tonga was originally known as the Friendly Islands."
00:22:06,00:22:13,And that was after Captain James Cook arrived there in 1773 and he arrived during a festival
00:22:13,00:22:17,and he was invited to join in and he thought their locals were so friendly that he should
00:22:17,00:22:23,"call it the Friendly Islands. Unknown to him, apparently the reason that they didn't kill him"
00:22:23,00:22:25,because the chiefs could not agree on a plan on how to kill him.
00:22:25,00:22:33,"Purochistry. Amazing. So good. Are they all standing around a diagram of different ways,"
00:22:33,00:22:39,like angles of attack and things like that? One of them's holding a spear. One of them's holding
00:22:39,00:22:46,"a tree that he might put up as anus. What's on the board, guys? Oh,"
00:22:46,00:22:51,"nothing. Don't worry about it. Just go back to the festival. This is a restricted bit, actually."
00:22:51,00:22:58,"Yeah, I visited his house when we were on tour, Captain Cook. Oh, that's right."
00:22:58,00:23:02,"It's in Melbourne and they brought over the entire house to Melbourne. In fact,"
00:23:02,00:23:07,it's a house he never lived in. It was his parents' house. So it's a slightly confusing place.
00:23:07,00:23:13,But a good afternoon out. There you go. I was looking into some more of the weird
00:23:13,00:23:19,"sort of moments throughout the history of the Tonga Empire. And for a three-year period,"
00:23:19,00:23:26,"the king of Tonga was a piece of wood. So basically what had happened was the king,"
00:23:26,00:23:32,"Talatama, had passed away and he had no children. And so this broke the line and this has happened"
00:23:32,00:23:38,"in the past where it then goes to another clan and so on. And the brother of Talatama thought,"
00:23:38,00:23:45,this can't happen. So he created a piece of wood that was painted and a bit shaped like a doll and
00:23:45,00:23:50,"said, this is the new king. And so the new king was put onto the throne and then the new king"
00:23:50,00:23:57,after a while was given a wife. It sounds like it was a real human as opposed to a piece of wood
00:23:57,00:24:02,because they don't mention it's a wooden wife. And then the piece of wood died
00:24:02,00:24:10,after three years. But it left a son with the wife and that was the brother. And then he took control.
00:24:10,00:24:17,"Yes. How does a piece of wood die? Well, how does an anus radiate light? There are lots of"
00:24:17,00:24:22,"questions in the Tongan world that we don't have the answers to. You know, this is back in the 12th"
00:24:22,00:24:29,century. So this sits in that world of myth and legend. But it is a story that is known there.
00:24:29,00:24:33,So the brother was trying to create an opportunity for himself to become king.
00:24:33,00:24:38,"Yeah. So he creates a sort of cosy father figure in this piece of wood, marries it to some poor"
00:24:38,00:24:42,"woman, then she has a baby who happens to be the guy who wanted to be the king in the first place."
00:24:42,00:24:49,"Is that it? It's exactly that. Yeah. Very nice, skillful. Do they have to do a paternity test?"
00:24:49,00:24:53,"No, they don't. You don't look anything like him. You haven't got his knots."
00:24:56,00:24:59,Are you guys familiar with the practice of perineum sunning?
00:24:59,00:25:07,"Jesus. Well, I mean, is it exactly what it sounds like? It's exactly what it sounds like."
00:25:07,00:25:13,"And it's to do with the claim that if you get 30 seconds of sunlight directly on your bottom,"
00:25:13,00:25:18,"I mean, right, right in there, it's the equivalent. This is the claim that's made. Okay. It's the"
00:25:18,00:25:23,"equivalent of a full day of sunlight with your clothes on now. Okay, that's useful to know."
00:25:23,00:25:27,"Does that work with tanning boots as well? Well, it's very hard to get your legs up in"
00:25:27,00:25:32,"the booth, isn't it? But surely they can direct a beam just straight in."
00:25:32,00:25:40,"Well, don't do it, basically. You might get sunburned. You've got quite thin skin down there."
00:25:40,00:25:47,Don't do it. Please don't do it. This fact was about a light putting off burglars.
00:25:49,00:25:55,"Do you think lights put off burglars or not? Yes. Yeah. Well, you might be wrong."
00:25:55,00:26:02,"Oh, interesting. So there have been various studies done. There was one at the University of"
00:26:02,00:26:06,"Loughborough that found that if you have a burglar alarm with a light, you're more likely to be"
00:26:06,00:26:12,burgled. But they're not sure. It might be because burglar alarms are put in places that are more
00:26:12,00:26:18,likely to be burgled anyway. And so that's why it happens. But there was also a study at London
00:26:18,00:26:25,"School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, weirdly, at UCL, and they found that when you turn the"
00:26:25,00:26:31,"street lights off between midnight and 5am, there are a lot less cars broken into in a certain area."
00:26:31,00:26:36,"And that's, they think, because it might make it more difficult to see if there are any valuable"
00:26:36,00:26:43,goods in your car. And they might get scared. It's spooky being out of the dark. Yeah.
00:26:44,00:26:48,It is. Yeah. And there's... I've got one of these security lights. And we're saying that maybe I
00:26:48,00:26:54,"should turn it off. Well, there was a study in 2019 that found correlations between light levels"
00:26:54,00:27:00,"and unsafe places. And what they found is that when you have the lights on in a certain area,"
00:27:00,00:27:06,that means there's almost more dark places for people to hide. Do you know what I mean? Because
00:27:06,00:27:10,"the contrast between the light and dark is more. So you're walking around the light bit,"
00:27:10,00:27:14,"you think everything's fine, but there are going to be some dark areas where people can hide."
00:27:14,00:27:17,"Whereas if it's always dark, your eyes will be more accustomed than you'd be able to see things."
00:27:17,00:27:22,"So basically the journey's out a little bit, I think. Okay. That's interesting. That's like,"
00:27:22,00:27:27,"you know, the classic movies where prison guards have that one beam of light that they look for"
00:27:27,00:27:33,"escaping prisoners going around. And they're always in the dark. That, what you're saying is that"
00:27:33,00:27:38,"kind of impedes the hunt that they should turn it off. Don't worry, guys. I know what I'm doing."
00:27:38,00:27:43,"I've read a study from the University of Lafra, which insists that if we turn off the lights,"
00:27:43,00:27:48,then it'll be safer. Dan caught in the middle of the prison yard with his pants wrapped in ankles
00:27:48,00:27:51,"going, ""I thought there were some medical benefits."""
00:27:51,00:27:58,"Not trying to escape, just trying to get my 30 seconds of daily sun."
00:27:58,00:27:59,"It's midnight, Shriver."
00:28:06,00:28:13,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact. My fact this week is that for over 20"
00:28:13,00:28:19,"years now, fans of the Doctor Who actor Tom Baker have been regularly visiting his gravestone at a"
00:28:19,00:28:23,"cemetery in Kent, despite the fact that he isn't yet dead."
00:28:23,00:28:33,"Yeah, so this is, I found this out in a brilliant autobiography that Tom Baker wrote many years"
00:28:33,00:28:38,"ago called ""Who on Earth is Tom Baker?"" I started on the final chapter, which is where I found it."
00:28:38,00:28:46,"So Tom Baker, many years ago, was living in a little town in Kent called Borton Malherb,"
00:28:46,00:28:49,"and he lived in a house that was directly opposite a church, St. Nicholas's Church,"
00:28:49,00:28:55,"and he used to go and do his bit for the community. He would mow the grass in front of the church,"
00:28:55,00:29:02,"and he decided this is where I want to be buried. So he paid for a plot, but it seemed that there"
00:29:02,00:29:07,was a deal that you could get a headstone at the same time. So he bought one. So it is engraved
00:29:07,00:29:14,"Tom Baker, 1934 too, and then a blank space that will one day be filled in. It's all moldy,"
00:29:14,00:29:21,"it's got muscle over it, it's weather beaten, and people come and visit it. And quite often,"
00:29:21,00:29:26,"back in the day when Tom Baker was still living there, he would often pop up behind the people who"
00:29:26,00:29:32,"were looking at him. Surely he's not going to die, he's just going to turn into Peter Davidson,"
00:29:32,00:29:38,"isn't he? Yes, that is. That's a little Doctor Who joke for anyone who's ever watched Doctor Who,"
00:29:38,00:29:44,"which is not me. Yeah, so here's, we should point out the connection properly, Doctor Who. So Tom"
00:29:44,00:29:49,Baker was the fourth Doctor. He was the longest serving Doctor in all of Doctor Who's history.
00:29:49,00:29:54,"So he's kind of more associated as the Doctor than most of the other ones. I'm just going to tell you,"
00:29:54,00:29:58,"because he is quite a quirky character, and I'll just give you a little bit of insight into how"
00:29:58,00:30:03,weird he is in this final chapter in the book when he talks about it. The story that he uses to tell
00:30:03,00:30:09,"the story is that he's mowing outside the church and there's a man standing there, and the man says,"
00:30:09,00:30:15,"""Oh, hello,"" and he makes a point about his mower, his lawn mower. He says, ""Oh, it's very nice,"""
00:30:15,00:30:19,"and he's acting all weird, and Tom doesn't know what's going on, and he goes to bed that night,"
00:30:19,00:30:24,"and then two men in balaclavas break into his house, and they start searching for stuff, and Tom"
00:30:24,00:30:29,"Baker doesn't know what, and he's petrified, and they call the police, and it's a traumatic experience."
00:30:29,00:30:34,"The next morning, he goes down and he sees his tombstone, and it now no longer just says Tom"
00:30:34,00:30:41,"Baker in 1934 to, and then blank, it now says Tom Baker in 1934 to wanker, and someone's just written"
00:30:41,00:30:47,"that in chalk on it, and so he rubs that off using some grass cuttings and some sheep feces that he"
00:30:47,00:30:51,"finds and sort of takes that off. What is the story, Dan? What is the story? The point is that this"
00:30:51,00:30:57,is the mind of Tom Baker. He becomes convinced that the balaclava people were there to get his
00:30:57,00:31:02,"lawn mower, so he moves his lawn mower up into his room, and he sleeps with it every night alongside"
00:31:02,00:31:07,"an axe that sits on his bed in case they come back in, and it's not so he can kill them, it's so he"
00:31:07,00:31:12,can chop his own head off before they get a chance to do it. That's Tom Baker in a nutshell. That's
00:31:12,00:31:17,"the final chapter in his book. Wow. I mean, Dan, can I just say you just waved a copy of the book"
00:31:17,00:31:24,at us. I've got a library copy of the book here. Yeah. Who on earth is Tom Baker? I started at
00:31:24,00:31:29,"chapter one like a dweeb. The first words of chapter one are, because he's got this amazing"
00:31:29,00:31:34,"voice, hasn't he? He's got a very, very recognizable voice. My first ambition was to be an orphan,"
00:31:34,00:31:38,"and it sort of, you know, and it's because he was growing up in the war in Liverpool,"
00:31:38,00:31:42,"and apparently if you became orphaned, you would get presents from the Americans, which I did not"
00:31:42,00:31:46,"think was a scheme they ran, but whatever. Yeah, they just, they were handed out binks, weren't they?"
00:31:46,00:31:52,"Left, right, and centre. So he writes, the only drawback was that to qualify for the goodies,"
00:31:52,00:31:57,"your mam had to be in heaven, so I prayed hard that a bomb would drop on mine as she trudged home"
00:31:57,00:32:04,"from the Sefton Arms. He's got a very weird anecdote style. But he's a hero, isn't he, to a lot of"
00:32:04,00:32:10,"people in this country. If you're overseas, Tom Baker, a household name, he certainly was. He"
00:32:10,00:32:17,"certainly has a kind of higher status in the nerd world, but he's old. He's, you know, born in 34,"
00:32:17,00:32:23,so he hasn't been on TV for a long time. Did he do the voiceover for Little Britain? Was that him?
00:32:23,00:32:28,"He did, that's right. Yes. When he was 15, he became a monk. Yes. Kind of interesting. Like you?"
00:32:28,00:32:34,"Like me, no. Well, you were kind of semi a monk, weren't you? I went to a Catholic school."
00:32:34,00:32:41,"That's what I'm thinking of. But he was part of the Brothers of Plurmel. Yeah, he left becoming a"
00:32:41,00:32:47,monk when he just got a bit too horny and went on a sort of shagging spree. He said he wanted to
00:32:47,00:32:52,commit every single one of the Ten Commandments. And he didn't want to do that while being a
00:32:52,00:32:59,"monk. He wanted to break them. But wait a minute, I mean, Thou shalt not kill is one of the biggies."
00:32:59,00:33:04,"So that's a pretty tough one. Could be an animal. Well, maybe after he coveted his neighbor's ox,"
00:33:04,00:33:10,maybe he killed it after that. That's possible. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I think he likes a
00:33:10,00:33:17,"good story. I think that's the main point. Yeah. He claims that he once tried to kill, hang on,"
00:33:17,00:33:24,"we're on that command. Oh my God, this does work. Okay, this does work actually. He claimed that once"
00:33:24,00:33:28,he tried to kill his own mother-in-law while he was working at the family Rose-growing business.
00:33:28,00:33:35,What did he do? Did he push her off a cliff so that she landed with a rose up her anus?
00:33:35,00:33:44,"That's it. That's it. Apparently he threw multiple hoes at her. Oh, you mean hoeing implements?"
00:33:44,00:33:49,"Hoeing implements, exactly. Exactly. Because they were to hand, I guess, in the garden,"
00:33:49,00:33:53,in the gardening business where he was working. He was sort of plucked into the world of Dr. Who
00:33:53,00:33:58,"from being a struggling actor. He was working on building sites even as they were filming,"
00:33:58,00:34:05,I think possibly even as it was going out. And he was a very dominating character. It's very
00:34:05,00:34:09,"interesting because he's very eccentric, very lovable. But when you read into him, he did have"
00:34:09,00:34:14,very much a dark side to a lot of how he treated people. And they used to say that it was great
00:34:14,00:34:20,"filming Dr. Who, but it was great only if Tom decided it was a great day. If he decided it wasn't,"
00:34:20,00:34:24,"then that was a bad day. That's like recording this podcast with Anna though, you know."
00:34:24,00:34:29,"That's just the price of the mention. Well, actually, do you know what? There's a character who,"
00:34:29,00:34:36,"the whole of Dr. Who really, I think, is indebted to. And it's someone who I, every time I read"
00:34:36,00:34:42,"about her, I think this is the Anna Tyshinski of Dr. Who. Verity Lambert. Verity Lambert was the"
00:34:42,00:34:47,producer of Dr. Who. And the reason she became the producer of Dr. Who was she was an assistant
00:34:47,00:34:53,on a show that was airing live called Armchair Theatre. And she was working in the background
00:34:53,00:34:58,"and there was a guy called Gareth Jones who was meant to appear on screen and deliver some lines,"
00:34:58,00:35:04,but he had a heart attack and he died before he came on. So all the actors were standing in the
00:35:04,00:35:09,"scene looking off screen at a man who's now on the floor, not knowing what to do. And the main"
00:35:09,00:35:14,"director ran into the studio and he said, Verity, you're now in charge. You're now the producer."
00:35:14,00:35:20,"So she had to suddenly run the whole ship while he was on the set and he was writing the script,"
00:35:20,00:35:25,rewriting it because it really relied on this character who just died in real life to be part
00:35:25,00:35:31,"of it. And while she did that, the heads of BBC saw her talent and went, I think she can be put in"
00:35:31,00:35:36,charge of something that's new and great. Can I ask how this is the same as Anna Tyshinski who's
00:35:36,00:35:44,basically fucked up on holiday and dumps us in it this week? There are a few discrepancies in
00:35:44,00:35:49,"character. No, I can see it. I can see it. I mean, when we make jokes, we frequently die metaphorically"
00:35:49,00:35:54,and Anna has to keep the show going while we do that by making sarcastic comments.
00:35:54,00:35:59,"Yeah, yeah. When they were putting the show together, the guy Sidney Nolan, he said the reason"
00:35:59,00:36:05,"he wanted Verity Lambert is because she was to use the phrase of his full of piss and vinegar,"
00:36:05,00:36:10,"and that's what he wanted. He wanted that as part of his team. And it was a kids show given to her,"
00:36:10,00:36:15,"which was amazing because when they said, are you going to have kids? Because this is a big"
00:36:15,00:36:19,"concern of the BBC back in the day. There used to be a marriage bar, which was lifted in 1944."
00:36:19,00:36:24,"But if you were female working at the BBC, if you got married, you had to leave your job because"
00:36:24,00:36:28,"they thought you would have kids. And so that was the question to her. And she said, I don't know"
00:36:28,00:36:34,"any children. I don't want children. I don't fucking like children. Yeah, it's the direct quote. And"
00:36:34,00:36:39,she was put in charge of what was a kids program. And she's responsible. It's really largely down to
00:36:39,00:36:45,"her for fighting for it, that it that it became a thing. I'm still struggling to see where the"
00:36:45,00:36:50,"other bit comes in here. Absolutely. Maybe the piss and vinegar bit, I guess. I see her as full"
00:36:50,00:36:56,of piss and vinegar. She just won't let something slide. She'll stick up for anything that's not
00:36:56,00:37:01,"right. That's Anna. She'll stick up for anything that's not right. That does sound like Anna,"
00:37:01,00:37:08,"actually. Well, she's my biggest defender. By the way, Tom Baker, not the only great"
00:37:08,00:37:12,"Doctor Who actor out there. I just want to give a quick shout out to John Pertwee,"
00:37:12,00:37:17,who is also one of the doctors. He had an amazing life. He was an advisor for Churchill.
00:37:17,00:37:23,"And yeah, and he used to be in the war rooms with him. And he used to do a thing where at the end"
00:37:23,00:37:28,"of the meetings, when everyone had left, including Churchill, he would scour the floor for all the"
00:37:28,00:37:33,cigarette butts that Churchill had thrown during the meeting onto the carpet. Then he would put
00:37:33,00:37:43,"them in a golf ball. That's how you catch a Churchill. Yeah, he would sell them to his friends"
00:37:43,00:37:51,just for a little tidy sum as a bit of memorabilia of Churchill. It feels like his mind is not 100%
00:37:51,00:37:58,"on the effort of defeating the Nazi. Oh, sorry, that's just John scrounging faggots from the floor."
00:38:00,00:38:04,"We've had a load of facts sent in by a guy called David Lever, who's a huge Doctor Who fan. I just"
00:38:04,00:38:07,"wanted to give him a little shout out. And he said so many amazing facts, I can't do them all,"
00:38:07,00:38:12,"I'm afraid. But one of them I just really like is this. When the deadly assassin, Brackett's,"
00:38:12,00:38:19,"now regarded as one of Tom Baker's best episodes, was released, the head of the Doctor Who Appreciation"
00:38:19,00:38:25,"Society hated it so much, he immediately disbanded the society. This was the last time Doctor Who"
00:38:25,00:38:32,"fans ever got disproportionately angry. Yeah, they do weird things when they're angry. There was"
00:38:32,00:38:36,"one guy, I got this from the John Higgs book, Exterminate Regenerate, which is so good, it's"
00:38:36,00:38:41,"all about Doctor Who. And he said that when it got cancelled, one guy got so angry that he ripped"
00:38:41,00:38:48,off the TV aerial from the outside of his house and he sent it to the BBC as a protest. So good.
00:38:54,00:39:00,"Okay, it is time for the final fact of the show. And very excitingly, all the way from"
00:39:00,00:39:06,"northern Spain, it's Anna. My fact this week, coming to you from the tiny and beautiful and"
00:39:06,00:39:14,"very hot Basque village of Segura, is that the Basque language has at least 50 words for butterfly,"
00:39:14,00:39:21,"one of which means soul of a donkey. So what does that mean, Anna? Oh, we haven't recorded this bit."
00:39:21,00:39:26,"Sorry. Actually, she has sent me another file. So let's listen to that. Other words for butterfly"
00:39:26,00:39:30,"include courtesy of my Basque friend here, Julen."
00:39:30,00:39:42,"Bicillote, Bicillote, Bicillota, Bicillota, Bicillota, Bicillota, Bicillot, Bicillote, Bicillota,"
00:39:42,00:39:55,"Similot, Cimereta, Cimerita, Cimerica, Inguma, Iancoyo, Jinkoyo, Mari Pampalona, Mari Sorgin,"
00:39:56,00:40:06,"Machita, Bimbilin, Bimbilina, Bimbilineta, Bimbiliposha, Bimbiliposha, Sorgin Bici,"
00:40:06,00:40:09,"Sorgin Mandatari, Sorgino Yo. Amazing."
00:40:09,00:40:22,"Very nice. Has anyone done any research on this? A little bit. It's just, I mean,"
00:40:22,00:40:25,there are various different claims. Some people claim there are 80 words for
00:40:25,00:40:30,"butterfly, some people claim there's 100. And also, it's not like these different words"
00:40:30,00:40:34,"mean big butterflies or butterfly, yellow butterflies, all of that. They all literally"
00:40:34,00:40:40,"do just mean butterfly. But I have not seen that Y, in fact. I can't find that either."
00:40:40,00:40:44,"My favorite word for a butterfly in Basque is pin-pillen-poucher,"
00:40:44,00:40:51,because that comes from the sound that the wings make. That's like a really nice Onomatopoeia
00:40:51,00:40:55,quen. Does it? I've heard butterflies flapping. Does that sound it to you guys?
00:40:55,00:41:00,It's flippity-flopping. It's floating about pin-pillen-poucher.
00:41:00,00:41:06,"You need to get a bit closer. So, Basque, we say where the Basque region is for international"
00:41:06,00:41:10,"listeners who are not from the Basque region. It's the top of Spain, slash south of France."
00:41:10,00:41:14,"I think it's seven provinces, historically, where the Basque language is spoken. There's"
00:41:14,00:41:19,"lots of traditional Basque culture. And the language is so weird, isn't it? It's a language"
00:41:19,00:41:26,to isolate. It's not related to anything on either side of it. It's really peculiar.
00:41:26,00:41:30,"Yeah. So, what does that mean? Can we not trace it to anywhere?"
00:41:30,00:41:39,"I think it's believed to be pre-Indo-European. So, lots of the languages that came over from"
00:41:39,00:41:44,"Asia, basically, are related in various different ways. And this is a kind of survivor, almost,"
00:41:44,00:41:49,"the weird outcrop that just has lasted since before that period, which is probably thousands"
00:41:49,00:41:54,and thousands of years ago. Yeah. You get lots of people who have theories that it's related to
00:41:54,00:41:59,"other things. Like, I went on the University of California website and they said that it might"
00:41:59,00:42:07,"be related to Ainu, which is a Japanese isolate language. And what they do, basically, is they"
00:42:07,00:42:11,"look at lists of the words and they go, ""Actually, these words are quite similar."" But I think if"
00:42:11,00:42:16,"you really look at it deep down, it's not really related to any other extant language at all."
00:42:16,00:42:23,Right. It feels too neat that it would be related to another isolate from the completely other side
00:42:23,00:42:29,of the world. Yeah. It's almost too odd. I think the idea being that Basque were often seafaring
00:42:29,00:42:35,people and they might have gone seafaring over to Japan as well and taken the language with them.
00:42:35,00:42:39,"But again, like, I don't think it's true. We have a few words from Basque in English."
00:42:39,00:42:45,Do we? Yeah. Silhouette. The word silhouette. Yeah. So there was a guy called Arnaud de Silhouette.
00:42:45,00:42:51,He was a finance minister of France and he basically was in charge of a big bit of austerity
00:42:51,00:42:56,so no one could afford anything. And so they came up with these like really cheap ways of doing
00:42:56,00:43:01,portraits by cutting out black things. And they named it after him and his surname was Basque.
00:43:01,00:43:05,"Yes. Interesting. Wow. He was from the Basque country. Anchevi, maybe."
00:43:06,00:43:12,"Anchevi, really. Yeah. Arizona, Saspirella, Zorro. A lot of people think bazaar comes from"
00:43:12,00:43:16,"the Basque word for beard, although that's a little bit dubious, that one. But yeah."
00:43:16,00:43:23,"Zorro is a cool word. Yeah. Zorro comes from the Basque word Azaria, meaning fox."
00:43:23,00:43:29,"Oh, nice. I didn't know that. It just is so different. Like, so French for welcome is"
00:43:29,00:43:35,Bienvenue. Spanish is Bienvenidos. You can kind of see where they might be going there. The Basque
00:43:35,00:43:40,is Angiatoria. They're just totally unconnected. I love it. And we should say even within the
00:43:40,00:43:45,"Basque region, there are five different dialects. Like, I think it is quite hard for non-Basque"
00:43:45,00:43:49,"people to learn simply because there aren't many things to cling on to. Like, if you're English"
00:43:49,00:43:53,"and you're trying to learn a fair few European languages, there are lots of links. But there's,"
00:43:53,00:44:00,"in fact, there's a story that the devil wanted to send particular people from the Basque region to"
00:44:00,00:44:05,"hell. So you're trying to learn the language. But after seven years, he had to give up because"
00:44:05,00:44:11,"it was too difficult. But again, the meaning of that one is like these Tongan ones. It's like,"
00:44:11,00:44:15,"okay, Basque is hard. I suppose that's the meaning. And then does that mean after seven years,"
00:44:15,00:44:20,"he decided, well, I'm going to stay out of the Basque country? Yeah, it doesn't have this thing"
00:44:20,00:44:26,"of like, oh, where God's chosen people, like Yorkshire. I think it's just that he, I'm presuming"
00:44:26,00:44:30,"just harder translator or something. I don't know. Because God spent seven years in Leeds,"
00:44:30,00:44:36,"didn't he? And by the end of that, he'd say, hey, help me, doc. That's why Yorkshire gods people."
00:44:36,00:44:43,Traveling to Iceland has become quite nice in the last 10 years for people from the Basque region.
00:44:43,00:44:51,"And that's because in 2015, they officially revoked a law that allowed for citizens of Iceland to kill"
00:44:51,00:44:58,people from Basque on site. On site. On site. No questions asked. No questions asked. It was
00:44:58,00:45:03,"just a completely legal thing. This was due to an incident. No questions, no questions, Basque,"
00:45:03,00:45:11,"more like. So in 1615, there was an incident in which a bunch of... Highlights in Leedsy. Thank you."
00:45:11,00:45:19,"Oh, no, don't get me wrong. It's wonderful stuff. Basically, what happened was is there was a big"
00:45:19,00:45:24,dispute between whalers and the people from Basque were heading out. This is in 1615. And it
00:45:24,00:45:30,resulted in a dispute where they killed a bunch of these Basque whalers. And it's just been in their
00:45:30,00:45:38,"law that you can kill on site since then. And 2015, they actually had governors from the Basque region,"
00:45:38,00:45:44,the Icelandic Minister of Education get together and officially revoke it. So it is now illegal.
00:45:44,00:45:52,"I think in practice in Iceland, it was illegal to kill people more generally. Yeah. I think if"
00:45:52,00:45:56,"you'd have killed someone from the Basque country and said, ""Oh, no, look, it's in the law. I'm allowed"
00:45:56,00:46:02,"to do that,"" they might have said, ""Yeah, but you're not really, are you?"" Maybe. We've had other"
00:46:02,00:46:07,"laws invented since then. But Dan, did you hear the thing about the ceremony, the repeal ceremony"
00:46:07,00:46:12,for this law? Who did you say? It was a couple of local bigwigs. You had the Icelandic Minister
00:46:12,00:46:18,"of Education and then a governor from Basque. Well, they were one of the descendants of a murdered"
00:46:18,00:46:25,"whale hunter and one of the descendants of one of the murderers. Amazing. So they got to be,"
00:46:25,00:46:30,"you know, they were closely involved in this ceremony. Did they let the Basque bigwig kill"
00:46:30,00:46:35,"the Icelandic bigwig as a bit of a blood feud thing? Yeah, it was nice. It was really sweet,"
00:46:35,00:46:41,actually. It was a very touching ceremony. Harpoon through the anus. That's right. God damn.
00:46:41,00:46:48,"Jeez. Do you want to hear some Basque proverbs? Yes, please. All right. ""When the fox is engaging"
00:46:48,00:46:53,"you in conversation, keep an eye on your chicken."" Oh, that's good. Also, ""keep an eye on your water"
00:46:53,00:47:00,"bowl"" was going to be the ending. Same thing. ""Oh, what a pair, a snail and a slug."" Okay, that one's"
00:47:00,00:47:05,"less clear. I think it's when two people are being, they're both difficult. Two ladies"
00:47:05,00:47:09,"who are easy people have found each other and they say, ""Oh, God."" Yeah, nobody's helping you."
00:47:09,00:47:16,"A lot of donkeys need a lot of straw. I'm not even sure that's a proverb, actually. I think"
00:47:16,00:47:22,"it might just be like a logistics thing. Okay. ""In other places, dogs go barefoot, too."""
00:47:22,00:47:27,"Okay. That means that no matter where you go in the world, there'll still be some things"
00:47:27,00:47:33,"that you recognise. Exactly that. It's basically saying things are largely similar in most places,"
00:47:33,00:47:39,"which, again, it's not a slammer of a proverb, I think. For people who very much decide that"
00:47:39,00:47:43,"they're very, very different from all the other people who live around them, has the basket."
00:47:43,00:47:48,"You're absolutely right. They'd probably say to me, ""The words are big, but the acorns are small."""
00:47:48,00:47:55,"You have a small penis? I mean, they would say that to me if they got to know me well, but no,"
00:47:55,00:48:01,that's not what I'm saying. I think it's like ear or mouth and no trousers.
00:48:01,00:48:06,"Oh, that's a good one. All mouth and no trousers. I don't even know what that means."
00:48:06,00:48:10,"It's when you have a lot of talk, but you're not matching it with big action."
00:48:10,00:48:12,All mouth and no trousers? Old fur coats and no knickers.
00:48:12,00:48:16,"That's another great one. Do you know that one, Dan? No. Wow."
00:48:16,00:48:22,"Speaking of knickers, the word ""bask"" refers to a piece of underwear."
00:48:22,00:48:27,"Does it? Yeah. Like a basket, it's almost like a sexy corset."
00:48:27,00:48:30,"You know that? Oh, no, I have heard of that. I have heard of that. Yeah, yeah."
00:48:30,00:48:37,"So you don't spend enough time on summers, you two. Or I spend way too much time on summers,"
00:48:37,00:48:41,"what other two? But apparently, it was first called that in French because it looks a little bit like"
00:48:41,00:48:47,"traditional ""bask"" costume. Right. And also, the French thought that the ""bask"" people,"
00:48:47,00:48:52,"especially the women, were a little bit racy because they wore short skirts and had ear rings."
00:48:52,00:48:57,And the national costume to the French at the time looked a bit oolala.
00:48:57,00:49:04,"To put it in French. They had a big problem with witches in the 17th century, the ""bask"" region."
00:49:04,00:49:09,"Oh, yeah. Huge problem, actually. They had a lot of witch hunting."
00:49:09,00:49:12,"And there's a very famous bit of history, which is called the ""bask witch hunt"" effectively."
00:49:12,00:49:16,"And it was like hundreds and thousands of people in the ""bask"" region confessed that they'd been"
00:49:16,00:49:21,to the witches' Sabbath. And I'm afraid to say they had had sex with the devil.
00:49:21,00:49:22,You learn the language by then.
00:49:22,00:49:29,I think it was the language of love by that point. You'd fly in basically either on a broom
00:49:29,00:49:35,"or a goat, apparently, if you couldn't afford a broom. And you'd worship the devil a bit and then"
00:49:35,00:49:38,"you'd, I think you would dig up dead witches and eat them. That was the thing that supposedly"
00:49:38,00:49:43,"happened at these kind of witchy fiestas. If you were old and you had no teeth, the devil would"
00:49:43,00:49:52,"lend you his own dentures. The stories of what? It's disgusting. It's disgusting. Also, the thought"
00:49:52,00:49:57,of the devil with his teeth out is quite a funny one. You're a mortal soul.
00:49:57,00:50:06,This is such weird reports like children would be given velvet-clad toads to guard at these fiestas.
00:50:06,00:50:11,"Witches would dance with toads as large as chickens. I mean, it's mad. It's a completely mad"
00:50:11,00:50:15,episode of history. It was probably just people being tortured until they confessed. I'm afraid
00:50:15,00:50:21,"it was mostly, wasn't it? Yeah. The Basque version of Santa is kind of interesting. It's called"
00:50:21,00:50:28,"Olent Zero. And if children don't want to go to bed, a sickle is thrown down the chimney,"
00:50:28,00:50:32,and the children are told that Olent Zero will come and cut their throats if they don't go to
00:50:32,00:50:37,"sleep. Yikes. And what happens is they mostly go to sleep, I imagine."
00:50:40,00:50:45,"One last thing, maybe. Butterfly. Where the English word butterfly comes from."
00:50:45,00:50:49,"Okay. Because butterfly is quite a nice word in lots of different languages, really."
00:50:49,00:50:56,"I'm thinking papillon. And falafala in Italian. I think in German, it's something not quite so"
00:50:56,00:51:02,beautiful. It's like German. It'll be an 18 consonant. It'll be a really mechanical. Yeah.
00:51:02,00:51:07,"But in English, butterfly, we don't really know where butterfly comes from. So there's an idea"
00:51:07,00:51:12,"that they would, if you left your milk uncovered, they would come and drink the milk and steal your"
00:51:12,00:51:19,"butter and stuff. But I think the best version is it comes from the Dutch old word for a butterfly,"
00:51:19,00:51:28,which was buttersheiter. Which was because butterflies had yellow excrement. And so the Dutch
00:51:28,00:51:35,"called them like butter, buttershit. And then we stole that name. And then over the years,"
00:51:35,00:51:40,"like a lot of these things, their word shater just turns into fly because you're being polite with"
00:51:40,00:51:46,your kids. Yeah. That was really funny. I've just googled German for butterflies schmetterling.
00:51:46,00:51:51,"Schmetterling, that's right. That could have been a warplane, you know?"
00:51:51,00:51:57,I've got a bunch of schmetterlings on my ass. Deploy the chaff. Deploy the glitter.
00:51:57,00:52:00,What was the glitter called? They were called schnibbles.
00:52:00,00:52:05,Schnibbles. Deploy the schnibbles. Deploy the end-to-schmatterling schnibbles.
00:52:05,00:52:09,They come out of the back of the plane with a big banag.
00:52:09,00:52:20,"Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening. If you would like to"
