00:00:00,00:00:04,"Hey everybody, before we get going, we have two bits of news to give you."
00:00:04,00:00:09,"One very big, Stephen Frye is stepping down from QI and is going to be replaced by the"
00:00:09,00:00:15,"incredible Sandy Toxwig, and so the final ever Stephen Frye hosted QI series starts"
00:00:15,00:00:19,"tonight, October 16th at 10pm on BBC2."
00:00:19,00:00:20,So tune in.
00:00:20,00:00:22,"Okay, news number two."
00:00:22,00:00:26,So if you don't want to watch a really smart person tell you interesting things on a Friday
00:00:26,00:00:29,"night, then you could watch a bunch of idiots tell you equally"
00:00:29,00:00:32,interesting things on Sunday night in Brighton.
00:00:32,00:00:36,"We are doing our podcast, no such thing as a fish show at the Brighton Comedy Festival."
00:00:36,00:00:43,"It's a 5pm on Sunday evening, and also in Brighton this weekend, QI's chief gnome founder,"
00:00:43,00:00:48,"creator, top dog, John Lloyd is going to be performing his show, Fresh from the Edinburgh"
00:00:48,00:00:51,"Fringe, and here's a little taster of him."
00:00:51,00:00:53,He happens to be right here with us now.
00:00:53,00:00:54,Hi John.
00:00:54,00:00:55,Hello.
00:00:55,00:00:59,"Yep, so if you enjoyed that, there's 59 more minutes of that kind of gold coming to you."
00:00:59,00:01:02,Go see his show as Emperor of the Prawns.
00:01:02,00:01:07,And now on with this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish.
00:01:07,00:01:25,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this"
00:01:25,00:01:28,week coming to you from the Lowry and Solford.
00:01:28,00:01:32,"My name is Dan Schreiber, joining me on the stage as the three regular elves, it's Andy"
00:01:32,00:01:41,"Murray, Anichezinski and James Harkin."
00:01:41,00:01:45,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from"
00:01:45,00:01:50,"the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go, starting with My Fact."
00:01:50,00:01:56,"My Fact this week is the seventh time Park Ranger Roy Sullivan was struck by lightning,"
00:01:56,00:02:04,coincided with the 22nd time he fought off a bear with a stick.
00:02:04,00:02:08,So this guy is a park ranger.
00:02:08,00:02:12,"He was, I think he was fishing at the time, so he was just out there."
00:02:12,00:02:16,"He's been struck six times before, and then the lightning was coming."
00:02:16,00:02:20,"He just thought I'll just stay here, probably nothing bad will happen."
00:02:20,00:02:24,"God struck by lightning, was running back to his car, and suddenly a bear comes out"
00:02:24,00:02:25,of nowhere.
00:02:25,00:02:29,"Jesus Christ, has to fight off a bear and then went back home."
00:02:29,00:02:37,"His diary must have been amazing, bear, bear, lightning, lightning and bear."
00:02:37,00:02:40,"But he, as I said, he's been struck seven times."
00:02:40,00:02:44,"He was almost struck eight times, but the eighth time when he should have been struck, it"
00:02:44,00:02:48,hit his wife instead.
00:02:48,00:02:49,It sounds awful.
00:02:49,00:02:52,"It sounds terrible because obviously he was interviewed because he was very, he became"
00:02:52,00:02:58,"well known for this, and he said, naturally, people avoid me."
00:02:58,00:03:02,"I was walking with the chief ranger one day, and lightning struck way off, and he said,"
00:03:02,00:03:06,"""I'll see you later, Roy."""
00:03:06,00:03:11,"Then he said, ""There's a restaurant on Loft Mountain that even it's just overcast, they"
00:03:11,00:03:14,"won't let me in."""
00:03:14,00:03:16,It sounds awful.
00:03:16,00:03:21,"It sounds terrible because at time number four, this is August 1973, I think he died"
00:03:21,00:03:27,"in the early 80s, possibly, but in August 1973, he got in his car and he accelerated because"
00:03:27,00:03:32,"there was a cloud forming, and he was very nervous about storm clouds by this point."
00:03:32,00:03:39,"And he out ran it, stopped the car, got out of it to watch the storm hit by lightning again."
00:03:39,00:03:42,They have a full list of all the times that he was...
00:03:42,00:03:44,The first time he lost his big toenail.
00:03:44,00:03:45,Right.
00:03:45,00:03:46,To lightning.
00:03:46,00:03:47,"Oh, it's a big toenail."
00:03:47,00:03:48,"Yeah, a big toenail."
00:03:48,00:03:54,"At the time, a bolt came out of a small low-lying cloud, hit him on the head through his hat,"
00:03:54,00:03:58,"set his hair on fire again, again."
00:03:58,00:04:02,"Not in ten feet out of his car, and not his left shoe off."
00:04:02,00:04:07,Do you know why shoes come off when you get hit by lightning?
00:04:07,00:04:11,This is because you watch cartoons.
00:04:11,00:04:16,"So for example, when it hits a tree, lightning, it will sometimes explode a tree if the moisture"
00:04:16,00:04:20,"is in the middle of the tree, because it takes the path of least resistance."
00:04:20,00:04:25,"People obviously, there's moisture everywhere and we're 70% liquid, so it often dissipates"
00:04:25,00:04:27,all over your skin.
00:04:27,00:04:32,"But when it does that, all the sweat and the moisture on you boil into steam immediately"
00:04:32,00:04:37,and sometimes so much steam is produced that your shoes will be blown off.
00:04:37,00:04:38,That's what causes it.
00:04:38,00:04:40,So he got struck seven times.
00:04:40,00:04:41,Yeah.
00:04:41,00:04:42,I found somebody who's been struck even more.
00:04:42,00:04:43,Really?
00:04:43,00:04:47,"There's a guy called Melvin Roberts from South Carolina, and he at least claims to have"
00:04:47,00:04:49,been struck ten times.
00:04:49,00:04:54,"He was in the news in 2011 for being hit six times, and his wife says that he's been struck"
00:04:54,00:04:56,another four times since.
00:04:56,00:04:57,"By lightning, definitely."
00:04:57,00:05:00,She's not just by thinking really about it.
00:05:00,00:05:05,I think I found a group of people who've been struck by lightning even more than that.
00:05:05,00:05:06,"Well, really?"
00:05:06,00:05:07,Yeah.
00:05:07,00:05:08,So I was reading the 14 times.
00:05:08,00:05:12,"It's an amazing magazine, and in it, they had a small story where someone had written"
00:05:12,00:05:18,"in to contest the fact that Roy Sullivan was the most struck person of all time, and what"
00:05:18,00:05:23,"they said was that in 1995, a group of explorers who were up on a mountain mountaineer's got"
00:05:23,00:05:29,"struck twenty times in sixteen hours, a group of five, and they were in their tent, and they"
00:05:29,00:05:34,"all describe the moment that they were struck, and they were just in there getting struck"
00:05:34,00:05:39,"over and over again, seventeen times, and we got to get out of there, out of here."
00:05:39,00:05:43,"There's a rescue shelter down the mountain, so he started absailing, and while they were"
00:05:43,00:05:47,"doing that, they were struck three more times on the absailed down."
00:05:47,00:05:48,"Oh, my God."
00:05:48,00:05:51,"To be fair, I do think you have to define that by five, though, at which point you haven't"
00:05:51,00:05:52,been record anymore.
00:05:52,00:05:53,Very good point.
00:05:53,00:05:54,Yeah.
00:05:54,00:05:55,It's all about the mass.
00:05:55,00:05:56,"Sometimes goes from one person to another, as well."
00:05:56,00:05:57,No.
00:05:57,00:06:02,"Or it can hit, for example, it can rebound off a tree and into a horse or whatever."
00:06:02,00:06:03,Yeah.
00:06:03,00:06:06,"I mean, then it's less likely to kill you, because at least some of the force has been"
00:06:06,00:06:07,dissipated.
00:06:07,00:06:08,Yeah.
00:06:08,00:06:13,"Men account for 85% of lightning strikes, isn't that weird?"
00:06:13,00:06:17,And the National Weather Service in the US speculated that this might be because men tend
00:06:17,00:06:22,"to be unaware of all the dangers associated with lightning, more likely to be invulnerable"
00:06:22,00:06:28,"situations, unwilling to be inconvenienced by the threat of lightning, and don't react"
00:06:28,00:06:33,"quickly to the lightning threat, or any combination of these explanations."
00:06:33,00:06:37,"So there's stupid, ignorant, big-headed, and they have very slow reactions."
00:06:37,00:06:41,"No, she was just my interpretation, but I think that's the long and short of it."
00:06:41,00:06:47,A man in Croatia has admitted that he has not gone outside after hearing thunder since
00:06:47,00:06:52,lightning struck his penis in 2007.
00:06:52,00:07:00,"Zoran Jurkovich, it's online, honestly."
00:07:00,00:07:06,"Zoran Jurkovich said, ""My friends used to tease me, and I used to tease them back, saying"
00:07:06,00:07:13,"my penis has extraordinary ability now, but it doesn't."""
00:07:13,00:07:23,It's hard to tease them back when you've just got a sort of child stumped.
00:07:23,00:07:26,"So I think there might be something about Croatia, God hates it or something, so there's"
00:07:26,00:07:32,a Croatian woman who has been left recently with a severely burned anus after a lightning
00:07:32,00:07:37,"strike, ended her mouth while she was cleaning her teeth and drinking water from the tap,"
00:07:37,00:07:42,"came through the tap, ended her mouth, and then left through the anus so it could earth"
00:07:42,00:07:44,through the ground.
00:07:44,00:07:50,"Apparently, so the report said she was wearing rubber-sold shoes, so once the lightning had entered"
00:07:50,00:07:53,"through her mouth when she was drinking water from the tap, it took the easiest route and"
00:07:53,00:07:56,came out of her rectum to reach her rubber-sold shoes.
00:07:56,00:08:04,"You know, speaking of lightning coming out the bum, there actually is a fabled worm called"
00:08:04,00:08:11,"the Mongolian death worm, which is in Mongolia, and is it done?"
00:08:11,00:08:12,Is it?
00:08:12,00:08:17,"It's a massive worm, and all accounts of it say that it can shoot acid from its eyes and"
00:08:17,00:08:19,lightning bolts from its anus.
00:08:19,00:08:20,Accounts?
00:08:20,00:08:25,"I don't think they deserve the name ""accounts."""
00:08:25,00:08:28,One really knows why lightning happens today.
00:08:28,00:08:33,"We find, when you're at school, they tell you it's because clouds are rubbing together"
00:08:33,00:08:37,"or whatever, and it kind of is that a little bit, but it's like ice going up in their clouds"
00:08:37,00:08:40,"and water coming down or the other way around, and they rub against each other, and it causes"
00:08:40,00:08:43,like static electricity like you would have with a balloon.
00:08:43,00:08:47,"But no one really knows why it starts, and it's like a chain reaction that starts, and"
00:08:47,00:08:51,"one theory you'll like this done, apparently there's a latest theory coming from Russia"
00:08:51,00:08:56,"that it's cosmic rays, which come from outside the solar system and hit the earth, and that's"
00:08:56,00:08:59,what starts the lightning in the first place.
00:08:59,00:09:00,Wow.
00:09:00,00:09:01,"And no one knows what causes cosmic rays, really."
00:09:01,00:09:04,"I mean, it could be supernovas or quasars or..."
00:09:04,00:09:07,The Mongolian death worm.
00:09:07,00:09:10,We can't rule it out.
00:09:10,00:09:13,"Yeah, amazing."
00:09:13,00:09:17,"You know, America has two annual conferences for lightning strikes survivors."
00:09:17,00:09:18,"Oh, really?"
00:09:18,00:09:19,Yeah.
00:09:19,00:09:22,It's actually about 80% of people struck by lightning actually survive...
00:09:22,00:09:23,"Yes, right."
00:09:23,00:09:24,"Yes, it is."
00:09:24,00:09:27,"80% to 90% live, but it's not plain sailing after that."
00:09:27,00:09:30,"It's not as though you have burns and then you recover, it can scramble your memory, and"
00:09:30,00:09:34,"there are all these long-term effects that we don't know about, and it just gets right"
00:09:34,00:09:39,"into your cells, and there aren't enough cases that are studied in the medical literature"
00:09:39,00:09:43,"to have a proper body of science, so it's a lot of guesswork, and yeah, there just isn't"
00:09:43,00:09:46,the money to try and work out what exactly has happened.
00:09:46,00:09:47,Okay.
00:09:47,00:09:49,We're going to have to move on to our next fact in a minute.
00:09:49,00:09:51,Is there anything else you guys want to add?
00:09:51,00:09:57,"Um, another thing that we can't explain is the lightning that happens at the beacon of"
00:09:57,00:10:01,"Mara Cabo, which is the most incredible place on the planet."
00:10:01,00:10:03,So this is a place in Venezuela.
00:10:03,00:10:10,"It's the Catatumbo River, I think in Venezuela, and it's one tiny spot where for 280 times"
00:10:10,00:10:16,"an hour, for 10 hours a night, for 160 nights a year, lightning strikes this exact same"
00:10:16,00:10:17,"spot, and nobody knows why."
00:10:17,00:10:24,"I reckon it could be Roy Sullivan doing some fishing, but isn't that weird, and it was mentioned"
00:10:24,00:10:30,"first in a poem about Francis Drake in 1597, and Fisherman used it on this lake in Venezuela"
00:10:30,00:10:35,"to light their way, so if they're going fishing, they just use this class and lightning storm"
00:10:35,00:10:37,"to say, okay, well, there's the storm, yes, we go towards that, because that's where we'll"
00:10:37,00:10:38,get the best light.
00:10:38,00:10:39,Slash die.
00:10:39,00:10:43,"Um, yeah, no one knows what happens."
00:10:43,00:10:44,Wow.
00:10:44,00:10:45,That's amazing.
00:10:45,00:10:49,"You read about that, and I think it replenishes the ozone layer, doesn't it?"
00:10:49,00:10:52,"The biggest source of ozone on Earth, the biggest single source of ozone on Earth, so it's"
00:10:52,00:10:53,a good thing.
00:10:53,00:10:54,"Yeah, it's a good thing."
00:10:54,00:10:55,That's so cool.
00:10:55,00:10:59,"Okay, we're going to move on to fact number two, and that is James Harkin."
00:10:59,00:11:06,"Okay, my fact this week is that this year, America's Hero Dog of the Year award was won"
00:11:06,00:11:07,by a cat.
00:11:07,00:11:08,(Laughter)
00:11:08,00:11:12,It can't have been a good night to be a dog.
00:11:12,00:11:19,"Yeah, so this is Tara the Cat, and I reckon some people will know it, or will at least know"
00:11:19,00:11:22,the cat itself because it's been a bit of an internet sensation.
00:11:22,00:11:25,There was a young child being mulled by a dog next to a car.
00:11:25,00:11:30,"You might have seen the video on YouTube, and then this cat runs on and kind of scares the"
00:11:30,00:11:35,"dog away, and then runs off again, and she became such a hero that she is now an honorary"
00:11:35,00:11:36,dog.
00:11:36,00:11:37,Wow.
00:11:37,00:11:44,"What a way to reward her to invite her to a ceremony full of dogs, who now it was soft"
00:11:44,00:11:46,at a cat's one.
00:11:46,00:11:47,It is amazing.
00:11:47,00:11:49,She just full on runs into the dog.
00:11:49,00:11:50,She just smashes her head.
00:11:50,00:11:51,Have you guys seen that video?
00:11:51,00:11:52,You must have done it right.
00:11:52,00:11:53,"Yeah, it's good."
00:11:53,00:11:54,It's good to watch.
00:11:54,00:11:58,"Yeah, she got a few other awards, actually."
00:11:58,00:12:02,"She was invited by the local baseball team, the Bakersfield Blaze, because this was in"
00:12:02,00:12:05,Bakersfield in California.
00:12:05,00:12:10,"They invited her to throw the first pitch, not a way."
00:12:10,00:12:11,"Yeah, and a baseball game."
00:12:11,00:12:12,How did she do?
00:12:12,00:12:16,"Well, it said on the news report that she was assisted by her family."
00:12:16,00:12:22,"I watched it, and the family do a lot of assisting."
00:12:22,00:12:27,"It goes wrong about five times, and then basically a guy holding a cat throws a ball."
00:12:27,00:12:28,That's basically it.
00:12:28,00:12:33,But this video is the first YouTube video in history to reach 20 million views in five
00:12:33,00:12:34,days.
00:12:34,00:12:37,"And the cat became a hero, and the dog was put down."
00:12:37,00:12:38,Wasn't it?
00:12:38,00:12:39,No way.
00:12:39,00:12:40,Did you just bite it?
00:12:40,00:12:42,It had been the child really badly on the leg.
00:12:42,00:12:43,"Yeah, OK, yeah."
00:12:43,00:12:46,Sorry.
00:12:46,00:12:47,On the dog side.
00:12:47,00:12:49,"No, I'm not."
00:12:49,00:12:52,"Cats have a long and noble history of impersonating dogs, though, don't they?"
00:12:52,00:12:55,"Because they bark, like, can bark like dogs."
00:12:55,00:12:58,"Like, if you have cats and dogs they've been together, then cats will learn to impersonate"
00:12:58,00:12:59,dogs.
00:12:59,00:13:00,"OK, hang on."
00:13:00,00:13:01,"No, I've never--"
00:13:01,00:13:02,Yeah.
00:13:02,00:13:05,I'm the Mongolian death one guy.
00:13:05,00:13:08,"If you basically look at a time into YouTube, cats bark like dogs."
00:13:08,00:13:13,"Are you sure that a cat can bark like a dog, and not that a dog can throw its voice?"
00:13:13,00:13:17,"Dogs are actually amazing ventriloquists, and we've not realized."
00:13:17,00:13:21,But there is a really good video on YouTube of a cat owner.
00:13:21,00:13:24,"I mean, I can't believe we're discussing YouTube memes, but let's do it."
00:13:24,00:13:29,"A cat owner who sneaks up behind her cat, filming her cat, sitting on a window ledge,"
00:13:29,00:13:31,"looking outside at a dog, which obviously lives with the family."
00:13:31,00:13:34,"They all live for next door, so it's lived around it, and barking."
00:13:34,00:13:37,"And it's honestly going, the cat's going, ""Ruff, ruff, ruff."""
00:13:37,00:13:38,"And it keeps doing this, loads."
00:13:38,00:13:42,"And then the person who's holding the camera sort of clears her throat, and the cat hears,"
00:13:42,00:13:44,"and looks around and starts to be, ""Mew!"""
00:13:44,00:13:47,[LAUGHTER]
00:13:47,00:13:52,"And the science came up with some bullshit expression, like, ""Oh, she turned her vocal chords,"
00:13:52,00:13:54,"she turned around, which changed the tenor of her voice."""
00:13:54,00:14:00,"But it's quite clearly the cat going, ""Woop see, I've been caught right in the act of impersonating"
00:14:00,00:14:01,"a dog."""
00:14:01,00:14:02,[LAUGHTER]
00:14:02,00:14:06,"So, just on heroic dogs, I have a couple of different kinds of heroic dogs that we all know"
00:14:06,00:14:07,about.
00:14:07,00:14:09,"So, bomb detecting dogs, I mean, how about guide dogs."
00:14:09,00:14:13,"There is only one, I believe, there's great piece in the Guardian about this."
00:14:13,00:14:17,There is only one airborne nut allergy dog in the UK.
00:14:17,00:14:18,[LAUGHTER]
00:14:18,00:14:20,"Sorry, the dog was airborne on the nut."
00:14:20,00:14:23,[LAUGHTER]
00:14:23,00:14:25,"My fault, should have clarified."
00:14:25,00:14:26,"So, there's a woman also called Tara, actually."
00:14:26,00:14:30,"Tara Bedford, she has an incredibly bad nut allergy, so bad that even the smell of"
00:14:30,00:14:32,nuts can trigger a reaction.
00:14:32,00:14:36,"She says, ""Any rustle on a train or a bus, and it's, what are they opening?"
00:14:36,00:14:37,"Should I move?"""
00:14:37,00:14:41,"She can't go to the cinema, she can't go to a catch, she can't go in a plane because someone"
00:14:41,00:14:44,"opens a pack of the peanuts and she's dead, she's in a plane."
00:14:44,00:14:50,"She had to go to any 40 times in four years, but the story has a happy ending because there"
00:14:50,00:14:58,"was a labrador who had failed a guide dog test for overuse of the nose, put them together,"
00:14:58,00:15:03,"and now the dog forcefully pushes her whenever the dog smells nuts, a peanut or a nut she's"
00:15:03,00:15:04,allergic to.
00:15:04,00:15:06,So it's a very good ending.
00:15:06,00:15:07,Seeing nose dog.
00:15:07,00:15:08,"Seeing nose dog, yeah."
00:15:08,00:15:09,"Wow, that's so cool."
00:15:09,00:15:10,Wow.
00:15:10,00:15:11,And he flies as well.
00:15:11,00:15:12,And he's...
00:15:12,00:15:13,[LAUGHTER]
00:15:13,00:15:15,Russian.
00:15:15,00:15:17,Sorry.
00:15:17,00:15:19,Russia employs sniffer cats.
00:15:19,00:15:20,Really?
00:15:20,00:15:21,Really?
00:15:21,00:15:27,"Yeah, there's some sniffer cats in Russia, and they're looking for kind of Russian Mafia"
00:15:27,00:15:34,that might be smuggling fish for the caviar down in the south of Russia.
00:15:34,00:15:37,"And the most famous one, the first one was called the Rusek."
00:15:37,00:15:40,And Rusek died when he was hit by a criminal's car quite recently.
00:15:40,00:15:44,"And the locals thought that it might be a contract killing because the week before, another"
00:15:44,00:15:48,cat called Barsik was killed after he was poisoned by a mouse.
00:15:48,00:15:49,What?
00:15:49,00:15:51,"Sorry, with a mouse."
00:15:51,00:15:52,[LAUGHTER]
00:15:52,00:15:58,Yeah.
00:15:58,00:16:03,I was looking into sort of the latest in cat news.
00:16:03,00:16:06,And I headed to a place I discovered a few podcasts ago.
00:16:06,00:16:11,I headed to Pussington Post.
00:16:11,00:16:14,Just a few recent headlines.
00:16:14,00:16:17,Cat ignores frogs sitting on his paw.
00:16:17,00:16:18,That's...
00:16:18,00:16:21,"That was September 17th, if you want to look that one up."
00:16:21,00:16:27,"If you're into cat news, which you obviously are, there's this guy who is constantly updating"
00:16:27,00:16:28,us on cat news.
00:16:28,00:16:34,"He runs a Twitter feed called NBA Catwatch, and the entire Twitter feed is devoted to finding"
00:16:34,00:16:38,out what cats are owned by basketball players.
00:16:38,00:16:40,And he's been going for quite a while now.
00:16:40,00:16:44,"So he said, it's sort of a typical dumb Twitter joke, but the more he thought about it, something"
00:16:44,00:16:45,caught in my brain.
00:16:45,00:16:50,"I'd be watching a basketball game, and I'd start to think about who does owner cat"
00:16:50,00:16:51,on this team.
00:16:51,00:16:57,"He said, I'm aware that it's ridiculous trying to find NBA players cats on social media."
00:16:57,00:17:00,"However, it's my niche, and I got there first."
00:17:00,00:17:01,[LAUGHTER]
00:17:01,00:17:07,"And yet, no one has ever got the second out there."
00:17:07,00:17:16,"I found a really exciting Guinness Book World Record, which is for world-mousing champion."
00:17:16,00:17:18,"And the winner of this, the current champion of this award."
00:17:18,00:17:19,It's a dog.
00:17:19,00:17:20,It's a dog.
00:17:20,00:17:24,"It's a cat, but it's amazing that this is an actual record that's being held."
00:17:24,00:17:32,"So it's a cat called Towsr, and Towsr was stationed at Distillery in Scotland, where Grouse"
00:17:32,00:17:34,Whiskey is made.
00:17:34,00:17:39,"And during her reign, she killed 28,899 mice."
00:17:39,00:17:40,No way.
00:17:40,00:17:42,And so that's a Guinness World Record.
00:17:42,00:17:43,No way.
00:17:43,00:17:44,And then she died.
00:17:44,00:17:47,"So she got taken over by another cat called Amber, who's been there for 20 years now, and"
00:17:47,00:17:51,who they've said was not known to have caught a single mouse.
00:17:51,00:17:54,They've all been caught already.
00:17:54,00:17:56,She's just got there at a first angle.
00:17:56,00:17:59,"Well, there's not much to do here, isn't it?"
00:17:59,00:18:02,Can I tell you about a couple of more little dog things?
00:18:02,00:18:02,"Yes, please."
00:18:02,00:18:08,"So there's another kind of dog, which is a Corpse Detection Dog."
00:18:08,00:18:11,"So please use them to find bodies, things like this."
00:18:11,00:18:15,"And they have to be trained, but you can't train them obviously on real cases, because"
00:18:15,00:18:17,they're very few of those.
00:18:17,00:18:23,So they're trained by wrapping up pigs bodies in shower curtains.
00:18:23,00:18:26,"And there's a man who runs a search company, his name is Mick Swindles, and he says he"
00:18:26,00:18:30,"always puts clothes on the pigs, too, for added realism."
00:18:30,00:18:32,Insert your own David Cameron joke here.
00:18:32,00:18:33,"Oh, God."
00:18:33,00:18:41,"Well, this is the thing."
00:18:41,00:18:45,"He said of them, because he puts clothes on them, and he said, people say, why do you always"
00:18:45,00:18:47,put them in a skirt?
00:18:47,00:18:49,Have you ever tried putting trousers on a pig?
00:18:49,00:18:57,"So presumably these cat's are just now really good at detecting clothes, pigs, dogs are"
00:18:57,00:19:02,"really good at detecting clothes, pigs, and not that good at detecting human causes."
00:19:02,00:19:04,We're very similar to pigs in many ways.
00:19:04,00:19:05,Speak yourself.
00:19:05,00:19:06,OK.
00:19:06,00:19:08,We're going to have to move on in a sec.
00:19:08,00:19:09,Can I say one thing?
00:19:09,00:19:14,"This original fact was in Bakersfield in California, and so I found another story from"
00:19:14,00:19:15,Bakersfield.
00:19:15,00:19:16,It's just a quick one.
00:19:16,00:19:22,"It's a guy called Mr. Slivers, and he was arrested, and they interviewed him afterwards."
00:19:22,00:19:27,"And this way he said, he said, I was just bored, and I decided I wanted to be a cat burglar."
00:19:27,00:19:32,"So I kicked in the window and tried to steal the lion, but it was too heavy, so I stole the"
00:19:32,00:19:34,cat.
00:19:34,00:19:37,"And he wanted to be a cat burglar, and thought that a cat burglar is something that steals"
00:19:37,00:19:38,cats.
00:19:38,00:19:43,I'm more interested in the home that owns both the lion and the cat.
00:19:43,00:19:44,So it was a museum.
00:19:44,00:19:45,It was a museum.
00:19:45,00:19:46,Oh.
00:19:46,00:19:47,Sorry.
00:19:47,00:19:48,Right.
00:19:48,00:19:49,OK.
00:19:49,00:19:50,Got it.
00:19:50,00:19:55,"Otherwise, I don't think you'd be saying the lion is too heavy."
00:19:55,00:19:57,Weight is the least of your problems.
00:19:57,00:20:03,That lion was way too bitey on my face.
00:20:03,00:20:04,OK.
00:20:04,00:20:08,"It's time for fact number three, and that is Chazinsky."
00:20:08,00:20:09,Yeah.
00:20:09,00:20:16,Fact is that the earliest known penalty for illegal parking was to be impaled on a stake.
00:20:16,00:20:17,Yeah.
00:20:17,00:20:22,"It's firm, it's firm, but it's fair."
00:20:22,00:20:29,"And if you appeal, it's a smaller stake."
00:20:29,00:20:33,So this was actually in 700 BC.
00:20:33,00:20:37,"This is the earliest parking restriction I can find, so it's in Nineveh, which is the"
00:20:37,00:20:38,Assyrian capital.
00:20:38,00:20:42,And the parking restriction was put in place by King Sinacarib.
00:20:42,00:20:47,"And we have a stone tablet where he's laid out the restriction, and it says, Royal Road"
00:20:47,00:20:54,"let no man decrease it, or let no man lessen it, this Royal Road, and on pain of being impaled"
00:20:54,00:20:55,on a stake.
00:20:55,00:20:58,"And you got impaled on a stake if you did park on the Royal Road in your chariot, obviously"
00:20:58,00:21:00,not your motor car.
00:21:00,00:21:04,And impaled on a stake and then planted in your own garden so that people who were coming
00:21:04,00:21:09,"to visit you could go, oh, I guess he's not available for tea."
00:21:09,00:21:11,"Wow, planted in your own garden."
00:21:11,00:21:14,Would you have a little label sticking out like you get on those plants?
00:21:14,00:21:15,Yeah.
00:21:15,00:21:16,"Yeah, with the species."
00:21:16,00:21:19,This is a Norman.
00:21:19,00:21:24,"Yeah, Sinacarib, he was, he's most famous for moving his capital city to Nineveh, like"
00:21:24,00:21:28,"you say, and had like a really amazing capital city then he had like gardens."
00:21:28,00:21:32,"They think it might be in the Hanging Gardens, if anyone was there."
00:21:32,00:21:34,"And yeah, he was just an extremely opulent man."
00:21:34,00:21:40,"Apparently he had a piece of Noah's Ark which he worshipped as a god, and he once wrote"
00:21:40,00:21:45,"about his enemies, their testicles I cut off, and tore out their privates like the seeds"
00:21:45,00:21:48,of cucumbers.
00:21:48,00:21:50,"He was good with a simile, actually."
00:21:50,00:21:56,Sounds like he was very bad at making sandwiches.
00:21:56,00:22:07,"You selectively shave the outside of a cucumber, then you slot it at home in the sandwich."
00:22:07,00:22:12,"He actually, so he was not a humble man because he did create these incredible gardens."
00:22:12,00:22:16,"I mean, he's, I think people should know more about Sinacarib and very little is written"
00:22:16,00:22:17,about him.
00:22:17,00:22:21,"But a lot of historians now think that the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, as you say, were"
00:22:21,00:22:25,"his gardens, and he irrigated the mountains all around, so he built this incredible canal"
00:22:25,00:22:31,"that stretched 50 kilometers up into the mountains, and which irrigated his whole amazing new city."
00:22:31,00:22:35,"But he was pretty cocky about it, so even on the signposts where he said you'll be impaled"
00:22:35,00:22:39,on a steak or cucumber or whatever if you part here.
00:22:39,00:22:43,Then the little signposts then went on to list his achievements.
00:22:43,00:22:48,"Explaining Sinacarib is a king of the world, favorite of the gods, holder of invincible weapons"
00:22:48,00:22:50,and architect of urban design.
00:22:50,00:22:53,So I think that's quite a piece of it.
00:22:53,00:22:57,"On those signs you put up here, here's what I've achieved, guys."
00:22:57,00:22:58,Wow.
00:22:58,00:22:59,Yeah.
00:22:59,00:23:00,That's amazing.
00:23:00,00:23:03,"Do you know, in Britain, the first ever parking ticket that was given?"
00:23:03,00:23:04,No.
00:23:04,00:23:06,"Okay, so it was in September 1960."
00:23:06,00:23:08,They set this up.
00:23:08,00:23:09,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:23:09,00:23:12,It was quite like where it was like an established proper where parking attendance went
00:23:12,00:23:14,out.
00:23:14,00:23:19,And the first ever ticket was given to a Dr. Thomas Craton who was answering an emergency
00:23:19,00:23:23,call to help a heart attack victim at a West End Hotel.
00:23:23,00:23:24,So he raced there.
00:23:24,00:23:25,He got out.
00:23:25,00:23:26,"When he came back, he had a ticket."
00:23:26,00:23:31,"And there was so much public outcry that they said, okay, you haven't got a ticket."
00:23:31,00:23:32,That was the first ticket.
00:23:32,00:23:39,"Could you imagine the, how was your first day, the clocked up pretty bad."
00:23:39,00:23:43,But the first parking ticket in America was also had to be overturned.
00:23:43,00:23:44,"Oh, really?"
00:23:44,00:23:46,Maybe parking tickets are just a failed enterprise.
00:23:46,00:23:48,"Yeah, this was a reverend, actually."
00:23:48,00:23:53,The reverend CH North of the third Penta Costal Honest Church.
00:23:53,00:23:56,"And it was a newly installed parking meter, the country's first parking meter."
00:23:56,00:24:01,"And he just ran into a shop to get change and by the time he'd come out, he got a ticket."
00:24:01,00:24:03,And he complained to the courts and had it overturned.
00:24:03,00:24:04,Wow.
00:24:04,00:24:08,It would be pretty hard to get it overturned in the old days when you're being impaled
00:24:08,00:24:10,on a stage.
00:24:10,00:24:14,I've got a story about parking tickets.
00:24:14,00:24:16,So begins so many of them exactly go.
00:24:16,00:24:22,"Okay, so this is from January this year, and it was from the BBC News website."
00:24:22,00:24:27,A traffic warden is being investigated after a parking ticket was placed on a wheelie bin.
00:24:27,00:24:32,The warden was accused of bizarre behaviour.
00:24:32,00:24:36,"So one witness said this, it appeared the warden slapped the plastic ticket envelope on"
00:24:36,00:24:40,the bin in a moment of high jinks after a member of the public pointed out it was on double
00:24:40,00:24:41,yellow lines.
00:24:41,00:24:42,So it's a joke.
00:24:42,00:24:43,"It's just a silly joke, yeah."
00:24:43,00:24:46,"But then the response, this is in Camarthen."
00:24:46,00:24:51,"The Marvinshire Council Traffic and Safety Manager, John McEvoy, said, although this was"
00:24:51,00:24:54,"meant as a humorous incident, we take this kind of thing very seriously and have launched"
00:24:54,00:24:58,a formal investigation into the conduct of the officer.
00:24:58,00:25:05,"Although this is meant as a humorous incident, we are still the arseholes, you think we are?"
00:25:05,00:25:10,"I have some stuff on weird laws and slightly strange punishments, if that's okay."
00:25:10,00:25:15,"The hit heights, apparently, they had a rule where anyone found guilty of committing"
00:25:15,00:25:17,a sex act with a dog or pig would be killed.
00:25:17,00:25:23,And so your own David Carrenzo gear?
00:25:23,00:25:27,"But if it was with a horse or a mule, the only punishment that they could give out was"
00:25:27,00:25:31,that you were no longer allowed to be in the presence of the king.
00:25:31,00:25:32,Wow.
00:25:32,00:25:33,That's good.
00:25:33,00:25:34,"Nice, look."
00:25:34,00:25:41,"And if the king, sorry, if the king, if the pig mounted the human, then no one would be"
00:25:41,00:25:42,punished at all.
00:25:42,00:25:44,It had to be the human who was sitting there.
00:25:44,00:25:47,"Well, how would the king - is that his opening question to everyone?"
00:25:47,00:25:48,You fucked a horse.
00:25:48,00:25:49,I think it's that.
00:25:49,00:25:53,Because you could just be in an audience of the king and it doesn't get to him that you
00:25:53,00:25:54,did it.
00:25:54,00:25:55,That's a good point.
00:25:55,00:25:56,"Yeah, I don't know."
00:25:56,00:25:59,He was very close with the horse community.
00:25:59,00:26:00,They reported all these things.
00:26:00,00:26:01,Poopington Post.
00:26:01,00:26:04,"Oh, that was a good one."
00:26:04,00:26:08,That's really good.
00:26:08,00:26:13,"It's good, but it has."
00:26:13,00:26:17,So do you know about the guy who invented the double yellow lines?
00:26:17,00:26:18,No.
00:26:18,00:26:24,"This is a guy called George Bamber and this was in the late 19th century, so the 1880s."
00:26:24,00:26:29,"And he based the double yellow line, he was a farmer and he based the design on the markings"
00:26:29,00:26:31,he put on his sheep.
00:26:31,00:26:33,So he used to strike his sheep with double yellow lines.
00:26:33,00:26:37,And he noticed that no one ever walked on his sheep and parked on them.
00:26:37,00:26:39,I thought this is something.
00:26:39,00:26:44,"Actually, he wanted to keep the entrance to his farm clear on market day so people would"
00:26:44,00:26:45,come in and buy his produce.
00:26:45,00:26:47,"So he thought, what design could I use?"
00:26:47,00:26:50,"Oh, there's yellow lines from the sheep and he drew them out."
00:26:50,00:26:53,"And it really caught on in his village to the mayor of his town, started using these"
00:26:53,00:26:56,double yellow lines to stop people parking in undesirable places.
00:26:56,00:27:01,"But he received a 10% commission for a number of years on, like whenever the double yellow"
00:27:01,00:27:05,"lines were used that he'd taken from the sheep, he got a commission on them."
00:27:05,00:27:06,That's amazing.
00:27:06,00:27:07,Isn't that cool?
00:27:07,00:27:08,That's really cool.
00:27:08,00:27:10,"I think because I would have thought it was based on the single yellow line, but you're"
00:27:10,00:27:11,saying that was invented first.
00:27:11,00:27:12,No.
00:27:12,00:27:13,Double yellow line came first.
00:27:13,00:27:14,That is amazing.
00:27:14,00:27:15,Yeah.
00:27:15,00:27:16,Yeah.
00:27:16,00:27:17,It's like hearing that Rocky 2 was made before Rocky.
00:27:17,00:27:19,And Rocky 2 was so good.
00:27:19,00:27:24,I thought we should do all one.
00:27:24,00:27:29,"Oh, we're going to have to move on to our dex facts."
00:27:29,00:27:31,You guys got any more?
00:27:31,00:27:32,All right.
00:27:32,00:27:33,Let's do it.
00:27:33,00:27:36,It's time for our final fact of the evening and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.
00:27:36,00:27:43,My fact is that female corn earworm moths go invisible after sex.
00:27:43,00:27:46,So this needs a bit of explaining.
00:27:46,00:27:53,"Basically, when, so corn earworm moths are a kind of moth, and when males mate with females,"
00:27:53,00:27:59,"they have a protein in their semen, which makes the female invisible to other males."
00:27:59,00:28:04,So it gets into the female's body and it inhibits all pheromone production immediately.
00:28:04,00:28:08,And the males only can tell when females are run by smell.
00:28:08,00:28:09,They don't have very good vision at all.
00:28:09,00:28:11,They can't really see other females.
00:28:11,00:28:16,So it's a self-preservation thing by the male who's done the mating.
00:28:16,00:28:19,"He thinks, well, I want this female off the market."
00:28:19,00:28:22,So he just makes the female invisible to other males.
00:28:22,00:28:27,Why didn't he just paint double yellow lines on that?
00:28:27,00:28:31,So this is from a book called Nature's Nether Regions.
00:28:31,00:28:36,"I called Menno Shelte Huisen, I hope I'm pronouncing his name right."
00:28:36,00:28:39,And I just find that incredible.
00:28:39,00:28:40,That's amazing.
00:28:40,00:28:41,Totally insane.
00:28:41,00:28:42,Yeah.
00:28:42,00:28:46,"So basically, there are all kinds of animals which do incredible, strange things through the"
00:28:46,00:28:47,medium of sex.
00:28:47,00:28:51,So banana flies are a kind of fly.
00:28:51,00:28:52,And male banana flies.
00:28:52,00:28:55,Not kind of banana.
00:28:55,00:28:58,Good.
00:28:58,00:29:02,"So when male banana flies have sex with female banana flies, they deposit a seamen in"
00:29:02,00:29:03,the female.
00:29:03,00:29:09,And that contains a chemical which makes the female go completely off all other males.
00:29:09,00:29:12,So they start kicking away other males and then they give off a scent to make themselves
00:29:12,00:29:13,unattractive.
00:29:13,00:29:15,And it lasts for a week.
00:29:15,00:29:17,"It's not actually that long, is it?"
00:29:17,00:29:19,"It is if you're a banana fly, I think."
00:29:19,00:29:21,Completely kills their sex life.
00:29:21,00:29:24,"I mean, how much action are these females getting?"
00:29:24,00:29:27,"Well, some in sex do all the mating on a single day."
00:29:27,00:29:28,"Yeah, okay."
00:29:28,00:29:29,"Yeah, yeah."
00:29:29,00:29:30,"No, sorry."
00:29:30,00:29:36,"I read that female beetles, they quench their thirst through sex."
00:29:36,00:29:41,And it's because of the seamen and the fluids in the seamen because they get very dehydrated.
00:29:41,00:29:45,"And so when they have sex, it's actually just like having a drink for them."
00:29:45,00:29:49,"That's the reason we all do it, don't we?"
00:29:49,00:29:53,Sometimes the tap is too far away.
00:29:53,00:30:04,So some in sex do all the mating.
00:30:04,00:30:10,So bees and ants do all the mating for a lifetime in a single day when the queen does all her
00:30:10,00:30:11,mating.
00:30:11,00:30:19,"And the males sort of try and fight each other with seamen to do rivalry, basically."
00:30:19,00:30:23,"And some queens, if they've mated with a male and they like that male, they can secrete"
00:30:23,00:30:29,"a fluid to protect that male's seamen from the rival sperm, basically."
00:30:29,00:30:34,"And the scientist who found this out is called Boris Bear, from the University of Western"
00:30:34,00:30:35,Australia.
00:30:35,00:30:40,"And he was asked whether this might happen in humans, whether human women could do such"
00:30:40,00:30:41,a thing.
00:30:41,00:30:42,And he said that he doubted it.
00:30:42,00:30:49,"And he said, to my knowledge, women do not copulate with 90 mates in half an hour."
00:30:49,00:30:52,In his limited experience.
00:30:52,00:30:57,We are learning a lot about you to learn how to do this.
00:30:57,00:31:03,"So the New Zealand giraffe weevil, which it's a weevil, not a giraffe."
00:31:03,00:31:07,The way that they mate is like you get two weevils and they fight against each other and usually
00:31:07,00:31:09,the biggest weevil wins.
00:31:09,00:31:11,But there are little weevils that kind of sneak around.
00:31:11,00:31:16,"And when there's two males fighting over a female, that weevil goes in and then steals"
00:31:16,00:31:19,the female while she's like kind of watching the fight.
00:31:19,00:31:23,And the female actually ends up having sex with the smallest weevil.
00:31:23,00:31:24,Wow.
00:31:24,00:31:33,She actually goes for lesser of two weevils.
00:31:33,00:31:38,I've never seen you look more disappointed in me than I.
00:31:38,00:31:39,That was incredible.
00:31:39,00:31:44,Mass suicide was committed tonight.
00:31:44,00:31:48,"Here's a really, really weird thing, an interesting thing about flies, baby flies."
00:31:48,00:31:55,"Baby flies can get characteristics from males who have had sex with their mother, but not"
00:31:55,00:31:56,their father.
00:31:56,00:32:02,"So a male who's had sex with the mother much, much earlier can still give characteristics"
00:32:02,00:32:03,to the fly.
00:32:03,00:32:04,Wow.
00:32:04,00:32:05,Wow.
00:32:05,00:32:06,"Well, we don't know."
00:32:06,00:32:07,It's really new research.
00:32:07,00:32:09,But that is unbelievably interesting.
00:32:09,00:32:11,But what's a characteristic for them?
00:32:11,00:32:15,"So say, for instance, the female fly had sex with a really big fly."
00:32:15,00:32:16,Yeah.
00:32:16,00:32:18,And then nothing came from it.
00:32:18,00:32:22,"And then the father, well, and you know, being a little scrawny fly, then the baby might have"
00:32:22,00:32:27,"the bigness of the original guy who she had sex with, even though it's not his actually"
00:32:27,00:32:28,father.
00:32:28,00:32:29,"Oh, wow."
00:32:29,00:32:30,This sounds very suspect.
00:32:30,00:32:34,Are we sure this isn't just a lot of women cheating on their husbands?
00:32:34,00:32:35,No.
00:32:35,00:32:37,"No, it's new research."
00:32:37,00:32:39,It's why this baby's ginger.
00:32:39,00:32:41,That research.
00:32:41,00:32:48,"Yeah, it's called telegony."
00:32:48,00:32:52,"And it used to be believed by humans, by people."
00:32:52,00:32:57,"In ancient Greek time, people thought that your children would have things from whoever"
00:32:57,00:32:59,"you had sex with, whether it was the father or not."
00:32:59,00:33:00,Wow.
00:33:00,00:33:01,"And it was thought for a long, long time."
00:33:01,00:33:04,"And then it was shown to be not true in humans, but they've recently found that it might"
00:33:04,00:33:05,be true.
00:33:05,00:33:06,Probably is true in flies.
00:33:06,00:33:07,Wow.
00:33:07,00:33:08,That's so cool.
00:33:08,00:33:12,"It was a wrong belief, and it was just completely wrong for no reason, and then it turned out we"
00:33:12,00:33:13,were right all along.
00:33:13,00:33:16,It's very satisfying.
00:33:16,00:33:18,Norwegian rats sperm.
00:33:18,00:33:22,They can join forces with each other and become a super sperm.
00:33:22,00:33:26,"They have little hook-shaped heads and hundreds of them just hook onto each other and say, guys,"
00:33:26,00:33:27,we can do this together.
00:33:27,00:33:29,And then they swim faster as a single.
00:33:29,00:33:30,What?
00:33:30,00:33:31,It's like the power rangers.
00:33:31,00:33:32,You remember when they combine forces?
00:33:32,00:33:33,"Oh, yeah."
00:33:33,00:33:39,To make a larger power ranger. It's much like that. And that's why Andy never did any more
00:33:39,00:33:42,babysitting.
00:33:42,00:33:45,"Naked mole rats, but have you guys all seen naked mole rats?"
00:33:45,00:33:49,"Because I mean, they're just so extraordinary, and basically every single way."
00:33:49,00:33:56,"But their sperm are also bizarre, so only 7% of naked mole rats sperm can swim."
00:33:56,00:34:01,"So they ejaculate, and then the vast majority of their sperm just like flails and flutes"
00:34:01,00:34:06,"around, and like drowns, or doesn't make it anywhere, only 0.1% I think can swim really"
00:34:06,00:34:07,fast enough to get anywhere.
00:34:07,00:34:11,"So they're just constantly ejaculating useless, useless sperm."
00:34:11,00:34:14,"But they are immune to all cancer, so it's like a trade-off."
00:34:14,00:34:16,"Yeah, swings and..."
00:34:16,00:34:17,Yeah.
00:34:17,00:34:27,"Up to 90% of human males sperm, as opposed to human females sperm, obviously, has two heads"
00:34:27,00:34:31,"or two tails, or is completely deformed in other ways."
00:34:31,00:34:38,"There are very few, which are, you know, the perfect guys, you see, on the posters."
00:34:38,00:34:45,I just think there are unrealistic standards of beauty for sperm.
00:34:45,00:34:51,"Human semen is... I'm sorry about this, but it is really amazing."
00:34:51,00:34:53,Don't apologise.
00:34:53,00:35:00,"I'll send you the dry cleaning bit, I'm going to call it quits."
00:35:00,00:35:06,"It contains proteins, ladies and gentlemen, that can forge a kind of mating plug."
00:35:06,00:35:10,"Like other animals have mating plugs that stop other males from impregnating females,"
00:35:10,00:35:14,but the proteins in human semen can do a similar kind of thing.
00:35:14,00:35:19,And it also contains chemical compounds that prevent the sperm cells from becoming over
00:35:19,00:35:20,enthusiastic.
00:35:20,00:35:23,"I'm not quite sure what that means, but..."
00:35:23,00:35:30,"Does it sort of overshoot past the edge, end up in the kidney or something?"
00:35:30,00:35:36,"So, there was a question on Yahoo Answers, which I never know people are joking on Yahoo Answers,"
00:35:36,00:35:41,"but someone posted a question saying, ""I ran out of shampoo and I don't have any money,"
00:35:41,00:35:43,"have no choice and I have to go to work tomorrow."""
00:35:43,00:35:46,"Yes, males like feces."
00:35:46,00:35:49,Can I just use sperm as my shampoo?
00:35:49,00:36:01,"The next post was the next day from the same guy, ""Well, no one asked me about the feces smell at least."""
00:36:01,00:36:07,"Okay, we're going to wrap up, okay, that's it, that's all of our facts, thank you so much for coming tonight everybody."
00:36:07,00:36:10,"If you want to get in contact with us about the things we said over the course of this podcast,"

00:36:20,00:36:26,"Yep, and if there's a little snagger about the fact she's not on Twitter, still not on Twitter, come believe it."
00:36:26,00:36:32,"And if you want to listen to all of our previous episodes, you can head to no such thing as a fish.com"
