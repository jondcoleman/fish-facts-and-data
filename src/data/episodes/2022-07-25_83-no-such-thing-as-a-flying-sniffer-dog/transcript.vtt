WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 Hey everybody, before we get going, we have two bits of news to give you.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.280
 One very big, Stephen Frye is stepping down from QI and is going to be replaced by the

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:15.920
 incredible Sandy Toxwig, and so the final ever Stephen Frye hosted QI series starts

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.920
 tonight, October 16th at 10pm on BBC2.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:20.920
 So tune in.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.920
 Okay, news number two.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.560
 So if you don't want to watch a really smart person tell you interesting things on a Friday

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.840
 night, then you could watch a bunch of idiots tell you equally

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.480
 interesting things on Sunday night in Brighton.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.840
 We are doing our podcast, no such thing as a fish show at the Brighton Comedy Festival.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.280
 It's a 5pm on Sunday evening, and also in Brighton this weekend, QI's chief gnome founder,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.200
 creator, top dog, John Lloyd is going to be performing his show, Fresh from the Edinburgh

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.280
 Fringe, and here's a little taster of him.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.160
 He happens to be right here with us now.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.160
 Hi John.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.160
 Hello.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.760
 Yep, so if you enjoyed that, there's 59 more minutes of that kind of gold coming to you.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.640
 Go see his show as Emperor of the Prawns.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.840
 And now on with this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:25.400
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.120
 week coming to you from the Lowry and Solford.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.400
 My name is Dan Schreiber, joining me on the stage as the three regular elves, it's Andy

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:41.640
 Murray, Anichezinski and James Harkin.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.320
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.760
 the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go, starting with My Fact.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.680
 My Fact this week is the seventh time Park Ranger Roy Sullivan was struck by lightning,

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:04.600
 coincided with the 22nd time he fought off a bear with a stick.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.880
 So this guy is a park ranger.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.000
 He was, I think he was fishing at the time, so he was just out there.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.360
 He's been struck six times before, and then the lightning was coming.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.000
 He just thought I'll just stay here, probably nothing bad will happen.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.520
 God struck by lightning, was running back to his car, and suddenly a bear comes out

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.520
 of nowhere.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.920
 Jesus Christ, has to fight off a bear and then went back home.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:37.960
 His diary must have been amazing, bear, bear, lightning, lightning and bear.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.200
 But he, as I said, he's been struck seven times.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.120
 He was almost struck eight times, but the eighth time when he should have been struck, it

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.120
 hit his wife instead.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.120
 It sounds awful.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.560
 It sounds terrible because obviously he was interviewed because he was very, he became

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.560
 well known for this, and he said, naturally, people avoid me.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.440
 I was walking with the chief ranger one day, and lightning struck way off, and he said,

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.560
 "I'll see you later, Roy."

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.320
 Then he said, "There's a restaurant on Loft Mountain that even it's just overcast, they

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.920
 won't let me in."

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.000
 It sounds awful.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.680
 It sounds terrible because at time number four, this is August 1973, I think he died

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.840
 in the early 80s, possibly, but in August 1973, he got in his car and he accelerated because

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.320
 there was a cloud forming, and he was very nervous about storm clouds by this point.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:39.720
 And he out ran it, stopped the car, got out of it to watch the storm hit by lightning again.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.720
 They have a full list of all the times that he was...

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.720
 The first time he lost his big toenail.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.720
 Right.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.720
 To lightning.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.720
 Oh, it's a big toenail.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:48.720
 Yeah, a big toenail.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.640
 At the time, a bolt came out of a small low-lying cloud, hit him on the head through his hat,

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.880
 set his hair on fire again, again.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.880
 Not in ten feet out of his car, and not his left shoe off.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.360
 Do you know why shoes come off when you get hit by lightning?

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.480
 This is because you watch cartoons.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.240
 So for example, when it hits a tree, lightning, it will sometimes explode a tree if the moisture

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.720
 is in the middle of the tree, because it takes the path of least resistance.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.400
 People obviously, there's moisture everywhere and we're 70% liquid, so it often dissipates

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.040
 all over your skin.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.720
 But when it does that, all the sweat and the moisture on you boil into steam immediately

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.040
 and sometimes so much steam is produced that your shoes will be blown off.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.040
 That's what causes it.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.000
 So he got struck seven times.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 Yeah.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.520
 I found somebody who's been struck even more.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.520
 Really?

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.400
 There's a guy called Melvin Roberts from South Carolina, and he at least claims to have

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.600
 been struck ten times.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.320
 He was in the news in 2011 for being hit six times, and his wife says that he's been struck

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.080
 another four times since.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.080
 By lightning, definitely.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.680
 She's not just by thinking really about it.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.240
 I think I found a group of people who've been struck by lightning even more than that.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.240
 Well, really?

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.240
 Yeah.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.240
 So I was reading the 14 times.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.080
 It's an amazing magazine, and in it, they had a small story where someone had written

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:18.240
 in to contest the fact that Roy Sullivan was the most struck person of all time, and what

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.960
 they said was that in 1995, a group of explorers who were up on a mountain mountaineer's got

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:29.760
 struck twenty times in sixteen hours, a group of five, and they were in their tent, and they

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.760
 all describe the moment that they were struck, and they were just in there getting struck

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.280
 over and over again, seventeen times, and we got to get out of there, out of here.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.720
 There's a rescue shelter down the mountain, so he started absailing, and while they were

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.440
 doing that, they were struck three more times on the absailed down.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.440
 Oh, my God.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.240
 To be fair, I do think you have to define that by five, though, at which point you haven't

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.240
 been record anymore.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.240
 Very good point.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.240
 Yeah.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.240
 It's all about the mass.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.480
 Sometimes goes from one person to another, as well.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.480
 No.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:02.880
 Or it can hit, for example, it can rebound off a tree and into a horse or whatever.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:03.880
 Yeah.

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.820
 I mean, then it's less likely to kill you, because at least some of the force has been

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:07.820
 dissipated.

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:08.820
 Yeah.

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:13.040
 Men account for 85% of lightning strikes, isn't that weird?

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.460
 And the National Weather Service in the US speculated that this might be because men tend

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:22.640
 to be unaware of all the dangers associated with lightning, more likely to be invulnerable

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:28.740
 situations, unwilling to be inconvenienced by the threat of lightning, and don't react

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:33.940
 quickly to the lightning threat, or any combination of these explanations.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:37.620
 So there's stupid, ignorant, big-headed, and they have very slow reactions.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.980
 No, she was just my interpretation, but I think that's the long and short of it.

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:47.260
 A man in Croatia has admitted that he has not gone outside after hearing thunder since

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:52.940
 lightning struck his penis in 2007.

00:06:52.940 --> 00:07:00.860
 Zoran Jurkovich, it's online, honestly.

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:06.420
 Zoran Jurkovich said, "My friends used to tease me, and I used to tease them back, saying

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:13.420
 my penis has extraordinary ability now, but it doesn't."

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:23.180
 It's hard to tease them back when you've just got a sort of child stumped.

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.540
 So I think there might be something about Croatia, God hates it or something, so there's

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:32.540
 a Croatian woman who has been left recently with a severely burned anus after a lightning

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:37.420
 strike, ended her mouth while she was cleaning her teeth and drinking water from the tap,

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:42.220
 came through the tap, ended her mouth, and then left through the anus so it could earth

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.260
 through the ground.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:50.140
 Apparently, so the report said she was wearing rubber-sold shoes, so once the lightning had entered

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:53.780
 through her mouth when she was drinking water from the tap, it took the easiest route and

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:56.940
 came out of her rectum to reach her rubber-sold shoes.

00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:04.780
 You know, speaking of lightning coming out the bum, there actually is a fabled worm called

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:11.700
 the Mongolian death worm, which is in Mongolia, and is it done?

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:12.700
 Is it?

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:17.900
 It's a massive worm, and all accounts of it say that it can shoot acid from its eyes and

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:19.700
 lightning bolts from its anus.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:20.700
 Accounts?

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:25.140
 I don't think they deserve the name "accounts."

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:28.500
 One really knows why lightning happens today.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:33.220
 We find, when you're at school, they tell you it's because clouds are rubbing together

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:37.580
 or whatever, and it kind of is that a little bit, but it's like ice going up in their clouds

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:40.820
 and water coming down or the other way around, and they rub against each other, and it causes

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.640
 like static electricity like you would have with a balloon.

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:47.260
 But no one really knows why it starts, and it's like a chain reaction that starts, and

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:51.700
 one theory you'll like this done, apparently there's a latest theory coming from Russia

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:56.620
 that it's cosmic rays, which come from outside the solar system and hit the earth, and that's

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:59.100
 what starts the lightning in the first place.

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:00.100
 Wow.

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:01.740
 And no one knows what causes cosmic rays, really.

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.060
 I mean, it could be supernovas or quasars or...

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:07.860
 The Mongolian death worm.

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:10.940
 We can't rule it out.

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:13.660
 Yeah, amazing.

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:17.260
 You know, America has two annual conferences for lightning strikes survivors.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:18.260
 Oh, really?

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:19.260
 Yeah.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.220
 It's actually about 80% of people struck by lightning actually survive...

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:23.220
 Yes, right.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:24.220
 Yes, it is.

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:27.180
 80% to 90% live, but it's not plain sailing after that.

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:30.980
 It's not as though you have burns and then you recover, it can scramble your memory, and

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:34.900
 there are all these long-term effects that we don't know about, and it just gets right

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:39.100
 into your cells, and there aren't enough cases that are studied in the medical literature

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:43.340
 to have a proper body of science, so it's a lot of guesswork, and yeah, there just isn't

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:46.260
 the money to try and work out what exactly has happened.

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:47.260
 Okay.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.180
 We're going to have to move on to our next fact in a minute.

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:51.380
 Is there anything else you guys want to add?

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:57.260
 Um, another thing that we can't explain is the lightning that happens at the beacon of

00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:01.180
 Mara Cabo, which is the most incredible place on the planet.

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:03.260
 So this is a place in Venezuela.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:10.500
 It's the Catatumbo River, I think in Venezuela, and it's one tiny spot where for 280 times

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:16.060
 an hour, for 10 hours a night, for 160 nights a year, lightning strikes this exact same

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:17.580
 spot, and nobody knows why.

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:24.420
 I reckon it could be Roy Sullivan doing some fishing, but isn't that weird, and it was mentioned

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:30.980
 first in a poem about Francis Drake in 1597, and Fisherman used it on this lake in Venezuela

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:35.020
 to light their way, so if they're going fishing, they just use this class and lightning storm

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:37.940
 to say, okay, well, there's the storm, yes, we go towards that, because that's where we'll

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:38.940
 get the best light.

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:39.940
 Slash die.

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:43.140
 Um, yeah, no one knows what happens.

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:44.140
 Wow.

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:45.140
 That's amazing.

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:49.180
 You read about that, and I think it replenishes the ozone layer, doesn't it?

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:52.980
 The biggest source of ozone on Earth, the biggest single source of ozone on Earth, so it's

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:53.980
 a good thing.

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:54.980
 Yeah, it's a good thing.

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:55.980
 That's so cool.

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:59.860
 Okay, we're going to move on to fact number two, and that is James Harkin.

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:06.380
 Okay, my fact this week is that this year, America's Hero Dog of the Year award was won

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:07.860
 by a cat.

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:08.860
 (Laughter)

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:12.860
 It can't have been a good night to be a dog.

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:19.300
 Yeah, so this is Tara the Cat, and I reckon some people will know it, or will at least know

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:22.660
 the cat itself because it's been a bit of an internet sensation.

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:25.940
 There was a young child being mulled by a dog next to a car.

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:30.300
 You might have seen the video on YouTube, and then this cat runs on and kind of scares the

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:35.060
 dog away, and then runs off again, and she became such a hero that she is now an honorary

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:36.060
 dog.

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:37.060
 Wow.

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:44.660
 What a way to reward her to invite her to a ceremony full of dogs, who now it was soft

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:46.060
 at a cat's one.

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:47.060
 It is amazing.

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:49.380
 She just full on runs into the dog.

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:50.380
 She just smashes her head.

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:51.380
 Have you guys seen that video?

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:52.380
 You must have done it right.

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:53.380
 Yeah, it's good.

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:54.380
 It's good to watch.

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:58.780
 Yeah, she got a few other awards, actually.

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:02.820
 She was invited by the local baseball team, the Bakersfield Blaze, because this was in

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:05.060
 Bakersfield in California.

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:10.500
 They invited her to throw the first pitch, not a way.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:11.780
 Yeah, and a baseball game.

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:12.780
 How did she do?

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:16.740
 Well, it said on the news report that she was assisted by her family.

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:22.460
 I watched it, and the family do a lot of assisting.

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:27.260
 It goes wrong about five times, and then basically a guy holding a cat throws a ball.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:28.260
 That's basically it.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:33.340
 But this video is the first YouTube video in history to reach 20 million views in five

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:34.340
 days.

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:37.580
 And the cat became a hero, and the dog was put down.

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:38.580
 Wasn't it?

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:39.580
 No way.

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:40.580
 Did you just bite it?

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:42.380
 It had been the child really badly on the leg.

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:43.380
 Yeah, OK, yeah.

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:46.100
 Sorry.

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.100
 On the dog side.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.100
 No, I'm not.

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:52.660
 Cats have a long and noble history of impersonating dogs, though, don't they?

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:55.420
 Because they bark, like, can bark like dogs.

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:58.580
 Like, if you have cats and dogs they've been together, then cats will learn to impersonate

00:12:58.580 --> 00:12:59.580
 dogs.

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:00.580
 OK, hang on.

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:01.580
 No, I've never--

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:02.580
 Yeah.

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:05.420
 I'm the Mongolian death one guy.

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:08.100
 If you basically look at a time into YouTube, cats bark like dogs.

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:13.300
 Are you sure that a cat can bark like a dog, and not that a dog can throw its voice?

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:17.740
 Dogs are actually amazing ventriloquists, and we've not realized.

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:21.100
 But there is a really good video on YouTube of a cat owner.

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:24.140
 I mean, I can't believe we're discussing YouTube memes, but let's do it.

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:29.380
 A cat owner who sneaks up behind her cat, filming her cat, sitting on a window ledge,

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:31.940
 looking outside at a dog, which obviously lives with the family.

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:34.260
 They all live for next door, so it's lived around it, and barking.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.140
 And it's honestly going, the cat's going, "Ruff, ruff, ruff."

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:38.660
 And it keeps doing this, loads.

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:42.300
 And then the person who's holding the camera sort of clears her throat, and the cat hears,

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:44.660
 and looks around and starts to be, "Mew!"

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:47.900
 [LAUGHTER]

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:52.100
 And the science came up with some bullshit expression, like, "Oh, she turned her vocal chords,

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:54.540
 she turned around, which changed the tenor of her voice."

00:13:54.540 --> 00:14:00.020
 But it's quite clearly the cat going, "Woop see, I've been caught right in the act of impersonating

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:01.020
 a dog."

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:02.020
 [LAUGHTER]

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:06.660
 So, just on heroic dogs, I have a couple of different kinds of heroic dogs that we all know

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:07.660
 about.

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:09.820
 So, bomb detecting dogs, I mean, how about guide dogs.

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:13.420
 There is only one, I believe, there's great piece in the Guardian about this.

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:17.300
 There is only one airborne nut allergy dog in the UK.

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:18.300
 [LAUGHTER]

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:20.140
 Sorry, the dog was airborne on the nut.

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:23.140
 [LAUGHTER]

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:25.140
 My fault, should have clarified.

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:26.980
 So, there's a woman also called Tara, actually.

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:30.900
 Tara Bedford, she has an incredibly bad nut allergy, so bad that even the smell of

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:32.940
 nuts can trigger a reaction.

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:36.660
 She says, "Any rustle on a train or a bus, and it's, what are they opening?

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:37.660
 Should I move?"

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:41.700
 She can't go to the cinema, she can't go to a catch, she can't go in a plane because someone

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:44.740
 opens a pack of the peanuts and she's dead, she's in a plane.

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:50.900
 She had to go to any 40 times in four years, but the story has a happy ending because there

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:58.660
 was a labrador who had failed a guide dog test for overuse of the nose, put them together,

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:03.780
 and now the dog forcefully pushes her whenever the dog smells nuts, a peanut or a nut she's

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:04.780
 allergic to.

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:06.780
 So it's a very good ending.

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:07.780
 Seeing nose dog.

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:08.780
 Seeing nose dog, yeah.

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:09.780
 Wow, that's so cool.

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:10.780
 Wow.

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:11.780
 And he flies as well.

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:12.780
 And he's...

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:13.780
 [LAUGHTER]

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:15.780
 Russian.

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:17.780
 Sorry.

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:19.780
 Russia employs sniffer cats.

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:20.780
 Really?

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:21.780
 Really?

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:27.380
 Yeah, there's some sniffer cats in Russia, and they're looking for kind of Russian Mafia

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:34.300
 that might be smuggling fish for the caviar down in the south of Russia.

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:37.100
 And the most famous one, the first one was called the Rusek.

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:40.660
 And Rusek died when he was hit by a criminal's car quite recently.

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:44.660
 And the locals thought that it might be a contract killing because the week before, another

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:48.820
 cat called Barsik was killed after he was poisoned by a mouse.

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:49.820
 What?

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.820
 Sorry, with a mouse.

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:52.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:58.820
 Yeah.

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:03.580
 I was looking into sort of the latest in cat news.

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:06.740
 And I headed to a place I discovered a few podcasts ago.

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:11.180
 I headed to Pussington Post.

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:14.540
 Just a few recent headlines.

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:17.260
 Cat ignores frogs sitting on his paw.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:18.260
 That's...

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.380
 That was September 17th, if you want to look that one up.

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:27.020
 If you're into cat news, which you obviously are, there's this guy who is constantly updating

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:28.340
 us on cat news.

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:34.500
 He runs a Twitter feed called NBA Catwatch, and the entire Twitter feed is devoted to finding

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:38.420
 out what cats are owned by basketball players.

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:40.180
 And he's been going for quite a while now.

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:44.940
 So he said, it's sort of a typical dumb Twitter joke, but the more he thought about it, something

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:45.940
 caught in my brain.

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:50.500
 I'd be watching a basketball game, and I'd start to think about who does owner cat

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:51.940
 on this team.

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:57.300
 He said, I'm aware that it's ridiculous trying to find NBA players cats on social media.

00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:00.020
 However, it's my niche, and I got there first.

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.020
 [LAUGHTER]

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:07.660
 And yet, no one has ever got the second out there.

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:16.100
 I found a really exciting Guinness Book World Record, which is for world-mousing champion.

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:18.380
 And the winner of this, the current champion of this award.

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:19.380
 It's a dog.

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:20.380
 It's a dog.

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:24.900
 It's a cat, but it's amazing that this is an actual record that's being held.

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:32.700
 So it's a cat called Towsr, and Towsr was stationed at Distillery in Scotland, where Grouse

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:34.500
 Whiskey is made.

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:39.700
 And during her reign, she killed 28,899 mice.

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:40.700
 No way.

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:42.300
 And so that's a Guinness World Record.

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:43.300
 No way.

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:44.300
 And then she died.

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:47.940
 So she got taken over by another cat called Amber, who's been there for 20 years now, and

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:51.580
 who they've said was not known to have caught a single mouse.

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:54.780
 They've all been caught already.

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:56.300
 She's just got there at a first angle.

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:59.700
 Well, there's not much to do here, isn't it?

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:02.060
 Can I tell you about a couple of more little dog things?

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:02.900
 Yes, please.

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:08.140
 So there's another kind of dog, which is a Corpse Detection Dog.

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:11.820
 So please use them to find bodies, things like this.

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:15.700
 And they have to be trained, but you can't train them obviously on real cases, because

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:17.180
 they're very few of those.

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:23.060
 So they're trained by wrapping up pigs bodies in shower curtains.

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:26.060
 And there's a man who runs a search company, his name is Mick Swindles, and he says he

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:30.100
 always puts clothes on the pigs, too, for added realism.

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:32.140
 Insert your own David Cameron joke here.

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:33.140
 Oh, God.

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:41.900
 Well, this is the thing.

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:45.740
 He said of them, because he puts clothes on them, and he said, people say, why do you always

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:47.420
 put them in a skirt?

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:49.820
 Have you ever tried putting trousers on a pig?

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:57.020
 So presumably these cat's are just now really good at detecting clothes, pigs, dogs are

00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:02.020
 really good at detecting clothes, pigs, and not that good at detecting human causes.

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:04.980
 We're very similar to pigs in many ways.

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:05.980
 Speak yourself.

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:06.980
 OK.

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:08.740
 We're going to have to move on in a sec.

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:09.740
 Can I say one thing?

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:14.980
 This original fact was in Bakersfield in California, and so I found another story from

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:15.980
 Bakersfield.

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:16.980
 It's just a quick one.

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:22.780
 It's a guy called Mr. Slivers, and he was arrested, and they interviewed him afterwards.

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:27.740
 And this way he said, he said, I was just bored, and I decided I wanted to be a cat burglar.

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:32.220
 So I kicked in the window and tried to steal the lion, but it was too heavy, so I stole the

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:34.220
 cat.

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:37.900
 And he wanted to be a cat burglar, and thought that a cat burglar is something that steals

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:38.900
 cats.

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:43.900
 I'm more interested in the home that owns both the lion and the cat.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:44.900
 So it was a museum.

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:45.900
 It was a museum.

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:46.900
 Oh.

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:47.900
 Sorry.

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:48.900
 Right.

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:49.900
 OK.

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:50.900
 Got it.

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:55.340
 Otherwise, I don't think you'd be saying the lion is too heavy.

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:57.740
 Weight is the least of your problems.

00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:03.340
 That lion was way too bitey on my face.

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:04.740
 OK.

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:08.420
 It's time for fact number three, and that is Chazinsky.

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:09.420
 Yeah.

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:16.180
 Fact is that the earliest known penalty for illegal parking was to be impaled on a stake.

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:17.180
 Yeah.

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:22.780
 It's firm, it's firm, but it's fair.

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:29.060
 And if you appeal, it's a smaller stake.

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:33.020
 So this was actually in 700 BC.

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:37.060
 This is the earliest parking restriction I can find, so it's in Nineveh, which is the

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:38.780
 Assyrian capital.

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:42.180
 And the parking restriction was put in place by King Sinacarib.

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:47.140
 And we have a stone tablet where he's laid out the restriction, and it says, Royal Road

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:54.140
 let no man decrease it, or let no man lessen it, this Royal Road, and on pain of being impaled

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:55.140
 on a stake.

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:58.620
 And you got impaled on a stake if you did park on the Royal Road in your chariot, obviously

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:00.420
 not your motor car.

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:04.060
 And impaled on a stake and then planted in your own garden so that people who were coming

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:09.420
 to visit you could go, oh, I guess he's not available for tea.

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:11.060
 Wow, planted in your own garden.

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:14.260
 Would you have a little label sticking out like you get on those plants?

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:15.260
 Yeah.

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:16.660
 Yeah, with the species.

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:19.260
 This is a Norman.

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:24.100
 Yeah, Sinacarib, he was, he's most famous for moving his capital city to Nineveh, like

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:28.700
 you say, and had like a really amazing capital city then he had like gardens.

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:32.100
 They think it might be in the Hanging Gardens, if anyone was there.

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.580
 And yeah, he was just an extremely opulent man.

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:40.140
 Apparently he had a piece of Noah's Ark which he worshipped as a god, and he once wrote

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:45.940
 about his enemies, their testicles I cut off, and tore out their privates like the seeds

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:48.540
 of cucumbers.

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.940
 He was good with a simile, actually.

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:56.540
 Sounds like he was very bad at making sandwiches.

00:21:56.540 --> 00:22:07.740
 You selectively shave the outside of a cucumber, then you slot it at home in the sandwich.

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:12.580
 He actually, so he was not a humble man because he did create these incredible gardens.

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:16.340
 I mean, he's, I think people should know more about Sinacarib and very little is written

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:17.340
 about him.

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:21.140
 But a lot of historians now think that the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, as you say, were

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:25.780
 his gardens, and he irrigated the mountains all around, so he built this incredible canal

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:31.100
 that stretched 50 kilometers up into the mountains, and which irrigated his whole amazing new city.

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:35.540
 But he was pretty cocky about it, so even on the signposts where he said you'll be impaled

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:39.380
 on a steak or cucumber or whatever if you part here.

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:43.180
 Then the little signposts then went on to list his achievements.

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:48.820
 Explaining Sinacarib is a king of the world, favorite of the gods, holder of invincible weapons

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:50.460
 and architect of urban design.

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:53.940
 So I think that's quite a piece of it.

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:57.420
 On those signs you put up here, here's what I've achieved, guys.

00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:58.420
 Wow.

00:22:58.420 --> 00:22:59.420
 Yeah.

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:00.420
 That's amazing.

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:03.540
 Do you know, in Britain, the first ever parking ticket that was given?

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:04.540
 No.

00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:06.900
 Okay, so it was in September 1960.

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:08.220
 They set this up.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:09.220
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:12.500
 It was quite like where it was like an established proper where parking attendance went

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.060
 out.

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:19.660
 And the first ever ticket was given to a Dr. Thomas Craton who was answering an emergency

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:23.420
 call to help a heart attack victim at a West End Hotel.

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:24.420
 So he raced there.

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:25.420
 He got out.

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:26.620
 When he came back, he had a ticket.

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:31.060
 And there was so much public outcry that they said, okay, you haven't got a ticket.

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:32.300
 That was the first ticket.

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:39.620
 Could you imagine the, how was your first day, the clocked up pretty bad.

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:43.500
 But the first parking ticket in America was also had to be overturned.

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:44.500
 Oh, really?

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:46.020
 Maybe parking tickets are just a failed enterprise.

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:48.060
 Yeah, this was a reverend, actually.

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:53.340
 The reverend CH North of the third Penta Costal Honest Church.

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:56.740
 And it was a newly installed parking meter, the country's first parking meter.

00:23:56.740 --> 00:24:01.180
 And he just ran into a shop to get change and by the time he'd come out, he got a ticket.

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:03.900
 And he complained to the courts and had it overturned.

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:04.900
 Wow.

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:08.260
 It would be pretty hard to get it overturned in the old days when you're being impaled

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:10.260
 on a stage.

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:14.140
 I've got a story about parking tickets.

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:16.980
 So begins so many of them exactly go.

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:22.100
 Okay, so this is from January this year, and it was from the BBC News website.

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:27.540
 A traffic warden is being investigated after a parking ticket was placed on a wheelie bin.

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:32.380
 The warden was accused of bizarre behaviour.

00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:36.620
 So one witness said this, it appeared the warden slapped the plastic ticket envelope on

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:40.500
 the bin in a moment of high jinks after a member of the public pointed out it was on double

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:41.500
 yellow lines.

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:42.500
 So it's a joke.

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:43.500
 It's just a silly joke, yeah.

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:46.580
 But then the response, this is in Camarthen.

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:51.260
 The Marvinshire Council Traffic and Safety Manager, John McEvoy, said, although this was

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:54.940
 meant as a humorous incident, we take this kind of thing very seriously and have launched

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:58.580
 a formal investigation into the conduct of the officer.

00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:05.180
 Although this is meant as a humorous incident, we are still the arseholes, you think we are?

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:10.940
 I have some stuff on weird laws and slightly strange punishments, if that's okay.

00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:15.180
 The hit heights, apparently, they had a rule where anyone found guilty of committing

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:17.820
 a sex act with a dog or pig would be killed.

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:23.500
 And so your own David Carrenzo gear?

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:27.100
 But if it was with a horse or a mule, the only punishment that they could give out was

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:31.140
 that you were no longer allowed to be in the presence of the king.

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:32.140
 Wow.

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:33.140
 That's good.

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:34.140
 Nice, look.

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:41.220
 And if the king, sorry, if the king, if the pig mounted the human, then no one would be

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:42.220
 punished at all.

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:44.220
 It had to be the human who was sitting there.

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:47.300
 Well, how would the king - is that his opening question to everyone?

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:48.300
 You fucked a horse.

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:49.700
 I think it's that.

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:53.980
 Because you could just be in an audience of the king and it doesn't get to him that you

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:54.980
 did it.

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:55.980
 That's a good point.

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:56.980
 Yeah, I don't know.

00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:59.620
 He was very close with the horse community.

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:00.980
 They reported all these things.

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:01.980
 Poopington Post.

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:04.140
 Oh, that was a good one.

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:08.140
 That's really good.

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:13.380
 It's good, but it has.

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:17.460
 So do you know about the guy who invented the double yellow lines?

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:18.460
 No.

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:24.780
 This is a guy called George Bamber and this was in the late 19th century, so the 1880s.

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:29.380
 And he based the double yellow line, he was a farmer and he based the design on the markings

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:31.100
 he put on his sheep.

00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:33.300
 So he used to strike his sheep with double yellow lines.

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:37.300
 And he noticed that no one ever walked on his sheep and parked on them.

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:39.100
 I thought this is something.

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:44.060
 Actually, he wanted to keep the entrance to his farm clear on market day so people would

00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:45.420
 come in and buy his produce.

00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:47.460
 So he thought, what design could I use?

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:50.300
 Oh, there's yellow lines from the sheep and he drew them out.

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:53.620
 And it really caught on in his village to the mayor of his town, started using these

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:56.980
 double yellow lines to stop people parking in undesirable places.

00:26:56.980 --> 00:27:01.580
 But he received a 10% commission for a number of years on, like whenever the double yellow

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:05.020
 lines were used that he'd taken from the sheep, he got a commission on them.

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:06.020
 That's amazing.

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:07.020
 Isn't that cool?

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:08.020
 That's really cool.

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:10.460
 I think because I would have thought it was based on the single yellow line, but you're

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:11.460
 saying that was invented first.

00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:12.460
 No.

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:13.460
 Double yellow line came first.

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:14.460
 That is amazing.

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:15.460
 Yeah.

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:16.460
 Yeah.

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:17.460
 It's like hearing that Rocky 2 was made before Rocky.

00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:19.460
 And Rocky 2 was so good.

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:24.980
 I thought we should do all one.

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:29.340
 Oh, we're going to have to move on to our dex facts.

00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:31.340
 You guys got any more?

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:32.340
 All right.

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:33.340
 Let's do it.

00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:36.820
 It's time for our final fact of the evening and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:43.180
 My fact is that female corn earworm moths go invisible after sex.

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:46.620
 So this needs a bit of explaining.

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:53.660
 Basically, when, so corn earworm moths are a kind of moth, and when males mate with females,

00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:59.140
 they have a protein in their semen, which makes the female invisible to other males.

00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:04.580
 So it gets into the female's body and it inhibits all pheromone production immediately.

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:08.180
 And the males only can tell when females are run by smell.

00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:09.660
 They don't have very good vision at all.

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:11.460
 They can't really see other females.

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:16.980
 So it's a self-preservation thing by the male who's done the mating.

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:19.580
 He thinks, well, I want this female off the market.

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:22.820
 So he just makes the female invisible to other males.

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:27.860
 Why didn't he just paint double yellow lines on that?

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:31.900
 So this is from a book called Nature's Nether Regions.

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:36.980
 I called Menno Shelte Huisen, I hope I'm pronouncing his name right.

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:39.220
 And I just find that incredible.

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:40.220
 That's amazing.

00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:41.220
 Totally insane.

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:42.220
 Yeah.

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:46.180
 So basically, there are all kinds of animals which do incredible, strange things through the

00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:47.940
 medium of sex.

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:51.380
 So banana flies are a kind of fly.

00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:52.380
 And male banana flies.

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:55.140
 Not kind of banana.

00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:58.780
 Good.

00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:02.940
 So when male banana flies have sex with female banana flies, they deposit a seamen in

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:03.940
 the female.

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:09.140
 And that contains a chemical which makes the female go completely off all other males.

00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:12.900
 So they start kicking away other males and then they give off a scent to make themselves

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:13.900
 unattractive.

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:15.900
 And it lasts for a week.

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:17.940
 It's not actually that long, is it?

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:19.940
 It is if you're a banana fly, I think.

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:21.540
 Completely kills their sex life.

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:24.180
 I mean, how much action are these females getting?

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:27.140
 Well, some in sex do all the mating on a single day.

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:28.140
 Yeah, okay.

00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:29.140
 Yeah, yeah.

00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:30.140
 No, sorry.

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:36.460
 I read that female beetles, they quench their thirst through sex.

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:41.500
 And it's because of the seamen and the fluids in the seamen because they get very dehydrated.

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:45.180
 And so when they have sex, it's actually just like having a drink for them.

00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:49.620
 That's the reason we all do it, don't we?

00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:53.820
 Sometimes the tap is too far away.

00:29:53.820 --> 00:30:04.460
 So some in sex do all the mating.

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:10.340
 So bees and ants do all the mating for a lifetime in a single day when the queen does all her

00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:11.340
 mating.

00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:19.220
 And the males sort of try and fight each other with seamen to do rivalry, basically.

00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:23.800
 And some queens, if they've mated with a male and they like that male, they can secrete

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:29.780
 a fluid to protect that male's seamen from the rival sperm, basically.

00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:34.440
 And the scientist who found this out is called Boris Bear, from the University of Western

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:35.440
 Australia.

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:40.000
 And he was asked whether this might happen in humans, whether human women could do such

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.000
 a thing.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.000
 And he said that he doubted it.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:49.000
 And he said, to my knowledge, women do not copulate with 90 mates in half an hour.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.200
 In his limited experience.

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:57.840
 We are learning a lot about you to learn how to do this.

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:03.960
 So the New Zealand giraffe weevil, which it's a weevil, not a giraffe.

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:07.560
 The way that they mate is like you get two weevils and they fight against each other and usually

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:09.360
 the biggest weevil wins.

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:11.720
 But there are little weevils that kind of sneak around.

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:16.080
 And when there's two males fighting over a female, that weevil goes in and then steals

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:19.800
 the female while she's like kind of watching the fight.

00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:23.880
 And the female actually ends up having sex with the smallest weevil.

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:24.880
 Wow.

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:33.760
 She actually goes for lesser of two weevils.

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:38.960
 I've never seen you look more disappointed in me than I.

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:39.960
 That was incredible.

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:44.280
 Mass suicide was committed tonight.

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:48.800
 Here's a really, really weird thing, an interesting thing about flies, baby flies.

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:55.920
 Baby flies can get characteristics from males who have had sex with their mother, but not

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:56.920
 their father.

00:31:56.920 --> 00:32:02.640
 So a male who's had sex with the mother much, much earlier can still give characteristics

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:03.640
 to the fly.

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:04.640
 Wow.

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:05.640
 Wow.

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:06.640
 Well, we don't know.

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:07.640
 It's really new research.

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:09.360
 But that is unbelievably interesting.

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:11.520
 But what's a characteristic for them?

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:15.720
 So say, for instance, the female fly had sex with a really big fly.

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:16.720
 Yeah.

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.400
 And then nothing came from it.

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:22.520
 And then the father, well, and you know, being a little scrawny fly, then the baby might have

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:27.600
 the bigness of the original guy who she had sex with, even though it's not his actually

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:28.600
 father.

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:29.600
 Oh, wow.

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:30.600
 This sounds very suspect.

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:34.600
 Are we sure this isn't just a lot of women cheating on their husbands?

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:35.600
 No.

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:37.800
 No, it's new research.

00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:39.800
 It's why this baby's ginger.

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:41.800
 That research.

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:48.520
 Yeah, it's called telegony.

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:52.280
 And it used to be believed by humans, by people.

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:57.000
 In ancient Greek time, people thought that your children would have things from whoever

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.480
 you had sex with, whether it was the father or not.

00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:00.480
 Wow.

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:01.480
 And it was thought for a long, long time.

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:04.120
 And then it was shown to be not true in humans, but they've recently found that it might

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:05.120
 be true.

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:06.120
 Probably is true in flies.

00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:07.120
 Wow.

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:08.120
 That's so cool.

00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:12.000
 It was a wrong belief, and it was just completely wrong for no reason, and then it turned out we

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.000
 were right all along.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.400
 It's very satisfying.

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:18.640
 Norwegian rats sperm.

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:22.440
 They can join forces with each other and become a super sperm.

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:26.240
 They have little hook-shaped heads and hundreds of them just hook onto each other and say, guys,

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:27.560
 we can do this together.

00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:29.560
 And then they swim faster as a single.

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:30.560
 What?

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:31.560
 It's like the power rangers.

00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:32.560
 You remember when they combine forces?

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:33.560
 Oh, yeah.

00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:39.400
 To make a larger power ranger. It's much like that. And that's why Andy never did any more

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:42.400
 babysitting.

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:45.640
 Naked mole rats, but have you guys all seen naked mole rats?

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:49.800
 Because I mean, they're just so extraordinary, and basically every single way.

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:56.360
 But their sperm are also bizarre, so only 7% of naked mole rats sperm can swim.

00:33:56.360 --> 00:34:01.200
 So they ejaculate, and then the vast majority of their sperm just like flails and flutes

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:06.080
 around, and like drowns, or doesn't make it anywhere, only 0.1% I think can swim really

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:07.880
 fast enough to get anywhere.

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:11.280
 So they're just constantly ejaculating useless, useless sperm.

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:14.720
 But they are immune to all cancer, so it's like a trade-off.

00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:16.280
 Yeah, swings and...

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:17.280
 Yeah.

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:27.200
 Up to 90% of human males sperm, as opposed to human females sperm, obviously, has two heads

00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:31.320
 or two tails, or is completely deformed in other ways.

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:38.400
 There are very few, which are, you know, the perfect guys, you see, on the posters.

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:45.640
 I just think there are unrealistic standards of beauty for sperm.

00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:51.600
 Human semen is... I'm sorry about this, but it is really amazing.

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:53.600
 Don't apologise.

00:34:53.600 --> 00:35:00.600
 I'll send you the dry cleaning bit, I'm going to call it quits.

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:06.320
 It contains proteins, ladies and gentlemen, that can forge a kind of mating plug.

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:10.960
 Like other animals have mating plugs that stop other males from impregnating females,

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:14.840
 but the proteins in human semen can do a similar kind of thing.

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:19.320
 And it also contains chemical compounds that prevent the sperm cells from becoming over

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:20.320
 enthusiastic.

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:23.520
 I'm not quite sure what that means, but...

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:30.520
 Does it sort of overshoot past the edge, end up in the kidney or something?

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:36.480
 So, there was a question on Yahoo Answers, which I never know people are joking on Yahoo Answers,

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:41.520
 but someone posted a question saying, "I ran out of shampoo and I don't have any money,

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:43.720
 have no choice and I have to go to work tomorrow."

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:46.600
 Yes, males like feces.

00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:49.440
 Can I just use sperm as my shampoo?

00:35:49.440 --> 00:36:01.440
 The next post was the next day from the same guy, "Well, no one asked me about the feces smell at least."

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:07.440
 Okay, we're going to wrap up, okay, that's it, that's all of our facts, thank you so much for coming tonight everybody.
