1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
 Hey everybody, before we get going, we have two bits of news to give you.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,280
 One very big, Stephen Frye is stepping down from QI and is going to be replaced by the

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:15,920
 incredible Sandy Toxwig, and so the final ever Stephen Frye hosted QI series starts

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,920
 tonight, October 16th at 10pm on BBC2.

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,920
 So tune in.

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,920
 Okay, news number two.

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,560
 So if you don't want to watch a really smart person tell you interesting things on a Friday

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,840
 night, then you could watch a bunch of idiots tell you equally

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,480
 interesting things on Sunday night in Brighton.

10
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,840
 We are doing our podcast, no such thing as a fish show at the Brighton Comedy Festival.

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:43,280
 It's a 5pm on Sunday evening, and also in Brighton this weekend, QI's chief gnome founder,

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,200
 creator, top dog, John Lloyd is going to be performing his show, Fresh from the Edinburgh

13
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,280
 Fringe, and here's a little taster of him.

14
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,160
 He happens to be right here with us now.

15
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,160
 Hi John.

16
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,160
 Hello.

17
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,760
 Yep, so if you enjoyed that, there's 59 more minutes of that kind of gold coming to you.

18
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,640
 Go see his show as Emperor of the Prawns.

19
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,840
 And now on with this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish.

20
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:25,400
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this

21
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,120
 week coming to you from the Lowry and Solford.

22
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:32,400
 My name is Dan Schreiber, joining me on the stage as the three regular elves, it's Andy

23
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:41,640
 Murray, Anichezinski and James Harkin.

24
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,320
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from

25
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:50,760
 the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go, starting with My Fact.

26
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:56,680
 My Fact this week is the seventh time Park Ranger Roy Sullivan was struck by lightning,

27
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:04,600
 coincided with the 22nd time he fought off a bear with a stick.

28
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,880
 So this guy is a park ranger.

29
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,000
 He was, I think he was fishing at the time, so he was just out there.

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,360
 He's been struck six times before, and then the lightning was coming.

31
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,000
 He just thought I'll just stay here, probably nothing bad will happen.

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,520
 God struck by lightning, was running back to his car, and suddenly a bear comes out

33
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,520
 of nowhere.

34
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,920
 Jesus Christ, has to fight off a bear and then went back home.

35
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:37,960
 His diary must have been amazing, bear, bear, lightning, lightning and bear.

36
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,200
 But he, as I said, he's been struck seven times.

37
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,120
 He was almost struck eight times, but the eighth time when he should have been struck, it

38
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,120
 hit his wife instead.

39
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,120
 It sounds awful.

40
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,560
 It sounds terrible because obviously he was interviewed because he was very, he became

41
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,560
 well known for this, and he said, naturally, people avoid me.

42
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,440
 I was walking with the chief ranger one day, and lightning struck way off, and he said,

43
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,560
 "I'll see you later, Roy."

44
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,320
 Then he said, "There's a restaurant on Loft Mountain that even it's just overcast, they

45
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,920
 won't let me in."

46
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,000
 It sounds awful.

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,680
 It sounds terrible because at time number four, this is August 1973, I think he died

48
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,840
 in the early 80s, possibly, but in August 1973, he got in his car and he accelerated because

49
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,320
 there was a cloud forming, and he was very nervous about storm clouds by this point.

50
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:39,720
 And he out ran it, stopped the car, got out of it to watch the storm hit by lightning again.

51
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,720
 They have a full list of all the times that he was...

52
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,720
 The first time he lost his big toenail.

53
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,720
 Right.

54
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,720
 To lightning.

55
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,720
 Oh, it's a big toenail.

56
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,720
 Yeah, a big toenail.

57
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,640
 At the time, a bolt came out of a small low-lying cloud, hit him on the head through his hat,

58
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,880
 set his hair on fire again, again.

59
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,880
 Not in ten feet out of his car, and not his left shoe off.

60
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:07,360
 Do you know why shoes come off when you get hit by lightning?

61
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,480
 This is because you watch cartoons.

62
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:16,240
 So for example, when it hits a tree, lightning, it will sometimes explode a tree if the moisture

63
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:20,720
 is in the middle of the tree, because it takes the path of least resistance.

64
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,400
 People obviously, there's moisture everywhere and we're 70% liquid, so it often dissipates

65
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,040
 all over your skin.

66
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,720
 But when it does that, all the sweat and the moisture on you boil into steam immediately

67
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,040
 and sometimes so much steam is produced that your shoes will be blown off.

68
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,040
 That's what causes it.

69
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,000
 So he got struck seven times.

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Yeah.

71
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,520
 I found somebody who's been struck even more.

72
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,520
 Really?

73
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,400
 There's a guy called Melvin Roberts from South Carolina, and he at least claims to have

74
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,600
 been struck ten times.

75
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,320
 He was in the news in 2011 for being hit six times, and his wife says that he's been struck

76
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,080
 another four times since.

77
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,080
 By lightning, definitely.

78
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,680
 She's not just by thinking really about it.

79
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,240
 I think I found a group of people who've been struck by lightning even more than that.

80
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,240
 Well, really?

81
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,240
 Yeah.

82
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,240
 So I was reading the 14 times.

83
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,080
 It's an amazing magazine, and in it, they had a small story where someone had written

84
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:18,240
 in to contest the fact that Roy Sullivan was the most struck person of all time, and what

85
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,960
 they said was that in 1995, a group of explorers who were up on a mountain mountaineer's got

86
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:29,760
 struck twenty times in sixteen hours, a group of five, and they were in their tent, and they

87
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:34,760
 all describe the moment that they were struck, and they were just in there getting struck

88
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:39,280
 over and over again, seventeen times, and we got to get out of there, out of here.

89
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,720
 There's a rescue shelter down the mountain, so he started absailing, and while they were

90
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,440
 doing that, they were struck three more times on the absailed down.

91
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,440
 Oh, my God.

92
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,240
 To be fair, I do think you have to define that by five, though, at which point you haven't

93
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,240
 been record anymore.

94
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,240
 Very good point.

95
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,240
 Yeah.

96
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,240
 It's all about the mass.

97
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,480
 Sometimes goes from one person to another, as well.

98
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,480
 No.

99
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:02,880
 Or it can hit, for example, it can rebound off a tree and into a horse or whatever.

100
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,880
 Yeah.

101
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,820
 I mean, then it's less likely to kill you, because at least some of the force has been

102
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,820
 dissipated.

103
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:08,820
 Yeah.

104
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:13,040
 Men account for 85% of lightning strikes, isn't that weird?

105
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,460
 And the National Weather Service in the US speculated that this might be because men tend

106
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:22,640
 to be unaware of all the dangers associated with lightning, more likely to be invulnerable

107
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:28,740
 situations, unwilling to be inconvenienced by the threat of lightning, and don't react

108
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:33,940
 quickly to the lightning threat, or any combination of these explanations.

109
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:37,620
 So there's stupid, ignorant, big-headed, and they have very slow reactions.

110
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,980
 No, she was just my interpretation, but I think that's the long and short of it.

111
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:47,260
 A man in Croatia has admitted that he has not gone outside after hearing thunder since

112
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:52,940
 lightning struck his penis in 2007.

113
00:06:52,940 --> 00:07:00,860
 Zoran Jurkovich, it's online, honestly.

114
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:06,420
 Zoran Jurkovich said, "My friends used to tease me, and I used to tease them back, saying

115
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:13,420
 my penis has extraordinary ability now, but it doesn't."

116
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:23,180
 It's hard to tease them back when you've just got a sort of child stumped.

117
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:26,540
 So I think there might be something about Croatia, God hates it or something, so there's

118
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:32,540
 a Croatian woman who has been left recently with a severely burned anus after a lightning

119
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:37,420
 strike, ended her mouth while she was cleaning her teeth and drinking water from the tap,

120
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:42,220
 came through the tap, ended her mouth, and then left through the anus so it could earth

121
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,260
 through the ground.

122
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:50,140
 Apparently, so the report said she was wearing rubber-sold shoes, so once the lightning had entered

123
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:53,780
 through her mouth when she was drinking water from the tap, it took the easiest route and

124
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,940
 came out of her rectum to reach her rubber-sold shoes.

125
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:04,780
 You know, speaking of lightning coming out the bum, there actually is a fabled worm called

126
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:11,700
 the Mongolian death worm, which is in Mongolia, and is it done?

127
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,700
 Is it?

128
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:17,900
 It's a massive worm, and all accounts of it say that it can shoot acid from its eyes and

129
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,700
 lightning bolts from its anus.

130
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,700
 Accounts?

131
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:25,140
 I don't think they deserve the name "accounts."

132
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:28,500
 One really knows why lightning happens today.

133
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:33,220
 We find, when you're at school, they tell you it's because clouds are rubbing together

134
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:37,580
 or whatever, and it kind of is that a little bit, but it's like ice going up in their clouds

135
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,820
 and water coming down or the other way around, and they rub against each other, and it causes

136
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,640
 like static electricity like you would have with a balloon.

137
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,260
 But no one really knows why it starts, and it's like a chain reaction that starts, and

138
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:51,700
 one theory you'll like this done, apparently there's a latest theory coming from Russia

139
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:56,620
 that it's cosmic rays, which come from outside the solar system and hit the earth, and that's

140
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,100
 what starts the lightning in the first place.

141
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,100
 Wow.

142
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,740
 And no one knows what causes cosmic rays, really.

143
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,060
 I mean, it could be supernovas or quasars or...

144
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:07,860
 The Mongolian death worm.

145
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,940
 We can't rule it out.

146
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,660
 Yeah, amazing.

147
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:17,260
 You know, America has two annual conferences for lightning strikes survivors.

148
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,260
 Oh, really?

149
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,260
 Yeah.

150
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,220
 It's actually about 80% of people struck by lightning actually survive...

151
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,220
 Yes, right.

152
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,220
 Yes, it is.

153
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,180
 80% to 90% live, but it's not plain sailing after that.

154
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:30,980
 It's not as though you have burns and then you recover, it can scramble your memory, and

155
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:34,900
 there are all these long-term effects that we don't know about, and it just gets right

156
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:39,100
 into your cells, and there aren't enough cases that are studied in the medical literature

157
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,340
 to have a proper body of science, so it's a lot of guesswork, and yeah, there just isn't

158
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:46,260
 the money to try and work out what exactly has happened.

159
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,260
 Okay.

160
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,180
 We're going to have to move on to our next fact in a minute.

161
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,380
 Is there anything else you guys want to add?

162
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:57,260
 Um, another thing that we can't explain is the lightning that happens at the beacon of

163
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:01,180
 Mara Cabo, which is the most incredible place on the planet.

164
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,260
 So this is a place in Venezuela.

165
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:10,500
 It's the Catatumbo River, I think in Venezuela, and it's one tiny spot where for 280 times

166
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:16,060
 an hour, for 10 hours a night, for 160 nights a year, lightning strikes this exact same

167
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,580
 spot, and nobody knows why.

168
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:24,420
 I reckon it could be Roy Sullivan doing some fishing, but isn't that weird, and it was mentioned

169
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:30,980
 first in a poem about Francis Drake in 1597, and Fisherman used it on this lake in Venezuela

170
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:35,020
 to light their way, so if they're going fishing, they just use this class and lightning storm

171
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,940
 to say, okay, well, there's the storm, yes, we go towards that, because that's where we'll

172
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:38,940
 get the best light.

173
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:39,940
 Slash die.

174
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:43,140
 Um, yeah, no one knows what happens.

175
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,140
 Wow.

176
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,140
 That's amazing.

177
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:49,180
 You read about that, and I think it replenishes the ozone layer, doesn't it?

178
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,980
 The biggest source of ozone on Earth, the biggest single source of ozone on Earth, so it's

179
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:53,980
 a good thing.

180
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:54,980
 Yeah, it's a good thing.

181
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:55,980
 That's so cool.

182
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,860
 Okay, we're going to move on to fact number two, and that is James Harkin.

183
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:06,380
 Okay, my fact this week is that this year, America's Hero Dog of the Year award was won

184
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,860
 by a cat.

185
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,860
 (Laughter)

186
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:12,860
 It can't have been a good night to be a dog.

187
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:19,300
 Yeah, so this is Tara the Cat, and I reckon some people will know it, or will at least know

188
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,660
 the cat itself because it's been a bit of an internet sensation.

189
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,940
 There was a young child being mulled by a dog next to a car.

190
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:30,300
 You might have seen the video on YouTube, and then this cat runs on and kind of scares the

191
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:35,060
 dog away, and then runs off again, and she became such a hero that she is now an honorary

192
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,060
 dog.

193
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,060
 Wow.

194
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:44,660
 What a way to reward her to invite her to a ceremony full of dogs, who now it was soft

195
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,060
 at a cat's one.

196
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,060
 It is amazing.

197
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,380
 She just full on runs into the dog.

198
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,380
 She just smashes her head.

199
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,380
 Have you guys seen that video?

200
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,380
 You must have done it right.

201
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,380
 Yeah, it's good.

202
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,380
 It's good to watch.

203
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:58,780
 Yeah, she got a few other awards, actually.

204
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:02,820
 She was invited by the local baseball team, the Bakersfield Blaze, because this was in

205
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,060
 Bakersfield in California.

206
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:10,500
 They invited her to throw the first pitch, not a way.

207
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,780
 Yeah, and a baseball game.

208
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:12,780
 How did she do?

209
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:16,740
 Well, it said on the news report that she was assisted by her family.

210
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:22,460
 I watched it, and the family do a lot of assisting.

211
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:27,260
 It goes wrong about five times, and then basically a guy holding a cat throws a ball.

212
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,260
 That's basically it.

213
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:33,340
 But this video is the first YouTube video in history to reach 20 million views in five

214
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,340
 days.

215
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:37,580
 And the cat became a hero, and the dog was put down.

216
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,580
 Wasn't it?

217
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,580
 No way.

218
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,580
 Did you just bite it?

219
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,380
 It had been the child really badly on the leg.

220
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,380
 Yeah, OK, yeah.

221
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,100
 Sorry.

222
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,100
 On the dog side.

223
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,100
 No, I'm not.

224
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,660
 Cats have a long and noble history of impersonating dogs, though, don't they?

225
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:55,420
 Because they bark, like, can bark like dogs.

226
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:58,580
 Like, if you have cats and dogs they've been together, then cats will learn to impersonate

227
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,580
 dogs.

228
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,580
 OK, hang on.

229
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,580
 No, I've never--

230
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,580
 Yeah.

231
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:05,420
 I'm the Mongolian death one guy.

232
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:08,100
 If you basically look at a time into YouTube, cats bark like dogs.

233
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:13,300
 Are you sure that a cat can bark like a dog, and not that a dog can throw its voice?

234
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:17,740
 Dogs are actually amazing ventriloquists, and we've not realized.

235
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:21,100
 But there is a really good video on YouTube of a cat owner.

236
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,140
 I mean, I can't believe we're discussing YouTube memes, but let's do it.

237
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:29,380
 A cat owner who sneaks up behind her cat, filming her cat, sitting on a window ledge,

238
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,940
 looking outside at a dog, which obviously lives with the family.

239
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,260
 They all live for next door, so it's lived around it, and barking.

240
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:37,140
 And it's honestly going, the cat's going, "Ruff, ruff, ruff."

241
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,660
 And it keeps doing this, loads.

242
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:42,300
 And then the person who's holding the camera sort of clears her throat, and the cat hears,

243
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,660
 and looks around and starts to be, "Mew!"

244
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:47,900
 [LAUGHTER]

245
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:52,100
 And the science came up with some bullshit expression, like, "Oh, she turned her vocal chords,

246
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,540
 she turned around, which changed the tenor of her voice."

247
00:13:54,540 --> 00:14:00,020
 But it's quite clearly the cat going, "Woop see, I've been caught right in the act of impersonating

248
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,020
 a dog."

249
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,020
 [LAUGHTER]

250
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:06,660
 So, just on heroic dogs, I have a couple of different kinds of heroic dogs that we all know

251
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,660
 about.

252
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,820
 So, bomb detecting dogs, I mean, how about guide dogs.

253
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,420
 There is only one, I believe, there's great piece in the Guardian about this.

254
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:17,300
 There is only one airborne nut allergy dog in the UK.

255
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,300
 [LAUGHTER]

256
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,140
 Sorry, the dog was airborne on the nut.

257
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:23,140
 [LAUGHTER]

258
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,140
 My fault, should have clarified.

259
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,980
 So, there's a woman also called Tara, actually.

260
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,900
 Tara Bedford, she has an incredibly bad nut allergy, so bad that even the smell of

261
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,940
 nuts can trigger a reaction.

262
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,660
 She says, "Any rustle on a train or a bus, and it's, what are they opening?

263
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,660
 Should I move?"

264
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:41,700
 She can't go to the cinema, she can't go to a catch, she can't go in a plane because someone

265
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,740
 opens a pack of the peanuts and she's dead, she's in a plane.

266
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:50,900
 She had to go to any 40 times in four years, but the story has a happy ending because there

267
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:58,660
 was a labrador who had failed a guide dog test for overuse of the nose, put them together,

268
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:03,780
 and now the dog forcefully pushes her whenever the dog smells nuts, a peanut or a nut she's

269
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,780
 allergic to.

270
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,780
 So it's a very good ending.

271
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,780
 Seeing nose dog.

272
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,780
 Seeing nose dog, yeah.

273
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,780
 Wow, that's so cool.

274
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,780
 Wow.

275
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,780
 And he flies as well.

276
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,780
 And he's...

277
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,780
 [LAUGHTER]

278
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,780
 Russian.

279
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,780
 Sorry.

280
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,780
 Russia employs sniffer cats.

281
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,780
 Really?

282
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:21,780
 Really?

283
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:27,380
 Yeah, there's some sniffer cats in Russia, and they're looking for kind of Russian Mafia

284
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:34,300
 that might be smuggling fish for the caviar down in the south of Russia.

285
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,100
 And the most famous one, the first one was called the Rusek.

286
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,660
 And Rusek died when he was hit by a criminal's car quite recently.

287
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:44,660
 And the locals thought that it might be a contract killing because the week before, another

288
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:48,820
 cat called Barsik was killed after he was poisoned by a mouse.

289
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,820
 What?

290
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,820
 Sorry, with a mouse.

291
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,820
 [LAUGHTER]

292
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:58,820
 Yeah.

293
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:03,580
 I was looking into sort of the latest in cat news.

294
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:06,740
 And I headed to a place I discovered a few podcasts ago.

295
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:11,180
 I headed to Pussington Post.

296
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,540
 Just a few recent headlines.

297
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,260
 Cat ignores frogs sitting on his paw.

298
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,260
 That's...

299
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:21,380
 That was September 17th, if you want to look that one up.

300
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:27,020
 If you're into cat news, which you obviously are, there's this guy who is constantly updating

301
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,340
 us on cat news.

302
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:34,500
 He runs a Twitter feed called NBA Catwatch, and the entire Twitter feed is devoted to finding

303
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,420
 out what cats are owned by basketball players.

304
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,180
 And he's been going for quite a while now.

305
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:44,940
 So he said, it's sort of a typical dumb Twitter joke, but the more he thought about it, something

306
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,940
 caught in my brain.

307
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:50,500
 I'd be watching a basketball game, and I'd start to think about who does owner cat

308
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,940
 on this team.

309
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:57,300
 He said, I'm aware that it's ridiculous trying to find NBA players cats on social media.

310
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,020
 However, it's my niche, and I got there first.

311
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,020
 [LAUGHTER]

312
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:07,660
 And yet, no one has ever got the second out there.

313
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:16,100
 I found a really exciting Guinness Book World Record, which is for world-mousing champion.

314
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,380
 And the winner of this, the current champion of this award.

315
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,380
 It's a dog.

316
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,380
 It's a dog.

317
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:24,900
 It's a cat, but it's amazing that this is an actual record that's being held.

318
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:32,700
 So it's a cat called Towsr, and Towsr was stationed at Distillery in Scotland, where Grouse

319
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,500
 Whiskey is made.

320
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:39,700
 And during her reign, she killed 28,899 mice.

321
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,700
 No way.

322
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,300
 And so that's a Guinness World Record.

323
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,300
 No way.

324
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,300
 And then she died.

325
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,940
 So she got taken over by another cat called Amber, who's been there for 20 years now, and

326
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:51,580
 who they've said was not known to have caught a single mouse.

327
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:54,780
 They've all been caught already.

328
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,300
 She's just got there at a first angle.

329
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:59,700
 Well, there's not much to do here, isn't it?

330
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,060
 Can I tell you about a couple of more little dog things?

331
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:02,900
 Yes, please.

332
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:08,140
 So there's another kind of dog, which is a Corpse Detection Dog.

333
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:11,820
 So please use them to find bodies, things like this.

334
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:15,700
 And they have to be trained, but you can't train them obviously on real cases, because

335
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,180
 they're very few of those.

336
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:23,060
 So they're trained by wrapping up pigs bodies in shower curtains.

337
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,060
 And there's a man who runs a search company, his name is Mick Swindles, and he says he

338
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:30,100
 always puts clothes on the pigs, too, for added realism.

339
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,140
 Insert your own David Cameron joke here.

340
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,140
 Oh, God.

341
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:41,900
 Well, this is the thing.

342
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:45,740
 He said of them, because he puts clothes on them, and he said, people say, why do you always

343
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,420
 put them in a skirt?

344
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,820
 Have you ever tried putting trousers on a pig?

345
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:57,020
 So presumably these cat's are just now really good at detecting clothes, pigs, dogs are

346
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:02,020
 really good at detecting clothes, pigs, and not that good at detecting human causes.

347
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,980
 We're very similar to pigs in many ways.

348
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,980
 Speak yourself.

349
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:06,980
 OK.

350
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,740
 We're going to have to move on in a sec.

351
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,740
 Can I say one thing?

352
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:14,980
 This original fact was in Bakersfield in California, and so I found another story from

353
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,980
 Bakersfield.

354
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:16,980
 It's just a quick one.

355
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:22,780
 It's a guy called Mr. Slivers, and he was arrested, and they interviewed him afterwards.

356
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:27,740
 And this way he said, he said, I was just bored, and I decided I wanted to be a cat burglar.

357
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:32,220
 So I kicked in the window and tried to steal the lion, but it was too heavy, so I stole the

358
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,220
 cat.

359
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:37,900
 And he wanted to be a cat burglar, and thought that a cat burglar is something that steals

360
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,900
 cats.

361
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:43,900
 I'm more interested in the home that owns both the lion and the cat.

362
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,900
 So it was a museum.

363
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,900
 It was a museum.

364
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,900
 Oh.

365
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:47,900
 Sorry.

366
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,900
 Right.

367
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,900
 OK.

368
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,900
 Got it.

369
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:55,340
 Otherwise, I don't think you'd be saying the lion is too heavy.

370
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,740
 Weight is the least of your problems.

371
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:03,340
 That lion was way too bitey on my face.

372
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,740
 OK.

373
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:08,420
 It's time for fact number three, and that is Chazinsky.

374
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,420
 Yeah.

375
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:16,180
 Fact is that the earliest known penalty for illegal parking was to be impaled on a stake.

376
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,180
 Yeah.

377
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:22,780
 It's firm, it's firm, but it's fair.

378
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:29,060
 And if you appeal, it's a smaller stake.

379
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:33,020
 So this was actually in 700 BC.

380
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:37,060
 This is the earliest parking restriction I can find, so it's in Nineveh, which is the

381
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,780
 Assyrian capital.

382
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:42,180
 And the parking restriction was put in place by King Sinacarib.

383
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:47,140
 And we have a stone tablet where he's laid out the restriction, and it says, Royal Road

384
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:54,140
 let no man decrease it, or let no man lessen it, this Royal Road, and on pain of being impaled

385
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,140
 on a stake.

386
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,620
 And you got impaled on a stake if you did park on the Royal Road in your chariot, obviously

387
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,420
 not your motor car.

388
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:04,060
 And impaled on a stake and then planted in your own garden so that people who were coming

389
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:09,420
 to visit you could go, oh, I guess he's not available for tea.

390
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,060
 Wow, planted in your own garden.

391
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:14,260
 Would you have a little label sticking out like you get on those plants?

392
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,260
 Yeah.

393
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,660
 Yeah, with the species.

394
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,260
 This is a Norman.

395
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:24,100
 Yeah, Sinacarib, he was, he's most famous for moving his capital city to Nineveh, like

396
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:28,700
 you say, and had like a really amazing capital city then he had like gardens.

397
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:32,100
 They think it might be in the Hanging Gardens, if anyone was there.

398
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,580
 And yeah, he was just an extremely opulent man.

399
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:40,140
 Apparently he had a piece of Noah's Ark which he worshipped as a god, and he once wrote

400
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:45,940
 about his enemies, their testicles I cut off, and tore out their privates like the seeds

401
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,540
 of cucumbers.

402
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,940
 He was good with a simile, actually.

403
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:56,540
 Sounds like he was very bad at making sandwiches.

404
00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:07,740
 You selectively shave the outside of a cucumber, then you slot it at home in the sandwich.

405
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:12,580
 He actually, so he was not a humble man because he did create these incredible gardens.

406
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:16,340
 I mean, he's, I think people should know more about Sinacarib and very little is written

407
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,340
 about him.

408
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:21,140
 But a lot of historians now think that the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, as you say, were

409
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:25,780
 his gardens, and he irrigated the mountains all around, so he built this incredible canal

410
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:31,100
 that stretched 50 kilometers up into the mountains, and which irrigated his whole amazing new city.

411
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:35,540
 But he was pretty cocky about it, so even on the signposts where he said you'll be impaled

412
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:39,380
 on a steak or cucumber or whatever if you part here.

413
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:43,180
 Then the little signposts then went on to list his achievements.

414
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:48,820
 Explaining Sinacarib is a king of the world, favorite of the gods, holder of invincible weapons

415
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,460
 and architect of urban design.

416
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,940
 So I think that's quite a piece of it.

417
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:57,420
 On those signs you put up here, here's what I've achieved, guys.

418
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,420
 Wow.

419
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,420
 Yeah.

420
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,420
 That's amazing.

421
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:03,540
 Do you know, in Britain, the first ever parking ticket that was given?

422
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,540
 No.

423
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,900
 Okay, so it was in September 1960.

424
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,220
 They set this up.

425
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,220
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

426
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:12,500
 It was quite like where it was like an established proper where parking attendance went

427
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,060
 out.

428
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:19,660
 And the first ever ticket was given to a Dr. Thomas Craton who was answering an emergency

429
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:23,420
 call to help a heart attack victim at a West End Hotel.

430
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,420
 So he raced there.

431
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,420
 He got out.

432
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,620
 When he came back, he had a ticket.

433
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:31,060
 And there was so much public outcry that they said, okay, you haven't got a ticket.

434
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,300
 That was the first ticket.

435
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:39,620
 Could you imagine the, how was your first day, the clocked up pretty bad.

436
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:43,500
 But the first parking ticket in America was also had to be overturned.

437
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,500
 Oh, really?

438
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,020
 Maybe parking tickets are just a failed enterprise.

439
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,060
 Yeah, this was a reverend, actually.

440
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:53,340
 The reverend CH North of the third Penta Costal Honest Church.

441
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,740
 And it was a newly installed parking meter, the country's first parking meter.

442
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:01,180
 And he just ran into a shop to get change and by the time he'd come out, he got a ticket.

443
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,900
 And he complained to the courts and had it overturned.

444
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,900
 Wow.

445
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:08,260
 It would be pretty hard to get it overturned in the old days when you're being impaled

446
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,260
 on a stage.

447
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:14,140
 I've got a story about parking tickets.

448
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,980
 So begins so many of them exactly go.

449
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:22,100
 Okay, so this is from January this year, and it was from the BBC News website.

450
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:27,540
 A traffic warden is being investigated after a parking ticket was placed on a wheelie bin.

451
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:32,380
 The warden was accused of bizarre behaviour.

452
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:36,620
 So one witness said this, it appeared the warden slapped the plastic ticket envelope on

453
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:40,500
 the bin in a moment of high jinks after a member of the public pointed out it was on double

454
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,500
 yellow lines.

455
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,500
 So it's a joke.

456
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,500
 It's just a silly joke, yeah.

457
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,580
 But then the response, this is in Camarthen.

458
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:51,260
 The Marvinshire Council Traffic and Safety Manager, John McEvoy, said, although this was

459
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:54,940
 meant as a humorous incident, we take this kind of thing very seriously and have launched

460
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:58,580
 a formal investigation into the conduct of the officer.

461
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:05,180
 Although this is meant as a humorous incident, we are still the arseholes, you think we are?

462
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:10,940
 I have some stuff on weird laws and slightly strange punishments, if that's okay.

463
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:15,180
 The hit heights, apparently, they had a rule where anyone found guilty of committing

464
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,820
 a sex act with a dog or pig would be killed.

465
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:23,500
 And so your own David Carrenzo gear?

466
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:27,100
 But if it was with a horse or a mule, the only punishment that they could give out was

467
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:31,140
 that you were no longer allowed to be in the presence of the king.

468
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,140
 Wow.

469
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,140
 That's good.

470
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,140
 Nice, look.

471
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:41,220
 And if the king, sorry, if the king, if the pig mounted the human, then no one would be

472
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,220
 punished at all.

473
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,220
 It had to be the human who was sitting there.

474
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,300
 Well, how would the king - is that his opening question to everyone?

475
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,300
 You fucked a horse.

476
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,700
 I think it's that.

477
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:53,980
 Because you could just be in an audience of the king and it doesn't get to him that you

478
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:54,980
 did it.

479
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:55,980
 That's a good point.

480
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:56,980
 Yeah, I don't know.

481
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:59,620
 He was very close with the horse community.

482
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,980
 They reported all these things.

483
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:01,980
 Poopington Post.

484
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,140
 Oh, that was a good one.

485
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:08,140
 That's really good.

486
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:13,380
 It's good, but it has.

487
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:17,460
 So do you know about the guy who invented the double yellow lines?

488
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,460
 No.

489
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:24,780
 This is a guy called George Bamber and this was in the late 19th century, so the 1880s.

490
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:29,380
 And he based the double yellow line, he was a farmer and he based the design on the markings

491
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,100
 he put on his sheep.

492
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,300
 So he used to strike his sheep with double yellow lines.

493
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:37,300
 And he noticed that no one ever walked on his sheep and parked on them.

494
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,100
 I thought this is something.

495
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:44,060
 Actually, he wanted to keep the entrance to his farm clear on market day so people would

496
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,420
 come in and buy his produce.

497
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,460
 So he thought, what design could I use?

498
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:50,300
 Oh, there's yellow lines from the sheep and he drew them out.

499
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:53,620
 And it really caught on in his village to the mayor of his town, started using these

500
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:56,980
 double yellow lines to stop people parking in undesirable places.

501
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:01,580
 But he received a 10% commission for a number of years on, like whenever the double yellow

502
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:05,020
 lines were used that he'd taken from the sheep, he got a commission on them.

503
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,020
 That's amazing.

504
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,020
 Isn't that cool?

505
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,020
 That's really cool.

506
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:10,460
 I think because I would have thought it was based on the single yellow line, but you're

507
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,460
 saying that was invented first.

508
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,460
 No.

509
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,460
 Double yellow line came first.

510
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,460
 That is amazing.

511
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,460
 Yeah.

512
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,460
 Yeah.

513
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,460
 It's like hearing that Rocky 2 was made before Rocky.

514
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,460
 And Rocky 2 was so good.

515
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:24,980
 I thought we should do all one.

516
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:29,340
 Oh, we're going to have to move on to our dex facts.

517
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,340
 You guys got any more?

518
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,340
 All right.

519
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,340
 Let's do it.

520
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:36,820
 It's time for our final fact of the evening and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

521
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:43,180
 My fact is that female corn earworm moths go invisible after sex.

522
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:46,620
 So this needs a bit of explaining.

523
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:53,660
 Basically, when, so corn earworm moths are a kind of moth, and when males mate with females,

524
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:59,140
 they have a protein in their semen, which makes the female invisible to other males.

525
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:04,580
 So it gets into the female's body and it inhibits all pheromone production immediately.

526
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:08,180
 And the males only can tell when females are run by smell.

527
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,660
 They don't have very good vision at all.

528
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,460
 They can't really see other females.

529
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:16,980
 So it's a self-preservation thing by the male who's done the mating.

530
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,580
 He thinks, well, I want this female off the market.

531
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:22,820
 So he just makes the female invisible to other males.

532
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:27,860
 Why didn't he just paint double yellow lines on that?

533
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:31,900
 So this is from a book called Nature's Nether Regions.

534
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:36,980
 I called Menno Shelte Huisen, I hope I'm pronouncing his name right.

535
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:39,220
 And I just find that incredible.

536
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,220
 That's amazing.

537
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,220
 Totally insane.

538
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,220
 Yeah.

539
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:46,180
 So basically, there are all kinds of animals which do incredible, strange things through the

540
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,940
 medium of sex.

541
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:51,380
 So banana flies are a kind of fly.

542
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,380
 And male banana flies.

543
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,140
 Not kind of banana.

544
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:58,780
 Good.

545
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:02,940
 So when male banana flies have sex with female banana flies, they deposit a seamen in

546
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:03,940
 the female.

547
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:09,140
 And that contains a chemical which makes the female go completely off all other males.

548
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:12,900
 So they start kicking away other males and then they give off a scent to make themselves

549
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,900
 unattractive.

550
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,900
 And it lasts for a week.

551
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,940
 It's not actually that long, is it?

552
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,940
 It is if you're a banana fly, I think.

553
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,540
 Completely kills their sex life.

554
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:24,180
 I mean, how much action are these females getting?

555
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:27,140
 Well, some in sex do all the mating on a single day.

556
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,140
 Yeah, okay.

557
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,140
 Yeah, yeah.

558
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,140
 No, sorry.

559
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:36,460
 I read that female beetles, they quench their thirst through sex.

560
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:41,500
 And it's because of the seamen and the fluids in the seamen because they get very dehydrated.

561
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:45,180
 And so when they have sex, it's actually just like having a drink for them.

562
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:49,620
 That's the reason we all do it, don't we?

563
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:53,820
 Sometimes the tap is too far away.

564
00:29:53,820 --> 00:30:04,460
 So some in sex do all the mating.

565
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:10,340
 So bees and ants do all the mating for a lifetime in a single day when the queen does all her

566
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,340
 mating.

567
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:19,220
 And the males sort of try and fight each other with seamen to do rivalry, basically.

568
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:23,800
 And some queens, if they've mated with a male and they like that male, they can secrete

569
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:29,780
 a fluid to protect that male's seamen from the rival sperm, basically.

570
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:34,440
 And the scientist who found this out is called Boris Bear, from the University of Western

571
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,440
 Australia.

572
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,000
 And he was asked whether this might happen in humans, whether human women could do such

573
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 a thing.

574
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 And he said that he doubted it.

575
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 And he said, to my knowledge, women do not copulate with 90 mates in half an hour.

576
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,200
 In his limited experience.

577
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:57,840
 We are learning a lot about you to learn how to do this.

578
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:03,960
 So the New Zealand giraffe weevil, which it's a weevil, not a giraffe.

579
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:07,560
 The way that they mate is like you get two weevils and they fight against each other and usually

580
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,360
 the biggest weevil wins.

581
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,720
 But there are little weevils that kind of sneak around.

582
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:16,080
 And when there's two males fighting over a female, that weevil goes in and then steals

583
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,800
 the female while she's like kind of watching the fight.

584
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,880
 And the female actually ends up having sex with the smallest weevil.

585
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,880
 Wow.

586
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:33,760
 She actually goes for lesser of two weevils.

587
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:38,960
 I've never seen you look more disappointed in me than I.

588
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,960
 That was incredible.

589
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:44,280
 Mass suicide was committed tonight.

590
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:48,800
 Here's a really, really weird thing, an interesting thing about flies, baby flies.

591
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:55,920
 Baby flies can get characteristics from males who have had sex with their mother, but not

592
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,920
 their father.

593
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:02,640
 So a male who's had sex with the mother much, much earlier can still give characteristics

594
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,640
 to the fly.

595
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,640
 Wow.

596
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,640
 Wow.

597
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,640
 Well, we don't know.

598
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,640
 It's really new research.

599
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,360
 But that is unbelievably interesting.

600
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,520
 But what's a characteristic for them?

601
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:15,720
 So say, for instance, the female fly had sex with a really big fly.

602
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,720
 Yeah.

603
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,400
 And then nothing came from it.

604
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:22,520
 And then the father, well, and you know, being a little scrawny fly, then the baby might have

605
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:27,600
 the bigness of the original guy who she had sex with, even though it's not his actually

606
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,600
 father.

607
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,600
 Oh, wow.

608
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,600
 This sounds very suspect.

609
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,600
 Are we sure this isn't just a lot of women cheating on their husbands?

610
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,600
 No.

611
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,800
 No, it's new research.

612
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,800
 It's why this baby's ginger.

613
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,800
 That research.

614
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:48,520
 Yeah, it's called telegony.

615
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:52,280
 And it used to be believed by humans, by people.

616
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:57,000
 In ancient Greek time, people thought that your children would have things from whoever

617
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,480
 you had sex with, whether it was the father or not.

618
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,480
 Wow.

619
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,480
 And it was thought for a long, long time.

620
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,120
 And then it was shown to be not true in humans, but they've recently found that it might

621
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,120
 be true.

622
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,120
 Probably is true in flies.

623
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,120
 Wow.

624
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,120
 That's so cool.

625
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:12,000
 It was a wrong belief, and it was just completely wrong for no reason, and then it turned out we

626
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 were right all along.

627
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,400
 It's very satisfying.

628
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,640
 Norwegian rats sperm.

629
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,440
 They can join forces with each other and become a super sperm.

630
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:26,240
 They have little hook-shaped heads and hundreds of them just hook onto each other and say, guys,

631
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,560
 we can do this together.

632
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,560
 And then they swim faster as a single.

633
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,560
 What?

634
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,560
 It's like the power rangers.

635
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,560
 You remember when they combine forces?

636
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,560
 Oh, yeah.

637
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:39,400
 To make a larger power ranger. It's much like that. And that's why Andy never did any more

638
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,400
 babysitting.

639
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,640
 Naked mole rats, but have you guys all seen naked mole rats?

640
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:49,800
 Because I mean, they're just so extraordinary, and basically every single way.

641
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:56,360
 But their sperm are also bizarre, so only 7% of naked mole rats sperm can swim.

642
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:01,200
 So they ejaculate, and then the vast majority of their sperm just like flails and flutes

643
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,080
 around, and like drowns, or doesn't make it anywhere, only 0.1% I think can swim really

644
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,880
 fast enough to get anywhere.

645
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:11,280
 So they're just constantly ejaculating useless, useless sperm.

646
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,720
 But they are immune to all cancer, so it's like a trade-off.

647
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,280
 Yeah, swings and...

648
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,280
 Yeah.

649
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:27,200
 Up to 90% of human males sperm, as opposed to human females sperm, obviously, has two heads

650
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,320
 or two tails, or is completely deformed in other ways.

651
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:38,400
 There are very few, which are, you know, the perfect guys, you see, on the posters.

652
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:45,640
 I just think there are unrealistic standards of beauty for sperm.

653
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:51,600
 Human semen is... I'm sorry about this, but it is really amazing.

654
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,600
 Don't apologise.

655
00:34:53,600 --> 00:35:00,600
 I'll send you the dry cleaning bit, I'm going to call it quits.

656
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:06,320
 It contains proteins, ladies and gentlemen, that can forge a kind of mating plug.

657
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,960
 Like other animals have mating plugs that stop other males from impregnating females,

658
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,840
 but the proteins in human semen can do a similar kind of thing.

659
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:19,320
 And it also contains chemical compounds that prevent the sperm cells from becoming over

660
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,320
 enthusiastic.

661
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,520
 I'm not quite sure what that means, but...

662
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:30,520
 Does it sort of overshoot past the edge, end up in the kidney or something?

663
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:36,480
 So, there was a question on Yahoo Answers, which I never know people are joking on Yahoo Answers,

664
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:41,520
 but someone posted a question saying, "I ran out of shampoo and I don't have any money,

665
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,720
 have no choice and I have to go to work tomorrow."

666
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,600
 Yes, males like feces.

667
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,440
 Can I just use sperm as my shampoo?

668
00:35:49,440 --> 00:36:01,440
 The next post was the next day from the same guy, "Well, no one asked me about the feces smell at least."

669
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:07,440
