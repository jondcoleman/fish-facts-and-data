00:00:07,00:00:15,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"" a weekly podcast"
00:00:15,00:00:17,coming to you from the QI offices.
00:00:17,00:00:22,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with Alex Bell, Andy Murray, and Anna Chazinski."
00:00:22,00:00:25,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from"
00:00:25,00:00:29,"the last seven days and in an particular order, here we go."
00:00:29,00:00:32,"Starting with you, Andy Murray."
00:00:32,00:00:37,"My fact is that in Peru, depictions of the last supper show Jesus and His disciples eating"
00:00:37,00:00:38,a guinea pig.
00:00:38,00:00:42,"That's what they do, that's what it's there."
00:00:42,00:00:47,"This is, well there's one particular famous painting by a guy called Marcos Zapata, who"
00:00:47,00:00:54,"painted in 1755, a very large painting, fresco, whatever it is, of the last supper and Jesus"
00:00:54,00:00:55,and His disciples.
00:00:55,00:00:58,They're all sitting around a guinea pig which has been char grilled and barbecued.
00:00:58,00:01:01,Is there any chance that they would have eaten a guinea pig back then?
00:01:01,00:01:02,Was that food back then?
00:01:02,00:01:03,Yeah.
00:01:03,00:01:06,"Well not in the Middle East, I didn't think, do they come from the Middle East?"
00:01:06,00:01:09,"Oh sorry, in the Middle East, sorry, I thought you meant were they taking it to South America"
00:01:09,00:01:12,"and because they ate guinea pigs in South America, which they did."
00:01:12,00:01:13,"Which they did, okay."
00:01:13,00:01:14,"Which they did, okay."
00:01:14,00:01:15,"And they still do, they're really popular."
00:01:15,00:01:16,"Yes, huge, yeah."
00:01:16,00:01:18,They eat 65 million every year.
00:01:18,00:01:19,Wow.
00:01:19,00:01:20,It's a lot.
00:01:20,00:01:21,Each.
00:01:21,00:01:26,And they get roasted and impaled on skewers and then they're normally brought to your
00:01:26,00:01:30,table holder and they cut into five pieces so they're quartered and then they remove the
00:01:30,00:01:31,head as well.
00:01:31,00:01:32,What?
00:01:32,00:01:36,Apparently the cheeks are really nice because they're crispy and presumably because they
00:01:36,00:01:38,keep food in them as well so they can't pre-stop.
00:01:38,00:01:39,Yeah.
00:01:39,00:01:42,You've just got some extra seeds.
00:01:42,00:01:43,Yeah.
00:01:43,00:01:48,I was reading that more rabbits and chickens are used as guinea pigs than guinea pigs
00:01:48,00:01:49,are.
00:01:49,00:01:50,Yeah.
00:01:50,00:01:52,For science research.
00:01:52,00:01:58,And obviously mice and rats are the big ones but guinea pigs just are not ever really used
00:01:58,00:02:00,much for science.
00:02:00,00:02:05,"However, I then also read and I read this and this was in Squire, the QI database."
00:02:05,00:02:09,23 Nobel Prizes and Medicine have been one thanks to guinea pigs.
00:02:09,00:02:10,Wow.
00:02:10,00:02:11,Yeah.
00:02:11,00:02:13,"So why did we call, why, why did the term being used as a guinea pig, but was there a time"
00:02:13,00:02:18,"when there were a few, I mean, if 23 Nobel Prizes, there must be a time, yeah."
00:02:18,00:02:22,"It's from the 1800s and it's when the, it was Robert Koch, wasn't it?"
00:02:22,00:02:26,Who was a leading germ scientist in the 1800s and he did a lot of his experiments on guinea
00:02:26,00:02:32,"pigs, I think, in the 1880sish and so he coined the term or someone coined the term about"
00:02:32,00:02:34,him and people just started using it.
00:02:34,00:02:36,"But yeah, it's very uncommon to use guinea pigs."
00:02:36,00:02:43,I think at a ratio of about one to a thousand in favour of using mice and rats instead.
00:02:43,00:02:48,"Guinea pigs are, I think, the only other animals, the only other mammals except for humans"
00:02:48,00:02:49,that can get scurvy.
00:02:49,00:02:55,"And that was one thing we used them for is finding out the cause of scurvy, is transferring"
00:02:55,00:02:56,our scurvy into the guinea pigs.
00:02:56,00:02:59,"No, finding out the cause of scurvy, which we did, but yeah, they can get it."
00:02:59,00:03:04,"So all other animals are able to create vitamin C internally, but we can't, guinea pigs"
00:03:04,00:03:05,can't.
00:03:05,00:03:06,Wow.
00:03:06,00:03:07,We're together in that.
00:03:07,00:03:12,"And also guinea pigs, unrelatedly, were the first creatures to have a pap smear down"
00:03:12,00:03:13,on them.
00:03:13,00:03:14,What?
00:03:14,00:03:15,"You know, a cervical smear."
00:03:15,00:03:16,I know with them.
00:03:16,00:03:17,"Oh, okay."
00:03:17,00:03:18,Cool.
00:03:18,00:03:21,"So, you know, the pap and opalus, whatever he was called, when he went to America, wasn't"
00:03:21,00:03:23,allowed to experiment on any humans.
00:03:23,00:03:26,"And so he just took lots of guinea pigs and had to work out their menstrual cycles, which"
00:03:26,00:03:28,"he found quite difficult, I think, for quite a long time."
00:03:28,00:03:32,"Did he have tiny stirrups for their legs, for the inside of the chairs?"
00:03:32,00:03:33,Yeah.
00:03:33,00:03:38,"And he'd leave them alone in the room to set themselves up and come in, call them the gloves."
00:03:38,00:03:42,"If you've ever seen a guinea pig hobbling a little bit, that's what they've just been"
00:03:42,00:03:43,doing.
00:03:43,00:03:48,Making awkward conversation about plants of the week.
00:03:48,00:03:52,"And a pretty Spanish South America in Peru, in a city called Kuthko, I think, is how it's"
00:03:52,00:03:53,pronounced.
00:03:53,00:03:58,A thousand white guinea pigs were sacrificed every year in the square to appease the
00:03:58,00:04:02,"gods and to stop them, you know, harming the crops and things like that."
00:04:02,00:04:03,Yeah.
00:04:03,00:04:04,Wow.
00:04:04,00:04:07,But there is a ceremony today where you go house to house and you collect loads of guinea
00:04:07,00:04:08,pigs from people.
00:04:08,00:04:10,"It's called a jack-a-sari, I think."
00:04:10,00:04:15,"And then you release them in apparently a mock bullfight, which I think sounds brilliant."
00:04:15,00:04:18,"And a tiny ring, you put tiny horns on them."
00:04:18,00:04:22,"I mean, is it a bullfighting that people pose them?"
00:04:22,00:04:23,"Oh, yeah."
00:04:23,00:04:25,Getting flipped over into the crowd.
00:04:25,00:04:27,Just a Matador versus a guinea pig.
00:04:27,00:04:30,Just had blown a guinea pig run off of me.
00:04:30,00:04:37,"There's all the headlines the next day, three more gourd and guinea pig exits."
00:04:37,00:04:39,Just quickly back to the original fact.
00:04:39,00:04:44,"So this picture of the last supper, was this the Kuthko Cathedral one?"
00:04:44,00:04:45,It was the Kuthko Cathedral.
00:04:45,00:04:46,Yeah.
00:04:46,00:04:50,"Okay, because there's a lot more items on that table as well that they seem to have identified"
00:04:50,00:04:52,as part of the last supper.
00:04:52,00:04:56,"So to represent the 12 disciples, they had 12 dishes on the table."
00:04:56,00:05:05,"So that includes prawn soup, nice, polenta, salad, corn cake, there was rice with milk,"
00:05:05,00:05:06,"cake, yellow bread."
00:05:06,00:05:07,It's quite cool.
00:05:07,00:05:08,It's quite a variety.
00:05:08,00:05:09,It sounds like they've cooked in.
00:05:09,00:05:10,They didn't order out from somewhere.
00:05:10,00:05:11,"Yeah, yeah."
00:05:11,00:05:15,I'm also so skeptical that when people claim to be able to identify very specific types
00:05:15,00:05:16,of food.
00:05:16,00:05:17,"Ah, prawn soup there?"
00:05:17,00:05:18,Yeah.
00:05:18,00:05:19,Yeah.
00:05:19,00:05:23,"One of them is handing the menu back to the waiter, pointing with his finger at the prawn,"
00:05:23,00:05:24,so that's how we know.
00:05:24,00:05:27,There's a special menu in the background if you look very closely.
00:05:27,00:05:31,"Speaking of items on the table, in Davinci's last supper, there's lots of stuff again strune"
00:05:31,00:05:32,over the table.
00:05:32,00:05:36,"The first thing is that there are oranges there, which is a mistake as it were, because"
00:05:36,00:05:40,oranges weren't around in the Middle East until centuries after Jesus was supposed to
00:05:40,00:05:41,be around.
00:05:41,00:05:45,"The second thing is that in 2007, an Italian computer technician announced that he had discovered"
00:05:45,00:05:49,a secret song that was hidden in Davinci's last supper.
00:05:49,00:05:55,"So all this bread and stuff strune over the table, if you superimpose us onto a stave, all"
00:05:55,00:05:59,"of the things are musical notes, and he says that if you play it, it sounds a bit like"
00:05:59,00:06:00,a requiem.
00:06:00,00:06:03,"The crucial thing, not enough like a requiem."
00:06:03,00:06:06,The page of the museum said the theory was plausible.
00:06:06,00:06:07,That's very polite.
00:06:07,00:06:17,"There's another theory by this historian called John Veriano, who thinks that he says there"
00:06:17,00:06:21,"is orange on the table, but he thinks that they're eating eel in Davinci's last supper."
00:06:21,00:06:26,Because apparently that was a popular meal in the 15th century in Italy when Davinci was
00:06:26,00:06:27,painting.
00:06:27,00:06:28,"So, yeah, eel and orange slices."
00:06:28,00:06:33,"There was this thing that he was obviously commissioned to do this, Davinci, this portrait,"
00:06:33,00:06:38,"and it was done in what was effectively a monk's canteen, which I didn't know, but it wasn't"
00:06:38,00:06:40,a canteen when it was painted.
00:06:40,00:06:43,"It was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was so delicious."
00:06:43,00:06:44,Yeah.
00:06:44,00:06:46,"It was, it was, it would be great in this room."
00:06:46,00:06:51,"It's very dilapidated and basically rubbish, isn't it?"
00:06:51,00:06:56,"And in fact, I think, I think, basically rubbish, but basically I could do better."
00:06:56,00:07:03,"I think if you asked who painted Davinci's last supper, the answer would not be Davinci."
00:07:03,00:07:07,"I don't think there's a single bit of paint left now on it, that is Davinci's paint because"
00:07:07,00:07:09,it was so badly done because it was essentially a failure.
00:07:09,00:07:13,"He had never really painted murals before, didn't know the right equipment to use or the right"
00:07:13,00:07:14,substances.
00:07:14,00:07:15,Yeah.
00:07:15,00:07:19,And so they eroded really quickly within his lifetime and it kept on having to be redone
00:07:19,00:07:21,and touched up and it didn't work very well.
00:07:21,00:07:25,And for centuries it was kind of neglected because it was just like broken bits of stone.
00:07:25,00:07:30,"And also the Jesus in the middle used to have feet, didn't he?"
00:07:30,00:07:31,Yes.
00:07:31,00:07:37,And they just plowed a door through the middle of that painting and so the feet are gone
00:07:37,00:07:40,and that's why there's that weird arch in the middle of the painting that looks a bit
00:07:40,00:07:44,out of place and you can't see Jesus' legs.
00:07:44,00:07:46,Did you know that Van Gogh painted a version of the last supper?
00:07:46,00:07:47,"No, it didn't."
00:07:47,00:07:49,"Ah, yeah, he did."
00:07:49,00:07:54,"It was, you know, his Cafe Terrace, most famous Van Gogh painting probably, one of the"
00:07:54,00:07:55,very most famous.
00:07:55,00:07:56,"Oh yeah, it's a Cafe Terrace."
00:07:56,00:07:57,Lots of people sitting out.
00:07:57,00:08:00,"Anyway, there was this academic paper written about how Van Gogh had written her letters"
00:08:00,00:08:03,"brother while he was painting that saying, ""I really need some religion in my life."""
00:08:03,00:08:08,"And then he's drawn this picture with 12 diners with a guy walking away, as in the Judas"
00:08:08,00:08:13,"character who's often shown to be walking away in the last supper depictions, with if you"
00:08:13,00:08:18,look at the window in the back it's got a crossed window pane which isn't just a cross window
00:08:18,00:08:23,"pane, it's the crucifix that's hanging behind every one of the picture."
00:08:23,00:08:24,That's the latest theories.
00:08:24,00:08:28,"There are some other versions of the, there are so many versions of like the last supper"
00:08:28,00:08:29,in painting.
00:08:29,00:08:33,"Yeah, my favourite is Juan de Juane, which was the Spanish painter who painted his version."
00:08:33,00:08:39,"And it's really easy to decipher, to identify which disciple is each person, because inside"
00:08:39,00:08:43,"the halos he's written their names, suspended in the same color."
00:08:43,00:08:46,"Because if you all go in somewhere, you all hang up your halos at the door and then if you"
00:08:46,00:08:49,"leave you don't want to get someone else's, which is the wrong time."
00:08:49,00:08:50,"Well, it's like a video for the rest of the day."
00:08:50,00:08:54,It looks like when you look at the tags on a Facebook photo and everyone's names come
00:08:54,00:08:59,"up and as well as exactly like that, it's really, it's tagging, it's literally tagging, it's"
00:08:59,00:09:00,the best thing ever.
00:09:00,00:09:06,"The disciple is just written them in, it's hilarious."
00:09:06,00:09:10,"Okay, time for fact number two and that is Alex."
00:09:10,00:09:15,"Okay, my fact is that there is a skyscraper in New York with a 400 tonn weight in the top"
00:09:15,00:09:18,which moves around to stop the building from falling over.
00:09:18,00:09:19,That's so cool.
00:09:19,00:09:22,"Okay, so this is actually one of loads of buildings, this was just the first one to have"
00:09:22,00:09:24,"this technology in the US, it's the City Group Centre."
00:09:24,00:09:28,"I mean, everyone has probably heard about how tall buildings often are built on flexible"
00:09:28,00:09:29,foundations.
00:09:29,00:09:31,"They've got, they're basically sitting on big springs."
00:09:31,00:09:35,So it insulates them from earthquakes and it makes them sway slightly.
00:09:35,00:09:38,But another problem with really tall buildings is not just earthquakes.
00:09:38,00:09:41,It's that the wind might blow the motor because they're so big.
00:09:41,00:09:45,"So there's this technology called tuned mass damping, which is basically a really heavy"
00:09:45,00:09:48,"weight, usually several hundred tons heavy."
00:09:48,00:09:51,That's installed in the top floors of the skyscraper and the weight is attached to
00:09:51,00:09:56,pneumatic supports or cables or something and the building has a computer system which works
00:09:56,00:10:00,out which direction the wind is coming from and it shifts the weight into that direction
00:10:00,00:10:03,so that the building leans into the wind slightly and it can reduce the amount that the
00:10:03,00:10:07,"building is swayed by the wind by about 50 percent or sometimes, oh wow, I'm never going"
00:10:07,00:10:10,into any building which has this technique.
00:10:10,00:10:13,"Well, this is the thing, when you start looking into how these buildings stay up and"
00:10:13,00:10:15,"technology reuse, you don't want to go in any of these skyscrapers because they just"
00:10:15,00:10:19,"don't seem, you just, you wonder how any building stays up, even a couple of stories"
00:10:19,00:10:22,high because it's just so sort of scary.
00:10:22,00:10:25,Have you seen how they demolish skyscrapers in Japan?
00:10:25,00:10:27,"No, it is so cool."
00:10:27,00:10:30,They start with the ground floor and they work their way up.
00:10:30,00:10:31,Sorry?
00:10:31,00:10:32,Yeah.
00:10:32,00:10:33,There's also mass in levitations.
00:10:33,00:10:37,"Yeah, just drop down one floor and then they get to, what do you mean?"
00:10:37,00:10:38,Genuinely they do this.
00:10:38,00:10:41,So what they do is they take the ground floor and they replace all the building supports
00:10:41,00:10:43,"with hydraulic jacks, right?"
00:10:43,00:10:49,"So really, really enormous steel pillars to the height of the first floor and they put"
00:10:49,00:10:52,those in place of the proper supports and then they remove all the internal walls and
00:10:52,00:10:56,"supports and then very slowly and carefully, they lower the hydraulic jacks over a period"
00:10:56,00:11:02,"of a couple of hours and then boom, you have now a building which is one story shorter and"
00:11:02,00:11:06,then you do it again and you do it again and you do it again and it's a way of very slowly
00:11:06,00:11:07,just so cool.
00:11:07,00:11:08,Isn't it amazing?
00:11:08,00:11:12,"That's a bit like how cranes, big cranes, put themselves together and dismantle themselves."
00:11:12,00:11:17,"You build the top bit and then you, you know, they're all built in segments like a bit"
00:11:17,00:11:22,like Lego and it slides in the bottom segment and shifts itself up and slides in and obviously
00:11:22,00:11:25,"you're using the actual, you know, the cables in the crane to move this stuff around so it's"
00:11:25,00:11:26,literally building itself.
00:11:26,00:11:30,I've been asking that question for years without ever thinking to Google it.
00:11:30,00:11:32,I've always wanted to know how a crane gets there.
00:11:32,00:11:33,Yeah.
00:11:33,00:11:34,It's amazing.
00:11:34,00:11:35,That's awesome.
00:11:35,00:11:39,"I was going to say talking of cranes, I was looking at the difference between building"
00:11:39,00:11:44,"in different places and one of which is these, this local protective view laws and it's"
00:11:44,00:11:48,basically the idea that there are lots of views from one place from other in London which
00:11:48,00:11:49,you can't obstruct.
00:11:49,00:11:52,"So you know the cheese grater, skyscraper, it's basically it looks like a giant cheese grater"
00:11:52,00:11:56,because it just looks like it has a huge slice chopped off it.
00:11:56,00:11:59,The reason it's that shape is because there's a pub on Fleet Street from which you can see
00:11:59,00:12:04,St Paul's Cathedral and when they tried to build the building they were told they weren't
00:12:04,00:12:05,allowed to impose on the views.
00:12:05,00:12:07,They've had this huge skyscraper now sort of leans one way.
00:12:07,00:12:08,Wow.
00:12:08,00:12:09,Isn't that ridiculous?
00:12:09,00:12:13,There are 13 of the main protected view laws from one park to another landmark which
00:12:13,00:12:15,you can't put anything in front of.
00:12:15,00:12:22,Anna and I went to Greenwich very recently to the museums there and we saw Greenwich mean
00:12:22,00:12:27,"time, the Meridian line and the laser, there's this big green laser that shoots out and so"
00:12:27,00:12:34,"at night that's what you see, it shows you time, it's the line of time and basically what"
00:12:34,00:12:39,happened was a new building structure had gone up across the river and the laser went
00:12:39,00:12:44,directly into one of the rooms of the department block and they complained and so they've had
00:12:44,00:12:46,to change the line of time.
00:12:46,00:12:48,It's just pointing up at higher now because that's so funny.
00:12:48,00:12:50,It's a resident's being slightly nervous.
00:12:50,00:12:53,You're saying it's someone's bedroom right and just hitting his bedroom so you're trying
00:12:53,00:12:55,to sleep with his enormous laser coming through your bedroom.
00:12:55,00:12:56,Huge laser of time.
00:12:56,00:12:57,Yeah.
00:12:57,00:12:58,Yeah.
00:12:58,00:13:02,"And related to that 20 fence venture street which is the huge bulb of skyscraper, the"
00:13:02,00:13:03,walkie-talkie in London.
00:13:03,00:13:04,Yes.
00:13:04,00:13:08,"It hit the headlines in 2013 because it was, it had a big curve front and it was focusing"
00:13:08,00:13:13,on all the suns rays and melting a bit of the paper and some cars on it.
00:13:13,00:13:15,"The architect, he's called Raphael Vinoli, he's done it before."
00:13:15,00:13:20,He designed a massive hotel called the hotel Vardara in Las Vegas which also has a massive
00:13:20,00:13:23,curve front and would heat up the swimming pool and melt people's plastic cups.
00:13:23,00:13:27,"So knowing that he'd done that so we went before, they hired him at all and then B, he came"
00:13:27,00:13:30,up with this design for a new massive curve building like yeah that's probably going
00:13:30,00:13:31,to be fine.
00:13:31,00:13:33,I read that that's called the Vardara death ray.
00:13:33,00:13:34,Yeah.
00:13:34,00:13:35,It's ridiculous.
00:13:35,00:13:38,"The signing buildings that end up being called the death somewhere in the death ray, is it?"
00:13:38,00:13:39,No.
00:13:39,00:13:41,"Okay, absolutely."
00:13:41,00:13:44,Just speaking of things being on one side or another are of a line.
00:13:44,00:13:45,Yes.
00:13:45,00:13:48,This is kind of not relevant to the fact what I found out recently and I like it so much.
00:13:48,00:13:53,"There's a hotel in Europe which is half in France and half in Switzerland, genuinely."
00:13:53,00:13:57,"It's called the hotel Abbes and it was the France in Switzerland, we're trying to swap"
00:13:57,00:14:01,a bit of land because the French wanted a particular bit so they had to concede a bit
00:14:01,00:14:04,and they just conceded a bit of land in 1862 and yeah the border shifted.
00:14:04,00:14:07,But the building stayed where it was.
00:14:07,00:14:11,So the international border goes across the dining room and supposedly across the bed
00:14:11,00:14:12,in the honeymoon suite.
00:14:12,00:14:13,Ooh.
00:14:13,00:14:15,"So you've got a passport guard, right in the middle of it?"
00:14:15,00:14:17,You've got a honeymoon in two different countries.
00:14:17,00:14:18,Yeah.
00:14:18,00:14:19,Which countries?
00:14:19,00:14:20,France and Switzerland.
00:14:20,00:14:21,Switzerland.
00:14:21,00:14:23,I love that area of a passport border control.
00:14:23,00:14:24,Yeah.
00:14:24,00:14:30,"Well, you know how you name your child sometimes after where they were conceded."
00:14:30,00:14:38,So I was reading those kind of classic things that you hear about skyscrapers and one
00:14:38,00:14:42,of the things is if you throw a penny off the Empire State Building it'll drill through
00:14:42,00:14:43,your head.
00:14:43,00:14:48,Is the myth and it is a myth and so it won't actually do any harm to you.
00:14:48,00:14:51,It will kind of float down like a leaf is what they say in a guy.
00:14:51,00:14:56,"A guy actually didn't expect well, obviously he basically said if it hit you it would feel"
00:14:56,00:14:57,like a flick on your head.
00:14:57,00:14:58,Right.
00:14:58,00:14:59,Because it's a flat surface.
00:14:59,00:15:03,It kind of catches the air and like a leaf it kind of just oscillates in that way.
00:15:03,00:15:07,And he did tests in wind tunnels when he was having coins.
00:15:07,00:15:10,"And he said, oh, a few hit, but it felt fine."
00:15:10,00:15:11,But so this is interesting.
00:15:11,00:15:15,I think most people do know now that a penny falling off will do nothing to you.
00:15:15,00:15:16,Yeah.
00:15:16,00:15:21,"However, if you throw a pen off the Empire State Building that can definitely kill you."
00:15:21,00:15:22,Because that is heavier.
00:15:22,00:15:23,Yeah.
00:15:23,00:15:25,And it shoots down like an hour stream line.
00:15:25,00:15:26,Yeah.
00:15:26,00:15:27,Yeah.
00:15:27,00:15:31,And then into the ground it would absolutely just chip the sidewalk.
00:15:31,00:15:32,That's how much force it comes down.
00:15:32,00:15:33,Wow.
00:15:33,00:15:34,Yeah.
00:15:34,00:15:37,200 miles per hour is what it would travel down as like an arrow.
00:15:37,00:15:41,Did you know that fish live in skyscrapers in a way?
00:15:41,00:15:44,Is this the one that's been accidentally overwhelmed by fish?
00:15:44,00:15:45,Or oh.
00:15:45,00:15:51,They live in towers basically beneath oil rigs so you get floating oil rigs and marine
00:15:51,00:15:54,biologists have studied the effects it has on sea life.
00:15:54,00:15:59,And they live in a huge column stretching all the way from the oil rig right to the bottom
00:15:59,00:16:00,of the sea floor.
00:16:00,00:16:02,That life is so much more abundant but only in this one column.
00:16:02,00:16:03,Wow.
00:16:03,00:16:04,Isn't that cool?
00:16:04,00:16:05,Yes.
00:16:05,00:16:06,That's really cool.
00:16:06,00:16:09,Because I suppose you get lots of things falling down from above.
00:16:09,00:16:13,So lots of bottom feeders and things we use sediment from animals which have been living
00:16:13,00:16:14,closer above that.
00:16:14,00:16:17,And then at the top there must be more things growing there which are for fish to eat
00:16:17,00:16:18,at which living it.
00:16:18,00:16:19,The surface.
00:16:19,00:16:20,Yeah.
00:16:20,00:16:21,So it has a whole effect all the way down.
00:16:21,00:16:22,I love it.
00:16:22,00:16:26,Would it be the opposite that in a normal skyscraper you want to be on the top floor because
00:16:26,00:16:27,of the view?
00:16:27,00:16:28,In there one.
00:16:28,00:16:29,Do you want to be closer to the bottom?
00:16:29,00:16:30,Is there a better view down there?
00:16:30,00:16:32,There's not much light I suppose and there's loads of pressure depending on how deep it
00:16:32,00:16:33,gets.
00:16:33,00:16:34,Yeah.
00:16:34,00:16:35,So there's no view at all basically.
00:16:35,00:16:36,Where was it?
00:16:36,00:16:37,Where was it?
00:16:37,00:16:39,There's no light.
00:16:39,00:16:40,Yeah.
00:16:40,00:16:41,Knot sought after real estate.
00:16:41,00:16:42,Yeah.
00:16:42,00:16:43,"If you've already invested, you've made a mistake."
00:16:43,00:16:44,"Oh, damn."
00:16:44,00:16:45,What have you bought?
00:16:45,00:16:46,What did the estate agent say?
00:16:46,00:16:49,I'm actually going to hate me.
00:16:49,00:16:55,"Speaking of fish and buildings, the National Fisheries Development Board, which is the branch"
00:16:55,00:17:01,"of government and Hyderabad and Hyderabad in India, is shaped like a huge fish."
00:17:01,00:17:05,And I think that for all government departments we should have the buildings shaped like what
00:17:05,00:17:06,they are.
00:17:06,00:17:07,Wouldn't that be cool?
00:17:07,00:17:08,"Oh, right."
00:17:08,00:17:14,So like the Department of Defence would be a machine gun or something.
00:17:14,00:17:17,Do these machine guns and war probably not?
00:17:17,00:17:20,But the power of housing would just be a really small city house.
00:17:20,00:17:21,Yeah.
00:17:21,00:17:25,That's a country where lots and lots of the government buildings like this.
00:17:25,00:17:29,And I think it's one of the stands and I think it might be Turkmenistan.
00:17:29,00:17:33,But that's also a very awful dictatorship in lots of ways.
00:17:33,00:17:34,Yeah.
00:17:34,00:17:35,"Don't think it is still, is it?"
00:17:35,00:17:39,"It used to be Wasisface, a crazy guy who named his friend after his wife and stuff."
00:17:39,00:17:41,"Sapa Murat Niyazov, I think, was his name."
00:17:41,00:17:42,Yeah.
00:17:42,00:17:43,You're so right.
00:17:43,00:17:47,"The building that's shaped, it is in Turkmenistan."
00:17:47,00:17:51,The building that's shaped like a book is called the House of Free Creativity in Ashkabat.
00:17:51,00:17:57,And it was opened in 2006 under the previous rule of Sapa Murat Niyazov and all the journalists
00:17:57,00:18:00,who worked in it worked with the state run media.
00:18:00,00:18:03,"There are no foreign media allowed, although they weren't at the time."
00:18:03,00:18:07,And there was also almost no free internet access.
00:18:07,00:18:09,So that was the House of Free Creativity.
00:18:09,00:18:20,That is one of the most well-earned free events available.
00:18:20,00:18:25,"OK, time for fact number three, and that is Chazinski."
00:18:25,00:18:29,My fight is that one of Canada's leading crime writers lost the ability to read without
00:18:29,00:18:32,losing the ability to write.
00:18:32,00:18:35,So it's this guy called Howard Engel.
00:18:35,00:18:36,He's a really famous crime writer in Canada.
00:18:36,00:18:41,"He's created this detective called Benny Kuperman, who is the private eye with the heart"
00:18:41,00:18:43,head and the tender heart.
00:18:43,00:18:46,And he was one of the founders of crime writers of Canada.
00:18:46,00:18:51,He's been the first person to be awarded the Grandmaster Award for crime writing by the
00:18:51,00:18:53,Crime Writers of Canada.
00:18:53,00:19:00,"And in July 2001, he woke up, felt fine, went down, made himself some breakfast, went to pick"
00:19:00,00:19:05,"up the newspaper of his doorstep, looked at the newspaper and it looked like it was written"
00:19:05,00:19:06,in complete gibberish.
00:19:06,00:19:07,So he couldn't read any of it.
00:19:07,00:19:11,He said it looked like it was written in Cyrillic one moment in Korea in the next.
00:19:11,00:19:14,"He said it was remained totally calm, thought I've probably had a stroke."
00:19:14,00:19:16,"Went and woke his son up, said I can't read any more."
00:19:16,00:19:17,Can you take me to hospital?
00:19:17,00:19:20,"He went to hospital, had lots of tests, they confirmed he had a stroke."
00:19:20,00:19:25,"But it turned out, he realized after a while of nurses looking into what had happened,"
00:19:25,00:19:27,that he could still write absolutely perfectly.
00:19:27,00:19:29,So what?
00:19:29,00:19:31,Isn't this mental?
00:19:31,00:19:32,So he's quite an amazing case.
00:19:32,00:19:36,He's worked incredibly hard and Oliver Sachs has written an amazing piece on him.
00:19:36,00:19:39,He's worked really hard to teach himself to read again.
00:19:39,00:19:46,"So basically, he's lost the visual ability to read, so he's turned into a sensory ability"
00:19:46,00:19:47,instead.
00:19:47,00:19:51,"So when he's trying to read, he'll shape out the shape of letters, either with his hand"
00:19:51,00:19:53,"in the air, or actually he reads with his tongue."
00:19:53,00:19:56,"So he makes the shapes of letters on the top of his mouth as he's reading them, because"
00:19:56,00:20:00,"he recognizes the shapes like the touch of them, because he can't recognize it like with"
00:20:00,00:20:03,"his eyes, like the visual cortex part has died."
00:20:03,00:20:07,"And so he said that he bit his tongue recently, and he said that rendered him illiterate"
00:20:07,00:20:08,for weeks and weeks.
00:20:08,00:20:09,Wow.
00:20:09,00:20:14,"But he's taught himself to read again very slowly, but he does go now back over his books and"
00:20:14,00:20:16,properly try and edit them as much as he can.
00:20:16,00:20:20,He's doing it fast enough that he can almost keep up with subtitles on a foreign film.
00:20:20,00:20:23,Like that's how fast he can write with his tongue on the top of his mouth.
00:20:23,00:20:25,He can read half of the subtitles.
00:20:25,00:20:26,He said almost.
00:20:26,00:20:28,I can almost follow the film.
00:20:28,00:20:30,I read that.
00:20:30,00:20:34,"Just quickly, Oliver Sachs, so Oliver Sachs wrote about him in his book The Minds Eye, and"
00:20:34,00:20:39,"he also wrote an afterwards to Engles book, which was called The Man Who Have Got to Read."
00:20:39,00:20:44,"So Oliver Sachs, who's very sadly very ill at the moment, you know him as the man who wrote"
00:20:44,00:20:50,all those great books like Awakening's and the man who mistook his wife for a hat.
00:20:50,00:20:55,"All these people with these amazing psychological, I guess, a disability."
00:20:55,00:20:57,He has one himself and I had no idea.
00:20:57,00:20:58,I think that's why he started.
00:20:58,00:20:59,Is that how it started?
00:20:59,00:21:01,He's got face blindness.
00:21:01,00:21:07,"He can't remember faces, including his own, and he says that he will often be looking into"
00:21:07,00:21:12,"a mirror, apologizing to this man in front of him going, ""I'm sorry, who are you?"""
00:21:12,00:21:14,"And he realized, ""Oh no, that's a mirror."
00:21:14,00:21:15,"That's my own face."""
00:21:15,00:21:16,He just doesn't recognize his own face.
00:21:16,00:21:19,"Wait, but surely he recognizes a mirror."
00:21:19,00:21:23,"If he's got like wool-linked mirrors, then he thinks there's one of them."
00:21:23,00:21:24,She gets smaller mirrors.
00:21:24,00:21:28,"Don't live in a house of mirrors, and you can't recognize your own face."
00:21:28,00:21:32,"Maybe he's of exaggerating, that's a condition."
00:21:32,00:21:35,"Just one more thing on Oliver Sacks quickly, before we go away from him."
00:21:35,00:21:40,"His mother was a surgeon, and she studied under Mary Curie."
00:21:40,00:21:41,Really?
00:21:41,00:21:42,Yeah.
00:21:42,00:21:43,Wow.
00:21:43,00:21:44,That's quite cool.
00:21:44,00:21:45,Has a mother weird stroke effects?
00:21:45,00:21:46,"Oh, yeah."
00:21:46,00:21:49,"Malcolm might, who's a retired Laurie driver, he had a stroke, he lost the ability to feel"
00:21:49,00:21:50,sad.
00:21:50,00:21:51,"He said, ""I'm never depressed."
00:21:51,00:21:53,Being sad wouldn't help anything anyway.
00:21:53,00:21:56,I would definitely rather be happy all the time than the other way around.
00:21:56,00:21:57,"It's an advantage, really."""
00:21:57,00:22:00,"But I mean, he would say that."
00:22:00,00:22:03,"I think it's the only time when you go to the doctor, and they'll be like, ""How are you feeling?"""
00:22:03,00:22:04,"You'll be like, ""Oh, I can't complain."""
00:22:04,00:22:08,"And that's actually, like, I literally can't even know if you don't understand."
00:22:08,00:22:13,"There was a Swiss women in Geneva who had a stroke, and it gave her a phantom third arm,"
00:22:13,00:22:15,which her body completely thought was real.
00:22:15,00:22:18,"So if she was asked to move it, her brain would look like it was moving it."
00:22:18,00:22:22,"If she was asked to scratch herself, if she had an itch, her body would think it had been scratched."
00:22:22,00:22:26,"So that's actually quite useful, if you have an itch, and you're doing something with"
00:22:26,00:22:27,your hands.
00:22:27,00:22:28,"You can have a third arm, you can scratch."
00:22:28,00:22:30,"Or you can give people the finger, and they won't know."
00:22:30,00:22:36,"On amazing brain stuff, you know, you can have, like, a quiet savant."
00:22:36,00:22:41,"So, you know, there are all these savants in the world who, like, have an extraordinary ability"
00:22:41,00:22:45,to retain knowledge or some extraordinary mental ability that goes beyond what the brain
00:22:45,00:22:49,"can normally achieve, and there are actually only 330 of them in the world that we know"
00:22:49,00:22:50,of.
00:22:50,00:22:53,30 of them acquired their abilities after a head injury.
00:22:53,00:22:57,"So you can have a head injury, and it's thought that in these cases, it unleashes a bit of"
00:22:57,00:23:00,the brain that a lot of us don't have access to.
00:23:00,00:23:05,"And that's what causes people, for instance, there's this guy called Derek Amato, who is"
00:23:05,00:23:09,"head on the bottom of a pool, and now he's a master pianist."
00:23:09,00:23:14,"There's another guy called Orlando Cerelle, who was hit with a baseball when he was 10,"
00:23:14,00:23:18,and he's been able to remember the weather for every single day following that accident.
00:23:18,00:23:23,"So, just it knocks a bit of the brain that, like, allows these pathways to connect, which"
00:23:23,00:23:24,couldn't before.
00:23:24,00:23:28,"But is there any concomitant damage that means he can't remember other things, or does"
00:23:28,00:23:29,it not seem to have a...
00:23:29,00:23:30,"I think there might often be, yeah."
00:23:30,00:23:31,Yeah.
00:23:31,00:23:32,Yeah.
00:23:32,00:23:34,"There's a, this is an interesting thing."
00:23:34,00:23:38,"There's a British journalist called A.A. Gill, if you don't know him, he's massive in"
00:23:38,00:23:39,burden.
00:23:39,00:23:44,"He is completely dyslexic, so the point where he can't actually write, he has to dictate"
00:23:44,00:23:49,"every single bit of journalism he's written to someone, and I'd never heard that before."
00:23:49,00:23:50,He's...
00:23:50,00:23:56,It's very pleasing to think that A.A. Gill and Barbara Cartland have something in common.
00:23:56,00:23:57,Yeah.
00:23:57,00:24:01,"She did sort of one sentence paragraphs, really."
00:24:01,00:24:03,"That was, you know, Barbara Cartland's title."
00:24:03,00:24:04,Was it?
00:24:04,00:24:05,Yeah.
00:24:05,00:24:06,"But I mean, prousted that as well."
00:24:06,00:24:10,"Again, I think there's a web of talent here, and I'm not, yeah, I don't want to criticize"
00:24:10,00:24:11,Barbara Cartland.
00:24:11,00:24:15,"We set them all up, Barbara Cartland, A.A. Gill, and Marcel Proust."
00:24:15,00:24:16,What do you say?
00:24:16,00:24:18,I smell a sitcom.
00:24:18,00:24:27,"Okay, time for the final fact of the show, and that is my fact."
00:24:27,00:24:33,"My fact this week is that Steve Wozniak, the co-founder of Apple, and the inventor of the"
00:24:33,00:24:38,"personal computer, met his wife on a dialogue joke call."
00:24:38,00:24:41,Now dialogue joke calls used to be massively popular.
00:24:41,00:24:46,"They were, effectively, you called up a phone line, and the phone just told you were joke."
00:24:46,00:24:48,So it would just have a recording of...
00:24:48,00:24:49,Amazing.
00:24:49,00:24:54,"Yeah, and then it got a bit more advanced, so initially it was just a bunch of jokes that"
00:24:54,00:24:57,"were spoken into a tape recorder, and the tape recorder was the answering machine."
00:24:57,00:25:00,So the answering machine was just playing over and over.
00:25:00,00:25:02,"So it tell you a knock-knock joke, and then it would tell you three men walk into a bar"
00:25:02,00:25:03,joke.
00:25:03,00:25:08,And then it got to the point where someone physically picked up the phone and started
00:25:08,00:25:09,telling you jokes.
00:25:09,00:25:14,"And that's, so Steve Wozniak, before he got into working in creating personal computers."
00:25:14,00:25:16,"Yeah, he's one of the Apple founders."
00:25:16,00:25:19,He is the co-founder of Apple with Steve Jobs.
00:25:19,00:25:23,"He's the other guy, and actually he's the guy who created the personal computer."
00:25:23,00:25:28,"Steve Jobs was the genius who marketed it and helped get it out there, but Woz, as he's"
00:25:28,00:25:30,"known, is the guy who actually invented it."
00:25:30,00:25:34,So he's a big name in our modern time.
00:25:34,00:25:40,"So speaking of people talking robotically on the phone, things like this, recently there"
00:25:40,00:25:43,"was a guy at the New York City Health Department, and he was suspended for 20 days for answering"
00:25:43,00:25:47,the phone in a robotic voice.
00:25:47,00:25:52,"And he did, he sued them over it, although he sued him possibly, but he basically during"
00:25:52,00:25:56,"the trial, he told the judge he wasn't a people person, and he was doing it to avoid banter"
00:25:56,00:26:00,"with people, because people talk very differently to a robotic service."
00:26:00,00:26:03,"If you can give options and answers, you just do it quite quickly, and you get through"
00:26:03,00:26:04,it.
00:26:04,00:26:05,"Yeah, that's the reason he did it."
00:26:05,00:26:06,It was interesting.
00:26:06,00:26:11,"The people who voice Siri, so there's a guy in the UK who voices the male voice and a woman"
00:26:11,00:26:16,"called Susan Bennett in the US, and they were specifically chosen to get to read out and"
00:26:16,00:26:19,"record all the words for Siri, because they have very monotonous voices."
00:26:19,00:26:23,"So they might have trouble anytime they ring someone up, they get hung up, because they"
00:26:23,00:26:24,are seeing their PPI.
00:26:24,00:26:27,"One of those guys is called John Briggs, and his voice is everywhere."
00:26:27,00:26:30,"He's been a voice artist for 30 years, so his voice is really everywhere, but no."
00:26:30,00:26:34,So once a friend of his was walking past his daughter's bedroom and heard John Briggs
00:26:34,00:26:38,"his voice coming from inside, it turned out the child was playing a game with animated penguins"
00:26:38,00:26:40,who all had the voice to...
00:26:40,00:26:41,"A friend, John Briggs."
00:26:41,00:26:46,"At one point, Briggs himself got a phone call from himself trying to sell payment protection"
00:26:46,00:26:47,insurance.
00:26:47,00:26:49,Can you imagine?
00:26:49,00:26:55,"So on Steve Wozniak, so he sounds like the most annoying college student."
00:26:55,00:26:58,"He built this little circuit, I don't even know how the technology would work at all."
00:26:58,00:27:02,"He built a circuit that would jam TV signals, and when they were in college and were watching"
00:27:02,00:27:06,"TV with friends, then he would like trigger the circuit that he'd built in his pocket,"
00:27:06,00:27:10,"so that the TV signal would jam, and then someone would go up, try and fix it."
00:27:10,00:27:14,"And as they fiddle about with the aerial, then he'd stop it from jamming, so the TV would"
00:27:14,00:27:15,be okay.
00:27:15,00:27:18,"Then the person would go back and sit down, he'd put the circuit on again, so they'd go"
00:27:18,00:27:22,"and fix it, and eventually it got to the stage where whenever him and his friends got"
00:27:22,00:27:26,"together and were watching TV, they'd have to have one person all the time holding the"
00:27:26,00:27:31,"aerial, because he could've been his friends, and that was what was required."
00:27:31,00:27:33,How annoying is that?
00:27:33,00:27:38,"I saw Steve Wozniak talk in Edinburgh a few years ago, and I thought I'm listening to one"
00:27:38,00:27:41,"of the greatest, happiest, most enthusiastic."
00:27:41,00:27:46,"He was a prankster, he did a lot of pranks, and there was, there's nothing sinister about"
00:27:46,00:27:48,what he was doing that he was obsessed with pranking.
00:27:48,00:27:49,Didn't he?
00:27:49,00:27:51,Wasn't he one of the people who developed one of the first universal remotes?
00:27:51,00:27:52,Yes.
00:27:52,00:27:53,That is him.
00:27:53,00:27:55,Sounds like he was kind of basing it off.
00:27:55,00:27:56,"Yeah, yeah."
00:27:56,00:28:00,"I mean, that's, he absolutely loved pranking, and that's kind of the thing that when Steve"
00:28:00,00:28:03,"Jobs and him were introduced to each other, that was one of the sentences that said you guys"
00:28:03,00:28:05,will love each other because you're pranksters.
00:28:05,00:28:06,"Because they did freaking, didn't they?"
00:28:06,00:28:07,They did do freaking.
00:28:07,00:28:08,Yes.
00:28:08,00:28:09,Which is basically pranking.
00:28:09,00:28:10,Yeah.
00:28:10,00:28:14,"So just with the dialogue joke thing, he was the first person to set that up in the San Francisco"
00:28:14,00:28:19,"Bay Area, so he ran dialogue joke in the place, and then he eventually went to the phone"
00:28:19,00:28:23,"calls when his wife called him, who is future wife rather."
00:28:23,00:28:27,"His opening words were, ""I bet I can hang up faster than you"" and hung up on her straight"
00:28:27,00:28:28,away.
00:28:28,00:28:31,So she called back immediately and then they started talking.
00:28:31,00:28:32,Not to get.
00:28:32,00:28:33,Yeah.
00:28:33,00:28:34,Not to get straight away.
00:28:34,00:28:36,It was like the opposite of you hang up.
00:28:36,00:28:37,You hang up.
00:28:37,00:28:38,Yeah.
00:28:38,00:28:39,You hang up.
00:28:39,00:28:40,Me hang up.
00:28:40,00:28:41,Hello.
00:28:41,00:28:45,So it was the Apple computer just a massive prank then.
00:28:45,00:28:47,The battery life certainly is.
00:28:47,00:28:48,Whoa.
00:28:48,00:28:51,I was speaking of Apple computer.
00:28:51,00:28:56,Have you heard about the San Francisco recycling centre that's had to put a big call out
00:28:56,00:29:02,"asking for the owner of an Apple computer because this elderly woman, so I think 70-something-year-old"
00:29:02,00:29:05,"woman, her husband had recently died and she got a bunch of stuff out of his attic and"
00:29:05,00:29:09,"she handed it into the recycling centre to SELLON, and it turned out that one of the things"
00:29:09,00:29:13,"that she handed in was an Apple one computer, which is made by Steve Rossignac himself."
00:29:13,00:29:14,Wow.
00:29:14,00:29:15,There are about 200 made.
00:29:15,00:29:18,I think there are about 60 left in the world.
00:29:18,00:29:21,"It's worth $200,000, for which they've sold it."
00:29:21,00:29:24,"And now they owe this woman as part of the, you give things into the recycling centre"
00:29:24,00:29:25,agreement.
00:29:25,00:29:29,"So it's worth $200,000, and they don't know where she is."
00:29:29,00:29:33,So Facebook and Google and loads of different like internet companies have put out-
00:29:33,00:29:36,She's given away her computer.
00:29:36,00:29:40,Maybe have you put a sign up somewhere?
00:29:40,00:29:41,Such a thing.
00:29:41,00:29:43,You don't think they want to go to the money?
00:29:43,00:29:44,Yeah.
00:29:44,00:29:45,While we try emailing her.
00:29:45,00:29:46,Yeah.
00:29:46,00:29:47,My space pays.
00:29:47,00:29:53,But one of the reasons all the Apple won computers so scarce is because when Apple 2 came
00:29:53,00:29:57,"out, Steve Jobs and Steve Rossignac gave all the Apple 1 owners incentives to give them"
00:29:57,00:29:58,back.
00:29:58,00:30:00,"You know, they would give them money off the Apple 2 because Steve Rossignac was the customer"
00:30:00,00:30:01,support.
00:30:01,00:30:02,"And they went, anything went wrong."
00:30:02,00:30:04,They wanted it back to find out what was going on wrong.
00:30:04,00:30:07,And then they destroyed it afterwards.
00:30:07,00:30:08,Just on robots.
00:30:08,00:30:09,Yeah.
00:30:09,00:30:13,"Just going back to robots very briefly, did you know that Samsung has a robot shaped like"
00:30:13,00:30:14,a bottom?
00:30:14,00:30:15,What?
00:30:15,00:30:16,I have seen it.
00:30:16,00:30:19,It repeatedly sits on phones to test them.
00:30:19,00:30:20,Oh my god.
00:30:20,00:30:24,So it's got a pair of jeans on.
00:30:24,00:30:29,That's designed to test what happens when someone sits on their phone and you can see videos
00:30:29,00:30:30,of it working.
00:30:30,00:30:31,It's just...
00:30:31,00:30:35,It will be cheaper to hire someone to do that rather than spend millions developing and
00:30:35,00:30:36,out of it all.
00:30:36,00:30:37,"Well, this is progress."
00:30:37,00:30:38,It's so funny.
00:30:38,00:30:39,"No, I haven't seen that."
00:30:39,00:30:40,That's amazing.
00:30:40,00:30:45,"What I've seen is what I thought you were talking about was someone has, you know how"
00:30:45,00:30:49,"like in video games, if you're playing a car racing game, you can now, obviously, buy"
00:30:49,00:30:53,the wheel you could have years ago or you buy a gun to shoot at the screen.
00:30:53,00:30:59,"There's one which is for trainee doctors, which is for giving rectal exams, and it's just"
00:30:59,00:31:04,a pair of butt cheeks that you're meant to put your hand inside to simulate on the screen.
00:31:04,00:31:06,You can see the patients' room and the patients' reaction.
00:31:06,00:31:07,That's really cool.
00:31:07,00:31:09,You know I'm not showing up on you.
00:31:09,00:31:11,It's just a history game.
00:31:11,00:31:13,"It's for work, I swear."
00:31:13,00:31:14,Sorry.
00:31:14,00:31:18,"Yeah, I wonder if you have to show your medical ID before they actually sell it to you just"
00:31:18,00:31:19,to prove.
00:31:19,00:31:20,Yeah.
00:31:20,00:31:25,"I was looking into how certain people met, what I wanted to look into was the kind of tech"
00:31:25,00:31:27,"giants and see how, because that Steve was in the act."
00:31:27,00:31:28,That's how he met his wife.
00:31:28,00:31:34,"I suddenly thought Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, so Steve Jobs met his wife when she"
00:31:34,00:31:36,came to a talk that he was doing.
00:31:36,00:31:39,"And at the talk, she was trying to get in, but it was completely packed up."
00:31:39,00:31:42,"So she started sitting in the aisles, and then she got told she couldn't see there."
00:31:42,00:31:46,"She saw that there was a row of empty seats in the front row, so she thought, let's just"
00:31:46,00:31:47,go sit there.
00:31:47,00:31:49,"Obviously, reserved."
00:31:49,00:31:53,She sat down in these seats and then income Steve Jobs to sit in the seat to get ready to
00:31:53,00:31:54,go up on stage.
00:31:54,00:32:00,"So she sat right next to him, and she said that she'd want a competition to go out on a date"
00:32:00,00:32:01,with him.
00:32:01,00:32:06,"And he said, oh really, and they kind of just got chatting a bit more."
00:32:06,00:32:08,"And at the end of the evening, he was off to go to a dinner and he thought, do you know"
00:32:08,00:32:09,what?
00:32:09,00:32:10,I'd rather go to dinner with her.
00:32:10,00:32:14,"So he went back and found her and said, how about that competition date?"
00:32:14,00:32:15,And that's how they met.
00:32:15,00:32:18,"And they ended up going out, yeah."
00:32:18,00:32:22,"Did you ever come clean as the whole, let the competition thing was a ruse by the day, Steve?"
00:32:22,00:32:26,Immediately divorced her as well as all things.
00:32:26,00:32:27,"With Bill Gates, this is how it happened."
00:32:27,00:32:34,"Bill Gates was working with this lady called Melinda, who became his wife."
00:32:34,00:32:37,"And he basically, she was at Microsoft."
00:32:37,00:32:40,He eventually built the courage up to ask her out.
00:32:40,00:32:45,"So he went up and he said, could we go out two weeks from this coming Saturday?"
00:32:45,00:32:51,"Not the most romantic, as she said, what?"
00:32:51,00:32:56,"So she said, like, just, you know, why don't you ask me closer to the day so it seems a bit"
00:32:56,00:32:57,more spontaneous.
00:32:57,00:33:02,"But then that night, late that night, he called her and said, how about late tonight?"
00:33:02,00:33:08,"And she went, ah, no, that's too soon, just sort of say three days from now, that's"
00:33:08,00:33:09,night.
00:33:09,00:33:13,"So yeah, so, uh, then she did go out on the date and they got together."
00:33:13,00:33:15,"Yeah, it's very nice."
00:33:15,00:33:18,"And Bill and Melinda Gates, there you go."
00:33:18,00:33:21,We should wrap up very soon because we've been going on way too long.
00:33:21,00:33:23,Does anyone have anything before we wrap up?
00:33:23,00:33:24,No.
00:33:24,00:33:26,"I've got one last thing, just very quickly."
00:33:26,00:33:32,Steve Wozniak is part of a sports team and he's part of the Silicon Valley aftershocks.
00:33:32,00:33:35,Can you guys guess what that team is?
00:33:35,00:33:36,What sport he's playing?
00:33:36,00:33:37,It sounds like an earthquake.
00:33:37,00:33:41,"It does sound like an earthquake, but it has no bearing on what the actual sport is."
00:33:41,00:33:42,"Quidditch, then."
00:33:42,00:33:44,"No, that would be awful, bobbing for apples."
00:33:44,00:33:48,"Oh, that would be very cool, but no, it's a Segway Polo team."
00:33:48,00:33:49,"Oh, yeah."
00:33:49,00:33:50,"Segway Man, isn't it?"
