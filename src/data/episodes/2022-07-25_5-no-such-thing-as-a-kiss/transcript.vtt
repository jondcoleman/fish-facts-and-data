00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680
 We run it on QI a few years ago.

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.160
 Yeah.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.360
 Um, which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.680
 You did a nice, such thing as a fish.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.720
 No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.520
 It says it right there, first paragraph.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.600
 No such thing as a fish.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:23.000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.200
 A new weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.400
 My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting here with three elves, James, Andy, and Anna.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.800
 And once again, we just got around the microphone

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.200
 and we're going to share our favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.640
 So in no particular order, here they are.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:47.040
 All right, so let's begin with you, Anna.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.040
 What's your fact?

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.480
 Uh, so this week I discovered that rats will once the size of hippos.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.520
 That is humongous.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.400
 Yeah, it's pretty big.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.040
 Well, basically, it's not all rats.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.960
 It was discovered in 2008.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.160
 It's called the Josepho Artigasium on AC.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.040
 We'll put that on the website so you can look it up.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.960
 And they think they could have put it up to 2.5 tons.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.160
 Wow.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.920
 So that's like the average hippo, I think, is about 1.5 tons.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.600
 It's a largest-known snake in history.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.440
 This was called titanoboa carogenesis.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.200
 It was about the length of about three or four cars.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.960
 What length would that be?

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.840
 So that is 50 feet long.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.600
 Yeah, well, kind of cars like a Lamborghini or one of those little ones

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.000
 that you can park sideways.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.200
 Strangely.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.600
 Or S6 tend to yelling out the side of it.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.760
 That's-- but no, there is a longer snake that was discovered.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.520
 It's just never fully been authenticated,

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.720
 which was Percy Force at the Great Explorer.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.520
 He was a snake.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.680
 No.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.560
 He claimed to have shot us 62 foot anaconda.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.240
 You know, and he was very reputable as an explorer.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.920
 So he wouldn't have-- he wouldn't have bragged.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.760
 In 1910, Theodore Roosevelt offered a reward to the first person

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.680
 who presented a snake that was 30 feet long.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.160
 And I don't think anyone ever claimed it.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.640
 Well, is that quite clever?

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.920
 Because is that the catch 22 or something similar?

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.000
 Because you've offered this reward once you've shot a 30 foot plus snake.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.320
 How are you transporting it back to show it up?

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.800
 And also, even if you do see a snake that's longer than 30 feet,

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.920
 my first thought would be to run away, not to capture it for a while.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.880
 That's-- you don't have the Hunters' mentality.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.280
 I mean, all people thought like that.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.200
 Stately Huns of England would be much emptier in my footsteps.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.160
 So what else do we know about this wrap?

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.400
 OK, so it was actually found in 1987 in Uruguay.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.280
 It was apparently just put in a box in the Natural History Museum.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.200
 It makes you wonder what else is in boxes at the moment,

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.680
 which people put aside five, 10 years ago.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.160
 Yeah, I thought, oh, deal with that later.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.360
 Remember that new species they found in a market in Cambodia

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.960
 or something?

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:49.800
 Oh, yeah.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.680
 It was thought to be extinct.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.600
 It was the rat.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.920
 And yeah, they thought it was extinct.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:54.480
 They thought it was extinct.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.760
 They found it on a combat app, didn't they?

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.840
 Yeah.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.320
 Well, no, in Laos, well, I remember Bill Bailey.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.600
 His neighbor went to Laos and had a picture

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.600
 of what he thought was a new species of--

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.240
 I think it was porcupine.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.880
 And he showed Bill and Bill took it to someone who

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.000
 studies porcupines and they said, yeah, this is a new species.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.920
 And it was just there sitting in the marketplace.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.680
 And the guy said, as well, that on this table,

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.680
 because it was a bunch of animals being sold for food.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.440
 He was like, there's at least three or four new species

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.640
 we don't know about in science yet sitting on this table.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.760
 That reminds me of another one.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.880
 There was a guy who bought a sea urchin,

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.560
 I think it was, on eBay.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.440
 And that turned out to be a new species.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.880
 Right, first of all, why was he buying a sea urchin on eBay?

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.400
 Remember, in the 19th century, you would have like old explorers

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.760
 would get a load of-- they would go on an exploration.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.320
 They'd buy a load of weird stuff and keep it in their house,

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.240
 like Herms, the Johnson's Museum up the road.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.760
 And I like to think that when I have a bigger house,

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.440
 I'll have a cabinet of curiosities.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.440
 And it'll be just stuff I bought off eBay.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.560
 It's just a new way of exploring and finding new things.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.080
 Yeah.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.680
 Someone recently found some of the first Charlie Chaplin bits

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.480
 of film considered to be lost.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.680
 And that was an eBay purchase.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.000
 Amazing.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.680
 Yeah.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.960
 There's constant finds going on just with the natural world.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.400
 We just need a really big spreadsheet as a humanity.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.760
 And then if we just put everything on there that we don't have,

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.800
 you can just check in according to what you know about.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:17.800
 Like a stock take.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.520
 Yeah, like the internet.

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.360
 What, you can call it whatever you want.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.920
 Then if you want to make up a name for it, that's fine.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.960
 So going back to massive animals,

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.440
 it goes reading about the largest kangaroos.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.160
 And apparently they're extinct now,

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.040
 but they're were kangaroos that were up to nine feet 10

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.160
 tall in Australia.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.200
 And imagine how big that is.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.960
 What kind of ounce could they get?

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.040
 Well, exactly.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.080
 And I read that they were hunted to extinction.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.600
 And that's pretty hardcore hunting, isn't it?

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.400
 They're not like you, James, they're just running away

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.520
 and gone back to eBay.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.920
 But hunting a 10 foot kangaroo.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.920
 With what as well?

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.560
 Yeah, it's not like they were shooting them down with rifles.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.360
 I really like imagining what it would have been like.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.320
 If you were like dropped on Earth any long period of time

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.560
 ago, like three million years ago,

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.200
 it just would have been completely mental.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.480
 Because at the same time that rats were like sporting

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.400
 this enormous size, there were elephants and cypress

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.400
 that weighed only 200 kilograms.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.080
 Oh.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.800
 Yeah, really still pretty, I don't know how big it is.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:16.640
 Do you know what?

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.720
 I genuinely, when I went, oh, for some reason,

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.960
 I thought that was the size of my fist.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.480
 Kid, yeah, yeah.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.960
 200 kilograms.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.640
 I don't know why it sounded so tidy.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.480
 I wasn't thinking about it.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.600
 You have a very inflated sense of human strength as well.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.880
 I don't have the punch.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:32.800
 There's a cool thing.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.080
 So animals shrink 10 times as fast as they grow.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.560
 So in 24 million generations, an animal

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.360
 the size of a mouse can grow into the size of an elephant.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.320
 But it takes a much shorter time for them

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.640
 to shrink back down again, about 2 million generations.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.480
 It must be weird if you fast forward the footage of Earth,

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.440
 let's say, somehow, with some would fill the whole thing.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.120
 Just to watch these animals just one suddenly go,

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.120
 boo, another one go, boo, and the power play between them.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.840
 It would have been a time where elephants would be like,

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.680
 stay away from the massive 20 times the size of us

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:06.880
 things over there.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.720
 And now, a rat would be petrified of a,

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.080
 or not, on elephant's scale of mice,

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.240
 is that a hangover?

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.240
 Is that some easter in a cartoon?

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.480
 I'm definitely in a cartoon.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.480
 Is that not real thing?

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.320
 I don't know.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.080
 I don't know.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.800
 They ask her of bees, I think, but not--

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.320
 I was surprised to learn that Queen Victoria had a rat.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.160
 Did you have that?

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.720
 She had an official rat catcher.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.880
 He doubled his job.

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.120
 He was a rat catcher and a mold destroyer.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.800
 And his name was Jack Black.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.000
 He supposedly also gave a rat to Beatrix Potto.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.120
 Wow.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.560
 And so her book, Samuel Whiskers,

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.280
 is dedicated to the rat of the same name.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.480
 And he was, those job titles were by appointments

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.400
 of Queen Victoria.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.840
 Hang on, you're saying that she had a rat

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.400
 and also a rat catcher.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.360
 And did he catch it?

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.040
 Yes.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.680
 So would she release it?

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.600
 No, she could have said it for him to catch it ceremonially.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.760
 [LAUGHTER]

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.600
 And now, the fourth of August, the catching of the rat begins.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.400
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:13.080
 OK, let's move on to fact number two.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.800
 I was reading this month's 14 times magazine.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.800
 It was an article on the Pope.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.080
 And that's where I found this fact.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.520
 Which is, during his 27-year run as Pope,

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.840
 John Paul II took over 100 ski vacations.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.040
 Very extravagant.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.280
 And he did it-- he did it three a year.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:29.880
 Yeah.

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.280
 He wouldn't have taken as many when he was old.

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.320
 No, no, he did it for about a 15-year period.

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:36.040
 Whoa.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:36.560
 Yeah.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.320
 Well, so he took like 70 years or so.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:39.760
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, he used to sneak out.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.400
 He used to get very bored with the Vatican.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.880
 So they would genuinely-- they would get into a car

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.640
 and they would drive to the mountains.

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:50.080
 And he stayed in a resort with a mate of his who he would go skiing

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.280
 with, and he was a skiing instructor.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:51.960
 And this guy used to--

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.400
 I'd like to think he would be in full guard as well.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.400
 Yeah.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.760
 But his friend said that he skied like a swallow.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:58.280
 Is that good?

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.120
 I don't know.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.560
 I don't know what that means.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.880
 Because swallow is almost famous for not skiing.

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:05.880
 Yeah.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.360
 It's the first thing you think when you say the word swallow.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:08.880
 Yes.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.840
 Not skis.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:12.960
 He was a very sporty guy.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:13.280
 He was.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.200
 Holgen Paul.

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.280
 He was a goalkeeper, wasn't he, when he was a--

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:17.200
 Yeah, he was.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.080
 He played for his school and his university.

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:20.960
 And he might have carried on with World War II.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.160
 Haven't broken out.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.440
 Well, his-- the pitch that he used to play on in his hometown

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.160
 is a sacred site that pilgrims often go.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.080
 If there's a list of places to go,

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.400
 that's one of the places, one of his own fields, yeah.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.200
 Do they take away turf or things like that?

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.840
 The article that I read was an article

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.960
 to do with the fact that a bit of clothing

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.520
 with a stain of his blood was stolen recently.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.400
 And I know that that would be seen as quite sacrilegious

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:45.520
 to steal something like that.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.520
 But it seems that everything that was to do with his

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:48.200
 is being left.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.280
 So I doubt anyone would take any turf out of respect.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:50.760
 That's good.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.400
 Because they see them as kind of holy--

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.000
 I don't know.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.360
 He's going to be probably a saint, if he's not already.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.160
 He's this year.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:58.880
 This April 27th, he's being--

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.200
 He's fast-tracked, isn't he?

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.600
 So people just love relics.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.840
 And I remember reading, I don't know if this is true,

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.000
 but then they gave away relics for free on the internet

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.480
 after he died, so that people wouldn't then

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.800
 start trying to steal and sell relics

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.880
 because they would flood the market with these other ones.

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.000
 There was someone in the 14th or 13th century

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:24.200
 who bit off the finger from the hand of a relic in a church.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.240
 Do you remember this James?

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.880
 I remember that story, but I don't remember.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.600
 You sort of bend down to, oh, please,

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:31.080
 I'll kiss the finger, the holy finger of the holy hand

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.520
 at the saint, and then just bite off a joint

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.320
 and keep it anywhere until he've left.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.360
 Guys, we got it!

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.440
 Did she stop the car?

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.520
 But do you know that he was a member of the Harlem Globetrotters?

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.440
 I did, actually.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.280
 We have that to say that.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:47.280
 Yeah, no, because he was a total sports enthusiast.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.440
 So on top of being a-- on top of skiing,

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.200
 he also spent a lot of time with Muhammad Ali whenever

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.920
 he got the chance to.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.840
 So he was a huge boxing enthusiast.

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.120
 As is the Dalai Lama, loves boxing.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.160
 I don't know what it is about religious heads.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.680
 I should say, though, my source for this is Brian Blessed,

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.040
 who claims he spard with the Dalai Lama when he was a child.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.800
 The Dalai Lama does not look like he threw a weighty punch.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:14.600
 Like, not on your 23 stone fist level at all.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.640
 But he really looks pretty weak, no offense.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:18.800
 Yeah, I suppose.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.960
 [LAUGHTER]

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:24.600
 Anyway, so yeah, I got this fact from the 40-in-times magazine,

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.880
 which is a magazine about the world of strange phenomena.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:27.920
 I highly recommend it.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:28.920
 It's really a magazine.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:29.880
 It's fantastic.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.920
 One of the QALs writes for it, Matt Coward.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:35.200
 He writes a myth-conception column for it, which

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.000
 is like a general ignorance thing, and it's great.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.760
 It shocked me when I read in this article

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.160
 that he went skiing because you kind of imagine

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:45.080
 that popes grew up as religious people straight

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.080
 from the get-go didn't have a life before.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.800
 The latest pope that we have, Pope Francis, one of his early jobs

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.840
 was he was a nightclub bouncer.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.960
 Actually, when you think about it, isn't his role effectively

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.880
 as what a bouncer now?

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:57.640
 No.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:00.680
 He could let you into heaven.

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:01.800
 Who's God in this?

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.360
 Is God the manager of the club?

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.240
 Yeah, God's the owner.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:04.740
 That sounds right.

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:05.560
 God's the owner of the club.

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.440
 I thought God was a DJ, according to that popular hit song.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.560
 God is a DJ.

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:13.080
 Life is a does for what the Pope is the bells.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.200
 Have a ministry of sound.

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:22.680
 Also, Pope Francis, he loves the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:23.180
 Doesn't it?

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:24.880
 And often in his talks, he's sight.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.160
 He'll use examples where he'll say,

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.680
 it's like Frodo in Bilbo.

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.200
 Like, he'll use them as a really funny.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.480
 Yeah, he has a degree in chemistry.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.680
 I wouldn't have expected that.

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:35.520
 And he has one lung.

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:36.880
 He has one lung.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:37.880
 What?

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:38.880
 He has one lung.

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:39.760
 He's the other one.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.840
 He gave it to the poor.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:42.840
 Ah, man.

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.160
 He did do that.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:44.680
 Here's the thing.

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:46.160
 He can't have donated it to the Pope

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.920
 because the Pope is not allowed to donate his organs.

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:49.680
 I read this in that.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:50.520
 It's a philosophical law.

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.040
 Yeah, there was a guy who's a member

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.560
 of the Vatican Health Council, and they asked him about it.

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:56.480
 And he said he couldn't do it,

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.560
 because the body of the Pope effectively

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.760
 belonged to the entire Catholic Church.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.920
 You did a thing about the Pope's dying,

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.960
 or the death of the Pope.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.160
 Yeah, yeah.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.760
 It's basically when a Pope dies.

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:10.240
 I haven't done this for the last two

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.480
 Pope's, but every Pope before they have done,

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:13.840
 to confirm that he's dead.

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:16.040
 They gently tap him on the head with a silver hammer

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:18.320
 and call his name out three times.

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.040
 Hey, Pope!

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.720
 They say his birth name, just to make sure he's really dead.

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:23.400
 It's a tradition.

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.720
 It's a small silver hammer.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.280
 I remember reading the article about when the Pope died,

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.400
 and there was a brilliant line in it.

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.880
 I always remember it's, when a Pope dies,

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.760
 his seals are defaced, and his ring is split into.

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.880
 Which is going to be particularly poignant

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.840
 when the latest one goes, because of his lord of the rings

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.760
 and hobbit.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.800
 That has to be taken to Mount Etna.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:43.640
 That's right.

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.240
 That's right, that's right.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:49.120
 Do you know what, I also was suddenly thinking,

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.360
 I don't know much about how they choose a Pope.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.280
 Like, how do they actually find the next Pope?

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.120
 You know, I could technically be a Pope,

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.840
 as if they could choose me if they wanted to.

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:57.840
 I think you should be.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:00.120
 Because the rule is, I'm pretty sure this is right,

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.920
 the rule is that, as long as you're a baptized

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:04.960
 and confirmed Roman Catholic,

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.680
 you could technically be chosen as a Pope.

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:08.440
 I mean, they usually choose a cardinal,

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.640
 but theoretically, they could just knock on my door

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:11.920
 and say, "You're in."

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:13.720
 The only thing that might stop me is,

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:17.400
 I think I might have been excommunicated already.

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:19.120
 You think you might have been excommunicated?

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:22.120
 Yeah, that's a very hazy light out, isn't it?

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.560
 I was in this nightclub.

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.880
 (laughter)

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.680
 No, what?

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.720
 Don't worry, I know the message.

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:35.080
 But what it is, is there's certain things that,

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:37.440
 if you do them, you can be excommunicated,

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.600
 even without any priest or Pope say,

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:43.320
 so they're just so bad that you are excommunicated.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.760
 And I have done one of these things.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.840
 And that is, mentioning Jesus' foreskin.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:49.680
 Oh.

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:52.920
 Because I was done it again, I was done again.

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:57.560
 James, your chances of being Pope are narrowing all the time.

00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.200
 Well, we've mentioned it on QI,

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:04.240
 and so as part of the team who wrote that script,

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.560
 that means as a Roman Catholic, I think I'm out.

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.240
 Everyone who works on the production has known--

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.080
 Thanks a lot.

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.200
 It's not out of the running.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:12.040
 It's actually you.

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:13.280
 I know you would have made a brilliant Pope.

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:14.840
 Thank you, I know.

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:17.320
 I think it's on the count of, if you're a Roman Catholic,

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:20.520
 the rest of you are going to hell anyway, right?

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.560
 Looking forward to it.

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.400
 So OK, if you were going to be made Pope,

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.120
 they put a new rule in quite recently,

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.240
 which is you have to be under 80 to vote.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.240
 Why do you have to be under 80?

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.120
 That seems unfair.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:34.080
 Anyone who can successfully complete a black run

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.640
 on his fees can vote.

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:40.080
 So do you know how they-- so they obviously select the Pope,

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:43.120
 but they have to ask the Pope first off.

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.680
 It's an official sentence that needs to be said.

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.080
 And they all go, no.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.640
 No, me, I go on, I go on.

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:51.440
 No, so the question that they get asked

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:55.320
 is, do you freely accept your election as supreme pontiff?

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:59.320
 And the one word answer that they give is--

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.440
 Accepto!

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:03.440
 [LAUGHTER]

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.440
 It's so wonderful.

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.960
 That's more Harry Potter than Lord of the Rings.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:07.960
 [LAUGHTER]

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.200
 And then they walk through the door of tears,

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.760
 and then they get fitted with the fisherman's ring,

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:14.600
 which is the ring that you were talking about earlier

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.840
 that we now need to throw into the fires of Mordor.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:19.360
 I just want to say this is pretty non-sequitur,

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:22.400
 but it's my favorite fact about any popes in history.

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:25.320
 In the 15th century, Pope Sixus the Fourth

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:28.280
 granted a formal dispensation to the Cardinal of St.

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:32.320
 Lucia to cool himself by sodomy during the three hot months

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.480
 of June, July, and August.

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:35.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 Amazing.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.440
 That's very thoughtful.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.520
 I'm just so warm.

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:40.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:43.520
 I really think that if I was allowed to commit sodomy,

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:44.960
 I'd be much cooler.

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.600
 And if instead it may be a cold bar.

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.000
 That is an amazing, amazing phrase.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.800
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:52.800 --> 00:16:01.440
 OK, let's move on to fact number three, which is you, James.

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:04.640
 A hundred years ago, a quarter of the residents of New York

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:09.960
 would move house every single May the 1st at exactly 9 a.m.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.440
 That's extraordinary.

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.440
 Why?

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:13.520
 I read this the other day.

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.000
 I can't remember where I came across it,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.560
 but I was just astonished that I hadn't heard it before.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:20.440
 It's just like the kind of thing that I would have come across.

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.480
 And what would happen is people who were renting their houses

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:26.200
 would have a one-year lease, and all the leases

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.880
 would end on the same day.

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:29.760
 And the landlords would up the rent so much

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:31.520
 that they needed to find a better deal.

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:34.880
 And everyone would do this, and everyone would move.

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:36.800
 And it was absolute pandemonium.

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.000
 You're so chaos.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.280
 Oh, I'm surprising.

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:39.800
 Yeah.

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.840
 It sounds terrible system.

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:42.680
 I bet it is.

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:43.960
 When did that go up to?

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:46.840
 That was until the 1940s, I think.

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:50.080
 But I mean, it was more common in the late 19th century,

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.520
 and early 20th century.

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:54.560
 That is such a bad idea.

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:57.560
 I know, because moving is the most stressful thing you can do.

00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.080
 What if you were doing it at the same time

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.160
 as a quarter of all residents of your city?

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.000
 Goodness.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.600
 Maybe it's not that there's something moral-supporty about it.

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:06.280
 And you know, you come out of the street and it's like,

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:08.280
 oh, yeah, it's same for you, hey?

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.160
 A bit like the blitz spirit kind of, right?

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:11.000
 Exactly.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.040
 And something that I read about it was that the big kind

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:18.640
 of important people, suddenly of the city,

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:21.280
 were the Cartman, the people who drove the car--

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:22.920
 who suddenly were treated with respect

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:24.240
 that they'd never seen before.

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:29.280
 People would be bowing to them, calling them Mr. Cartman.

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.480
 And Trista Cartman.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.720
 So whatever your name is, Cartman.

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:34.720
 It's great, guys.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:35.760
 It's great, guys.

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:39.520
 You're not going too long.

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:43.360
 Though it's Anthony Troop's mother wrote about it.

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:46.360
 And I just want to quickly read out this little passage.

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:49.280
 She said, on the 1st of May, the city of New York

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:52.160
 has the appearance of sending off a population flying

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.240
 from the plague, or a town which has

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.440
 surrendered on condition of carrying away

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.680
 all the goods and chattels.

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:00.320
 Everyone I spoke to on the subject,

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:03.200
 complained of this custom, as most annoying.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.680
 But all assured me, it was unavoidable.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.680
 And what I love about this is it's something which

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.240
 is completely, obviously, impractical.

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:11.440
 But people still didn't.

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.480
 And just thought, oh, well, this is obviously the only way.

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:14.880
 We're just going to have to put up with it.

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.960
 And I think that's happened quite a few times in history.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:17.960
 I think it's quite cool.

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:19.520
 In India, at the moment, they're trying

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:24.440
 to change the time by shifting this certain area of India

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:25.840
 by 30 minutes forward.

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:29.800
 They would save 2.7 billion units of electricity every year.

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:31.360
 And that's the reason they want to do it.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.120
 But everyone's petrified of it because they're saying

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.760
 it's going to cause chaos.

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:37.640
 And it just made me think that they like savings

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:40.320
 as a thing that we all just do it.

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:42.760
 We just say, OK, the time has changed.

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:43.760
 That's fine.

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:45.280
 I mean, maybe in the future, that will be--

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:46.360
 They'll just look at it and go, yeah.

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:47.520
 These guys were idiots.

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:50.120
 Remember when they wanted to work out

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:54.640
 where the zero-longitude it was?

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.880
 And it goes through credit now.

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.680
 So we call it GMT.

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.480
 But at the same time, the French wanted to put it

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.200
 through Paris, which means if we'd

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.840
 have done that, it would have been called PMT.

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:08.600
 You were telling me a fact about this whole thing

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:10.400
 of chaotic movement.

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:12.800
 And it was to do with the swapping of--

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.360
 So yeah, this was in Sweden.

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:15.480
 I can't remember what year it was.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.520
 But they always drove on the left-hand side.

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:19.920
 And they decided to drive on the right-hand side.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:22.440
 And they decided to do it all at one time.

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:24.520
 So everyone would drive on the left.

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:25.880
 And then all of a sudden, they would all

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:28.400
 decide to drive on the right at a certain time.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.320
 It's amazing.

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:29.640
 I know.

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:30.800
 Do you want to phase it in gradually?

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.400
 No, no.

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.240
 Defend.

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:34.880
 So what happened once?

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:38.800
 Everyone would drive on the left until 450.

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:40.800
 And then come to a complete stop.

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:43.160
 No one was allowed to drive for 10 minutes.

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.360
 And then everyone would carefully

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:46.280
 move to the right-hand side of the road

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:47.680
 and start driving again.

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:50.680
 And we weren't allowed to start again until 5.

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:51.400
 What did that go?

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.440
 Can you imagine if you were the only person in the country

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.680
 who hadn't got the memo?

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:57.560
 What's going on?

00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:58.560
 That was brilliant.

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.400
 It was kind of what did it work?

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.000
 Well, weirdly, it did.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.040
 And there's lots of pictures that it looks a bit like chaotic,

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.480
 but it was called--

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.720
 I'm going to get this wrong, I'm sure--

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:10.920
 but it's something like, "Hurka Traffic on Lagmingland,"

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:14.280
 or they call it "Dagon H," which means the "H" day.

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:17.080
 And on that day, there were only 125

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:18.720
 reparted traffic accidents.

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:23.480
 But on a normal Monday, there would be between 130 and 198.

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:24.760
 And there were no fatalities.

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:27.120
 So actually, it was a safer day than normal.

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:30.160
 So we should switch sides of the road every single day

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.560
 to keep the utilities down.

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:33.240
 So we've got a moral duty to do that.

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:34.240
 Absolutely.

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:36.240
 You want to put it really into the deal.

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:37.440
 But you would be more careful.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:40.200
 It's like the idea of some innovator

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.680
 has come up with the spike in the middle of the steering

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:46.280
 wheel, which is pointing directly at your heart,

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:49.800
 which would make us all drive very carefully.

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:52.080
 The spike them down at least, yeah.

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:54.320
 I think that's a brilliant idea.

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:55.960
 Don't get an airbag, get a spike.

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.520
 Yes, you really want to be safe.

00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.480
 There would be a lot fewer people hit by cars,

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.520
 but a lot more people driving cars would die.

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:04.240
 You're not a spike related to Jews.

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:06.480
 Another spike I'm afraid of you.

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.800
 Well, I think we can make this a quick autopsy, can we?

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:09.800
 Yeah.

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:12.600
 That wasn't tragically impaled.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:14.440
 Why is he pionned?

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:17.560
 tragically impaled, because he couldn't get the right clutch.

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:23.440
 He just followed it and he had another seat adjustment accident.

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:26.320
 And there's another, even more complicated theory,

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.360
 that actually it wouldn't affect the number of statistics

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:31.040
 we have, because people always drive at the very edge

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.040
 of safety.

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:35.200
 There was a study done on this, I can't remember all the details,

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:36.480
 but there was a study done.

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:38.800
 And it was a level crossing.

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.960
 And they measured how quickly people were driving.

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:44.560
 And it was just about the safest they could do,

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:47.480
 and slam on it, and still not hit the train.

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:50.920
 And then they put a hedge in front of the level crossing.

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:52.920
 So you wouldn't be able to see it until a bit later.

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:54.600
 And they found that people slowed down,

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:57.320
 but only to the extent that they would have to slam on

00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:59.280
 and just amount of them is a trade.

00:21:59.280 --> 00:21:59.800
 Wow.

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:00.600
 Risk takers.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.880
 So going back to the obviously impractical.

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:05.000
 In Micronesia, they had these maps.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.360
 And the maps were made of sticks and made of rope.

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:12.200
 And the maps would be related to the waves,

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.840
 because waves change when they go past islands.

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:18.080
 And so you would look at your map and look at the waves,

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:20.360
 and you'd be able to tell which way to go.

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:23.320
 Now, the waves are not very easy to see.

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:25.520
 If so, you have to somehow detect the waves.

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.000
 And the best way that they found to do it

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.240
 was to put the most sensitive part of your body into the sea,

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.000
 which was your testicles.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.400
 So they would dip their testicles into the ocean

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:35.880
 and measure the waves.

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:37.160
 And then they would look at their map

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.520
 and decide which way to go to get to the next island.

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:41.840
 The thing is, I just like the fact that,

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.560
 I mean, dipping your testicles in the water

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:47.720
 and looking at them up is a completely impractical way.

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:50.000
 They just thought, well, that's the best way we have,

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 which we're just going to do it.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.480
 It's just as well that you don't have to do it today,

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:53.080
 isn't it?

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:53.600
 Excuse me.

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:55.560
 Sorry, do you know the way to the swimming pool?

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.920
 Yeah, they had one second.

00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:58.600
 Got my beaker.

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.600
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:10.360
 OK, let's move on to our final fact of the show.

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:11.840
 Andy, this is your one.

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:16.280
 OK, this is that nobody knows why we kiss.

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:17.520
 Is that you and I on?

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:20.040
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:23.080
 Especially not your life, oh my god, for God's sake.

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:25.600
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:28.400
 There are a couple of theories as to why humans

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:31.840
 kiss each other, as opposed to just for pleasure,

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:33.600
 but all because it feels good.

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:37.480
 But it's not clear with the answer one way or the other.

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:41.240
 Basically, it's between whether we instinctively do it

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:43.480
 or whether it's learned behavior.

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:47.520
 Well, I remember reading that actually it's not historically

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:49.240
 that all cultures kiss, is it?

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:51.840
 So that would imply that it's not--

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:53.320
 It's not instinctive to hear it.

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:54.040
 It's happy, is it?

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:56.880
 I think the theory is to it being instinctual

00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:00.760
 is that mothers would mash up food in their mouths.

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:02.640
 They would chew the food themselves, and they'd transfer it

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:04.120
 into their infant's mouth.

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:06.880
 And so all we're really trying to do when we kiss each other

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:10.920
 is recreate the nice feeling of one's mother regurgitating

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.080
 food into your mouth.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:12.920
 So we all love that.

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:13.880
 Certainly why I do it.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.640
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:19.440
 I read that it was the kind of the global spread of kissing

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:21.720
 as a common thing was done by the Romans.

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:22.320
 I really did.

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:24.280
 They were a vibrant kissing culture, apparently.

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:26.440
 And they maybe brought it in from India.

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:27.280
 Have you read that bit?

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:30.480
 No, but the weird sentence I read is that they did it

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:31.840
 via military conquest.

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:35.360
 So it was actually through war that kissing became a--

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:39.040
 Well, there's much less right now.

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:41.360
 I read about one culture that doesn't kiss.

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:43.480
 These are the people of Mangaya, which

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:45.320
 is an island in the Cook Islands.

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:49.240
 And it's written about them that they don't kiss at all.

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:51.600
 But the way they make up for it is they

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:54.480
 are one of the most sexually active groups of people

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:55.560
 in the world.

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.840
 And I'm going to quote this.

00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:01.200
 At 28 years of age, they average two orgasms

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:04.000
 per night, five to six times a week.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 The expectation is that the male will strive to have his partner

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.400
 have two or three orgasms to his one.

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:11.480
 So basically, they're the most orgasmic people,

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:12.560
 but they don't kiss.

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:14.880
 Or they're the most compulsive liars in the world.

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:17.200
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.560
 I just find you amazing braggers.

00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:20.400
 Yeah.

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:23.040
 And like eight orgasms last night, I don't know how do you?

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:28.600
 I've gone for another three times as many, so nonsense.

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:31.760
 There is a thought that-- I think Kato the elder said this--

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:33.160
 yes, the Romans did like to kiss.

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:35.680
 But there's a theory that Romans kiss their wives

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.320
 to check whether or not they've been drinking.

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:39.280
 And Kato wrote that her husband was considered

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:40.840
 to be acting within his legal right

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:43.320
 if he killed his wife after catching her drinking

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:44.680
 or with alcohol on her breath.

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:45.600
 That's true.

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.640
 Did you guys read that it's only this year

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:50.640
 the 2014 edition of the French Dictionary

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:54.400
 that French kissing is now a word in France?

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:55.080
 This is the word--

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:55.680
 Galache.

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:56.840
 Galache.

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:59.760
 La galache is an ice skating boot.

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:02.840
 And so the new term is the idea of tongues slipping on ice.

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:03.800
 Slipping on ice.

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:05.200
 Yeah, like an ice skating boot.

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:08.880
 They're not as romantic as we have given them credit for.

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:10.800
 They did a lot of slipping on ice, wasn't they?

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:11.800
 Every year.

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:14.240
 I use the official word categorism.

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.080
 Yeah.

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:17.960
 That's why you do so well.

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.200
 There's a book called "The Science of Kissing"

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.200
 by Cheryl Kieschenbaum, which I've really enjoyed.

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.200
 I've read a lot all of it, but some of it.

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:26.000
 The author says that 90% of people

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.120
 can remember that their first kiss

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:29.960
 better than the first time they had sex.

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:32.920
 Is that to do with drunkenness or--

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:33.920
 I don't--

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:35.640
 I don't think that's a very--

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:36.840
 Usually you're fun.

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:39.400
 Yeah, better than--

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:42.760
 Do you guys know the first video footage of a kiss?

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:44.480
 It was actually one of the first films ever

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:45.720
 shown to the public.

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:46.800
 And it was a couple kissing.

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:48.360
 And it was from a scene which

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:51.000
 was in a play called "The Widow Jones."

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.560
 And you can see the video online.

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:54.320
 It was filmed by the Edison company.

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:55.840
 The quote they gave around it was,

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:59.240
 they get ready to kiss, begin to kiss, and kiss and kiss

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:01.720
 in a way that brings down the house every time.

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:02.960
 That was in the description, yeah.

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:05.280
 And so we'll put out on qi.com/podcast.

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:08.160
 You can see the very first recorded video kiss.

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:11.440
 I think you're going to mention the first film

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:13.040
 to win Best Picture.

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:14.560
 This was called "Wings," I think.

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:16.040
 Going off memory, but Andy's nodding.

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:17.720
 So I think he might be right, but there

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:20.000
 is a man-on-man kiss.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:20.880
 Yes, there is.

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:24.440
 It's two soldiers or aviators in the festival.

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:25.080
 Yeah, yeah.

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:26.600
 But we were saying about the Widow Jones

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:27.960
 the first cinematic kiss.

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:30.560
 I just wanted to quickly mention the review

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:33.800
 that it was given by a painter called John Sloan.

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:37.080
 This is also possibly the first film review ever.

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:38.520
 This is in 1896.

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:42.080
 He said the kiss is absolutely disgusting.

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:43.960
 Neither participant is physically attractive.

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:45.920
 And the spectacle of their prolonged past

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:48.760
 during on each other's lips was hard to bear.

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:51.400
 When only life-sized, it was pronounced beastly,

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:53.600
 magnifying to go a gancho in proportions.

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:55.560
 It is absolutely disgusting.

00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:57.880
 Such things call for police interference.

00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:59.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:00.640
 That's amazing.

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:02.480
 Allegedly the first ever film review.

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:03.360
 Police interference.

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:04.080
 Call the police.

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:05.080
 Shut it down.

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:07.280
 He just got out of a difficult relationship.

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:08.520
 Yeah.

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.320
 But if you watch the video as well, it's hilarious

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:12.720
 because they're basically spend half the clip

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:14.080
 with their mouth to each other.

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:15.360
 But they're just chatting to each other.

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:15.860
 Yeah.

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:17.080
 That's not that really close, huh?

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:19.720
 Literally, their mouth's going, oh, yeah, you got it.

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:22.280
 They're talking into each other's mouths almost, yeah.

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:25.640
 Obviously, a lot of cultures have a different way

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:26.680
 of greeting kissing.

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:28.280
 You know, the French will kiss on both cheeks.

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:29.200
 It's always a confusion.

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.640
 You don't know how many times you're kissing.

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:32.040
 For politicians, it's a big problem,

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:34.400
 particularly when they're meeting heads of states

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:37.280
 who, particularly, they shouldn't be seen as having

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:39.360
 an intimate moment with.

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:42.960
 And I learned that Bill Clinton when he was introduced

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.840
 to Yes Arafat, because Yes Arafat's a big hugger.

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.720
 And there's a period where he couldn't just couldn't get a hug

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.600
 from Yes Arafat, so he had to avoid it.

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:53.120
 And the way that he avoided it was that his aides

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:57.040
 taught him jujitsu, so he could call specific moves on Arafat

00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:58.120
 whenever he went in for a hug.

00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:00.720
 Look, through him over his shoulder.

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:01.800
 If you watch some of the footage,

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:05.960
 you'll notice that Arafat suddenly get flipped to the ground.

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:08.520
 No, but so Clinton was actively taught jujitsu

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:10.560
 in order to avoid the Arafat hug.

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:12.760
 Arafat finally got a hug on him, though, at one point.

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:14.600
 There's a photo that you can see there.

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:18.000
 Bill Clinton tries to avoid physical contact.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.960
 [LAUGHTER]

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:23.480
 Michael Lewinsky said that he initially kissed her--

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:25.440
 all the first time he kissed her, it was to shut her up

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:28.520
 about something, because she was rabbating on her words.

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:32.400
 I think she was thinking more charitable interpretation

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.640
 on it than might deserve.

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:37.000
 Maybe she accidentally walked into the Oval Office,

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.280
 and she said, sorry, I got lost.

00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:39.560
 I was looking for the staff room.

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:41.000
 Do you know where it is?

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.840
 I do have a method.

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:45.960
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:47.640
 OK, that's all the time we have for this week.

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:48.600
 That's all of our facts.

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:50.440
 Thank you so much, everyone, for listening.

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:52.680
 That's been another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish."

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:54.320
 If you want to get in contact with any of us

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:55.680
 about the facts that we've been talking about,

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:57.160
 you can find us all on Twitter.

00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:00.080
 Andy, you're on @andruhunter.

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:01.840
 James, you're on @andruhunter.

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:05.080
 Anna, we are almost convincing to get on to Twitter,

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:07.840
 but in the meantime, @quickipedia.

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:09.840
 And I'm @tribaland.

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:11.920
 Also, a special thanks to Emperor Yes

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:14.680
 for the theme tune that they've given us, which is Wasps.

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:16.640
 There's a full version of that song and iTunes

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:19.280
 that you can download or check out those soundclouds

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:22.400
 or follow them on Twitter @empera_yes.

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:26.720
 And if you want to head over to www.qi.com/podcast,

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:29.160
 we're going to have a full page again of all the information,

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:31.800
 extra links to the first kiss, all that sort of stuff.

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:32.600
 You can check it out.

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:35.800
 And we'll see you again next time next week.

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:36.760
 Bye.

00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:39.340
 (upbeat music)

00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:49.340
 (upbeat music)

00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:50.740
 (upbeat music)
