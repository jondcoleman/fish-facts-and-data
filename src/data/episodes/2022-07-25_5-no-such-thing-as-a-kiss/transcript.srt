1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
 We run it on QI a few years ago.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,160
 Yeah.

3
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,360
 Um, which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

4
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,680
 You did a nice, such thing as a fish.

5
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,720
 No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

6
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,520
 It says it right there, first paragraph.

7
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,600
 No such thing as a fish.

8
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:23,000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,200
 A new weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,400
 My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting here with three elves, James, Andy, and Anna.

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,800
 And once again, we just got around the microphone

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,200
 and we're going to share our favorite facts from the last seven days.

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,640
 So in no particular order, here they are.

14
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:47,040
 All right, so let's begin with you, Anna.

15
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,040
 What's your fact?

16
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:52,480
 Uh, so this week I discovered that rats will once the size of hippos.

17
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,520
 That is humongous.

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,400
 Yeah, it's pretty big.

19
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,040
 Well, basically, it's not all rats.

20
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,960
 It was discovered in 2008.

21
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,160
 It's called the Josepho Artigasium on AC.

22
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,040
 We'll put that on the website so you can look it up.

23
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,960
 And they think they could have put it up to 2.5 tons.

24
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,160
 Wow.

25
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,920
 So that's like the average hippo, I think, is about 1.5 tons.

26
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,600
 It's a largest-known snake in history.

27
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,440
 This was called titanoboa carogenesis.

28
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,200
 It was about the length of about three or four cars.

29
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,960
 What length would that be?

30
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,840
 So that is 50 feet long.

31
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,600
 Yeah, well, kind of cars like a Lamborghini or one of those little ones

32
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,000
 that you can park sideways.

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,200
 Strangely.

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,600
 Or S6 tend to yelling out the side of it.

35
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,760
 That's-- but no, there is a longer snake that was discovered.

36
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,520
 It's just never fully been authenticated,

37
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,720
 which was Percy Force at the Great Explorer.

38
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,520
 He was a snake.

39
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,680
 No.

40
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,560
 He claimed to have shot us 62 foot anaconda.

41
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,240
 You know, and he was very reputable as an explorer.

42
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,920
 So he wouldn't have-- he wouldn't have bragged.

43
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,760
 In 1910, Theodore Roosevelt offered a reward to the first person

44
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,680
 who presented a snake that was 30 feet long.

45
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,160
 And I don't think anyone ever claimed it.

46
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,640
 Well, is that quite clever?

47
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,920
 Because is that the catch 22 or something similar?

48
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,000
 Because you've offered this reward once you've shot a 30 foot plus snake.

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,320
 How are you transporting it back to show it up?

50
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,800
 And also, even if you do see a snake that's longer than 30 feet,

51
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,920
 my first thought would be to run away, not to capture it for a while.

52
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,880
 That's-- you don't have the Hunters' mentality.

53
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,280
 I mean, all people thought like that.

54
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,200
 Stately Huns of England would be much emptier in my footsteps.

55
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,160
 So what else do we know about this wrap?

56
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,400
 OK, so it was actually found in 1987 in Uruguay.

57
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,280
 It was apparently just put in a box in the Natural History Museum.

58
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,200
 It makes you wonder what else is in boxes at the moment,

59
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,680
 which people put aside five, 10 years ago.

60
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,160
 Yeah, I thought, oh, deal with that later.

61
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,360
 Remember that new species they found in a market in Cambodia

62
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:48,960
 or something?

63
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,800
 Oh, yeah.

64
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,680
 It was thought to be extinct.

65
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,600
 It was the rat.

66
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,920
 And yeah, they thought it was extinct.

67
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,480
 They thought it was extinct.

68
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,760
 They found it on a combat app, didn't they?

69
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,840
 Yeah.

70
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,320
 Well, no, in Laos, well, I remember Bill Bailey.

71
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,600
 His neighbor went to Laos and had a picture

72
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,600
 of what he thought was a new species of--

73
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,240
 I think it was porcupine.

74
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,880
 And he showed Bill and Bill took it to someone who

75
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,000
 studies porcupines and they said, yeah, this is a new species.

76
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,920
 And it was just there sitting in the marketplace.

77
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,680
 And the guy said, as well, that on this table,

78
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,680
 because it was a bunch of animals being sold for food.

79
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,440
 He was like, there's at least three or four new species

80
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,640
 we don't know about in science yet sitting on this table.

81
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,760
 That reminds me of another one.

82
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,880
 There was a guy who bought a sea urchin,

83
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,560
 I think it was, on eBay.

84
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,440
 And that turned out to be a new species.

85
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:35,880
 Right, first of all, why was he buying a sea urchin on eBay?

86
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:40,400
 Remember, in the 19th century, you would have like old explorers

87
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,760
 would get a load of-- they would go on an exploration.

88
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,320
 They'd buy a load of weird stuff and keep it in their house,

89
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,240
 like Herms, the Johnson's Museum up the road.

90
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,760
 And I like to think that when I have a bigger house,

91
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,440
 I'll have a cabinet of curiosities.

92
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,440
 And it'll be just stuff I bought off eBay.

93
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,560
 It's just a new way of exploring and finding new things.

94
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,080
 Yeah.

95
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,680
 Someone recently found some of the first Charlie Chaplin bits

96
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,480
 of film considered to be lost.

97
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,680
 And that was an eBay purchase.

98
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,000
 Amazing.

99
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,680
 Yeah.

100
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,960
 There's constant finds going on just with the natural world.

101
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,400
 We just need a really big spreadsheet as a humanity.

102
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,760
 And then if we just put everything on there that we don't have,

103
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,800
 you can just check in according to what you know about.

104
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,800
 Like a stock take.

105
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,520
 Yeah, like the internet.

106
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,360
 What, you can call it whatever you want.

107
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,920
 Then if you want to make up a name for it, that's fine.

108
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,960
 So going back to massive animals,

109
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,440
 it goes reading about the largest kangaroos.

110
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,160
 And apparently they're extinct now,

111
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,040
 but they're were kangaroos that were up to nine feet 10

112
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,160
 tall in Australia.

113
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,200
 And imagine how big that is.

114
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,960
 What kind of ounce could they get?

115
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,040
 Well, exactly.

116
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,080
 And I read that they were hunted to extinction.

117
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,600
 And that's pretty hardcore hunting, isn't it?

118
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,400
 They're not like you, James, they're just running away

119
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,520
 and gone back to eBay.

120
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,920
 But hunting a 10 foot kangaroo.

121
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,920
 With what as well?

122
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,560
 Yeah, it's not like they were shooting them down with rifles.

123
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,360
 I really like imagining what it would have been like.

124
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,320
 If you were like dropped on Earth any long period of time

125
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,560
 ago, like three million years ago,

126
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,200
 it just would have been completely mental.

127
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,480
 Because at the same time that rats were like sporting

128
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,400
 this enormous size, there were elephants and cypress

129
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,400
 that weighed only 200 kilograms.

130
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,080
 Oh.

131
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,800
 Yeah, really still pretty, I don't know how big it is.

132
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,640
 Do you know what?

133
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,720
 I genuinely, when I went, oh, for some reason,

134
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,960
 I thought that was the size of my fist.

135
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,480
 Kid, yeah, yeah.

136
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,960
 200 kilograms.

137
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,640
 I don't know why it sounded so tidy.

138
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,480
 I wasn't thinking about it.

139
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,600
 You have a very inflated sense of human strength as well.

140
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,880
 I don't have the punch.

141
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,800
 There's a cool thing.

142
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,080
 So animals shrink 10 times as fast as they grow.

143
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,560
 So in 24 million generations, an animal

144
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,360
 the size of a mouse can grow into the size of an elephant.

145
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,320
 But it takes a much shorter time for them

146
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,640
 to shrink back down again, about 2 million generations.

147
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,480
 It must be weird if you fast forward the footage of Earth,

148
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,440
 let's say, somehow, with some would fill the whole thing.

149
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,120
 Just to watch these animals just one suddenly go,

150
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,120
 boo, another one go, boo, and the power play between them.

151
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,840
 It would have been a time where elephants would be like,

152
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,680
 stay away from the massive 20 times the size of us

153
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,880
 things over there.

154
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,720
 And now, a rat would be petrified of a,

155
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,080
 or not, on elephant's scale of mice,

156
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,240
 is that a hangover?

157
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,240
 Is that some easter in a cartoon?

158
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,480
 I'm definitely in a cartoon.

159
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,480
 Is that not real thing?

160
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,320
 I don't know.

161
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,080
 I don't know.

162
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,800
 They ask her of bees, I think, but not--

163
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,320
 I was surprised to learn that Queen Victoria had a rat.

164
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,160
 Did you have that?

165
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,720
 She had an official rat catcher.

166
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,880
 He doubled his job.

167
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:31,120
 He was a rat catcher and a mold destroyer.

168
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,800
 And his name was Jack Black.

169
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,000
 He supposedly also gave a rat to Beatrix Potto.

170
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,120
 Wow.

171
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,560
 And so her book, Samuel Whiskers,

172
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,280
 is dedicated to the rat of the same name.

173
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,480
 And he was, those job titles were by appointments

174
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,400
 of Queen Victoria.

175
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,840
 Hang on, you're saying that she had a rat

176
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,400
 and also a rat catcher.

177
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,360
 And did he catch it?

178
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,040
 Yes.

179
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,680
 So would she release it?

180
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,600
 No, she could have said it for him to catch it ceremonially.

181
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,760
 [LAUGHTER]

182
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,600
 And now, the fourth of August, the catching of the rat begins.

183
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,400
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

184
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:13,080
 OK, let's move on to fact number two.

185
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,800
 I was reading this month's 14 times magazine.

186
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,800
 It was an article on the Pope.

187
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,080
 And that's where I found this fact.

188
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,520
 Which is, during his 27-year run as Pope,

189
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,840
 John Paul II took over 100 ski vacations.

190
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,040
 Very extravagant.

191
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,280
 And he did it-- he did it three a year.

192
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:29,880
 Yeah.

193
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,280
 He wouldn't have taken as many when he was old.

194
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,320
 No, no, he did it for about a 15-year period.

195
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,040
 Whoa.

196
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,560
 Yeah.

197
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,320
 Well, so he took like 70 years or so.

198
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,760
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, he used to sneak out.

199
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,400
 He used to get very bored with the Vatican.

200
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,880
 So they would genuinely-- they would get into a car

201
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,640
 and they would drive to the mountains.

202
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:50,080
 And he stayed in a resort with a mate of his who he would go skiing

203
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,280
 with, and he was a skiing instructor.

204
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:51,960
 And this guy used to--

205
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,400
 I'd like to think he would be in full guard as well.

206
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,400
 Yeah.

207
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,760
 But his friend said that he skied like a swallow.

208
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,280
 Is that good?

209
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,120
 I don't know.

210
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,560
 I don't know what that means.

211
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,880
 Because swallow is almost famous for not skiing.

212
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,880
 Yeah.

213
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,360
 It's the first thing you think when you say the word swallow.

214
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:08,880
 Yes.

215
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,840
 Not skis.

216
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,960
 He was a very sporty guy.

217
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,280
 He was.

218
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,200
 Holgen Paul.

219
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,280
 He was a goalkeeper, wasn't he, when he was a--

220
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,200
 Yeah, he was.

221
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,080
 He played for his school and his university.

222
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,960
 And he might have carried on with World War II.

223
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,160
 Haven't broken out.

224
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,440
 Well, his-- the pitch that he used to play on in his hometown

225
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,160
 is a sacred site that pilgrims often go.

226
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,080
 If there's a list of places to go,

227
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,400
 that's one of the places, one of his own fields, yeah.

228
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,200
 Do they take away turf or things like that?

229
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,840
 The article that I read was an article

230
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,960
 to do with the fact that a bit of clothing

231
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,520
 with a stain of his blood was stolen recently.

232
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,400
 And I know that that would be seen as quite sacrilegious

233
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,520
 to steal something like that.

234
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,520
 But it seems that everything that was to do with his

235
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,200
 is being left.

236
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,280
 So I doubt anyone would take any turf out of respect.

237
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:50,760
 That's good.

238
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,400
 Because they see them as kind of holy--

239
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,000
 I don't know.

240
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,360
 He's going to be probably a saint, if he's not already.

241
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,160
 He's this year.

242
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,880
 This April 27th, he's being--

243
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,200
 He's fast-tracked, isn't he?

244
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,600
 So people just love relics.

245
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,840
 And I remember reading, I don't know if this is true,

246
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,000
 but then they gave away relics for free on the internet

247
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,480
 after he died, so that people wouldn't then

248
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,800
 start trying to steal and sell relics

249
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,880
 because they would flood the market with these other ones.

250
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,000
 There was someone in the 14th or 13th century

251
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,200
 who bit off the finger from the hand of a relic in a church.

252
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,240
 Do you remember this James?

253
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,880
 I remember that story, but I don't remember.

254
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,600
 You sort of bend down to, oh, please,

255
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,080
 I'll kiss the finger, the holy finger of the holy hand

256
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,520
 at the saint, and then just bite off a joint

257
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,320
 and keep it anywhere until he've left.

258
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,360
 Guys, we got it!

259
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,440
 Did she stop the car?

260
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,520
 But do you know that he was a member of the Harlem Globetrotters?

261
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,440
 I did, actually.

262
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,280
 We have that to say that.

263
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,280
 Yeah, no, because he was a total sports enthusiast.

264
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,440
 So on top of being a-- on top of skiing,

265
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,200
 he also spent a lot of time with Muhammad Ali whenever

266
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,920
 he got the chance to.

267
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,840
 So he was a huge boxing enthusiast.

268
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,120
 As is the Dalai Lama, loves boxing.

269
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,160
 I don't know what it is about religious heads.

270
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,680
 I should say, though, my source for this is Brian Blessed,

271
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,040
 who claims he spard with the Dalai Lama when he was a child.

272
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,800
 The Dalai Lama does not look like he threw a weighty punch.

273
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,600
 Like, not on your 23 stone fist level at all.

274
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,640
 But he really looks pretty weak, no offense.

275
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,800
 Yeah, I suppose.

276
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,960
 [LAUGHTER]

277
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,600
 Anyway, so yeah, I got this fact from the 40-in-times magazine,

278
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,880
 which is a magazine about the world of strange phenomena.

279
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,920
 I highly recommend it.

280
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,920
 It's really a magazine.

281
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,880
 It's fantastic.

282
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,920
 One of the QALs writes for it, Matt Coward.

283
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,200
 He writes a myth-conception column for it, which

284
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,000
 is like a general ignorance thing, and it's great.

285
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,760
 It shocked me when I read in this article

286
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,160
 that he went skiing because you kind of imagine

287
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,080
 that popes grew up as religious people straight

288
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,080
 from the get-go didn't have a life before.

289
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,800
 The latest pope that we have, Pope Francis, one of his early jobs

290
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,840
 was he was a nightclub bouncer.

291
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,960
 Actually, when you think about it, isn't his role effectively

292
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,880
 as what a bouncer now?

293
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,640
 No.

294
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,680
 He could let you into heaven.

295
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,800
 Who's God in this?

296
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,360
 Is God the manager of the club?

297
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,240
 Yeah, God's the owner.

298
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:04,740
 That sounds right.

299
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,560
 God's the owner of the club.

300
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,440
 I thought God was a DJ, according to that popular hit song.

301
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,560
 God is a DJ.

302
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,080
 Life is a does for what the Pope is the bells.

303
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,200
 Have a ministry of sound.

304
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:22,680
 Also, Pope Francis, he loves the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings.

305
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,180
 Doesn't it?

306
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,880
 And often in his talks, he's sight.

307
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,160
 He'll use examples where he'll say,

308
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,680
 it's like Frodo in Bilbo.

309
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,200
 Like, he'll use them as a really funny.

310
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,480
 Yeah, he has a degree in chemistry.

311
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,680
 I wouldn't have expected that.

312
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,520
 And he has one lung.

313
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,880
 He has one lung.

314
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,880
 What?

315
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,880
 He has one lung.

316
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,760
 He's the other one.

317
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,840
 He gave it to the poor.

318
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,840
 Ah, man.

319
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,160
 He did do that.

320
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:44,680
 Here's the thing.

321
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,160
 He can't have donated it to the Pope

322
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,920
 because the Pope is not allowed to donate his organs.

323
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,680
 I read this in that.

324
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,520
 It's a philosophical law.

325
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,040
 Yeah, there was a guy who's a member

326
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,560
 of the Vatican Health Council, and they asked him about it.

327
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,480
 And he said he couldn't do it,

328
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,560
 because the body of the Pope effectively

329
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,760
 belonged to the entire Catholic Church.

330
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,920
 You did a thing about the Pope's dying,

331
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,960
 or the death of the Pope.

332
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,160
 Yeah, yeah.

333
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,760
 It's basically when a Pope dies.

334
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,240
 I haven't done this for the last two

335
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,480
 Pope's, but every Pope before they have done,

336
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,840
 to confirm that he's dead.

337
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,040
 They gently tap him on the head with a silver hammer

338
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,320
 and call his name out three times.

339
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,040
 Hey, Pope!

340
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,720
 They say his birth name, just to make sure he's really dead.

341
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,400
 It's a tradition.

342
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,720
 It's a small silver hammer.

343
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,280
 I remember reading the article about when the Pope died,

344
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,400
 and there was a brilliant line in it.

345
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,880
 I always remember it's, when a Pope dies,

346
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,760
 his seals are defaced, and his ring is split into.

347
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,880
 Which is going to be particularly poignant

348
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,840
 when the latest one goes, because of his lord of the rings

349
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,760
 and hobbit.

350
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,800
 That has to be taken to Mount Etna.

351
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,640
 That's right.

352
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,240
 That's right, that's right.

353
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,120
 Do you know what, I also was suddenly thinking,

354
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,360
 I don't know much about how they choose a Pope.

355
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,280
 Like, how do they actually find the next Pope?

356
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,120
 You know, I could technically be a Pope,

357
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,840
 as if they could choose me if they wanted to.

358
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,840
 I think you should be.

359
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,120
 Because the rule is, I'm pretty sure this is right,

360
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,920
 the rule is that, as long as you're a baptized

361
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,960
 and confirmed Roman Catholic,

362
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,680
 you could technically be chosen as a Pope.

363
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,440
 I mean, they usually choose a cardinal,

364
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,640
 but theoretically, they could just knock on my door

365
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,920
 and say, "You're in."

366
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,720
 The only thing that might stop me is,

367
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,400
 I think I might have been excommunicated already.

368
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,120
 You think you might have been excommunicated?

369
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,120
 Yeah, that's a very hazy light out, isn't it?

370
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,560
 I was in this nightclub.

371
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,880
 (laughter)

372
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,680
 No, what?

373
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,720
 Don't worry, I know the message.

374
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,080
 But what it is, is there's certain things that,

375
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,440
 if you do them, you can be excommunicated,

376
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,600
 even without any priest or Pope say,

377
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,320
 so they're just so bad that you are excommunicated.

378
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,760
 And I have done one of these things.

379
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,840
 And that is, mentioning Jesus' foreskin.

380
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,680
 Oh.

381
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,920
 Because I was done it again, I was done again.

382
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:57,560
 James, your chances of being Pope are narrowing all the time.

383
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,200
 Well, we've mentioned it on QI,

384
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:04,240
 and so as part of the team who wrote that script,

385
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,560
 that means as a Roman Catholic, I think I'm out.

386
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,240
 Everyone who works on the production has known--

387
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,080
 Thanks a lot.

388
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,200
 It's not out of the running.

389
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,040
 It's actually you.

390
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,280
 I know you would have made a brilliant Pope.

391
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,840
 Thank you, I know.

392
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,320
 I think it's on the count of, if you're a Roman Catholic,

393
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,520
 the rest of you are going to hell anyway, right?

394
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,560
 Looking forward to it.

395
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,400
 So OK, if you were going to be made Pope,

396
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,120
 they put a new rule in quite recently,

397
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,240
 which is you have to be under 80 to vote.

398
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,240
 Why do you have to be under 80?

399
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,120
 That seems unfair.

400
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,080
 Anyone who can successfully complete a black run

401
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,640
 on his fees can vote.

402
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,080
 So do you know how they-- so they obviously select the Pope,

403
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,120
 but they have to ask the Pope first off.

404
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,680
 It's an official sentence that needs to be said.

405
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,080
 And they all go, no.

406
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,640
 No, me, I go on, I go on.

407
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,440
 No, so the question that they get asked

408
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,320
 is, do you freely accept your election as supreme pontiff?

409
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,320
 And the one word answer that they give is--

410
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,440
 Accepto!

411
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,440
 [LAUGHTER]

412
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,440
 It's so wonderful.

413
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,960
 That's more Harry Potter than Lord of the Rings.

414
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,960
 [LAUGHTER]

415
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,200
 And then they walk through the door of tears,

416
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,760
 and then they get fitted with the fisherman's ring,

417
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,600
 which is the ring that you were talking about earlier

418
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,840
 that we now need to throw into the fires of Mordor.

419
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,360
 I just want to say this is pretty non-sequitur,

420
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,400
 but it's my favorite fact about any popes in history.

421
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,320
 In the 15th century, Pope Sixus the Fourth

422
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,280
 granted a formal dispensation to the Cardinal of St.

423
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:32,320
 Lucia to cool himself by sodomy during the three hot months

424
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,480
 of June, July, and August.

425
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,000
 [LAUGHTER]

426
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 Amazing.

427
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,440
 That's very thoughtful.

428
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,520
 I'm just so warm.

429
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,360
 [LAUGHTER]

430
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,520
 I really think that if I was allowed to commit sodomy,

431
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,960
 I'd be much cooler.

432
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,600
 And if instead it may be a cold bar.

433
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,000
 That is an amazing, amazing phrase.

434
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,800
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

435
00:15:52,800 --> 00:16:01,440
 OK, let's move on to fact number three, which is you, James.

436
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,640
 A hundred years ago, a quarter of the residents of New York

437
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:09,960
 would move house every single May the 1st at exactly 9 a.m.

438
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,440
 That's extraordinary.

439
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,440
 Why?

440
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,520
 I read this the other day.

441
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,000
 I can't remember where I came across it,

442
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,560
 but I was just astonished that I hadn't heard it before.

443
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,440
 It's just like the kind of thing that I would have come across.

444
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,480
 And what would happen is people who were renting their houses

445
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,200
 would have a one-year lease, and all the leases

446
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,880
 would end on the same day.

447
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,760
 And the landlords would up the rent so much

448
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,520
 that they needed to find a better deal.

449
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,880
 And everyone would do this, and everyone would move.

450
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,800
 And it was absolute pandemonium.

451
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,000
 You're so chaos.

452
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,280
 Oh, I'm surprising.

453
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:39,800
 Yeah.

454
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,840
 It sounds terrible system.

455
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,680
 I bet it is.

456
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,960
 When did that go up to?

457
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,840
 That was until the 1940s, I think.

458
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,080
 But I mean, it was more common in the late 19th century,

459
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,520
 and early 20th century.

460
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,560
 That is such a bad idea.

461
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,560
 I know, because moving is the most stressful thing you can do.

462
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,080
 What if you were doing it at the same time

463
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,160
 as a quarter of all residents of your city?

464
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,000
 Goodness.

465
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,600
 Maybe it's not that there's something moral-supporty about it.

466
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,280
 And you know, you come out of the street and it's like,

467
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,280
 oh, yeah, it's same for you, hey?

468
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,160
 A bit like the blitz spirit kind of, right?

469
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,000
 Exactly.

470
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,040
 And something that I read about it was that the big kind

471
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,640
 of important people, suddenly of the city,

472
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,280
 were the Cartman, the people who drove the car--

473
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,920
 who suddenly were treated with respect

474
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,240
 that they'd never seen before.

475
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,280
 People would be bowing to them, calling them Mr. Cartman.

476
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,480
 And Trista Cartman.

477
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,720
 So whatever your name is, Cartman.

478
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,720
 It's great, guys.

479
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,760
 It's great, guys.

480
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,520
 You're not going too long.

481
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,360
 Though it's Anthony Troop's mother wrote about it.

482
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,360
 And I just want to quickly read out this little passage.

483
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,280
 She said, on the 1st of May, the city of New York

484
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,160
 has the appearance of sending off a population flying

485
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,240
 from the plague, or a town which has

486
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,440
 surrendered on condition of carrying away

487
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,680
 all the goods and chattels.

488
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,320
 Everyone I spoke to on the subject,

489
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,200
 complained of this custom, as most annoying.

490
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,680
 But all assured me, it was unavoidable.

491
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,680
 And what I love about this is it's something which

492
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,240
 is completely, obviously, impractical.

493
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,440
 But people still didn't.

494
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,480
 And just thought, oh, well, this is obviously the only way.

495
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,880
 We're just going to have to put up with it.

496
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,960
 And I think that's happened quite a few times in history.

497
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,960
 I think it's quite cool.

498
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,520
 In India, at the moment, they're trying

499
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,440
 to change the time by shifting this certain area of India

500
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,840
 by 30 minutes forward.

501
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,800
 They would save 2.7 billion units of electricity every year.

502
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,360
 And that's the reason they want to do it.

503
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,120
 But everyone's petrified of it because they're saying

504
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,760
 it's going to cause chaos.

505
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,640
 And it just made me think that they like savings

506
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,320
 as a thing that we all just do it.

507
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,760
 We just say, OK, the time has changed.

508
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,760
 That's fine.

509
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,280
 I mean, maybe in the future, that will be--

510
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,360
 They'll just look at it and go, yeah.

511
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,520
 These guys were idiots.

512
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,120
 Remember when they wanted to work out

513
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:54,640
 where the zero-longitude it was?

514
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,880
 And it goes through credit now.

515
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,680
 So we call it GMT.

516
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,480
 But at the same time, the French wanted to put it

517
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,200
 through Paris, which means if we'd

518
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,840
 have done that, it would have been called PMT.

519
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,600
 You were telling me a fact about this whole thing

520
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,400
 of chaotic movement.

521
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,800
 And it was to do with the swapping of--

522
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,360
 So yeah, this was in Sweden.

523
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,480
 I can't remember what year it was.

524
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,520
 But they always drove on the left-hand side.

525
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,920
 And they decided to drive on the right-hand side.

526
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,440
 And they decided to do it all at one time.

527
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,520
 So everyone would drive on the left.

528
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,880
 And then all of a sudden, they would all

529
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,400
 decide to drive on the right at a certain time.

530
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,320
 It's amazing.

531
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:29,640
 I know.

532
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,800
 Do you want to phase it in gradually?

533
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,400
 No, no.

534
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,240
 Defend.

535
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,880
 So what happened once?

536
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,800
 Everyone would drive on the left until 450.

537
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,800
 And then come to a complete stop.

538
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,160
 No one was allowed to drive for 10 minutes.

539
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,360
 And then everyone would carefully

540
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,280
 move to the right-hand side of the road

541
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,680
 and start driving again.

542
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,680
 And we weren't allowed to start again until 5.

543
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,400
 What did that go?

544
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,440
 Can you imagine if you were the only person in the country

545
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,680
 who hadn't got the memo?

546
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,560
 What's going on?

547
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,560
 That was brilliant.

548
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,400
 It was kind of what did it work?

549
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,000
 Well, weirdly, it did.

550
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,040
 And there's lots of pictures that it looks a bit like chaotic,

551
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,480
 but it was called--

552
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,720
 I'm going to get this wrong, I'm sure--

553
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,920
 but it's something like, "Hurka Traffic on Lagmingland,"

554
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,280
 or they call it "Dagon H," which means the "H" day.

555
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,080
 And on that day, there were only 125

556
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,720
 reparted traffic accidents.

557
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,480
 But on a normal Monday, there would be between 130 and 198.

558
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,760
 And there were no fatalities.

559
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,120
 So actually, it was a safer day than normal.

560
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,160
 So we should switch sides of the road every single day

561
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,560
 to keep the utilities down.

562
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,240
 So we've got a moral duty to do that.

563
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,240
 Absolutely.

564
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,240
 You want to put it really into the deal.

565
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,440
 But you would be more careful.

566
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,200
 It's like the idea of some innovator

567
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,680
 has come up with the spike in the middle of the steering

568
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:46,280
 wheel, which is pointing directly at your heart,

569
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,800
 which would make us all drive very carefully.

570
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,080
 The spike them down at least, yeah.

571
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,320
 I think that's a brilliant idea.

572
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,960
 Don't get an airbag, get a spike.

573
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,520
 Yes, you really want to be safe.

574
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,480
 There would be a lot fewer people hit by cars,

575
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,520
 but a lot more people driving cars would die.

576
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,240
 You're not a spike related to Jews.

577
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,480
 Another spike I'm afraid of you.

578
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,800
 Well, I think we can make this a quick autopsy, can we?

579
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,800
 Yeah.

580
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,600
 That wasn't tragically impaled.

581
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,440
 Why is he pionned?

582
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,560
 tragically impaled, because he couldn't get the right clutch.

583
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:23,440
 He just followed it and he had another seat adjustment accident.

584
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,320
 And there's another, even more complicated theory,

585
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,360
 that actually it wouldn't affect the number of statistics

586
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,040
 we have, because people always drive at the very edge

587
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,040
 of safety.

588
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,200
 There was a study done on this, I can't remember all the details,

589
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,480
 but there was a study done.

590
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,800
 And it was a level crossing.

591
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,960
 And they measured how quickly people were driving.

592
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,560
 And it was just about the safest they could do,

593
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,480
 and slam on it, and still not hit the train.

594
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,920
 And then they put a hedge in front of the level crossing.

595
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,920
 So you wouldn't be able to see it until a bit later.

596
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,600
 And they found that people slowed down,

597
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,320
 but only to the extent that they would have to slam on

598
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,280
 and just amount of them is a trade.

599
00:21:59,280 --> 00:21:59,800
 Wow.

600
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,600
 Risk takers.

601
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,880
 So going back to the obviously impractical.

602
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,000
 In Micronesia, they had these maps.

603
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,360
 And the maps were made of sticks and made of rope.

604
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,200
 And the maps would be related to the waves,

605
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,840
 because waves change when they go past islands.

606
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,080
 And so you would look at your map and look at the waves,

607
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,360
 and you'd be able to tell which way to go.

608
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,320
 Now, the waves are not very easy to see.

609
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,520
 If so, you have to somehow detect the waves.

610
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,000
 And the best way that they found to do it

611
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,240
 was to put the most sensitive part of your body into the sea,

612
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,000
 which was your testicles.

613
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,400
 So they would dip their testicles into the ocean

614
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,880
 and measure the waves.

615
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,160
 And then they would look at their map

616
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,520
 and decide which way to go to get to the next island.

617
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,840
 The thing is, I just like the fact that,

618
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,560
 I mean, dipping your testicles in the water

619
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:47,720
 and looking at them up is a completely impractical way.

620
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,000
 They just thought, well, that's the best way we have,

621
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 which we're just going to do it.

622
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,480
 It's just as well that you don't have to do it today,

623
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,080
 isn't it?

624
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:53,600
 Excuse me.

625
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,560
 Sorry, do you know the way to the swimming pool?

626
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,920
 Yeah, they had one second.

627
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,600
 Got my beaker.

628
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,600
 [LAUGHTER]

629
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:10,360
 OK, let's move on to our final fact of the show.

630
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,840
 Andy, this is your one.

631
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,280
 OK, this is that nobody knows why we kiss.

632
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,520
 Is that you and I on?

633
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,040
 [LAUGHTER]

634
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,080
 Especially not your life, oh my god, for God's sake.

635
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,600
 [LAUGHTER]

636
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,400
 There are a couple of theories as to why humans

637
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,840
 kiss each other, as opposed to just for pleasure,

638
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,600
 but all because it feels good.

639
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,480
 But it's not clear with the answer one way or the other.

640
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:41,240
 Basically, it's between whether we instinctively do it

641
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,480
 or whether it's learned behavior.

642
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,520
 Well, I remember reading that actually it's not historically

643
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,240
 that all cultures kiss, is it?

644
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,840
 So that would imply that it's not--

645
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,320
 It's not instinctive to hear it.

646
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,040
 It's happy, is it?

647
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,880
 I think the theory is to it being instinctual

648
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,760
 is that mothers would mash up food in their mouths.

649
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,640
 They would chew the food themselves, and they'd transfer it

650
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,120
 into their infant's mouth.

651
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,880
 And so all we're really trying to do when we kiss each other

652
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,920
 is recreate the nice feeling of one's mother regurgitating

653
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,080
 food into your mouth.

654
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:12,920
 So we all love that.

655
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,880
 Certainly why I do it.

656
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,640
 [LAUGHTER]

657
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,440
 I read that it was the kind of the global spread of kissing

658
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,720
 as a common thing was done by the Romans.

659
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,320
 I really did.

660
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,280
 They were a vibrant kissing culture, apparently.

661
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,440
 And they maybe brought it in from India.

662
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,280
 Have you read that bit?

663
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,480
 No, but the weird sentence I read is that they did it

664
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,840
 via military conquest.

665
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,360
 So it was actually through war that kissing became a--

666
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,040
 Well, there's much less right now.

667
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,360
 I read about one culture that doesn't kiss.

668
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,480
 These are the people of Mangaya, which

669
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,320
 is an island in the Cook Islands.

670
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:49,240
 And it's written about them that they don't kiss at all.

671
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,600
 But the way they make up for it is they

672
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,480
 are one of the most sexually active groups of people

673
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,560
 in the world.

674
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,840
 And I'm going to quote this.

675
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,200
 At 28 years of age, they average two orgasms

676
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,000
 per night, five to six times a week.

677
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 The expectation is that the male will strive to have his partner

678
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,400
 have two or three orgasms to his one.

679
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,480
 So basically, they're the most orgasmic people,

680
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,560
 but they don't kiss.

681
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,880
 Or they're the most compulsive liars in the world.

682
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,200
 [LAUGHTER]

683
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,560
 I just find you amazing braggers.

684
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,400
 Yeah.

685
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,040
 And like eight orgasms last night, I don't know how do you?

686
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:28,600
 I've gone for another three times as many, so nonsense.

687
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,760
 There is a thought that-- I think Kato the elder said this--

688
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,160
 yes, the Romans did like to kiss.

689
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,680
 But there's a theory that Romans kiss their wives

690
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,320
 to check whether or not they've been drinking.

691
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,280
 And Kato wrote that her husband was considered

692
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,840
 to be acting within his legal right

693
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,320
 if he killed his wife after catching her drinking

694
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,680
 or with alcohol on her breath.

695
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,600
 That's true.

696
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,640
 Did you guys read that it's only this year

697
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,640
 the 2014 edition of the French Dictionary

698
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,400
 that French kissing is now a word in France?

699
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,080
 This is the word--

700
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:55,680
 Galache.

701
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,840
 Galache.

702
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,760
 La galache is an ice skating boot.

703
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,840
 And so the new term is the idea of tongues slipping on ice.

704
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,800
 Slipping on ice.

705
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,200
 Yeah, like an ice skating boot.

706
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,880
 They're not as romantic as we have given them credit for.

707
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,800
 They did a lot of slipping on ice, wasn't they?

708
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,800
 Every year.

709
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,240
 I use the official word categorism.

710
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,080
 Yeah.

711
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,960
 That's why you do so well.

712
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,200
 There's a book called "The Science of Kissing"

713
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,200
 by Cheryl Kieschenbaum, which I've really enjoyed.

714
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,200
 I've read a lot all of it, but some of it.

715
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,000
 The author says that 90% of people

716
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,120
 can remember that their first kiss

717
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,960
 better than the first time they had sex.

718
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,920
 Is that to do with drunkenness or--

719
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,920
 I don't--

720
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,640
 I don't think that's a very--

721
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,840
 Usually you're fun.

722
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,400
 Yeah, better than--

723
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,760
 Do you guys know the first video footage of a kiss?

724
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,480
 It was actually one of the first films ever

725
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,720
 shown to the public.

726
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,800
 And it was a couple kissing.

727
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,360
 And it was from a scene which

728
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:51,000
 was in a play called "The Widow Jones."

729
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,560
 And you can see the video online.

730
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,320
 It was filmed by the Edison company.

731
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,840
 The quote they gave around it was,

732
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,240
 they get ready to kiss, begin to kiss, and kiss and kiss

733
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,720
 in a way that brings down the house every time.

734
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,960
 That was in the description, yeah.

735
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,280
 And so we'll put out on qi.com/podcast.

736
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,160
 You can see the very first recorded video kiss.

737
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,440
 I think you're going to mention the first film

738
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,040
 to win Best Picture.

739
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,560
 This was called "Wings," I think.

740
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,040
 Going off memory, but Andy's nodding.

741
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,720
 So I think he might be right, but there

742
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,000
 is a man-on-man kiss.

743
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,880
 Yes, there is.

744
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,440
 It's two soldiers or aviators in the festival.

745
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,080
 Yeah, yeah.

746
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,600
 But we were saying about the Widow Jones

747
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,960
 the first cinematic kiss.

748
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,560
 I just wanted to quickly mention the review

749
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,800
 that it was given by a painter called John Sloan.

750
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:37,080
 This is also possibly the first film review ever.

751
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,520
 This is in 1896.

752
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:42,080
 He said the kiss is absolutely disgusting.

753
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,960
 Neither participant is physically attractive.

754
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,920
 And the spectacle of their prolonged past

755
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,760
 during on each other's lips was hard to bear.

756
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,400
 When only life-sized, it was pronounced beastly,

757
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,600
 magnifying to go a gancho in proportions.

758
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,560
 It is absolutely disgusting.

759
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,880
 Such things call for police interference.

760
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,840
 [LAUGHTER]

761
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,640
 That's amazing.

762
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,480
 Allegedly the first ever film review.

763
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,360
 Police interference.

764
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,080
 Call the police.

765
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,080
 Shut it down.

766
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,280
 He just got out of a difficult relationship.

767
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,520
 Yeah.

768
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,320
 But if you watch the video as well, it's hilarious

769
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,720
 because they're basically spend half the clip

770
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,080
 with their mouth to each other.

771
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,360
 But they're just chatting to each other.

772
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:15,860
 Yeah.

773
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,080
 That's not that really close, huh?

774
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,720
 Literally, their mouth's going, oh, yeah, you got it.

775
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,280
 They're talking into each other's mouths almost, yeah.

776
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,640
 Obviously, a lot of cultures have a different way

777
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,680
 of greeting kissing.

778
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,280
 You know, the French will kiss on both cheeks.

779
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,200
 It's always a confusion.

780
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,640
 You don't know how many times you're kissing.

781
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,040
 For politicians, it's a big problem,

782
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,400
 particularly when they're meeting heads of states

783
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,280
 who, particularly, they shouldn't be seen as having

784
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,360
 an intimate moment with.

785
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,960
 And I learned that Bill Clinton when he was introduced

786
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,840
 to Yes Arafat, because Yes Arafat's a big hugger.

787
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,720
 And there's a period where he couldn't just couldn't get a hug

788
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,600
 from Yes Arafat, so he had to avoid it.

789
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,120
 And the way that he avoided it was that his aides

790
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,040
 taught him jujitsu, so he could call specific moves on Arafat

791
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,120
 whenever he went in for a hug.

792
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,720
 Look, through him over his shoulder.

793
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,800
 If you watch some of the footage,

794
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,960
 you'll notice that Arafat suddenly get flipped to the ground.

795
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,520
 No, but so Clinton was actively taught jujitsu

796
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,560
 in order to avoid the Arafat hug.

797
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,760
 Arafat finally got a hug on him, though, at one point.

798
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,600
 There's a photo that you can see there.

799
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:18,000
 Bill Clinton tries to avoid physical contact.

800
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,960
 [LAUGHTER]

801
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,480
 Michael Lewinsky said that he initially kissed her--

802
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,440
 all the first time he kissed her, it was to shut her up

803
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,520
 about something, because she was rabbating on her words.

804
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:32,400
 I think she was thinking more charitable interpretation

805
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,640
 on it than might deserve.

806
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,000
 Maybe she accidentally walked into the Oval Office,

807
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,280
 and she said, sorry, I got lost.

808
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,560
 I was looking for the staff room.

809
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,000
 Do you know where it is?

810
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,840
 I do have a method.

811
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,960
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

812
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,640
 OK, that's all the time we have for this week.

813
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,600
 That's all of our facts.

814
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,440
 Thank you so much, everyone, for listening.

815
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,680
 That's been another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish."

816
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,320
 If you want to get in contact with any of us

817
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,680
 about the facts that we've been talking about,

818
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,160
 you can find us all on Twitter.

819
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:00,080
 Andy, you're on @andruhunter.

820
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,840
 James, you're on @andruhunter.

821
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,080
 Anna, we are almost convincing to get on to Twitter,

822
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,840
 but in the meantime, @quickipedia.

823
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,840
 And I'm @tribaland.

824
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,920
 Also, a special thanks to Emperor Yes

825
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,680
 for the theme tune that they've given us, which is Wasps.

826
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,640
 There's a full version of that song and iTunes

827
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,280
 that you can download or check out those soundclouds

828
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,400
 or follow them on Twitter @empera_yes.

829
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:26,720
 And if you want to head over to www.qi.com/podcast,

830
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,160
 we're going to have a full page again of all the information,

831
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,800
 extra links to the first kiss, all that sort of stuff.

832
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,600
 You can check it out.

833
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,800
 And we'll see you again next time next week.

834
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,760
 Bye.

835
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,340
 (upbeat music)

836
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:49,340
 (upbeat music)

837
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,740
 (upbeat music)
