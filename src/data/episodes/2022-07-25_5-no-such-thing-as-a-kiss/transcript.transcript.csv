00:00:00,00:00:01,We run it on QI a few years ago.
00:00:01,00:00:02,Yeah.
00:00:02,00:00:04,"Um, which was, there's no such thing as a fish."
00:00:04,00:00:05,"You did a nice, such thing as a fish."
00:00:05,00:00:09,"No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life."
00:00:09,00:00:11,"It says it right there, first paragraph."
00:00:11,00:00:12,No such thing as a fish.
00:00:12,00:00:23,Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish.
00:00:23,00:00:27,A new weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:00:27,00:00:32,"My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting here with three elves, James, Andy, and Anna."
00:00:32,00:00:34,"And once again, we just got around the microphone"
00:00:34,00:00:37,and we're going to share our favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:37,00:00:39,"So in no particular order, here they are."
00:00:39,00:00:47,"All right, so let's begin with you, Anna."
00:00:47,00:00:48,What's your fact?
00:00:48,00:00:52,"Uh, so this week I discovered that rats will once the size of hippos."
00:00:52,00:00:53,That is humongous.
00:00:53,00:00:54,"Yeah, it's pretty big."
00:00:54,00:00:56,"Well, basically, it's not all rats."
00:00:56,00:00:57,It was discovered in 2008.
00:00:57,00:01:01,It's called the Josepho Artigasium on AC.
00:01:01,00:01:03,We'll put that on the website so you can look it up.
00:01:03,00:01:06,And they think they could have put it up to 2.5 tons.
00:01:06,00:01:08,Wow.
00:01:08,00:01:11,"So that's like the average hippo, I think, is about 1.5 tons."
00:01:11,00:01:14,It's a largest-known snake in history.
00:01:14,00:01:18,This was called titanoboa carogenesis.
00:01:18,00:01:22,It was about the length of about three or four cars.
00:01:22,00:01:23,What length would that be?
00:01:23,00:01:25,So that is 50 feet long.
00:01:25,00:01:28,"Yeah, well, kind of cars like a Lamborghini or one of those little ones"
00:01:28,00:01:30,that you can park sideways.
00:01:30,00:01:31,Strangely.
00:01:31,00:01:34,Or S6 tend to yelling out the side of it.
00:01:34,00:01:36,"That's-- but no, there is a longer snake that was discovered."
00:01:36,00:01:39,"It's just never fully been authenticated,"
00:01:39,00:01:41,which was Percy Force at the Great Explorer.
00:01:41,00:01:42,He was a snake.
00:01:42,00:01:43,No.
00:01:43,00:01:47,He claimed to have shot us 62 foot anaconda.
00:01:47,00:01:50,"You know, and he was very reputable as an explorer."
00:01:50,00:01:51,So he wouldn't have-- he wouldn't have bragged.
00:01:51,00:01:56,"In 1910, Theodore Roosevelt offered a reward to the first person"
00:01:56,00:01:59,who presented a snake that was 30 feet long.
00:01:59,00:02:03,And I don't think anyone ever claimed it.
00:02:03,00:02:04,"Well, is that quite clever?"
00:02:04,00:02:06,Because is that the catch 22 or something similar?
00:02:06,00:02:10,Because you've offered this reward once you've shot a 30 foot plus snake.
00:02:10,00:02:13,How are you transporting it back to show it up?
00:02:13,00:02:16,"And also, even if you do see a snake that's longer than 30 feet,"
00:02:16,00:02:19,"my first thought would be to run away, not to capture it for a while."
00:02:19,00:02:22,That's-- you don't have the Hunters' mentality.
00:02:22,00:02:24,"I mean, all people thought like that."
00:02:24,00:02:28,Stately Huns of England would be much emptier in my footsteps.
00:02:28,00:02:30,So what else do we know about this wrap?
00:02:30,00:02:35,"OK, so it was actually found in 1987 in Uruguay."
00:02:35,00:02:38,It was apparently just put in a box in the Natural History Museum.
00:02:38,00:02:41,"It makes you wonder what else is in boxes at the moment,"
00:02:41,00:02:43,"which people put aside five, 10 years ago."
00:02:43,00:02:45,"Yeah, I thought, oh, deal with that later."
00:02:45,00:02:48,Remember that new species they found in a market in Cambodia
00:02:48,00:02:48,or something?
00:02:48,00:02:49,"Oh, yeah."
00:02:49,00:02:51,It was thought to be extinct.
00:02:51,00:02:52,It was the rat.
00:02:52,00:02:53,"And yeah, they thought it was extinct."
00:02:53,00:02:54,They thought it was extinct.
00:02:54,00:02:55,"They found it on a combat app, didn't they?"
00:02:55,00:02:57,Yeah.
00:02:57,00:03:00,"Well, no, in Laos, well, I remember Bill Bailey."
00:03:00,00:03:03,His neighbor went to Laos and had a picture
00:03:03,00:03:05,of what he thought was a new species of--
00:03:05,00:03:07,I think it was porcupine.
00:03:07,00:03:09,And he showed Bill and Bill took it to someone who
00:03:09,00:03:13,"studies porcupines and they said, yeah, this is a new species."
00:03:13,00:03:14,And it was just there sitting in the marketplace.
00:03:14,00:03:16,"And the guy said, as well, that on this table,"
00:03:16,00:03:18,because it was a bunch of animals being sold for food.
00:03:18,00:03:21,"He was like, there's at least three or four new species"
00:03:21,00:03:23,we don't know about in science yet sitting on this table.
00:03:23,00:03:24,That reminds me of another one.
00:03:24,00:03:26,"There was a guy who bought a sea urchin,"
00:03:26,00:03:28,"I think it was, on eBay."
00:03:28,00:03:30,And that turned out to be a new species.
00:03:30,00:03:35,"Right, first of all, why was he buying a sea urchin on eBay?"
00:03:35,00:03:40,"Remember, in the 19th century, you would have like old explorers"
00:03:40,00:03:42,would get a load of-- they would go on an exploration.
00:03:42,00:03:45,"They'd buy a load of weird stuff and keep it in their house,"
00:03:45,00:03:48,"like Herms, the Johnson's Museum up the road."
00:03:48,00:03:50,"And I like to think that when I have a bigger house,"
00:03:50,00:03:52,I'll have a cabinet of curiosities.
00:03:52,00:03:55,And it'll be just stuff I bought off eBay.
00:03:55,00:03:58,It's just a new way of exploring and finding new things.
00:03:58,00:03:59,Yeah.
00:03:59,00:04:02,Someone recently found some of the first Charlie Chaplin bits
00:04:02,00:04:04,of film considered to be lost.
00:04:04,00:04:05,And that was an eBay purchase.
00:04:05,00:04:06,Amazing.
00:04:06,00:04:06,Yeah.
00:04:06,00:04:09,There's constant finds going on just with the natural world.
00:04:09,00:04:12,We just need a really big spreadsheet as a humanity.
00:04:12,00:04:14,"And then if we just put everything on there that we don't have,"
00:04:14,00:04:16,you can just check in according to what you know about.
00:04:16,00:04:17,Like a stock take.
00:04:17,00:04:20,"Yeah, like the internet."
00:04:20,00:04:22,"What, you can call it whatever you want."
00:04:22,00:04:24,"Then if you want to make up a name for it, that's fine."
00:04:24,00:04:26,"So going back to massive animals,"
00:04:26,00:04:29,it goes reading about the largest kangaroos.
00:04:29,00:04:31,"And apparently they're extinct now,"
00:04:31,00:04:34,but they're were kangaroos that were up to nine feet 10
00:04:34,00:04:36,tall in Australia.
00:04:36,00:04:38,And imagine how big that is.
00:04:38,00:04:39,What kind of ounce could they get?
00:04:39,00:04:41,"Well, exactly."
00:04:41,00:04:44,And I read that they were hunted to extinction.
00:04:44,00:04:46,"And that's pretty hardcore hunting, isn't it?"
00:04:46,00:04:49,"They're not like you, James, they're just running away"
00:04:49,00:04:50,and gone back to eBay.
00:04:50,00:04:52,But hunting a 10 foot kangaroo.
00:04:52,00:04:53,With what as well?
00:04:53,00:04:56,"Yeah, it's not like they were shooting them down with rifles."
00:04:56,00:04:58,I really like imagining what it would have been like.
00:04:58,00:05:01,If you were like dropped on Earth any long period of time
00:05:01,00:05:02,"ago, like three million years ago,"
00:05:02,00:05:04,it just would have been completely mental.
00:05:04,00:05:06,Because at the same time that rats were like sporting
00:05:06,00:05:09,"this enormous size, there were elephants and cypress"
00:05:09,00:05:11,that weighed only 200 kilograms.
00:05:11,00:05:12,Oh.
00:05:12,00:05:15,"Yeah, really still pretty, I don't know how big it is."
00:05:15,00:05:16,Do you know what?
00:05:16,00:05:19,"I genuinely, when I went, oh, for some reason,"
00:05:19,00:05:21,I thought that was the size of my fist.
00:05:21,00:05:23,"Kid, yeah, yeah."
00:05:23,00:05:24,200 kilograms.
00:05:24,00:05:26,I don't know why it sounded so tidy.
00:05:26,00:05:27,I wasn't thinking about it.
00:05:27,00:05:30,You have a very inflated sense of human strength as well.
00:05:30,00:05:31,I don't have the punch.
00:05:31,00:05:32,There's a cool thing.
00:05:32,00:05:37,So animals shrink 10 times as fast as they grow.
00:05:37,00:05:40,"So in 24 million generations, an animal"
00:05:40,00:05:43,the size of a mouse can grow into the size of an elephant.
00:05:43,00:05:45,But it takes a much shorter time for them
00:05:45,00:05:48,"to shrink back down again, about 2 million generations."
00:05:48,00:05:51,"It must be weird if you fast forward the footage of Earth,"
00:05:51,00:05:54,"let's say, somehow, with some would fill the whole thing."
00:05:54,00:05:57,"Just to watch these animals just one suddenly go,"
00:05:57,00:06:01,"boo, another one go, boo, and the power play between them."
00:06:01,00:06:02,"It would have been a time where elephants would be like,"
00:06:02,00:06:05,stay away from the massive 20 times the size of us
00:06:05,00:06:06,things over there.
00:06:06,00:06:09,"And now, a rat would be petrified of a,"
00:06:09,00:06:12,"or not, on elephant's scale of mice,"
00:06:12,00:06:13,is that a hangover?
00:06:13,00:06:15,Is that some easter in a cartoon?
00:06:15,00:06:16,I'm definitely in a cartoon.
00:06:16,00:06:17,Is that not real thing?
00:06:17,00:06:18,I don't know.
00:06:18,00:06:19,I don't know.
00:06:19,00:06:20,"They ask her of bees, I think, but not--"
00:06:20,00:06:23,I was surprised to learn that Queen Victoria had a rat.
00:06:23,00:06:24,Did you have that?
00:06:24,00:06:26,She had an official rat catcher.
00:06:26,00:06:27,He doubled his job.
00:06:27,00:06:31,He was a rat catcher and a mold destroyer.
00:06:31,00:06:32,And his name was Jack Black.
00:06:32,00:06:37,He supposedly also gave a rat to Beatrix Potto.
00:06:37,00:06:38,Wow.
00:06:38,00:06:40,"And so her book, Samuel Whiskers,"
00:06:40,00:06:43,is dedicated to the rat of the same name.
00:06:43,00:06:46,"And he was, those job titles were by appointments"
00:06:46,00:06:47,of Queen Victoria.
00:06:47,00:06:48,"Hang on, you're saying that she had a rat"
00:06:48,00:06:50,and also a rat catcher.
00:06:50,00:06:51,And did he catch it?
00:06:51,00:06:52,Yes.
00:06:52,00:06:53,So would she release it?
00:06:53,00:06:56,"No, she could have said it for him to catch it ceremonially."
00:06:56,00:06:59,[LAUGHTER]
00:06:59,00:07:02,"And now, the fourth of August, the catching of the rat begins."
00:07:02,00:07:04,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:07:04,00:07:13,"OK, let's move on to fact number two."
00:07:13,00:07:15,I was reading this month's 14 times magazine.
00:07:15,00:07:17,It was an article on the Pope.
00:07:17,00:07:19,And that's where I found this fact.
00:07:19,00:07:22,"Which is, during his 27-year run as Pope,"
00:07:22,00:07:25,John Paul II took over 100 ski vacations.
00:07:25,00:07:27,Very extravagant.
00:07:27,00:07:29,And he did it-- he did it three a year.
00:07:29,00:07:29,Yeah.
00:07:29,00:07:32,He wouldn't have taken as many when he was old.
00:07:32,00:07:35,"No, no, he did it for about a 15-year period."
00:07:35,00:07:36,Whoa.
00:07:36,00:07:36,Yeah.
00:07:36,00:07:38,"Well, so he took like 70 years or so."
00:07:38,00:07:39,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, he used to sneak out."
00:07:39,00:07:41,He used to get very bored with the Vatican.
00:07:41,00:07:43,So they would genuinely-- they would get into a car
00:07:43,00:07:45,and they would drive to the mountains.
00:07:45,00:07:50,And he stayed in a resort with a mate of his who he would go skiing
00:07:50,00:07:51,"with, and he was a skiing instructor."
00:07:51,00:07:51,And this guy used to--
00:07:51,00:07:54,I'd like to think he would be in full guard as well.
00:07:54,00:07:55,Yeah.
00:07:55,00:07:57,But his friend said that he skied like a swallow.
00:07:57,00:07:58,Is that good?
00:07:58,00:08:00,I don't know.
00:08:00,00:08:01,I don't know what that means.
00:08:01,00:08:04,Because swallow is almost famous for not skiing.
00:08:04,00:08:05,Yeah.
00:08:05,00:08:08,It's the first thing you think when you say the word swallow.
00:08:08,00:08:08,Yes.
00:08:08,00:08:11,Not skis.
00:08:11,00:08:12,He was a very sporty guy.
00:08:12,00:08:13,He was.
00:08:13,00:08:14,Holgen Paul.
00:08:14,00:08:16,"He was a goalkeeper, wasn't he, when he was a--"
00:08:16,00:08:17,"Yeah, he was."
00:08:17,00:08:19,He played for his school and his university.
00:08:19,00:08:20,And he might have carried on with World War II.
00:08:20,00:08:22,Haven't broken out.
00:08:22,00:08:25,"Well, his-- the pitch that he used to play on in his hometown"
00:08:25,00:08:28,is a sacred site that pilgrims often go.
00:08:28,00:08:30,"If there's a list of places to go,"
00:08:30,00:08:32,"that's one of the places, one of his own fields, yeah."
00:08:32,00:08:34,Do they take away turf or things like that?
00:08:34,00:08:36,The article that I read was an article
00:08:36,00:08:38,to do with the fact that a bit of clothing
00:08:38,00:08:41,with a stain of his blood was stolen recently.
00:08:41,00:08:44,And I know that that would be seen as quite sacrilegious
00:08:44,00:08:45,to steal something like that.
00:08:45,00:08:47,But it seems that everything that was to do with his
00:08:47,00:08:48,is being left.
00:08:48,00:08:50,So I doubt anyone would take any turf out of respect.
00:08:50,00:08:50,That's good.
00:08:50,00:08:52,Because they see them as kind of holy--
00:08:52,00:08:53,I don't know.
00:08:53,00:08:56,"He's going to be probably a saint, if he's not already."
00:08:56,00:08:57,He's this year.
00:08:57,00:08:58,"This April 27th, he's being--"
00:08:58,00:09:00,"He's fast-tracked, isn't he?"
00:09:00,00:09:01,So people just love relics.
00:09:01,00:09:03,"And I remember reading, I don't know if this is true,"
00:09:03,00:09:07,but then they gave away relics for free on the internet
00:09:07,00:09:09,"after he died, so that people wouldn't then"
00:09:09,00:09:11,start trying to steal and sell relics
00:09:11,00:09:14,because they would flood the market with these other ones.
00:09:14,00:09:18,There was someone in the 14th or 13th century
00:09:18,00:09:24,who bit off the finger from the hand of a relic in a church.
00:09:24,00:09:25,Do you remember this James?
00:09:25,00:09:26,"I remember that story, but I don't remember."
00:09:26,00:09:28,"You sort of bend down to, oh, please,"
00:09:28,00:09:31,"I'll kiss the finger, the holy finger of the holy hand"
00:09:31,00:09:33,"at the saint, and then just bite off a joint"
00:09:33,00:09:35,and keep it anywhere until he've left.
00:09:35,00:09:37,"Guys, we got it!"
00:09:37,00:09:39,Did she stop the car?
00:09:39,00:09:42,But do you know that he was a member of the Harlem Globetrotters?
00:09:42,00:09:43,"I did, actually."
00:09:43,00:09:44,We have that to say that.
00:09:44,00:09:47,"Yeah, no, because he was a total sports enthusiast."
00:09:47,00:09:50,"So on top of being a-- on top of skiing,"
00:09:50,00:09:53,he also spent a lot of time with Muhammad Ali whenever
00:09:53,00:09:55,he got the chance to.
00:09:55,00:09:57,So he was a huge boxing enthusiast.
00:09:57,00:10:00,"As is the Dalai Lama, loves boxing."
00:10:00,00:10:02,I don't know what it is about religious heads.
00:10:02,00:10:05,"I should say, though, my source for this is Brian Blessed,"
00:10:05,00:10:08,who claims he spard with the Dalai Lama when he was a child.
00:10:08,00:10:10,The Dalai Lama does not look like he threw a weighty punch.
00:10:10,00:10:14,"Like, not on your 23 stone fist level at all."
00:10:14,00:10:17,"But he really looks pretty weak, no offense."
00:10:17,00:10:18,"Yeah, I suppose."
00:10:18,00:10:20,[LAUGHTER]
00:10:20,00:10:24,"Anyway, so yeah, I got this fact from the 40-in-times magazine,"
00:10:24,00:10:26,which is a magazine about the world of strange phenomena.
00:10:26,00:10:27,I highly recommend it.
00:10:27,00:10:28,It's really a magazine.
00:10:28,00:10:29,It's fantastic.
00:10:29,00:10:31,"One of the QALs writes for it, Matt Coward."
00:10:31,00:10:35,"He writes a myth-conception column for it, which"
00:10:35,00:10:37,"is like a general ignorance thing, and it's great."
00:10:37,00:10:38,It shocked me when I read in this article
00:10:38,00:10:41,that he went skiing because you kind of imagine
00:10:41,00:10:45,that popes grew up as religious people straight
00:10:45,00:10:47,from the get-go didn't have a life before.
00:10:47,00:10:49,"The latest pope that we have, Pope Francis, one of his early jobs"
00:10:49,00:10:51,was he was a nightclub bouncer.
00:10:51,00:10:53,"Actually, when you think about it, isn't his role effectively"
00:10:53,00:10:56,as what a bouncer now?
00:10:56,00:10:57,No.
00:10:57,00:11:00,He could let you into heaven.
00:11:00,00:11:01,Who's God in this?
00:11:01,00:11:03,Is God the manager of the club?
00:11:03,00:11:04,"Yeah, God's the owner."
00:11:04,00:11:04,That sounds right.
00:11:04,00:11:05,God's the owner of the club.
00:11:05,00:11:08,"I thought God was a DJ, according to that popular hit song."
00:11:08,00:11:09,God is a DJ.
00:11:09,00:11:13,Life is a does for what the Pope is the bells.
00:11:13,00:11:14,Have a ministry of sound.
00:11:14,00:11:22,"Also, Pope Francis, he loves the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings."
00:11:22,00:11:23,Doesn't it?
00:11:23,00:11:24,"And often in his talks, he's sight."
00:11:24,00:11:27,"He'll use examples where he'll say,"
00:11:27,00:11:28,it's like Frodo in Bilbo.
00:11:28,00:11:31,"Like, he'll use them as a really funny."
00:11:31,00:11:33,"Yeah, he has a degree in chemistry."
00:11:33,00:11:34,I wouldn't have expected that.
00:11:34,00:11:35,And he has one lung.
00:11:35,00:11:36,He has one lung.
00:11:36,00:11:37,What?
00:11:37,00:11:38,He has one lung.
00:11:38,00:11:39,He's the other one.
00:11:39,00:11:41,He gave it to the poor.
00:11:41,00:11:42,"Ah, man."
00:11:42,00:11:44,He did do that.
00:11:44,00:11:44,Here's the thing.
00:11:44,00:11:46,He can't have donated it to the Pope
00:11:46,00:11:48,because the Pope is not allowed to donate his organs.
00:11:48,00:11:49,I read this in that.
00:11:49,00:11:50,It's a philosophical law.
00:11:50,00:11:53,"Yeah, there was a guy who's a member"
00:11:53,00:11:55,"of the Vatican Health Council, and they asked him about it."
00:11:55,00:11:56,"And he said he couldn't do it,"
00:11:56,00:11:58,because the body of the Pope effectively
00:11:58,00:12:00,belonged to the entire Catholic Church.
00:12:00,00:12:03,"You did a thing about the Pope's dying,"
00:12:03,00:12:05,or the death of the Pope.
00:12:05,00:12:07,"Yeah, yeah."
00:12:07,00:12:08,It's basically when a Pope dies.
00:12:08,00:12:10,I haven't done this for the last two
00:12:10,00:12:12,"Pope's, but every Pope before they have done,"
00:12:12,00:12:13,to confirm that he's dead.
00:12:13,00:12:16,They gently tap him on the head with a silver hammer
00:12:16,00:12:18,and call his name out three times.
00:12:18,00:12:20,"Hey, Pope!"
00:12:20,00:12:22,"They say his birth name, just to make sure he's really dead."
00:12:22,00:12:23,It's a tradition.
00:12:23,00:12:24,It's a small silver hammer.
00:12:24,00:12:27,"I remember reading the article about when the Pope died,"
00:12:27,00:12:29,and there was a brilliant line in it.
00:12:29,00:12:31,"I always remember it's, when a Pope dies,"
00:12:31,00:12:34,"his seals are defaced, and his ring is split into."
00:12:34,00:12:36,Which is going to be particularly poignant
00:12:36,00:12:38,"when the latest one goes, because of his lord of the rings"
00:12:38,00:12:40,and hobbit.
00:12:40,00:12:42,That has to be taken to Mount Etna.
00:12:42,00:12:43,That's right.
00:12:43,00:12:45,"That's right, that's right."
00:12:45,00:12:49,"Do you know what, I also was suddenly thinking,"
00:12:49,00:12:51,I don't know much about how they choose a Pope.
00:12:51,00:12:53,"Like, how do they actually find the next Pope?"
00:12:53,00:12:55,"You know, I could technically be a Pope,"
00:12:55,00:12:56,as if they could choose me if they wanted to.
00:12:56,00:12:57,I think you should be.
00:12:57,00:13:00,"Because the rule is, I'm pretty sure this is right,"
00:13:00,00:13:02,"the rule is that, as long as you're a baptized"
00:13:02,00:13:04,"and confirmed Roman Catholic,"
00:13:04,00:13:06,you could technically be chosen as a Pope.
00:13:06,00:13:08,"I mean, they usually choose a cardinal,"
00:13:08,00:13:10,"but theoretically, they could just knock on my door"
00:13:10,00:13:11,"and say, ""You're in."""
00:13:11,00:13:13,"The only thing that might stop me is,"
00:13:13,00:13:17,I think I might have been excommunicated already.
00:13:17,00:13:19,You think you might have been excommunicated?
00:13:19,00:13:22,"Yeah, that's a very hazy light out, isn't it?"
00:13:22,00:13:24,I was in this nightclub.
00:13:24,00:13:26,(laughter)
00:13:26,00:13:28,"No, what?"
00:13:28,00:13:30,"Don't worry, I know the message."
00:13:30,00:13:35,"But what it is, is there's certain things that,"
00:13:35,00:13:37,"if you do them, you can be excommunicated,"
00:13:37,00:13:39,"even without any priest or Pope say,"
00:13:39,00:13:43,so they're just so bad that you are excommunicated.
00:13:43,00:13:45,And I have done one of these things.
00:13:45,00:13:48,"And that is, mentioning Jesus' foreskin."
00:13:48,00:13:49,Oh.
00:13:49,00:13:52,"Because I was done it again, I was done again."
00:13:52,00:13:57,"James, your chances of being Pope are narrowing all the time."
00:13:57,00:13:59,"Well, we've mentioned it on QI,"
00:13:59,00:14:04,"and so as part of the team who wrote that script,"
00:14:04,00:14:06,"that means as a Roman Catholic, I think I'm out."
00:14:06,00:14:09,Everyone who works on the production has known--
00:14:09,00:14:10,Thanks a lot.
00:14:10,00:14:11,It's not out of the running.
00:14:11,00:14:12,It's actually you.
00:14:12,00:14:13,I know you would have made a brilliant Pope.
00:14:13,00:14:14,"Thank you, I know."
00:14:14,00:14:17,"I think it's on the count of, if you're a Roman Catholic,"
00:14:17,00:14:20,"the rest of you are going to hell anyway, right?"
00:14:20,00:14:22,Looking forward to it.
00:14:22,00:14:25,"So OK, if you were going to be made Pope,"
00:14:25,00:14:27,"they put a new rule in quite recently,"
00:14:27,00:14:29,which is you have to be under 80 to vote.
00:14:29,00:14:30,Why do you have to be under 80?
00:14:30,00:14:31,That seems unfair.
00:14:31,00:14:34,Anyone who can successfully complete a black run
00:14:34,00:14:36,on his fees can vote.
00:14:36,00:14:40,"So do you know how they-- so they obviously select the Pope,"
00:14:40,00:14:43,but they have to ask the Pope first off.
00:14:43,00:14:45,It's an official sentence that needs to be said.
00:14:45,00:14:47,"And they all go, no."
00:14:47,00:14:49,"No, me, I go on, I go on."
00:14:49,00:14:51,"No, so the question that they get asked"
00:14:51,00:14:55,"is, do you freely accept your election as supreme pontiff?"
00:14:55,00:14:59,And the one word answer that they give is--
00:14:59,00:15:00,Accepto!
00:15:00,00:15:03,[LAUGHTER]
00:15:03,00:15:04,It's so wonderful.
00:15:04,00:15:06,That's more Harry Potter than Lord of the Rings.
00:15:06,00:15:07,[LAUGHTER]
00:15:07,00:15:10,"And then they walk through the door of tears,"
00:15:10,00:15:12,"and then they get fitted with the fisherman's ring,"
00:15:12,00:15:14,which is the ring that you were talking about earlier
00:15:14,00:15:16,that we now need to throw into the fires of Mordor.
00:15:16,00:15:19,"I just want to say this is pretty non-sequitur,"
00:15:19,00:15:22,but it's my favorite fact about any popes in history.
00:15:22,00:15:25,"In the 15th century, Pope Sixus the Fourth"
00:15:25,00:15:28,granted a formal dispensation to the Cardinal of St.
00:15:28,00:15:32,Lucia to cool himself by sodomy during the three hot months
00:15:32,00:15:34,"of June, July, and August."
00:15:34,00:15:35,[LAUGHTER]
00:15:35,00:15:36,Amazing.
00:15:36,00:15:37,That's very thoughtful.
00:15:37,00:15:39,I'm just so warm.
00:15:39,00:15:40,[LAUGHTER]
00:15:40,00:15:43,"I really think that if I was allowed to commit sodomy,"
00:15:43,00:15:44,I'd be much cooler.
00:15:44,00:15:47,And if instead it may be a cold bar.
00:15:47,00:15:50,"That is an amazing, amazing phrase."
00:15:50,00:15:52,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:15:52,00:16:01,"OK, let's move on to fact number three, which is you, James."
00:16:01,00:16:04,"A hundred years ago, a quarter of the residents of New York"
00:16:04,00:16:09,would move house every single May the 1st at exactly 9 a.m.
00:16:09,00:16:11,That's extraordinary.
00:16:11,00:16:12,Why?
00:16:12,00:16:13,I read this the other day.
00:16:13,00:16:15,"I can't remember where I came across it,"
00:16:15,00:16:17,but I was just astonished that I hadn't heard it before.
00:16:17,00:16:20,It's just like the kind of thing that I would have come across.
00:16:20,00:16:23,And what would happen is people who were renting their houses
00:16:23,00:16:26,"would have a one-year lease, and all the leases"
00:16:26,00:16:27,would end on the same day.
00:16:27,00:16:29,And the landlords would up the rent so much
00:16:29,00:16:31,that they needed to find a better deal.
00:16:31,00:16:34,"And everyone would do this, and everyone would move."
00:16:34,00:16:36,And it was absolute pandemonium.
00:16:36,00:16:38,You're so chaos.
00:16:38,00:16:39,"Oh, I'm surprising."
00:16:39,00:16:39,Yeah.
00:16:39,00:16:41,It sounds terrible system.
00:16:41,00:16:42,I bet it is.
00:16:42,00:16:43,When did that go up to?
00:16:43,00:16:46,"That was until the 1940s, I think."
00:16:46,00:16:50,"But I mean, it was more common in the late 19th century,"
00:16:50,00:16:51,and early 20th century.
00:16:51,00:16:54,That is such a bad idea.
00:16:54,00:16:57,"I know, because moving is the most stressful thing you can do."
00:16:57,00:16:59,What if you were doing it at the same time
00:16:59,00:17:01,as a quarter of all residents of your city?
00:17:01,00:17:02,Goodness.
00:17:02,00:17:04,Maybe it's not that there's something moral-supporty about it.
00:17:04,00:17:06,"And you know, you come out of the street and it's like,"
00:17:06,00:17:08,"oh, yeah, it's same for you, hey?"
00:17:08,00:17:10,"A bit like the blitz spirit kind of, right?"
00:17:10,00:17:11,Exactly.
00:17:11,00:17:15,And something that I read about it was that the big kind
00:17:15,00:17:18,"of important people, suddenly of the city,"
00:17:18,00:17:21,"were the Cartman, the people who drove the car--"
00:17:21,00:17:22,who suddenly were treated with respect
00:17:22,00:17:24,that they'd never seen before.
00:17:24,00:17:29,"People would be bowing to them, calling them Mr. Cartman."
00:17:29,00:17:31,And Trista Cartman.
00:17:31,00:17:33,"So whatever your name is, Cartman."
00:17:33,00:17:34,"It's great, guys."
00:17:34,00:17:35,"It's great, guys."
00:17:35,00:17:39,You're not going too long.
00:17:39,00:17:43,Though it's Anthony Troop's mother wrote about it.
00:17:43,00:17:46,And I just want to quickly read out this little passage.
00:17:46,00:17:49,"She said, on the 1st of May, the city of New York"
00:17:49,00:17:52,has the appearance of sending off a population flying
00:17:52,00:17:54,"from the plague, or a town which has"
00:17:54,00:17:56,surrendered on condition of carrying away
00:17:56,00:17:58,all the goods and chattels.
00:17:58,00:18:00,"Everyone I spoke to on the subject,"
00:18:00,00:18:03,"complained of this custom, as most annoying."
00:18:03,00:18:05,"But all assured me, it was unavoidable."
00:18:05,00:18:07,And what I love about this is it's something which
00:18:07,00:18:10,"is completely, obviously, impractical."
00:18:10,00:18:11,But people still didn't.
00:18:11,00:18:13,"And just thought, oh, well, this is obviously the only way."
00:18:13,00:18:14,We're just going to have to put up with it.
00:18:14,00:18:16,And I think that's happened quite a few times in history.
00:18:16,00:18:17,I think it's quite cool.
00:18:17,00:18:19,"In India, at the moment, they're trying"
00:18:19,00:18:24,to change the time by shifting this certain area of India
00:18:24,00:18:25,by 30 minutes forward.
00:18:25,00:18:29,They would save 2.7 billion units of electricity every year.
00:18:29,00:18:31,And that's the reason they want to do it.
00:18:31,00:18:33,But everyone's petrified of it because they're saying
00:18:33,00:18:34,it's going to cause chaos.
00:18:34,00:18:37,And it just made me think that they like savings
00:18:37,00:18:40,as a thing that we all just do it.
00:18:40,00:18:42,"We just say, OK, the time has changed."
00:18:42,00:18:43,That's fine.
00:18:43,00:18:45,"I mean, maybe in the future, that will be--"
00:18:45,00:18:46,"They'll just look at it and go, yeah."
00:18:46,00:18:47,These guys were idiots.
00:18:47,00:18:50,Remember when they wanted to work out
00:18:50,00:18:54,where the zero-longitude it was?
00:18:54,00:18:56,And it goes through credit now.
00:18:56,00:18:58,So we call it GMT.
00:18:58,00:19:00,"But at the same time, the French wanted to put it"
00:19:00,00:19:02,"through Paris, which means if we'd"
00:19:02,00:19:05,"have done that, it would have been called PMT."
00:19:05,00:19:08,You were telling me a fact about this whole thing
00:19:08,00:19:10,of chaotic movement.
00:19:10,00:19:12,And it was to do with the swapping of--
00:19:12,00:19:14,"So yeah, this was in Sweden."
00:19:14,00:19:15,I can't remember what year it was.
00:19:15,00:19:17,But they always drove on the left-hand side.
00:19:17,00:19:19,And they decided to drive on the right-hand side.
00:19:19,00:19:22,And they decided to do it all at one time.
00:19:22,00:19:24,So everyone would drive on the left.
00:19:24,00:19:25,"And then all of a sudden, they would all"
00:19:25,00:19:28,decide to drive on the right at a certain time.
00:19:28,00:19:29,It's amazing.
00:19:29,00:19:29,I know.
00:19:29,00:19:30,Do you want to phase it in gradually?
00:19:30,00:19:32,"No, no."
00:19:32,00:19:33,Defend.
00:19:33,00:19:34,So what happened once?
00:19:34,00:19:38,Everyone would drive on the left until 450.
00:19:38,00:19:40,And then come to a complete stop.
00:19:40,00:19:43,No one was allowed to drive for 10 minutes.
00:19:43,00:19:44,And then everyone would carefully
00:19:44,00:19:46,move to the right-hand side of the road
00:19:46,00:19:47,and start driving again.
00:19:47,00:19:50,And we weren't allowed to start again until 5.
00:19:50,00:19:51,What did that go?
00:19:51,00:19:53,Can you imagine if you were the only person in the country
00:19:53,00:19:55,who hadn't got the memo?
00:19:55,00:19:57,What's going on?
00:19:57,00:19:58,That was brilliant.
00:19:58,00:20:00,It was kind of what did it work?
00:20:00,00:20:02,"Well, weirdly, it did."
00:20:02,00:20:05,"And there's lots of pictures that it looks a bit like chaotic,"
00:20:05,00:20:06,but it was called--
00:20:06,00:20:07,"I'm going to get this wrong, I'm sure--"
00:20:07,00:20:10,"but it's something like, ""Hurka Traffic on Lagmingland,"""
00:20:10,00:20:14,"or they call it ""Dagon H,"" which means the ""H"" day."
00:20:14,00:20:17,"And on that day, there were only 125"
00:20:17,00:20:18,reparted traffic accidents.
00:20:18,00:20:23,"But on a normal Monday, there would be between 130 and 198."
00:20:23,00:20:24,And there were no fatalities.
00:20:24,00:20:27,"So actually, it was a safer day than normal."
00:20:27,00:20:30,So we should switch sides of the road every single day
00:20:30,00:20:31,to keep the utilities down.
00:20:31,00:20:33,So we've got a moral duty to do that.
00:20:33,00:20:34,Absolutely.
00:20:34,00:20:36,You want to put it really into the deal.
00:20:36,00:20:37,But you would be more careful.
00:20:37,00:20:40,It's like the idea of some innovator
00:20:40,00:20:42,has come up with the spike in the middle of the steering
00:20:42,00:20:46,"wheel, which is pointing directly at your heart,"
00:20:46,00:20:49,which would make us all drive very carefully.
00:20:49,00:20:52,"The spike them down at least, yeah."
00:20:52,00:20:54,I think that's a brilliant idea.
00:20:54,00:20:55,"Don't get an airbag, get a spike."
00:20:55,00:20:57,"Yes, you really want to be safe."
00:20:57,00:20:59,"There would be a lot fewer people hit by cars,"
00:20:59,00:21:01,but a lot more people driving cars would die.
00:21:01,00:21:04,You're not a spike related to Jews.
00:21:04,00:21:06,Another spike I'm afraid of you.
00:21:06,00:21:08,"Well, I think we can make this a quick autopsy, can we?"
00:21:08,00:21:09,Yeah.
00:21:09,00:21:12,That wasn't tragically impaled.
00:21:12,00:21:14,Why is he pionned?
00:21:14,00:21:17,"tragically impaled, because he couldn't get the right clutch."
00:21:17,00:21:23,He just followed it and he had another seat adjustment accident.
00:21:23,00:21:26,"And there's another, even more complicated theory,"
00:21:26,00:21:28,that actually it wouldn't affect the number of statistics
00:21:28,00:21:31,"we have, because people always drive at the very edge"
00:21:31,00:21:32,of safety.
00:21:32,00:21:35,"There was a study done on this, I can't remember all the details,"
00:21:35,00:21:36,but there was a study done.
00:21:36,00:21:38,And it was a level crossing.
00:21:38,00:21:41,And they measured how quickly people were driving.
00:21:41,00:21:44,"And it was just about the safest they could do,"
00:21:44,00:21:47,"and slam on it, and still not hit the train."
00:21:47,00:21:50,And then they put a hedge in front of the level crossing.
00:21:50,00:21:52,So you wouldn't be able to see it until a bit later.
00:21:52,00:21:54,"And they found that people slowed down,"
00:21:54,00:21:57,but only to the extent that they would have to slam on
00:21:57,00:21:59,and just amount of them is a trade.
00:21:59,00:21:59,Wow.
00:21:59,00:22:00,Risk takers.
00:22:00,00:22:02,So going back to the obviously impractical.
00:22:02,00:22:05,"In Micronesia, they had these maps."
00:22:05,00:22:09,And the maps were made of sticks and made of rope.
00:22:09,00:22:12,"And the maps would be related to the waves,"
00:22:12,00:22:14,because waves change when they go past islands.
00:22:14,00:22:18,"And so you would look at your map and look at the waves,"
00:22:18,00:22:20,and you'd be able to tell which way to go.
00:22:20,00:22:23,"Now, the waves are not very easy to see."
00:22:23,00:22:25,"If so, you have to somehow detect the waves."
00:22:25,00:22:27,And the best way that they found to do it
00:22:27,00:22:30,"was to put the most sensitive part of your body into the sea,"
00:22:30,00:22:32,which was your testicles.
00:22:32,00:22:34,So they would dip their testicles into the ocean
00:22:34,00:22:35,and measure the waves.
00:22:35,00:22:37,And then they would look at their map
00:22:37,00:22:39,and decide which way to go to get to the next island.
00:22:39,00:22:41,"The thing is, I just like the fact that,"
00:22:41,00:22:43,"I mean, dipping your testicles in the water"
00:22:43,00:22:47,and looking at them up is a completely impractical way.
00:22:47,00:22:50,"They just thought, well, that's the best way we have,"
00:22:50,00:22:51,which we're just going to do it.
00:22:51,00:22:52,"It's just as well that you don't have to do it today,"
00:22:52,00:22:53,isn't it?
00:22:53,00:22:53,Excuse me.
00:22:53,00:22:55,"Sorry, do you know the way to the swimming pool?"
00:22:55,00:22:57,"Yeah, they had one second."
00:22:57,00:22:58,Got my beaker.
00:22:58,00:23:00,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:00,00:23:10,"OK, let's move on to our final fact of the show."
00:23:10,00:23:11,"Andy, this is your one."
00:23:11,00:23:16,"OK, this is that nobody knows why we kiss."
00:23:16,00:23:17,Is that you and I on?
00:23:17,00:23:20,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:20,00:23:23,"Especially not your life, oh my god, for God's sake."
00:23:23,00:23:25,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:25,00:23:28,There are a couple of theories as to why humans
00:23:28,00:23:31,"kiss each other, as opposed to just for pleasure,"
00:23:31,00:23:33,but all because it feels good.
00:23:33,00:23:37,But it's not clear with the answer one way or the other.
00:23:37,00:23:41,"Basically, it's between whether we instinctively do it"
00:23:41,00:23:43,or whether it's learned behavior.
00:23:43,00:23:47,"Well, I remember reading that actually it's not historically"
00:23:47,00:23:49,"that all cultures kiss, is it?"
00:23:49,00:23:51,So that would imply that it's not--
00:23:51,00:23:53,It's not instinctive to hear it.
00:23:53,00:23:54,"It's happy, is it?"
00:23:54,00:23:56,I think the theory is to it being instinctual
00:23:56,00:24:00,is that mothers would mash up food in their mouths.
00:24:00,00:24:02,"They would chew the food themselves, and they'd transfer it"
00:24:02,00:24:04,into their infant's mouth.
00:24:04,00:24:06,And so all we're really trying to do when we kiss each other
00:24:06,00:24:10,is recreate the nice feeling of one's mother regurgitating
00:24:10,00:24:12,food into your mouth.
00:24:12,00:24:12,So we all love that.
00:24:12,00:24:13,Certainly why I do it.
00:24:13,00:24:15,[LAUGHTER]
00:24:15,00:24:19,I read that it was the kind of the global spread of kissing
00:24:19,00:24:21,as a common thing was done by the Romans.
00:24:21,00:24:22,I really did.
00:24:22,00:24:24,"They were a vibrant kissing culture, apparently."
00:24:24,00:24:26,And they maybe brought it in from India.
00:24:26,00:24:27,Have you read that bit?
00:24:27,00:24:30,"No, but the weird sentence I read is that they did it"
00:24:30,00:24:31,via military conquest.
00:24:31,00:24:35,So it was actually through war that kissing became a--
00:24:35,00:24:39,"Well, there's much less right now."
00:24:39,00:24:41,I read about one culture that doesn't kiss.
00:24:41,00:24:43,"These are the people of Mangaya, which"
00:24:43,00:24:45,is an island in the Cook Islands.
00:24:45,00:24:49,And it's written about them that they don't kiss at all.
00:24:49,00:24:51,But the way they make up for it is they
00:24:51,00:24:54,are one of the most sexually active groups of people
00:24:54,00:24:55,in the world.
00:24:55,00:24:57,And I'm going to quote this.
00:24:57,00:25:01,"At 28 years of age, they average two orgasms"
00:25:01,00:25:04,"per night, five to six times a week."
00:25:04,00:25:07,The expectation is that the male will strive to have his partner
00:25:07,00:25:09,have two or three orgasms to his one.
00:25:09,00:25:11,"So basically, they're the most orgasmic people,"
00:25:11,00:25:12,but they don't kiss.
00:25:12,00:25:14,Or they're the most compulsive liars in the world.
00:25:14,00:25:17,[LAUGHTER]
00:25:17,00:25:19,I just find you amazing braggers.
00:25:19,00:25:20,Yeah.
00:25:20,00:25:23,"And like eight orgasms last night, I don't know how do you?"
00:25:23,00:25:28,"I've gone for another three times as many, so nonsense."
00:25:28,00:25:31,There is a thought that-- I think Kato the elder said this--
00:25:31,00:25:33,"yes, the Romans did like to kiss."
00:25:33,00:25:35,But there's a theory that Romans kiss their wives
00:25:35,00:25:37,to check whether or not they've been drinking.
00:25:37,00:25:39,And Kato wrote that her husband was considered
00:25:39,00:25:40,to be acting within his legal right
00:25:40,00:25:43,if he killed his wife after catching her drinking
00:25:43,00:25:44,or with alcohol on her breath.
00:25:44,00:25:45,That's true.
00:25:45,00:25:47,Did you guys read that it's only this year
00:25:47,00:25:50,the 2014 edition of the French Dictionary
00:25:50,00:25:54,that French kissing is now a word in France?
00:25:54,00:25:55,This is the word--
00:25:55,00:25:55,Galache.
00:25:55,00:25:56,Galache.
00:25:56,00:25:59,La galache is an ice skating boot.
00:25:59,00:26:02,And so the new term is the idea of tongues slipping on ice.
00:26:02,00:26:03,Slipping on ice.
00:26:03,00:26:05,"Yeah, like an ice skating boot."
00:26:05,00:26:08,They're not as romantic as we have given them credit for.
00:26:08,00:26:10,"They did a lot of slipping on ice, wasn't they?"
00:26:10,00:26:11,Every year.
00:26:11,00:26:14,I use the official word categorism.
00:26:14,00:26:15,Yeah.
00:26:15,00:26:17,That's why you do so well.
00:26:17,00:26:19,"There's a book called ""The Science of Kissing"""
00:26:19,00:26:22,"by Cheryl Kieschenbaum, which I've really enjoyed."
00:26:22,00:26:24,"I've read a lot all of it, but some of it."
00:26:24,00:26:26,The author says that 90% of people
00:26:26,00:26:28,can remember that their first kiss
00:26:28,00:26:29,better than the first time they had sex.
00:26:29,00:26:32,Is that to do with drunkenness or--
00:26:32,00:26:33,I don't--
00:26:33,00:26:35,I don't think that's a very--
00:26:35,00:26:36,Usually you're fun.
00:26:36,00:26:39,"Yeah, better than--"
00:26:39,00:26:42,Do you guys know the first video footage of a kiss?
00:26:42,00:26:44,It was actually one of the first films ever
00:26:44,00:26:45,shown to the public.
00:26:45,00:26:46,And it was a couple kissing.
00:26:46,00:26:48,And it was from a scene which
00:26:48,00:26:51,"was in a play called ""The Widow Jones."""
00:26:51,00:26:52,And you can see the video online.
00:26:52,00:26:54,It was filmed by the Edison company.
00:26:54,00:26:55,"The quote they gave around it was,"
00:26:55,00:26:59,"they get ready to kiss, begin to kiss, and kiss and kiss"
00:26:59,00:27:01,in a way that brings down the house every time.
00:27:01,00:27:02,"That was in the description, yeah."
00:27:02,00:27:05,And so we'll put out on qi.com/podcast.
00:27:05,00:27:08,You can see the very first recorded video kiss.
00:27:08,00:27:11,I think you're going to mention the first film
00:27:11,00:27:13,to win Best Picture.
00:27:13,00:27:14,"This was called ""Wings,"" I think."
00:27:14,00:27:16,"Going off memory, but Andy's nodding."
00:27:16,00:27:17,"So I think he might be right, but there"
00:27:17,00:27:20,is a man-on-man kiss.
00:27:20,00:27:20,"Yes, there is."
00:27:20,00:27:24,It's two soldiers or aviators in the festival.
00:27:24,00:27:25,"Yeah, yeah."
00:27:25,00:27:26,But we were saying about the Widow Jones
00:27:26,00:27:27,the first cinematic kiss.
00:27:27,00:27:30,I just wanted to quickly mention the review
00:27:30,00:27:33,that it was given by a painter called John Sloan.
00:27:33,00:27:37,This is also possibly the first film review ever.
00:27:37,00:27:38,This is in 1896.
00:27:38,00:27:42,He said the kiss is absolutely disgusting.
00:27:42,00:27:43,Neither participant is physically attractive.
00:27:43,00:27:45,And the spectacle of their prolonged past
00:27:45,00:27:48,during on each other's lips was hard to bear.
00:27:48,00:27:51,"When only life-sized, it was pronounced beastly,"
00:27:51,00:27:53,magnifying to go a gancho in proportions.
00:27:53,00:27:55,It is absolutely disgusting.
00:27:55,00:27:57,Such things call for police interference.
00:27:57,00:27:59,[LAUGHTER]
00:27:59,00:28:00,That's amazing.
00:28:00,00:28:02,Allegedly the first ever film review.
00:28:02,00:28:03,Police interference.
00:28:03,00:28:04,Call the police.
00:28:04,00:28:05,Shut it down.
00:28:05,00:28:07,He just got out of a difficult relationship.
00:28:07,00:28:08,Yeah.
00:28:08,00:28:10,"But if you watch the video as well, it's hilarious"
00:28:10,00:28:12,because they're basically spend half the clip
00:28:12,00:28:14,with their mouth to each other.
00:28:14,00:28:15,But they're just chatting to each other.
00:28:15,00:28:15,Yeah.
00:28:15,00:28:17,"That's not that really close, huh?"
00:28:17,00:28:19,"Literally, their mouth's going, oh, yeah, you got it."
00:28:19,00:28:22,"They're talking into each other's mouths almost, yeah."
00:28:22,00:28:25,"Obviously, a lot of cultures have a different way"
00:28:25,00:28:26,of greeting kissing.
00:28:26,00:28:28,"You know, the French will kiss on both cheeks."
00:28:28,00:28:29,It's always a confusion.
00:28:29,00:28:30,You don't know how many times you're kissing.
00:28:30,00:28:32,"For politicians, it's a big problem,"
00:28:32,00:28:34,particularly when they're meeting heads of states
00:28:34,00:28:37,"who, particularly, they shouldn't be seen as having"
00:28:37,00:28:39,an intimate moment with.
00:28:39,00:28:42,And I learned that Bill Clinton when he was introduced
00:28:42,00:28:45,"to Yes Arafat, because Yes Arafat's a big hugger."
00:28:45,00:28:48,And there's a period where he couldn't just couldn't get a hug
00:28:48,00:28:50,"from Yes Arafat, so he had to avoid it."
00:28:50,00:28:53,And the way that he avoided it was that his aides
00:28:53,00:28:57,"taught him jujitsu, so he could call specific moves on Arafat"
00:28:57,00:28:58,whenever he went in for a hug.
00:28:58,00:29:00,"Look, through him over his shoulder."
00:29:00,00:29:01,"If you watch some of the footage,"
00:29:01,00:29:05,you'll notice that Arafat suddenly get flipped to the ground.
00:29:05,00:29:08,"No, but so Clinton was actively taught jujitsu"
00:29:08,00:29:10,in order to avoid the Arafat hug.
00:29:10,00:29:12,"Arafat finally got a hug on him, though, at one point."
00:29:12,00:29:14,There's a photo that you can see there.
