00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,280
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,400
 - Hey, Club Fish members.

3
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,840
 Welcome to this week's bonus bit of content.

4
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,140
 We have got a compilation episode for you today.

5
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,280
 But before we get into it,

6
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,960
 I just wanna quickly remind some of you

7
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,440
 who may have missed the news

8
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,220
 that we are going to do a live show,

9
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,920
 July 6th at the Crossed Wires Festival,

10
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,460
 which is a festival that was co-created

11
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,680
 by our good friend Alice Levine of My Dad Wrote a Porno.

12
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,280
 They started last year, it was a massive success.

13
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,320
 They're coming back this year

14
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,960
 and we were really excited to be invited,

15
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,960
 so we're gonna be doing a live recording.

16
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,360
 Now, we didn't do Sheffield on our tour last year.

17
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,720
 We really missed out on getting to that bit of the country.

18
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,320
 So if you're in that area, come along.

19
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,040
 We're doing a full live recording.

20
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,520
 There'll be a few extra fun bits thrown in as well.

21
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,680
 And if you wanna get tickets,

22
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,840
 go to nosuchthingasafish.com.

23
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,200
 You'll find all the links there.

24
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,120
 And why not check out what other podcasts are on.

25
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,440
 It is genuinely a great pod festival.

26
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,320
 All right, well, let's get to the compilation.

27
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,960
 Here are the best of the outtakes

28
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,600
 that never made it to the main show.

29
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,440
 Here we go.

30
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,140
 (upbeat music)

31
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:14,560
 - She had been told the gaitnesses.

32
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,400
 She turned up to the unveiling of the Statue of Liberty.

33
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,240
 - Oh yeah.

34
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,080
 - Which I really liked.

35
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,960
 She turned that she was not invited.

36
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,080
 But she turned up on a cattle barge.

37
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,360
 So she turned up on a barge with a megaphone,

38
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,120
 shouting that it was a gigantic lie,

39
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,920
 a travesty and a mockery

40
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,240
 to make the representation of Liberty a woman

41
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,440
 when actual women had so few rights at the time.

42
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,840
 So that was her, that was her prototype.

43
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,560
 - She's shackled though, isn't she?

44
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,360
 - Oh, is she broken her shackles?

45
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,560
 - I don't think she's shackled.

46
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,400
 - Is she not?

47
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,600
 - I should know, I've been up it.

48
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,440
 And I don't know.

49
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,160
 - Yeah, but that's what you're on the inside.

50
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,400
 You can't see me outside, can you, from there?

51
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,560
 - Oh, and I haven't been up it either.

52
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,000
 Sorry, I was missing one.

53
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,080
 What just happened?

54
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,120
 I've been near it.

55
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,000
 - Oh yeah, we all bit, we went together.

56
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,880
 We were near it when we went to do yard.

57
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,720
 - I've been closer than that.

58
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,560
 - I love you.

59
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,960
 - Yeah, yeah, but she's not, I don't think she,

60
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,800
 I'm pretty sure she's not shackled.

61
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,640
 - I don't think she's shackled.

62
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,080
 - I thought one of her legs had a shackle on it,

63
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,960
 but maybe I'm wrong.

64
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,800
 - She's got slippers that I know that much.

65
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,640
 - Slippers.

66
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,800
 - I think they're more sandals.

67
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,920
 - Yeah, slip-ons, like the open toad.

68
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,240
 You could see her feet.

69
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,080
 - Yeah.

70
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,920
 - She's a woman in comfortable shoes.

71
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,760
 - While you stayed outside,

72
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,400
 you got one of those wiki feet things going on.

73
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,640
 (laughing)

74
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,200
 - So, true feminists should campaign

75
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,400
 for the Statue of Liberty to be a man?

76
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,440
 - Yeah, and yet, and yet my campaign has done nothing.

77
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,840
 (laughing)

78
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,880
 - I have one more caddy called Daft Willy Gunn.

79
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,840
 He is an old school one in Scotland.

80
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,480
 He was from the 19th century, early 19th century.

81
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,000
 He always wore four coats, three or four pairs of trousers.

82
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,040
 - It is cold in Scotland.

83
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,200
 - It is cold.

84
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,240
 He couldn't afford like a big coat or anything,

85
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,280
 so he just wore like lots of small ones.

86
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,720
 - To false economy.

87
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,520
 (laughing)

88
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,960
 Spend the money on a good coat.

89
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,360
 - He would only eat milk and soft bread rolls his whole life.

90
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,280
 And he would be in St Andrews in Scotland.

91
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,000
 And then when the golf season finished,

92
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,400
 he would walk off and no one knew where he went.

93
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,280
 He just presumably walked home somewhere.

94
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,960
 And then when the season started, he walked back again.

95
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,800
 And that was it.

96
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,520
 - He's a really great train.

97
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,000
 - And then one day, they stumbled upon a grave,

98
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,760
 which said he died in 1522.

99
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,000
 (laughing)

100
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,760
 - Well, one day in 1820, he walked north, never to return.

101
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,520
 And to this day, nobody knows what happened to him.

102
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,360
 - He's still out there.

103
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,680
 - That's great.

104
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,520
 - Do you know that fact?

105
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,840
 Have I ever said it on this?

106
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,720
 I don't think I have.

107
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,080
 It was during the Winter War, I think,

108
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,560
 between Russia and Finland.

109
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,840
 And there was a guy who was captured.

110
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,760
 And it turned out that he was trying to hide in the snow

111
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,560
 by putting doilies on his head.

112
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,800
 (laughing)

113
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,440
 And he reckoned it worked for ages

114
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,160
 because they were white doilies and no one could see him.

115
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,440
 - But why had he taken so many doilies to a comfort zone?

116
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,960
 I said, did he just think,

117
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,320
 I know this is gonna work.

118
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,000
 - I think he might have plundered them from houses.

119
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,840
 - Really, of course, 'cause you would get doilies.

120
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,160
 I mean, you don't get doilies anymore.

121
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,840
 It's a really, really sad fact.

122
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,200
 I mean, you get sort of weak doilies on trains these days,

123
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,760
 but even then only on nice trains, they're not very good.

124
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,440
 - Let's make me think if you're Jewish

125
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,320
 and you have a Yamaha,

126
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,000
 do you, if you were going certain places with the army,

127
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,200
 would you match it to your environment?

128
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,000
 You're going somewhere winter, where are white?

129
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,360
 - Like a Kamoka.

130
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,680
 (laughing)

131
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,000
 - But in all these scenarios,

132
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,040
 and in this one that you've described,

133
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,480
 you didn't really have to bury yourself up to the eyebrows.

134
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,800
 - I think it was more like his hair

135
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,480
 would show up against the snow,

136
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,880
 but you maybe had a white coat.

137
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,280
 - Did he get caught when some Russians turned up

138
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,760
 and thought, oh, a lovely comfy armchair.

139
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,680
 I'll just put my left arm here.

140
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,160
 - He doesn't put like double T on that.

141
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,240
 (laughing)

142
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,240
 - Wait a minute, what's a doily doing here?

143
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,640
 You know what, I only half remembered the story, so.

144
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,520
 - Wait, is a doily's for your head, isn't it?

145
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,880
 Is it a coaster?

146
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,320
 - No, a doily is the thing you put on a table

147
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,040
 and you put, it's a bit bigger than a coaster,

148
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,280
 but you put your tea pot on it.

149
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,120
 - What am I thinking of here?

150
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,880
 - I think-- - I'm lazy.

151
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,280
 - An anti-McCassar. - An anti-McCassar.

152
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,200
 - I'm so sorry. - I think I'm an anti-McCassar.

153
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,840
 - An anti-McCassar is the thing you don't get anymore.

154
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,240
 I've got doily's coming out of my arse.

155
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,120
 (laughing)

156
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,600
 - It's weird that they're the same material though,

157
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,440
 so you obviously it was material-based confusion.

158
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,280
 Anyway. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

159
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,000
 - I don't think a doily would work as an anti-McCassar

160
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,960
 'cause it's got holes in it,

161
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,960
 so all the MacCassar juice would get on the chair.

162
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,800
 - You're right.

163
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,800
 - What's a MacCassar?

164
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,160
 - So MacCassar is like-- - Oh, God.

165
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,560
 - We have gone off topic, haven't we?

166
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,000
 - MacCassar is hair oil that in the 19th century,

167
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,600
 you'd have lots of, you'd slather yourself.

168
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,560
 - Yeah, yeah. - You'd make memory.

169
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,400
 So that's why the anti--

170
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,360
 - We don't need to combine this in the 19th century.

171
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,840
 - Sorry, you popped your tiger balm in your hair.

172
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,200
 Your anti-McCassar is when you go on the train

173
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,480
 or at a chair, you sit in a comfy chair,

174
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,000
 you need a layer of cloth between your head

175
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,960
 and the fabric of the chair

176
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,480
 so that the oil doesn't soak into the chair itself.

177
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,920
 So that's an anti-McCassar.

178
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,480
 James is right, a doily is the kind of coaster.

179
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,960
 - Is that what they put on airplanes when you say--

180
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,120
 - Yeah, anti-McCassar. - That's an anti-McCassar.

181
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,880
 - Should we talk about L Frank Baum? - Yeah, sure.

182
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,680
 - I've only got anti-McCassar material.

183
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,120
 Do you know how scientists,

184
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,720
 if they've got a healer monster to test its health levels,

185
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,800
 how they test them?

186
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,360
 - Okay, so I'm gonna give you a clue.

187
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,760
 - Tremel is classic.

188
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,600
 - Nice, that's good.

189
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,240
 It's actually not to test how fit they are in a gym sense.

190
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,320
 It's more like how many reserves do they have?

191
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,640
 How long do they get to last in the desert?

192
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,920
 - Tales of conference, 'cause that's where they keep their friends.

193
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,120
 It's related to Archimedes.

194
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,200
 - They put it in a bath and how much water comes out.

195
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,040
 - It's exactly it.

196
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,160
 They dunk their tail in a cup of water

197
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,600
 and then you just measure how much comes out

198
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,040
 and then you know how fat the tail is.

199
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,320
 - It was a bit of an easy clue.

200
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,440
 I'll have to, sorry about that.

201
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,840
 But you know, I didn't want it to go on forever.

202
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,720
 It was gonna be a fun game, was it?

203
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,280
 - So they are venomous, right?

204
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,200
 And I think only two people are recorded

205
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,480
 to have ever died, one last year and one in 1930.

206
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,840
 And, but the reason they're not very dangerous

207
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,400
 is that they don't have a mechanism to inject their venom.

208
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,480
 What they've got is they've got teeth with grooves in

209
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,400
 and they have to bite into you

210
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,680
 and then just chew up and down and up and down

211
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,560
 and up and down and flood their mouth with venom

212
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,520
 and chew the venom into you.

213
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,160
 So it's quite hard for them to have a victim.

214
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,120
 So they've got, it's very inefficient.

215
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,080
 - I read it takes like 15 minutes.

216
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,000
 - Well, the guy who died last year,

217
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,400
 he'd been bitten for four minutes.

218
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,840
 - Yeah, there was a suggestion

219
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,960
 that you might have had an allergic reaction.

220
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,800
 - Interesting.

221
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,760
 - Yeah, it can be quite scary, I think.

222
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,520
 There was a 1959 movie called The Giant Healer Monster,

223
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:09,200
 which apparently features a Mexican bearded lizard

224
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,800
 instead of a healer monster.

225
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,040
 - You wouldn't get away with that these days.

226
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,040
 - Beard, no, exactly.

227
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:18,000
 You have to skin an actual healer monster, don't you?

228
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,800
 But it was the first ever double feature film

229
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,600
 where you paid for one film and you got two.

230
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,680
 - Oh, right, that's great.

231
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,720
 - And it was the first ever film

232
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,520
 that was shot and produced in Dallas.

233
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,280
 - Really? - Wow.

234
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,440
 - But the double feature that you got

235
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,200
 was the giant healer monster.

236
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,120
 And the other one was called The Killer Shrews.

237
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,080
 - Oh, wow.

238
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,400
 Which one, headlines?

239
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,040
 - I mean, it's gotta be a double headline now.

240
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,520
 - It is a double headline.

241
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,440
 Yeah, I watched the trailer for the Healer Monster movie.

242
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,760
 It's wild, it's wonderful.

243
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,600
 Actually, I lie, I watched it for the remake in 2012,

244
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,320
 simply called Healer with an exclamation mark.

245
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,280
 - Yeah, it's unbelievable these things get remade.

246
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,160
 It was at the time acknowledged as an unbelievably bad film.

247
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,280
 Who's remaking it?

248
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,600
 - So what, and it's as bad?

249
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,360
 - Did they not remake The Killer Shrews?

250
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,920
 - Oh, I didn't check that, I should have.

251
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,280
 - It's in development help, yeah, yeah.

252
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,880
 - Just on strong materials.

253
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,920
 This is the stiffest material.

254
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,840
 It's all about the hardest.

255
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,000
 There's also the strongest,

256
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,040
 and that's like how much can you hang off something,

257
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,960
 basically.

258
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,760
 Strongest natural material, thought for ages and ages.

259
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,600
 - Spider silk?

260
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,280
 - Spider silk, spider silk.

261
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,120
 - Wow.

262
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:33,120
 - I can just imagine Anna as the host of University Challenge.

263
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,000
 Someone gets an answer like, "Oh, wow, isn't it?

264
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,120
 "The Chilling Milton, oh."

265
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,320
 - Well, I've always been so skeptical about this,

266
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,640
 and I know scientists have always claimed it,

267
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,320
 but I've just passed so many spiders webs,

268
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,080
 and often I pull at them and they break.

269
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,440
 - You're unbelievably strong, Anna.

270
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,440
 - I am, I am.

271
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,280
 - You're like Godzilla.

272
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,120
 - I'm Hercules, yes.

273
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,080
 - Friend of the flies, Anna Tijinski.

274
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,800
 - I liberate them.

275
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,040
 I get it, it's pound for pound, they're very thin,

276
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,600
 but it seems so unlikely.

277
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,920
 And anyway, they've been supplanted recently,

278
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,720
 and I believe this much more.

279
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,200
 - They always say ants are really strong,

280
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,760
 but I just stand on them and they're fucking squished.

281
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,480
 - It's like I don't understand proportionality.

282
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,040
 Anyway, it was recently found

283
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,200
 that the strongest material is limpid teeth.

284
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,720
 So you know limpids, like the common limpid

285
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,520
 that you see on beaches?

286
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,040
 Their teeth, they're actually on their tongue,

287
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,440
 like we were talking about a bit earlier with mollusks.

288
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,720
 They've got this tongue,

289
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,440
 and they use it for the same purpose as parrotfish,

290
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,480
 which is just a scrape algae off the rocks.

291
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,960
 And apparently the comparison

292
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,680
 is a single string of spaghetti holding,

293
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,000
 the scientists said 3,500 kilogram bags of sugar,

294
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,400
 which I didn't think was that good a comparison.

295
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:45,440
 So I'm deciding to say it's like a string of spaghetti

296
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,800
 holding a large walrus,

297
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,320
 or my car with five adults inside, if you know my car.

298
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,160
 - Wow.

299
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,000
 - I know your car.

300
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,840
 - Yeah, I know your car.

301
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,680
 - They imagine that with five adults.

302
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,520
 - It's not like the small,

303
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,880
 it's a normal, small-ish size car, right?

304
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,720
 - It's a sco de fab, yeah.

305
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,560
 - Yeah.

306
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,880
 - I'm not ashamed to say it.

307
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,960
 (all laughing)

308
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,800
 - That's amazing.

309
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,040
 - Cut spaghetti?

310
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,840
 - I think it doesn't matter

311
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,160
 'cause it's about the width of it.

312
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,000
 - It doesn't matter.

313
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 - You've been trying this Italian restaurant.

314
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,440
 (all laughing)

315
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,520
 - It's a nightmare.

316
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:17,760
 - It's really hard to turn it around at four,

317
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,600
 'cause of it.

318
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,440
 (all laughing)

319
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,080
 - It's al dente.

320
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,160
 (all laughing)

321
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,400
 - I'll tell you one last,

322
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,960
 this is an alternative actually to a Zempig,

323
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,440
 'cause you know, others are available,

324
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,880
 but much better, Vibes.

325
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,040
 - Oh, okay.

326
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,480
 - Which is an acronym that stands for

327
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,000
 the Vibrating Ingestible Bioelectric Simulator.

328
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,840
 - Okay.

329
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,920
 - And it is a pill that you swallow

330
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,680
 that wiggles and tickles and jiggles inside you

331
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,600
 and makes you think you're full.

332
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,480
 It's called, like, it's a battery,

333
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,040
 a motor, a little vibrating motor,

334
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,440
 and a membrane, and when you swallow it,

335
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,280
 the membrane dissolves.

336
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,080
 - You know what it sounds like to me, Andy?

337
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,320
 - A magic bean, and I've got a lot to sell you.

338
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,840
 (all laughing)

339
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,920
 - And well, it's been tested in the last couple of years,

340
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,600
 in 2023, it's been tested on pigs,

341
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,960
 hasn't got to human trials yet,

342
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,640
 but they ate 40% less.

343
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,320
 - And pigs love to eat, like, they're overweight.

344
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,160
 - They love to eat,

345
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,520
 and it's been tested on young Yorkshire pigs, apparently.

346
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,840
 (all laughing)

347
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,640
 It basically means that your stomach

348
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,680
 has been jiggled around and it thinks,

349
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,000
 oh, there must be loads of food in here.

350
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,840
 - Really?

351
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,680
 - And then, yeah.

352
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,040
 - Wow, but then what do I have to eat

353
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,560
 to get rid of that thing?

354
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,400
 - You just eat another one,

355
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,680
 and then push it the first one through, that's fine.

356
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,800
 - Right, okay, and then just eat a big one and a big one.

357
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,320
 - Wow, what a weird poo that will feel like,

358
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,160
 'cause it's vibrating out your butt.

359
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,800
 (all laughing)

360
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,200
 - Here's an interesting thing,

361
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,240
 avalanches are not nearly as deadly as they used to be,

362
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,080
 and more than half of people who are stuck

363
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,760
 in avalanches survive these days.

364
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,600
 - Wow.

365
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,240
 - Yeah, and they've got loads of new survival devices

366
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,320
 that you can have that if you're skiing off-piste,

367
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,240
 you might have them with you.

368
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,720
 - One of them, which is really cool,

369
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,240
 is a thing called the avalanche airbag system,

370
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,200
 and what you do is when you're skiing

371
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,420
 and you see an avalanche coming,

372
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,240
 you go, oh, shit, and you pull a toggle,

373
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,000
 and it just puts an airbag around you

374
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,640
 like you're in a car, like you're in a sob,

375
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,720
 but it makes you massive.

376
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,160
 It puts this huge airbag around you,

377
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,880
 and can you guess how it works?

378
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,480
 This is really amazing.

379
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,520
 - Is it something to do with pressure up in the mountains?

380
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,120
 Well, how it's inflating?

381
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,880
 - So you know when you get muesli, for instance,

382
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,200
 you get a big box of muesli,

383
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,280
 and at the top are all like the big nuts and stuff,

384
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,400
 but at the bottom are all the little grainy bits

385
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,240
 that you don't really want to eat.

386
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,280
 - Yeah, this effect has got a name, this effect.

387
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,880
 - Yeah, it's called like the Brazil nut effect

388
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,040
 or something like that.

389
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,200
 Well, this makes you really big,

390
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,200
 and so when the avalanche is coming down,

391
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,440
 like a Brazil nut, you float to the top

392
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,640
 and all the small bits of snow go to the bottom.

393
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,480
 - Wow.

394
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,320
 - Isn't that amazing?

395
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,520
 It's called the principle of inverse segregation.

396
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,360
 - Wow.

397
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,400
 - And so it keeps you near the top,

398
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,200
 and it makes you easier to find.

399
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,040
 - And while you're waiting,

400
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,840
 you've got all that muesli to get you to buy.

401
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,400
 (laughing)

402
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,400
 - Have many people done that on purpose?

403
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,680
 'Cause I'd imagine it would be tempting.

404
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,440
 - It's been used in Europe for over 10 years.

405
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,200
 - No, sorry, as in for fun.

406
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,040
 - Oh, for fun?

407
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,880
 - 'Cause you would have thought

408
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,840
 that would be unbelievably good fun.

409
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,200
 - It feels like avalanche chasers

410
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,200
 are gonna be a thing, right?

411
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,840
 Like tornado hunters.

412
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,200
 - Yeah, like surfing on the top of an avalanche

413
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,360
 in your big bubble, how great would that be?

414
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,560
 - I'm gonna say don't try it at home anyway.

415
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,400
 - You can't.

416
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,160
 (laughing)

417
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,880
 - Do you know the most famous frostbite sufferer

418
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,040
 of all time?

419
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,120
 - Randall Fiennes.

420
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,960
 - Yeah, I would have said him.

421
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,840
 - More famous, even more famous than Randall Fiennes.

422
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,000
 - Brian Blessed.

423
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,120
 - Think more famous.

424
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,160
 - Barack Obama.

425
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,000
 - More famous.

426
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,840
 - David Asenborough.

427
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,680
 - God.

428
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,520
 - Albert Einstein.

429
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,360
 - Joey Essex.

430
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,200
 - God.

431
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,040
 - God?

432
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,880
 - There was a study in 2004

433
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,640
 by a couple of neo-intelligence

434
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,760
 who decreed that the baby--

435
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,960
 - Sorry, Joey Essex came at the end.

436
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,800
 (laughing)

437
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,640
 - Just about to think

438
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,120
 of the most famous person I could think of.

439
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,680
 - The study found that the baby Jesus

440
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,000
 almost certainly had hypothermia as a baby.

441
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,760
 - Oh, and then by extension.

442
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,600
 - No?

443
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,440
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

444
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,280
 - Not God, God.

445
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,840
 - Well, now he is one of the three gods

446
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,200
 that's a kid that makes a god.

447
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,040
 - Well, it depends which one you find.

448
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,680
 - Basically, they looked at a load of,

449
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,120
 they looked at a load of old masters paintings

450
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,120
 from the National Gallery,

451
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,400
 which loads of them are feature of--

452
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,560
 - Oh, and of course they were painted life, weren't they?

453
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,640
 (laughing)

454
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,760
 There was like, there was an ox and an ass

455
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,920
 and three shepherds and a load of fucking painters

456
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,360
 in the car, wasn't there?

457
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,200
 - But you never see them.

458
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,920
 It's like a press gallery, you know.

459
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,320
 So yeah, 90% of these paintings depicted Jesus

460
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,760
 as either naked or scantily clad.

461
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,200
 And given that the temperature in Bethlehem

462
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,440
 in late December is about seven Celsius,

463
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,720
 like, and 60% of the paintings, he's on the floor.

464
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,920
 You think, why have you put the baby on the floor?

465
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,760
 Don't put the baby on the floor.

466
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,320
 - He wasn't born on Christmas Day though.

467
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,720
 I know that according to the rules he was,

468
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,120
 but I think we don't think he was.

469
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,000
 - No, okay, but either way, it's clearly a risk.

470
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,240
 And they said that the,

471
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,000
 can you guess the explanation they provided?

472
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,440
 I really like this as to why it might have been all right.

473
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,280
 'Cause he was God.

474
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,680
 - Why he survived it.

475
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,720
 - Maybe the halo warmed him up.

476
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,040
 - They said maybe the halo suggested a neutral thermal zone.

477
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,560
 - Yes, very.

478
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,200
 - Like ready-brek makes you glow in the dark.

479
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,280
 - Yeah, exactly, yeah.

480
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,120
 - Sorry.

481
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,880
 - Oh, you're too young to remember those adverts

482
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,720
 from the 1980s.

483
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,320
 Like a kid would eat the ready-brek

484
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,400
 and then they would go to school

485
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,560
 and they would just have a glow around them all day.

486
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,720
 - It was a few, it sort of looks a bit nuclear,

487
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,560
 doesn't it?

488
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,400
 - It does now you think about it, yeah.

489
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,680
 - And it was the 80s, it was a time of anxiety.

490
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,720
 - Surprised it worked.

491
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,200
 - That's why porridge is now so much more popular

492
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,040
 than ready-brek.

493
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,160
 - Yeah.

494
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,440
 - You're out and it's cold and it's really cold

495
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,280
 and you're in big trouble.

496
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,560
 You're riding your horse along, yeah.

497
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,400
 - Oh, okay.

498
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,360
 I was on the night out in Leeds in my head

499
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,200
 and now I'm, well, you can still be on the night out in Leeds.

500
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,440
 - These are the bar with Joey Essex.

501
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,360
 Buying beers for everyone.

502
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,400
 - I just remember that's the coldest I've ever been

503
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,640
 after a night out in Leeds.

504
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,640
 So that's where I am.

505
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,460
 - Okay, go on.

506
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,300
 - But you're on your horse.

507
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,140
 - I'm on my horse.

508
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,600
 - You're on your way home, back to the premier Inn.

509
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,600
 - Premier Inn, yeah.

510
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,760
 - There's no room at the premier Inn.

511
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,880
 (laughing)

512
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,640
 Outside there's a baby who's been put on the floor,

513
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,800
 which is a very bad idea.

514
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,320
 - Okay.

515
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,600
 - Your horse dies under you.

516
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,440
 - Oh, your horse died.

517
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,280
 - On your way back to the premier Inn.

518
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,400
 - Probably punched by a Leeds United fan.

519
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,600
 Over my head.

520
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,480
 It's really cold.

521
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,880
 It's a long way to go to the premier Inn.

522
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,720
 - Yeah.

523
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,560
 - What do you do?

524
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,520
 - Well, I would have walked.

525
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,720
 - Oh, you do the Leen under camp here thing.

526
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,680
 - You can't open your horse and sleep inside.

527
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,520
 - Exactly.

528
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,360
 - Oh, I see.

529
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,200
 - Oh.

530
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,020
 - Wait, is that a klaxon?

531
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:13,860
 - It's not really.

532
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,800
 It has been done once at least that we know of

533
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,560
 by a missionary in America who in 1860,

534
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,400
 he did lose a leg.

535
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,560
 He had to have leg amputated.

536
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,400
 - Okay.

537
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,240
 - But he did survive.

538
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,120
 But I was reading, do you remember the bit in Star Wars

539
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,400
 where Luke Skywalker has to cut open his big fluffy,

540
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,480
 no, his sort of pack animal.

541
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,320
 - That's right.

542
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,600
 - And then he gets shoved in it.

543
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,840
 - Okay.

544
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,840
 - But I read an article saying it wouldn't work.

545
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,880
 You would really don't have long

546
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,480
 even if you cut open your horse and get it.

547
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,320
 - Hang on, are you saying it would work?

548
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,200
 So it's how one person's done it and achieved it,

549
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,040
 but broadly--

550
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,580
 - You couldn't do it overnight.

551
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,520
 - It must depend how cold it is.

552
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,940
 'Cause if it's like, let's say it's 10 degrees,

553
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,780
 it's a bit nippy.

554
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,060
 (all laughing)

555
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,900
 Probably you can cut open your horse

556
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,560
 and it'll just give you enough wax to keep--

557
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,400
 - That would be fine.

558
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,720
 - That headline then becomes, was this necessary?

559
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,600
 (all laughing)

560
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,140
 - There's a taboo against pointing at rainbows

561
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,100
 from around the world.

562
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,820
 Lots of different cultures have this.

563
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:08,640
 The Mizo of Myanmar, they think that if you point

564
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,540
 at a rainbow, you have to immediately point

565
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:14,620
 at a hen's basket to stop having some bad luck.

566
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:17,540
 In Malayang region of Papua New Guinea,

567
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,180
 if a child accidentally points at a rainbow,

568
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,980
 they must go and find an old man

569
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,300
 (all laughing)

570
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,860
 and pull his finger.

571
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:28,440
 (all laughing)

572
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:35,660
 - Accidently, if you accidentally point at a rainbow,

573
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,440
 it just feels so unlikely that you'll--

574
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,280
 (all laughing)

575
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,680
 - It does, and there's a group in Ecuador

576
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:44,180
 that if you point at a rainbow, your shoulder will ache.

577
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,340
 And in the Ivory Coast, there's a group where

578
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:50,540
 if you're twins and one of you points at a rainbow,

579
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:53,820
 then you must apply crushed mushrooms to your face.

580
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,340
 - Oh, you wouldn't like that?

581
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:58,040
 - No, and the idea is basically rainbows,

582
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,980
 like to us, they're like happy unicorns, rainbows and stuff,

583
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,100
 but to a lot of people, they're otherworldly weird things

584
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,860
 and pointing is always bad, really.

585
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,800
 You shouldn't point at people or things.

586
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,340
 - Right. - Yeah.

587
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,080
 - If you do point at a rainbow for long enough,

588
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,640
 you will get a sore shoulder.

589
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,440
 - That's true, they're quite ephemeral things, though.

590
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,360
 - I think that you're right, they almost never last long enough

591
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,880
 that you'd get a sore shoulder by pointing.

592
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,080
 - Does the culture that has pulling an old man's finger

593
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,600
 have the same thing that we have when you pull it?

594
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,800
 - I did look and I don't (all laughing)

595
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,480
 I mean, we shouldn't laugh at these things,

596
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,380
 but I mean, 'cause it's people and like it's old, you know.

597
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,720
 - It's actually, yeah, it's incredibly serious.

598
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,900
 - It's serious, yeah.

599
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:44,020
 - But it is, that is objectively funny.

600
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,860
 - It is.

601
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,740
 You know, one person who can withstand

602
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,260
 these extraordinary cold temperatures

603
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,380
 and he's become quite famous, Wim Hof,

604
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,940
 I don't know if anyone's read that book.

605
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:53,780
 - Yeah, the method.

606
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,340
 - The method, Wim Hof method.

607
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:58,620
 So he climbed to an altitude of 7,200 meters

608
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,380
 on Mount Everest wearing nothing but shorts and shoes.

609
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,340
 At one point he had to change to some boots,

610
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,480
 but that was it that he put on.

611
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,680
 He also completed a marathon above the Arctic Circle

612
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,000
 in Finland at close to minus 20,

613
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,240
 dressed in nothing but shorts as well.

614
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,640
 Is it a pretty, what, tops off?

615
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,040
 - Yeah, yeah, and he's sort of is able

616
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,400
 to withstand these things, hence this people doing it.

617
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,280
 It's been, it's had a lot of controversy about it

618
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,160
 in recent times, 'cause a lot of people have either died

619
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,760
 or become ill off the back of it, but he can do it.

620
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,480
 He demonstrably can do it.

621
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,920
 But according to his biographer,

622
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,580
 something he didn't get right was he was swimming

623
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:37,460
 in a fountain in Amsterdam and he decided on a Wim,

624
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:41,220
 oh, on a Wim, to give himself an, brilliant,

625
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,500
 to give himself an enema on the nozzle of the jet

626
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,340
 in the fountain.

627
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,180
 - What?

628
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,700
 - Something I believe that he might have done before,

629
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,940
 but what he didn't know was that earlier that day

630
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,820
 they turned the power up on the spout itself.

631
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:56,380
 And as he sat on the nozzle, it cut through his colon

632
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:59,220
 and his testines, they say like a water knife,

633
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,120
 it kind of just went into him.

634
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,440
 Yeah, and he had to be rushed to hospital

635
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,120
 by his son, Michael.

636
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,960
 - Why was his son there?

637
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,400
 - Well, they're hanging out.

638
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,720
 He goes, I'm gonna quick swim in the fountain.

639
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,000
 - I'm just gonna say, I think that there would be a clue

640
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,240
 that they'd upped the pressure by the fact

641
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,280
 that the water's going miles in the air.

642
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,120
 - Yeah.

643
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,200
 - But it sounds to me like they upped the pressure.

644
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,240
 The moment it came up was as his bum was in there already.

645
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,760
 - Was it the vertical nozzle?

646
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,600
 - Yes.

647
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,520
 - Was he, was he blasted into the air

648
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,160
 and sat in a cartoon style at the top of the fountain

649
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,160
 for a while.

650
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,180
 - I haven't imagined him and all his mates going

651
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,260
 to Las Vegas and sitting at the Bellagio

652
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,220
 as all their fountains go up.

653
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,620
 - What you can't see in that famous scene

654
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,620
 at the end of "Ocean's Eleven"

655
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,300
 where they're all watching the Bellagio fountains

656
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,740
 is Wim Hof at the top of them.

657
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,300
 (laughing)

658
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,580
 - But apparently when he got there,

659
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,180
 he's so hard this guy.

660
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:52,940
 He could go up Mount Everest in no top, in no shoes.

661
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:56,460
 In shorts, they didn't know how serious the injury was

662
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:00,520
 because he was like, "Ah, tis butter, internal scratch."

663
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,920
 - He now has a semi-colon.

664
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,560
 (laughing)

665
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,640
 - So it took ages until he fainted with pain.

666
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,000
 And then after they did all the stuff on him,

667
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,160
 he didn't have any antibiotics during recovery

668
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,920
 because he's such a hard man.

669
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,760
 - Oh yeah.

670
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,980
 - It's not hard to disregard antibiotic

671
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:19,040
 like germ theory is real, sorry.

672
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,200
 I've gone right off him now.

673
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,120
 I was actually with him even in the fountain store.

674
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,840
 I think, okay, he's a crazy guy.

675
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,320
 - He's trying to suppress antibiotic resistance.

676
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,160
 That's a good thing.

677
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,180
 - He doesn't need antibiotics.

678
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,500
 People should never take them

679
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,120
 unless they absolutely need them.

680
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,740
 - I reckon Vim Hof takes like just four of them

681
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,360
 and then doesn't take the last three.

682
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,300
 (laughing)

683
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,100
 He sounds like that kind of guy to me.

684
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,660
 (laughing)

685
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,500
 Is he still alive?

686
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,340
 - He is.

687
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,180
 - Yeah.

688
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,000
 - Still good.

689
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,840
 - In that case, I don't think he does that.

690
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,680
 - Still good.

691
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,520
 (laughing)

692
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,360
 - It wasn't everywhere.

693
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,200
 They thought water was good for you.

694
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,820
 So in America, I was reading the 18th century,

695
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,100
 people thought cold water,

696
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,020
 if you drank cold water, you would die.

697
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:59,020
 And there was a French guy visiting Philadelphia

698
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:02,060
 who said that several people die each year

699
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,360
 drinking the cold pumped water.

700
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,280
 And so everyone's told to leave it out to warm.

701
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,260
 And there are printed hand bills distributed everywhere

702
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:12,500
 and posters put up next to all water pumps saying,

703
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,140
 do not drink this straight away.

704
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,540
 Do not drink this cold.

705
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,980
 You must leave this to warm up.

706
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,660
 But he said, all these teachings are ignored.

707
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:22,700
 And so of course, there is death all over the place.

708
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,540
 - Again, water.

709
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:26,980
 - It's just not having the experiment time

710
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:27,820
 to work it out properly.

711
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,660
 - You just think like,

712
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:31,060
 surely one or two people drank it and didn't die.

713
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:31,900
 - He thinks.

714
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,900
 - And people thought, what happened there?

715
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:34,980
 - No one believed him.

716
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:35,820
 - No one believed him.

717
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:36,660
 - But maybe you got lucky,

718
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,620
 you got a random bit of warm water in there.

719
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,540
 'Cause I've got a tap at home,

720
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,900
 which is so cold that I want to die when I drink from it.

721
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,740
 It's really bad.

722
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,580
 - Right.

723
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,420
 - Yeah.

724
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,260
 - Yeah, okay.

725
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,820
 (laughing)

726
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,540
 - Thank you.

727
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,380
 Somewhere there's a fan listening to our show

728
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,260
 who's piecing all these very micro bits

729
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,100
 of detail.

730
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,740
 They've got like a big board.

731
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,620
 Tap produces cold water.

732
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,540
 Let's sit that next.

733
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,060
 - That's taps at home.

734
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,220
 (laughing)

735
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,060
 - For what?

736
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:06,020
 The most boring obituary ever written.

737
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,700
 - Just slowly piecing together who mysterious Murray is.

738
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,540
 - That's podcasting.

739
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,580
 It's nice to get to know people, isn't it?

740
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,420
 As you listen to them.

741
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,260
 - Oh yeah.

742
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,660
 - We know two things about you now.

743
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,140
 You've got very cold taps

744
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,180
 and you piss in the shower.

745
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,020
 That's it.

746
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:17,980
 (laughing)

747
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:21,540
 - Did you know that the inventor of the Brooklyn Bridge?

748
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,060
 I'm gonna say inventor, I mean engineer.

749
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:23,900
 - Yeah.

750
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,240
 - Like to wrap himself in a damp cold sheet.

751
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,100
 His name was John Roebling.

752
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,060
 - Why did you do the sheet thing?

753
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,260
 - No further data.

754
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,100
 - Cool.

755
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,420
 - Cool himself down.

756
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,260
 - Probably.

757
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,540
 - Like people just did used to think way

758
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,940
 for you're too hot or too cold

759
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,140
 and that was a massive problem.

760
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:42,300
 And I guess it is if you've got hypothermia

761
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,100
 or a massive fever it is.

762
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,020
 But people thought like, you know,

763
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,980
 if you were sick, you could make yourself colder

764
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,340
 or hotter and that would cure you.

765
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,180
 - Yeah.

766
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,020
 - Yeah.

767
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,260
 - They didn't have cow pole.

768
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,100
 - Yeah.

769
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,780
 (laughing)

770
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,940
 - I was looking at another thing

771
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,900
 that was happening around the same time in London

772
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:01,020
 and this was a man called Banks

773
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:04,580
 who had a horse called Morocco

774
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,580
 and it had shoes of silver

775
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:10,340
 and it could dance to music, count and answer questions

776
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,620
 and do all sorts of tricks.

777
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:14,620
 And it once apparently climbed up St. Paul's Cathedral.

778
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,100
 It was really, really popular.

779
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,020
 Everyone in London loved this horse

780
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,700
 and everyone whenever it was on display

781
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,580
 would go and see it.

782
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,780
 And then it went to Italy

783
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:25,100
 and he and the horse and the master

784
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,580
 were both burned on charges of sorcery.

785
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:30,900
 - Oh, that's a bad tool.

786
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,140
 (laughing)

787
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:34,780
 - It's a risky run with magic tricks in those days, isn't it?

788
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,100
 Either you entertain people

789
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,540
 or you're a witch who always ends in your fox.

790
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:41,980
 - Darren Brown's birth to death in New Zealand.

791
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,300
 - One more thing about Formula One

792
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:47,260
 is if you play the sound of a Formula One race

793
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:50,940
 to a Formula One driver and they're blindfolded,

794
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,900
 they can tell where the track is.

795
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,300
 - What is in what corners?

796
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,620
 They can draw you a track.

797
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,540
 - Well, they'll know because they know the track so well.

798
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,980
 So if they like, if it goes,

799
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:01,980
 (imitates sound)

800
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,580
 and then it goes a bit quieter for a bit

801
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,780
 and then it goes louder and then quieter and louder

802
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,500
 and then quieter, they'll go, that's Monza.

803
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,340
 - And that's without the commentary, right?

804
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,180
 (laughing)

805
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,020
 - Okay.

806
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:11,860
 - That's nice.

807
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:12,980
 I love that there's a great thing you can watch online

808
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:17,820
 where Broadway dancers will have to stand in front

809
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,300
 of the stage and behind them,

810
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,460
 someone is doing one of the dance routines

811
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,100
 and they have to join the dance routine

812
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,100
 only by the sound of the steps.

813
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,700
 It's incredible and they get it right so much.

814
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,020
 They're hearing the patterns and then they leap into it

815
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:30,860
 and they match it.

816
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,980
 - Do you reckon, Dan, you could watch the three of us

817
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,060
 doing a podcast.

818
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,340
 You'll just see in our mouths moving,

819
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,220
 but you can't hear what we're saying.

820
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,300
 Do you reckon you could sort of join in and jump in

821
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,860
 at the right time and say the most sensible things?

822
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,100
 - Yeah, yeah, I'd be like,

823
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:45,620
 James is right, golf is interesting actually.

824
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,460
 - Yeah.

825
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,300
 - Don never jumps in anyway saying

826
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,300
 the most sensible things.

827
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,220
 It's sort of irrelevant whether you can hear us or not.

828
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,860
 - This is how I run my whole game on this show.

829
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,220
 - I'm not convinced he's heard anything we've said

830
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,260
 for the last 10 years.

831
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:59,300
 - Do you know the saltiest big body of water in the world?

832
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,640
 - Dead Sea.

833
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,260
 - It's not, in fact, it's this really cool thing.

834
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,580
 So there are a couple of Antarctica

835
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,740
 that are the saltiest in the world,

836
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,820
 but you can't swim in them or anything obviously

837
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,020
 'cause they're in Antarctica.

838
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:12,260
 But there is a place called Lake Retba in Senegal,

839
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:16,580
 which is 40% saltiness compared to Dead Sea is 34%.

840
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,820
 - And you know how you sink in the Dead Sea, Anna?

841
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,740
 We've said this before.

842
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:20,580
 - We have, I know.

843
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,060
 - The only passage, you reckon you might float in this

844
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:23,900
 40% out?

845
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:24,820
 - I've put my tickets.

846
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,140
 I'm going to Senegal next week.

847
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,140
 You have to find someone else.

848
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,740
 I must find out.

849
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,140
 - Wait, so what do you say 40% saltiness?

850
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,980
 Is it 40% salt?

851
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,580
 - Yeah, 40% concentration.

852
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:34,700
 - Wow.

853
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,240
 - And it's also pink.

854
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,080
 - Oh.

855
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:37,920
 - Cool, right?

856
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,820
 It's double whammy.

857
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,700
 And you can swim in it and people go and bathe in it.

858
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,540
 - Cool.

859
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:44,260
 - And it's got a special algae that makes it sort of orangey.

860
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,540
 It's one of those ones that says it's pink

861
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,860
 and all the photos look bright pink.

862
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,580
 And then you read the one blogger who says,

863
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,460
 I went there and everyone's enhanced their photos

864
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,140
 enormously, but still you can float in it, you know?

865
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:54,980
 - That's cool.

866
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:55,820
 - You can walk around in it.

867
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,660
 - Very cool.

868
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,500
 - That's nice.

869
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,340
 - Yeah.

870
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,740
 - I've been to one in, where was it?

871
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:03,660
 Maybe it was in America where like animals go in there

872
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:06,300
 and then they turn to salt.

873
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:09,020
 - Were they petrify or were they?

874
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,740
 - But actually like it turns out it's a bit of a myth.

875
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,380
 Like they die through natural causes

876
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,940
 and then slowly the salt sort of grows on their body.

877
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:19,460
 But people say, oh, this, you know,

878
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:22,500
 pelican drank a little bit of water and they turned to salt.

879
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,340
 That doesn't happen.

880
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,220
 - So they still believe this stuff in America?

881
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,260
 - It's what we've said.

882
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:29,220
 - I'm not sure anyone really believes it, but yeah.

883
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,060
 - They believe a little mad stuff in America and in Britain.

884
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,380
 I mean, that wouldn't be the craziest thing, would it?

885
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,220
 - No.

886
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,060
 - They believe today.

887
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:39,140
 - In fact, when I went there, there was like an overlooking

888
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:42,300
 road and you could put like your business cards there

889
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,580
 for some reason, people were doing it.

890
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,580
 And I had some fish ones, so I put them there.

891
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:48,300
 So we have made our mark.

892
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,300
 - Right, we haven't heard from them yet.

893
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,620
 (laughing)

894
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,620
 - They've all turned to salt.

895
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,460
 - Saltified.

896
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,140
 - The wife of Lot is there.

897
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,220
 (laughing)

898
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,100
 - Do you know Henry VIII executed all the horses

899
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,780
 that were too short?

900
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,620
 - Is that like a eugenics thing?

901
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,460
 - Basically, yeah.

902
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:07,020
 He decided that the horse stock was getting a bit shit.

903
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,220
 - That's early for eugenics as well, isn't it?

904
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,060
 - He's a pioneer.

905
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:12,340
 - He is a pioneer in his day and I respect it.

906
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,620
 (laughing)

907
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:16,460
 - Finally a tick for the horrific reputation

908
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,300
 of Henry VIII.

909
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,420
 - This is the actual Parliamentary Act,

910
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,380
 the Breed of Horses Act, 1535.

911
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:25,500
 No stallion under 15 hands was allowed to exist anymore

912
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,620
 and no mare under 13 hands, which is quite, you know,

913
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,460
 it's quite big.

914
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,900
 - So it's like an active thing, not just they die out,

915
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,500
 just that you have to actively off your horse.

916
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,580
 - There were culls every year.

917
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,980
 - It's terrible when you're on the part land.

918
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:36,820
 You're too short.

919
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:37,740
 - I would try and get around it.

920
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:40,060
 - Yeah, you would put three horses in a trench cull.

921
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,900
 (laughing)

922
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,260
 - I would paint the horse with,

923
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,180
 is it vertical stripes or horizontal stripes?

924
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,500
 - To make them a little taller?

925
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:51,100
 - Yeah, I wish I would carry around,

926
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,660
 I would make the horse carry around a smaller horse,

927
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,500
 would I?

928
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,340
 - Yeah.

929
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,580
 - Or then you have to kill off that horse.

930
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,420
 - Yeah.

931
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,180
 - I would hire someone with small hands

932
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,780
 so the horse cleared the bar.

933
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,620
 - Yes.

934
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,460
 - That worked?

935
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,700
 - Maybe that's why horseshoes were invented

936
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,500
 was little platform shoes for horses to save them.

937
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,180
 - They used to look like the Spice Girls, didn't they?

938
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,520
 - Yes.

939
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,300
 - Mars was quite important in early Rome, wasn't he?

940
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:14,020
 And he was associated with woodpeckers,

941
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,580
 which meant that there was a law

942
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:18,100
 against eating woodpeckers in ancient Rome.

943
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:18,940
 - Yeah.

944
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,860
 - It doesn't feel like a law that would impact

945
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,180
 many people's lives too drastically.

946
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,180
 - Oh, they're so delicious.

947
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:24,020
 (laughing)

948
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,500
 - For all we know, they're incredibly yummy.

949
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,820
 - Yeah, yeah.

950
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:28,660
 I doubt it.

951
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,660
 They've got those strong skulls to withstand all the pecking.

952
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,940
 - They scramble themselves.

953
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,580
 (laughing)

954
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,500
 - I think woodpecker tongs was a thing

955
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,460
 for a while, people would eat woodpecker tongs.

956
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,460
 They're very long, aren't they?

957
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,940
 - They've got tongs so long

958
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,140
 that they wrap around their brains.

959
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:41,980
 - Yeah, yes.

960
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,820
 - It was to protect their brain in part.

961
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,660
 - Sorry.

962
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,500
 - I think it is.

963
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,340
 - Yeah, yeah.

964
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,900
 - I thought you meant woodpecker tongs

965
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:47,980
 like as a piece of cutlery

966
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,340
 with which you ate woodpeckers,

967
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:51,300
 specifically like you have, you know.

968
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,140
 (laughing)

969
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,340
 - No, woodpecker fork.

970
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,060
 - Mrs. Jones is coming round

971
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,620
 and get the woodpecker tongs.

972
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,460
 Oh, no, we, oh, what a faux pas.

973
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,900
 (laughing)

974
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,620
 - Just annoying, unannoying car noises.

975
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,580
 The car horn, quite annoying now,

976
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:07,500
 used to be so much worse.

977
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,100
 So the word klaxon in fact comes from,

978
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,540
 was invented for cars.

979
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,500
 - Jeremy klaxon, yes.

980
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,340
 (laughing)

981
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,180
 - Yes.

982
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,020
 - He invented it.

983
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:18,380
 - Oh, why hasn't he changed his name?

984
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,740
 He should.

985
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:23,020
 So this was sort of pre-war, pre-Second World War.

986
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,900
 Cars had horns that were like klaxons.

987
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,340
 So, you know, the klaxon noise is like a woo.

988
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,180
 - A woo-ga.

989
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,020
 - A woo-ga.

990
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:29,840
 - Yeah.

991
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,680
 - Yeah, it was that.

992
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,260
 But you, was I saying to you guys last week

993
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,580
 that my grandma always honked the horn

994
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,900
 when she turned, when she took corners?

995
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,940
 Well, that used to be the rule.

996
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,140
 You'd be fined if you didn't,

997
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,660
 because there was no other way of knowing

998
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,540
 when car engines weren't as big.

999
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,420
 And so they were constantly,

1000
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,700
 whenever anyone turned a corner,

1001
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,460
 when everyone was coming up to a junction,

1002
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,820
 whenever you were about to park,

1003
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,980
 you beeped your, woo-ga.

1004
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:50,820
 - That is annoying.

1005
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,660
 - And people hated it.

1006
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:52,580
 - It's kind of like the legacy

1007
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,140
 of the man with the red flag.

1008
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:54,980
 - Yes.

1009
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:55,820
 - A little bit.

1010
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,780
 - But less annoying, the man with the red flag.

1011
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,140
 I don't think I'd mind that as much.

1012
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:02,060
 It's a bit like, beep, beep, vehicle reversing.

1013
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:05,540
 - So, do you know who the godfather of backing up is?

1014
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,060
 - Like the godfather of soul.

1015
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,900
 - Yeah, just like that.

1016
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:12,700
 - Do you mean the sound or literally backing up a car?

1017
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,380
 - The sound that's made when you back up a car,

1018
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:16,300
 the beeping, when you're reversing.

1019
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,980
 - So, who's the godfather of creating that sound?

1020
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:18,820
 I don't get what you're asking.

1021
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,060
 - It's a man called Ed Peterson.

1022
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:20,900
 - Okay.

1023
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,100
 - Oh, I was just about to say him.

1024
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,500
 - So, he was the pioneer in the West,

1025
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,740
 and he may have been beaten to it

1026
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:29,620
 by Matthew Saburo Yamaguchi in 1953.

1027
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:32,340
 But Peterson noticed, he was working at a dam,

1028
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,340
 a construction project, huge construction project.

1029
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,700
 And he noticed, gosh, people keep being killed or injured

1030
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,700
 when really heavy vehicles reverse into them.

1031
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,460
 If only there was some, and he said the flag men

1032
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,700
 were just not doing their jobs.

1033
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,580
 And that was the system.

1034
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,740
 Weirdly, the, you know, like waving flags around

1035
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,820
 saying, look out, someone's reversing.

1036
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,980
 That system wasn't working.

1037
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:52,860
 - I can't believe if you're holding a flag to wave

1038
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:53,780
 and a person about to get run over,

1039
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,900
 why aren't you also going,

1040
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,220
 there's a car, it's about to run you over,

1041
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,060
 there's a car, quick, get out of the way.

1042
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,020
 - I don't know.

1043
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,500
 Maybe they're standing at a distance.

1044
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,460
 - Probably a union thing.

1045
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,340
 - Yeah, a union thing.

1046
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:05,460
 - We won't pay them extra for that.

1047
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,060
 - Anyway, just wanted to give him his credit.

1048
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,820
 Ed Peterson, all right.

1049
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:12,260
 - Do you know who has the best car horns?

1050
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,100
 - Ooh.

1051
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,300
 - What country?

1052
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,180
 - Oh, is there a country where it's, you know,

1053
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:19,940
 it leaps south like in "Jukes of Huzzard"?

1054
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:22,220
 ♪ Ha da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da ♪

1055
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:26,300
 - Ah, so you're interpreting it differently to how I mean.

1056
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,140
 - The best.

1057
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:30,660
 - So, by best, it's long lasting, louder.

1058
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,500
 This is in India.

1059
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,260
 - Yeah, it is in India, and the reason is that

1060
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,260
 because the culture of driving there

1061
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:40,700
 has a much more emphasis on the beeping when you're in,

1062
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:43,100
 and so they need cars, they actually make,

1063
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:46,540
 like Audi make stronger, better horns

1064
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,700
 so that they don't run them down

1065
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,380
 with the amount that they're using them.

1066
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,820
 - That is, they do use it properly in India.

1067
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:55,300
 They use it to tell you, "I'm about to drive into you."

1068
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,140
 - You're in danger, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1069
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,580
 - Well, that implies that incredibly bad drivers,

1070
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,900
 if they're always using it properly,

1071
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,820
 but they're always using it.

1072
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,780
 - I think it's so busy traffic-wise.

1073
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,620
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1074
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:08,780
 - And the way to cross the road is just to get cracking.

1075
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:12,380
 - It's like British Kettles, they're long lasting.

1076
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,980
 This is personal anecdote, but--

1077
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:14,820
 - British Kettles.

1078
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:15,860
 - British Kettles. - Best in the world.

1079
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,860
 - Yeah, I was just confused by the analogy.

1080
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:18,820
 - Well, I'm just remembering

1081
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:21,020
 because Dan's wife has bought like 20 Kettles.

1082
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:23,020
 - Yeah, she keeps buying European ones

1083
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,420
 because they look nice and they keep dying

1084
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,860
 'cause they can't keep up with the British tea consuming.

1085
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:28,700
 - Out of the kilowatts.

1086
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,540
 - Yeah. - It's an anecdote,

1087
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,380
 it's just gone flooding back.

1088
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:33,100
 (all laughing)

1089
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:36,620
 - Did you come across the car that Cadillac invented

1090
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:38,740
 which had a working toilet in it?

1091
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,580
 - Oh.

1092
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,820
 - Sorry, not Cadillac invented.

1093
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:44,060
 One random bloke modified so that he could,

1094
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,300
 this was a guy called Louis Matta

1095
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:49,540
 and he wanted to drive 10,000 kilometers without stopping.

1096
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,020
 LA to New York and back.

1097
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,460
 - Right, so he must have put the toilet on the driving seat.

1098
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,300
 - He put the toilet,

1099
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,620
 well, there were a couple of them in the car.

1100
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,540
 - How long does it take to drive that distance?

1101
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,540
 - It must be like 10 days.

1102
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:02,060
 - That would be 1,000 kilometers a day,

1103
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:04,300
 maybe a bit longer than that, I think that's quite a bit.

1104
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,140
 - Yeah.

1105
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:09,300
 - He will have to stop at some stage to sleep, right?

1106
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,140
 - Well, no, but there were a couple of them in the car.

1107
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:13,300
 So they would shift into the driving seat.

1108
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:17,220
 This was in 1952, for God knows why he wanted to do this.

1109
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:20,340
 But he'd been in the Navy, he was an engineer

1110
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:22,180
 and it had a toilet, it had a shower,

1111
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:25,300
 it had a TV, a fridge and a sink

1112
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,140
 and they were escorted when they were in a town

1113
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:28,220
 by the local police who would help them

1114
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:29,340
 through the traffic lights.

1115
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,580
 So they could literally keep moving for this time.

1116
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,540
 - It's just like a caravan really.

1117
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:36,220
 - It's just like a caravan, except I love this.

1118
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:38,940
 What's another flaw in this plan?

1119
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,660
 - We have to let out what you're carrying.

1120
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,180
 - Now I assume he's got a shed load of petrol

1121
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,900
 that's filling up the car.

1122
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:48,820
 - He can refuel on the go, that's cool.

1123
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:52,820
 And what if the worst happens, you burst a tire,

1124
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,420
 they had a system to change a tire

1125
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,060
 while the car was driving.

1126
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:59,740
 - Wow, it's so cool, as Jack would lift up one tire

1127
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,620
 and this tiny little supermarket trolley wheel

1128
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,380
 would take that corner of the car

1129
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,460
 and then his friends would like lean over the side

1130
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,540
 and change the tire and then change it back

1131
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,460
 and then you just pop it back up.

1132
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,860
 - You would be impossible to steer

1133
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:13,180
 if it's got a supermarket trolley wheel on it.

1134
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:15,300
 (all laughing)

1135
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,140
 - The laziest all of this bit of observational comedy

1136
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,540
 that's ever been made.

1137
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:22,120
 (upbeat music)

1138
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,540
 - Okay, that's it.

1139
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,860
 That is all of our outtakes.

1140
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:27,940
 We hope you enjoyed that.

1141
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,460
 You got any comments, you got any questions,

1142
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,540
 you got any extra facts,

1143
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:33,020
 why not send them to podcast@qi.com?

1144
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:35,020
 And if they are seen by Andy,

1145
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:37,220
 they might make their way onto an upcoming

1146
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,460
 Drop Us a Line episode.

1147
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,660
 We love getting your emails,

1148
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,300
 so please do send them in.

1149
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,140

 Otherwise come back in a couple of weeks,

1154
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,740

1159
