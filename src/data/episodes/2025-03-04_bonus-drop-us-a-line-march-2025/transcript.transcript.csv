00:00:01,00:00:02,"- Hey, Club Fish members."
00:00:02,00:00:04,Welcome to this week's bonus bit of content.
00:00:04,00:00:08,We have got a compilation episode for you today.
00:00:08,00:00:09,"But before we get into it,"
00:00:09,00:00:10,I just wanna quickly remind some of you
00:00:10,00:00:12,who may have missed the news
00:00:12,00:00:15,"that we are going to do a live show,"
00:00:15,00:00:17,"July 6th at the Crossed Wires Festival,"
00:00:17,00:00:19,which is a festival that was co-created
00:00:19,00:00:22,by our good friend Alice Levine of My Dad Wrote a Porno.
00:00:22,00:00:25,"They started last year, it was a massive success."
00:00:25,00:00:26,They're coming back this year
00:00:26,00:00:27,"and we were really excited to be invited,"
00:00:27,00:00:29,so we're gonna be doing a live recording.
00:00:29,00:00:32,"Now, we didn't do Sheffield on our tour last year."
00:00:32,00:00:34,We really missed out on getting to that bit of the country.
00:00:34,00:00:37,"So if you're in that area, come along."
00:00:37,00:00:39,We're doing a full live recording.
00:00:39,00:00:41,There'll be a few extra fun bits thrown in as well.
00:00:41,00:00:42,"And if you wanna get tickets,"
00:00:42,00:00:44,go to nosuchthingasafish.com.
00:00:44,00:00:46,You'll find all the links there.
00:00:46,00:00:48,And why not check out what other podcasts are on.
00:00:48,00:00:50,It is genuinely a great pod festival.
00:00:50,00:00:52,"All right, well, let's get to the compilation."
00:00:52,00:00:53,Here are the best of the outtakes
00:00:53,00:00:55,that never made it to the main show.
00:00:55,00:00:56,Here we go.
00:00:58,00:01:01,(upbeat music)
00:01:01,00:01:14,- She had been told the gaitnesses.
00:01:14,00:01:17,She turned up to the unveiling of the Statue of Liberty.
00:01:17,00:01:18,- Oh yeah.
00:01:18,00:01:19,- Which I really liked.
00:01:19,00:01:20,She turned that she was not invited.
00:01:20,00:01:23,But she turned up on a cattle barge.
00:01:23,00:01:25,"So she turned up on a barge with a megaphone,"
00:01:25,00:01:27,"shouting that it was a gigantic lie,"
00:01:27,00:01:28,a travesty and a mockery
00:01:28,00:01:31,to make the representation of Liberty a woman
00:01:31,00:01:33,when actual women had so few rights at the time.
00:01:33,00:01:34,"So that was her, that was her prototype."
00:01:34,00:01:36,"- She's shackled though, isn't she?"
00:01:36,00:01:38,"- Oh, is she broken her shackles?"
00:01:38,00:01:39,- I don't think she's shackled.
00:01:39,00:01:40,- Is she not?
00:01:40,00:01:41,"- I should know, I've been up it."
00:01:41,00:01:42,And I don't know.
00:01:42,00:01:44,"- Yeah, but that's what you're on the inside."
00:01:44,00:01:47,"You can't see me outside, can you, from there?"
00:01:47,00:01:48,"- Oh, and I haven't been up it either."
00:01:48,00:01:50,"Sorry, I was missing one."
00:01:50,00:01:51,What just happened?
00:01:51,00:01:52,I've been near it.
00:01:52,00:01:54,"- Oh yeah, we all bit, we went together."
00:01:54,00:01:55,We were near it when we went to do yard.
00:01:55,00:01:56,- I've been closer than that.
00:01:56,00:01:57,- I love you.
00:01:57,00:01:58,"- Yeah, yeah, but she's not, I don't think she,"
00:01:58,00:01:59,I'm pretty sure she's not shackled.
00:01:59,00:02:00,- I don't think she's shackled.
00:02:00,00:02:02,"- I thought one of her legs had a shackle on it,"
00:02:02,00:02:02,but maybe I'm wrong.
00:02:02,00:02:04,- She's got slippers that I know that much.
00:02:04,00:02:05,- Slippers.
00:02:05,00:02:06,- I think they're more sandals.
00:02:06,00:02:08,"- Yeah, slip-ons, like the open toad."
00:02:08,00:02:10,You could see her feet.
00:02:10,00:02:11,- Yeah.
00:02:11,00:02:11,- She's a woman in comfortable shoes.
00:02:11,00:02:12,"- While you stayed outside,"
00:02:12,00:02:14,you got one of those wiki feet things going on.
00:02:14,00:02:16,(laughing)
00:02:16,00:02:19,"- So, true feminists should campaign"
00:02:19,00:02:21,for the Statue of Liberty to be a man?
00:02:21,00:02:24,"- Yeah, and yet, and yet my campaign has done nothing."
00:02:24,00:02:26,(laughing)
00:02:26,00:02:30,- I have one more caddy called Daft Willy Gunn.
00:02:30,00:02:33,He is an old school one in Scotland.
00:02:33,00:02:36,"He was from the 19th century, early 19th century."
00:02:36,00:02:40,"He always wore four coats, three or four pairs of trousers."
00:02:40,00:02:41,- It is cold in Scotland.
00:02:41,00:02:42,- It is cold.
00:02:42,00:02:44,"He couldn't afford like a big coat or anything,"
00:02:44,00:02:46,so he just wore like lots of small ones.
00:02:46,00:02:48,- To false economy.
00:02:48,00:02:50,(laughing)
00:02:50,00:02:51,Spend the money on a good coat.
00:02:51,00:02:56,- He would only eat milk and soft bread rolls his whole life.
00:02:56,00:02:59,And he would be in St Andrews in Scotland.
00:02:59,00:03:01,"And then when the golf season finished,"
00:03:01,00:03:04,he would walk off and no one knew where he went.
00:03:04,00:03:06,He just presumably walked home somewhere.
00:03:06,00:03:08,"And then when the season started, he walked back again."
00:03:08,00:03:09,And that was it.
00:03:09,00:03:11,- He's a really great train.
00:03:11,00:03:14,"- And then one day, they stumbled upon a grave,"
00:03:14,00:03:16,which said he died in 1522.
00:03:16,00:03:18,(laughing)
00:03:18,00:03:21,"- Well, one day in 1820, he walked north, never to return."
00:03:21,00:03:24,"And to this day, nobody knows what happened to him."
00:03:24,00:03:25,- He's still out there.
00:03:25,00:03:26,- That's great.
00:03:26,00:03:27,- Do you know that fact?
00:03:27,00:03:28,Have I ever said it on this?
00:03:28,00:03:29,I don't think I have.
00:03:29,00:03:32,"It was during the Winter War, I think,"
00:03:32,00:03:33,between Russia and Finland.
00:03:33,00:03:36,And there was a guy who was captured.
00:03:36,00:03:38,And it turned out that he was trying to hide in the snow
00:03:38,00:03:40,by putting doilies on his head.
00:03:40,00:03:41,(laughing)
00:03:41,00:03:43,And he reckoned it worked for ages
00:03:43,00:03:46,because they were white doilies and no one could see him.
00:03:46,00:03:49,- But why had he taken so many doilies to a comfort zone?
00:03:49,00:03:50,"I said, did he just think,"
00:03:50,00:03:52,I know this is gonna work.
00:03:52,00:03:56,- I think he might have plundered them from houses.
00:03:56,00:03:57,"- Really, of course, 'cause you would get doilies."
00:03:57,00:03:59,"I mean, you don't get doilies anymore."
00:03:59,00:04:00,"It's a really, really sad fact."
00:04:00,00:04:03,"I mean, you get sort of weak doilies on trains these days,"
00:04:03,00:04:05,"but even then only on nice trains, they're not very good."
00:04:05,00:04:07,- Let's make me think if you're Jewish
00:04:07,00:04:08,"and you have a Yamaha,"
00:04:08,00:04:11,"do you, if you were going certain places with the army,"
00:04:11,00:04:13,would you match it to your environment?
00:04:13,00:04:15,"You're going somewhere winter, where are white?"
00:04:15,00:04:16,- Like a Kamoka.
00:04:16,00:04:17,(laughing)
00:04:17,00:04:19,"- But in all these scenarios,"
00:04:19,00:04:20,"and in this one that you've described,"
00:04:20,00:04:22,you didn't really have to bury yourself up to the eyebrows.
00:04:22,00:04:24,- I think it was more like his hair
00:04:24,00:04:26,"would show up against the snow,"
00:04:26,00:04:27,but you maybe had a white coat.
00:04:27,00:04:29,- Did he get caught when some Russians turned up
00:04:29,00:04:30,"and thought, oh, a lovely comfy armchair."
00:04:30,00:04:32,I'll just put my left arm here.
00:04:32,00:04:34,- He doesn't put like double T on that.
00:04:34,00:04:35,(laughing)
00:04:35,00:04:37,"- Wait a minute, what's a doily doing here?"
00:04:37,00:04:39,"You know what, I only half remembered the story, so."
00:04:39,00:04:41,"- Wait, is a doily's for your head, isn't it?"
00:04:41,00:04:42,Is it a coaster?
00:04:42,00:04:44,"- No, a doily is the thing you put on a table"
00:04:44,00:04:46,"and you put, it's a bit bigger than a coaster,"
00:04:46,00:04:47,but you put your tea pot on it.
00:04:47,00:04:48,- What am I thinking of here?
00:04:48,00:04:49,- I think-- - I'm lazy.
00:04:49,00:04:51,- An anti-McCassar. - An anti-McCassar.
00:04:51,00:04:53,- I'm so sorry. - I think I'm an anti-McCassar.
00:04:53,00:04:54,- An anti-McCassar is the thing you don't get anymore.
00:04:54,00:04:56,I've got doily's coming out of my arse.
00:04:56,00:04:58,(laughing)
00:04:58,00:04:59,"- It's weird that they're the same material though,"
00:04:59,00:05:01,so you obviously it was material-based confusion.
00:05:01,00:05:02,"Anyway. - Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:05:02,00:05:04,- I don't think a doily would work as an anti-McCassar
00:05:04,00:05:04,"'cause it's got holes in it,"
00:05:04,00:05:06,so all the MacCassar juice would get on the chair.
00:05:06,00:05:07,- You're right.
00:05:07,00:05:08,- What's a MacCassar?
00:05:08,00:05:10,"- So MacCassar is like-- - Oh, God."
00:05:10,00:05:11,"- We have gone off topic, haven't we?"
00:05:11,00:05:14,"- MacCassar is hair oil that in the 19th century,"
00:05:14,00:05:15,"you'd have lots of, you'd slather yourself."
00:05:15,00:05:16,"- Yeah, yeah. - You'd make memory."
00:05:16,00:05:17,So that's why the anti--
00:05:17,00:05:19,- We don't need to combine this in the 19th century.
00:05:19,00:05:20,"- Sorry, you popped your tiger balm in your hair."
00:05:20,00:05:23,Your anti-McCassar is when you go on the train
00:05:23,00:05:25,"or at a chair, you sit in a comfy chair,"
00:05:25,00:05:28,you need a layer of cloth between your head
00:05:28,00:05:28,and the fabric of the chair
00:05:28,00:05:31,so that the oil doesn't soak into the chair itself.
00:05:31,00:05:32,So that's an anti-McCassar.
00:05:32,00:05:34,"James is right, a doily is the kind of coaster."
00:05:34,00:05:35,- Is that what they put on airplanes when you say--
00:05:35,00:05:38,"- Yeah, anti-McCassar. - That's an anti-McCassar."
00:05:38,00:05:40,"- Should we talk about L Frank Baum? - Yeah, sure."
00:05:40,00:05:42,- I've only got anti-McCassar material.
00:05:42,00:05:46,"Do you know how scientists,"
00:05:46,00:05:49,"if they've got a healer monster to test its health levels,"
00:05:49,00:05:50,how they test them?
00:05:50,00:05:54,"- Okay, so I'm gonna give you a clue."
00:05:54,00:05:55,- Tremel is classic.
00:05:55,00:05:56,"- Nice, that's good."
00:05:56,00:05:59,It's actually not to test how fit they are in a gym sense.
00:05:59,00:06:02,It's more like how many reserves do they have?
00:06:02,00:06:03,How long do they get to last in the desert?
00:06:03,00:06:05,"- Tales of conference, 'cause that's where they keep their friends."
00:06:05,00:06:08,It's related to Archimedes.
00:06:08,00:06:10,- They put it in a bath and how much water comes out.
00:06:10,00:06:11,- It's exactly it.
00:06:11,00:06:13,They dunk their tail in a cup of water
00:06:13,00:06:14,and then you just measure how much comes out
00:06:14,00:06:16,and then you know how fat the tail is.
00:06:16,00:06:17,- It was a bit of an easy clue.
00:06:17,00:06:18,"I'll have to, sorry about that."
00:06:18,00:06:19,"But you know, I didn't want it to go on forever."
00:06:19,00:06:21,"It was gonna be a fun game, was it?"
00:06:21,00:06:23,"- So they are venomous, right?"
00:06:23,00:06:25,And I think only two people are recorded
00:06:25,00:06:28,"to have ever died, one last year and one in 1930."
00:06:28,00:06:31,"And, but the reason they're not very dangerous"
00:06:31,00:06:34,is that they don't have a mechanism to inject their venom.
00:06:34,00:06:37,What they've got is they've got teeth with grooves in
00:06:37,00:06:39,and they have to bite into you
00:06:39,00:06:41,and then just chew up and down and up and down
00:06:41,00:06:43,and up and down and flood their mouth with venom
00:06:43,00:06:45,and chew the venom into you.
00:06:45,00:06:48,So it's quite hard for them to have a victim.
00:06:48,00:06:50,"So they've got, it's very inefficient."
00:06:50,00:06:52,- I read it takes like 15 minutes.
00:06:52,00:06:53,"- Well, the guy who died last year,"
00:06:53,00:06:54,he'd been bitten for four minutes.
00:06:54,00:06:55,"- Yeah, there was a suggestion"
00:06:55,00:06:57,that you might have had an allergic reaction.
00:06:57,00:06:58,- Interesting.
00:06:58,00:07:00,"- Yeah, it can be quite scary, I think."
00:07:00,00:07:04,"There was a 1959 movie called The Giant Healer Monster,"
00:07:04,00:07:09,which apparently features a Mexican bearded lizard
00:07:09,00:07:10,instead of a healer monster.
00:07:10,00:07:12,- You wouldn't get away with that these days.
00:07:12,00:07:14,"- Beard, no, exactly."
00:07:14,00:07:18,"You have to skin an actual healer monster, don't you?"
00:07:18,00:07:21,But it was the first ever double feature film
00:07:21,00:07:24,where you paid for one film and you got two.
00:07:24,00:07:25,"- Oh, right, that's great."
00:07:25,00:07:27,- And it was the first ever film
00:07:27,00:07:30,that was shot and produced in Dallas.
00:07:30,00:07:32,- Really? - Wow.
00:07:32,00:07:34,- But the double feature that you got
00:07:34,00:07:36,was the giant healer monster.
00:07:36,00:07:39,And the other one was called The Killer Shrews.
00:07:39,00:07:40,"- Oh, wow."
00:07:40,00:07:41,"Which one, headlines?"
00:07:41,00:07:44,"- I mean, it's gotta be a double headline now."
00:07:44,00:07:45,- It is a double headline.
00:07:45,00:07:48,"Yeah, I watched the trailer for the Healer Monster movie."
00:07:48,00:07:50,"It's wild, it's wonderful."
00:07:50,00:07:54,"Actually, I lie, I watched it for the remake in 2012,"
00:07:54,00:07:57,simply called Healer with an exclamation mark.
00:07:57,00:08:00,"- Yeah, it's unbelievable these things get remade."
00:08:00,00:08:03,It was at the time acknowledged as an unbelievably bad film.
00:08:03,00:08:04,Who's remaking it?
00:08:04,00:08:06,"- So what, and it's as bad?"
00:08:06,00:08:08,- Did they not remake The Killer Shrews?
00:08:08,00:08:09,"- Oh, I didn't check that, I should have."
00:08:09,00:08:12,"- It's in development help, yeah, yeah."
00:08:12,00:08:13,- Just on strong materials.
00:08:13,00:08:14,This is the stiffest material.
00:08:14,00:08:15,It's all about the hardest.
00:08:15,00:08:17,"There's also the strongest,"
00:08:17,00:08:19,"and that's like how much can you hang off something,"
00:08:19,00:08:19,basically.
00:08:19,00:08:22,"Strongest natural material, thought for ages and ages."
00:08:22,00:08:23,- Spider silk?
00:08:23,00:08:27,"- Spider silk, spider silk."
00:08:27,00:08:28,- Wow.
00:08:28,00:08:33,- I can just imagine Anna as the host of University Challenge.
00:08:33,00:08:36,"Someone gets an answer like, ""Oh, wow, isn't it?"
00:08:36,00:08:38,"""The Chilling Milton, oh."""
00:08:38,00:08:40,"- Well, I've always been so skeptical about this,"
00:08:40,00:08:41,"and I know scientists have always claimed it,"
00:08:41,00:08:43,"but I've just passed so many spiders webs,"
00:08:43,00:08:46,and often I pull at them and they break.
00:08:46,00:08:48,"- You're unbelievably strong, Anna."
00:08:48,00:08:49,"- I am, I am."
00:08:49,00:08:50,- You're like Godzilla.
00:08:50,00:08:51,"- I'm Hercules, yes."
00:08:51,00:08:53,"- Friend of the flies, Anna Tijinski."
00:08:53,00:08:55,- I liberate them.
00:08:55,00:08:58,"I get it, it's pound for pound, they're very thin,"
00:08:58,00:08:59,but it seems so unlikely.
00:08:59,00:09:01,"And anyway, they've been supplanted recently,"
00:09:01,00:09:03,and I believe this much more.
00:09:03,00:09:05,"- They always say ants are really strong,"
00:09:05,00:09:07,but I just stand on them and they're fucking squished.
00:09:07,00:09:12,- It's like I don't understand proportionality.
00:09:12,00:09:14,"Anyway, it was recently found"
00:09:14,00:09:16,that the strongest material is limpid teeth.
00:09:16,00:09:17,"So you know limpids, like the common limpid"
00:09:17,00:09:19,that you see on beaches?
00:09:19,00:09:21,"Their teeth, they're actually on their tongue,"
00:09:21,00:09:23,like we were talking about a bit earlier with mollusks.
00:09:23,00:09:24,"They've got this tongue,"
00:09:24,00:09:27,"and they use it for the same purpose as parrotfish,"
00:09:27,00:09:30,which is just a scrape algae off the rocks.
00:09:30,00:09:31,And apparently the comparison
00:09:31,00:09:34,"is a single string of spaghetti holding,"
00:09:34,00:09:39,"the scientists said 3,500 kilogram bags of sugar,"
00:09:39,00:09:41,which I didn't think was that good a comparison.
00:09:41,00:09:45,So I'm deciding to say it's like a string of spaghetti
00:09:45,00:09:46,"holding a large walrus,"
00:09:46,00:09:50,"or my car with five adults inside, if you know my car."
00:09:50,00:09:51,- Wow.
00:09:51,00:09:52,- I know your car.
00:09:52,00:09:52,"- Yeah, I know your car."
00:09:52,00:09:53,- They imagine that with five adults.
00:09:53,00:09:54,"- It's not like the small,"
00:09:54,00:09:56,"it's a normal, small-ish size car, right?"
00:09:56,00:09:57,"- It's a sco de fab, yeah."
00:09:57,00:09:58,- Yeah.
00:09:58,00:09:59,- I'm not ashamed to say it.
00:09:59,00:10:01,(all laughing)
00:10:01,00:10:02,- That's amazing.
00:10:02,00:10:04,- Cut spaghetti?
00:10:04,00:10:05,- I think it doesn't matter
00:10:05,00:10:09,'cause it's about the width of it.
00:10:09,00:10:10,- It doesn't matter.
00:10:10,00:10:11,- You've been trying this Italian restaurant.
00:10:11,00:10:12,(all laughing)
00:10:12,00:10:13,- It's a nightmare.
00:10:13,00:10:17,"- It's really hard to turn it around at four,"
00:10:17,00:10:18,'cause of it.
00:10:18,00:10:19,(all laughing)
00:10:19,00:10:21,- It's al dente.
00:10:21,00:10:24,(all laughing)
00:10:24,00:10:25,"- I'll tell you one last,"
00:10:25,00:10:27,"this is an alternative actually to a Zempig,"
00:10:27,00:10:29,"'cause you know, others are available,"
00:10:29,00:10:31,"but much better, Vibes."
00:10:31,00:10:33,"- Oh, okay."
00:10:33,00:10:34,- Which is an acronym that stands for
00:10:34,00:10:38,the Vibrating Ingestible Bioelectric Simulator.
00:10:38,00:10:38,- Okay.
00:10:38,00:10:41,- And it is a pill that you swallow
00:10:41,00:10:44,that wiggles and tickles and jiggles inside you
00:10:44,00:10:47,and makes you think you're full.
00:10:47,00:10:49,"It's called, like, it's a battery,"
00:10:49,00:10:51,"a motor, a little vibrating motor,"
00:10:51,00:10:52,"and a membrane, and when you swallow it,"
00:10:52,00:10:53,the membrane dissolves.
00:10:53,00:10:55,"- You know what it sounds like to me, Andy?"
00:10:55,00:10:58,"- A magic bean, and I've got a lot to sell you."
00:10:58,00:10:59,(all laughing)
00:10:59,00:11:01,"- And well, it's been tested in the last couple of years,"
00:11:01,00:11:03,"in 2023, it's been tested on pigs,"
00:11:03,00:11:04,"hasn't got to human trials yet,"
00:11:04,00:11:06,but they ate 40% less.
00:11:06,00:11:09,"- And pigs love to eat, like, they're overweight."
00:11:09,00:11:10,"- They love to eat,"
00:11:10,00:11:12,"and it's been tested on young Yorkshire pigs, apparently."
00:11:12,00:11:13,(all laughing)
00:11:13,00:11:15,It basically means that your stomach
00:11:15,00:11:17,"has been jiggled around and it thinks,"
00:11:17,00:11:19,"oh, there must be loads of food in here."
00:11:19,00:11:19,- Really?
00:11:19,00:11:20,"- And then, yeah."
00:11:20,00:11:22,"- Wow, but then what do I have to eat"
00:11:22,00:11:23,to get rid of that thing?
00:11:23,00:11:24,"- You just eat another one,"
00:11:24,00:11:25,"and then push it the first one through, that's fine."
00:11:25,00:11:27,"- Right, okay, and then just eat a big one and a big one."
00:11:27,00:11:30,"- Wow, what a weird poo that will feel like,"
00:11:30,00:11:32,'cause it's vibrating out your butt.
00:11:32,00:11:34,(all laughing)
00:11:34,00:11:36,"- Here's an interesting thing,"
00:11:36,00:11:39,"avalanches are not nearly as deadly as they used to be,"
00:11:39,00:11:41,and more than half of people who are stuck
00:11:41,00:11:42,in avalanches survive these days.
00:11:42,00:11:43,- Wow.
00:11:43,00:11:47,"- Yeah, and they've got loads of new survival devices"
00:11:47,00:11:50,"that you can have that if you're skiing off-piste,"
00:11:50,00:11:52,you might have them with you.
00:11:52,00:11:53,"- One of them, which is really cool,"
00:11:53,00:11:57,"is a thing called the avalanche airbag system,"
00:11:57,00:11:59,and what you do is when you're skiing
00:11:59,00:12:00,"and you see an avalanche coming,"
00:12:00,00:12:03,"you go, oh, shit, and you pull a toggle,"
00:12:03,00:12:06,and it just puts an airbag around you
00:12:06,00:12:08,"like you're in a car, like you're in a sob,"
00:12:08,00:12:09,but it makes you massive.
00:12:09,00:12:13,"It puts this huge airbag around you,"
00:12:13,00:12:14,and can you guess how it works?
00:12:14,00:12:16,This is really amazing.
00:12:16,00:12:18,- Is it something to do with pressure up in the mountains?
00:12:18,00:12:20,"Well, how it's inflating?"
00:12:20,00:12:22,"- So you know when you get muesli, for instance,"
00:12:22,00:12:24,"you get a big box of muesli,"
00:12:24,00:12:27,"and at the top are all like the big nuts and stuff,"
00:12:27,00:12:29,but at the bottom are all the little grainy bits
00:12:29,00:12:30,that you don't really want to eat.
00:12:30,00:12:31,"- Yeah, this effect has got a name, this effect."
00:12:31,00:12:32,"- Yeah, it's called like the Brazil nut effect"
00:12:32,00:12:34,or something like that.
00:12:34,00:12:36,"Well, this makes you really big,"
00:12:36,00:12:38,"and so when the avalanche is coming down,"
00:12:38,00:12:40,"like a Brazil nut, you float to the top"
00:12:40,00:12:43,and all the small bits of snow go to the bottom.
00:12:43,00:12:44,- Wow.
00:12:44,00:12:45,- Isn't that amazing?
00:12:45,00:12:47,It's called the principle of inverse segregation.
00:12:47,00:12:48,- Wow.
00:12:48,00:12:49,"- And so it keeps you near the top,"
00:12:49,00:12:51,and it makes you easier to find.
00:12:51,00:12:52,"- And while you're waiting,"
00:12:52,00:12:53,you've got all that muesli to get you to buy.
00:12:53,00:12:55,(laughing)
00:12:55,00:12:57,- Have many people done that on purpose?
00:12:57,00:12:59,'Cause I'd imagine it would be tempting.
00:12:59,00:13:02,- It's been used in Europe for over 10 years.
00:13:02,00:13:04,"- No, sorry, as in for fun."
00:13:04,00:13:05,"- Oh, for fun?"
00:13:05,00:13:05,- 'Cause you would have thought
00:13:05,00:13:06,that would be unbelievably good fun.
00:13:06,00:13:08,- It feels like avalanche chasers
00:13:08,00:13:09,"are gonna be a thing, right?"
00:13:09,00:13:10,Like tornado hunters.
00:13:10,00:13:13,"- Yeah, like surfing on the top of an avalanche"
00:13:13,00:13:15,"in your big bubble, how great would that be?"
00:13:15,00:13:17,- I'm gonna say don't try it at home anyway.
00:13:17,00:13:18,- You can't.
00:13:18,00:13:21,(laughing)
00:13:21,00:13:22,- Do you know the most famous frostbite sufferer
00:13:22,00:13:24,of all time?
00:13:24,00:13:25,- Randall Fiennes.
00:13:25,00:13:25,"- Yeah, I would have said him."
00:13:25,00:13:27,"- More famous, even more famous than Randall Fiennes."
00:13:27,00:13:29,- Brian Blessed.
00:13:29,00:13:30,- Think more famous.
00:13:30,00:13:31,- Barack Obama.
00:13:31,00:13:32,- More famous.
00:13:32,00:13:32,- David Asenborough.
00:13:32,00:13:33,- God.
00:13:33,00:13:34,- Albert Einstein.
00:13:34,00:13:35,- Joey Essex.
00:13:35,00:13:36,- God.
00:13:36,00:13:37,- God?
00:13:37,00:13:37,- There was a study in 2004
00:13:37,00:13:39,by a couple of neo-intelligence
00:13:39,00:13:40,who decreed that the baby--
00:13:40,00:13:42,"- Sorry, Joey Essex came at the end."
00:13:42,00:13:43,(laughing)
00:13:43,00:13:44,- Just about to think
00:13:44,00:13:46,of the most famous person I could think of.
00:13:46,00:13:47,- The study found that the baby Jesus
00:13:47,00:13:50,almost certainly had hypothermia as a baby.
00:13:50,00:13:51,"- Oh, and then by extension."
00:13:51,00:13:52,- No?
00:13:52,00:13:53,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:13:53,00:13:54,"- Not God, God."
00:13:54,00:13:55,"- Well, now he is one of the three gods"
00:13:55,00:13:57,that's a kid that makes a god.
00:13:57,00:13:58,"- Well, it depends which one you find."
00:13:58,00:13:59,"- Basically, they looked at a load of,"
00:13:59,00:14:02,they looked at a load of old masters paintings
00:14:02,00:14:03,"from the National Gallery,"
00:14:03,00:14:04,which loads of them are feature of--
00:14:04,00:14:06,"- Oh, and of course they were painted life, weren't they?"
00:14:06,00:14:08,(laughing)
00:14:08,00:14:11,"There was like, there was an ox and an ass"
00:14:11,00:14:13,and three shepherds and a load of fucking painters
00:14:13,00:14:15,"in the car, wasn't there?"
00:14:15,00:14:16,- But you never see them.
00:14:16,00:14:18,"It's like a press gallery, you know."
00:14:18,00:14:21,"So yeah, 90% of these paintings depicted Jesus"
00:14:21,00:14:22,as either naked or scantily clad.
00:14:22,00:14:24,And given that the temperature in Bethlehem
00:14:24,00:14:26,"in late December is about seven Celsius,"
00:14:26,00:14:28,"like, and 60% of the paintings, he's on the floor."
00:14:28,00:14:29,"You think, why have you put the baby on the floor?"
00:14:29,00:14:30,Don't put the baby on the floor.
00:14:30,00:14:32,- He wasn't born on Christmas Day though.
00:14:32,00:14:34,"I know that according to the rules he was,"
00:14:34,00:14:37,but I think we don't think he was.
00:14:37,00:14:40,"- No, okay, but either way, it's clearly a risk."
00:14:40,00:14:41,"And they said that the,"
00:14:41,00:14:43,can you guess the explanation they provided?
00:14:43,00:14:45,I really like this as to why it might have been all right.
00:14:45,00:14:46,'Cause he was God.
00:14:46,00:14:47,- Why he survived it.
00:14:47,00:14:49,- Maybe the halo warmed him up.
00:14:49,00:14:53,- They said maybe the halo suggested a neutral thermal zone.
00:14:53,00:14:54,"- Yes, very."
00:14:54,00:14:57,- Like ready-brek makes you glow in the dark.
00:14:57,00:14:58,"- Yeah, exactly, yeah."
00:14:58,00:14:59,- Sorry.
00:14:59,00:15:00,"- Oh, you're too young to remember those adverts"
00:15:00,00:15:02,from the 1980s.
00:15:02,00:15:04,Like a kid would eat the ready-brek
00:15:04,00:15:05,and then they would go to school
00:15:05,00:15:07,and they would just have a glow around them all day.
00:15:07,00:15:09,"- It was a few, it sort of looks a bit nuclear,"
00:15:09,00:15:10,doesn't it?
00:15:10,00:15:11,"- It does now you think about it, yeah."
00:15:11,00:15:13,"- And it was the 80s, it was a time of anxiety."
00:15:13,00:15:14,- Surprised it worked.
00:15:14,00:15:16,- That's why porridge is now so much more popular
00:15:16,00:15:17,than ready-brek.
00:15:17,00:15:18,- Yeah.
00:15:18,00:15:20,- You're out and it's cold and it's really cold
00:15:20,00:15:21,and you're in big trouble.
00:15:21,00:15:22,"You're riding your horse along, yeah."
00:15:22,00:15:23,"- Oh, okay."
00:15:23,00:15:25,I was on the night out in Leeds in my head
00:15:25,00:15:28,"and now I'm, well, you can still be on the night out in Leeds."
00:15:28,00:15:30,- These are the bar with Joey Essex.
00:15:30,00:15:31,Buying beers for everyone.
00:15:31,00:15:33,- I just remember that's the coldest I've ever been
00:15:33,00:15:35,after a night out in Leeds.
00:15:35,00:15:36,So that's where I am.
00:15:36,00:15:37,"- Okay, go on."
00:15:37,00:15:38,- But you're on your horse.
00:15:38,00:15:39,- I'm on my horse.
00:15:39,00:15:40,"- You're on your way home, back to the premier Inn."
00:15:40,00:15:41,"- Premier Inn, yeah."
00:15:43,00:15:44,- There's no room at the premier Inn.
00:15:44,00:15:46,(laughing)
00:15:46,00:15:48,"Outside there's a baby who's been put on the floor,"
00:15:48,00:15:49,which is a very bad idea.
00:15:49,00:15:51,- Okay.
00:15:51,00:15:52,- Your horse dies under you.
00:15:52,00:15:53,"- Oh, your horse died."
00:15:53,00:15:54,- On your way back to the premier Inn.
00:15:54,00:15:56,- Probably punched by a Leeds United fan.
00:15:56,00:15:58,Over my head.
00:15:58,00:16:01,It's really cold.
00:16:01,00:16:02,It's a long way to go to the premier Inn.
00:16:02,00:16:03,- Yeah.
00:16:03,00:16:04,- What do you do?
00:16:04,00:16:05,"- Well, I would have walked."
00:16:05,00:16:07,"- Oh, you do the Leen under camp here thing."
00:16:07,00:16:09,- You can't open your horse and sleep inside.
00:16:09,00:16:10,- Exactly.
00:16:10,00:16:11,"- Oh, I see."
00:16:11,00:16:12,- Oh.
00:16:12,00:16:13,"- Wait, is that a klaxon?"
00:16:13,00:16:13,- It's not really.
00:16:13,00:16:16,It has been done once at least that we know of
00:16:16,00:16:19,"by a missionary in America who in 1860,"
00:16:19,00:16:20,he did lose a leg.
00:16:20,00:16:21,He had to have leg amputated.
00:16:21,00:16:22,- Okay.
00:16:22,00:16:23,- But he did survive.
00:16:23,00:16:25,"But I was reading, do you remember the bit in Star Wars"
00:16:25,00:16:29,"where Luke Skywalker has to cut open his big fluffy,"
00:16:29,00:16:30,"no, his sort of pack animal."
00:16:30,00:16:31,- That's right.
00:16:31,00:16:32,- And then he gets shoved in it.
00:16:32,00:16:33,- Okay.
00:16:33,00:16:35,- But I read an article saying it wouldn't work.
00:16:35,00:16:36,You would really don't have long
00:16:36,00:16:38,even if you cut open your horse and get it.
00:16:38,00:16:39,"- Hang on, are you saying it would work?"
00:16:39,00:16:41,"So it's how one person's done it and achieved it,"
00:16:41,00:16:42,but broadly--
00:16:42,00:16:43,- You couldn't do it overnight.
00:16:43,00:16:45,- It must depend how cold it is.
00:16:45,00:16:47,"'Cause if it's like, let's say it's 10 degrees,"
00:16:47,00:16:48,it's a bit nippy.
00:16:48,00:16:50,(all laughing)
00:16:50,00:16:51,Probably you can cut open your horse
00:16:51,00:16:53,and it'll just give you enough wax to keep--
00:16:53,00:16:54,- That would be fine.
00:16:54,00:16:56,"- That headline then becomes, was this necessary?"
00:16:56,00:16:59,(all laughing)
00:16:59,00:17:02,- There's a taboo against pointing at rainbows
00:17:02,00:17:03,from around the world.
00:17:03,00:17:04,Lots of different cultures have this.
00:17:04,00:17:08,"The Mizo of Myanmar, they think that if you point"
00:17:08,00:17:10,"at a rainbow, you have to immediately point"
00:17:10,00:17:14,at a hen's basket to stop having some bad luck.
00:17:14,00:17:17,"In Malayang region of Papua New Guinea,"
00:17:17,00:17:20,"if a child accidentally points at a rainbow,"
00:17:20,00:17:21,they must go and find an old man
00:17:21,00:17:24,(all laughing)
00:17:24,00:17:25,and pull his finger.
00:17:25,00:17:28,(all laughing)
00:17:28,00:17:35,"- Accidently, if you accidentally point at a rainbow,"
00:17:35,00:17:37,it just feels so unlikely that you'll--
00:17:37,00:17:38,(all laughing)
00:17:38,00:17:40,"- It does, and there's a group in Ecuador"
00:17:40,00:17:44,"that if you point at a rainbow, your shoulder will ache."
00:17:44,00:17:46,"And in the Ivory Coast, there's a group where"
00:17:46,00:17:50,"if you're twins and one of you points at a rainbow,"
00:17:50,00:17:53,then you must apply crushed mushrooms to your face.
00:17:53,00:17:55,"- Oh, you wouldn't like that?"
00:17:55,00:17:58,"- No, and the idea is basically rainbows,"
00:17:58,00:18:00,"like to us, they're like happy unicorns, rainbows and stuff,"
00:18:00,00:18:04,"but to a lot of people, they're otherworldly weird things"
00:18:04,00:18:05,"and pointing is always bad, really."
00:18:05,00:18:07,You shouldn't point at people or things.
00:18:07,00:18:09,- Right. - Yeah.
00:18:09,00:18:11,"- If you do point at a rainbow for long enough,"
00:18:11,00:18:12,you will get a sore shoulder.
00:18:12,00:18:16,"- That's true, they're quite ephemeral things, though."
00:18:16,00:18:18,"- I think that you're right, they almost never last long enough"
00:18:18,00:18:19,that you'd get a sore shoulder by pointing.
00:18:19,00:18:23,- Does the culture that has pulling an old man's finger
00:18:23,00:18:26,have the same thing that we have when you pull it?
00:18:26,00:18:30,- I did look and I don't (all laughing)
00:18:30,00:18:34,"I mean, we shouldn't laugh at these things,"
00:18:34,00:18:37,"but I mean, 'cause it's people and like it's old, you know."
00:18:37,00:18:39,"- It's actually, yeah, it's incredibly serious."
00:18:39,00:18:40,"- It's serious, yeah."
00:18:40,00:18:44,"- But it is, that is objectively funny."
00:18:44,00:18:44,- It is.
00:18:44,00:18:46,"You know, one person who can withstand"
00:18:46,00:18:49,these extraordinary cold temperatures
00:18:49,00:18:51,"and he's become quite famous, Wim Hof,"
00:18:51,00:18:52,I don't know if anyone's read that book.
00:18:52,00:18:53,"- Yeah, the method."
00:18:53,00:18:55,"- The method, Wim Hof method."
00:18:55,00:18:58,"So he climbed to an altitude of 7,200 meters"
00:18:58,00:19:01,on Mount Everest wearing nothing but shorts and shoes.
00:19:01,00:19:03,"At one point he had to change to some boots,"
00:19:03,00:19:05,but that was it that he put on.
00:19:05,00:19:08,He also completed a marathon above the Arctic Circle
00:19:08,00:19:11,"in Finland at close to minus 20,"
00:19:11,00:19:13,dressed in nothing but shorts as well.
00:19:13,00:19:15,"Is it a pretty, what, tops off?"
00:19:15,00:19:18,"- Yeah, yeah, and he's sort of is able"
00:19:18,00:19:20,"to withstand these things, hence this people doing it."
00:19:20,00:19:22,"It's been, it's had a lot of controversy about it"
00:19:22,00:19:25,"in recent times, 'cause a lot of people have either died"
00:19:25,00:19:27,"or become ill off the back of it, but he can do it."
00:19:27,00:19:29,He demonstrably can do it.
00:19:29,00:19:30,"But according to his biographer,"
00:19:30,00:19:33,something he didn't get right was he was swimming
00:19:33,00:19:37,"in a fountain in Amsterdam and he decided on a Wim,"
00:19:37,00:19:41,"oh, on a Wim, to give himself an, brilliant,"
00:19:41,00:19:44,to give himself an enema on the nozzle of the jet
00:19:44,00:19:45,in the fountain.
00:19:45,00:19:46,- What?
00:19:46,00:19:47,"- Something I believe that he might have done before,"
00:19:47,00:19:49,but what he didn't know was that earlier that day
00:19:49,00:19:52,they turned the power up on the spout itself.
00:19:52,00:19:56,"And as he sat on the nozzle, it cut through his colon"
00:19:56,00:19:59,"and his testines, they say like a water knife,"
00:19:59,00:20:01,it kind of just went into him.
00:20:01,00:20:03,"Yeah, and he had to be rushed to hospital"
00:20:03,00:20:05,"by his son, Michael."
00:20:05,00:20:06,- Why was his son there?
00:20:06,00:20:08,"- Well, they're hanging out."
00:20:08,00:20:09,"He goes, I'm gonna quick swim in the fountain."
00:20:09,00:20:13,"- I'm just gonna say, I think that there would be a clue"
00:20:13,00:20:15,that they'd upped the pressure by the fact
00:20:15,00:20:17,that the water's going miles in the air.
00:20:17,00:20:18,- Yeah.
00:20:18,00:20:20,- But it sounds to me like they upped the pressure.
00:20:20,00:20:24,The moment it came up was as his bum was in there already.
00:20:24,00:20:25,- Was it the vertical nozzle?
00:20:25,00:20:26,- Yes.
00:20:26,00:20:28,"- Was he, was he blasted into the air"
00:20:28,00:20:31,and sat in a cartoon style at the top of the fountain
00:20:31,00:20:32,for a while.
00:20:32,00:20:34,- I haven't imagined him and all his mates going
00:20:34,00:20:36,to Las Vegas and sitting at the Bellagio
00:20:36,00:20:38,as all their fountains go up.
00:20:38,00:20:39,- What you can't see in that famous scene
00:20:39,00:20:40,"at the end of ""Ocean's Eleven"""
00:20:40,00:20:42,where they're all watching the Bellagio fountains
00:20:42,00:20:43,is Wim Hof at the top of them.
00:20:43,00:20:45,(laughing)
00:20:45,00:20:46,"- But apparently when he got there,"
00:20:46,00:20:49,he's so hard this guy.
00:20:49,00:20:52,"He could go up Mount Everest in no top, in no shoes."
00:20:52,00:20:56,"In shorts, they didn't know how serious the injury was"
00:20:56,00:21:00,"because he was like, ""Ah, tis butter, internal scratch."""
00:21:00,00:21:01,- He now has a semi-colon.
00:21:01,00:21:04,(laughing)
00:21:04,00:21:06,- So it took ages until he fainted with pain.
00:21:06,00:21:09,"And then after they did all the stuff on him,"
00:21:09,00:21:11,he didn't have any antibiotics during recovery
00:21:11,00:21:12,because he's such a hard man.
00:21:12,00:21:13,- Oh yeah.
00:21:13,00:21:15,- It's not hard to disregard antibiotic
00:21:15,00:21:19,"like germ theory is real, sorry."
00:21:19,00:21:20,I've gone right off him now.
00:21:20,00:21:22,I was actually with him even in the fountain store.
00:21:22,00:21:23,"I think, okay, he's a crazy guy."
00:21:23,00:21:25,- He's trying to suppress antibiotic resistance.
00:21:25,00:21:26,That's a good thing.
00:21:26,00:21:27,- He doesn't need antibiotics.
00:21:27,00:21:28,People should never take them
00:21:28,00:21:30,unless they absolutely need them.
00:21:30,00:21:32,- I reckon Vim Hof takes like just four of them
00:21:32,00:21:34,and then doesn't take the last three.
00:21:34,00:21:36,(laughing)
00:21:36,00:21:38,He sounds like that kind of guy to me.
00:21:38,00:21:39,(laughing)
00:21:39,00:21:40,Is he still alive?
00:21:40,00:21:41,- He is.
00:21:41,00:21:42,- Yeah.
00:21:42,00:21:43,- Still good.
00:21:43,00:21:43,"- In that case, I don't think he does that."
00:21:43,00:21:44,- Still good.
00:21:44,00:21:45,(laughing)
00:21:45,00:21:46,- It wasn't everywhere.
00:21:46,00:21:47,They thought water was good for you.
00:21:47,00:21:50,"So in America, I was reading the 18th century,"
00:21:50,00:21:52,"people thought cold water,"
00:21:52,00:21:54,"if you drank cold water, you would die."
00:21:54,00:21:59,And there was a French guy visiting Philadelphia
00:21:59,00:22:02,who said that several people die each year
00:22:02,00:22:04,drinking the cold pumped water.
00:22:04,00:22:06,And so everyone's told to leave it out to warm.
00:22:06,00:22:09,And there are printed hand bills distributed everywhere
00:22:09,00:22:12,"and posters put up next to all water pumps saying,"
00:22:12,00:22:14,do not drink this straight away.
00:22:14,00:22:15,Do not drink this cold.
00:22:15,00:22:16,You must leave this to warm up.
00:22:16,00:22:19,"But he said, all these teachings are ignored."
00:22:19,00:22:22,"And so of course, there is death all over the place."
00:22:22,00:22:23,"- Again, water."
00:22:23,00:22:26,- It's just not having the experiment time
00:22:26,00:22:27,to work it out properly.
00:22:27,00:22:28,"- You just think like,"
00:22:28,00:22:31,surely one or two people drank it and didn't die.
00:22:31,00:22:31,- He thinks.
00:22:31,00:22:33,"- And people thought, what happened there?"
00:22:33,00:22:34,- No one believed him.
00:22:34,00:22:35,- No one believed him.
00:22:35,00:22:36,"- But maybe you got lucky,"
00:22:36,00:22:38,you got a random bit of warm water in there.
00:22:38,00:22:39,"'Cause I've got a tap at home,"
00:22:39,00:22:41,which is so cold that I want to die when I drink from it.
00:22:41,00:22:42,It's really bad.
00:22:42,00:22:43,- Right.
00:22:43,00:22:44,- Yeah.
00:22:44,00:22:45,"- Yeah, okay."
00:22:45,00:22:47,(laughing)
00:22:47,00:22:49,- Thank you.
00:22:49,00:22:51,Somewhere there's a fan listening to our show
00:22:51,00:22:53,who's piecing all these very micro bits
00:22:53,00:22:54,of detail.
00:22:54,00:22:55,They've got like a big board.
00:22:55,00:22:57,Tap produces cold water.
00:22:57,00:22:59,Let's sit that next.
00:22:59,00:23:01,- That's taps at home.
00:23:01,00:23:03,(laughing)
00:23:03,00:23:04,- For what?
00:23:04,00:23:06,The most boring obituary ever written.
00:23:06,00:23:08,- Just slowly piecing together who mysterious Murray is.
00:23:08,00:23:09,- That's podcasting.
00:23:09,00:23:10,"It's nice to get to know people, isn't it?"
00:23:10,00:23:11,As you listen to them.
00:23:11,00:23:12,- Oh yeah.
00:23:12,00:23:13,- We know two things about you now.
00:23:13,00:23:15,You've got very cold taps
00:23:15,00:23:16,and you piss in the shower.
00:23:16,00:23:17,That's it.
00:23:17,00:23:17,(laughing)
00:23:17,00:23:21,- Did you know that the inventor of the Brooklyn Bridge?
00:23:21,00:23:23,"I'm gonna say inventor, I mean engineer."
00:23:23,00:23:23,- Yeah.
00:23:23,00:23:26,- Like to wrap himself in a damp cold sheet.
00:23:26,00:23:29,His name was John Roebling.
00:23:29,00:23:31,- Why did you do the sheet thing?
00:23:31,00:23:32,- No further data.
00:23:32,00:23:33,- Cool.
00:23:33,00:23:34,- Cool himself down.
00:23:34,00:23:35,- Probably.
00:23:35,00:23:36,- Like people just did used to think way
00:23:36,00:23:37,for you're too hot or too cold
00:23:37,00:23:39,and that was a massive problem.
00:23:39,00:23:42,And I guess it is if you've got hypothermia
00:23:42,00:23:44,or a massive fever it is.
00:23:44,00:23:46,"But people thought like, you know,"
00:23:46,00:23:47,"if you were sick, you could make yourself colder"
00:23:47,00:23:49,or hotter and that would cure you.
00:23:49,00:23:50,- Yeah.
00:23:50,00:23:51,- Yeah.
00:23:51,00:23:52,- They didn't have cow pole.
00:23:52,00:23:53,- Yeah.
00:23:53,00:23:54,(laughing)
00:23:54,00:23:55,- I was looking at another thing
00:23:55,00:23:57,that was happening around the same time in London
00:23:57,00:24:01,and this was a man called Banks
00:24:01,00:24:04,who had a horse called Morocco
00:24:04,00:24:06,and it had shoes of silver
00:24:06,00:24:10,"and it could dance to music, count and answer questions"
00:24:10,00:24:11,and do all sorts of tricks.
00:24:11,00:24:14,And it once apparently climbed up St. Paul's Cathedral.
00:24:14,00:24:17,"It was really, really popular."
00:24:17,00:24:19,Everyone in London loved this horse
00:24:19,00:24:20,and everyone whenever it was on display
00:24:20,00:24:21,would go and see it.
00:24:21,00:24:22,And then it went to Italy
00:24:22,00:24:25,and he and the horse and the master
00:24:25,00:24:27,were both burned on charges of sorcery.
00:24:27,00:24:30,"- Oh, that's a bad tool."
00:24:30,00:24:32,(laughing)
00:24:32,00:24:34,"- It's a risky run with magic tricks in those days, isn't it?"
00:24:34,00:24:36,Either you entertain people
00:24:36,00:24:38,or you're a witch who always ends in your fox.
00:24:38,00:24:41,- Darren Brown's birth to death in New Zealand.
00:24:41,00:24:43,- One more thing about Formula One
00:24:43,00:24:47,is if you play the sound of a Formula One race
00:24:47,00:24:50,"to a Formula One driver and they're blindfolded,"
00:24:50,00:24:53,they can tell where the track is.
00:24:53,00:24:55,- What is in what corners?
00:24:55,00:24:56,They can draw you a track.
00:24:56,00:24:59,"- Well, they'll know because they know the track so well."
00:24:59,00:25:00,"So if they like, if it goes,"
00:25:00,00:25:01,(imitates sound)
00:25:01,00:25:03,and then it goes a bit quieter for a bit
00:25:03,00:25:05,and then it goes louder and then quieter and louder
00:25:05,00:25:07,"and then quieter, they'll go, that's Monza."
00:25:07,00:25:09,"- And that's without the commentary, right?"
00:25:09,00:25:10,(laughing)
00:25:10,00:25:11,- Okay.
00:25:11,00:25:11,- That's nice.
00:25:11,00:25:12,I love that there's a great thing you can watch online
00:25:12,00:25:17,where Broadway dancers will have to stand in front
00:25:17,00:25:19,"of the stage and behind them,"
00:25:19,00:25:21,someone is doing one of the dance routines
00:25:21,00:25:23,and they have to join the dance routine
00:25:23,00:25:25,only by the sound of the steps.
00:25:25,00:25:27,It's incredible and they get it right so much.
00:25:27,00:25:30,They're hearing the patterns and then they leap into it
00:25:30,00:25:30,and they match it.
00:25:30,00:25:32,"- Do you reckon, Dan, you could watch the three of us"
00:25:32,00:25:34,doing a podcast.
00:25:34,00:25:35,"You'll just see in our mouths moving,"
00:25:35,00:25:37,but you can't hear what we're saying.
00:25:37,00:25:39,Do you reckon you could sort of join in and jump in
00:25:39,00:25:41,at the right time and say the most sensible things?
00:25:41,00:25:43,"- Yeah, yeah, I'd be like,"
00:25:43,00:25:45,"James is right, golf is interesting actually."
00:25:45,00:25:46,- Yeah.
00:25:46,00:25:47,- Don never jumps in anyway saying
00:25:47,00:25:48,the most sensible things.
00:25:48,00:25:50,It's sort of irrelevant whether you can hear us or not.
00:25:50,00:25:52,- This is how I run my whole game on this show.
00:25:52,00:25:54,- I'm not convinced he's heard anything we've said
00:25:54,00:25:56,for the last 10 years.
00:25:56,00:25:59,- Do you know the saltiest big body of water in the world?
00:25:59,00:26:00,- Dead Sea.
00:26:00,00:26:03,"- It's not, in fact, it's this really cool thing."
00:26:03,00:26:04,So there are a couple of Antarctica
00:26:04,00:26:05,"that are the saltiest in the world,"
00:26:05,00:26:07,but you can't swim in them or anything obviously
00:26:07,00:26:09,'cause they're in Antarctica.
00:26:09,00:26:12,"But there is a place called Lake Retba in Senegal,"
00:26:12,00:26:16,which is 40% saltiness compared to Dead Sea is 34%.
00:26:16,00:26:18,"- And you know how you sink in the Dead Sea, Anna?"
00:26:18,00:26:19,We've said this before.
00:26:19,00:26:20,"- We have, I know."
00:26:20,00:26:23,"- The only passage, you reckon you might float in this"
00:26:23,00:26:23,40% out?
00:26:23,00:26:24,- I've put my tickets.
00:26:24,00:26:26,I'm going to Senegal next week.
00:26:26,00:26:27,You have to find someone else.
00:26:27,00:26:28,I must find out.
00:26:28,00:26:30,"- Wait, so what do you say 40% saltiness?"
00:26:30,00:26:31,Is it 40% salt?
00:26:31,00:26:33,"- Yeah, 40% concentration."
00:26:33,00:26:34,- Wow.
00:26:34,00:26:36,- And it's also pink.
00:26:36,00:26:37,- Oh.
00:26:37,00:26:37,"- Cool, right?"
00:26:37,00:26:38,It's double whammy.
00:26:38,00:26:40,And you can swim in it and people go and bathe in it.
00:26:40,00:26:41,- Cool.
00:26:41,00:26:44,- And it's got a special algae that makes it sort of orangey.
00:26:44,00:26:45,It's one of those ones that says it's pink
00:26:45,00:26:46,and all the photos look bright pink.
00:26:46,00:26:48,"And then you read the one blogger who says,"
00:26:48,00:26:50,I went there and everyone's enhanced their photos
00:26:50,00:26:54,"enormously, but still you can float in it, you know?"
00:26:54,00:26:54,- That's cool.
00:26:54,00:26:55,- You can walk around in it.
00:26:55,00:26:56,- Very cool.
00:26:56,00:26:57,- That's nice.
00:26:57,00:26:58,- Yeah.
00:26:58,00:26:59,"- I've been to one in, where was it?"
00:26:59,00:27:03,Maybe it was in America where like animals go in there
00:27:03,00:27:06,and then they turn to salt.
00:27:06,00:27:09,- Were they petrify or were they?
00:27:09,00:27:11,- But actually like it turns out it's a bit of a myth.
00:27:11,00:27:14,Like they die through natural causes
00:27:14,00:27:16,and then slowly the salt sort of grows on their body.
00:27:16,00:27:19,"But people say, oh, this, you know,"
00:27:19,00:27:22,pelican drank a little bit of water and they turned to salt.
00:27:22,00:27:23,That doesn't happen.
00:27:23,00:27:25,- So they still believe this stuff in America?
00:27:25,00:27:26,- It's what we've said.
00:27:26,00:27:29,"- I'm not sure anyone really believes it, but yeah."
00:27:29,00:27:32,- They believe a little mad stuff in America and in Britain.
00:27:32,00:27:34,"I mean, that wouldn't be the craziest thing, would it?"
00:27:34,00:27:35,- No.
00:27:35,00:27:36,- They believe today.
00:27:36,00:27:39,"- In fact, when I went there, there was like an overlooking"
00:27:39,00:27:42,road and you could put like your business cards there
00:27:42,00:27:43,"for some reason, people were doing it."
00:27:43,00:27:45,"And I had some fish ones, so I put them there."
00:27:45,00:27:48,So we have made our mark.
00:27:48,00:27:50,"- Right, we haven't heard from them yet."
00:27:50,00:27:51,(laughing)
00:27:51,00:27:52,- They've all turned to salt.
00:27:52,00:27:54,- Saltified.
00:27:54,00:27:56,- The wife of Lot is there.
00:27:56,00:27:58,(laughing)
00:27:58,00:28:00,- Do you know Henry VIII executed all the horses
00:28:00,00:28:01,that were too short?
00:28:01,00:28:03,- Is that like a eugenics thing?
00:28:03,00:28:04,"- Basically, yeah."
00:28:04,00:28:07,He decided that the horse stock was getting a bit shit.
00:28:07,00:28:09,"- That's early for eugenics as well, isn't it?"
00:28:09,00:28:10,- He's a pioneer.
00:28:10,00:28:12,- He is a pioneer in his day and I respect it.
00:28:12,00:28:13,(laughing)
00:28:13,00:28:16,- Finally a tick for the horrific reputation
00:28:16,00:28:17,of Henry VIII.
00:28:17,00:28:20,"- This is the actual Parliamentary Act,"
00:28:20,00:28:22,"the Breed of Horses Act, 1535."
00:28:22,00:28:25,No stallion under 15 hands was allowed to exist anymore
00:28:25,00:28:28,"and no mare under 13 hands, which is quite, you know,"
00:28:28,00:28:29,it's quite big.
00:28:29,00:28:30,"- So it's like an active thing, not just they die out,"
00:28:30,00:28:33,just that you have to actively off your horse.
00:28:33,00:28:34,- There were culls every year.
00:28:34,00:28:35,- It's terrible when you're on the part land.
00:28:35,00:28:36,You're too short.
00:28:36,00:28:37,- I would try and get around it.
00:28:37,00:28:40,"- Yeah, you would put three horses in a trench cull."
00:28:40,00:28:41,(laughing)
00:28:41,00:28:44,"- I would paint the horse with,"
00:28:44,00:28:46,is it vertical stripes or horizontal stripes?
00:28:46,00:28:47,- To make them a little taller?
00:28:47,00:28:51,"- Yeah, I wish I would carry around,"
00:28:51,00:28:52,"I would make the horse carry around a smaller horse,"
00:28:52,00:28:53,would I?
00:28:53,00:28:54,- Yeah.
00:28:54,00:28:55,- Or then you have to kill off that horse.
00:28:55,00:28:56,- Yeah.
00:28:56,00:28:58,- I would hire someone with small hands
00:28:58,00:28:59,so the horse cleared the bar.
00:28:59,00:29:00,- Yes.
00:29:00,00:29:01,- That worked?
00:29:01,00:29:02,- Maybe that's why horseshoes were invented
00:29:02,00:29:05,was little platform shoes for horses to save them.
00:29:05,00:29:07,"- They used to look like the Spice Girls, didn't they?"
00:29:07,00:29:08,- Yes.
00:29:08,00:29:11,"- Mars was quite important in early Rome, wasn't he?"
00:29:11,00:29:14,"And he was associated with woodpeckers,"
00:29:14,00:29:15,which meant that there was a law
00:29:15,00:29:18,against eating woodpeckers in ancient Rome.
00:29:18,00:29:18,- Yeah.
00:29:18,00:29:19,- It doesn't feel like a law that would impact
00:29:19,00:29:21,many people's lives too drastically.
00:29:21,00:29:22,"- Oh, they're so delicious."
00:29:22,00:29:24,(laughing)
00:29:24,00:29:26,"- For all we know, they're incredibly yummy."
00:29:26,00:29:27,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:29:27,00:29:28,I doubt it.
00:29:28,00:29:30,They've got those strong skulls to withstand all the pecking.
00:29:30,00:29:31,- They scramble themselves.
00:29:31,00:29:33,(laughing)
00:29:33,00:29:35,- I think woodpecker tongs was a thing
00:29:35,00:29:37,"for a while, people would eat woodpecker tongs."
00:29:37,00:29:38,"They're very long, aren't they?"
00:29:38,00:29:39,- They've got tongs so long
00:29:39,00:29:41,that they wrap around their brains.
00:29:41,00:29:41,"- Yeah, yes."
00:29:41,00:29:42,- It was to protect their brain in part.
00:29:42,00:29:43,- Sorry.
00:29:43,00:29:44,- I think it is.
00:29:44,00:29:45,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:29:45,00:29:46,- I thought you meant woodpecker tongs
00:29:46,00:29:47,like as a piece of cutlery
00:29:47,00:29:49,"with which you ate woodpeckers,"
00:29:49,00:29:51,"specifically like you have, you know."
00:29:51,00:29:52,(laughing)
00:29:52,00:29:53,"- No, woodpecker fork."
00:29:53,00:29:55,- Mrs. Jones is coming round
00:29:55,00:29:56,and get the woodpecker tongs.
00:29:56,00:29:58,"Oh, no, we, oh, what a faux pas."
00:29:58,00:29:59,(laughing)
00:29:59,00:30:02,"- Just annoying, unannoying car noises."
00:30:02,00:30:04,"The car horn, quite annoying now,"
00:30:04,00:30:07,used to be so much worse.
00:30:07,00:30:10,"So the word klaxon in fact comes from,"
00:30:10,00:30:11,was invented for cars.
00:30:11,00:30:12,"- Jeremy klaxon, yes."
00:30:12,00:30:13,(laughing)
00:30:13,00:30:14,- Yes.
00:30:14,00:30:15,- He invented it.
00:30:15,00:30:18,"- Oh, why hasn't he changed his name?"
00:30:18,00:30:19,He should.
00:30:19,00:30:23,"So this was sort of pre-war, pre-Second World War."
00:30:23,00:30:24,Cars had horns that were like klaxons.
00:30:24,00:30:27,"So, you know, the klaxon noise is like a woo."
00:30:27,00:30:28,- A woo-ga.
00:30:28,00:30:29,- A woo-ga.
00:30:29,00:30:29,- Yeah.
00:30:29,00:30:30,"- Yeah, it was that."
00:30:30,00:30:32,"But you, was I saying to you guys last week"
00:30:32,00:30:33,that my grandma always honked the horn
00:30:33,00:30:35,"when she turned, when she took corners?"
00:30:35,00:30:36,"Well, that used to be the rule."
00:30:36,00:30:38,"You'd be fined if you didn't,"
00:30:38,00:30:39,because there was no other way of knowing
00:30:39,00:30:41,when car engines weren't as big.
00:30:41,00:30:43,"And so they were constantly,"
00:30:43,00:30:44,"whenever anyone turned a corner,"
00:30:44,00:30:46,"when everyone was coming up to a junction,"
00:30:46,00:30:47,"whenever you were about to park,"
00:30:47,00:30:49,"you beeped your, woo-ga."
00:30:49,00:30:50,- That is annoying.
00:30:50,00:30:51,- And people hated it.
00:30:51,00:30:52,- It's kind of like the legacy
00:30:52,00:30:54,of the man with the red flag.
00:30:54,00:30:54,- Yes.
00:30:54,00:30:55,- A little bit.
00:30:55,00:30:56,"- But less annoying, the man with the red flag."
00:30:56,00:30:58,I don't think I'd mind that as much.
00:30:58,00:31:02,"It's a bit like, beep, beep, vehicle reversing."
00:31:02,00:31:05,"- So, do you know who the godfather of backing up is?"
00:31:05,00:31:07,- Like the godfather of soul.
00:31:07,00:31:08,"- Yeah, just like that."
00:31:08,00:31:12,- Do you mean the sound or literally backing up a car?
00:31:12,00:31:14,"- The sound that's made when you back up a car,"
00:31:14,00:31:16,"the beeping, when you're reversing."
00:31:16,00:31:17,"- So, who's the godfather of creating that sound?"
00:31:17,00:31:18,I don't get what you're asking.
00:31:18,00:31:20,- It's a man called Ed Peterson.
00:31:20,00:31:20,- Okay.
00:31:20,00:31:23,"- Oh, I was just about to say him."
00:31:23,00:31:24,"- So, he was the pioneer in the West,"
00:31:24,00:31:25,and he may have been beaten to it
00:31:25,00:31:29,by Matthew Saburo Yamaguchi in 1953.
00:31:29,00:31:32,"But Peterson noticed, he was working at a dam,"
00:31:32,00:31:34,"a construction project, huge construction project."
00:31:34,00:31:36,"And he noticed, gosh, people keep being killed or injured"
00:31:36,00:31:39,when really heavy vehicles reverse into them.
00:31:39,00:31:42,"If only there was some, and he said the flag men"
00:31:42,00:31:43,were just not doing their jobs.
00:31:43,00:31:45,And that was the system.
00:31:45,00:31:47,"Weirdly, the, you know, like waving flags around"
00:31:47,00:31:48,"saying, look out, someone's reversing."
00:31:48,00:31:49,That system wasn't working.
00:31:49,00:31:52,- I can't believe if you're holding a flag to wave
00:31:52,00:31:53,"and a person about to get run over,"
00:31:53,00:31:54,"why aren't you also going,"
00:31:54,00:31:56,"there's a car, it's about to run you over,"
00:31:56,00:31:58,"there's a car, quick, get out of the way."
00:31:58,00:31:59,- I don't know.
00:31:59,00:32:00,Maybe they're standing at a distance.
00:32:00,00:32:01,- Probably a union thing.
00:32:01,00:32:03,"- Yeah, a union thing."
00:32:03,00:32:05,- We won't pay them extra for that.
00:32:05,00:32:07,"- Anyway, just wanted to give him his credit."
00:32:07,00:32:08,"Ed Peterson, all right."
00:32:08,00:32:12,- Do you know who has the best car horns?
00:32:12,00:32:13,- Ooh.
00:32:13,00:32:15,- What country?
00:32:15,00:32:17,"- Oh, is there a country where it's, you know,"
00:32:17,00:32:19,"it leaps south like in ""Jukes of Huzzard""?"
00:32:19,00:32:22,♪ Ha da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da ♪
00:32:22,00:32:26,"- Ah, so you're interpreting it differently to how I mean."
00:32:26,00:32:27,- The best.
00:32:27,00:32:30,"- So, by best, it's long lasting, louder."
00:32:30,00:32:32,This is in India.
00:32:32,00:32:35,"- Yeah, it is in India, and the reason is that"
00:32:35,00:32:37,because the culture of driving there
00:32:37,00:32:40,"has a much more emphasis on the beeping when you're in,"
00:32:40,00:32:43,"and so they need cars, they actually make,"
00:32:43,00:32:46,"like Audi make stronger, better horns"
00:32:46,00:32:48,so that they don't run them down
00:32:48,00:32:50,with the amount that they're using them.
00:32:50,00:32:52,"- That is, they do use it properly in India."
00:32:52,00:32:55,"They use it to tell you, ""I'm about to drive into you."""
00:32:55,00:32:57,"- You're in danger, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:32:57,00:32:59,"- Well, that implies that incredibly bad drivers,"
00:32:59,00:33:00,"if they're always using it properly,"
00:33:00,00:33:02,but they're always using it.
00:33:02,00:33:04,- I think it's so busy traffic-wise.
00:33:04,00:33:05,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:33:05,00:33:08,- And the way to cross the road is just to get cracking.
00:33:08,00:33:12,"- It's like British Kettles, they're long lasting."
00:33:12,00:33:13,"This is personal anecdote, but--"
00:33:13,00:33:14,- British Kettles.
00:33:14,00:33:15,- British Kettles. - Best in the world.
00:33:15,00:33:17,"- Yeah, I was just confused by the analogy."
00:33:17,00:33:18,"- Well, I'm just remembering"
00:33:18,00:33:21,because Dan's wife has bought like 20 Kettles.
00:33:21,00:33:23,"- Yeah, she keeps buying European ones"
00:33:23,00:33:25,because they look nice and they keep dying
00:33:25,00:33:27,'cause they can't keep up with the British tea consuming.
00:33:27,00:33:28,- Out of the kilowatts.
00:33:28,00:33:29,"- Yeah. - It's an anecdote,"
00:33:29,00:33:30,it's just gone flooding back.
00:33:30,00:33:33,(all laughing)
00:33:33,00:33:36,- Did you come across the car that Cadillac invented
00:33:36,00:33:38,which had a working toilet in it?
00:33:38,00:33:39,- Oh.
00:33:39,00:33:40,"- Sorry, not Cadillac invented."
00:33:40,00:33:44,"One random bloke modified so that he could,"
00:33:44,00:33:45,this was a guy called Louis Matta
00:33:45,00:33:49,"and he wanted to drive 10,000 kilometers without stopping."
00:33:49,00:33:51,LA to New York and back.
00:33:51,00:33:53,"- Right, so he must have put the toilet on the driving seat."
00:33:53,00:33:54,"- He put the toilet,"
00:33:54,00:33:55,"well, there were a couple of them in the car."
00:33:55,00:33:57,- How long does it take to drive that distance?
00:33:57,00:33:59,- It must be like 10 days.
00:33:59,00:34:02,"- That would be 1,000 kilometers a day,"
00:34:02,00:34:04,"maybe a bit longer than that, I think that's quite a bit."
00:34:04,00:34:05,- Yeah.
00:34:05,00:34:09,"- He will have to stop at some stage to sleep, right?"
00:34:09,00:34:11,"- Well, no, but there were a couple of them in the car."
00:34:11,00:34:13,So they would shift into the driving seat.
00:34:13,00:34:17,"This was in 1952, for God knows why he wanted to do this."
00:34:17,00:34:20,"But he'd been in the Navy, he was an engineer"
00:34:20,00:34:22,"and it had a toilet, it had a shower,"
00:34:22,00:34:25,"it had a TV, a fridge and a sink"
00:34:25,00:34:27,and they were escorted when they were in a town
00:34:27,00:34:28,by the local police who would help them
00:34:28,00:34:29,through the traffic lights.
00:34:29,00:34:31,So they could literally keep moving for this time.
00:34:31,00:34:33,- It's just like a caravan really.
00:34:33,00:34:36,"- It's just like a caravan, except I love this."
00:34:36,00:34:38,What's another flaw in this plan?
00:34:38,00:34:41,- We have to let out what you're carrying.
00:34:41,00:34:43,- Now I assume he's got a shed load of petrol
00:34:43,00:34:44,that's filling up the car.
00:34:44,00:34:48,"- He can refuel on the go, that's cool."
00:34:48,00:34:52,"And what if the worst happens, you burst a tire,"
00:34:52,00:34:54,they had a system to change a tire
00:34:54,00:34:56,while the car was driving.
00:34:56,00:34:59,"- Wow, it's so cool, as Jack would lift up one tire"
00:34:59,00:35:01,and this tiny little supermarket trolley wheel
00:35:01,00:35:03,would take that corner of the car
00:35:03,00:35:05,and then his friends would like lean over the side
00:35:05,00:35:07,and change the tire and then change it back
00:35:07,00:35:08,and then you just pop it back up.
00:35:08,00:35:10,- You would be impossible to steer
00:35:10,00:35:13,if it's got a supermarket trolley wheel on it.
00:35:13,00:35:15,(all laughing)
00:35:15,00:35:18,- The laziest all of this bit of observational comedy
00:35:18,00:35:19,that's ever been made.
00:35:19,00:35:22,(upbeat music)
00:35:22,00:35:25,"- Okay, that's it."
00:35:25,00:35:26,That is all of our outtakes.
