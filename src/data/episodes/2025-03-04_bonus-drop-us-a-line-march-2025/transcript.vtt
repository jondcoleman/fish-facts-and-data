00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.280
 (upbeat music)

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:02.400
 - Hey, Club Fish members.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.840
 Welcome to this week's bonus bit of content.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.140
 We have got a compilation episode for you today.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.280
 But before we get into it,

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.960
 I just wanna quickly remind some of you

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.440
 who may have missed the news

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.220
 that we are going to do a live show,

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.920
 July 6th at the Crossed Wires Festival,

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.460
 which is a festival that was co-created

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.680
 by our good friend Alice Levine of My Dad Wrote a Porno.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.280
 They started last year, it was a massive success.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.320
 They're coming back this year

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.960
 and we were really excited to be invited,

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.960
 so we're gonna be doing a live recording.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.360
 Now, we didn't do Sheffield on our tour last year.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.720
 We really missed out on getting to that bit of the country.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.320
 So if you're in that area, come along.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.040
 We're doing a full live recording.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.520
 There'll be a few extra fun bits thrown in as well.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.680
 And if you wanna get tickets,

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.840
 go to nosuchthingasafish.com.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.200
 You'll find all the links there.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.120
 And why not check out what other podcasts are on.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.440
 It is genuinely a great pod festival.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.320
 All right, well, let's get to the compilation.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.960
 Here are the best of the outtakes

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.600
 that never made it to the main show.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.440
 Here we go.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.140
 (upbeat music)

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:14.560
 - She had been told the gaitnesses.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.400
 She turned up to the unveiling of the Statue of Liberty.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.240
 - Oh yeah.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.080
 - Which I really liked.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.960
 She turned that she was not invited.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.080
 But she turned up on a cattle barge.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.360
 So she turned up on a barge with a megaphone,

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.120
 shouting that it was a gigantic lie,

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.920
 a travesty and a mockery

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.240
 to make the representation of Liberty a woman

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.440
 when actual women had so few rights at the time.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.840
 So that was her, that was her prototype.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.560
 - She's shackled though, isn't she?

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.360
 - Oh, is she broken her shackles?

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.560
 - I don't think she's shackled.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.400
 - Is she not?

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.600
 - I should know, I've been up it.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.440
 And I don't know.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.160
 - Yeah, but that's what you're on the inside.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.400
 You can't see me outside, can you, from there?

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.560
 - Oh, and I haven't been up it either.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.000
 Sorry, I was missing one.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.080
 What just happened?

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.120
 I've been near it.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.000
 - Oh yeah, we all bit, we went together.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.880
 We were near it when we went to do yard.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.720
 - I've been closer than that.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.560
 - I love you.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.960
 - Yeah, yeah, but she's not, I don't think she,

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:59.800
 I'm pretty sure she's not shackled.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.640
 - I don't think she's shackled.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.080
 - I thought one of her legs had a shackle on it,

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.960
 but maybe I'm wrong.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.800
 - She's got slippers that I know that much.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:05.640
 - Slippers.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.800
 - I think they're more sandals.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.920
 - Yeah, slip-ons, like the open toad.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.240
 You could see her feet.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.080
 - Yeah.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.920
 - She's a woman in comfortable shoes.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.760
 - While you stayed outside,

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.400
 you got one of those wiki feet things going on.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.640
 (laughing)

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.200
 - So, true feminists should campaign

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.400
 for the Statue of Liberty to be a man?

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.440
 - Yeah, and yet, and yet my campaign has done nothing.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.840
 (laughing)

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.880
 - I have one more caddy called Daft Willy Gunn.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.840
 He is an old school one in Scotland.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.480
 He was from the 19th century, early 19th century.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.000
 He always wore four coats, three or four pairs of trousers.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.040
 - It is cold in Scotland.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.200
 - It is cold.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.240
 He couldn't afford like a big coat or anything,

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.280
 so he just wore like lots of small ones.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.720
 - To false economy.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.520
 (laughing)

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.960
 Spend the money on a good coat.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.360
 - He would only eat milk and soft bread rolls his whole life.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.280
 And he would be in St Andrews in Scotland.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.000
 And then when the golf season finished,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.400
 he would walk off and no one knew where he went.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.280
 He just presumably walked home somewhere.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.960
 And then when the season started, he walked back again.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:09.800
 And that was it.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.520
 - He's a really great train.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.000
 - And then one day, they stumbled upon a grave,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.760
 which said he died in 1522.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.000
 (laughing)

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.760
 - Well, one day in 1820, he walked north, never to return.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.520
 And to this day, nobody knows what happened to him.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.360
 - He's still out there.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.680
 - That's great.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.520
 - Do you know that fact?

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.840
 Have I ever said it on this?

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.720
 I don't think I have.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.080
 It was during the Winter War, I think,

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.560
 between Russia and Finland.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.840
 And there was a guy who was captured.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.760
 And it turned out that he was trying to hide in the snow

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.560
 by putting doilies on his head.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.800
 (laughing)

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.440
 And he reckoned it worked for ages

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.160
 because they were white doilies and no one could see him.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.440
 - But why had he taken so many doilies to a comfort zone?

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.960
 I said, did he just think,

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.320
 I know this is gonna work.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.000
 - I think he might have plundered them from houses.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.840
 - Really, of course, 'cause you would get doilies.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.160
 I mean, you don't get doilies anymore.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.840
 It's a really, really sad fact.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.200
 I mean, you get sort of weak doilies on trains these days,

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.760
 but even then only on nice trains, they're not very good.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.440
 - Let's make me think if you're Jewish

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.320
 and you have a Yamaha,

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.000
 do you, if you were going certain places with the army,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.200
 would you match it to your environment?

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.000
 You're going somewhere winter, where are white?

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.360
 - Like a Kamoka.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.680
 (laughing)

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.000
 - But in all these scenarios,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.040
 and in this one that you've described,

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.480
 you didn't really have to bury yourself up to the eyebrows.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.800
 - I think it was more like his hair

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.480
 would show up against the snow,

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.880
 but you maybe had a white coat.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.280
 - Did he get caught when some Russians turned up

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.760
 and thought, oh, a lovely comfy armchair.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.680
 I'll just put my left arm here.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.160
 - He doesn't put like double T on that.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.240
 (laughing)

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.240
 - Wait a minute, what's a doily doing here?

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.640
 You know what, I only half remembered the story, so.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.520
 - Wait, is a doily's for your head, isn't it?

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.880
 Is it a coaster?

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.320
 - No, a doily is the thing you put on a table

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.040
 and you put, it's a bit bigger than a coaster,

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.280
 but you put your tea pot on it.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.120
 - What am I thinking of here?

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.880
 - I think-- - I'm lazy.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.280
 - An anti-McCassar. - An anti-McCassar.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.200
 - I'm so sorry. - I think I'm an anti-McCassar.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.840
 - An anti-McCassar is the thing you don't get anymore.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.240
 I've got doily's coming out of my arse.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.120
 (laughing)

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.600
 - It's weird that they're the same material though,

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.440
 so you obviously it was material-based confusion.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.280
 Anyway. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.000
 - I don't think a doily would work as an anti-McCassar

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.960
 'cause it's got holes in it,

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.960
 so all the MacCassar juice would get on the chair.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:07.800
 - You're right.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.800
 - What's a MacCassar?

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.160
 - So MacCassar is like-- - Oh, God.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.560
 - We have gone off topic, haven't we?

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.000
 - MacCassar is hair oil that in the 19th century,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.600
 you'd have lots of, you'd slather yourself.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.560
 - Yeah, yeah. - You'd make memory.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.400
 So that's why the anti--

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.360
 - We don't need to combine this in the 19th century.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.840
 - Sorry, you popped your tiger balm in your hair.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.200
 Your anti-McCassar is when you go on the train

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.480
 or at a chair, you sit in a comfy chair,

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.000
 you need a layer of cloth between your head

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.960
 and the fabric of the chair

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.480
 so that the oil doesn't soak into the chair itself.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.920
 So that's an anti-McCassar.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.480
 James is right, a doily is the kind of coaster.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.960
 - Is that what they put on airplanes when you say--

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.120
 - Yeah, anti-McCassar. - That's an anti-McCassar.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.880
 - Should we talk about L Frank Baum? - Yeah, sure.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.680
 - I've only got anti-McCassar material.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.120
 Do you know how scientists,

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.720
 if they've got a healer monster to test its health levels,

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.800
 how they test them?

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.360
 - Okay, so I'm gonna give you a clue.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.760
 - Tremel is classic.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:56.600
 - Nice, that's good.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.240
 It's actually not to test how fit they are in a gym sense.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.320
 It's more like how many reserves do they have?

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.640
 How long do they get to last in the desert?

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.920
 - Tales of conference, 'cause that's where they keep their friends.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.120
 It's related to Archimedes.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.200
 - They put it in a bath and how much water comes out.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.040
 - It's exactly it.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.160
 They dunk their tail in a cup of water

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.600
 and then you just measure how much comes out

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.040
 and then you know how fat the tail is.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.320
 - It was a bit of an easy clue.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.440
 I'll have to, sorry about that.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.840
 But you know, I didn't want it to go on forever.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.720
 It was gonna be a fun game, was it?

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.280
 - So they are venomous, right?

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.200
 And I think only two people are recorded

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.480
 to have ever died, one last year and one in 1930.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.840
 And, but the reason they're not very dangerous

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.400
 is that they don't have a mechanism to inject their venom.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.480
 What they've got is they've got teeth with grooves in

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.400
 and they have to bite into you

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.680
 and then just chew up and down and up and down

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.560
 and up and down and flood their mouth with venom

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.520
 and chew the venom into you.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.160
 So it's quite hard for them to have a victim.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.120
 So they've got, it's very inefficient.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.080
 - I read it takes like 15 minutes.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.000
 - Well, the guy who died last year,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.400
 he'd been bitten for four minutes.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.840
 - Yeah, there was a suggestion

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.960
 that you might have had an allergic reaction.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:58.800
 - Interesting.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.760
 - Yeah, it can be quite scary, I think.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.520
 There was a 1959 movie called The Giant Healer Monster,

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:09.200
 which apparently features a Mexican bearded lizard

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.800
 instead of a healer monster.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.040
 - You wouldn't get away with that these days.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.040
 - Beard, no, exactly.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:18.000
 You have to skin an actual healer monster, don't you?

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.800
 But it was the first ever double feature film

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.600
 where you paid for one film and you got two.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.680
 - Oh, right, that's great.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.720
 - And it was the first ever film

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.520
 that was shot and produced in Dallas.

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.280
 - Really? - Wow.

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.440
 - But the double feature that you got

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.200
 was the giant healer monster.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.120
 And the other one was called The Killer Shrews.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.080
 - Oh, wow.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.400
 Which one, headlines?

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.040
 - I mean, it's gotta be a double headline now.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.520
 - It is a double headline.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.440
 Yeah, I watched the trailer for the Healer Monster movie.

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.760
 It's wild, it's wonderful.

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:54.600
 Actually, I lie, I watched it for the remake in 2012,

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.320
 simply called Healer with an exclamation mark.

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.280
 - Yeah, it's unbelievable these things get remade.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.160
 It was at the time acknowledged as an unbelievably bad film.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.280
 Who's remaking it?

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.600
 - So what, and it's as bad?

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.360
 - Did they not remake The Killer Shrews?

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.920
 - Oh, I didn't check that, I should have.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.280
 - It's in development help, yeah, yeah.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.880
 - Just on strong materials.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:14.920
 This is the stiffest material.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:15.840
 It's all about the hardest.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.000
 There's also the strongest,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.040
 and that's like how much can you hang off something,

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:19.960
 basically.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.760
 Strongest natural material, thought for ages and ages.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:23.600
 - Spider silk?

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:27.280
 - Spider silk, spider silk.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.120
 - Wow.

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:33.120
 - I can just imagine Anna as the host of University Challenge.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:36.000
 Someone gets an answer like, "Oh, wow, isn't it?

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.120
 "The Chilling Milton, oh."

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.320
 - Well, I've always been so skeptical about this,

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.640
 and I know scientists have always claimed it,

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.320
 but I've just passed so many spiders webs,

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.080
 and often I pull at them and they break.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.440
 - You're unbelievably strong, Anna.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.440
 - I am, I am.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.280
 - You're like Godzilla.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.120
 - I'm Hercules, yes.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.080
 - Friend of the flies, Anna Tijinski.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.800
 - I liberate them.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.040
 I get it, it's pound for pound, they're very thin,

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.600
 but it seems so unlikely.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.920
 And anyway, they've been supplanted recently,

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.720
 and I believe this much more.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.200
 - They always say ants are really strong,

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.760
 but I just stand on them and they're fucking squished.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:12.480
 - It's like I don't understand proportionality.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.040
 Anyway, it was recently found

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.200
 that the strongest material is limpid teeth.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.720
 So you know limpids, like the common limpid

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.520
 that you see on beaches?

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.040
 Their teeth, they're actually on their tongue,

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:23.440
 like we were talking about a bit earlier with mollusks.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.720
 They've got this tongue,

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.440
 and they use it for the same purpose as parrotfish,

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.480
 which is just a scrape algae off the rocks.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:31.960
 And apparently the comparison

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.680
 is a single string of spaghetti holding,

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:39.000
 the scientists said 3,500 kilogram bags of sugar,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.400
 which I didn't think was that good a comparison.

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:45.440
 So I'm deciding to say it's like a string of spaghetti

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.800
 holding a large walrus,

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.320
 or my car with five adults inside, if you know my car.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.160
 - Wow.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:52.000
 - I know your car.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:52.840
 - Yeah, I know your car.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:53.680
 - They imagine that with five adults.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:54.520
 - It's not like the small,

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:56.880
 it's a normal, small-ish size car, right?

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:57.720
 - It's a sco de fab, yeah.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:58.560
 - Yeah.

00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:59.880
 - I'm not ashamed to say it.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.960
 (all laughing)

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:02.800
 - That's amazing.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.040
 - Cut spaghetti?

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.840
 - I think it doesn't matter

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:09.160
 'cause it's about the width of it.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.000
 - It doesn't matter.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 - You've been trying this Italian restaurant.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.440
 (all laughing)

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:13.520
 - It's a nightmare.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:17.760
 - It's really hard to turn it around at four,

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:18.600
 'cause of it.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.440
 (all laughing)

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.080
 - It's al dente.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.160
 (all laughing)

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.400
 - I'll tell you one last,

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.960
 this is an alternative actually to a Zempig,

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.440
 'cause you know, others are available,

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.880
 but much better, Vibes.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.040
 - Oh, okay.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.480
 - Which is an acronym that stands for

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:38.000
 the Vibrating Ingestible Bioelectric Simulator.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:38.840
 - Okay.

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.920
 - And it is a pill that you swallow

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.680
 that wiggles and tickles and jiggles inside you

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.600
 and makes you think you're full.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.480
 It's called, like, it's a battery,

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.040
 a motor, a little vibrating motor,

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.440
 and a membrane, and when you swallow it,

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:53.280
 the membrane dissolves.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.080
 - You know what it sounds like to me, Andy?

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:58.320
 - A magic bean, and I've got a lot to sell you.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.840
 (all laughing)

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.920
 - And well, it's been tested in the last couple of years,

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.600
 in 2023, it's been tested on pigs,

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.960
 hasn't got to human trials yet,

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.640
 but they ate 40% less.

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:09.320
 - And pigs love to eat, like, they're overweight.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.160
 - They love to eat,

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.520
 and it's been tested on young Yorkshire pigs, apparently.

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:13.840
 (all laughing)

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.640
 It basically means that your stomach

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.680
 has been jiggled around and it thinks,

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.000
 oh, there must be loads of food in here.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:19.840
 - Really?

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:20.680
 - And then, yeah.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.040
 - Wow, but then what do I have to eat

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:23.560
 to get rid of that thing?

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:24.400
 - You just eat another one,

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:25.680
 and then push it the first one through, that's fine.

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.800
 - Right, okay, and then just eat a big one and a big one.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.320
 - Wow, what a weird poo that will feel like,

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.160
 'cause it's vibrating out your butt.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.800
 (all laughing)

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.200
 - Here's an interesting thing,

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.240
 avalanches are not nearly as deadly as they used to be,

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.080
 and more than half of people who are stuck

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.760
 in avalanches survive these days.

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:43.600
 - Wow.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:47.240
 - Yeah, and they've got loads of new survival devices

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.320
 that you can have that if you're skiing off-piste,

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.240
 you might have them with you.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.720
 - One of them, which is really cool,

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:57.240
 is a thing called the avalanche airbag system,

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.200
 and what you do is when you're skiing

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.420
 and you see an avalanche coming,

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:03.240
 you go, oh, shit, and you pull a toggle,

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:06.000
 and it just puts an airbag around you

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.640
 like you're in a car, like you're in a sob,

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:09.720
 but it makes you massive.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:13.160
 It puts this huge airbag around you,

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.880
 and can you guess how it works?

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.480
 This is really amazing.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:18.520
 - Is it something to do with pressure up in the mountains?

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.120
 Well, how it's inflating?

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:22.880
 - So you know when you get muesli, for instance,

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.200
 you get a big box of muesli,

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:27.280
 and at the top are all like the big nuts and stuff,

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.400
 but at the bottom are all the little grainy bits

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.240
 that you don't really want to eat.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.280
 - Yeah, this effect has got a name, this effect.

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.880
 - Yeah, it's called like the Brazil nut effect

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.040
 or something like that.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:36.200
 Well, this makes you really big,

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.200
 and so when the avalanche is coming down,

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.440
 like a Brazil nut, you float to the top

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:43.640
 and all the small bits of snow go to the bottom.

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:44.480
 - Wow.

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:45.320
 - Isn't that amazing?

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.520
 It's called the principle of inverse segregation.

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:48.360
 - Wow.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.400
 - And so it keeps you near the top,

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:51.200
 and it makes you easier to find.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.040
 - And while you're waiting,

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:53.840
 you've got all that muesli to get you to buy.

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.400
 (laughing)

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.400
 - Have many people done that on purpose?

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.680
 'Cause I'd imagine it would be tempting.

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:02.440
 - It's been used in Europe for over 10 years.

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.200
 - No, sorry, as in for fun.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.040
 - Oh, for fun?

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:05.880
 - 'Cause you would have thought

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:06.840
 that would be unbelievably good fun.

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.200
 - It feels like avalanche chasers

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.200
 are gonna be a thing, right?

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.840
 Like tornado hunters.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.200
 - Yeah, like surfing on the top of an avalanche

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.360
 in your big bubble, how great would that be?

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.560
 - I'm gonna say don't try it at home anyway.

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:18.400
 - You can't.

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:21.160
 (laughing)

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.880
 - Do you know the most famous frostbite sufferer

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.040
 of all time?

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.120
 - Randall Fiennes.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:25.960
 - Yeah, I would have said him.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.840
 - More famous, even more famous than Randall Fiennes.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.000
 - Brian Blessed.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.120
 - Think more famous.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:31.160
 - Barack Obama.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.000
 - More famous.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:32.840
 - David Asenborough.

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:33.680
 - God.

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:34.520
 - Albert Einstein.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:35.360
 - Joey Essex.

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.200
 - God.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.040
 - God?

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:37.880
 - There was a study in 2004

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:39.640
 by a couple of neo-intelligence

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:40.760
 who decreed that the baby--

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:42.960
 - Sorry, Joey Essex came at the end.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:43.800
 (laughing)

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:44.640
 - Just about to think

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:46.120
 of the most famous person I could think of.

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:47.680
 - The study found that the baby Jesus

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:50.000
 almost certainly had hypothermia as a baby.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.760
 - Oh, and then by extension.

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:52.600
 - No?

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:53.440
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.280
 - Not God, God.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.840
 - Well, now he is one of the three gods

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:57.200
 that's a kid that makes a god.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.040
 - Well, it depends which one you find.

00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:59.680
 - Basically, they looked at a load of,

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:02.120
 they looked at a load of old masters paintings

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.120
 from the National Gallery,

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.400
 which loads of them are feature of--

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.560
 - Oh, and of course they were painted life, weren't they?

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.640
 (laughing)

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:11.760
 There was like, there was an ox and an ass

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.920
 and three shepherds and a load of fucking painters

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:15.360
 in the car, wasn't there?

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.200
 - But you never see them.

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:18.920
 It's like a press gallery, you know.

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:21.320
 So yeah, 90% of these paintings depicted Jesus

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:22.760
 as either naked or scantily clad.

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:24.200
 And given that the temperature in Bethlehem

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.440
 in late December is about seven Celsius,

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.720
 like, and 60% of the paintings, he's on the floor.

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:29.920
 You think, why have you put the baby on the floor?

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:30.760
 Don't put the baby on the floor.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.320
 - He wasn't born on Christmas Day though.

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.720
 I know that according to the rules he was,

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:37.120
 but I think we don't think he was.

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:40.000
 - No, okay, but either way, it's clearly a risk.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.240
 And they said that the,

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:43.000
 can you guess the explanation they provided?

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.440
 I really like this as to why it might have been all right.

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.280
 'Cause he was God.

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:47.680
 - Why he survived it.

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.720
 - Maybe the halo warmed him up.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:53.040
 - They said maybe the halo suggested a neutral thermal zone.

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:54.560
 - Yes, very.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.200
 - Like ready-brek makes you glow in the dark.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.280
 - Yeah, exactly, yeah.

00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:59.120
 - Sorry.

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.880
 - Oh, you're too young to remember those adverts

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:02.720
 from the 1980s.

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.320
 Like a kid would eat the ready-brek

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.400
 and then they would go to school

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.560
 and they would just have a glow around them all day.

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:09.720
 - It was a few, it sort of looks a bit nuclear,

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:10.560
 doesn't it?

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:11.400
 - It does now you think about it, yeah.

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.680
 - And it was the 80s, it was a time of anxiety.

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:14.720
 - Surprised it worked.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.200
 - That's why porridge is now so much more popular

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:17.040
 than ready-brek.

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:18.160
 - Yeah.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.440
 - You're out and it's cold and it's really cold

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:21.280
 and you're in big trouble.

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:22.560
 You're riding your horse along, yeah.

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:23.400
 - Oh, okay.

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.360
 I was on the night out in Leeds in my head

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:28.200
 and now I'm, well, you can still be on the night out in Leeds.

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.440
 - These are the bar with Joey Essex.

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.360
 Buying beers for everyone.

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.400
 - I just remember that's the coldest I've ever been

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.640
 after a night out in Leeds.

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:36.640
 So that's where I am.

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:37.460
 - Okay, go on.

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:38.300
 - But you're on your horse.

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:39.140
 - I'm on my horse.

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:40.600
 - You're on your way home, back to the premier Inn.

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:41.600
 - Premier Inn, yeah.

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:44.760
 - There's no room at the premier Inn.

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.880
 (laughing)

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.640
 Outside there's a baby who's been put on the floor,

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:49.800
 which is a very bad idea.

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.320
 - Okay.

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.600
 - Your horse dies under you.

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:53.440
 - Oh, your horse died.

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:54.280
 - On your way back to the premier Inn.

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.400
 - Probably punched by a Leeds United fan.

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:58.600
 Over my head.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.480
 It's really cold.

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:02.880
 It's a long way to go to the premier Inn.

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:03.720
 - Yeah.

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:04.560
 - What do you do?

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:05.520
 - Well, I would have walked.

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:07.720
 - Oh, you do the Leen under camp here thing.

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.680
 - You can't open your horse and sleep inside.

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:10.520
 - Exactly.

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:11.360
 - Oh, I see.

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:12.200
 - Oh.

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.020
 - Wait, is that a klaxon?

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:13.860
 - It's not really.

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:16.800
 It has been done once at least that we know of

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:19.560
 by a missionary in America who in 1860,

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:20.400
 he did lose a leg.

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:21.560
 He had to have leg amputated.

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:22.400
 - Okay.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:23.240
 - But he did survive.

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.120
 But I was reading, do you remember the bit in Star Wars

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:29.400
 where Luke Skywalker has to cut open his big fluffy,

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:30.480
 no, his sort of pack animal.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:31.320
 - That's right.

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:32.600
 - And then he gets shoved in it.

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:33.840
 - Okay.

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:35.840
 - But I read an article saying it wouldn't work.

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:36.880
 You would really don't have long

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:38.480
 even if you cut open your horse and get it.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.320
 - Hang on, are you saying it would work?

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.200
 So it's how one person's done it and achieved it,

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.040
 but broadly--

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:43.580
 - You couldn't do it overnight.

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:45.520
 - It must depend how cold it is.

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:47.940
 'Cause if it's like, let's say it's 10 degrees,

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:48.780
 it's a bit nippy.

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:50.060
 (all laughing)

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:51.900
 Probably you can cut open your horse

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:53.560
 and it'll just give you enough wax to keep--

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:54.400
 - That would be fine.

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.720
 - That headline then becomes, was this necessary?

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:59.600
 (all laughing)

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:02.140
 - There's a taboo against pointing at rainbows

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:03.100
 from around the world.

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:04.820
 Lots of different cultures have this.

00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:08.640
 The Mizo of Myanmar, they think that if you point

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:10.540
 at a rainbow, you have to immediately point

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:14.620
 at a hen's basket to stop having some bad luck.

00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:17.540
 In Malayang region of Papua New Guinea,

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:20.180
 if a child accidentally points at a rainbow,

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:21.980
 they must go and find an old man

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:24.300
 (all laughing)

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:25.860
 and pull his finger.

00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:28.440
 (all laughing)

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:35.660
 - Accidently, if you accidentally point at a rainbow,

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:37.440
 it just feels so unlikely that you'll--

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:38.280
 (all laughing)

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:40.680
 - It does, and there's a group in Ecuador

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:44.180
 that if you point at a rainbow, your shoulder will ache.

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:46.340
 And in the Ivory Coast, there's a group where

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:50.540
 if you're twins and one of you points at a rainbow,

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:53.820
 then you must apply crushed mushrooms to your face.

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:55.340
 - Oh, you wouldn't like that?

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:58.040
 - No, and the idea is basically rainbows,

00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:00.980
 like to us, they're like happy unicorns, rainbows and stuff,

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:04.100
 but to a lot of people, they're otherworldly weird things

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:05.860
 and pointing is always bad, really.

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:07.800
 You shouldn't point at people or things.

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.340
 - Right. - Yeah.

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:11.080
 - If you do point at a rainbow for long enough,

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:12.640
 you will get a sore shoulder.

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:16.440
 - That's true, they're quite ephemeral things, though.

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:18.360
 - I think that you're right, they almost never last long enough

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:19.880
 that you'd get a sore shoulder by pointing.

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:23.080
 - Does the culture that has pulling an old man's finger

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:26.600
 have the same thing that we have when you pull it?

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:30.800
 - I did look and I don't (all laughing)

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:34.480
 I mean, we shouldn't laugh at these things,

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:37.380
 but I mean, 'cause it's people and like it's old, you know.

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.720
 - It's actually, yeah, it's incredibly serious.

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:40.900
 - It's serious, yeah.

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:44.020
 - But it is, that is objectively funny.

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:44.860
 - It is.

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:46.740
 You know, one person who can withstand

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:49.260
 these extraordinary cold temperatures

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.380
 and he's become quite famous, Wim Hof,

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:52.940
 I don't know if anyone's read that book.

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:53.780
 - Yeah, the method.

00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:55.340
 - The method, Wim Hof method.

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:58.620
 So he climbed to an altitude of 7,200 meters

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:01.380
 on Mount Everest wearing nothing but shorts and shoes.

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:03.340
 At one point he had to change to some boots,

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:05.480
 but that was it that he put on.

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:08.680
 He also completed a marathon above the Arctic Circle

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:11.000
 in Finland at close to minus 20,

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.240
 dressed in nothing but shorts as well.

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:15.640
 Is it a pretty, what, tops off?

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:18.040
 - Yeah, yeah, and he's sort of is able

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:20.400
 to withstand these things, hence this people doing it.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.280
 It's been, it's had a lot of controversy about it

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:25.160
 in recent times, 'cause a lot of people have either died

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:27.760
 or become ill off the back of it, but he can do it.

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:29.480
 He demonstrably can do it.

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:30.920
 But according to his biographer,

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.580
 something he didn't get right was he was swimming

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:37.460
 in a fountain in Amsterdam and he decided on a Wim,

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:41.220
 oh, on a Wim, to give himself an, brilliant,

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:44.500
 to give himself an enema on the nozzle of the jet

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:45.340
 in the fountain.

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:46.180
 - What?

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:47.700
 - Something I believe that he might have done before,

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:49.940
 but what he didn't know was that earlier that day

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:52.820
 they turned the power up on the spout itself.

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:56.380
 And as he sat on the nozzle, it cut through his colon

00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:59.220
 and his testines, they say like a water knife,

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:01.120
 it kind of just went into him.

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:03.440
 Yeah, and he had to be rushed to hospital

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:05.120
 by his son, Michael.

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.960
 - Why was his son there?

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:08.400
 - Well, they're hanging out.

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.720
 He goes, I'm gonna quick swim in the fountain.

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:13.000
 - I'm just gonna say, I think that there would be a clue

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.240
 that they'd upped the pressure by the fact

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:17.280
 that the water's going miles in the air.

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:18.120
 - Yeah.

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:20.200
 - But it sounds to me like they upped the pressure.

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:24.240
 The moment it came up was as his bum was in there already.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.760
 - Was it the vertical nozzle?

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:26.600
 - Yes.

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:28.520
 - Was he, was he blasted into the air

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:31.160
 and sat in a cartoon style at the top of the fountain

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.160
 for a while.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:34.180
 - I haven't imagined him and all his mates going

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:36.260
 to Las Vegas and sitting at the Bellagio

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:38.220
 as all their fountains go up.

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:39.620
 - What you can't see in that famous scene

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:40.620
 at the end of "Ocean's Eleven"

00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:42.300
 where they're all watching the Bellagio fountains

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:43.740
 is Wim Hof at the top of them.

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:45.300
 (laughing)

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:46.580
 - But apparently when he got there,

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:49.180
 he's so hard this guy.

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:52.940
 He could go up Mount Everest in no top, in no shoes.

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:56.460
 In shorts, they didn't know how serious the injury was

00:20:56.460 --> 00:21:00.520
 because he was like, "Ah, tis butter, internal scratch."

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:01.920
 - He now has a semi-colon.

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:04.560
 (laughing)

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:06.640
 - So it took ages until he fainted with pain.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:09.000
 And then after they did all the stuff on him,

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.160
 he didn't have any antibiotics during recovery

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:12.920
 because he's such a hard man.

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:13.760
 - Oh yeah.

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:15.980
 - It's not hard to disregard antibiotic

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:19.040
 like germ theory is real, sorry.

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.200
 I've gone right off him now.

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:22.120
 I was actually with him even in the fountain store.

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:23.840
 I think, okay, he's a crazy guy.

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:25.320
 - He's trying to suppress antibiotic resistance.

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:26.160
 That's a good thing.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.180
 - He doesn't need antibiotics.

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:28.500
 People should never take them

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:30.120
 unless they absolutely need them.

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.740
 - I reckon Vim Hof takes like just four of them

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:34.360
 and then doesn't take the last three.

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.300
 (laughing)

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:38.100
 He sounds like that kind of guy to me.

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:39.660
 (laughing)

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:40.500
 Is he still alive?

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:41.340
 - He is.

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:42.180
 - Yeah.

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:43.000
 - Still good.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:43.840
 - In that case, I don't think he does that.

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:44.680
 - Still good.

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:45.520
 (laughing)

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:46.360
 - It wasn't everywhere.

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:47.200
 They thought water was good for you.

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:50.820
 So in America, I was reading the 18th century,

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:52.100
 people thought cold water,

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:54.020
 if you drank cold water, you would die.

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:59.020
 And there was a French guy visiting Philadelphia

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:02.060
 who said that several people die each year

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:04.360
 drinking the cold pumped water.

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:06.280
 And so everyone's told to leave it out to warm.

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:09.260
 And there are printed hand bills distributed everywhere

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:12.500
 and posters put up next to all water pumps saying,

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:14.140
 do not drink this straight away.

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:15.540
 Do not drink this cold.

00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:16.980
 You must leave this to warm up.

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:19.660
 But he said, all these teachings are ignored.

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:22.700
 And so of course, there is death all over the place.

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:23.540
 - Again, water.

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:26.980
 - It's just not having the experiment time

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:27.820
 to work it out properly.

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:28.660
 - You just think like,

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:31.060
 surely one or two people drank it and didn't die.

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:31.900
 - He thinks.

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:33.900
 - And people thought, what happened there?

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:34.980
 - No one believed him.

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:35.820
 - No one believed him.

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:36.660
 - But maybe you got lucky,

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:38.620
 you got a random bit of warm water in there.

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:39.540
 'Cause I've got a tap at home,

00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:41.900
 which is so cold that I want to die when I drink from it.

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:42.740
 It's really bad.

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:43.580
 - Right.

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:44.420
 - Yeah.

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:45.260
 - Yeah, okay.

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:47.820
 (laughing)

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:49.540
 - Thank you.

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:51.380
 Somewhere there's a fan listening to our show

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:53.260
 who's piecing all these very micro bits

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:54.100
 of detail.

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:55.740
 They've got like a big board.

00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:57.620
 Tap produces cold water.

00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:59.540
 Let's sit that next.

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:01.060
 - That's taps at home.

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:03.220
 (laughing)

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:04.060
 - For what?

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:06.020
 The most boring obituary ever written.

00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:08.700
 - Just slowly piecing together who mysterious Murray is.

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:09.540
 - That's podcasting.

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:10.580
 It's nice to get to know people, isn't it?

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:11.420
 As you listen to them.

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:12.260
 - Oh yeah.

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:13.660
 - We know two things about you now.

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:15.140
 You've got very cold taps

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:16.180
 and you piss in the shower.

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:17.020
 That's it.

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:17.980
 (laughing)

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:21.540
 - Did you know that the inventor of the Brooklyn Bridge?

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:23.060
 I'm gonna say inventor, I mean engineer.

00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:23.900
 - Yeah.

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:26.240
 - Like to wrap himself in a damp cold sheet.

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:29.100
 His name was John Roebling.

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.060
 - Why did you do the sheet thing?

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:32.260
 - No further data.

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:33.100
 - Cool.

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:34.420
 - Cool himself down.

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:35.260
 - Probably.

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:36.540
 - Like people just did used to think way

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:37.940
 for you're too hot or too cold

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:39.140
 and that was a massive problem.

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:42.300
 And I guess it is if you've got hypothermia

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:44.100
 or a massive fever it is.

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:46.020
 But people thought like, you know,

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:47.980
 if you were sick, you could make yourself colder

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:49.340
 or hotter and that would cure you.

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:50.180
 - Yeah.

00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:51.020
 - Yeah.

00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:52.260
 - They didn't have cow pole.

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:53.100
 - Yeah.

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:54.780
 (laughing)

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:55.940
 - I was looking at another thing

00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:57.900
 that was happening around the same time in London

00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:01.020
 and this was a man called Banks

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:04.580
 who had a horse called Morocco

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:06.580
 and it had shoes of silver

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:10.340
 and it could dance to music, count and answer questions

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:11.620
 and do all sorts of tricks.

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:14.620
 And it once apparently climbed up St. Paul's Cathedral.

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:17.100
 It was really, really popular.

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:19.020
 Everyone in London loved this horse

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:20.700
 and everyone whenever it was on display

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:21.580
 would go and see it.

00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:22.780
 And then it went to Italy

00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:25.100
 and he and the horse and the master

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:27.580
 were both burned on charges of sorcery.

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:30.900
 - Oh, that's a bad tool.

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:32.140
 (laughing)

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:34.780
 - It's a risky run with magic tricks in those days, isn't it?

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:36.100
 Either you entertain people

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:38.540
 or you're a witch who always ends in your fox.

00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:41.980
 - Darren Brown's birth to death in New Zealand.

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:43.300
 - One more thing about Formula One

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:47.260
 is if you play the sound of a Formula One race

00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:50.940
 to a Formula One driver and they're blindfolded,

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:53.900
 they can tell where the track is.

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:55.300
 - What is in what corners?

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:56.620
 They can draw you a track.

00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:59.540
 - Well, they'll know because they know the track so well.

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:00.980
 So if they like, if it goes,

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:01.980
 (imitates sound)

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:03.580
 and then it goes a bit quieter for a bit

00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:05.780
 and then it goes louder and then quieter and louder

00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:07.500
 and then quieter, they'll go, that's Monza.

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:09.340
 - And that's without the commentary, right?

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:10.180
 (laughing)

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:11.020
 - Okay.

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:11.860
 - That's nice.

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:12.980
 I love that there's a great thing you can watch online

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:17.820
 where Broadway dancers will have to stand in front

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:19.300
 of the stage and behind them,

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:21.460
 someone is doing one of the dance routines

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:23.100
 and they have to join the dance routine

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:25.100
 only by the sound of the steps.

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:27.700
 It's incredible and they get it right so much.

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:30.020
 They're hearing the patterns and then they leap into it

00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:30.860
 and they match it.

00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:32.980
 - Do you reckon, Dan, you could watch the three of us

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:34.060
 doing a podcast.

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:35.340
 You'll just see in our mouths moving,

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:37.220
 but you can't hear what we're saying.

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:39.300
 Do you reckon you could sort of join in and jump in

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:41.860
 at the right time and say the most sensible things?

00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:43.100
 - Yeah, yeah, I'd be like,

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:45.620
 James is right, golf is interesting actually.

00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:46.460
 - Yeah.

00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:47.300
 - Don never jumps in anyway saying

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:48.300
 the most sensible things.

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:50.220
 It's sort of irrelevant whether you can hear us or not.

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:52.860
 - This is how I run my whole game on this show.

00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:54.220
 - I'm not convinced he's heard anything we've said

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:56.260
 for the last 10 years.

00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:59.300
 - Do you know the saltiest big body of water in the world?

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:00.640
 - Dead Sea.

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:03.260
 - It's not, in fact, it's this really cool thing.

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:04.580
 So there are a couple of Antarctica

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:05.740
 that are the saltiest in the world,

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:07.820
 but you can't swim in them or anything obviously

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:09.020
 'cause they're in Antarctica.

00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:12.260
 But there is a place called Lake Retba in Senegal,

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:16.580
 which is 40% saltiness compared to Dead Sea is 34%.

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:18.820
 - And you know how you sink in the Dead Sea, Anna?

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:19.740
 We've said this before.

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:20.580
 - We have, I know.

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:23.060
 - The only passage, you reckon you might float in this

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:23.900
 40% out?

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:24.820
 - I've put my tickets.

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:26.140
 I'm going to Senegal next week.

00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:27.140
 You have to find someone else.

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:28.740
 I must find out.

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:30.140
 - Wait, so what do you say 40% saltiness?

00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:31.980
 Is it 40% salt?

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:33.580
 - Yeah, 40% concentration.

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:34.700
 - Wow.

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:36.240
 - And it's also pink.

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:37.080
 - Oh.

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:37.920
 - Cool, right?

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:38.820
 It's double whammy.

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:40.700
 And you can swim in it and people go and bathe in it.

00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:41.540
 - Cool.

00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:44.260
 - And it's got a special algae that makes it sort of orangey.

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:45.540
 It's one of those ones that says it's pink

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:46.860
 and all the photos look bright pink.

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:48.580
 And then you read the one blogger who says,

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:50.460
 I went there and everyone's enhanced their photos

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:54.140
 enormously, but still you can float in it, you know?

00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:54.980
 - That's cool.

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:55.820
 - You can walk around in it.

00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:56.660
 - Very cool.

00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:57.500
 - That's nice.

00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:58.340
 - Yeah.

00:26:58.340 --> 00:26:59.740
 - I've been to one in, where was it?

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:03.660
 Maybe it was in America where like animals go in there

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:06.300
 and then they turn to salt.

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:09.020
 - Were they petrify or were they?

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:11.740
 - But actually like it turns out it's a bit of a myth.

00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:14.380
 Like they die through natural causes

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:16.940
 and then slowly the salt sort of grows on their body.

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:19.460
 But people say, oh, this, you know,

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:22.500
 pelican drank a little bit of water and they turned to salt.

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:23.340
 That doesn't happen.

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:25.220
 - So they still believe this stuff in America?

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:26.260
 - It's what we've said.

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:29.220
 - I'm not sure anyone really believes it, but yeah.

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:32.060
 - They believe a little mad stuff in America and in Britain.

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:34.380
 I mean, that wouldn't be the craziest thing, would it?

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:35.220
 - No.

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:36.060
 - They believe today.

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:39.140
 - In fact, when I went there, there was like an overlooking

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:42.300
 road and you could put like your business cards there

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:43.580
 for some reason, people were doing it.

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:45.580
 And I had some fish ones, so I put them there.

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:48.300
 So we have made our mark.

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:50.300
 - Right, we haven't heard from them yet.

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:51.620
 (laughing)

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:52.620
 - They've all turned to salt.

00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:54.460
 - Saltified.

00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:56.140
 - The wife of Lot is there.

00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:58.220
 (laughing)

00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:00.100
 - Do you know Henry VIII executed all the horses

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:01.780
 that were too short?

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:03.620
 - Is that like a eugenics thing?

00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:04.460
 - Basically, yeah.

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:07.020
 He decided that the horse stock was getting a bit shit.

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:09.220
 - That's early for eugenics as well, isn't it?

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:10.060
 - He's a pioneer.

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:12.340
 - He is a pioneer in his day and I respect it.

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:13.620
 (laughing)

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:16.460
 - Finally a tick for the horrific reputation

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:17.300
 of Henry VIII.

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:20.420
 - This is the actual Parliamentary Act,

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:22.380
 the Breed of Horses Act, 1535.

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:25.500
 No stallion under 15 hands was allowed to exist anymore

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:28.620
 and no mare under 13 hands, which is quite, you know,

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:29.460
 it's quite big.

00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:30.900
 - So it's like an active thing, not just they die out,

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:33.500
 just that you have to actively off your horse.

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:34.580
 - There were culls every year.

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:35.980
 - It's terrible when you're on the part land.

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:36.820
 You're too short.

00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:37.740
 - I would try and get around it.

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:40.060
 - Yeah, you would put three horses in a trench cull.

00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:41.900
 (laughing)

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:44.260
 - I would paint the horse with,

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:46.180
 is it vertical stripes or horizontal stripes?

00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:47.500
 - To make them a little taller?

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:51.100
 - Yeah, I wish I would carry around,

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:52.660
 I would make the horse carry around a smaller horse,

00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:53.500
 would I?

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:54.340
 - Yeah.

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:55.580
 - Or then you have to kill off that horse.

00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:56.420
 - Yeah.

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:58.180
 - I would hire someone with small hands

00:28:58.180 --> 00:28:59.780
 so the horse cleared the bar.

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:00.620
 - Yes.

00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:01.460
 - That worked?

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:02.700
 - Maybe that's why horseshoes were invented

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:05.500
 was little platform shoes for horses to save them.

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:07.180
 - They used to look like the Spice Girls, didn't they?

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:08.520
 - Yes.

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:11.300
 - Mars was quite important in early Rome, wasn't he?

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:14.020
 And he was associated with woodpeckers,

00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:15.580
 which meant that there was a law

00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:18.100
 against eating woodpeckers in ancient Rome.

00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:18.940
 - Yeah.

00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:19.860
 - It doesn't feel like a law that would impact

00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:21.180
 many people's lives too drastically.

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:22.180
 - Oh, they're so delicious.

00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:24.020
 (laughing)

00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:26.500
 - For all we know, they're incredibly yummy.

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:27.820
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:28.660
 I doubt it.

00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:30.660
 They've got those strong skulls to withstand all the pecking.

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:31.940
 - They scramble themselves.

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:33.580
 (laughing)

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:35.500
 - I think woodpecker tongs was a thing

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:37.460
 for a while, people would eat woodpecker tongs.

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:38.460
 They're very long, aren't they?

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:39.940
 - They've got tongs so long

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:41.140
 that they wrap around their brains.

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:41.980
 - Yeah, yes.

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:42.820
 - It was to protect their brain in part.

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:43.660
 - Sorry.

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:44.500
 - I think it is.

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:45.340
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:46.900
 - I thought you meant woodpecker tongs

00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:47.980
 like as a piece of cutlery

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:49.340
 with which you ate woodpeckers,

00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:51.300
 specifically like you have, you know.

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:52.140
 (laughing)

00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:53.340
 - No, woodpecker fork.

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:55.060
 - Mrs. Jones is coming round

00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:56.620
 and get the woodpecker tongs.

00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:58.460
 Oh, no, we, oh, what a faux pas.

00:29:58.460 --> 00:29:59.900
 (laughing)

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:02.620
 - Just annoying, unannoying car noises.

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:04.580
 The car horn, quite annoying now,

00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:07.500
 used to be so much worse.

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:10.100
 So the word klaxon in fact comes from,

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:11.540
 was invented for cars.

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:12.500
 - Jeremy klaxon, yes.

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:13.340
 (laughing)

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:14.180
 - Yes.

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:15.020
 - He invented it.

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:18.380
 - Oh, why hasn't he changed his name?

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:19.740
 He should.

00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:23.020
 So this was sort of pre-war, pre-Second World War.

00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:24.900
 Cars had horns that were like klaxons.

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:27.340
 So, you know, the klaxon noise is like a woo.

00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:28.180
 - A woo-ga.

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:29.020
 - A woo-ga.

00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:29.840
 - Yeah.

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:30.680
 - Yeah, it was that.

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:32.260
 But you, was I saying to you guys last week

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:33.580
 that my grandma always honked the horn

00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:35.900
 when she turned, when she took corners?

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:36.940
 Well, that used to be the rule.

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:38.140
 You'd be fined if you didn't,

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:39.660
 because there was no other way of knowing

00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:41.540
 when car engines weren't as big.

00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:43.420
 And so they were constantly,

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:44.700
 whenever anyone turned a corner,

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:46.460
 when everyone was coming up to a junction,

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:47.820
 whenever you were about to park,

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:49.980
 you beeped your, woo-ga.

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:50.820
 - That is annoying.

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:51.660
 - And people hated it.

00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:52.580
 - It's kind of like the legacy

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:54.140
 of the man with the red flag.

00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:54.980
 - Yes.

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:55.820
 - A little bit.

00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:56.780
 - But less annoying, the man with the red flag.

00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:58.140
 I don't think I'd mind that as much.

00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:02.060
 It's a bit like, beep, beep, vehicle reversing.

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:05.540
 - So, do you know who the godfather of backing up is?

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:07.060
 - Like the godfather of soul.

00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:08.900
 - Yeah, just like that.

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:12.700
 - Do you mean the sound or literally backing up a car?

00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:14.380
 - The sound that's made when you back up a car,

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:16.300
 the beeping, when you're reversing.

00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:17.980
 - So, who's the godfather of creating that sound?

00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:18.820
 I don't get what you're asking.

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:20.060
 - It's a man called Ed Peterson.

00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:20.900
 - Okay.

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:23.100
 - Oh, I was just about to say him.

00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:24.500
 - So, he was the pioneer in the West,

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:25.740
 and he may have been beaten to it

00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:29.620
 by Matthew Saburo Yamaguchi in 1953.

00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:32.340
 But Peterson noticed, he was working at a dam,

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:34.340
 a construction project, huge construction project.

00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:36.700
 And he noticed, gosh, people keep being killed or injured

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:39.700
 when really heavy vehicles reverse into them.

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:42.460
 If only there was some, and he said the flag men

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:43.700
 were just not doing their jobs.

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:45.580
 And that was the system.

00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:47.740
 Weirdly, the, you know, like waving flags around

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:48.820
 saying, look out, someone's reversing.

00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:49.980
 That system wasn't working.

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:52.860
 - I can't believe if you're holding a flag to wave

00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:53.780
 and a person about to get run over,

00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:54.900
 why aren't you also going,

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:56.220
 there's a car, it's about to run you over,

00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:58.060
 there's a car, quick, get out of the way.

00:31:58.060 --> 00:31:59.020
 - I don't know.

00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:00.500
 Maybe they're standing at a distance.

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:01.460
 - Probably a union thing.

00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:03.340
 - Yeah, a union thing.

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:05.460
 - We won't pay them extra for that.

00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:07.060
 - Anyway, just wanted to give him his credit.

00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:08.820
 Ed Peterson, all right.

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:12.260
 - Do you know who has the best car horns?

00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:13.100
 - Ooh.

00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:15.300
 - What country?

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:17.180
 - Oh, is there a country where it's, you know,

00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:19.940
 it leaps south like in "Jukes of Huzzard"?

00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:22.220
 ♪ Ha da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da ♪

00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:26.300
 - Ah, so you're interpreting it differently to how I mean.

00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:27.140
 - The best.

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:30.660
 - So, by best, it's long lasting, louder.

00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:32.500
 This is in India.

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:35.260
 - Yeah, it is in India, and the reason is that

00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:37.260
 because the culture of driving there

00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:40.700
 has a much more emphasis on the beeping when you're in,

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:43.100
 and so they need cars, they actually make,

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:46.540
 like Audi make stronger, better horns

00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:48.700
 so that they don't run them down

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:50.380
 with the amount that they're using them.

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:52.820
 - That is, they do use it properly in India.

00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:55.300
 They use it to tell you, "I'm about to drive into you."

00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:57.140
 - You're in danger, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:59.580
 - Well, that implies that incredibly bad drivers,

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:00.900
 if they're always using it properly,

00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:02.820
 but they're always using it.

00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:04.780
 - I think it's so busy traffic-wise.

00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:05.620
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:08.780
 - And the way to cross the road is just to get cracking.

00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:12.380
 - It's like British Kettles, they're long lasting.

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:13.980
 This is personal anecdote, but--

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:14.820
 - British Kettles.

00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:15.860
 - British Kettles. - Best in the world.

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:17.860
 - Yeah, I was just confused by the analogy.

00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:18.820
 - Well, I'm just remembering

00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:21.020
 because Dan's wife has bought like 20 Kettles.

00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:23.020
 - Yeah, she keeps buying European ones

00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:25.420
 because they look nice and they keep dying

00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:27.860
 'cause they can't keep up with the British tea consuming.

00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:28.700
 - Out of the kilowatts.

00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:29.540
 - Yeah. - It's an anecdote,

00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:30.380
 it's just gone flooding back.

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:33.100
 (all laughing)

00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:36.620
 - Did you come across the car that Cadillac invented

00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:38.740
 which had a working toilet in it?

00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:39.580
 - Oh.

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:40.820
 - Sorry, not Cadillac invented.

00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:44.060
 One random bloke modified so that he could,

00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:45.300
 this was a guy called Louis Matta

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:49.540
 and he wanted to drive 10,000 kilometers without stopping.

00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:51.020
 LA to New York and back.

00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:53.460
 - Right, so he must have put the toilet on the driving seat.

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:54.300
 - He put the toilet,

00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:55.620
 well, there were a couple of them in the car.

00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:57.540
 - How long does it take to drive that distance?

00:33:57.540 --> 00:33:59.540
 - It must be like 10 days.

00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:02.060
 - That would be 1,000 kilometers a day,

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:04.300
 maybe a bit longer than that, I think that's quite a bit.

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:05.140
 - Yeah.

00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:09.300
 - He will have to stop at some stage to sleep, right?

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:11.140
 - Well, no, but there were a couple of them in the car.

00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:13.300
 So they would shift into the driving seat.

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:17.220
 This was in 1952, for God knows why he wanted to do this.

00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:20.340
 But he'd been in the Navy, he was an engineer

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:22.180
 and it had a toilet, it had a shower,

00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:25.300
 it had a TV, a fridge and a sink

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:27.140
 and they were escorted when they were in a town

00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:28.220
 by the local police who would help them

00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:29.340
 through the traffic lights.

00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:31.580
 So they could literally keep moving for this time.

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:33.540
 - It's just like a caravan really.

00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:36.220
 - It's just like a caravan, except I love this.

00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:38.940
 What's another flaw in this plan?

00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:41.660
 - We have to let out what you're carrying.

00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:43.180
 - Now I assume he's got a shed load of petrol

00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:44.900
 that's filling up the car.

00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:48.820
 - He can refuel on the go, that's cool.

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:52.820
 And what if the worst happens, you burst a tire,

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:54.420
 they had a system to change a tire

00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:56.060
 while the car was driving.

00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:59.740
 - Wow, it's so cool, as Jack would lift up one tire

00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:01.620
 and this tiny little supermarket trolley wheel

00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:03.380
 would take that corner of the car

00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:05.460
 and then his friends would like lean over the side

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:07.540
 and change the tire and then change it back

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:08.460
 and then you just pop it back up.

00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:10.860
 - You would be impossible to steer

00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:13.180
 if it's got a supermarket trolley wheel on it.

00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:15.300
 (all laughing)

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:18.140
 - The laziest all of this bit of observational comedy

00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:19.540
 that's ever been made.

00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:22.120
 (upbeat music)

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:25.540
 - Okay, that's it.

00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:26.860
 That is all of our outtakes.

00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:27.940
 We hope you enjoyed that.

00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:29.460
 You got any comments, you got any questions,

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:30.540
 you got any extra facts,

00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:33.020
 why not send them to podcast@qi.com?

00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:35.020
 And if they are seen by Andy,

00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:37.220
 they might make their way onto an upcoming

00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:38.460
 Drop Us a Line episode.
