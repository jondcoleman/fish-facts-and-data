00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing There's a Fish

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.520
 where we were joined by one of my favourite guests we've ever had.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.520
 I mean, I love them all.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.360
 Mmm.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.120
 And even though this one's from Yorkshire, I thought she was brilliant.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:13.920
 Fighting talk.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.440
 Uh, yes, it's the brilliant Amy Gledhill.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.600
 Um, you don't want to miss this episode.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.200
 You're already listening to it, so don't worry.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.480
 But it was so much fun to record.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.000
 Amy is absolutely terrific.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.080
 It's just really, really fun.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.760
 We hope you like it.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.320
 The main thing she wanted to let us know about

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.440
 was two podcasts that she made. One is called Single Ladies in Your Area,

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.240
 which is her and Harriet Kenzley, and the other is Northern News,

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.200
 which actually, James and I have both been on.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.800
 It's her and Ian Smith.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.080
 And it's so funny.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.840
 It's so funny.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.240
 It's just a brilliant show.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.360
 It's so good.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.760
 She didn't really say that we should mention this,

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.880
 but we should say also, next year,

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.240
 she's going to be on the last one laughing,

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.120
 is it cold, which everyone loves this year.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.280
 The second season is coming out,

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.960
 she's going to be one of the stars of that.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.200
 So she's absolutely brilliant comedian.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.480
 You're going to love this show.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.320
 You're going to love the 50-minute version,

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.720
 which is right here.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.240
 But if you'd like to hear even more Amy,

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.560
 then there is a chance to do that.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.920
 And that is by joining our Patreon @ThePlentyMoreFishTier,

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.160
 because in that place, not only will you get longer episodes of fish,

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.360
 you will also get videos of our super duper mailbox show, Drop us a Line.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.880
 That's right.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.560

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.520

 We've been having an absolute blast making lots of new stuff for that.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.440
 Go there and check it out. It's so much fun.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.160
 But in the meantime, enjoy this show,

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.960
 and honestly, there is a moment in this show

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.000
 where I've known Dan for 20 years,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.600
 and he told me an anecdote about his life that I cannot believe.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.080
 You'll know it when you hear it.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.240
 Oh, in the podcast.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.160
 On with the show.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.560
 [BELL RINGING]

00:01:52.560 --> 00:02:06.560
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing As A Fish,"

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.160
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Hobern.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.400
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.400
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin,

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.680
 and Amy Gladhill.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.600
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.520
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.720
 and in a particular order, here we go.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.560
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Amy.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.040
 Ah, okay.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.040
 In North Carolina, it's illegal to play Bingo for six hours straight.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.640
 [LAUGHTER]

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.680
 I'm sorry if that's sad news for any of you.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.000
 Did you learn this the hard way?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.440
 I just found out, present this morning.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.720
 It was real.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.680
 Once you're into Bingo, you can't just stop.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.040
 If you're mid-game and it hits the six-hour point,

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.280
 you meant to just duck out.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.360
 Yeah, yeah.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.560
 I learned there's a game of Bingo.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.360
 It's a long time since I played Bingo.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.960
 Is it?

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.920
 I played at university a few times.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.400
 Is it-- it can't be-- it's multiple games, surely, right?

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.520
 It can't just be one game.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.480
 What depends on the delivery?

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.680
 You know, like the caller can go as slow as he or she likes.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.920
 Yeah, right, you know.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.320
 I found that there is actually a Bingo caller

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.720
 of the year competition.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:11.520
 Oh.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.600
 Yeah.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.680
 And each region--

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.480
 I think it's been six regions.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.240
 Each region, you get 10 finalists,

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.640
 and then they literally compete like in a live event.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.480
 In it, it says, to be a winner.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.720
 You need to be a bit of a showman or woman, a performer.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.840
 You need to enjoy the attention and want to make people smile.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.560
 But you also need to know when to be authoritative, as well.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.000
 An extra talent, such as singing or comedy,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.960
 doesn't hurt either.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.480
 Who's doing a song?

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.320
 Be the Bingo!

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.800
 If you were down to one number, and your heart's racing,

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.600
 and then someone's like, make a comeback,

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.920
 and laugh, make a laugh.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:47.880
 Come on!

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.040
 Do we know if the callers in the call of the year

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.560
 are they allowed to come up with different calls?

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.960
 Like, legs 11, they can do something else.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.280
 So interesting.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.680
 Because I found in other countries,

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.040
 sometimes they have different calls when they do Bingo.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.280
 Right.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.440
 I found that in Russia, they have drumsticks

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.240
 instead of legs 11.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.720
 And for 40, they say, "Ali Baba," because he had 40 thieves.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.880
 And when they say, "43," now, when I was younger,

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.200
 the Bingo collar would say, "Down on your knees, 43."

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.080
 I'm not really sure what that meant.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.160
 But in Russia, apparently, they say, "Stalingrad, 43."

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.080
 Oh!

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.240
 "Jews, the World War II battle were two million people were killed."

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.480
 So there's a bit grim, isn't it?

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.320
 Wow.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.160
 Yeah.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.480
 I love the calls.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.720
 Because I've never played Bingo.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.240
 So--

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.080
 Have you?

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.760
 No, what?

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.280
 I've never met my life like Bingo.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.720
 Have I got a nice help for you?

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.400
 Oh, now that I know all the calls, I'd love it.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.480
 Number-- what's--

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.480
 Number six, Tom Mix.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.560
 Do you know who Tom Mix is?

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.080
 No.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.360
 How is Tom Mix made it into Bingo calling?

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.360
 He was never in it where I used to do--

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.560
 I've never heard of Tom Mix.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.440
 Tom Mix, he's massive.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.960
 He was like American cowboy actor.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.240
 He inspired John Wayne and all these other people.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.640
 He's on the cover of "Sorgeon Peppers Lonely Heartbreak."

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.240
 Yeah, he's one of the cutouts.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.000
 Tom Mix.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.920
 You could have, like, Stevie Nicks.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:09.640
 Stevie Nicks.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.400
 Little mix.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.160
 Little mix.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.080
 I'll tell Dix, I was going to say.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.920
 Who's I'll tell Dix?

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.400
 I'll tell Dix.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.280
 Good question.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.120
 [LAUGHTER]

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.440
 Well, yeah, a lot of the-- you find, when you look at the calls,

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.520
 a lot of them date back to the 1920s and '30s.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.440
 Yeah, it's not a game that has moved at the time.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.960
 Yeah.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.520
 There are occasional attempts to update

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.880
 what they call Bingo Lingo.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.760
 Oh, yeah.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.880
 There was a report five years ago and it's completely

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.360
 jumped up by a Bingo company.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.560
 Like, that woke millennials were abandoning

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.000
 the traditional calls, and they were being updated instead.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.720
 So 38.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.480
 Avocado on a plate.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.480
 No.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.920
 No, no, no, no.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:49.960
 49.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.480
 Time to buy a house.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.480
 Oh, no, it doesn't work.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.520
 She's unwind.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.440
 I'll call free wine.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.200
 I was going to say Amazon Prime.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.160
 [LAUGHTER]

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.280
 Seven.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.560
 And don't pay any attention to the rhyme here.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.640
 It won't help you.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:05.640
 [LAUGHTER]

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.640
 The number of David Beckham when he played for Man United.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:09.160
 That's it?

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.760
 Oh, it's a Beckham name.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:11.840
 David Beckham, number seven.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.040
 Yeah, that is good.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.000
 It works, it's not bad, yeah.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.160
 It's better than the rhyme they came up with.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.160
 OK.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.240
 Seven Flexitarian.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.200
 Flexitarian.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.200
 What's that?

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.280
 Someone who is vegetarian, but has a bit of meat sometimes.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.440
 Yeah.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.440
 Yeah, OK.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.360
 Can I say number seven?

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.320
 [LAUGHTER]

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.920
 I'm just going back to North Carolina about why it's illegal

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.160
 to play Six Hours Straight.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.400
 Basically, all gambling was illegal in North Carolina.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.240
 But then there was this thing about charities

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.600
 wanting to do bingo.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.680
 So they had to make it legal so the charities could do it.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.600
 But they didn't want to encourage people to open bingo holes

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.400
 where people get them all the time.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.720
 So they put in these really tight restrictions.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.080
 So as well as only being able to play for five hours

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.000
 at a time, you're not allowed to games of bingo

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 within a 48-hour period of each other

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.560
 to be held in the same building, right?

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.480
 And also, no alcohol out, which kind of defeats the point,

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.440
 I think, really.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.760
 So I didn't think it was a boozy thing.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:12.080
 I think of it as being the tea time.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.080
 No.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.120
 Well, these days, they have bingo nights out

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.040
 that you can go on, which are really boozy.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.640
 And so do you play bingo?

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:20.480
 Oh, yeah.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.480
 Do you?

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.600
 Oh, yeah.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.000
 I was so cynical about it until about five years ago.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.480
 I was like, who's going to bingo wash?

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.280
 Stupid night out?

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.960
 Who cares if you've got a number on a thing

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.800
 and you dabbing, you dabbing on it?

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.760
 And then I went, and it was the most exhilarating thing

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:35.680
 I've ever done.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.480
 Really?

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:40.720
 Well, it's absolutely incredible, like I'm getting goosebumps

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.800
 thinking about bingo.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.480
 It's because it's hard.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.080
 It's like, it's hard to do, which I didn't expect.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:48.680
 Is it?

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.560
 Look, I know you're all very intelligent.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.560
 Bingo is hard.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.800
 And bingo's all the numbers.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:53.640
 I know.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.040
 I know the first hundred.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.840
 I do know the first hundred.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.680
 And you only need to 90, so you're going to be fine.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:00.280
 Oh, really?

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.320
 And it goes up to 90, yeah.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:05.920
 But it's fast, and it's quick, and they take no prisoners.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.400
 And if you go, oh, so what was, they've moved on.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.400
 Really?

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.400
 Much like it's Starlengrad.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.200
 No prisoners taken there.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.480
 What is it like?

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.280
 So the kind you were playing that was so exciting.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.040
 Yeah.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.280
 Was it?

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.200
 I don't-- I'm not trying to--

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.160
 I'm not trying to be mean or anything.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.280
 What's it?

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.400
 Classic bingo, which I would think of as, like,

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.680
 blue rinse bingo.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.200
 Yeah.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.360
 I'm saying, like, like, fill it all.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.360
 Yeah.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.320
 And you might have been one of the younger clientele.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.360
 I love the way that you're trying to do that.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.520
 What's it in the North, Alie?

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:37.520
 What's it in the North?

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.600
 Was it elderly ladies in the North?

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.400
 It was elderly ladies in the North.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.080
 We all had chips and gravy.

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:47.240
 There was lots of cups of tea, rattling on the table.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:50.480
 And then it was silence, like I have never heard before,

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.600
 when they go, eyes down for a full house.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.680
 And everyone pin drops it.

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.120
 You can hate people's heartbeats.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.800
 It's so exciting.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:58.800
 It's so exciting.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:08:59.800
 It's so exciting.

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:00.320
 Yeah, yeah.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.400
 How can we get disabled seats to eat?

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.400
 What was that?

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:07.240
 No way, oh god, you missed the goal.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.120
 My way.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.120
 Oh, no!

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:14.960
 I could see how, like, you could just be in it

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.120
 and come out and six hours have gone.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.280
 It's only you and 17 granny's are being incarcerated.

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.480
 [LAUGHTER]

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:23.080
 Yeah.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.800
 Because I know there are nights now that are things like--

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:29.080
 well, friend of mine was the first ever host of rebel bingo.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.120
 And there's bonkers bingo.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.480
 There's bongos bingo.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.840
 And they're sort of big, they're like club nights.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:35.640
 They're club nights.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:36.440
 Combined with bingo.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.400
 Full club nights, then.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:37.920
 Yeah.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.440
 But they don't sound awful on them.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:44.640
 No, I actually think your bluerin's bingo is--

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.680
 like, it's a genuinely exhilarating night out.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.000
 We should go on a group outing.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.080
 I don't think we'd be accepted.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:56.040
 Because we would make noise, and they would have like it.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.520
 We just want to chat to each other.

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:57.920
 Yeah.

00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:58.760
 We do when we're out.

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:00.520
 And if you make the single sound--

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:01.320
 you'll be leaving over.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.160
 Interesting thing about the number 37.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:03.480
 Yes.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:06.480
 I can tell you, as a last graduate, you are.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.680
 Tom Mix was actually on the front of Sarge in front of us.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.720
 [LAUGHTER]

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:15.320
 So like, the modern bingo renaissance, let's say,

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.560
 I think came from mecha bingo, right?

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:20.320
 So anyone in the towns of the UK

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.360
 will probably have had a mecha bingo, or probably still do.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.760
 And this was invented by Eric Morley.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:29.360
 He also invented strictly condensing.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:29.880
 Oh, wow.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:30.920
 Same guy.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.840
 Because he ran the load of dance halls.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.880
 And so he wanted to get dance halls to be big.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.560
 So he did strictly.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.920
 And also, when dance halls became less popular,

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.760
 he brought bingo in there.

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:44.200
 And in 1951, he hosted, and was in charge

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:47.840
 of the first Miss World contest, as well, Eric Morley.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:48.720
 Legs 11.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:49.720
 Yes.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:50.800
 [LAUGHTER]

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:51.560
 No fat lady.

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:52.440
 It was--

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:55.320
 [LAUGHTER]

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.880
 The winner was Kiki Hackinson from Sweden.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.160
 She was crowned wearing her bikini.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.640
 And the whole event was condemned by friend of the podcast,

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:07.720
 Pope Pius XII, who said that the whole thing was completely

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.320
 sinful and it's really allowed.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.520
 And then it basically said the bikini itself was sinful.

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:13.280
 Wow.

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:13.920
 You know?

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.240
 Yeah.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.560
 Was he wrong with outside?

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:18.960
 But comes to condensing.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.800
 The TV show is strictly condensing dancing with the stars.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:25.320
 His family are basically still earning off the back of that.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.120
 Morley's family.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.520
 Morley's family.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:32.400
 And rather excitingly, he was born in Hobern.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:37.320
 We are within minutes walk of the birth place.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:38.680
 Is there a blue plaque?

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:39.200
 I don't know.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:39.800
 There better be.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.320
 I doubt it.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.720
 Macabingo got in a bit of trouble, actually.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.520
 Around 1997.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:46.960
 Can you guess why?

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.080
 In 1997.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.320
 That won't help you.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:55.680
 Is it something to do with Muslim people praying?

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:56.520
 It is.

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:57.360
 Is it really?

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:03.520
 It's basically, there were some protests by Muslims saying,

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.000
 we don't really think this name is on.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:05.920
 Oh, yeah, thank you.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:08.840
 Our religion doesn't really go in for gambling.

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.280
 Actually, no, I think about it.

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:11.760
 I think they have a good pipe there.

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:13.320
 Yeah, it was in Luton.

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:16.560
 And I think maybe they'd opened up in Luton, Macabingo, I mean.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.680
 And so I think there's quite big Muslim population there.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.040
 And so there were lots of prizes.

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.160
 There were bricks through the windows.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.440
 I'm afraid it all got a bit, it all got a bit tense for a while.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.440
 But it is the holiest city in Islam.

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:29.200
 Yes, but it's also the catchphrase.

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.800
 And what it just meant was like, this is a mecca for shopping.

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.040
 Or this is only ideal, this is a mecca for dancing.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:37.080
 It just means this is somewhere you go when you want to dance.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.640
 But obviously, where does that word come from?

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.240
 I suspect it comes from the fact it's the holiest city in Islam.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.640
 So it led to say, and they said, right, we'll change our name.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:45.800
 And then they didn't.

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:46.800
 Right.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:47.800
 Really?

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.320
 And 30 years later, it's fine.

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.080
 And it's still going.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:50.920
 Wow.

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:54.280
 Eric Morley, he was part of the British sort of raising of Bingo.

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:58.720
 But in America, there was an entirely different person called Edwin S. Low,

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.160
 who made it massive there.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.880
 And he saw it as a game that was being played in carnivals.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:04.840
 And he thought, this is an amazing idea.

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:07.320
 And it wasn't originally called Bingo in America.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:10.360
 In fact, it had an even more British name that you could imagine.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.920
 It was called Bino.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:12.920
 Bino.

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:14.280
 Bino was the original name of Bingo.

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:16.440
 You know, it was like an American word for a party, isn't it?

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.200
 Yes.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.040
 That's right.

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.880
 But you know, yeah, like a bean feast, I guess.

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:21.680
 Yeah.

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:22.360
 Wow.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.560
 Good old bean feast.

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:25.800
 You don't get enough of a feast there.

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:30.400
 Can I tell you a couple of quick calls that are specifically military?

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:31.360
 Oh, OK.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:37.120
 Because a lot of it dates back to the early 20th century or even the late 19th century.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:44.320
 And the army had allowed Bingo, partly because they wanted to allow not total gambling,

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.000
 but a kind of form.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.640
 It was a really popular game.

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:47.600
 And it is gambling.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.440
 And really, everyone puts a bit of money in and the winner gets it all.

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:52.000
 So it's not like a mess.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.720
 It's not quite, it's not like, I don't know, slot machines or whatever.

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:55.720
 Yeah.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:56.720
 So does the House ever win?

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:57.960
 Does the game end when no one's playing?

00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:58.960
 No.

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.480
 House never wins.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.720
 But loads of the rhyming calls traditionally date back to the 19th century military.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:06.800
 He said, cause it had been allowed in the army in the first place.

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.440
 So 51?

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.440
 Well, it's my gun.

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:11.120
 Oh, very nice.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.160
 The Highland Division.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:13.920
 Of course.

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.160
 So catchy, isn't it?

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.320
 And there's also, was she worth it?

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:19.480
 Seven and six?

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:20.960
 I don't know why that is seven and six.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.200
 It was the price of a lady of the night, or?

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.440
 It was the price of a marriage, certificate.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:32.320
 Oh, yeah, yeah, I mean, similar, similar vengeance, but it's like that.

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:35.760
 That says a lot about my relationship, isn't it?

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.240
 Ah, a sex worker, a wife.

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:39.480
 Oh, that's it, yeah, yeah.

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:43.560
 Well, the country, though, if they were to say price, if you were sent off again.

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:46.640
 Why did they put the marriage certificate off his neck to the brothel?

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:50.800
 Oh, how did you know that, Amy?

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:52.080
 Just straight out there.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.080
 That was the price.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.880
 Seven and six was the price of a marriage.

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:58.400
 Sometimes bingo knowledge is just in my bones.

00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.400
 Yeah.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.640
 I'm really impressed.

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:04.280
 All right, well, last one, Pompi Hort, 24.

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:05.280
 Oh, dear.

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:06.280
 Oh, that's...

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:07.280
 That's Portsmouth.

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:08.280
 Portsmouth sailors on leave.

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:09.280
 Oh, no.

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:11.280
 Sorry, that's where I met my wife.

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:12.280
 Yeah.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.280
 Wife.

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:14.280
 Yeah.

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:23.720
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:28.240
 My point is that in 2010, it was reported that pizza or express was training its staff

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:32.400
 how to flirt subtly with customers so they felt more relaxed.

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.400
 Is it more relaxing?

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.160
 I wouldn't, it depends on the flirting, doesn't it?

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.160
 Yeah.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.400
 But it's just someone being friendly and attentive, but is that flirting?

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:40.400
 No, really?

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.400
 No, really, no.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:45.280
 This was reported, basically, as just a thing that pizza or express for trying.

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:49.600
 I think it was in their Richmond branch, and they'd hired an actor to train the staff

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:54.440
 to just, you know, be a bit extra friendly, I suppose.

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:57.800
 He said there's a difference between flirting with someone and coming onto them.

00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.240
 We're not asking them to do that.

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:00.240
 That would be mad.

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.240
 Yeah.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:05.000
 It would slow down service among other things, you know?

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.760
 But if you're a guy in a really gorgeous Italian girl comes to your table, it's great to

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:09.760
 meet somebody like that.

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:10.800
 And says, "Doble, sir?"

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:15.000
 No, it's just the way I'm sat.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 Yeah, and it's even better to hear her talk with passion and authenticity about the

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.360
 ingredients on the menu.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:23.840
 That's the flotation we're talking about.

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:26.120
 Again, I just think that falls under normal weight-resign.

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:30.240
 Also, I don't know if Mr James knew how many of the pizza or express staff are actually

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:34.240
 Italian, because it's certainly around my local, it's not required.

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.240
 No.

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:37.280
 Maybe, maybe people like flirting with you.

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:38.680
 Maybe that's just a natural thing, Andy.

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:39.680
 Oh, they're not flirting.

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:40.680
 No, no, no, no.

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:41.680
 Absolutely not.

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:45.440
 I don't know, so they didn't take it beyond this first and only pizza express.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:48.800
 They reported that they were considering rolling it out, and there the trail goes cold.

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:49.800
 Right.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:50.800
 Yeah.

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:55.120
 It would be very tricky for the staff to hear one day, like, "Oh, the job roll has changed

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.120
 ever so slightly.

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:58.360
 You're still serving the pizza, he's still taking the orders.

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:02.720
 You do need to sort of, really sexually excite the customers now."

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:03.720
 Excuse me?

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:04.720
 Yeah.

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:08.760
 It's like, you do the doubles, you know, you make sure they've had the starters, and then

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:12.840
 you just sort of look at the lips a lot, and you're like, "No, obviously you're not going

00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:13.840
 to need the orders."

00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:17.840
 If someone lots of my lips, when I was in pizza express, I would assume I had a knowledge

00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:18.840
 on that.

00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:19.840
 Yeah.

00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:20.840
 Yeah.

00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:25.840
 Flirting is actively not encouraged in quite a lot of industries.

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:26.920
 They actively say, "Don't flirt."

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:29.720
 I saw a headline talking about New York taxi drivers.

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:31.000
 This was genuinely the headline.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.840
 I think it was in the independent.

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:38.480
 New York taxi drivers to be banned from flirting with, or ejaculating on passengers.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:42.720
 I think flirting can go too far at times.

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:46.560
 I mean, he's facing the wrong way.

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:47.560
 Or she?

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:48.560
 But...

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:54.560
 You'll never guess who I ejaculate, you know, last week.

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:58.920
 Damn, what is this headline?

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:04.600
 It was just New York officials that said that they'd need to ban, because flirting would

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:08.280
 be happening, and people were complaining, and they had people writing in saying, "I'm

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:12.760
 sorry, I feel uncomfortable in the back of the cab when I'm being flirted with," and all

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:13.760
 ejaculated on.

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:14.760
 No, stop it, Jack.

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:15.760
 Wow.

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:21.960
 But for it to be banned, it must be happening at a frequency that's enough for it to need

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:22.960
 banning.

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:27.840
 I actually think they're already lashing it to ejaculate, sorry, Sam, that's banning already.

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:34.840
 That's the sauna in Leeds, where there's a sign in the sauna that says, "Do not piss."

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:35.840
 And it says, "Piss."

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:36.840
 It doesn't say, "You're in there."

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:41.160
 There's "Do not piss on the coals," and you're like, "Well, how often is it happening?"

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:44.040
 But they needed a sign.

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:47.080
 You'd be mad to put up, and no one has ever pissed on the coals.

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:48.080
 Absolutely.

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:51.040
 Because, in a way, I'd be like, "Well, I never thought of that."

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:53.240
 A lot of it steams more than what.

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:57.960
 So question, is it worse to piss on the coals, and put, "As in, is that going into your

00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:58.960
 pores?"

00:18:58.960 --> 00:18:59.960
 You know?

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:00.960
 I don't know.

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:01.960
 No, it'll be fine.

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:02.960
 It'll be fine.

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:03.960
 It'll be fine.

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:04.960
 Because it's water, it'll be fine.

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:06.960
 Are you the person that piss?

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:07.960
 I'm not defending it.

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:08.960
 I'm just saying.

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:10.960
 It also contains urea.

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:11.960
 Right.

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.960
 And that's not going to mean that there's going to be an ammonia in the air when you...

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:15.960
 There'll be an ammonia in the air, definitely.

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.960
 No one's denying that.

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:19.960
 Just saying is...

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.960
 There will be a tang in the air.

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:25.560
 Just don't know if breathing in vaporised pisses.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:26.560
 I know it's not nice.

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:29.560
 I know it's not nice, but I just don't know if it's...

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:30.560
 It depends how much, doesn't it?

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:31.560
 Quantity is all.

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:32.560
 That's the problem.

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:33.560
 You're on there.

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:34.560
 It's like, "I just don't know if it's any worse, you're on there."

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:35.560
 I would just...

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:38.560
 Based on the calls, I don't think it affects anything.

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:39.560
 Did you see this firstly?

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:40.560
 Yeah, just this firstly.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:44.560
 And then I was like, "Pull your pants back up, okay?"

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:45.560
 Whoops.

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:46.560
 Oh no.

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:47.560
 Oh no.

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:48.560
 Oh no.

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:49.560
 Oh no.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:50.560
 Oh no.

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:51.560
 God.

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:52.560
 Yeah.

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:53.560
 Don't piss on my pants.

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:54.560
 It sounds like a saying.

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:56.560
 Like I wouldn't piss on his coal.

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:57.560
 You know?

00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:59.560
 Yes.

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:00.560
 So flirting.

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:01.560
 Yeah.

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:03.560
 I mean, you make a show about...

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:04.560
 I love dating romance.

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:05.560
 Yes.

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:06.560
 Yeah.

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:07.560
 Call no than news, no.

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:08.560
 Call single ladies in your area.

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:09.560
 Single ladies.

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:10.560
 Okay.

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:12.560
 I just wanted to ask, if you have encountered this...

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:13.560
 Okay.

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:14.560
 Because you have been on dating absence.

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:15.560
 Oh, yeah.

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:16.560
 Big time.

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:22.560
 Have you encountered people flirting with you who you suspect of using artificial intelligence?

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:23.560
 Hmm.

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:25.560
 I've never considered that.

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:29.880
 Because this is the thing that's been coming up in the news more and more this year.

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:34.880
 People are basically coming up with responses to questions by putting it into chat GPT or whatever.

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:35.880
 And then saying...

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:36.880
 No, no, no, no.

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:41.880
 And then people are going on dates with them and finding you're not interesting or funny at all.

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:42.880
 Wow.

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.880
 Because everything they've done has basically been mediated through.

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:47.880
 And sometimes you'll get two people using chat GPT talking to each other.

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:51.880
 And there's basically two robots talking to each other using the medium of humans.

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:52.880
 Wow.

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:53.880
 It's...

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:54.880
 I know.

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:55.880
 But you haven't found that.

00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:01.880
 And I don't... I don't think so. And if they are using chat GPT and that's been punched up,

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:04.880
 I would hate to see what they started with.

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:10.880
 Because if they need chat GPT to get to what you've been up to this weekend question mark kiss,

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:14.880
 then what AI is not taking over.

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:17.880
 The person who...

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:24.880
 One of founders of Bumble who's Whitney Wolf heard reckons that soon we'll be able to have sort of AI versions of ourselves

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:31.880
 that have basically all of my lines or things that I would be likely to say will be in this AI version.

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:36.880
 And then you might have your AI version and our two AI's can meet and see if they get on.

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:40.880
 And if our little robot speed can get on, then we will get on in real life.

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.880
 Yeah, I mean, it kind of makes sense.

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:43.880
 It makes sense.

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:44.880
 Yeah.

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:45.880
 Is that a world you want to live in?

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:46.880
 It's true.

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:47.880
 It's odd.

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:48.880
 I'm out of that world now.

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:49.880
 Have there a opinion on it, really?

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:56.880
 I suppose the experience of being on the apps is so boring and annoying and lots of people chat to you for a bit,

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:58.880
 then they just disappear without anything.

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:02.880
 I can imagine any shortcut to not doing that anymore would be a good thing.

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:03.880
 Yeah.

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:04.880
 Well, I tried it.

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:10.880
 I tried chat GPT-generated flirting on my wife.

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:11.880
 Oh, okay.

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:15.880
 But I just asked chat GPT, can you come up with something flirtatious for me to say to my wife?

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:20.880
 Yeah, line one, your laugh is my favourite song and your arms are my favourite place to be.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:21.880
 Oh, yeah.

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:22.880
 She said, okay.

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:30.880
 And then I thought, this is going well.

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.880
 I'll follow it up.

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:33.880
 You still give me butterflies.

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:37.880
 I must have done something amazing to deserve you as you said, what's going on?

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:39.880
 It's just like what?

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:40.880
 Very much.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:42.880
 Have you crashed the car?

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:43.880
 Yeah.

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:46.880
 And then I said, I would love to answer this, but you have no more free chats left.

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.880
 Please upgrade the pro to continue.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:50.880
 That sealed the deal.

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:51.880
 She said, you got me.

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:52.880
 Yeah.

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:54.880
 Upstairs now.

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:59.880
 Wow, we, that's amazing.

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:00.880
 No, Grim.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:06.880
 Can I tell you some historical flirting techniques from Lanccia where I'm from?

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:07.880
 Oh, okay.

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:12.880
 There was a thing called promenading or promenading where a load of boys and girls

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.880
 stand on opposite sides of a road to each other.

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:15.880
 And they wouldn't say anything.

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:20.880
 They'd just try and make eye contact with each other and sort of like smile and stuff like that.

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:23.880
 And then everyone would go home.

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:27.880
 And if the girl fancyed the boy, she would leave a cake outside his house.

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:29.880
 And then that would mean they were dating.

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:30.880
 So you would know.

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:31.880
 Wow.

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:32.880
 Feels like I could create confusion.

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:36.880
 What if you were able to eye contact with two people and you have found one cake outside your house?

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:37.880
 Yeah.

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:39.880
 Maybe the cake has the name on it.

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:40.880
 That's a good idea.

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:43.880
 Or is it still my day, Dan?

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:44.880
 Still my day.

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:45.880
 Still my day.

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:47.880
 Got the seven and six ready.

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:52.880
 And this is early 20th century.

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:54.880
 So a little bit before my day.

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.880
 Just on the cast.

00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:00.880
 And then there's a guy called Spanking Roger, who's one of my favourite people in history.

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:01.880
 Oh, yeah.

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:08.880
 And he got together with his partner through a thing that used to happen on the malls just outside Manchester.

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:13.880
 And they would have a naked race of all the young lads in the town.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:18.880
 And then the girls would sort of stand there watching and sort of eye up the form of everyone there.

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:22.880
 And then a bit later they'd all go down the pub and they'd go, yeah, like the look at you.

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:23.880
 Oh, my god.

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:25.880
 He was called Spanking's Banking Roger.

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:27.880
 Yeah, because he was also a boxer.

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:28.880
 No, no.

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:29.880
 I was like, something.

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:32.880
 Something heard the question.

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:36.880
 No, he would beat people up, like beat people in the ring.

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.880
 And he'd give you a shot.

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.880
 He'd give you a, he'd give you a spanking.

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:41.880
 Yeah, right, right.

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:42.880
 Wow.

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:43.880
 Like a live naked attraction.

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:44.880
 Yeah.

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:46.880
 But moving, like moving, yeah.

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:47.880
 Those are naked attractions.

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:49.880
 You don't know how well they can move.

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:50.880
 They're just standing there, aren't they?

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:52.880
 It's a good point actually.

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:53.880
 That's a really good point.

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:56.880
 Tell me, Amy, why do humans fly?

00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:57.880
 Why do humans fly?

00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:02.880
 Like, why do we not just come up to each other and say, I want to have sex with you and then have children that way?

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:03.880
 Oh, I don't know.

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:06.880
 It's much easier if we're allowed to do that with Nick.

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:07.880
 God.

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:09.880
 I honestly think that would be fantastic.

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:12.880
 If, but you could all just be honest and be like, you're physically attractive.

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:15.880
 And I think we should put our meat sacks together.

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:17.880
 Like, I think that would just be so much easier.

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:18.880
 But I don't know.

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:20.880
 So there's a New York taxi driver listening to this right now.

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:21.880
 On breach.

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:30.880
 I guess there must be some sort of evolutionary thing.

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.880
 Is it to see if you're like a good match?

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:33.880
 Kind of, yes.

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:38.880
 So the problem is that humans used to spend a lot of time in very small groups.

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:43.880
 And if you decide that you want to get together with someone and they were buff you,

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:46.880
 you can't just move to London.

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:49.880
 And then sort of move to a new place and get a new life or anything.

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:50.880
 You're stuck in that place.

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:57.880
 So the only way to do it is to give very sort of small signals that you can deny if someone says.

00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:59.880
 So it's deny ability, basically.

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:01.880
 That's clever.

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:04.880
 Because there is this thing of lots of people don't know when they're being flirted with.

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:05.880
 Yeah.

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.880
 And I'm afraid Amy, women are especially bad at it.

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:10.880
 It's just your personal opinion.

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:13.880
 You're like, I fly all the time.

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:15.880
 You don't want to give me anything bad.

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:18.880
 Genetically, they're just not good at it.

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:21.880
 Actually, it's women and men.

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:28.880
 So women sort of sometimes under perceive when they're being flirted with and men over perceive it.

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:37.880
 So it will often be like male students when asked that they're like clear than women to misinterpret friendly gestures as sexual interest.

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:41.880
 And many mistake, but many people do mistake sexual cues as amicable signals.

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:46.880
 But often, if you're a straight man, the nervous woman smiling at you is not flirting with you.

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:50.880
 She's nervous and you're thinking, she's flirting with me and women underestimate her.

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:55.880
 And there is a theory that this leads to the idea of the friend zone, which is not a real,

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:58.880
 or it's the idea that the friend zone is not a real thing.

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:00.880
 It's that people are just drastically misinterpreting each other's cues.

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:02.880
 And men are saying, I've been friend zoned.

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:05.880
 And actually, that's not what has happened.

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:08.880
 It's just that she's just not that into you to go on a phrase.

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.880
 And so, yeah, yeah, it's tricky.

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:16.880
 And I think a lot of women, I think you are really having to be friendly if you're like feeling unsafe.

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:20.880
 So you're like, if you're like on a train and a scary man's, it's next to you.

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:26.880
 And he might think he's flirting and you kind of can't say, please don't talk to me.

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:27.880
 I hate this.

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:30.880
 So you have to go like, oh, really?

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:31.880
 Oh, that's nice.

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.880
 He'll be like, she's into it.

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:36.880
 But you're thinking, don't harm me, don't kill me, don't fight.

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:37.880
 I don't where I live.

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:43.880
 But you're, I guess you're giving off kind of friendly-ish signals as a kind of safety device.

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:46.880
 And I guess guys will be like, she loves this.

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:53.880
 There is only one way around this. And that is boys on one side of the road, girls on the other side of the road.

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:55.880
 Yeah, there's subtle links.

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:58.880
 I think any flirting with cakes is fantastic.

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:01.880
 Can I tell you something very quickly that I found that that links in?

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:04.880
 I guess sexy stuff and pizza and poems.

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:05.880
 Oh, yeah.

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:06.880
 Oh, wow.

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:11.880
 Okay. So there was an article that said that pizza hot response a furious whole customer

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:15.880
 who claims ketchup bottle label sounds like swingers app.

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:20.880
 So I was like, well, what the hell are they calling their ketchup and pizza hot?

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.880
 Do you want to guess what they name it?

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:24.880
 Squirties.

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:25.880
 Yeah.

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:28.880
 So they call it shake, squeeze and squirt.

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:31.880
 And he was like, that is too sexual.

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:32.880
 I think it's it.

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:33.880
 It says quite directions.

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.880
 I think it's on a ketchup bottle.

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:36.880
 I think it's not too sexual.

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:37.880
 Yeah.

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:38.880
 Context is all.

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:39.880
 Yeah.

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:40.880
 Yeah.

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:42.880
 It's a penis tattoo.

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:46.880
 If you just tap it on the top, it'll come up.

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:47.880
 Yeah.

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:51.880
 Turn it upside down and bang the bottom really hard.

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:52.880
 It doesn't work.

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:53.880
 Stick enough today.

00:28:53.880 --> 00:29:02.880
 Okay.

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:04.880
 It is time for fact number three.

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:05.880
 And that is my fact.

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:11.880
 My fact this week is that in 1931, Laurel and Hardy simultaneously filmed up to five

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:16.880
 versions of every movie that they made, each time, speaking in a different language,

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:19.880
 despite the fact that they only knew English.

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:20.880
 Lovely.

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:25.880
 But this is this is a fascinating bit of Hollywood, which often doesn't get mentioned,

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:30.880
 which is when it was the silent era, when you were sending movies over to Europe or any other country,

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:31.880
 it was very easy.

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:33.880
 You replaced the card with the words on it, right?

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:37.880
 And so people had these massive fan bases all over the world.

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:40.880
 Laurel and Hardy in particular had a big, big fan base in Spain and Italy.

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.880
 And Italy and other countries in Europe.

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:47.880
 And then when it became the talky movies, suddenly they were not understanding it.

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:50.880
 And they didn't have the technology to do subtitles at the time.

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:55.880
 So what used to happen was, and this was an idea of Hal Roach, who was this amazing movie mogul,

00:29:55.880 --> 00:30:00.880
 he said, we're going to film every single scene of everything you film from now,

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:02.880
 up to five different languages.

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:06.880
 And they had to learn phonetically how to say all of the dialogue.

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:10.880
 There was half an hour of rehearsals for each scene where they had to learn the phrases.

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:14.880
 They had speech coaches of the language there with them telling them to do it.

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:18.880
 You know what I thought when I read this is there's no way they did it very well.

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:21.880
 Because as someone who's learning a language right now,

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:25.880
 you can know exactly how to say something, but you try and say it.

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:27.880
 And so a native speaker, it doesn't quite sound right?

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:29.880
 Yeah, so that's definitely true.

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:32.880
 And I think the interesting thing that was, I read a report about it,

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:40.880
 which said, Spanish audiences took special satisfaction in seeing Laurel Orhardy squirming under the burden of a difficult castellium phrase.

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:44.880
 And so it's sort of almost funnier, seeing knowing that they're having to do it,

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:46.880
 and knowing they can't do it very well.

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.880
 Everyone else was a perfect speaker.

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.880
 So they surrounded them in the different way.

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:52.880
 So all the other actors were perfect.

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:56.880
 I presume, or maybe they subbed in the actors and like said, right, get the Spanish cast in now.

00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:58.880
 They'll do it with them. So yeah, that might have been it.

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:03.880
 A lot of these movies are now lost because they weren't the main thing that people were keeping for posterity, right?

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.880
 Like the English-speaking versions were.

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:07.880
 But it's exactly that. They loved it.

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:11.880
 Laurel Orhardy could just mumble a sentence, you know, that doesn't matter. It's comedy.

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:12.880
 It's fine.

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:13.880
 Yeah.

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:15.880
 We just want to see them falling over with the piano.

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:16.880
 Yeah.

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:21.880
 I bet they knew how to say, oh no, piano in so many different languages.

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:24.880
 Yeah, the thing about piano is it's the same in almost every language.

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:25.880
 Yeah, perfect.

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:31.880
 But yeah, I was thinking about double acts because Amy, you're part of a double act to work.

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:32.880
 Still am.

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:33.880
 Still am.

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:34.880
 The delightful sausage.

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:35.880
 Yeah.

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:36.880
 Yeah.

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:37.880
 It's catchy name.

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:39.880
 We never thought we would be a double act.

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:41.880
 We just needed to run a comedy night together.

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:43.880
 And we said, what should we call it?

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:46.880
 And Chris had literally just had breakfast and he said, that was a delightful sausage.

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:48.880
 And we were like, yeah, yeah, that'll do that.

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:51.880
 Ten years later, we're like, we should have thought about that name just like a bit more.

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:52.880
 It's a great name.

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:53.880
 It's a great name.

00:31:53.880 --> 00:32:00.880
 I mean, the word sausage is the funniest word in the world, which we recently learned as part of no such thing as a fish that the word

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:07.880
 sausage has been in our titles more than any other word out there outside of like with and or so on.

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:08.880
 So number one word.

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:10.880
 So you're onto something.

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:11.880
 Wow.

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:12.880
 Because you could have gone something and something.

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:13.880
 Yeah.

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:14.880
 Something, yeah.

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:17.880
 Like Laurel and Harvey is the classic one, you know, Cannibal, Helen pace, all of that.

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:20.880
 All those things like the mighty bush, where it's not clear that it's a double act.

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:21.880
 Yes.

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:25.880
 I reckon the mighty bush is similar to your name because that's named after his hair, wasn't it?

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:27.880
 Like, you know, you're feeling so active.

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:28.880
 You got a mighty bush.

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:29.880
 Yeah.

00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:30.880
 Oh my god.

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:32.880
 So it's one of you got it.

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:34.880
 He's floating.

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:35.880
 He's floating.

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:36.880
 I feel safe.

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:44.880
 But yeah, Chris does have a huge bush.

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:49.880
 Hey, there's another technique by the way that I've seen a double act using comedy where they don't speak the language.

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:56.880
 Rick Maill and Adrian Edmondson, they often used to speak backwards in their scenes.

00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:06.880
 So guesthouse parodies so their movie, they would speak backwards a line because the comedy stunt that they were doing was so dangerous that it only worked if you played it in reverse.

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:13.880
 So rather than throwing spiky nails into the nose of Rick Maill, you would take them out with him, go.

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:17.880
 And then you would get the line played forward and the scene played forward.

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:20.880
 For me, do you know what the word sausage is backwards?

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:21.880
 Jesus.

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:22.880
 Jesus.

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:23.880
 sausage.

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:25.880
 Oh my god.

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:27.880
 Well, son of, yeah.

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:29.880
 Oh my god.

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:30.880
 Wow.

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:31.880
 Damn it.

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:34.880
 I think guesthouse parodies are about five times.

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:35.880
 I didn't know that.

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:36.880
 I didn't know that.

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:38.880
 It's in the bonus VHS.

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:39.880
 There we go.

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:40.880
 Documentary.

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:45.880
 No one watches the bonuses like you don't.

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:46.880
 It's such a good film.

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:47.880
 It's great.

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:48.880
 Laurel and Hardy.

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:50.880
 Have you seen any of the stuff I mean?

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:57.880
 Yeah, I have seen stuff, but I wouldn't say, you know, is it ridiculous to explain who they are to an audience?

00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:58.880
 I think so.

00:33:58.880 --> 00:33:59.880
 Young people.

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:00.880
 Yeah.

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:01.880
 Comedy double act.

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:10.880
 Stan Oro was tall and thin and legubris looking and Oli Hardy was, and British and Oli Hardy was sort of a big, big fellow with the moustache and

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:16.880
 Laurel was always doing silly things and Oli Hardy was always annoyed with him and they were mega-famous.

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:17.880
 They were sort of globally famous.

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:23.880
 If you name any other, like Silent Moves, like Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, they're in absolutely that sort of echelon.

00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:26.880
 And I'd started looking into their lives.

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:31.880
 So Oliver Hardy had a very interesting early life.

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:33.880
 So his real name was Norvell.

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:38.880
 But his father, Oliver Hardy's dad, fought in the American Civil War.

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:39.880
 Yeah, really?

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:41.880
 What is the timeline of that?

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:42.880
 Isn't that nuts?

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:45.880
 Was it like a hilarious sort of battle that he was in?

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:47.880
 [laughter]

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:50.880
 20,000 people were killed in that custard pie fight.

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:51.880
 Yeah.

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:54.880
 Yeah, no, his father was a sergeant in the Confederate army.

00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:56.880
 That's the 1860s.

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:59.880
 And then Oliver Hardy was born in 1892.

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:00.880
 So it all worked.

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:04.880
 He fought in the Civil War as a very young man, and then 30 years later he had Oliver.

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:08.880
 But like, yeah, it's extraordinary. All his grandfather was a slave owner.

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:09.880
 Right.

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:10.880
 Oh my God.

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:14.880
 The generations you have to go to get back to that period.

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:15.880
 It's so few.

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:16.880
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:17.880
 Yeah.

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:23.880
 He's famous, while we're just mentioning their sort of classic traits, for looking at the camera with a really frustrated face.

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:25.880
 Like the Miranda.

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:28.880
 Like the Miranda looking exactly like that.

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:35.880
 Yeah, yeah. And there's a story that goes that in order to get the best performance out of him,

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:38.880
 Stan Laurel, who was really kind of the mastermind behind the two of them.

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:41.880
 He was the real thinker, the new comedy inside out.

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.880
 He was a James Harkin of that group.

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:44.880
 Yeah, exactly.

00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:45.880
 He was a bossy.

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:47.880
 Yeah, bossy.

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:48.880
 [laughter]

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:50.880
 The kind of guys are pissed on some calls.

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.880
 [laughter]

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:57.880
 So he used to get Hardy to do those frustrated looks into the camera at the end of the day,

00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:01.880
 because he knew that at the end of the day, Hardy wanted to get out of there and get on the golf course.

00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:04.880
 He was like, "I want to play golf," and he would keep him a bit.

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:05.880
 He was a James Harkin.

00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:06.880
 [laughter]

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:07.880
 Exactly.

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:13.880
 And so those frustrated looks were growingly real, because he was like, "I'm meant to be out of here."

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:18.880
 I found some nice things about Stan that I really liked.

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:23.880
 Did you know that he, so he was doing hydroponic gardening that was one of his looks?

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:24.880
 Oh, really?

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:29.880
 And he once crossbred a potato and an onion, but couldn't get anyone to sample the results.

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:30.880
 [laughter]

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:31.880
 That was tragic.

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:33.880
 With his after, he was famous.

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:34.880
 Yeah.

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:35.880
 Wow.

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:36.880
 Yeah.

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:37.880
 I think it sounds a bit weird.

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:38.880
 Like, if you're making a hot pot, you only have to put one thing in.

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:39.880
 Yes.

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:40.880
 [laughter]

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:42.880
 Also, at times, Ava.

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:43.880
 He was from the Lake District.

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:44.880
 Yeah.

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:45.880
 Didn't know that from all sorts of things.

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:46.880
 Oh, I read Overston.

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:47.880
 Oh.

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:48.880
 Is that so?

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:49.880
 Yeah.

00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:50.880
 Very close by.

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:51.880
 They both begin with you.

00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:56.880
 Well, it's now home to what's described as the world's only Laurel and Hardy Museum.

00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:57.880
 It's really weird.

00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:58.880
 There's only one?

00:36:58.880 --> 00:36:59.880
 That is weird.

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:00.880
 It's not weird.

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:01.880
 Why is that not weird?

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:04.880
 It's completely normal there's only one museum dedicated entirely to Laurel and Hardy.

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:06.880
 Okay, maybe there should be two.

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:07.880
 Two tops.

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:08.880
 Two tops.

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:09.880
 Yeah.

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:13.880
 I opened up a Laurel and Hardy cafe and ice cream bar in Kosovo back in 2003.

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:14.880
 What?

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:15.880
 What?

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:17.880
 So, I was going to say when we were describing here.

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:22.880
 So, I think I'm going to say, "Lie, what are you going to say, honey?"

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:23.880
 I'm going with true.

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:24.880
 I think it's true.

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:25.880
 I think it's true.

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:26.880
 I think it's like a double bluff.

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:27.880
 I think it's true.

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:28.880
 What the hell?

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:33.880
 Well, I was saying, and it wasn't my own money that was evolved, but I was living in Kosovo

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:34.880
 when I was 18.

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:38.880
 Who wouldn't back that with being happy at all?

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:40.880
 The dragons are all there.

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:44.880
 They're fighting to get you.

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:45.880
 Are we doing this Kosovo?

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:46.880
 Kosovo.

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:51.880
 Don't I mean, it ends out with a chair shaking your hand.

00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:52.880
 Yes, I'll take it.

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:53.880
 Yes.

00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:54.880
 I'm in.

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:55.880
 I'm all in.

00:37:55.880 --> 00:38:00.880
 There was a guy out there who I became friends with through my grandmother.

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:01.880
 And he was like, "You like covenirs?"

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:02.880
 I was like, "Yeah."

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:04.880
 And he was like, "I'm opening a cafe and I want it to be themed."

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:09.880
 And we spoke about it and we landed on the restaurant, would be the Hardy restaurant.

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:12.880
 And you would have the ice cream bar, which was Stan.

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:17.880
 And so it was all, you know, the images of them were up on the walls.

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:18.880
 And you could buy statues.

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:20.880
 But they were massive in Kosovo.

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:21.880
 Ice statues, of course.

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:22.880
 Yeah.

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:24.880
 I'm not hungry.

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:25.880
 I have a big lunch.

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:31.880
 I'll just have a statue of Oliver Hardy, please.

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:32.880
 Nine in the shot.

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:33.880
 You didn't buy statues of the shot.

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:34.880
 Would I be?

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:35.880
 That'd be crazy.

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:36.880
 Yeah.

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:37.880
 We're just outside W going.

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:38.880
 The next shot.

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:39.880
 The next shot.

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:40.880
 The next shot.

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:42.880
 The wisdom was big in Albania.

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:44.880
 I think you guys might know that they loved him there.

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:48.880
 Oliver Hardy and Stan Laurel huge in that bit of the world as well.

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:49.880
 Is it still trading?

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:50.880
 I don't know.

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:51.880
 I haven't been back for some.

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:52.880
 I imagine it.

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:54.880
 Can't come out of business.

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:59.880
 There's our franchises in every city in the Balkans.

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:08.880
 Okay.

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:09.880
 It's time for our final fact of the show.

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:10.880
 And that is James.

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:11.880
 Okay.

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:17.880
 My fact this week is that the character of Aunt Bessie was invented in 1994 to stop people mistaking

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:20.880
 Yorkshire puddings for nuclear weapons.

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:22.880
 Quick question.

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:23.880
 Yeah.

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:24.880
 Who's Aunt Bessie?

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:27.880
 I can't believe that you don't know who Aunt Bessie is.

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:28.880
 Educate the boy.

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:33.880
 Aunt Bessie is a maternal figure who makes Yorkshire puddings.

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:35.880
 She's like the patron saint of Hol.

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:36.880
 Yeah.

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:37.880
 Okay.

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:38.880
 Yeah.

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:40.880
 I can't believe she's not widely known.

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:41.880
 Never heard of her.

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:43.880
 But she's not real, right?

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:44.880
 She's not real.

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:49.880
 No, she was invented in 1994 to stop people mistaking Yorkshire puddings for nuclear weapons.

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:50.880
 Right.

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:55.880
 So up until that point, when you go to Sunday lunch and go, "Whoa, everyone out, everyone out!"

00:39:55.880 --> 00:40:00.880
 Well, it's worse because when they were trying the nuclear tests off, they just threw a big

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:01.880
 Yorkshire puddings into it.

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:06.880
 Like a lot of Hawaiian islands were destroyed by massive Yorkshire puddings being dropped

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:07.880
 over.

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:12.880
 So, basically, this company that makes Yorkshire puddings was originally called Triton.

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:17.880
 They're based in Hol and they did market research and found that people associated the name Triton

00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:20.880
 with the UK's nuclear deterrent, which is Triton.

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:21.880
 Yeah.

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:24.880
 And only 4% of people associated the word with Yorkshire puddings.

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:29.880
 So they decided to come up with a new brand and that new brand was Aunt Bessie.

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:30.880
 Yeah.

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:34.880
 And they are the biggest makers of Yorkshire pudding, probably in the world, but definitely in Britain.

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:35.880
 Yeah.

00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:36.880
 And they make millions of them.

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:40.880
 They can't be anywhere outside Britain that makes more Yorkshire puddings than Britain.

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:41.880
 Yeah.

00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:44.880
 You know, sometimes you just find out, "Oh, it happens that they're massive."

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:45.880
 Yeah.

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:46.880
 It's like Kosovo.

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:47.880
 There's this huge factory.

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:49.880
 It's themed around Harold Lloyd.

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:50.880
 And it's...

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:51.880
 Yeah.

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:55.880
 Instead of custard pies, we use Yorkshire puddings in the restaurant.

00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:56.880
 Yeah.

00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:00.880
 Should we say what are Yorkshire puddings for international listeners?

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:01.880
 Okay.

00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:04.880
 For those of you not in Yorkshire or Bolivia, it is...

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:08.880
 It's batter, so that's flour and water and eggs.

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:15.880
 And you get some hot oil and you make it really, really hot and then you put the batter into it

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:20.880
 and it puffs up into a delicious crispy thing that you eat with meat and gravy.

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:22.880
 You can have them as desserts as well, you know.

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:23.880
 Oh, yeah.

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:24.880
 Yeah, you can put ice cream in.

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:25.880
 Have you done that?

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:26.880
 Yeah, it's really cool.

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:29.880
 It's actually the best day ever.

00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:34.880
 We had, we went for a roast dinner in London, actually, it wasn't even in the north.

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:39.880
 We had a Sunday lunch with huge Yorkshire puddings and then on the menu,

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:43.880
 you can get Yorkshire puddings with three scoops of ice cream in.

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:44.880
 It was fantastic.

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:45.880
 It was fantastic.

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:46.880
 It's like a waffle.

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:47.880
 It's like a pancake, isn't it, really?

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:49.880
 It feels decadent that sort of, you know.

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:52.880
 Because is that still made with beef dripping?

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:54.880
 Are you adding ice cream to beef dripping?

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:55.880
 I presume so, yes.

00:41:55.880 --> 00:42:01.880
 I've got to say that is a step two northern for me.

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:05.880
 Have you been to the factory that makes them?

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:07.880
 I've driven past it a million times.

00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:08.880
 I've never been there.

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:09.880
 Oh, interesting.

00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:11.880
 This is an interesting question for you.

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:15.880
 People who work there, some of them have reported that as they drive past,

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:20.880
 even if they work in a different industry, they feel the call of the factory to work there.

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:21.880
 Wow.

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:22.880
 What are you talking about?

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:27.880
 So the factories Yorkshire pudding guru, as he's known, David Barr,

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:28.880
 that's how he ended up working there.

00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:29.880
 He used to work in fish.

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:33.880
 He was always in the fish industry and he used to pass it every day and he thought,

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:35.880
 "Oh, I feel I need to be in there."

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:38.880
 And he applied three times for the job.

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:42.880
 What's that movie where they sort of make the spaceship out of mashed potatoes?

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:43.880
 Close and close to the...

00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:46.880
 This is like the Yorkshire version of that.

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:47.880
 Yeah, exactly.

00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:48.880
 Yeah.

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:51.880
 No, he felt the calling and he went for three interviews and he failed the first two.

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:56.880
 And he said, finally, he got the job when they just asked him why he wanted to join the company

00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:58.880
 and he went, "I just love Yorkshire puddings."

00:42:58.880 --> 00:42:59.880
 And they're like, "You're in."

00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:01.880
 And he's now literally the top of the heap.

00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:02.880
 He is the man.

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:03.880
 He's the guru.

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:04.880
 He's his title there.

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:06.880
 Is that Willy Wonka of Yorkshire pudding?

00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:07.880
 Yeah, exactly.

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:08.880
 That's a good film.

00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:10.880
 I mean, it's pretty crazy, isn't it?

00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:12.880
 Like, the amount that they produce.

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:17.880
 Every day, they use more than half a million eggs in order to make...

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:22.880
 This is in the Christmas season where it really ramps up and they have to bring in more staff

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:23.880
 of all felt the calling.

00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:25.880
 It's a pretty incredible process.

00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:26.880
 It's like a wonderland.

00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:29.880
 And what do you think do you toss?

00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:32.880
 Like, visitors can go because I would genuinely be interested in going.

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:34.880
 I'm sure your career has allowed you now.

00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:35.880
 Do you think?

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:37.880
 Do you think I've got the key to the factory?

00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:38.880
 You've got the poll.

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:41.880
 What's the point of getting all these awards?

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:45.880
 And all these amazing podcasts, if you can't then get into the Yorkshire pudding party.

00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:48.880
 You've got a whole second greatest comedy double act.

00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:51.880
 Of course you're getting it.

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:54.880
 I'm sorry, Hailey and Pace are geniuses.

00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:55.880
 And they from Hull.

00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:57.880
 Gareth Hailey is from Hull, yeah.

00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:58.880
 Yeah, yeah.

00:43:58.880 --> 00:43:59.880
 Born and raised.

00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:00.880
 What if he's been to the factory?

00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:01.880
 Of course he has.

00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:02.880
 He's got a key.

00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:03.880
 He's got a key.

00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:04.880
 He's got a key.

00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:05.880
 He's got a key.

00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:06.880
 He's probably shagged out.

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:07.880
 Bessie, he's...

00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:08.880
 Wow.

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:10.880
 Can I ask you something about Hull?

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:11.880
 Yes, please.

00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:16.880
 Hull got listed as part of Lonely Planets 500 travel experiences in the UK.

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:19.880
 Unmissable experiences and hidden plans.

00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:22.880
 You made one entry in the 500.

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:24.880
 You were listed 483.

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:26.880
 And it was a public toilet.

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:27.880
 No.

00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:28.880
 Yeah.

00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:29.880
 What's the experience to have?

00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:30.880
 It's secret.

00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:35.880
 It was Victoria Peer's public toilet.

00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:36.880
 Have you been?

00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:37.880
 Yeah.

00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:38.880
 Is it good?

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:39.880
 No.

00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:40.880
 But is it historical?

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:43.880
 Yeah, it's kind of beautiful, but the outside.

00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:46.880
 But if you actually use the toilet itself, you're harrowing.

00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:48.880
 You're not going to be pissing in the sauna.

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:49.880
 I don't think it is.

00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:53.880
 If you had a genuinely fair choice, would 100% go for the sauna?

00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:55.880
 At least then you're in a sauna.

00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:56.880
 Yeah.

00:44:56.880 --> 00:45:00.880
 It's actually a good way of getting rid of human excruence, isn't it, in a way?

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:01.880
 A sauna.

00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:04.880
 Yeah, like it means you don't have to have drains or anything,

00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:06.880
 because it just evaporates.

00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:07.880
 You breathe it all in.

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:08.880
 You breathe in that piss.

00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:09.880
 That's what I'm saying.

00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:10.880
 But it's number one, sadly.

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:11.880
 Yeah.

00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:12.880
 It's number one, sadly.

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:17.880
 We're going to have to update that sign.

00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:19.880
 That sign.

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:24.880
 Imagine the disdain of the person writing, "Oh, shit."

00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:27.880
 Don't baby right, or ejaculate.

00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:28.880
 You taxi drivers.

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:29.880
 We're one of you taxi drivers.

00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:30.880
 We're one of you taxi drivers.

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:31.880
 We're one of you taxi drivers.

00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:32.880
 We're one of you taxi drivers.

00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:33.880
 We're one of you taxi drivers.

00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:34.880
 We're one of you taxi drivers.

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:35.880
 We're one of you taxi drivers.

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:36.880
 Oh my god.

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:38.880
 Oh my god.

00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:39.880
 Hold patty.

00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:40.880
 Patty butty.

00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:41.880
 Yeah.

00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:42.880
 You've got a red one.

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:43.880
 No, I never have.

00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:44.880
 What's a patty butty?

00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:45.880
 What?

00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:47.880
 You don't know what a patty butty is.

00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:48.880
 I like the shirt.

00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:51.880
 I like how that hollets the wrong end of the M62.

00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:54.880
 If you end up there, you've gone seriously wrong.

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:56.880
 Yeah, you've really gone wrong there.

00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:59.880
 So a patty is a potato.

00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:05.880
 It's like mashed potato with lovely herbs in deep fries.

00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:07.880
 Deep fried to make it sort of like a...

00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:09.880
 It's almost like a potato fritter.

00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:10.880
 Yeah.

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:14.880
 But then you have it in a breadcake or a bread bun or however you want to say that.

00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:17.880
 And you pack vinegar onto it till it's dripping.

00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:18.880
 And it's fantastic.

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:19.880
 That sounds good.

00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:20.880
 That sounds good.

00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:21.880
 Oh, it's so good.

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:22.880
 It's a really traditional hull dish.

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:23.880
 Yeah.

00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:25.880
 It's traditionally made by the maidens of hull.

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:26.880
 By hand.

00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:30.880
 Did they roll it on their thighs like the Cubans are girls.

00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:31.880
 Yeah.

00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:35.880
 Just wipe the oil off on your thighs.

00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:36.880
 Oh my God.

00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:38.880
 It's very hard to tell sometimes if you're in hull or hervana.

00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:42.880
 But if you smell the vinegar, that's what you know.

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:45.880
 You know your flirting's gone well where you can smell the vinegar.

00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:48.880
 I'm not a hull maiden.

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:53.880
 But there was this whole group of women and they were called patty slappers.

00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:54.880
 No.

00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:55.880
 Wow.

00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:56.880
 That was a drop.

00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:58.880
 I just wondered, is that known in hull?

00:46:58.880 --> 00:46:59.880
 I didn't know that.

00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:02.880
 I just got a new idea for a show.

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:05.880
 Wow.

00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:07.880
 That's incredible.

00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:09.880
 You've got the lemsip factory.

00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:10.880
 We've got the lemsip factory.

00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:11.880
 Really.

00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:12.880
 Isn't that cool?

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:13.880
 I don't know.

00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:14.880
 I owe a great deal.

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:15.880
 I owe a great deal.

00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:16.880
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:17.880
 Racket.

00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:18.880
 Is the firm on it?

00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:19.880
 Yeah.

00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:20.880
 That's very cool.

00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:23.880
 Actually, there's quite a fun thing which was this team called the drunk animal creative studio.

00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:28.880
 Set up these things of alternative blue plaques to commemorate the locals had done interesting things.

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:29.880
 Have you seen those?

00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:32.880
 I think I've, yeah, I think I've heard of it.

00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:33.880
 But I don't know.

00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:34.880
 I don't know if I've seen any.

00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:41.880
 So like an example would be on this spot last Monday, Tom Piper got lucky.

00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:42.880
 That was one.

00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:43.880
 Yeah.

00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:44.880
 Here was one.

00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:50.880
 Ronnie Pickering, 2015, became an internet sensation near here for his red citron Picasso.

00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:51.880
 The citron hull, really Pickering.

00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:52.880
 Yeah, he's from home.

00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:53.880
 Yeah.

00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:54.880
 That's amazing.

00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:55.880
 That's a bit.

00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:56.880
 You know Ronnie Pickering, but you don't know.

00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:58.960
 - This is wild. (laughing)

00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:00.880
 - It's not best if you maybe threaten someone from a car.

00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:02.520
 Maybe I wonder what I'm gonna do.

00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:06.520
 - I'm not a fucking bestie. (laughing)

00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:10.800
 - Beep, beep, beep. (laughing)

00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:14.960
 - Oh, good. - And that's so cool.

00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:16.720
 - Yeah, they're really fun. - It's lovely.

00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:18.960
 - There's a really cool hero as well called Carl Buschby.

00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:20.800
 Have you heard of him from Hall?

00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:23.720
 He decided in 1998 he was gonna walk the world, right?

00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:26.160
 So he started in Chile and the idea was to end up

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:27.400
 back in Hall.

00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:29.160
 So it was gonna take him 10 years.

00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:31.480
 So he should have been back in 2010.

00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:33.040
 - He's still walking. - Did he?

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:34.240
 - Yeah, why? - Did he not realize

00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:36.560
 that the Atlantic Ocean is in between those two places?

00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:39.000
 - Yeah, yeah, it's a bit of a problem.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.120
 - There must be a land bridge here, something.

00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:42.440
 (laughing)

00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:43.660
 - He had so many problems.

00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:47.120
 He's expected to end it in September of next year.

00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:49.000
 He's still walking. - Do we know where he is?

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.680
 - He was just walking through Turkey

00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:53.960
 and I think he's just crossed the border now.

00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:54.800
 So that's good. - That's good.

00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:57.520
 - I mean, it's been really hard because you had to have,

00:48:57.520 --> 00:48:59.920
 you know, three month of eases were a problem

00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:01.360
 when you were walking Russia.

00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:02.640
 You know, like that wasn't it?

00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:04.760
 - I'll tell you what, if he's coming up from Turkey,

00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:06.560
 you know where he's about to go past.

00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:08.200
 - Wow. - Kosovo.

00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:10.400
 - You've got Carl, Carl, you've got to go.

00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:11.680
 - Carl, use your coach, driver,

00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:14.200
 and you'll get yourself a pretty statue.

00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:15.360
 (laughing)

00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:17.680
 Stan, not Ollie.

00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:20.520
 (laughing)

00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:23.260
 (upbeat music)

00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:27.100
 - Okay, that's it, that is all of our facts.

00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:28.480
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:30.500
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:32.020
 about the things that we've said over the course

00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:33.960
 of this podcast, we can all be found

00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:35.460
 on our social media accounts.

00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:37.580
 I'm on Instagram, on @Sriberland.

00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:39.100
 James. - My Instagram is no such thing

00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:40.100
 as James Harkin.

00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:41.380
 Andy. - I'm on Instagram.

00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:42.400
 I'm @Amy.

00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:43.500
 - And Amy.

00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:47.300
 - I am @ThatAmyGladhill on Instagram.

00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:50.260
 - Yeah, and also if you wanna hear any of Amy's podcasts,

00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:51.500
 Amy, where did they go?

00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:54.500
 - Well, I think there would be a good Venn diagram overlap

00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:58.420
 with Northern News podcast, as James and Andrew have both

00:49:58.420 --> 00:50:00.220
 done that, but have been brilliant guests on it.

00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:03.600
 And we find news stories from the North,

00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:06.700
 silly funny ones, and we have a laugh about them.

00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:08.940
 And then if you're interested in the flirting

00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:10.980
 what we've talked about, I also do single ladies

00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:13.900
 in your area, and that is about being single

00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:14.900
 and how hard that is.

00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:18.380
 - It's actually, but it's fun and it's light-hearted.

00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:19.220
 - Nice.

00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:20.620
 - And Dan, maybe you can come on that one

00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:22.420
 'cause if we've had these two on Northern News

00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:23.860
 you could be a guest on single ladies.

00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:28.340
 - Okay, I am a single lady, so that makes sense.

00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:31.300
 But yeah, so definitely go listen to those.

00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:33.860
 And if you wanna write into us as a group

00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:36.860
 about any of the things that we've said on this podcast

00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:40.860
 you can do that by writing to podcast@QI.com.

00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:42.820
 All the emails make their way to Andy.

00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:44.500
 He loves to cherry pick the best of them

00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:47.100
 and they head towards our extra bonus show

00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:50.460
 that is sitting in our Special Members Club Club Fish.

00:50:50.460 --> 00:50:51.940
 It's called Drop Us Align.

00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:54.660
 So send them there, we'll read them out and discuss them.

00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:56.060
 If you haven't joined Club Fish

00:50:56.060 --> 00:50:57.980
 head to nosuchthingasaffish.com.

00:50:57.980 --> 00:50:59.340
 All of the details are there.

00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:01.620
 We'll send you to Patreon, check it out,

00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:02.740
 be part of the club.

00:51:02.740 --> 00:51:04.940
 Otherwise, do just come back here next week

00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:06.740
 'cause we're gonna be back with another episode.

00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:09.260
 We'll see you then, goodbye.

00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:11.840
 (upbeat music)

00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:14.420
 (upbeat music)

00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:17.840
