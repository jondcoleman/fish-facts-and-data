00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,320
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing There's a Fish

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:07,520
 where we were joined by one of my favourite guests we've ever had.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,520
 I mean, I love them all.

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,360
 Mmm.

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,120
 And even though this one's from Yorkshire, I thought she was brilliant.

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:13,920
 Fighting talk.

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,440
 Uh, yes, it's the brilliant Amy Gledhill.

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,600
 Um, you don't want to miss this episode.

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,200
 You're already listening to it, so don't worry.

10
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,480
 But it was so much fun to record.

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,000
 Amy is absolutely terrific.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,080
 It's just really, really fun.

13
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:25,760
 We hope you like it.

14
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,320
 The main thing she wanted to let us know about

15
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,440
 was two podcasts that she made. One is called Single Ladies in Your Area,

16
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,240
 which is her and Harriet Kenzley, and the other is Northern News,

17
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,200
 which actually, James and I have both been on.

18
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,800
 It's her and Ian Smith.

19
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,080
 And it's so funny.

20
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:41,840
 It's so funny.

21
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,240
 It's just a brilliant show.

22
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,360
 It's so good.

23
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,760
 She didn't really say that we should mention this,

24
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,880
 but we should say also, next year,

25
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,240
 she's going to be on the last one laughing,

26
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,120
 is it cold, which everyone loves this year.

27
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,280
 The second season is coming out,

28
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,960
 she's going to be one of the stars of that.

29
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,200
 So she's absolutely brilliant comedian.

30
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,480
 You're going to love this show.

31
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,320
 You're going to love the 50-minute version,

32
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,720
 which is right here.

33
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,240
 But if you'd like to hear even more Amy,

34
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,560
 then there is a chance to do that.

35
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,920
 And that is by joining our Patreon @ThePlentyMoreFishTier,

36
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,160
 because in that place, not only will you get longer episodes of fish,

37
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:20,360
 you will also get videos of our super duper mailbox show, Drop us a Line.

38
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:20,880
 That's right.

39
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,560
 If you want more fish, if you want ad-free fish,

40
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,520
 you want bonus content, Club Fish is the place to join.

42
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,400
 We've been having an absolute blast making lots of new stuff for that.

43
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,440
 Go there and check it out. It's so much fun.

44
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,160
 But in the meantime, enjoy this show,

45
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,960
 and honestly, there is a moment in this show

46
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,000
 where I've known Dan for 20 years,

47
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,600
 and he told me an anecdote about his life that I cannot believe.

48
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,080
 You'll know it when you hear it.

49
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,240
 Oh, in the podcast.

50
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,160
 On with the show.

51
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,560
 [BELL RINGING]

52
00:01:52,560 --> 00:02:06,560
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing As A Fish,"

53
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,160
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Hobern.

54
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,400
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

55
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,400
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin,

56
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,680
 and Amy Gladhill.

57
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,600
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

58
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,520
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

59
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,720
 and in a particular order, here we go.

60
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,560
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Amy.

61
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,040
 Ah, okay.

62
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:33,040
 In North Carolina, it's illegal to play Bingo for six hours straight.

63
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,640
 [LAUGHTER]

64
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,680
 I'm sorry if that's sad news for any of you.

65
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,000
 Did you learn this the hard way?

66
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,840
 [LAUGHTER]

67
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,440
 I just found out, present this morning.

68
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,720
 It was real.

69
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,680
 Once you're into Bingo, you can't just stop.

70
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,040
 If you're mid-game and it hits the six-hour point,

71
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,280
 you meant to just duck out.

72
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,360
 Yeah, yeah.

73
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,560
 I learned there's a game of Bingo.

74
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,360
 It's a long time since I played Bingo.

75
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:53,960
 Is it?

76
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,920
 I played at university a few times.

77
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,400
 Is it-- it can't be-- it's multiple games, surely, right?

78
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,520
 It can't just be one game.

79
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,480
 What depends on the delivery?

80
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,680
 You know, like the caller can go as slow as he or she likes.

81
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,920
 Yeah, right, you know.

82
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,320
 I found that there is actually a Bingo caller

83
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,720
 of the year competition.

84
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,520
 Oh.

85
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,600
 Yeah.

86
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,680
 And each region--

87
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,480
 I think it's been six regions.

88
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,240
 Each region, you get 10 finalists,

89
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,640
 and then they literally compete like in a live event.

90
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,480
 In it, it says, to be a winner.

91
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,720
 You need to be a bit of a showman or woman, a performer.

92
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,840
 You need to enjoy the attention and want to make people smile.

93
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,560
 But you also need to know when to be authoritative, as well.

94
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,000
 An extra talent, such as singing or comedy,

95
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,960
 doesn't hurt either.

96
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,480
 Who's doing a song?

97
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,320
 Be the Bingo!

98
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,800
 If you were down to one number, and your heart's racing,

99
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,600
 and then someone's like, make a comeback,

100
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,920
 and laugh, make a laugh.

101
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,880
 Come on!

102
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,040
 Do we know if the callers in the call of the year

103
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,560
 are they allowed to come up with different calls?

104
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,960
 Like, legs 11, they can do something else.

105
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,280
 So interesting.

106
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,680
 Because I found in other countries,

107
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,040
 sometimes they have different calls when they do Bingo.

108
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,280
 Right.

109
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,440
 I found that in Russia, they have drumsticks

110
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,240
 instead of legs 11.

111
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:11,720
 And for 40, they say, "Ali Baba," because he had 40 thieves.

112
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,880
 And when they say, "43," now, when I was younger,

113
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,200
 the Bingo collar would say, "Down on your knees, 43."

114
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,080
 I'm not really sure what that meant.

115
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,160
 But in Russia, apparently, they say, "Stalingrad, 43."

116
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,080
 Oh!

117
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,240
 "Jews, the World War II battle were two million people were killed."

118
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,480
 So there's a bit grim, isn't it?

119
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,320
 Wow.

120
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,160
 Yeah.

121
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,480
 I love the calls.

122
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,720
 Because I've never played Bingo.

123
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,240
 So--

124
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,080
 Have you?

125
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,760
 No, what?

126
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,280
 I've never met my life like Bingo.

127
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,720
 Have I got a nice help for you?

128
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,400
 Oh, now that I know all the calls, I'd love it.

129
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,480
 Number-- what's--

130
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,480
 Number six, Tom Mix.

131
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,560
 Do you know who Tom Mix is?

132
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,080
 No.

133
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,360
 How is Tom Mix made it into Bingo calling?

134
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,360
 He was never in it where I used to do--

135
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,560
 I've never heard of Tom Mix.

136
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,440
 Tom Mix, he's massive.

137
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,960
 He was like American cowboy actor.

138
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,240
 He inspired John Wayne and all these other people.

139
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,640
 He's on the cover of "Sorgeon Peppers Lonely Heartbreak."

140
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,240
 Yeah, he's one of the cutouts.

141
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,000
 Tom Mix.

142
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,920
 You could have, like, Stevie Nicks.

143
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,640
 Stevie Nicks.

144
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,400
 Little mix.

145
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,160
 Little mix.

146
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,080
 I'll tell Dix, I was going to say.

147
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:13,920
 Who's I'll tell Dix?

148
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,400
 I'll tell Dix.

149
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,280
 Good question.

150
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,120
 [LAUGHTER]

151
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,440
 Well, yeah, a lot of the-- you find, when you look at the calls,

152
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,520
 a lot of them date back to the 1920s and '30s.

153
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,440
 Yeah, it's not a game that has moved at the time.

154
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:24,960
 Yeah.

155
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,520
 There are occasional attempts to update

156
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,880
 what they call Bingo Lingo.

157
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,760
 Oh, yeah.

158
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,880
 There was a report five years ago and it's completely

159
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,360
 jumped up by a Bingo company.

160
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,560
 Like, that woke millennials were abandoning

161
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,000
 the traditional calls, and they were being updated instead.

162
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,720
 So 38.

163
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,480
 Avocado on a plate.

164
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,480
 No.

165
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,920
 No, no, no, no.

166
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,960
 49.

167
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,480
 Time to buy a house.

168
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,480
 Oh, no, it doesn't work.

169
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,520
 She's unwind.

170
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,440
 I'll call free wine.

171
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,200
 I was going to say Amazon Prime.

172
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,160
 [LAUGHTER]

173
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,280
 Seven.

174
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,560
 And don't pay any attention to the rhyme here.

175
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,640
 It won't help you.

176
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,640
 [LAUGHTER]

177
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,640
 The number of David Beckham when he played for Man United.

178
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,160
 That's it?

179
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,760
 Oh, it's a Beckham name.

180
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,840
 David Beckham, number seven.

181
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,040
 Yeah, that is good.

182
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,000
 It works, it's not bad, yeah.

183
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,160
 It's better than the rhyme they came up with.

184
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,160
 OK.

185
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,240
 Seven Flexitarian.

186
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,200
 Flexitarian.

187
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,200
 What's that?

188
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,280
 Someone who is vegetarian, but has a bit of meat sometimes.

189
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,440
 Yeah.

190
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,440
 Yeah, OK.

191
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,360
 Can I say number seven?

192
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,320
 [LAUGHTER]

193
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,920
 I'm just going back to North Carolina about why it's illegal

194
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,160
 to play Six Hours Straight.

195
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,400
 Basically, all gambling was illegal in North Carolina.

196
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,240
 But then there was this thing about charities

197
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,600
 wanting to do bingo.

198
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,680
 So they had to make it legal so the charities could do it.

199
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,600
 But they didn't want to encourage people to open bingo holes

200
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,400
 where people get them all the time.

201
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,720
 So they put in these really tight restrictions.

202
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,080
 So as well as only being able to play for five hours

203
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,000
 at a time, you're not allowed to games of bingo

204
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 within a 48-hour period of each other

205
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,560
 to be held in the same building, right?

206
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,480
 And also, no alcohol out, which kind of defeats the point,

207
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,440
 I think, really.

208
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,760
 So I didn't think it was a boozy thing.

209
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,080
 I think of it as being the tea time.

210
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,080
 No.

211
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,120
 Well, these days, they have bingo nights out

212
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,040
 that you can go on, which are really boozy.

213
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,640
 And so do you play bingo?

214
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,480
 Oh, yeah.

215
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,480
 Do you?

216
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,600
 Oh, yeah.

217
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,000
 I was so cynical about it until about five years ago.

218
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,480
 I was like, who's going to bingo wash?

219
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,280
 Stupid night out?

220
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,960
 Who cares if you've got a number on a thing

221
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,800
 and you dabbing, you dabbing on it?

222
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,760
 And then I went, and it was the most exhilarating thing

223
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,680
 I've ever done.

224
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,480
 Really?

225
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,720
 Well, it's absolutely incredible, like I'm getting goosebumps

226
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,800
 thinking about bingo.

227
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,480
 It's because it's hard.

228
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,080
 It's like, it's hard to do, which I didn't expect.

229
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,680
 Is it?

230
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,560
 Look, I know you're all very intelligent.

231
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,560
 Bingo is hard.

232
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,800
 And bingo's all the numbers.

233
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,640
 I know.

234
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,040
 I know the first hundred.

235
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,840
 I do know the first hundred.

236
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,680
 And you only need to 90, so you're going to be fine.

237
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,280
 Oh, really?

238
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,320
 And it goes up to 90, yeah.

239
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,920
 But it's fast, and it's quick, and they take no prisoners.

240
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,400
 And if you go, oh, so what was, they've moved on.

241
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,400
 Really?

242
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,400
 Much like it's Starlengrad.

243
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,200
 No prisoners taken there.

244
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,480
 What is it like?

245
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,280
 So the kind you were playing that was so exciting.

246
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,040
 Yeah.

247
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,280
 Was it?

248
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,200
 I don't-- I'm not trying to--

249
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,160
 I'm not trying to be mean or anything.

250
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,280
 What's it?

251
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,400
 Classic bingo, which I would think of as, like,

252
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,680
 blue rinse bingo.

253
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,200
 Yeah.

254
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,360
 I'm saying, like, like, fill it all.

255
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,360
 Yeah.

256
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,320
 And you might have been one of the younger clientele.

257
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,360
 I love the way that you're trying to do that.

258
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,520
 What's it in the North, Alie?

259
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,520
 What's it in the North?

260
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,600
 Was it elderly ladies in the North?

261
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,400
 It was elderly ladies in the North.

262
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,080
 We all had chips and gravy.

263
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,240
 There was lots of cups of tea, rattling on the table.

264
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,480
 And then it was silence, like I have never heard before,

265
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,600
 when they go, eyes down for a full house.

266
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,680
 And everyone pin drops it.

267
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,120
 You can hate people's heartbeats.

268
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,800
 It's so exciting.

269
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,800
 It's so exciting.

270
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,800
 It's so exciting.

271
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,320
 Yeah, yeah.

272
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,400
 How can we get disabled seats to eat?

273
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,400
 What was that?

274
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,240
 No way, oh god, you missed the goal.

275
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,120
 My way.

276
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,120
 Oh, no!

277
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,960
 I could see how, like, you could just be in it

278
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,120
 and come out and six hours have gone.

279
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,280
 It's only you and 17 granny's are being incarcerated.

280
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,480
 [LAUGHTER]

281
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,080
 Yeah.

282
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,800
 Because I know there are nights now that are things like--

283
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,080
 well, friend of mine was the first ever host of rebel bingo.

284
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,120
 And there's bonkers bingo.

285
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,480
 There's bongos bingo.

286
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,840
 And they're sort of big, they're like club nights.

287
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,640
 They're club nights.

288
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,440
 Combined with bingo.

289
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,400
 Full club nights, then.

290
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:37,920
 Yeah.

291
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,440
 But they don't sound awful on them.

292
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,640
 No, I actually think your bluerin's bingo is--

293
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,680
 like, it's a genuinely exhilarating night out.

294
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,000
 We should go on a group outing.

295
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,080
 I don't think we'd be accepted.

296
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,040
 Because we would make noise, and they would have like it.

297
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,520
 We just want to chat to each other.

298
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:57,920
 Yeah.

299
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,760
 We do when we're out.

300
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,520
 And if you make the single sound--

301
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,320
 you'll be leaving over.

302
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,160
 Interesting thing about the number 37.

303
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:03,480
 Yes.

304
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,480
 I can tell you, as a last graduate, you are.

305
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,680
 Tom Mix was actually on the front of Sarge in front of us.

306
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,720
 [LAUGHTER]

307
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,320
 So like, the modern bingo renaissance, let's say,

308
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,560
 I think came from mecha bingo, right?

309
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,320
 So anyone in the towns of the UK

310
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,360
 will probably have had a mecha bingo, or probably still do.

311
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,760
 And this was invented by Eric Morley.

312
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,360
 He also invented strictly condensing.

313
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:29,880
 Oh, wow.

314
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,920
 Same guy.

315
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,840
 Because he ran the load of dance halls.

316
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,880
 And so he wanted to get dance halls to be big.

317
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,560
 So he did strictly.

318
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,920
 And also, when dance halls became less popular,

319
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,760
 he brought bingo in there.

320
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,200
 And in 1951, he hosted, and was in charge

321
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,840
 of the first Miss World contest, as well, Eric Morley.

322
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,720
 Legs 11.

323
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,720
 Yes.

324
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,800
 [LAUGHTER]

325
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,560
 No fat lady.

326
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,440
 It was--

327
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,320
 [LAUGHTER]

328
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,880
 The winner was Kiki Hackinson from Sweden.

329
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,160
 She was crowned wearing her bikini.

330
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,640
 And the whole event was condemned by friend of the podcast,

331
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,720
 Pope Pius XII, who said that the whole thing was completely

332
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,320
 sinful and it's really allowed.

333
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,520
 And then it basically said the bikini itself was sinful.

334
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,280
 Wow.

335
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:13,920
 You know?

336
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,240
 Yeah.

337
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,560
 Was he wrong with outside?

338
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,960
 But comes to condensing.

339
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,800
 The TV show is strictly condensing dancing with the stars.

340
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,320
 His family are basically still earning off the back of that.

341
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,120
 Morley's family.

342
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,520
 Morley's family.

343
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:32,400
 And rather excitingly, he was born in Hobern.

344
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:37,320
 We are within minutes walk of the birth place.

345
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,680
 Is there a blue plaque?

346
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,200
 I don't know.

347
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:39,800
 There better be.

348
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,320
 I doubt it.

349
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,720
 Macabingo got in a bit of trouble, actually.

350
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,520
 Around 1997.

351
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,960
 Can you guess why?

352
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,080
 In 1997.

353
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,320
 That won't help you.

354
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:55,680
 Is it something to do with Muslim people praying?

355
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,520
 It is.

356
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,360
 Is it really?

357
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:03,520
 It's basically, there were some protests by Muslims saying,

358
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,000
 we don't really think this name is on.

359
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,920
 Oh, yeah, thank you.

360
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,840
 Our religion doesn't really go in for gambling.

361
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,280
 Actually, no, I think about it.

362
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,760
 I think they have a good pipe there.

363
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,320
 Yeah, it was in Luton.

364
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,560
 And I think maybe they'd opened up in Luton, Macabingo, I mean.

365
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,680
 And so I think there's quite big Muslim population there.

366
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,040
 And so there were lots of prizes.

367
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,160
 There were bricks through the windows.

368
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,440
 I'm afraid it all got a bit, it all got a bit tense for a while.

369
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,440
 But it is the holiest city in Islam.

370
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,200
 Yes, but it's also the catchphrase.

371
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,800
 And what it just meant was like, this is a mecca for shopping.

372
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,040
 Or this is only ideal, this is a mecca for dancing.

373
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,080
 It just means this is somewhere you go when you want to dance.

374
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,640
 But obviously, where does that word come from?

375
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,240
 I suspect it comes from the fact it's the holiest city in Islam.

376
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,640
 So it led to say, and they said, right, we'll change our name.

377
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,800
 And then they didn't.

378
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,800
 Right.

379
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,800
 Really?

380
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,320
 And 30 years later, it's fine.

381
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,080
 And it's still going.

382
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,920
 Wow.

383
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,280
 Eric Morley, he was part of the British sort of raising of Bingo.

384
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:58,720
 But in America, there was an entirely different person called Edwin S. Low,

385
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,160
 who made it massive there.

386
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,880
 And he saw it as a game that was being played in carnivals.

387
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,840
 And he thought, this is an amazing idea.

388
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,320
 And it wasn't originally called Bingo in America.

389
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,360
 In fact, it had an even more British name that you could imagine.

390
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,920
 It was called Bino.

391
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,920
 Bino.

392
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,280
 Bino was the original name of Bingo.

393
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,440
 You know, it was like an American word for a party, isn't it?

394
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,200
 Yes.

395
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,040
 That's right.

396
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,880
 But you know, yeah, like a bean feast, I guess.

397
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,680
 Yeah.

398
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,360
 Wow.

399
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,560
 Good old bean feast.

400
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,800
 You don't get enough of a feast there.

401
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,400
 Can I tell you a couple of quick calls that are specifically military?

402
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,360
 Oh, OK.

403
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:37,120
 Because a lot of it dates back to the early 20th century or even the late 19th century.

404
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:44,320
 And the army had allowed Bingo, partly because they wanted to allow not total gambling,

405
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,000
 but a kind of form.

406
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,640
 It was a really popular game.

407
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,600
 And it is gambling.

408
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,440
 And really, everyone puts a bit of money in and the winner gets it all.

409
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,000
 So it's not like a mess.

410
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,720
 It's not quite, it's not like, I don't know, slot machines or whatever.

411
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,720
 Yeah.

412
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,720
 So does the House ever win?

413
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,960
 Does the game end when no one's playing?

414
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,960
 No.

415
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,480
 House never wins.

416
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,720
 But loads of the rhyming calls traditionally date back to the 19th century military.

417
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,800
 He said, cause it had been allowed in the army in the first place.

418
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,440
 So 51?

419
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,440
 Well, it's my gun.

420
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,120
 Oh, very nice.

421
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,160
 The Highland Division.

422
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:13,920
 Of course.

423
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,160
 So catchy, isn't it?

424
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,320
 And there's also, was she worth it?

425
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,480
 Seven and six?

426
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,960
 I don't know why that is seven and six.

427
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,200
 It was the price of a lady of the night, or?

428
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,440
 It was the price of a marriage, certificate.

429
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:32,320
 Oh, yeah, yeah, I mean, similar, similar vengeance, but it's like that.

430
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,760
 That says a lot about my relationship, isn't it?

431
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,240
 Ah, a sex worker, a wife.

432
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,480
 Oh, that's it, yeah, yeah.

433
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,560
 Well, the country, though, if they were to say price, if you were sent off again.

434
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,640
 Why did they put the marriage certificate off his neck to the brothel?

435
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:50,800
 Oh, how did you know that, Amy?

436
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,080
 Just straight out there.

437
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,080
 That was the price.

438
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,880
 Seven and six was the price of a marriage.

439
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,400
 Sometimes bingo knowledge is just in my bones.

440
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,400
 Yeah.

441
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,640
 I'm really impressed.

442
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,280
 All right, well, last one, Pompi Hort, 24.

443
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,280
 Oh, dear.

444
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,280
 Oh, that's...

445
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,280
 That's Portsmouth.

446
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,280
 Portsmouth sailors on leave.

447
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,280
 Oh, no.

448
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,280
 Sorry, that's where I met my wife.

449
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,280
 Yeah.

450
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,280
 Wife.

451
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,280
 Yeah.

452
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,720
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

453
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:28,240
 My point is that in 2010, it was reported that pizza or express was training its staff

454
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,400
 how to flirt subtly with customers so they felt more relaxed.

455
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,400
 Is it more relaxing?

456
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,160
 I wouldn't, it depends on the flirting, doesn't it?

457
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,160
 Yeah.

458
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,400
 But it's just someone being friendly and attentive, but is that flirting?

459
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,400
 No, really?

460
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,400
 No, really, no.

461
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,280
 This was reported, basically, as just a thing that pizza or express for trying.

462
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:49,600
 I think it was in their Richmond branch, and they'd hired an actor to train the staff

463
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,440
 to just, you know, be a bit extra friendly, I suppose.

464
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,800
 He said there's a difference between flirting with someone and coming onto them.

465
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,240
 We're not asking them to do that.

466
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,240
 That would be mad.

467
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,240
 Yeah.

468
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,000
 It would slow down service among other things, you know?

469
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,760
 But if you're a guy in a really gorgeous Italian girl comes to your table, it's great to

470
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,760
 meet somebody like that.

471
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,800
 And says, "Doble, sir?"

472
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,000
 No, it's just the way I'm sat.

473
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 Yeah, and it's even better to hear her talk with passion and authenticity about the

474
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,360
 ingredients on the menu.

475
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,840
 That's the flotation we're talking about.

476
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,120
 Again, I just think that falls under normal weight-resign.

477
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:30,240
 Also, I don't know if Mr James knew how many of the pizza or express staff are actually

478
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,240
 Italian, because it's certainly around my local, it's not required.

479
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,240
 No.

480
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,280
 Maybe, maybe people like flirting with you.

481
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,680
 Maybe that's just a natural thing, Andy.

482
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,680
 Oh, they're not flirting.

483
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,680
 No, no, no, no.

484
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,680
 Absolutely not.

485
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,440
 I don't know, so they didn't take it beyond this first and only pizza express.

486
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,800
 They reported that they were considering rolling it out, and there the trail goes cold.

487
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,800
 Right.

488
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,800
 Yeah.

489
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,120
 It would be very tricky for the staff to hear one day, like, "Oh, the job roll has changed

490
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,120
 ever so slightly.

491
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,360
 You're still serving the pizza, he's still taking the orders.

492
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,720
 You do need to sort of, really sexually excite the customers now."

493
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,720
 Excuse me?

494
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,720
 Yeah.

495
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,760
 It's like, you do the doubles, you know, you make sure they've had the starters, and then

496
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,840
 you just sort of look at the lips a lot, and you're like, "No, obviously you're not going

497
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,840
 to need the orders."

498
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:17,840
 If someone lots of my lips, when I was in pizza express, I would assume I had a knowledge

499
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,840
 on that.

500
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,840
 Yeah.

501
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,840
 Yeah.

502
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:25,840
 Flirting is actively not encouraged in quite a lot of industries.

503
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,920
 They actively say, "Don't flirt."

504
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,720
 I saw a headline talking about New York taxi drivers.

505
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,000
 This was genuinely the headline.

506
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,840
 I think it was in the independent.

507
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,480
 New York taxi drivers to be banned from flirting with, or ejaculating on passengers.

508
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,720
 I think flirting can go too far at times.

509
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,560
 I mean, he's facing the wrong way.

510
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,560
 Or she?

511
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,560
 But...

512
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:54,560
 You'll never guess who I ejaculate, you know, last week.

513
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:58,920
 Damn, what is this headline?

514
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:04,600
 It was just New York officials that said that they'd need to ban, because flirting would

515
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,280
 be happening, and people were complaining, and they had people writing in saying, "I'm

516
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:12,760
 sorry, I feel uncomfortable in the back of the cab when I'm being flirted with," and all

517
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,760
 ejaculated on.

518
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,760
 No, stop it, Jack.

519
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,760
 Wow.

520
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:21,960
 But for it to be banned, it must be happening at a frequency that's enough for it to need

521
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,960
 banning.

522
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,840
 I actually think they're already lashing it to ejaculate, sorry, Sam, that's banning already.

523
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:34,840
 That's the sauna in Leeds, where there's a sign in the sauna that says, "Do not piss."

524
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,840
 And it says, "Piss."

525
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,840
 It doesn't say, "You're in there."

526
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:41,160
 There's "Do not piss on the coals," and you're like, "Well, how often is it happening?"

527
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,040
 But they needed a sign.

528
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,080
 You'd be mad to put up, and no one has ever pissed on the coals.

529
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,080
 Absolutely.

530
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,040
 Because, in a way, I'd be like, "Well, I never thought of that."

531
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,240
 A lot of it steams more than what.

532
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:57,960
 So question, is it worse to piss on the coals, and put, "As in, is that going into your

533
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,960
 pores?"

534
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,960
 You know?

535
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,960
 I don't know.

536
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,960
 No, it'll be fine.

537
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,960
 It'll be fine.

538
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,960
 It'll be fine.

539
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,960
 Because it's water, it'll be fine.

540
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,960
 Are you the person that piss?

541
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,960
 I'm not defending it.

542
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,960
 I'm just saying.

543
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,960
 It also contains urea.

544
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,960
 Right.

545
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,960
 And that's not going to mean that there's going to be an ammonia in the air when you...

546
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,960
 There'll be an ammonia in the air, definitely.

547
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,960
 No one's denying that.

548
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,960
 Just saying is...

549
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,960
 There will be a tang in the air.

550
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,560
 Just don't know if breathing in vaporised pisses.

551
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,560
 I know it's not nice.

552
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,560
 I know it's not nice, but I just don't know if it's...

553
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,560
 It depends how much, doesn't it?

554
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,560
 Quantity is all.

555
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,560
 That's the problem.

556
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,560
 You're on there.

557
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,560
 It's like, "I just don't know if it's any worse, you're on there."

558
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,560
 I would just...

559
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,560
 Based on the calls, I don't think it affects anything.

560
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,560
 Did you see this firstly?

561
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,560
 Yeah, just this firstly.

562
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:44,560
 And then I was like, "Pull your pants back up, okay?"

563
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,560
 Whoops.

564
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,560
 Oh no.

565
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,560
 Oh no.

566
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,560
 Oh no.

567
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,560
 Oh no.

568
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,560
 Oh no.

569
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,560
 God.

570
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,560
 Yeah.

571
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,560
 Don't piss on my pants.

572
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,560
 It sounds like a saying.

573
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,560
 Like I wouldn't piss on his coal.

574
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,560
 You know?

575
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,560
 Yes.

576
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,560
 So flirting.

577
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,560
 Yeah.

578
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,560
 I mean, you make a show about...

579
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,560
 I love dating romance.

580
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,560
 Yes.

581
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,560
 Yeah.

582
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,560
 Call no than news, no.

583
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,560
 Call single ladies in your area.

584
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,560
 Single ladies.

585
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,560
 Okay.

586
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,560
 I just wanted to ask, if you have encountered this...

587
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,560
 Okay.

588
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,560
 Because you have been on dating absence.

589
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,560
 Oh, yeah.

590
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,560
 Big time.

591
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:22,560
 Have you encountered people flirting with you who you suspect of using artificial intelligence?

592
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,560
 Hmm.

593
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,560
 I've never considered that.

594
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:29,880
 Because this is the thing that's been coming up in the news more and more this year.

595
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,880
 People are basically coming up with responses to questions by putting it into chat GPT or whatever.

596
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,880
 And then saying...

597
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,880
 No, no, no, no.

598
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,880
 And then people are going on dates with them and finding you're not interesting or funny at all.

599
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,880
 Wow.

600
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,880
 Because everything they've done has basically been mediated through.

601
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,880
 And sometimes you'll get two people using chat GPT talking to each other.

602
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,880
 And there's basically two robots talking to each other using the medium of humans.

603
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,880
 Wow.

604
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,880
 It's...

605
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,880
 I know.

606
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,880
 But you haven't found that.

607
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:01,880
 And I don't... I don't think so. And if they are using chat GPT and that's been punched up,

608
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,880
 I would hate to see what they started with.

609
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:10,880
 Because if they need chat GPT to get to what you've been up to this weekend question mark kiss,

610
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,880
 then what AI is not taking over.

611
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,880
 The person who...

612
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:24,880
 One of founders of Bumble who's Whitney Wolf heard reckons that soon we'll be able to have sort of AI versions of ourselves

613
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:31,880
 that have basically all of my lines or things that I would be likely to say will be in this AI version.

614
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:36,880
 And then you might have your AI version and our two AI's can meet and see if they get on.

615
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,880
 And if our little robot speed can get on, then we will get on in real life.

616
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,880
 Yeah, I mean, it kind of makes sense.

617
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,880
 It makes sense.

618
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,880
 Yeah.

619
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,880
 Is that a world you want to live in?

620
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,880
 It's true.

621
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,880
 It's odd.

622
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,880
 I'm out of that world now.

623
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,880
 Have there a opinion on it, really?

624
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:56,880
 I suppose the experience of being on the apps is so boring and annoying and lots of people chat to you for a bit,

625
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,880
 then they just disappear without anything.

626
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,880
 I can imagine any shortcut to not doing that anymore would be a good thing.

627
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,880
 Yeah.

628
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,880
 Well, I tried it.

629
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:10,880
 I tried chat GPT-generated flirting on my wife.

630
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,880
 Oh, okay.

631
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:15,880
 But I just asked chat GPT, can you come up with something flirtatious for me to say to my wife?

632
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:20,880
 Yeah, line one, your laugh is my favourite song and your arms are my favourite place to be.

633
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,880
 Oh, yeah.

634
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,880
 She said, okay.

635
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:30,880
 And then I thought, this is going well.

636
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,880
 I'll follow it up.

637
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,880
 You still give me butterflies.

638
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,880
 I must have done something amazing to deserve you as you said, what's going on?

639
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,880
 It's just like what?

640
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,880
 Very much.

641
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,880
 Have you crashed the car?

642
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,880
 Yeah.

643
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,880
 And then I said, I would love to answer this, but you have no more free chats left.

644
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,880
 Please upgrade the pro to continue.

645
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,880
 That sealed the deal.

646
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,880
 She said, you got me.

647
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,880
 Yeah.

648
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,880
 Upstairs now.

649
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,880
 Wow, we, that's amazing.

650
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,880
 No, Grim.

651
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:06,880
 Can I tell you some historical flirting techniques from Lanccia where I'm from?

652
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,880
 Oh, okay.

653
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:12,880
 There was a thing called promenading or promenading where a load of boys and girls

654
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,880
 stand on opposite sides of a road to each other.

655
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,880
 And they wouldn't say anything.

656
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:20,880
 They'd just try and make eye contact with each other and sort of like smile and stuff like that.

657
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,880
 And then everyone would go home.

658
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,880
 And if the girl fancyed the boy, she would leave a cake outside his house.

659
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,880
 And then that would mean they were dating.

660
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,880
 So you would know.

661
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,880
 Wow.

662
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,880
 Feels like I could create confusion.

663
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,880
 What if you were able to eye contact with two people and you have found one cake outside your house?

664
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,880
 Yeah.

665
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,880
 Maybe the cake has the name on it.

666
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,880
 That's a good idea.

667
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,880
 Or is it still my day, Dan?

668
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,880
 Still my day.

669
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,880
 Still my day.

670
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,880
 Got the seven and six ready.

671
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:52,880
 And this is early 20th century.

672
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,880
 So a little bit before my day.

673
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,880
 Just on the cast.

674
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,880
 And then there's a guy called Spanking Roger, who's one of my favourite people in history.

675
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,880
 Oh, yeah.

676
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:08,880
 And he got together with his partner through a thing that used to happen on the malls just outside Manchester.

677
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,880
 And they would have a naked race of all the young lads in the town.

678
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:18,880
 And then the girls would sort of stand there watching and sort of eye up the form of everyone there.

679
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,880
 And then a bit later they'd all go down the pub and they'd go, yeah, like the look at you.

680
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,880
 Oh, my god.

681
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,880
 He was called Spanking's Banking Roger.

682
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,880
 Yeah, because he was also a boxer.

683
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,880
 No, no.

684
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,880
 I was like, something.

685
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,880
 Something heard the question.

686
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,880
 No, he would beat people up, like beat people in the ring.

687
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,880
 And he'd give you a shot.

688
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,880
 He'd give you a, he'd give you a spanking.

689
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,880
 Yeah, right, right.

690
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,880
 Wow.

691
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,880
 Like a live naked attraction.

692
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,880
 Yeah.

693
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,880
 But moving, like moving, yeah.

694
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,880
 Those are naked attractions.

695
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,880
 You don't know how well they can move.

696
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,880
 They're just standing there, aren't they?

697
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,880
 It's a good point actually.

698
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,880
 That's a really good point.

699
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,880
 Tell me, Amy, why do humans fly?

700
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,880
 Why do humans fly?

701
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:02,880
 Like, why do we not just come up to each other and say, I want to have sex with you and then have children that way?

702
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,880
 Oh, I don't know.

703
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,880
 It's much easier if we're allowed to do that with Nick.

704
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,880
 God.

705
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,880
 I honestly think that would be fantastic.

706
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,880
 If, but you could all just be honest and be like, you're physically attractive.

707
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,880
 And I think we should put our meat sacks together.

708
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,880
 Like, I think that would just be so much easier.

709
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,880
 But I don't know.

710
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,880
 So there's a New York taxi driver listening to this right now.

711
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,880
 On breach.

712
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:30,880
 I guess there must be some sort of evolutionary thing.

713
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,880
 Is it to see if you're like a good match?

714
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,880
 Kind of, yes.

715
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:38,880
 So the problem is that humans used to spend a lot of time in very small groups.

716
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,880
 And if you decide that you want to get together with someone and they were buff you,

717
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,880
 you can't just move to London.

718
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,880
 And then sort of move to a new place and get a new life or anything.

719
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,880
 You're stuck in that place.

720
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:57,880
 So the only way to do it is to give very sort of small signals that you can deny if someone says.

721
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,880
 So it's deny ability, basically.

722
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,880
 That's clever.

723
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,880
 Because there is this thing of lots of people don't know when they're being flirted with.

724
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,880
 Yeah.

725
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,880
 And I'm afraid Amy, women are especially bad at it.

726
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,880
 It's just your personal opinion.

727
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,880
 You're like, I fly all the time.

728
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,880
 You don't want to give me anything bad.

729
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,880
 Genetically, they're just not good at it.

730
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,880
 Actually, it's women and men.

731
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:28,880
 So women sort of sometimes under perceive when they're being flirted with and men over perceive it.

732
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:37,880
 So it will often be like male students when asked that they're like clear than women to misinterpret friendly gestures as sexual interest.

733
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,880
 And many mistake, but many people do mistake sexual cues as amicable signals.

734
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:46,880
 But often, if you're a straight man, the nervous woman smiling at you is not flirting with you.

735
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,880
 She's nervous and you're thinking, she's flirting with me and women underestimate her.

736
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,880
 And there is a theory that this leads to the idea of the friend zone, which is not a real,

737
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,880
 or it's the idea that the friend zone is not a real thing.

738
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,880
 It's that people are just drastically misinterpreting each other's cues.

739
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,880
 And men are saying, I've been friend zoned.

740
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,880
 And actually, that's not what has happened.

741
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,880
 It's just that she's just not that into you to go on a phrase.

742
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,880
 And so, yeah, yeah, it's tricky.

743
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:16,880
 And I think a lot of women, I think you are really having to be friendly if you're like feeling unsafe.

744
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,880
 So you're like, if you're like on a train and a scary man's, it's next to you.

745
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,880
 And he might think he's flirting and you kind of can't say, please don't talk to me.

746
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,880
 I hate this.

747
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,880
 So you have to go like, oh, really?

748
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,880
 Oh, that's nice.

749
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,880
 He'll be like, she's into it.

750
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,880
 But you're thinking, don't harm me, don't kill me, don't fight.

751
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,880
 I don't where I live.

752
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:43,880
 But you're, I guess you're giving off kind of friendly-ish signals as a kind of safety device.

753
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,880
 And I guess guys will be like, she loves this.

754
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:53,880
 There is only one way around this. And that is boys on one side of the road, girls on the other side of the road.

755
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,880
 Yeah, there's subtle links.

756
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,880
 I think any flirting with cakes is fantastic.

757
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,880
 Can I tell you something very quickly that I found that that links in?

758
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,880
 I guess sexy stuff and pizza and poems.

759
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,880
 Oh, yeah.

760
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,880
 Oh, wow.

761
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,880
 Okay. So there was an article that said that pizza hot response a furious whole customer

762
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,880
 who claims ketchup bottle label sounds like swingers app.

763
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:20,880
 So I was like, well, what the hell are they calling their ketchup and pizza hot?

764
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,880
 Do you want to guess what they name it?

765
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,880
 Squirties.

766
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,880
 Yeah.

767
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,880
 So they call it shake, squeeze and squirt.

768
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,880
 And he was like, that is too sexual.

769
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,880
 I think it's it.

770
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,880
 It says quite directions.

771
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,880
 I think it's on a ketchup bottle.

772
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,880
 I think it's not too sexual.

773
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,880
 Yeah.

774
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,880
 Context is all.

775
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,880
 Yeah.

776
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,880
 Yeah.

777
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,880
 It's a penis tattoo.

778
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,880
 If you just tap it on the top, it'll come up.

779
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,880
 Yeah.

780
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,880
 Turn it upside down and bang the bottom really hard.

781
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,880
 It doesn't work.

782
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,880
 Stick enough today.

783
00:28:53,880 --> 00:29:02,880
 Okay.

784
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,880
 It is time for fact number three.

785
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,880
 And that is my fact.

786
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:11,880
 My fact this week is that in 1931, Laurel and Hardy simultaneously filmed up to five

787
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:16,880
 versions of every movie that they made, each time, speaking in a different language,

788
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,880
 despite the fact that they only knew English.

789
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,880
 Lovely.

790
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,880
 But this is this is a fascinating bit of Hollywood, which often doesn't get mentioned,

791
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:30,880
 which is when it was the silent era, when you were sending movies over to Europe or any other country,

792
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,880
 it was very easy.

793
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,880
 You replaced the card with the words on it, right?

794
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:37,880
 And so people had these massive fan bases all over the world.

795
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,880
 Laurel and Hardy in particular had a big, big fan base in Spain and Italy.

796
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,880
 And Italy and other countries in Europe.

797
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,880
 And then when it became the talky movies, suddenly they were not understanding it.

798
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,880
 And they didn't have the technology to do subtitles at the time.

799
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,880
 So what used to happen was, and this was an idea of Hal Roach, who was this amazing movie mogul,

800
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:00,880
 he said, we're going to film every single scene of everything you film from now,

801
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,880
 up to five different languages.

802
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,880
 And they had to learn phonetically how to say all of the dialogue.

803
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,880
 There was half an hour of rehearsals for each scene where they had to learn the phrases.

804
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,880
 They had speech coaches of the language there with them telling them to do it.

805
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,880
 You know what I thought when I read this is there's no way they did it very well.

806
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,880
 Because as someone who's learning a language right now,

807
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:25,880
 you can know exactly how to say something, but you try and say it.

808
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,880
 And so a native speaker, it doesn't quite sound right?

809
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,880
 Yeah, so that's definitely true.

810
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,880
 And I think the interesting thing that was, I read a report about it,

811
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:40,880
 which said, Spanish audiences took special satisfaction in seeing Laurel Orhardy squirming under the burden of a difficult castellium phrase.

812
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,880
 And so it's sort of almost funnier, seeing knowing that they're having to do it,

813
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,880
 and knowing they can't do it very well.

814
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,880
 Everyone else was a perfect speaker.

815
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,880
 So they surrounded them in the different way.

816
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,880
 So all the other actors were perfect.

817
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,880
 I presume, or maybe they subbed in the actors and like said, right, get the Spanish cast in now.

818
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,880
 They'll do it with them. So yeah, that might have been it.

819
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,880
 A lot of these movies are now lost because they weren't the main thing that people were keeping for posterity, right?

820
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,880
 Like the English-speaking versions were.

821
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,880
 But it's exactly that. They loved it.

822
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:11,880
 Laurel Orhardy could just mumble a sentence, you know, that doesn't matter. It's comedy.

823
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,880
 It's fine.

824
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,880
 Yeah.

825
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,880
 We just want to see them falling over with the piano.

826
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,880
 Yeah.

827
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,880
 I bet they knew how to say, oh no, piano in so many different languages.

828
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,880
 Yeah, the thing about piano is it's the same in almost every language.

829
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,880
 Yeah, perfect.

830
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:31,880
 But yeah, I was thinking about double acts because Amy, you're part of a double act to work.

831
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,880
 Still am.

832
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,880
 Still am.

833
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,880
 The delightful sausage.

834
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,880
 Yeah.

835
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,880
 Yeah.

836
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,880
 It's catchy name.

837
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,880
 We never thought we would be a double act.

838
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,880
 We just needed to run a comedy night together.

839
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,880
 And we said, what should we call it?

840
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,880
 And Chris had literally just had breakfast and he said, that was a delightful sausage.

841
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,880
 And we were like, yeah, yeah, that'll do that.

842
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,880
 Ten years later, we're like, we should have thought about that name just like a bit more.

843
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,880
 It's a great name.

844
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,880
 It's a great name.

845
00:31:53,880 --> 00:32:00,880
 I mean, the word sausage is the funniest word in the world, which we recently learned as part of no such thing as a fish that the word

846
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:07,880
 sausage has been in our titles more than any other word out there outside of like with and or so on.

847
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,880
 So number one word.

848
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,880
 So you're onto something.

849
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,880
 Wow.

850
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,880
 Because you could have gone something and something.

851
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,880
 Yeah.

852
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,880
 Something, yeah.

853
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,880
 Like Laurel and Harvey is the classic one, you know, Cannibal, Helen pace, all of that.

854
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,880
 All those things like the mighty bush, where it's not clear that it's a double act.

855
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,880
 Yes.

856
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:25,880
 I reckon the mighty bush is similar to your name because that's named after his hair, wasn't it?

857
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,880
 Like, you know, you're feeling so active.

858
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,880
 You got a mighty bush.

859
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,880
 Yeah.

860
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,880
 Oh my god.

861
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,880
 So it's one of you got it.

862
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,880
 He's floating.

863
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,880
 He's floating.

864
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,880
 I feel safe.

865
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:44,880
 But yeah, Chris does have a huge bush.

866
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,880
 Hey, there's another technique by the way that I've seen a double act using comedy where they don't speak the language.

867
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:56,880
 Rick Maill and Adrian Edmondson, they often used to speak backwards in their scenes.

868
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:06,880
 So guesthouse parodies so their movie, they would speak backwards a line because the comedy stunt that they were doing was so dangerous that it only worked if you played it in reverse.

869
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:13,880
 So rather than throwing spiky nails into the nose of Rick Maill, you would take them out with him, go.

870
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:17,880
 And then you would get the line played forward and the scene played forward.

871
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,880
 For me, do you know what the word sausage is backwards?

872
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,880
 Jesus.

873
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,880
 Jesus.

874
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,880
 sausage.

875
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,880
 Oh my god.

876
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,880
 Well, son of, yeah.

877
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,880
 Oh my god.

878
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,880
 Wow.

879
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,880
 Damn it.

880
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,880
 I think guesthouse parodies are about five times.

881
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,880
 I didn't know that.

882
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,880
 I didn't know that.

883
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,880
 It's in the bonus VHS.

884
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,880
 There we go.

885
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:40,880
 Documentary.

886
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,880
 No one watches the bonuses like you don't.

887
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,880
 It's such a good film.

888
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,880
 It's great.

889
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,880
 Laurel and Hardy.

890
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,880
 Have you seen any of the stuff I mean?

891
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:57,880
 Yeah, I have seen stuff, but I wouldn't say, you know, is it ridiculous to explain who they are to an audience?

892
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,880
 I think so.

893
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,880
 Young people.

894
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,880
 Yeah.

895
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,880
 Comedy double act.

896
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:10,880
 Stan Oro was tall and thin and legubris looking and Oli Hardy was, and British and Oli Hardy was sort of a big, big fellow with the moustache and

897
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:16,880
 Laurel was always doing silly things and Oli Hardy was always annoyed with him and they were mega-famous.

898
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,880
 They were sort of globally famous.

899
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:23,880
 If you name any other, like Silent Moves, like Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, they're in absolutely that sort of echelon.

900
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,880
 And I'd started looking into their lives.

901
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:31,880
 So Oliver Hardy had a very interesting early life.

902
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,880
 So his real name was Norvell.

903
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:38,880
 But his father, Oliver Hardy's dad, fought in the American Civil War.

904
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,880
 Yeah, really?

905
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,880
 What is the timeline of that?

906
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,880
 Isn't that nuts?

907
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,880
 Was it like a hilarious sort of battle that he was in?

908
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,880
 [laughter]

909
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,880
 20,000 people were killed in that custard pie fight.

910
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,880
 Yeah.

911
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,880
 Yeah, no, his father was a sergeant in the Confederate army.

912
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,880
 That's the 1860s.

913
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,880
 And then Oliver Hardy was born in 1892.

914
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,880
 So it all worked.

915
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,880
 He fought in the Civil War as a very young man, and then 30 years later he had Oliver.

916
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,880
 But like, yeah, it's extraordinary. All his grandfather was a slave owner.

917
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,880
 Right.

918
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,880
 Oh my God.

919
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,880
 The generations you have to go to get back to that period.

920
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,880
 It's so few.

921
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,880
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

922
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,880
 Yeah.

923
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:23,880
 He's famous, while we're just mentioning their sort of classic traits, for looking at the camera with a really frustrated face.

924
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,880
 Like the Miranda.

925
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,880
 Like the Miranda looking exactly like that.

926
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:35,880
 Yeah, yeah. And there's a story that goes that in order to get the best performance out of him,

927
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,880
 Stan Laurel, who was really kind of the mastermind behind the two of them.

928
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,880
 He was the real thinker, the new comedy inside out.

929
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,880
 He was a James Harkin of that group.

930
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,880
 Yeah, exactly.

931
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,880
 He was a bossy.

932
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,880
 Yeah, bossy.

933
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,880
 [laughter]

934
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,880
 The kind of guys are pissed on some calls.

935
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,880
 [laughter]

936
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,880
 So he used to get Hardy to do those frustrated looks into the camera at the end of the day,

937
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,880
 because he knew that at the end of the day, Hardy wanted to get out of there and get on the golf course.

938
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,880
 He was like, "I want to play golf," and he would keep him a bit.

939
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,880
 He was a James Harkin.

940
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,880
 [laughter]

941
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,880
 Exactly.

942
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:13,880
 And so those frustrated looks were growingly real, because he was like, "I'm meant to be out of here."

943
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:18,880
 I found some nice things about Stan that I really liked.

944
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:23,880
 Did you know that he, so he was doing hydroponic gardening that was one of his looks?

945
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,880
 Oh, really?

946
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,880
 And he once crossbred a potato and an onion, but couldn't get anyone to sample the results.

947
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,880
 [laughter]

948
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,880
 That was tragic.

949
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,880
 With his after, he was famous.

950
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,880
 Yeah.

951
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,880
 Wow.

952
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,880
 Yeah.

953
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,880
 I think it sounds a bit weird.

954
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,880
 Like, if you're making a hot pot, you only have to put one thing in.

955
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,880
 Yes.

956
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,880
 [laughter]

957
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,880
 Also, at times, Ava.

958
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,880
 He was from the Lake District.

959
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,880
 Yeah.

960
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,880
 Didn't know that from all sorts of things.

961
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,880
 Oh, I read Overston.

962
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,880
 Oh.

963
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,880
 Is that so?

964
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,880
 Yeah.

965
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,880
 Very close by.

966
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,880
 They both begin with you.

967
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:56,880
 Well, it's now home to what's described as the world's only Laurel and Hardy Museum.

968
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,880
 It's really weird.

969
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,880
 There's only one?

970
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,880
 That is weird.

971
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,880
 It's not weird.

972
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,880
 Why is that not weird?

973
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,880
 It's completely normal there's only one museum dedicated entirely to Laurel and Hardy.

974
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,880
 Okay, maybe there should be two.

975
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,880
 Two tops.

976
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,880
 Two tops.

977
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,880
 Yeah.

978
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:13,880
 I opened up a Laurel and Hardy cafe and ice cream bar in Kosovo back in 2003.

979
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,880
 What?

980
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,880
 What?

981
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,880
 So, I was going to say when we were describing here.

982
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:22,880
 So, I think I'm going to say, "Lie, what are you going to say, honey?"

983
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,880
 I'm going with true.

984
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,880
 I think it's true.

985
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,880
 I think it's true.

986
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,880
 I think it's like a double bluff.

987
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,880
 I think it's true.

988
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,880
 What the hell?

989
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:33,880
 Well, I was saying, and it wasn't my own money that was evolved, but I was living in Kosovo

990
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,880
 when I was 18.

991
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,880
 Who wouldn't back that with being happy at all?

992
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,880
 The dragons are all there.

993
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,880
 They're fighting to get you.

994
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,880
 Are we doing this Kosovo?

995
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,880
 Kosovo.

996
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:51,880
 Don't I mean, it ends out with a chair shaking your hand.

997
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,880
 Yes, I'll take it.

998
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,880
 Yes.

999
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,880
 I'm in.

1000
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,880
 I'm all in.

1001
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:00,880
 There was a guy out there who I became friends with through my grandmother.

1002
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,880
 And he was like, "You like covenirs?"

1003
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,880
 I was like, "Yeah."

1004
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,880
 And he was like, "I'm opening a cafe and I want it to be themed."

1005
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,880
 And we spoke about it and we landed on the restaurant, would be the Hardy restaurant.

1006
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,880
 And you would have the ice cream bar, which was Stan.

1007
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,880
 And so it was all, you know, the images of them were up on the walls.

1008
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,880
 And you could buy statues.

1009
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,880
 But they were massive in Kosovo.

1010
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,880
 Ice statues, of course.

1011
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,880
 Yeah.

1012
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,880
 I'm not hungry.

1013
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,880
 I have a big lunch.

1014
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:31,880
 I'll just have a statue of Oliver Hardy, please.

1015
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,880
 Nine in the shot.

1016
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,880
 You didn't buy statues of the shot.

1017
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,880
 Would I be?

1018
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,880
 That'd be crazy.

1019
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,880
 Yeah.

1020
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,880
 We're just outside W going.

1021
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,880
 The next shot.

1022
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,880
 The next shot.

1023
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,880
 The next shot.

1024
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,880
 The wisdom was big in Albania.

1025
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,880
 I think you guys might know that they loved him there.

1026
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,880
 Oliver Hardy and Stan Laurel huge in that bit of the world as well.

1027
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,880
 Is it still trading?

1028
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,880
 I don't know.

1029
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,880
 I haven't been back for some.

1030
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,880
 I imagine it.

1031
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,880
 Can't come out of business.

1032
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,880
 There's our franchises in every city in the Balkans.

1033
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:08,880
 Okay.

1034
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,880
 It's time for our final fact of the show.

1035
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,880
 And that is James.

1036
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,880
 Okay.

1037
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:17,880
 My fact this week is that the character of Aunt Bessie was invented in 1994 to stop people mistaking

1038
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,880
 Yorkshire puddings for nuclear weapons.

1039
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,880
 Quick question.

1040
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,880
 Yeah.

1041
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,880
 Who's Aunt Bessie?

1042
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,880
 I can't believe that you don't know who Aunt Bessie is.

1043
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,880
 Educate the boy.

1044
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,880
 Aunt Bessie is a maternal figure who makes Yorkshire puddings.

1045
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,880
 She's like the patron saint of Hol.

1046
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,880
 Yeah.

1047
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,880
 Okay.

1048
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,880
 Yeah.

1049
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,880
 I can't believe she's not widely known.

1050
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,880
 Never heard of her.

1051
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,880
 But she's not real, right?

1052
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,880
 She's not real.

1053
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,880
 No, she was invented in 1994 to stop people mistaking Yorkshire puddings for nuclear weapons.

1054
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,880
 Right.

1055
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,880
 So up until that point, when you go to Sunday lunch and go, "Whoa, everyone out, everyone out!"

1056
00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:00,880
 Well, it's worse because when they were trying the nuclear tests off, they just threw a big

1057
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,880
 Yorkshire puddings into it.

1058
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:06,880
 Like a lot of Hawaiian islands were destroyed by massive Yorkshire puddings being dropped

1059
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,880
 over.

1060
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:12,880
 So, basically, this company that makes Yorkshire puddings was originally called Triton.

1061
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:17,880
 They're based in Hol and they did market research and found that people associated the name Triton

1062
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,880
 with the UK's nuclear deterrent, which is Triton.

1063
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,880
 Yeah.

1064
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,880
 And only 4% of people associated the word with Yorkshire puddings.

1065
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,880
 So they decided to come up with a new brand and that new brand was Aunt Bessie.

1066
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,880
 Yeah.

1067
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,880
 And they are the biggest makers of Yorkshire pudding, probably in the world, but definitely in Britain.

1068
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,880
 Yeah.

1069
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:36,880
 And they make millions of them.

1070
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,880
 They can't be anywhere outside Britain that makes more Yorkshire puddings than Britain.

1071
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,880
 Yeah.

1072
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,880
 You know, sometimes you just find out, "Oh, it happens that they're massive."

1073
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,880
 Yeah.

1074
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,880
 It's like Kosovo.

1075
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,880
 There's this huge factory.

1076
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,880
 It's themed around Harold Lloyd.

1077
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,880
 And it's...

1078
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,880
 Yeah.

1079
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:55,880
 Instead of custard pies, we use Yorkshire puddings in the restaurant.

1080
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,880
 Yeah.

1081
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,880
 Should we say what are Yorkshire puddings for international listeners?

1082
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,880
 Okay.

1083
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,880
 For those of you not in Yorkshire or Bolivia, it is...

1084
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,880
 It's batter, so that's flour and water and eggs.

1085
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:15,880
 And you get some hot oil and you make it really, really hot and then you put the batter into it

1086
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:20,880
 and it puffs up into a delicious crispy thing that you eat with meat and gravy.

1087
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,880
 You can have them as desserts as well, you know.

1088
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,880
 Oh, yeah.

1089
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,880
 Yeah, you can put ice cream in.

1090
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,880
 Have you done that?

1091
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,880
 Yeah, it's really cool.

1092
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,880
 It's actually the best day ever.

1093
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:34,880
 We had, we went for a roast dinner in London, actually, it wasn't even in the north.

1094
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:39,880
 We had a Sunday lunch with huge Yorkshire puddings and then on the menu,

1095
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:43,880
 you can get Yorkshire puddings with three scoops of ice cream in.

1096
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,880
 It was fantastic.

1097
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,880
 It was fantastic.

1098
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,880
 It's like a waffle.

1099
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,880
 It's like a pancake, isn't it, really?

1100
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,880
 It feels decadent that sort of, you know.

1101
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,880
 Because is that still made with beef dripping?

1102
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,880
 Are you adding ice cream to beef dripping?

1103
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,880
 I presume so, yes.

1104
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:01,880
 I've got to say that is a step two northern for me.

1105
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:05,880
 Have you been to the factory that makes them?

1106
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,880
 I've driven past it a million times.

1107
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,880
 I've never been there.

1108
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,880
 Oh, interesting.

1109
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,880
 This is an interesting question for you.

1110
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:15,880
 People who work there, some of them have reported that as they drive past,

1111
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:20,880
 even if they work in a different industry, they feel the call of the factory to work there.

1112
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,880
 Wow.

1113
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,880
 What are you talking about?

1114
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,880
 So the factories Yorkshire pudding guru, as he's known, David Barr,

1115
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,880
 that's how he ended up working there.

1116
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,880
 He used to work in fish.

1117
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,880
 He was always in the fish industry and he used to pass it every day and he thought,

1118
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,880
 "Oh, I feel I need to be in there."

1119
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,880
 And he applied three times for the job.

1120
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,880
 What's that movie where they sort of make the spaceship out of mashed potatoes?

1121
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,880
 Close and close to the...

1122
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:46,880
 This is like the Yorkshire version of that.

1123
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,880
 Yeah, exactly.

1124
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,880
 Yeah.

1125
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,880
 No, he felt the calling and he went for three interviews and he failed the first two.

1126
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:56,880
 And he said, finally, he got the job when they just asked him why he wanted to join the company

1127
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,880
 and he went, "I just love Yorkshire puddings."

1128
00:42:58,880 --> 00:42:59,880
 And they're like, "You're in."

1129
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,880
 And he's now literally the top of the heap.

1130
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,880
 He is the man.

1131
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,880
 He's the guru.

1132
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:04,880
 He's his title there.

1133
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,880
 Is that Willy Wonka of Yorkshire pudding?

1134
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:07,880
 Yeah, exactly.

1135
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,880
 That's a good film.

1136
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,880
 I mean, it's pretty crazy, isn't it?

1137
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,880
 Like, the amount that they produce.

1138
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:17,880
 Every day, they use more than half a million eggs in order to make...

1139
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:22,880
 This is in the Christmas season where it really ramps up and they have to bring in more staff

1140
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:23,880
 of all felt the calling.

1141
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,880
 It's a pretty incredible process.

1142
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:26,880
 It's like a wonderland.

1143
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,880
 And what do you think do you toss?

1144
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,880
 Like, visitors can go because I would genuinely be interested in going.

1145
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,880
 I'm sure your career has allowed you now.

1146
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:35,880
 Do you think?

1147
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,880
 Do you think I've got the key to the factory?

1148
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:38,880
 You've got the poll.

1149
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,880
 What's the point of getting all these awards?

1150
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,880
 And all these amazing podcasts, if you can't then get into the Yorkshire pudding party.

1151
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,880
 You've got a whole second greatest comedy double act.

1152
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,880
 Of course you're getting it.

1153
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:54,880
 I'm sorry, Hailey and Pace are geniuses.

1154
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:55,880
 And they from Hull.

1155
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,880
 Gareth Hailey is from Hull, yeah.

1156
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:58,880
 Yeah, yeah.

1157
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,880
 Born and raised.

1158
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:00,880
 What if he's been to the factory?

1159
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:01,880
 Of course he has.

1160
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:02,880
 He's got a key.

1161
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:03,880
 He's got a key.

1162
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:04,880
 He's got a key.

1163
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:05,880
 He's got a key.

1164
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:06,880
 He's probably shagged out.

1165
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:07,880
 Bessie, he's...

1166
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:08,880
 Wow.

1167
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,880
 Can I ask you something about Hull?

1168
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,880
 Yes, please.

1169
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:16,880
 Hull got listed as part of Lonely Planets 500 travel experiences in the UK.

1170
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,880
 Unmissable experiences and hidden plans.

1171
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,880
 You made one entry in the 500.

1172
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,880
 You were listed 483.

1173
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,880
 And it was a public toilet.

1174
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:27,880
 No.

1175
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:28,880
 Yeah.

1176
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:29,880
 What's the experience to have?

1177
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:30,880
 It's secret.

1178
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:35,880
 It was Victoria Peer's public toilet.

1179
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:36,880
 Have you been?

1180
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:37,880
 Yeah.

1181
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:38,880
 Is it good?

1182
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:39,880
 No.

1183
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:40,880
 But is it historical?

1184
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,880
 Yeah, it's kind of beautiful, but the outside.

1185
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:46,880
 But if you actually use the toilet itself, you're harrowing.

1186
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,880
 You're not going to be pissing in the sauna.

1187
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:49,880
 I don't think it is.

1188
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:53,880
 If you had a genuinely fair choice, would 100% go for the sauna?

1189
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,880
 At least then you're in a sauna.

1190
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:56,880
 Yeah.

1191
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,880
 It's actually a good way of getting rid of human excruence, isn't it, in a way?

1192
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:01,880
 A sauna.

1193
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:04,880
 Yeah, like it means you don't have to have drains or anything,

1194
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,880
 because it just evaporates.

1195
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:07,880
 You breathe it all in.

1196
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:08,880
 You breathe in that piss.

1197
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:09,880
 That's what I'm saying.

1198
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:10,880
 But it's number one, sadly.

1199
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:11,880
 Yeah.

1200
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:12,880
 It's number one, sadly.

1201
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:17,880
 We're going to have to update that sign.

1202
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,880
 That sign.

1203
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:24,880
 Imagine the disdain of the person writing, "Oh, shit."

1204
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,880
 Don't baby right, or ejaculate.

1205
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:28,880
 You taxi drivers.

1206
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:29,880
 We're one of you taxi drivers.

1207
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:30,880
 We're one of you taxi drivers.

1208
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,880
 We're one of you taxi drivers.

1209
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:32,880
 We're one of you taxi drivers.

1210
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:33,880
 We're one of you taxi drivers.

1211
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:34,880
 We're one of you taxi drivers.

1212
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:35,880
 We're one of you taxi drivers.

1213
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:36,880
 Oh my god.

1214
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,880
 Oh my god.

1215
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:39,880
 Hold patty.

1216
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:40,880
 Patty butty.

1217
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:41,880
 Yeah.

1218
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:42,880
 You've got a red one.

1219
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:43,880
 No, I never have.

1220
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:44,880
 What's a patty butty?

1221
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:45,880
 What?

1222
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,880
 You don't know what a patty butty is.

1223
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:48,880
 I like the shirt.

1224
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,880
 I like how that hollets the wrong end of the M62.

1225
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:54,880
 If you end up there, you've gone seriously wrong.

1226
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,880
 Yeah, you've really gone wrong there.

1227
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,880
 So a patty is a potato.

1228
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:05,880
 It's like mashed potato with lovely herbs in deep fries.

1229
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,880
 Deep fried to make it sort of like a...

1230
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,880
 It's almost like a potato fritter.

1231
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:10,880
 Yeah.

1232
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,880
 But then you have it in a breadcake or a bread bun or however you want to say that.

1233
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,880
 And you pack vinegar onto it till it's dripping.

1234
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:18,880
 And it's fantastic.

1235
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:19,880
 That sounds good.

1236
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:20,880
 That sounds good.

1237
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:21,880
 Oh, it's so good.

1238
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:22,880
 It's a really traditional hull dish.

1239
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:23,880
 Yeah.

1240
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,880
 It's traditionally made by the maidens of hull.

1241
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:26,880
 By hand.

1242
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,880
 Did they roll it on their thighs like the Cubans are girls.

1243
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:31,880
 Yeah.

1244
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:35,880
 Just wipe the oil off on your thighs.

1245
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:36,880
 Oh my God.

1246
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,880
 It's very hard to tell sometimes if you're in hull or hervana.

1247
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:42,880
 But if you smell the vinegar, that's what you know.

1248
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,880
 You know your flirting's gone well where you can smell the vinegar.

1249
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:48,880
 I'm not a hull maiden.

1250
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:53,880
 But there was this whole group of women and they were called patty slappers.

1251
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:54,880
 No.

1252
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:55,880
 Wow.

1253
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:56,880
 That was a drop.

1254
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,880
 I just wondered, is that known in hull?

1255
00:46:58,880 --> 00:46:59,880
 I didn't know that.

1256
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:02,880
 I just got a new idea for a show.

1257
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,880
 Wow.

1258
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,880
 That's incredible.

1259
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,880
 You've got the lemsip factory.

1260
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:10,880
 We've got the lemsip factory.

1261
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:11,880
 Really.

1262
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:12,880
 Isn't that cool?

1263
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:13,880
 I don't know.

1264
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:14,880
 I owe a great deal.

1265
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:15,880
 I owe a great deal.

1266
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:16,880
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1267
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:17,880
 Racket.

1268
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:18,880
 Is the firm on it?

1269
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:19,880
 Yeah.

1270
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:20,880
 That's very cool.

1271
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,880
 Actually, there's quite a fun thing which was this team called the drunk animal creative studio.

1272
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:28,880
 Set up these things of alternative blue plaques to commemorate the locals had done interesting things.

1273
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:29,880
 Have you seen those?

1274
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,880
 I think I've, yeah, I think I've heard of it.

1275
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:33,880
 But I don't know.

1276
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:34,880
 I don't know if I've seen any.

1277
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:41,880
 So like an example would be on this spot last Monday, Tom Piper got lucky.

1278
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:42,880
 That was one.

1279
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:43,880
 Yeah.

1280
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:44,880
 Here was one.

1281
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:50,880
 Ronnie Pickering, 2015, became an internet sensation near here for his red citron Picasso.

1282
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:51,880
 The citron hull, really Pickering.

1283
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:52,880
 Yeah, he's from home.

1284
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:53,880
 Yeah.

1285
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:54,880
 That's amazing.

1286
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:55,880
 That's a bit.

1287
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:56,880
 You know Ronnie Pickering, but you don't know.

1288
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,960
 - This is wild. (laughing)

1289
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,880
 - It's not best if you maybe threaten someone from a car.

1290
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,520
 Maybe I wonder what I'm gonna do.

1291
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:06,520
 - I'm not a fucking bestie. (laughing)

1292
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:10,800
 - Beep, beep, beep. (laughing)

1293
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,960
 - Oh, good. - And that's so cool.

1294
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,720
 - Yeah, they're really fun. - It's lovely.

1295
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,960
 - There's a really cool hero as well called Carl Buschby.

1296
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,800
 Have you heard of him from Hall?

1297
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,720
 He decided in 1998 he was gonna walk the world, right?

1298
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:26,160
 So he started in Chile and the idea was to end up

1299
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,400
 back in Hall.

1300
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,160
 So it was gonna take him 10 years.

1301
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:31,480
 So he should have been back in 2010.

1302
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:33,040
 - He's still walking. - Did he?

1303
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,240
 - Yeah, why? - Did he not realize

1304
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,560
 that the Atlantic Ocean is in between those two places?

1305
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:39,000
 - Yeah, yeah, it's a bit of a problem.

1306
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,120
 - There must be a land bridge here, something.

1307
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,440
 (laughing)

1308
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:43,660
 - He had so many problems.

1309
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:47,120
 He's expected to end it in September of next year.

1310
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:49,000
 He's still walking. - Do we know where he is?

1311
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,680
 - He was just walking through Turkey

1312
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,960
 and I think he's just crossed the border now.

1313
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:54,800
 So that's good. - That's good.

1314
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,520
 - I mean, it's been really hard because you had to have,

1315
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,920
 you know, three month of eases were a problem

1316
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,360
 when you were walking Russia.

1317
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,640
 You know, like that wasn't it?

1318
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,760
 - I'll tell you what, if he's coming up from Turkey,

1319
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,560
 you know where he's about to go past.

1320
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,200
 - Wow. - Kosovo.

1321
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,400
 - You've got Carl, Carl, you've got to go.

1322
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,680
 - Carl, use your coach, driver,

1323
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:14,200
 and you'll get yourself a pretty statue.

1324
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,360
 (laughing)

1325
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,680
 Stan, not Ollie.

1326
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,520
 (laughing)

1327
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:23,260
 (upbeat music)

1328
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:27,100
 - Okay, that's it, that is all of our facts.

1329
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:28,480
 Thank you so much for listening.

1330
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,500
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

1331
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,020
 about the things that we've said over the course

1332
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:33,960
 of this podcast, we can all be found

1333
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,460
 on our social media accounts.

1334
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:37,580
 I'm on Instagram, on @Sriberland.

1335
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:39,100
 James. - My Instagram is no such thing

1336
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:40,100
 as James Harkin.

1337
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:41,380
 Andy. - I'm on Instagram.

1338
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:42,400
 I'm @Amy.

1339
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,500
 - And Amy.

1340
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:47,300
 - I am @ThatAmyGladhill on Instagram.

1341
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:50,260
 - Yeah, and also if you wanna hear any of Amy's podcasts,

1342
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:51,500
 Amy, where did they go?

1343
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:54,500
 - Well, I think there would be a good Venn diagram overlap

1344
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:58,420
 with Northern News podcast, as James and Andrew have both

1345
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:00,220
 done that, but have been brilliant guests on it.

1346
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:03,600
 And we find news stories from the North,

1347
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,700
 silly funny ones, and we have a laugh about them.

1348
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:08,940
 And then if you're interested in the flirting

1349
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:10,980
 what we've talked about, I also do single ladies

1350
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:13,900
 in your area, and that is about being single

1351
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:14,900
 and how hard that is.

1352
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:18,380
 - It's actually, but it's fun and it's light-hearted.

1353
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:19,220
 - Nice.

1354
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:20,620
 - And Dan, maybe you can come on that one

1355
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:22,420
 'cause if we've had these two on Northern News

1356
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:23,860
 you could be a guest on single ladies.

1357
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:28,340
 - Okay, I am a single lady, so that makes sense.

1358
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:31,300
 But yeah, so definitely go listen to those.

1359
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:33,860
 And if you wanna write into us as a group

1360
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:36,860
 about any of the things that we've said on this podcast

1361
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:40,860
 you can do that by writing to podcast@QI.com.

1362
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:42,820
 All the emails make their way to Andy.

1363
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:44,500
 He loves to cherry pick the best of them

1364
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:47,100
 and they head towards our extra bonus show

1365
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:50,460
 that is sitting in our Special Members Club Club Fish.

1366
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:51,940
 It's called Drop Us Align.

1367
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:54,660
 So send them there, we'll read them out and discuss them.

1368
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:56,060

 Otherwise, do just come back here next week

 'cause we're gonna be back with another episode.

1375
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:09,260
 We'll see you then, goodbye.

1376
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:11,840

1377
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:14,420
