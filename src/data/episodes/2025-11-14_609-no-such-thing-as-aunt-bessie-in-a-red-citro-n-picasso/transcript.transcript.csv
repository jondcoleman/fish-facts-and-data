00:00:00,00:00:03,"Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing There's a Fish"
00:00:03,00:00:07,where we were joined by one of my favourite guests we've ever had.
00:00:07,00:00:08,"I mean, I love them all."
00:00:08,00:00:09,Mmm.
00:00:09,00:00:13,"And even though this one's from Yorkshire, I thought she was brilliant."
00:00:13,00:00:13,Fighting talk.
00:00:13,00:00:16,"Uh, yes, it's the brilliant Amy Gledhill."
00:00:16,00:00:18,"Um, you don't want to miss this episode."
00:00:18,00:00:20,"You're already listening to it, so don't worry."
00:00:20,00:00:22,But it was so much fun to record.
00:00:22,00:00:24,Amy is absolutely terrific.
00:00:24,00:00:25,"It's just really, really fun."
00:00:25,00:00:25,We hope you like it.
00:00:25,00:00:27,The main thing she wanted to let us know about
00:00:27,00:00:31,"was two podcasts that she made. One is called Single Ladies in Your Area,"
00:00:31,00:00:35,"which is her and Harriet Kenzley, and the other is Northern News,"
00:00:35,00:00:38,"which actually, James and I have both been on."
00:00:38,00:00:39,It's her and Ian Smith.
00:00:39,00:00:41,And it's so funny.
00:00:41,00:00:41,It's so funny.
00:00:41,00:00:43,It's just a brilliant show.
00:00:43,00:00:44,It's so good.
00:00:44,00:00:46,"She didn't really say that we should mention this,"
00:00:46,00:00:48,"but we should say also, next year,"
00:00:48,00:00:51,"she's going to be on the last one laughing,"
00:00:51,00:00:53,"is it cold, which everyone loves this year."
00:00:53,00:00:54,"The second season is coming out,"
00:00:54,00:00:55,she's going to be one of the stars of that.
00:00:55,00:00:58,So she's absolutely brilliant comedian.
00:00:58,00:00:59,You're going to love this show.
00:00:59,00:01:01,"You're going to love the 50-minute version,"
00:01:01,00:01:02,which is right here.
00:01:02,00:01:05,"But if you'd like to hear even more Amy,"
00:01:05,00:01:06,then there is a chance to do that.
00:01:06,00:01:11,"And that is by joining our Patreon @ThePlentyMoreFishTier,"

00:01:38,00:01:40,"and honestly, there is a moment in this show"
00:01:40,00:01:43,"where I've known Dan for 20 years,"
00:01:43,00:01:46,and he told me an anecdote about his life that I cannot believe.
00:01:46,00:01:48,You'll know it when you hear it.
00:01:48,00:01:49,"Oh, in the podcast."
00:01:49,00:01:50,On with the show.
00:01:50,00:01:52,[BELL RINGING]
00:01:52,00:02:06,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of ""No Such Thing As A Fish,"""
00:02:06,00:02:10,a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Hobern.
00:02:10,00:02:11,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:02:11,00:02:14,"I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin,"
00:02:14,00:02:15,and Amy Gladhill.
00:02:15,00:02:17,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:02:17,00:02:20,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:02:20,00:02:23,"and in a particular order, here we go."
00:02:23,00:02:26,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Amy."
00:02:26,00:02:28,"Ah, okay."
00:02:28,00:02:33,"In North Carolina, it's illegal to play Bingo for six hours straight."
00:02:33,00:02:34,[LAUGHTER]
00:02:34,00:02:36,I'm sorry if that's sad news for any of you.
00:02:36,00:02:38,Did you learn this the hard way?
00:02:38,00:02:38,[LAUGHTER]
00:02:38,00:02:40,"I just found out, present this morning."
00:02:40,00:02:42,It was real.
00:02:42,00:02:45,"Once you're into Bingo, you can't just stop."
00:02:45,00:02:48,"If you're mid-game and it hits the six-hour point,"
00:02:48,00:02:49,you meant to just duck out.
00:02:49,00:02:50,"Yeah, yeah."
00:02:50,00:02:51,I learned there's a game of Bingo.
00:02:51,00:02:53,It's a long time since I played Bingo.
00:02:53,00:02:53,Is it?
00:02:53,00:02:55,I played at university a few times.
00:02:55,00:02:58,"Is it-- it can't be-- it's multiple games, surely, right?"
00:02:58,00:02:59,It can't just be one game.
00:02:59,00:03:01,What depends on the delivery?
00:03:01,00:03:04,"You know, like the caller can go as slow as he or she likes."
00:03:04,00:03:05,"Yeah, right, you know."
00:03:05,00:03:09,I found that there is actually a Bingo caller
00:03:09,00:03:10,of the year competition.
00:03:10,00:03:11,Oh.
00:03:11,00:03:12,Yeah.
00:03:12,00:03:14,And each region--
00:03:14,00:03:16,I think it's been six regions.
00:03:16,00:03:18,"Each region, you get 10 finalists,"
00:03:18,00:03:21,and then they literally compete like in a live event.
00:03:21,00:03:23,"In it, it says, to be a winner."
00:03:23,00:03:26,"You need to be a bit of a showman or woman, a performer."
00:03:26,00:03:29,You need to enjoy the attention and want to make people smile.
00:03:29,00:03:32,"But you also need to know when to be authoritative, as well."
00:03:32,00:03:35,"An extra talent, such as singing or comedy,"
00:03:35,00:03:35,doesn't hurt either.
00:03:35,00:03:37,Who's doing a song?
00:03:37,00:03:39,Be the Bingo!
00:03:39,00:03:42,"If you were down to one number, and your heart's racing,"
00:03:42,00:03:44,"and then someone's like, make a comeback,"
00:03:44,00:03:46,"and laugh, make a laugh."
00:03:46,00:03:47,Come on!
00:03:47,00:03:51,Do we know if the callers in the call of the year
00:03:51,00:03:53,are they allowed to come up with different calls?
00:03:53,00:03:55,"Like, legs 11, they can do something else."
00:03:55,00:03:57,So interesting.
00:03:57,00:03:58,"Because I found in other countries,"
00:03:58,00:04:01,sometimes they have different calls when they do Bingo.
00:04:01,00:04:02,Right.
00:04:02,00:04:05,"I found that in Russia, they have drumsticks"
00:04:05,00:04:07,instead of legs 11.
00:04:07,00:04:11,"And for 40, they say, ""Ali Baba,"" because he had 40 thieves."
00:04:11,00:04:16,"And when they say, ""43,"" now, when I was younger,"
00:04:16,00:04:21,"the Bingo collar would say, ""Down on your knees, 43."""
00:04:21,00:04:24,I'm not really sure what that meant.
00:04:24,00:04:28,"But in Russia, apparently, they say, ""Stalingrad, 43."""
00:04:28,00:04:29,Oh!
00:04:29,00:04:32,"""Jews, the World War II battle were two million people were killed."""
00:04:32,00:04:33,"So there's a bit grim, isn't it?"
00:04:33,00:04:34,Wow.
00:04:34,00:04:35,Yeah.
00:04:35,00:04:36,I love the calls.
00:04:36,00:04:37,Because I've never played Bingo.
00:04:37,00:04:38,So--
00:04:38,00:04:39,Have you?
00:04:39,00:04:39,"No, what?"
00:04:39,00:04:41,I've never met my life like Bingo.
00:04:41,00:04:42,Have I got a nice help for you?
00:04:42,00:04:45,"Oh, now that I know all the calls, I'd love it."
00:04:45,00:04:46,Number-- what's--
00:04:46,00:04:48,"Number six, Tom Mix."
00:04:48,00:04:49,Do you know who Tom Mix is?
00:04:49,00:04:50,No.
00:04:50,00:04:52,How is Tom Mix made it into Bingo calling?
00:04:52,00:04:54,He was never in it where I used to do--
00:04:54,00:04:55,I've never heard of Tom Mix.
00:04:55,00:04:57,"Tom Mix, he's massive."
00:04:57,00:04:59,He was like American cowboy actor.
00:04:59,00:05:02,He inspired John Wayne and all these other people.
00:05:02,00:05:04,"He's on the cover of ""Sorgeon Peppers Lonely Heartbreak."""
00:05:04,00:05:06,"Yeah, he's one of the cutouts."
00:05:06,00:05:07,Tom Mix.
00:05:07,00:05:08,"You could have, like, Stevie Nicks."
00:05:08,00:05:09,Stevie Nicks.
00:05:09,00:05:10,Little mix.
00:05:10,00:05:11,Little mix.
00:05:11,00:05:13,"I'll tell Dix, I was going to say."
00:05:13,00:05:13,Who's I'll tell Dix?
00:05:13,00:05:15,I'll tell Dix.
00:05:15,00:05:16,Good question.
00:05:16,00:05:18,[LAUGHTER]
00:05:18,00:05:20,"Well, yeah, a lot of the-- you find, when you look at the calls,"
00:05:20,00:05:22,a lot of them date back to the 1920s and '30s.
00:05:22,00:05:24,"Yeah, it's not a game that has moved at the time."
00:05:24,00:05:24,Yeah.
00:05:24,00:05:27,There are occasional attempts to update
00:05:27,00:05:28,what they call Bingo Lingo.
00:05:28,00:05:30,"Oh, yeah."
00:05:30,00:05:33,There was a report five years ago and it's completely
00:05:33,00:05:35,jumped up by a Bingo company.
00:05:35,00:05:37,"Like, that woke millennials were abandoning"
00:05:37,00:05:41,"the traditional calls, and they were being updated instead."
00:05:41,00:05:44,So 38.
00:05:44,00:05:46,Avocado on a plate.
00:05:46,00:05:47,No.
00:05:47,00:05:48,"No, no, no, no."
00:05:48,00:05:49,49.
00:05:49,00:05:51,Time to buy a house.
00:05:51,00:05:52,"Oh, no, it doesn't work."
00:05:52,00:05:53,She's unwind.
00:05:53,00:05:54,I'll call free wine.
00:05:54,00:05:57,I was going to say Amazon Prime.
00:05:57,00:06:00,[LAUGHTER]
00:06:00,00:06:01,Seven.
00:06:01,00:06:03,And don't pay any attention to the rhyme here.
00:06:03,00:06:04,It won't help you.
00:06:04,00:06:05,[LAUGHTER]
00:06:05,00:06:08,The number of David Beckham when he played for Man United.
00:06:08,00:06:09,That's it?
00:06:09,00:06:10,"Oh, it's a Beckham name."
00:06:10,00:06:11,"David Beckham, number seven."
00:06:11,00:06:13,"Yeah, that is good."
00:06:13,00:06:14,"It works, it's not bad, yeah."
00:06:14,00:06:16,It's better than the rhyme they came up with.
00:06:16,00:06:17,OK.
00:06:17,00:06:20,Seven Flexitarian.
00:06:20,00:06:21,Flexitarian.
00:06:21,00:06:22,What's that?
00:06:22,00:06:25,"Someone who is vegetarian, but has a bit of meat sometimes."
00:06:25,00:06:26,Yeah.
00:06:26,00:06:27,"Yeah, OK."
00:06:27,00:06:29,Can I say number seven?
00:06:29,00:06:30,[LAUGHTER]
00:06:30,00:06:33,I'm just going back to North Carolina about why it's illegal
00:06:33,00:06:35,to play Six Hours Straight.
00:06:35,00:06:38,"Basically, all gambling was illegal in North Carolina."
00:06:38,00:06:40,But then there was this thing about charities
00:06:40,00:06:41,wanting to do bingo.
00:06:41,00:06:44,So they had to make it legal so the charities could do it.
00:06:44,00:06:47,But they didn't want to encourage people to open bingo holes
00:06:47,00:06:49,where people get them all the time.
00:06:49,00:06:51,So they put in these really tight restrictions.
00:06:51,00:06:55,So as well as only being able to play for five hours
00:06:55,00:06:58,"at a time, you're not allowed to games of bingo"
00:06:58,00:07:01,within a 48-hour period of each other
00:07:01,00:07:03,"to be held in the same building, right?"
00:07:03,00:07:06,"And also, no alcohol out, which kind of defeats the point,"
00:07:06,00:07:07,"I think, really."
00:07:07,00:07:08,So I didn't think it was a boozy thing.
00:07:08,00:07:12,I think of it as being the tea time.
00:07:12,00:07:13,No.
00:07:13,00:07:16,"Well, these days, they have bingo nights out"
00:07:16,00:07:18,"that you can go on, which are really boozy."
00:07:18,00:07:19,And so do you play bingo?
00:07:19,00:07:20,"Oh, yeah."
00:07:20,00:07:21,Do you?
00:07:21,00:07:22,"Oh, yeah."
00:07:22,00:07:26,I was so cynical about it until about five years ago.
00:07:26,00:07:27,"I was like, who's going to bingo wash?"
00:07:27,00:07:28,Stupid night out?
00:07:28,00:07:29,Who cares if you've got a number on a thing
00:07:29,00:07:31,"and you dabbing, you dabbing on it?"
00:07:31,00:07:34,"And then I went, and it was the most exhilarating thing"
00:07:34,00:07:35,I've ever done.
00:07:35,00:07:36,Really?
00:07:36,00:07:40,"Well, it's absolutely incredible, like I'm getting goosebumps"
00:07:40,00:07:42,thinking about bingo.
00:07:42,00:07:45,It's because it's hard.
00:07:45,00:07:48,"It's like, it's hard to do, which I didn't expect."
00:07:48,00:07:48,Is it?
00:07:48,00:07:50,"Look, I know you're all very intelligent."
00:07:50,00:07:51,Bingo is hard.
00:07:51,00:07:52,And bingo's all the numbers.
00:07:52,00:07:53,I know.
00:07:53,00:07:55,I know the first hundred.
00:07:55,00:07:56,I do know the first hundred.
00:07:56,00:07:59,"And you only need to 90, so you're going to be fine."
00:07:59,00:08:00,"Oh, really?"
00:08:00,00:08:02,"And it goes up to 90, yeah."
00:08:02,00:08:05,"But it's fast, and it's quick, and they take no prisoners."
00:08:05,00:08:08,"And if you go, oh, so what was, they've moved on."
00:08:08,00:08:09,Really?
00:08:09,00:08:10,Much like it's Starlengrad.
00:08:10,00:08:11,No prisoners taken there.
00:08:11,00:08:13,What is it like?
00:08:13,00:08:15,So the kind you were playing that was so exciting.
00:08:15,00:08:16,Yeah.
00:08:16,00:08:17,Was it?
00:08:17,00:08:19,I don't-- I'm not trying to--
00:08:19,00:08:21,I'm not trying to be mean or anything.
00:08:21,00:08:22,What's it?
00:08:22,00:08:24,"Classic bingo, which I would think of as, like,"
00:08:24,00:08:25,blue rinse bingo.
00:08:25,00:08:26,Yeah.
00:08:26,00:08:28,"I'm saying, like, like, fill it all."
00:08:28,00:08:29,Yeah.
00:08:29,00:08:32,And you might have been one of the younger clientele.
00:08:32,00:08:34,I love the way that you're trying to do that.
00:08:34,00:08:36,"What's it in the North, Alie?"
00:08:36,00:08:37,What's it in the North?
00:08:37,00:08:39,Was it elderly ladies in the North?
00:08:39,00:08:41,It was elderly ladies in the North.
00:08:41,00:08:44,We all had chips and gravy.
00:08:44,00:08:47,"There was lots of cups of tea, rattling on the table."
00:08:47,00:08:50,"And then it was silence, like I have never heard before,"
00:08:50,00:08:52,"when they go, eyes down for a full house."
00:08:52,00:08:54,And everyone pin drops it.
00:08:54,00:08:56,You can hate people's heartbeats.
00:08:56,00:08:57,It's so exciting.
00:08:57,00:08:58,It's so exciting.
00:08:58,00:08:59,It's so exciting.
00:08:59,00:09:00,"Yeah, yeah."
00:09:00,00:09:02,How can we get disabled seats to eat?
00:09:02,00:09:03,What was that?
00:09:03,00:09:07,"No way, oh god, you missed the goal."
00:09:07,00:09:09,My way.
00:09:09,00:09:10,"Oh, no!"
00:09:10,00:09:14,"I could see how, like, you could just be in it"
00:09:14,00:09:17,and come out and six hours have gone.
00:09:17,00:09:20,It's only you and 17 granny's are being incarcerated.
00:09:20,00:09:22,[LAUGHTER]
00:09:22,00:09:23,Yeah.
00:09:23,00:09:25,Because I know there are nights now that are things like--
00:09:25,00:09:29,"well, friend of mine was the first ever host of rebel bingo."
00:09:29,00:09:31,And there's bonkers bingo.
00:09:31,00:09:32,There's bongos bingo.
00:09:32,00:09:34,"And they're sort of big, they're like club nights."
00:09:34,00:09:35,They're club nights.
00:09:35,00:09:36,Combined with bingo.
00:09:36,00:09:37,"Full club nights, then."
00:09:37,00:09:37,Yeah.
00:09:37,00:09:39,But they don't sound awful on them.
00:09:39,00:09:44,"No, I actually think your bluerin's bingo is--"
00:09:44,00:09:47,"like, it's a genuinely exhilarating night out."
00:09:47,00:09:50,We should go on a group outing.
00:09:50,00:09:52,I don't think we'd be accepted.
00:09:52,00:09:56,"Because we would make noise, and they would have like it."
00:09:56,00:09:57,We just want to chat to each other.
00:09:57,00:09:57,Yeah.
00:09:57,00:09:58,We do when we're out.
00:09:58,00:10:00,And if you make the single sound--
00:10:00,00:10:01,you'll be leaving over.
00:10:01,00:10:03,Interesting thing about the number 37.
00:10:03,00:10:03,Yes.
00:10:03,00:10:06,"I can tell you, as a last graduate, you are."
00:10:06,00:10:08,Tom Mix was actually on the front of Sarge in front of us.
00:10:08,00:10:11,[LAUGHTER]
00:10:11,00:10:15,"So like, the modern bingo renaissance, let's say,"
00:10:15,00:10:17,"I think came from mecha bingo, right?"
00:10:17,00:10:20,So anyone in the towns of the UK
00:10:20,00:10:23,"will probably have had a mecha bingo, or probably still do."
00:10:23,00:10:25,And this was invented by Eric Morley.
00:10:25,00:10:29,He also invented strictly condensing.
00:10:29,00:10:29,"Oh, wow."
00:10:29,00:10:30,Same guy.
00:10:30,00:10:32,Because he ran the load of dance halls.
00:10:32,00:10:34,And so he wanted to get dance halls to be big.
00:10:34,00:10:36,So he did strictly.
00:10:36,00:10:38,"And also, when dance halls became less popular,"
00:10:38,00:10:40,he brought bingo in there.
00:10:40,00:10:44,"And in 1951, he hosted, and was in charge"
00:10:44,00:10:47,"of the first Miss World contest, as well, Eric Morley."
00:10:47,00:10:48,Legs 11.
00:10:48,00:10:49,Yes.
00:10:49,00:10:50,[LAUGHTER]
00:10:50,00:10:51,No fat lady.
00:10:51,00:10:52,It was--
00:10:52,00:10:55,[LAUGHTER]
00:10:55,00:10:57,The winner was Kiki Hackinson from Sweden.
00:10:57,00:11:00,She was crowned wearing her bikini.
00:11:00,00:11:03,"And the whole event was condemned by friend of the podcast,"
00:11:03,00:11:07,"Pope Pius XII, who said that the whole thing was completely"
00:11:07,00:11:09,sinful and it's really allowed.
00:11:09,00:11:12,And then it basically said the bikini itself was sinful.
00:11:12,00:11:13,Wow.
00:11:13,00:11:13,You know?
00:11:13,00:11:15,Yeah.
00:11:15,00:11:17,Was he wrong with outside?
00:11:17,00:11:18,But comes to condensing.
00:11:18,00:11:21,The TV show is strictly condensing dancing with the stars.
00:11:21,00:11:25,His family are basically still earning off the back of that.
00:11:25,00:11:26,Morley's family.
00:11:26,00:11:27,Morley's family.
00:11:27,00:11:32,"And rather excitingly, he was born in Hobern."
00:11:32,00:11:37,We are within minutes walk of the birth place.
00:11:37,00:11:38,Is there a blue plaque?
00:11:38,00:11:39,I don't know.
00:11:39,00:11:39,There better be.
00:11:39,00:11:41,I doubt it.
00:11:41,00:11:43,"Macabingo got in a bit of trouble, actually."
00:11:43,00:11:45,Around 1997.
00:11:45,00:11:46,Can you guess why?
00:11:46,00:11:48,In 1997.
00:11:48,00:11:49,That won't help you.
00:11:49,00:11:55,Is it something to do with Muslim people praying?
00:11:55,00:11:56,It is.
00:11:56,00:11:57,Is it really?
00:11:57,00:12:03,"It's basically, there were some protests by Muslims saying,"
00:12:03,00:12:05,we don't really think this name is on.
00:12:05,00:12:05,"Oh, yeah, thank you."
00:12:05,00:12:08,Our religion doesn't really go in for gambling.
00:12:08,00:12:10,"Actually, no, I think about it."
00:12:10,00:12:11,I think they have a good pipe there.
00:12:11,00:12:13,"Yeah, it was in Luton."
00:12:13,00:12:16,"And I think maybe they'd opened up in Luton, Macabingo, I mean."
00:12:16,00:12:18,And so I think there's quite big Muslim population there.
00:12:18,00:12:20,And so there were lots of prizes.
00:12:20,00:12:21,There were bricks through the windows.
00:12:21,00:12:24,"I'm afraid it all got a bit, it all got a bit tense for a while."
00:12:24,00:12:26,But it is the holiest city in Islam.
00:12:26,00:12:29,"Yes, but it's also the catchphrase."
00:12:29,00:12:31,"And what it just meant was like, this is a mecca for shopping."
00:12:31,00:12:34,"Or this is only ideal, this is a mecca for dancing."
00:12:34,00:12:37,It just means this is somewhere you go when you want to dance.
00:12:37,00:12:39,"But obviously, where does that word come from?"
00:12:39,00:12:42,I suspect it comes from the fact it's the holiest city in Islam.
00:12:42,00:12:44,"So it led to say, and they said, right, we'll change our name."
00:12:44,00:12:45,And then they didn't.
00:12:45,00:12:46,Right.
00:12:46,00:12:47,Really?
00:12:47,00:12:49,"And 30 years later, it's fine."
00:12:49,00:12:50,And it's still going.
00:12:50,00:12:50,Wow.
00:12:50,00:12:54,"Eric Morley, he was part of the British sort of raising of Bingo."
00:12:54,00:12:58,"But in America, there was an entirely different person called Edwin S. Low,"
00:12:58,00:13:00,who made it massive there.
00:13:00,00:13:02,And he saw it as a game that was being played in carnivals.
00:13:02,00:13:04,"And he thought, this is an amazing idea."
00:13:04,00:13:07,And it wasn't originally called Bingo in America.
00:13:07,00:13:10,"In fact, it had an even more British name that you could imagine."
00:13:10,00:13:11,It was called Bino.
00:13:11,00:13:12,Bino.
00:13:12,00:13:14,Bino was the original name of Bingo.
00:13:14,00:13:16,"You know, it was like an American word for a party, isn't it?"
00:13:16,00:13:17,Yes.
00:13:17,00:13:18,That's right.
00:13:18,00:13:20,"But you know, yeah, like a bean feast, I guess."
00:13:20,00:13:21,Yeah.
00:13:21,00:13:22,Wow.
00:13:22,00:13:23,Good old bean feast.
00:13:23,00:13:25,You don't get enough of a feast there.
00:13:25,00:13:30,Can I tell you a couple of quick calls that are specifically military?
00:13:30,00:13:31,"Oh, OK."
00:13:31,00:13:37,Because a lot of it dates back to the early 20th century or even the late 19th century.
00:13:37,00:13:44,"And the army had allowed Bingo, partly because they wanted to allow not total gambling,"
00:13:44,00:13:45,but a kind of form.
00:13:45,00:13:46,It was a really popular game.
00:13:46,00:13:47,And it is gambling.
00:13:47,00:13:50,"And really, everyone puts a bit of money in and the winner gets it all."
00:13:50,00:13:52,So it's not like a mess.
00:13:52,00:13:54,"It's not quite, it's not like, I don't know, slot machines or whatever."
00:13:54,00:13:55,Yeah.
00:13:55,00:13:56,So does the House ever win?
00:13:56,00:13:57,Does the game end when no one's playing?
00:13:57,00:13:58,No.
00:13:58,00:14:00,House never wins.
00:14:00,00:14:03,But loads of the rhyming calls traditionally date back to the 19th century military.
00:14:03,00:14:06,"He said, cause it had been allowed in the army in the first place."
00:14:06,00:14:08,So 51?
00:14:08,00:14:09,"Well, it's my gun."
00:14:09,00:14:11,"Oh, very nice."
00:14:11,00:14:13,The Highland Division.
00:14:13,00:14:13,Of course.
00:14:13,00:14:16,"So catchy, isn't it?"
00:14:16,00:14:18,"And there's also, was she worth it?"
00:14:18,00:14:19,Seven and six?
00:14:19,00:14:20,I don't know why that is seven and six.
00:14:20,00:14:23,"It was the price of a lady of the night, or?"
00:14:23,00:14:26,"It was the price of a marriage, certificate."
00:14:26,00:14:32,"Oh, yeah, yeah, I mean, similar, similar vengeance, but it's like that."
00:14:32,00:14:35,"That says a lot about my relationship, isn't it?"
00:14:35,00:14:38,"Ah, a sex worker, a wife."
00:14:38,00:14:39,"Oh, that's it, yeah, yeah."
00:14:39,00:14:43,"Well, the country, though, if they were to say price, if you were sent off again."
00:14:43,00:14:46,Why did they put the marriage certificate off his neck to the brothel?
00:14:46,00:14:50,"Oh, how did you know that, Amy?"
00:14:50,00:14:52,Just straight out there.
00:14:52,00:14:53,That was the price.
00:14:53,00:14:54,Seven and six was the price of a marriage.
00:14:54,00:14:58,Sometimes bingo knowledge is just in my bones.
00:14:58,00:14:59,Yeah.
00:14:59,00:15:00,I'm really impressed.
00:15:00,00:15:04,"All right, well, last one, Pompi Hort, 24."
00:15:04,00:15:05,"Oh, dear."
00:15:05,00:15:06,"Oh, that's..."
00:15:06,00:15:07,That's Portsmouth.
00:15:07,00:15:08,Portsmouth sailors on leave.
00:15:08,00:15:09,"Oh, no."
00:15:09,00:15:11,"Sorry, that's where I met my wife."
00:15:11,00:15:12,Yeah.
00:15:12,00:15:13,Wife.
00:15:13,00:15:14,Yeah.
00:15:20,00:15:23,"OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy."
00:15:23,00:15:28,"My point is that in 2010, it was reported that pizza or express was training its staff"
00:15:28,00:15:32,how to flirt subtly with customers so they felt more relaxed.
00:15:32,00:15:34,Is it more relaxing?
00:15:34,00:15:36,"I wouldn't, it depends on the flirting, doesn't it?"
00:15:36,00:15:37,Yeah.
00:15:37,00:15:39,"But it's just someone being friendly and attentive, but is that flirting?"
00:15:39,00:15:40,"No, really?"
00:15:40,00:15:41,"No, really, no."
00:15:41,00:15:45,"This was reported, basically, as just a thing that pizza or express for trying."
00:15:45,00:15:49,"I think it was in their Richmond branch, and they'd hired an actor to train the staff"
00:15:49,00:15:54,"to just, you know, be a bit extra friendly, I suppose."
00:15:54,00:15:57,He said there's a difference between flirting with someone and coming onto them.
00:15:57,00:15:59,We're not asking them to do that.
00:15:59,00:16:00,That would be mad.
00:16:00,00:16:01,Yeah.
00:16:01,00:16:05,"It would slow down service among other things, you know?"
00:16:05,00:16:08,"But if you're a guy in a really gorgeous Italian girl comes to your table, it's great to"
00:16:08,00:16:09,meet somebody like that.
00:16:09,00:16:10,"And says, ""Doble, sir?"""
00:16:10,00:16:15,"No, it's just the way I'm sat."
00:16:15,00:16:21,"Yeah, and it's even better to hear her talk with passion and authenticity about the"
00:16:21,00:16:22,ingredients on the menu.
00:16:22,00:16:23,That's the flotation we're talking about.
00:16:23,00:16:26,"Again, I just think that falls under normal weight-resign."
00:16:26,00:16:30,"Also, I don't know if Mr James knew how many of the pizza or express staff are actually"
00:16:30,00:16:34,"Italian, because it's certainly around my local, it's not required."
00:16:34,00:16:35,No.
00:16:35,00:16:37,"Maybe, maybe people like flirting with you."
00:16:37,00:16:38,"Maybe that's just a natural thing, Andy."
00:16:38,00:16:39,"Oh, they're not flirting."
00:16:39,00:16:40,"No, no, no, no."
00:16:40,00:16:41,Absolutely not.
00:16:41,00:16:45,"I don't know, so they didn't take it beyond this first and only pizza express."
00:16:45,00:16:48,"They reported that they were considering rolling it out, and there the trail goes cold."
00:16:48,00:16:49,Right.
00:16:49,00:16:50,Yeah.
00:16:50,00:16:55,"It would be very tricky for the staff to hear one day, like, ""Oh, the job roll has changed"
00:16:55,00:16:56,ever so slightly.
00:16:56,00:16:58,"You're still serving the pizza, he's still taking the orders."
00:16:58,00:17:02,"You do need to sort of, really sexually excite the customers now."""
00:17:02,00:17:03,Excuse me?
00:17:03,00:17:04,Yeah.
00:17:04,00:17:08,"It's like, you do the doubles, you know, you make sure they've had the starters, and then"
00:17:08,00:17:12,"you just sort of look at the lips a lot, and you're like, ""No, obviously you're not going"
00:17:12,00:17:13,"to need the orders."""
00:17:13,00:17:17,"If someone lots of my lips, when I was in pizza express, I would assume I had a knowledge"
00:17:17,00:17:18,on that.
00:17:18,00:17:19,Yeah.
00:17:19,00:17:20,Yeah.
00:17:20,00:17:25,Flirting is actively not encouraged in quite a lot of industries.
00:17:25,00:17:26,"They actively say, ""Don't flirt."""
00:17:26,00:17:29,I saw a headline talking about New York taxi drivers.
00:17:29,00:17:31,This was genuinely the headline.
00:17:31,00:17:33,I think it was in the independent.
00:17:33,00:17:38,"New York taxi drivers to be banned from flirting with, or ejaculating on passengers."
00:17:38,00:17:42,I think flirting can go too far at times.
00:17:42,00:17:46,"I mean, he's facing the wrong way."
00:17:46,00:17:47,Or she?
00:17:47,00:17:48,But...
00:17:48,00:17:54,"You'll never guess who I ejaculate, you know, last week."
00:17:54,00:17:58,"Damn, what is this headline?"
00:17:58,00:18:04,"It was just New York officials that said that they'd need to ban, because flirting would"
00:18:04,00:18:08,"be happening, and people were complaining, and they had people writing in saying, ""I'm"
00:18:08,00:18:12,"sorry, I feel uncomfortable in the back of the cab when I'm being flirted with,"" and all"
00:18:12,00:18:13,ejaculated on.
00:18:13,00:18:14,"No, stop it, Jack."
00:18:14,00:18:15,Wow.
00:18:15,00:18:21,"But for it to be banned, it must be happening at a frequency that's enough for it to need"
00:18:21,00:18:22,banning.
00:18:22,00:18:27,"I actually think they're already lashing it to ejaculate, sorry, Sam, that's banning already."
00:18:27,00:18:34,"That's the sauna in Leeds, where there's a sign in the sauna that says, ""Do not piss."""
00:18:34,00:18:35,"And it says, ""Piss."""
00:18:35,00:18:36,"It doesn't say, ""You're in there."""
00:18:36,00:18:41,"There's ""Do not piss on the coals,"" and you're like, ""Well, how often is it happening?"""
00:18:41,00:18:44,But they needed a sign.
00:18:44,00:18:47,"You'd be mad to put up, and no one has ever pissed on the coals."
00:18:47,00:18:48,Absolutely.
00:18:48,00:18:51,"Because, in a way, I'd be like, ""Well, I never thought of that."""
00:18:51,00:18:53,A lot of it steams more than what.
00:18:53,00:18:57,"So question, is it worse to piss on the coals, and put, ""As in, is that going into your"
00:18:57,00:18:58,"pores?"""
00:18:58,00:18:59,You know?
00:18:59,00:19:00,I don't know.
00:19:00,00:19:01,"No, it'll be fine."
00:19:01,00:19:02,It'll be fine.
00:19:02,00:19:03,It'll be fine.
00:19:03,00:19:04,"Because it's water, it'll be fine."
00:19:04,00:19:06,Are you the person that piss?
00:19:06,00:19:07,I'm not defending it.
00:19:07,00:19:08,I'm just saying.
00:19:08,00:19:10,It also contains urea.
00:19:10,00:19:11,Right.
00:19:11,00:19:14,And that's not going to mean that there's going to be an ammonia in the air when you...
00:19:14,00:19:15,"There'll be an ammonia in the air, definitely."
00:19:15,00:19:17,No one's denying that.
00:19:17,00:19:19,Just saying is...
00:19:19,00:19:22,There will be a tang in the air.
00:19:22,00:19:25,Just don't know if breathing in vaporised pisses.
00:19:25,00:19:26,I know it's not nice.
00:19:26,00:19:29,"I know it's not nice, but I just don't know if it's..."
00:19:29,00:19:30,"It depends how much, doesn't it?"
00:19:30,00:19:31,Quantity is all.
00:19:31,00:19:32,That's the problem.
00:19:32,00:19:33,You're on there.
00:19:33,00:19:34,"It's like, ""I just don't know if it's any worse, you're on there."""
00:19:34,00:19:35,I would just...
00:19:35,00:19:38,"Based on the calls, I don't think it affects anything."
00:19:38,00:19:39,Did you see this firstly?
00:19:39,00:19:40,"Yeah, just this firstly."
00:19:40,00:19:44,"And then I was like, ""Pull your pants back up, okay?"""
00:19:44,00:19:45,Whoops.
00:19:45,00:19:46,Oh no.
00:19:46,00:19:47,Oh no.
00:19:47,00:19:48,Oh no.
00:19:48,00:19:49,Oh no.
00:19:49,00:19:50,Oh no.
00:19:50,00:19:51,God.
00:19:51,00:19:52,Yeah.
00:19:52,00:19:53,Don't piss on my pants.
00:19:53,00:19:54,It sounds like a saying.
00:19:54,00:19:56,Like I wouldn't piss on his coal.
00:19:56,00:19:57,You know?
00:19:57,00:19:59,Yes.
00:19:59,00:20:00,So flirting.
00:20:00,00:20:01,Yeah.
00:20:01,00:20:03,"I mean, you make a show about..."
00:20:03,00:20:04,I love dating romance.
00:20:04,00:20:05,Yes.
00:20:05,00:20:06,Yeah.
00:20:06,00:20:07,"Call no than news, no."
00:20:07,00:20:08,Call single ladies in your area.
00:20:08,00:20:09,Single ladies.
00:20:09,00:20:10,Okay.
00:20:10,00:20:12,"I just wanted to ask, if you have encountered this..."
00:20:12,00:20:13,Okay.
00:20:13,00:20:14,Because you have been on dating absence.
00:20:14,00:20:15,"Oh, yeah."
00:20:15,00:20:16,Big time.
00:20:16,00:20:22,Have you encountered people flirting with you who you suspect of using artificial intelligence?
00:20:22,00:20:23,Hmm.
00:20:23,00:20:25,I've never considered that.
00:20:25,00:20:29,Because this is the thing that's been coming up in the news more and more this year.
00:20:29,00:20:34,People are basically coming up with responses to questions by putting it into chat GPT or whatever.
00:20:34,00:20:35,And then saying...
00:20:35,00:20:36,"No, no, no, no."
00:20:36,00:20:41,And then people are going on dates with them and finding you're not interesting or funny at all.
00:20:41,00:20:42,Wow.
00:20:42,00:20:44,Because everything they've done has basically been mediated through.
00:20:44,00:20:47,And sometimes you'll get two people using chat GPT talking to each other.
00:20:47,00:20:51,And there's basically two robots talking to each other using the medium of humans.
00:20:51,00:20:52,Wow.
00:20:52,00:20:53,It's...
00:20:53,00:20:54,I know.
00:20:54,00:20:55,But you haven't found that.
00:20:55,00:21:01,"And I don't... I don't think so. And if they are using chat GPT and that's been punched up,"
00:21:01,00:21:04,I would hate to see what they started with.
00:21:04,00:21:10,"Because if they need chat GPT to get to what you've been up to this weekend question mark kiss,"
00:21:10,00:21:14,then what AI is not taking over.
00:21:14,00:21:17,The person who...
00:21:17,00:21:24,One of founders of Bumble who's Whitney Wolf heard reckons that soon we'll be able to have sort of AI versions of ourselves
00:21:24,00:21:31,that have basically all of my lines or things that I would be likely to say will be in this AI version.
00:21:31,00:21:36,And then you might have your AI version and our two AI's can meet and see if they get on.
00:21:36,00:21:40,"And if our little robot speed can get on, then we will get on in real life."
00:21:40,00:21:42,"Yeah, I mean, it kind of makes sense."
00:21:42,00:21:43,It makes sense.
00:21:43,00:21:44,Yeah.
00:21:44,00:21:45,Is that a world you want to live in?
00:21:45,00:21:46,It's true.
00:21:46,00:21:47,It's odd.
00:21:47,00:21:48,I'm out of that world now.
00:21:48,00:21:49,"Have there a opinion on it, really?"
00:21:49,00:21:56,"I suppose the experience of being on the apps is so boring and annoying and lots of people chat to you for a bit,"
00:21:56,00:21:58,then they just disappear without anything.
00:21:58,00:22:02,I can imagine any shortcut to not doing that anymore would be a good thing.
00:22:02,00:22:03,Yeah.
00:22:03,00:22:04,"Well, I tried it."
00:22:04,00:22:10,I tried chat GPT-generated flirting on my wife.
00:22:10,00:22:11,"Oh, okay."
00:22:11,00:22:15,"But I just asked chat GPT, can you come up with something flirtatious for me to say to my wife?"
00:22:15,00:22:20,"Yeah, line one, your laugh is my favourite song and your arms are my favourite place to be."
00:22:20,00:22:21,"Oh, yeah."
00:22:21,00:22:22,"She said, okay."
00:22:22,00:22:30,"And then I thought, this is going well."
00:22:30,00:22:32,I'll follow it up.
00:22:32,00:22:33,You still give me butterflies.
00:22:33,00:22:37,"I must have done something amazing to deserve you as you said, what's going on?"
00:22:37,00:22:39,It's just like what?
00:22:39,00:22:40,Very much.
00:22:40,00:22:42,Have you crashed the car?
00:22:42,00:22:43,Yeah.
00:22:43,00:22:46,"And then I said, I would love to answer this, but you have no more free chats left."
00:22:46,00:22:49,Please upgrade the pro to continue.
00:22:49,00:22:50,That sealed the deal.
00:22:50,00:22:51,"She said, you got me."
00:22:51,00:22:52,Yeah.
00:22:52,00:22:54,Upstairs now.
00:22:54,00:22:59,"Wow, we, that's amazing."
00:22:59,00:23:00,"No, Grim."
00:23:00,00:23:06,Can I tell you some historical flirting techniques from Lanccia where I'm from?
00:23:06,00:23:07,"Oh, okay."
00:23:07,00:23:12,There was a thing called promenading or promenading where a load of boys and girls
00:23:12,00:23:14,stand on opposite sides of a road to each other.
00:23:14,00:23:15,And they wouldn't say anything.
00:23:15,00:23:20,They'd just try and make eye contact with each other and sort of like smile and stuff like that.
00:23:20,00:23:23,And then everyone would go home.
00:23:23,00:23:27,"And if the girl fancyed the boy, she would leave a cake outside his house."
00:23:27,00:23:29,And then that would mean they were dating.
00:23:29,00:23:30,So you would know.
00:23:30,00:23:31,Wow.
00:23:31,00:23:32,Feels like I could create confusion.
00:23:32,00:23:36,What if you were able to eye contact with two people and you have found one cake outside your house?
00:23:36,00:23:37,Yeah.
00:23:37,00:23:39,Maybe the cake has the name on it.
00:23:39,00:23:40,That's a good idea.
00:23:40,00:23:43,"Or is it still my day, Dan?"
00:23:43,00:23:44,Still my day.
00:23:44,00:23:45,Still my day.
00:23:45,00:23:47,Got the seven and six ready.
00:23:47,00:23:52,And this is early 20th century.
00:23:52,00:23:54,So a little bit before my day.
00:23:54,00:23:56,Just on the cast.
00:23:56,00:24:00,"And then there's a guy called Spanking Roger, who's one of my favourite people in history."
00:24:00,00:24:01,"Oh, yeah."
00:24:01,00:24:08,And he got together with his partner through a thing that used to happen on the malls just outside Manchester.
00:24:08,00:24:13,And they would have a naked race of all the young lads in the town.
00:24:13,00:24:18,And then the girls would sort of stand there watching and sort of eye up the form of everyone there.
00:24:18,00:24:22,"And then a bit later they'd all go down the pub and they'd go, yeah, like the look at you."
00:24:22,00:24:23,"Oh, my god."
00:24:23,00:24:25,He was called Spanking's Banking Roger.
00:24:25,00:24:27,"Yeah, because he was also a boxer."
00:24:27,00:24:28,"No, no."
00:24:28,00:24:29,"I was like, something."
00:24:29,00:24:32,Something heard the question.
00:24:32,00:24:36,"No, he would beat people up, like beat people in the ring."
00:24:36,00:24:38,And he'd give you a shot.
00:24:38,00:24:40,"He'd give you a, he'd give you a spanking."
00:24:40,00:24:41,"Yeah, right, right."
00:24:41,00:24:42,Wow.
00:24:42,00:24:43,Like a live naked attraction.
00:24:43,00:24:44,Yeah.
00:24:44,00:24:46,"But moving, like moving, yeah."
00:24:46,00:24:47,Those are naked attractions.
00:24:47,00:24:49,You don't know how well they can move.
00:24:49,00:24:50,"They're just standing there, aren't they?"
00:24:50,00:24:52,It's a good point actually.
00:24:52,00:24:53,That's a really good point.
00:24:53,00:24:56,"Tell me, Amy, why do humans fly?"
00:24:56,00:24:57,Why do humans fly?
00:24:57,00:25:02,"Like, why do we not just come up to each other and say, I want to have sex with you and then have children that way?"
00:25:02,00:25:03,"Oh, I don't know."
00:25:03,00:25:06,It's much easier if we're allowed to do that with Nick.
00:25:06,00:25:07,God.
00:25:07,00:25:09,I honestly think that would be fantastic.
00:25:09,00:25:12,"If, but you could all just be honest and be like, you're physically attractive."
00:25:12,00:25:15,And I think we should put our meat sacks together.
00:25:15,00:25:17,"Like, I think that would just be so much easier."
00:25:17,00:25:18,But I don't know.
00:25:18,00:25:20,So there's a New York taxi driver listening to this right now.
00:25:20,00:25:21,On breach.
00:25:21,00:25:30,I guess there must be some sort of evolutionary thing.
00:25:30,00:25:32,Is it to see if you're like a good match?
00:25:32,00:25:33,"Kind of, yes."
00:25:33,00:25:38,So the problem is that humans used to spend a lot of time in very small groups.
00:25:38,00:25:43,"And if you decide that you want to get together with someone and they were buff you,"
00:25:43,00:25:46,you can't just move to London.
00:25:46,00:25:49,And then sort of move to a new place and get a new life or anything.
00:25:49,00:25:50,You're stuck in that place.
00:25:50,00:25:57,So the only way to do it is to give very sort of small signals that you can deny if someone says.
00:25:57,00:25:59,"So it's deny ability, basically."
00:25:59,00:26:01,That's clever.
00:26:01,00:26:04,Because there is this thing of lots of people don't know when they're being flirted with.
00:26:04,00:26:05,Yeah.
00:26:05,00:26:08,"And I'm afraid Amy, women are especially bad at it."
00:26:08,00:26:10,It's just your personal opinion.
00:26:10,00:26:13,"You're like, I fly all the time."
00:26:13,00:26:15,You don't want to give me anything bad.
00:26:15,00:26:18,"Genetically, they're just not good at it."
00:26:18,00:26:21,"Actually, it's women and men."
00:26:21,00:26:28,So women sort of sometimes under perceive when they're being flirted with and men over perceive it.
00:26:28,00:26:37,So it will often be like male students when asked that they're like clear than women to misinterpret friendly gestures as sexual interest.
00:26:37,00:26:41,"And many mistake, but many people do mistake sexual cues as amicable signals."
00:26:41,00:26:46,"But often, if you're a straight man, the nervous woman smiling at you is not flirting with you."
00:26:46,00:26:50,"She's nervous and you're thinking, she's flirting with me and women underestimate her."
00:26:50,00:26:55,"And there is a theory that this leads to the idea of the friend zone, which is not a real,"
00:26:55,00:26:58,or it's the idea that the friend zone is not a real thing.
00:26:58,00:27:00,It's that people are just drastically misinterpreting each other's cues.
00:27:00,00:27:02,"And men are saying, I've been friend zoned."
00:27:02,00:27:05,"And actually, that's not what has happened."
00:27:05,00:27:08,It's just that she's just not that into you to go on a phrase.
00:27:08,00:27:10,"And so, yeah, yeah, it's tricky."
00:27:10,00:27:16,"And I think a lot of women, I think you are really having to be friendly if you're like feeling unsafe."
00:27:16,00:27:20,"So you're like, if you're like on a train and a scary man's, it's next to you."
00:27:20,00:27:26,"And he might think he's flirting and you kind of can't say, please don't talk to me."
00:27:26,00:27:27,I hate this.
00:27:27,00:27:30,"So you have to go like, oh, really?"
00:27:30,00:27:31,"Oh, that's nice."
00:27:31,00:27:33,"He'll be like, she's into it."
00:27:33,00:27:36,"But you're thinking, don't harm me, don't kill me, don't fight."
00:27:36,00:27:37,I don't where I live.
00:27:37,00:27:43,"But you're, I guess you're giving off kind of friendly-ish signals as a kind of safety device."
00:27:43,00:27:46,"And I guess guys will be like, she loves this."
00:27:46,00:27:53,"There is only one way around this. And that is boys on one side of the road, girls on the other side of the road."
00:27:53,00:27:55,"Yeah, there's subtle links."
00:27:55,00:27:58,I think any flirting with cakes is fantastic.
00:27:58,00:28:01,Can I tell you something very quickly that I found that that links in?
00:28:01,00:28:04,I guess sexy stuff and pizza and poems.
00:28:04,00:28:05,"Oh, yeah."
00:28:05,00:28:06,"Oh, wow."
00:28:06,00:28:11,Okay. So there was an article that said that pizza hot response a furious whole customer
00:28:11,00:28:15,who claims ketchup bottle label sounds like swingers app.
00:28:15,00:28:20,"So I was like, well, what the hell are they calling their ketchup and pizza hot?"
00:28:20,00:28:22,Do you want to guess what they name it?
00:28:22,00:28:24,Squirties.
00:28:24,00:28:25,Yeah.
00:28:25,00:28:28,"So they call it shake, squeeze and squirt."
00:28:28,00:28:31,"And he was like, that is too sexual."
00:28:31,00:28:32,I think it's it.
00:28:32,00:28:33,It says quite directions.
00:28:33,00:28:35,I think it's on a ketchup bottle.
00:28:35,00:28:36,I think it's not too sexual.
00:28:36,00:28:37,Yeah.
00:28:37,00:28:38,Context is all.
00:28:38,00:28:39,Yeah.
00:28:39,00:28:40,Yeah.
00:28:40,00:28:42,It's a penis tattoo.
00:28:42,00:28:46,"If you just tap it on the top, it'll come up."
00:28:46,00:28:47,Yeah.
00:28:47,00:28:51,Turn it upside down and bang the bottom really hard.
00:28:51,00:28:52,It doesn't work.
00:28:52,00:28:53,Stick enough today.
00:28:53,00:29:02,Okay.
00:29:02,00:29:04,It is time for fact number three.
00:29:04,00:29:05,And that is my fact.
00:29:05,00:29:11,"My fact this week is that in 1931, Laurel and Hardy simultaneously filmed up to five"
00:29:11,00:29:16,"versions of every movie that they made, each time, speaking in a different language,"
00:29:16,00:29:19,despite the fact that they only knew English.
00:29:19,00:29:20,Lovely.
00:29:20,00:29:25,"But this is this is a fascinating bit of Hollywood, which often doesn't get mentioned,"
00:29:25,00:29:30,"which is when it was the silent era, when you were sending movies over to Europe or any other country,"
00:29:30,00:29:31,it was very easy.
00:29:31,00:29:33,"You replaced the card with the words on it, right?"
00:29:33,00:29:37,And so people had these massive fan bases all over the world.
00:29:37,00:29:40,"Laurel and Hardy in particular had a big, big fan base in Spain and Italy."
00:29:40,00:29:42,And Italy and other countries in Europe.
00:29:42,00:29:47,"And then when it became the talky movies, suddenly they were not understanding it."
00:29:47,00:29:50,And they didn't have the technology to do subtitles at the time.
00:29:50,00:29:55,"So what used to happen was, and this was an idea of Hal Roach, who was this amazing movie mogul,"
00:29:55,00:30:00,"he said, we're going to film every single scene of everything you film from now,"
00:30:00,00:30:02,up to five different languages.
00:30:02,00:30:06,And they had to learn phonetically how to say all of the dialogue.
00:30:06,00:30:10,There was half an hour of rehearsals for each scene where they had to learn the phrases.
00:30:10,00:30:14,They had speech coaches of the language there with them telling them to do it.
00:30:14,00:30:18,You know what I thought when I read this is there's no way they did it very well.
00:30:18,00:30:21,"Because as someone who's learning a language right now,"
00:30:21,00:30:25,"you can know exactly how to say something, but you try and say it."
00:30:25,00:30:27,"And so a native speaker, it doesn't quite sound right?"
00:30:27,00:30:29,"Yeah, so that's definitely true."
00:30:29,00:30:32,"And I think the interesting thing that was, I read a report about it,"
00:30:32,00:30:40,"which said, Spanish audiences took special satisfaction in seeing Laurel Orhardy squirming under the burden of a difficult castellium phrase."
00:30:40,00:30:44,"And so it's sort of almost funnier, seeing knowing that they're having to do it,"
00:30:44,00:30:46,and knowing they can't do it very well.
00:30:46,00:30:48,Everyone else was a perfect speaker.
00:30:48,00:30:50,So they surrounded them in the different way.
00:30:50,00:30:52,So all the other actors were perfect.
00:30:52,00:30:56,"I presume, or maybe they subbed in the actors and like said, right, get the Spanish cast in now."
00:30:56,00:30:58,"They'll do it with them. So yeah, that might have been it."
00:30:58,00:31:03,"A lot of these movies are now lost because they weren't the main thing that people were keeping for posterity, right?"
00:31:03,00:31:05,Like the English-speaking versions were.
00:31:05,00:31:07,But it's exactly that. They loved it.
00:31:07,00:31:11,"Laurel Orhardy could just mumble a sentence, you know, that doesn't matter. It's comedy."
00:31:11,00:31:12,It's fine.
00:31:12,00:31:13,Yeah.
00:31:13,00:31:15,We just want to see them falling over with the piano.
00:31:15,00:31:16,Yeah.
00:31:16,00:31:21,"I bet they knew how to say, oh no, piano in so many different languages."
00:31:21,00:31:24,"Yeah, the thing about piano is it's the same in almost every language."
00:31:24,00:31:25,"Yeah, perfect."
00:31:25,00:31:31,"But yeah, I was thinking about double acts because Amy, you're part of a double act to work."
00:31:31,00:31:32,Still am.
00:31:32,00:31:33,Still am.
00:31:33,00:31:34,The delightful sausage.
00:31:34,00:31:35,Yeah.
00:31:35,00:31:36,Yeah.
00:31:36,00:31:37,It's catchy name.
00:31:37,00:31:39,We never thought we would be a double act.
00:31:39,00:31:41,We just needed to run a comedy night together.
00:31:41,00:31:43,"And we said, what should we call it?"
00:31:43,00:31:46,"And Chris had literally just had breakfast and he said, that was a delightful sausage."
00:31:46,00:31:48,"And we were like, yeah, yeah, that'll do that."
00:31:48,00:31:51,"Ten years later, we're like, we should have thought about that name just like a bit more."
00:31:51,00:31:52,It's a great name.
00:31:52,00:31:53,It's a great name.
00:31:53,00:32:00,"I mean, the word sausage is the funniest word in the world, which we recently learned as part of no such thing as a fish that the word"
00:32:00,00:32:07,sausage has been in our titles more than any other word out there outside of like with and or so on.
00:32:07,00:32:08,So number one word.
00:32:08,00:32:10,So you're onto something.
00:32:10,00:32:11,Wow.
00:32:11,00:32:12,Because you could have gone something and something.
00:32:12,00:32:13,Yeah.
00:32:13,00:32:14,"Something, yeah."
00:32:14,00:32:17,"Like Laurel and Harvey is the classic one, you know, Cannibal, Helen pace, all of that."
00:32:17,00:32:20,"All those things like the mighty bush, where it's not clear that it's a double act."
00:32:20,00:32:21,Yes.
00:32:21,00:32:25,"I reckon the mighty bush is similar to your name because that's named after his hair, wasn't it?"
00:32:25,00:32:27,"Like, you know, you're feeling so active."
00:32:27,00:32:28,You got a mighty bush.
00:32:28,00:32:29,Yeah.
00:32:29,00:32:30,Oh my god.
00:32:30,00:32:32,So it's one of you got it.
00:32:32,00:32:34,He's floating.
00:32:34,00:32:35,He's floating.
00:32:35,00:32:36,I feel safe.
00:32:36,00:32:44,"But yeah, Chris does have a huge bush."
00:32:44,00:32:49,"Hey, there's another technique by the way that I've seen a double act using comedy where they don't speak the language."
00:32:49,00:32:56,"Rick Maill and Adrian Edmondson, they often used to speak backwards in their scenes."
00:32:56,00:33:06,"So guesthouse parodies so their movie, they would speak backwards a line because the comedy stunt that they were doing was so dangerous that it only worked if you played it in reverse."
00:33:06,00:33:13,"So rather than throwing spiky nails into the nose of Rick Maill, you would take them out with him, go."
00:33:13,00:33:17,And then you would get the line played forward and the scene played forward.
00:33:17,00:33:20,"For me, do you know what the word sausage is backwards?"
00:33:20,00:33:21,Jesus.
00:33:21,00:33:22,Jesus.
00:33:22,00:33:23,sausage.
00:33:23,00:33:25,Oh my god.
00:33:25,00:33:27,"Well, son of, yeah."
00:33:27,00:33:29,Oh my god.
00:33:29,00:33:30,Wow.
00:33:30,00:33:31,Damn it.
00:33:31,00:33:34,I think guesthouse parodies are about five times.
00:33:34,00:33:35,I didn't know that.
00:33:35,00:33:36,I didn't know that.
00:33:36,00:33:38,It's in the bonus VHS.
00:33:38,00:33:39,There we go.
00:33:39,00:33:40,Documentary.
00:33:40,00:33:45,No one watches the bonuses like you don't.
00:33:45,00:33:46,It's such a good film.
00:33:46,00:33:47,It's great.
00:33:47,00:33:48,Laurel and Hardy.
00:33:48,00:33:50,Have you seen any of the stuff I mean?
00:33:50,00:33:57,"Yeah, I have seen stuff, but I wouldn't say, you know, is it ridiculous to explain who they are to an audience?"
00:33:57,00:33:58,I think so.
00:33:58,00:33:59,Young people.
00:33:59,00:34:00,Yeah.
00:34:00,00:34:01,Comedy double act.
00:34:01,00:34:10,"Stan Oro was tall and thin and legubris looking and Oli Hardy was, and British and Oli Hardy was sort of a big, big fellow with the moustache and"
00:34:10,00:34:16,Laurel was always doing silly things and Oli Hardy was always annoyed with him and they were mega-famous.
00:34:16,00:34:17,They were sort of globally famous.
00:34:17,00:34:23,"If you name any other, like Silent Moves, like Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, they're in absolutely that sort of echelon."
00:34:23,00:34:26,And I'd started looking into their lives.
00:34:26,00:34:31,So Oliver Hardy had a very interesting early life.
00:34:31,00:34:33,So his real name was Norvell.
00:34:33,00:34:38,"But his father, Oliver Hardy's dad, fought in the American Civil War."
00:34:38,00:34:39,"Yeah, really?"
00:34:39,00:34:41,What is the timeline of that?
00:34:41,00:34:42,Isn't that nuts?
00:34:42,00:34:45,Was it like a hilarious sort of battle that he was in?
00:34:45,00:34:47,[laughter]
00:34:47,00:34:50,"20,000 people were killed in that custard pie fight."
00:34:50,00:34:51,Yeah.
00:34:51,00:34:54,"Yeah, no, his father was a sergeant in the Confederate army."
00:34:54,00:34:56,That's the 1860s.
00:34:56,00:34:59,And then Oliver Hardy was born in 1892.
00:34:59,00:35:00,So it all worked.
00:35:00,00:35:04,"He fought in the Civil War as a very young man, and then 30 years later he had Oliver."
00:35:04,00:35:08,"But like, yeah, it's extraordinary. All his grandfather was a slave owner."
00:35:08,00:35:09,Right.
00:35:09,00:35:10,Oh my God.
00:35:10,00:35:14,The generations you have to go to get back to that period.
00:35:14,00:35:15,It's so few.
00:35:15,00:35:16,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:35:16,00:35:17,Yeah.
00:35:17,00:35:23,"He's famous, while we're just mentioning their sort of classic traits, for looking at the camera with a really frustrated face."
00:35:23,00:35:25,Like the Miranda.
00:35:25,00:35:28,Like the Miranda looking exactly like that.
00:35:28,00:35:35,"Yeah, yeah. And there's a story that goes that in order to get the best performance out of him,"
00:35:35,00:35:38,"Stan Laurel, who was really kind of the mastermind behind the two of them."
00:35:38,00:35:41,"He was the real thinker, the new comedy inside out."
00:35:41,00:35:43,He was a James Harkin of that group.
00:35:43,00:35:44,"Yeah, exactly."
00:35:44,00:35:45,He was a bossy.
00:35:45,00:35:47,"Yeah, bossy."
00:35:47,00:35:48,[laughter]
00:35:48,00:35:50,The kind of guys are pissed on some calls.
00:35:50,00:35:52,[laughter]
00:35:52,00:35:57,"So he used to get Hardy to do those frustrated looks into the camera at the end of the day,"
00:35:57,00:36:01,"because he knew that at the end of the day, Hardy wanted to get out of there and get on the golf course."
00:36:01,00:36:04,"He was like, ""I want to play golf,"" and he would keep him a bit."
00:36:04,00:36:05,He was a James Harkin.
00:36:05,00:36:06,[laughter]
00:36:06,00:36:07,Exactly.
00:36:07,00:36:13,"And so those frustrated looks were growingly real, because he was like, ""I'm meant to be out of here."""
00:36:13,00:36:18,I found some nice things about Stan that I really liked.
00:36:18,00:36:23,"Did you know that he, so he was doing hydroponic gardening that was one of his looks?"
00:36:23,00:36:24,"Oh, really?"
00:36:24,00:36:29,"And he once crossbred a potato and an onion, but couldn't get anyone to sample the results."
00:36:29,00:36:30,[laughter]
00:36:30,00:36:31,That was tragic.
00:36:31,00:36:33,"With his after, he was famous."
00:36:33,00:36:34,Yeah.
00:36:34,00:36:35,Wow.
00:36:35,00:36:36,Yeah.
00:36:36,00:36:37,I think it sounds a bit weird.
00:36:37,00:36:38,"Like, if you're making a hot pot, you only have to put one thing in."
00:36:38,00:36:39,Yes.
00:36:39,00:36:40,[laughter]
00:36:40,00:36:42,"Also, at times, Ava."
00:36:42,00:36:43,He was from the Lake District.
00:36:43,00:36:44,Yeah.
00:36:44,00:36:45,Didn't know that from all sorts of things.
00:36:45,00:36:46,"Oh, I read Overston."
00:36:46,00:36:47,Oh.
00:36:47,00:36:48,Is that so?
00:36:48,00:36:49,Yeah.
00:36:49,00:36:50,Very close by.
00:36:50,00:36:51,They both begin with you.
00:36:51,00:36:56,"Well, it's now home to what's described as the world's only Laurel and Hardy Museum."
00:36:56,00:36:57,It's really weird.
00:36:57,00:36:58,There's only one?
00:36:58,00:36:59,That is weird.
00:36:59,00:37:00,It's not weird.
00:37:00,00:37:01,Why is that not weird?
00:37:01,00:37:04,It's completely normal there's only one museum dedicated entirely to Laurel and Hardy.
00:37:04,00:37:06,"Okay, maybe there should be two."
00:37:06,00:37:07,Two tops.
00:37:07,00:37:08,Two tops.
00:37:08,00:37:09,Yeah.
00:37:09,00:37:13,I opened up a Laurel and Hardy cafe and ice cream bar in Kosovo back in 2003.
00:37:13,00:37:14,What?
00:37:14,00:37:15,What?
00:37:15,00:37:17,"So, I was going to say when we were describing here."
00:37:17,00:37:22,"So, I think I'm going to say, ""Lie, what are you going to say, honey?"""
00:37:22,00:37:23,I'm going with true.
00:37:23,00:37:24,I think it's true.
00:37:24,00:37:25,I think it's true.
00:37:25,00:37:26,I think it's like a double bluff.
00:37:26,00:37:27,I think it's true.
00:37:27,00:37:28,What the hell?
00:37:28,00:37:33,"Well, I was saying, and it wasn't my own money that was evolved, but I was living in Kosovo"
00:37:33,00:37:34,when I was 18.
00:37:34,00:37:38,Who wouldn't back that with being happy at all?
00:37:38,00:37:40,The dragons are all there.
00:37:40,00:37:44,They're fighting to get you.
00:37:44,00:37:45,Are we doing this Kosovo?
00:37:45,00:37:46,Kosovo.
00:37:46,00:37:51,"Don't I mean, it ends out with a chair shaking your hand."
00:37:51,00:37:52,"Yes, I'll take it."
00:37:52,00:37:53,Yes.
00:37:53,00:37:54,I'm in.
00:37:54,00:37:55,I'm all in.
00:37:55,00:38:00,There was a guy out there who I became friends with through my grandmother.
00:38:00,00:38:01,"And he was like, ""You like covenirs?"""
00:38:01,00:38:02,"I was like, ""Yeah."""
00:38:02,00:38:04,"And he was like, ""I'm opening a cafe and I want it to be themed."""
00:38:04,00:38:09,"And we spoke about it and we landed on the restaurant, would be the Hardy restaurant."
00:38:09,00:38:12,"And you would have the ice cream bar, which was Stan."
00:38:12,00:38:17,"And so it was all, you know, the images of them were up on the walls."
00:38:17,00:38:18,And you could buy statues.
00:38:18,00:38:20,But they were massive in Kosovo.
00:38:20,00:38:21,"Ice statues, of course."
00:38:21,00:38:22,Yeah.
00:38:22,00:38:24,I'm not hungry.
00:38:24,00:38:25,I have a big lunch.
00:38:25,00:38:31,"I'll just have a statue of Oliver Hardy, please."
00:38:31,00:38:32,Nine in the shot.
00:38:32,00:38:33,You didn't buy statues of the shot.
00:38:33,00:38:34,Would I be?
00:38:34,00:38:35,That'd be crazy.
00:38:35,00:38:36,Yeah.
00:38:36,00:38:37,We're just outside W going.
00:38:37,00:38:38,The next shot.
00:38:38,00:38:39,The next shot.
00:38:39,00:38:40,The next shot.
00:38:40,00:38:42,The wisdom was big in Albania.
00:38:42,00:38:44,I think you guys might know that they loved him there.
00:38:44,00:38:48,Oliver Hardy and Stan Laurel huge in that bit of the world as well.
00:38:48,00:38:49,Is it still trading?
00:38:49,00:38:50,I don't know.
00:38:50,00:38:51,I haven't been back for some.
00:38:51,00:38:52,I imagine it.
00:38:52,00:38:54,Can't come out of business.
00:38:54,00:38:59,There's our franchises in every city in the Balkans.
00:38:59,00:39:08,Okay.
00:39:08,00:39:09,It's time for our final fact of the show.
00:39:09,00:39:10,And that is James.
00:39:10,00:39:11,Okay.
00:39:11,00:39:17,My fact this week is that the character of Aunt Bessie was invented in 1994 to stop people mistaking
00:39:17,00:39:20,Yorkshire puddings for nuclear weapons.
00:39:20,00:39:22,Quick question.
00:39:22,00:39:23,Yeah.
00:39:23,00:39:24,Who's Aunt Bessie?
00:39:24,00:39:27,I can't believe that you don't know who Aunt Bessie is.
00:39:27,00:39:28,Educate the boy.
00:39:28,00:39:33,Aunt Bessie is a maternal figure who makes Yorkshire puddings.
00:39:33,00:39:35,She's like the patron saint of Hol.
00:39:35,00:39:36,Yeah.
00:39:36,00:39:37,Okay.
00:39:37,00:39:38,Yeah.
00:39:38,00:39:40,I can't believe she's not widely known.
00:39:40,00:39:41,Never heard of her.
00:39:41,00:39:43,"But she's not real, right?"
00:39:43,00:39:44,She's not real.
00:39:44,00:39:49,"No, she was invented in 1994 to stop people mistaking Yorkshire puddings for nuclear weapons."
00:39:49,00:39:50,Right.
00:39:50,00:39:55,"So up until that point, when you go to Sunday lunch and go, ""Whoa, everyone out, everyone out!"""
00:39:55,00:40:00,"Well, it's worse because when they were trying the nuclear tests off, they just threw a big"
00:40:00,00:40:01,Yorkshire puddings into it.
00:40:01,00:40:06,Like a lot of Hawaiian islands were destroyed by massive Yorkshire puddings being dropped
00:40:06,00:40:07,over.
00:40:07,00:40:12,"So, basically, this company that makes Yorkshire puddings was originally called Triton."
00:40:12,00:40:17,They're based in Hol and they did market research and found that people associated the name Triton
00:40:17,00:40:20,"with the UK's nuclear deterrent, which is Triton."
00:40:20,00:40:21,Yeah.
00:40:21,00:40:24,And only 4% of people associated the word with Yorkshire puddings.
00:40:24,00:40:29,So they decided to come up with a new brand and that new brand was Aunt Bessie.
00:40:29,00:40:30,Yeah.
00:40:30,00:40:34,"And they are the biggest makers of Yorkshire pudding, probably in the world, but definitely in Britain."
00:40:34,00:40:35,Yeah.
00:40:35,00:40:36,And they make millions of them.
00:40:36,00:40:40,They can't be anywhere outside Britain that makes more Yorkshire puddings than Britain.
00:40:40,00:40:41,Yeah.
00:40:41,00:40:44,"You know, sometimes you just find out, ""Oh, it happens that they're massive."""
00:40:44,00:40:45,Yeah.
00:40:45,00:40:46,It's like Kosovo.
00:40:46,00:40:47,There's this huge factory.
00:40:47,00:40:49,It's themed around Harold Lloyd.
00:40:49,00:40:50,And it's...
00:40:50,00:40:51,Yeah.
00:40:51,00:40:55,"Instead of custard pies, we use Yorkshire puddings in the restaurant."
00:40:55,00:40:56,Yeah.
00:40:56,00:41:00,Should we say what are Yorkshire puddings for international listeners?
00:41:00,00:41:01,Okay.
00:41:01,00:41:04,"For those of you not in Yorkshire or Bolivia, it is..."
00:41:04,00:41:08,"It's batter, so that's flour and water and eggs."
00:41:08,00:41:15,"And you get some hot oil and you make it really, really hot and then you put the batter into it"
00:41:15,00:41:20,and it puffs up into a delicious crispy thing that you eat with meat and gravy.
00:41:20,00:41:22,"You can have them as desserts as well, you know."
00:41:22,00:41:23,"Oh, yeah."
00:41:23,00:41:24,"Yeah, you can put ice cream in."
00:41:24,00:41:25,Have you done that?
00:41:25,00:41:26,"Yeah, it's really cool."
00:41:26,00:41:29,It's actually the best day ever.
00:41:29,00:41:34,"We had, we went for a roast dinner in London, actually, it wasn't even in the north."
00:41:34,00:41:39,"We had a Sunday lunch with huge Yorkshire puddings and then on the menu,"
00:41:39,00:41:43,you can get Yorkshire puddings with three scoops of ice cream in.
00:41:43,00:41:44,It was fantastic.
00:41:44,00:41:45,It was fantastic.
00:41:45,00:41:46,It's like a waffle.
00:41:46,00:41:47,"It's like a pancake, isn't it, really?"
00:41:47,00:41:49,"It feels decadent that sort of, you know."
00:41:49,00:41:52,Because is that still made with beef dripping?
00:41:52,00:41:54,Are you adding ice cream to beef dripping?
00:41:54,00:41:55,"I presume so, yes."
00:41:55,00:42:01,I've got to say that is a step two northern for me.
00:42:01,00:42:05,Have you been to the factory that makes them?
00:42:05,00:42:07,I've driven past it a million times.
00:42:07,00:42:08,I've never been there.
00:42:08,00:42:09,"Oh, interesting."
00:42:09,00:42:11,This is an interesting question for you.
00:42:11,00:42:15,"People who work there, some of them have reported that as they drive past,"
00:42:15,00:42:20,"even if they work in a different industry, they feel the call of the factory to work there."
00:42:20,00:42:21,Wow.
00:42:21,00:42:22,What are you talking about?
00:42:22,00:42:27,"So the factories Yorkshire pudding guru, as he's known, David Barr,"
00:42:27,00:42:28,that's how he ended up working there.
00:42:28,00:42:29,He used to work in fish.
00:42:29,00:42:33,"He was always in the fish industry and he used to pass it every day and he thought,"
00:42:33,00:42:35,"""Oh, I feel I need to be in there."""
00:42:35,00:42:38,And he applied three times for the job.
00:42:38,00:42:42,What's that movie where they sort of make the spaceship out of mashed potatoes?
00:42:42,00:42:43,Close and close to the...
00:42:43,00:42:46,This is like the Yorkshire version of that.
00:42:46,00:42:47,"Yeah, exactly."
00:42:47,00:42:48,Yeah.
00:42:48,00:42:51,"No, he felt the calling and he went for three interviews and he failed the first two."
00:42:51,00:42:56,"And he said, finally, he got the job when they just asked him why he wanted to join the company"
00:42:56,00:42:58,"and he went, ""I just love Yorkshire puddings."""
00:42:58,00:42:59,"And they're like, ""You're in."""
00:42:59,00:43:01,And he's now literally the top of the heap.
00:43:01,00:43:02,He is the man.
00:43:02,00:43:03,He's the guru.
00:43:03,00:43:04,He's his title there.
00:43:04,00:43:06,Is that Willy Wonka of Yorkshire pudding?
00:43:06,00:43:07,"Yeah, exactly."
00:43:07,00:43:08,That's a good film.
00:43:08,00:43:10,"I mean, it's pretty crazy, isn't it?"
00:43:10,00:43:12,"Like, the amount that they produce."
00:43:12,00:43:17,"Every day, they use more than half a million eggs in order to make..."
00:43:17,00:43:22,This is in the Christmas season where it really ramps up and they have to bring in more staff
00:43:22,00:43:23,of all felt the calling.
00:43:23,00:43:25,It's a pretty incredible process.
00:43:25,00:43:26,It's like a wonderland.
00:43:26,00:43:29,And what do you think do you toss?
00:43:29,00:43:32,"Like, visitors can go because I would genuinely be interested in going."
00:43:32,00:43:34,I'm sure your career has allowed you now.
00:43:34,00:43:35,Do you think?
00:43:35,00:43:37,Do you think I've got the key to the factory?
00:43:37,00:43:38,You've got the poll.
00:43:38,00:43:41,What's the point of getting all these awards?
00:43:41,00:43:45,"And all these amazing podcasts, if you can't then get into the Yorkshire pudding party."
00:43:45,00:43:48,You've got a whole second greatest comedy double act.
00:43:48,00:43:51,Of course you're getting it.
00:43:51,00:43:54,"I'm sorry, Hailey and Pace are geniuses."
00:43:54,00:43:55,And they from Hull.
00:43:55,00:43:57,"Gareth Hailey is from Hull, yeah."
00:43:57,00:43:58,"Yeah, yeah."
00:43:58,00:43:59,Born and raised.
00:43:59,00:44:00,What if he's been to the factory?
00:44:00,00:44:01,Of course he has.
00:44:01,00:44:02,He's got a key.
00:44:02,00:44:03,He's got a key.
00:44:03,00:44:04,He's got a key.
00:44:04,00:44:05,He's got a key.
00:44:05,00:44:06,He's probably shagged out.
00:44:06,00:44:07,"Bessie, he's..."
00:44:07,00:44:08,Wow.
00:44:08,00:44:10,Can I ask you something about Hull?
00:44:10,00:44:11,"Yes, please."
00:44:11,00:44:16,Hull got listed as part of Lonely Planets 500 travel experiences in the UK.
00:44:16,00:44:19,Unmissable experiences and hidden plans.
00:44:19,00:44:22,You made one entry in the 500.
00:44:22,00:44:24,You were listed 483.
00:44:24,00:44:26,And it was a public toilet.
00:44:26,00:44:27,No.
00:44:27,00:44:28,Yeah.
00:44:28,00:44:29,What's the experience to have?
00:44:29,00:44:30,It's secret.
00:44:30,00:44:35,It was Victoria Peer's public toilet.
00:44:35,00:44:36,Have you been?
00:44:36,00:44:37,Yeah.
00:44:37,00:44:38,Is it good?
00:44:38,00:44:39,No.
00:44:39,00:44:40,But is it historical?
00:44:40,00:44:43,"Yeah, it's kind of beautiful, but the outside."
00:44:43,00:44:46,"But if you actually use the toilet itself, you're harrowing."
00:44:46,00:44:48,You're not going to be pissing in the sauna.
00:44:48,00:44:49,I don't think it is.
00:44:49,00:44:53,"If you had a genuinely fair choice, would 100% go for the sauna?"
00:44:53,00:44:55,At least then you're in a sauna.
00:44:55,00:44:56,Yeah.
00:44:56,00:45:00,"It's actually a good way of getting rid of human excruence, isn't it, in a way?"
00:45:00,00:45:01,A sauna.
00:45:01,00:45:04,"Yeah, like it means you don't have to have drains or anything,"
00:45:04,00:45:06,because it just evaporates.
00:45:06,00:45:07,You breathe it all in.
00:45:07,00:45:08,You breathe in that piss.
00:45:08,00:45:09,That's what I'm saying.
00:45:09,00:45:10,"But it's number one, sadly."
00:45:10,00:45:11,Yeah.
00:45:11,00:45:12,"It's number one, sadly."
00:45:12,00:45:17,We're going to have to update that sign.
00:45:17,00:45:19,That sign.
00:45:19,00:45:24,"Imagine the disdain of the person writing, ""Oh, shit."""
00:45:24,00:45:27,"Don't baby right, or ejaculate."
00:45:27,00:45:28,You taxi drivers.
00:45:28,00:45:29,We're one of you taxi drivers.
00:45:29,00:45:30,We're one of you taxi drivers.
00:45:30,00:45:31,We're one of you taxi drivers.
00:45:31,00:45:32,We're one of you taxi drivers.
00:45:32,00:45:33,We're one of you taxi drivers.
00:45:33,00:45:34,We're one of you taxi drivers.
00:45:34,00:45:35,We're one of you taxi drivers.
00:45:35,00:45:36,Oh my god.
00:45:36,00:45:38,Oh my god.
00:45:38,00:45:39,Hold patty.
00:45:39,00:45:40,Patty butty.
00:45:40,00:45:41,Yeah.
00:45:41,00:45:42,You've got a red one.
00:45:42,00:45:43,"No, I never have."
00:45:43,00:45:44,What's a patty butty?
00:45:44,00:45:45,What?
00:45:45,00:45:47,You don't know what a patty butty is.
00:45:47,00:45:48,I like the shirt.
00:45:48,00:45:51,I like how that hollets the wrong end of the M62.
00:45:51,00:45:54,"If you end up there, you've gone seriously wrong."
00:45:54,00:45:56,"Yeah, you've really gone wrong there."
00:45:56,00:45:59,So a patty is a potato.
00:45:59,00:46:05,It's like mashed potato with lovely herbs in deep fries.
00:46:05,00:46:07,Deep fried to make it sort of like a...
00:46:07,00:46:09,It's almost like a potato fritter.
00:46:09,00:46:10,Yeah.
00:46:10,00:46:14,But then you have it in a breadcake or a bread bun or however you want to say that.
00:46:14,00:46:17,And you pack vinegar onto it till it's dripping.
00:46:17,00:46:18,And it's fantastic.
00:46:18,00:46:19,That sounds good.
00:46:19,00:46:20,That sounds good.
00:46:20,00:46:21,"Oh, it's so good."
00:46:21,00:46:22,It's a really traditional hull dish.
00:46:22,00:46:23,Yeah.
00:46:23,00:46:25,It's traditionally made by the maidens of hull.
00:46:25,00:46:26,By hand.
00:46:26,00:46:30,Did they roll it on their thighs like the Cubans are girls.
00:46:30,00:46:31,Yeah.
00:46:31,00:46:35,Just wipe the oil off on your thighs.
00:46:35,00:46:36,Oh my God.
00:46:36,00:46:38,It's very hard to tell sometimes if you're in hull or hervana.
00:46:38,00:46:42,"But if you smell the vinegar, that's what you know."
00:46:42,00:46:45,You know your flirting's gone well where you can smell the vinegar.
00:46:45,00:46:48,I'm not a hull maiden.
00:46:48,00:46:53,But there was this whole group of women and they were called patty slappers.
00:46:53,00:46:54,No.
00:46:54,00:46:55,Wow.
00:46:55,00:46:56,That was a drop.
00:46:56,00:46:58,"I just wondered, is that known in hull?"
00:46:58,00:46:59,I didn't know that.
00:46:59,00:47:02,I just got a new idea for a show.
00:47:02,00:47:05,Wow.
00:47:05,00:47:07,That's incredible.
00:47:07,00:47:09,You've got the lemsip factory.
00:47:09,00:47:10,We've got the lemsip factory.
00:47:10,00:47:11,Really.
00:47:11,00:47:12,Isn't that cool?
00:47:12,00:47:13,I don't know.
00:47:13,00:47:14,I owe a great deal.
00:47:14,00:47:15,I owe a great deal.
00:47:15,00:47:16,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:47:16,00:47:17,Racket.
00:47:17,00:47:18,Is the firm on it?
00:47:18,00:47:19,Yeah.
00:47:19,00:47:20,That's very cool.
00:47:20,00:47:23,"Actually, there's quite a fun thing which was this team called the drunk animal creative studio."
00:47:23,00:47:28,Set up these things of alternative blue plaques to commemorate the locals had done interesting things.
00:47:28,00:47:29,Have you seen those?
00:47:29,00:47:32,"I think I've, yeah, I think I've heard of it."
00:47:32,00:47:33,But I don't know.
00:47:33,00:47:34,I don't know if I've seen any.
00:47:34,00:47:41,"So like an example would be on this spot last Monday, Tom Piper got lucky."
00:47:41,00:47:42,That was one.
00:47:42,00:47:43,Yeah.
00:47:43,00:47:44,Here was one.
00:47:44,00:47:50,"Ronnie Pickering, 2015, became an internet sensation near here for his red citron Picasso."
00:47:50,00:47:51,"The citron hull, really Pickering."
00:47:51,00:47:52,"Yeah, he's from home."
00:47:52,00:47:53,Yeah.
00:47:53,00:47:54,That's amazing.
00:47:54,00:47:55,That's a bit.
00:47:55,00:47:56,"You know Ronnie Pickering, but you don't know."
00:47:56,00:47:58,- This is wild. (laughing)
00:47:58,00:48:00,- It's not best if you maybe threaten someone from a car.
00:48:00,00:48:02,Maybe I wonder what I'm gonna do.
00:48:02,00:48:06,- I'm not a fucking bestie. (laughing)
00:48:06,00:48:10,"- Beep, beep, beep. (laughing)"
00:48:10,00:48:14,"- Oh, good. - And that's so cool."
00:48:14,00:48:16,"- Yeah, they're really fun. - It's lovely."
00:48:16,00:48:18,- There's a really cool hero as well called Carl Buschby.
00:48:18,00:48:20,Have you heard of him from Hall?
00:48:20,00:48:23,"He decided in 1998 he was gonna walk the world, right?"
00:48:23,00:48:26,So he started in Chile and the idea was to end up
00:48:26,00:48:27,back in Hall.
00:48:27,00:48:29,So it was gonna take him 10 years.
00:48:29,00:48:31,So he should have been back in 2010.
00:48:31,00:48:33,- He's still walking. - Did he?
00:48:33,00:48:34,"- Yeah, why? - Did he not realize"
00:48:34,00:48:36,that the Atlantic Ocean is in between those two places?
00:48:36,00:48:39,"- Yeah, yeah, it's a bit of a problem."
00:48:39,00:48:41,"- There must be a land bridge here, something."
00:48:41,00:48:42,(laughing)
00:48:42,00:48:43,- He had so many problems.
00:48:43,00:48:47,He's expected to end it in September of next year.
00:48:47,00:48:49,He's still walking. - Do we know where he is?
00:48:49,00:48:51,- He was just walking through Turkey
00:48:51,00:48:53,and I think he's just crossed the border now.
00:48:53,00:48:54,So that's good. - That's good.
00:48:54,00:48:57,"- I mean, it's been really hard because you had to have,"
00:48:57,00:48:59,"you know, three month of eases were a problem"
00:48:59,00:49:01,when you were walking Russia.
00:49:01,00:49:02,"You know, like that wasn't it?"
00:49:02,00:49:04,"- I'll tell you what, if he's coming up from Turkey,"
00:49:04,00:49:06,you know where he's about to go past.
00:49:06,00:49:08,- Wow. - Kosovo.
00:49:08,00:49:10,"- You've got Carl, Carl, you've got to go."
00:49:10,00:49:11,"- Carl, use your coach, driver,"
00:49:11,00:49:14,and you'll get yourself a pretty statue.
00:49:14,00:49:15,(laughing)
00:49:15,00:49:17,"Stan, not Ollie."
00:49:17,00:49:20,(laughing)
00:49:20,00:49:23,(upbeat music)
00:49:24,00:49:27,"- Okay, that's it, that is all of our facts."
00:49:27,00:49:28,Thank you so much for listening.
