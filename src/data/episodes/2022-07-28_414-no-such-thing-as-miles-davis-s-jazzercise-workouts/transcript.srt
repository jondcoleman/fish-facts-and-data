00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,600
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast, this

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,000
 week coming to you live from Siddleburn!

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 [applause]

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 My name is Dan Shriver, I am sitting here with Anna Toshinsky, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 and once again we have gathered round the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 and in no particular order here we go, starting with fact number one and that is Anna.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 My fact this week is that in the 19th century you could be rejected from the army for having bad breath.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Wow. Why? Why? Let's...

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 The justification is really no more complicated than you think, which is that it's fucking gross for everyone else.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 I can imagine like if you're in a submarine or something.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 If you have to give another sort of the kiss of life, but you accidentally send them into the arms of death.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 I don't think the kiss of life had been invented yet even. This is from a book written in 1840

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 which I don't know why I was reading it but it's called Hints on the Medical Examination of Recruits for the Army

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 and there's some great stuff in there and the thing I read was some recruits are so offensive in their breath

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 as to be intolerable to their mess mates and from these causes are discharged from the French service

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 and ought to be from every other.

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Wow. This book is really good. It's great fun. So I highly recommend it because it's talking about how you examine people for the army

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 and there are lots of reasons for rejecting people, unsound health, fair enough, scrawfielder, loss of teeth, flat feet.

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 You had to be inspected sober and naked by the recruiting doctor.

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 How are they going to get you naked if you're sober?

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Great point.

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 They also, large testicles, you're out. You're not allowed in the army.

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Oh really? Why is that?

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Any remarkable...

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 Why is it too big a shot like if they're aiming for you?

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 Why was the reason for two big balls?

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Any remarkable enlargement or induration of the testicle is a cause of rejection.

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 I bet that so many people claim that was why they got rejected. Everyone says it.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Everyone's leaning away from their breath. Actually it was the testicle that meant I didn't get it.

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 I think they're talking about sort of hydroceals or conditions where you have it but they really do get very big indeed.

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Yeah, well also you get turned away for having a narrow chest or for relaxed abdominal rings.

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Which I think might just mean you'd die a year.

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 I don't know. For me that was like having like a belly, like what do you call them, like love handles kind of thing.

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Oh, that makes a lot of sense.

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 That makes more sense. Imagine that inspection if it's up the anus.

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 No, sorry mate.

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Your abdominal rings are...

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Not tense enough for me.

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 Okay.

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 Cranky.

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 I've never said that before.

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 If anything that would make me more tense.

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 Oh, there was also, so when it was talking about how to, because you get turned away for being a habitual drunk.

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 And so the book gives information on how to spot a habitual drunk.

46
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 And it says you can sense it on their breath, so that's another reason why bad breathing might get rejected for it.

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 Because if you can smell old alcohol on their breath.

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 And also look out for grog blossoms.

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Do you know what they are?

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 I think they're like spots on your nose or something.

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 Sort of like a flush.

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 A general that ruddy flush that you get.

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Basically it's burst blood vessels.

54
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 Yeah, you're skirting around it.

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 Yeah, isn't that because you know, if you're an alcoholic, you've got burst blood vessels all over your face.

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 I like grog blossoms.

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Yeah, it's cool.

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 It was in the news quite recently that too many people were getting turned away from the British army.

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 And it was like, oh, this is the end of the world. This is going to happen.

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 There was a guy in Leeds called Jack 17. We don't know his surname.

61
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 And he said that he didn't get in because he had acne.

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 He said there was two things. He had acne and cold hands and feet on the day of the test.

63
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 And he said, well, I've had acne before and it literally just clears up within a day or so.

64
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 And also it's snowing outside.

65
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Right.

66
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 But they were having none of it and they wouldn't let him in.

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 Yeah, but it hasn't put him off. He's going to reapply when his acne goes.

68
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 It's the summer, maybe.

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 Yeah, exactly.

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 But why, the enemy is not going to shoot at you more if you've got acne.

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 Well, this was a weird thing.

72
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 They found that there were so many medical conditions that they were turning away that as a result,

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 they were really understaffed for new recruits for the army.

74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 So they had a target of 82,000 people and they fell short 5,000 because people would be turned away for acne.

75
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 They were being turned away because, you know, someone had a nut allergy, which, you know, apparently that's important.

76
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 If you're going to go and seize that nut factory from the enemy, then that's the problem, isn't it?

77
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 Well, I guess it makes it easier. Yeah, if you're allergic to nuts, you know, if Bond was allergic to nuts, it's way easier to kill him, right?

78
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 Do you think what you would do is tie him down on a table and just throw peanuts closer and closer to him?

79
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 Yes.

80
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 So they land him in his nuts.

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 And that's the cause. It's an airborne nut allergy, in which case you just need to leave a packet of peanuts slowly being opened by a machine.

82
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 And that's the thing. Then he's got to get out before the packet of nuts.

83
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 So I will watch all of these all of these scenarios happen.

84
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 He said and the reason that this guy in the news is because nut allergies can be very, really, really dangerous.

85
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 But he had a nut allergy that he didn't need an EpiPen for and hadn't had any reaction for over 10 years.

86
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 Yeah.

87
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 So that was the thing about that.

88
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 Yeah.

89
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 There was, you guys may well have come across this in your research in 2020.

90
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 There was a potential recruit who was rejected from the army for having a tattoo.

91
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 And the problem is that once you apply to the army, if you say you have tattoos, they ask you to send in photos of the tattoos.

92
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 And he had a six inch tattoo of a penis on him and they said that's no good.

93
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 We're not allowed that.

94
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 How realistic was this tattoo?

95
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 It was extremely realistic.

96
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 But couldn't you not have just said this is my actual penis?

97
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 Yeah.

98
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 It was in the uncanny valley between looking too much like a penis to be comfortable with, but not so much like a penis that you think of that.

99
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 But you feel nice and comfortable.

100
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 Exactly. Thank you.

101
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 Was he turned away?

102
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 He was turned away.

103
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 He was turned away.

104
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 Thank you for your interest, but we can't take you into the army.

105
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 So the rules are very strict on any tattoos which have kind of, you know, sexual meanings or offensive meanings or potentially offensive meanings.

106
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 Where was it?

107
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 It was, well, that's the thing which I think is slightly unfair.

108
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 It was on his inner thigh.

109
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 So it wasn't in the wrong place.

110
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 Was it to remind him where to leave it?

111
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 Like a parking spot.

112
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 It was a very roomy parking spot.

113
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 It really was.

114
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 It's quite, like, it's...

115
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 Why would you do a big one? You've got the comparison right there.

116
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 Do a tiny, tiny penis?

117
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 Well, because you can see it right.

118
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 It's cold. Here's what it usually looks like.

119
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 It's a perfect alibi.

120
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 Oh, it's staying on my leg again from my penis earlier in the day in a hot room.

121
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 It's not even once, like, trying to get into being rejected from the army before you get into it.

122
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 There's a story I read which is of someone who was in the army who they were desperately trying to get out through loopholes.

123
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 And this was Timothy Leary who was, you know, LSD.

124
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 He was one of the big gurus.

125
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 He was a counterculture character in America.

126
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 And he was part of the Armed Forces in America.

127
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 And he kind of did a lot of pranks and he exposed some of the generals to weird things that embarrassed them.

128
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 So they desperately tried to get him out.

129
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 So he was shaving once and he cut himself and they tried to get him out on the grounds that he damaged military property.

130
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 And was he the property himself?

131
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 Yes, because when you're apart, and this was back in the 50s and 60s, when you sign up to the military, you sign your body over, you are the military.

132
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 So that was damaged to their property when he cut himself.

133
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 What if you cut your nails?

134
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 Well, they were trying to get him out so they were loop-holing it.

135
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 I know, but it sounds like, did it work?

136
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 He stayed in. He managed to, he managed to stay in, but they desperately tried all these things.

137
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 Another group of people who wanted people to leave the army or leave the British army was the Nazis.

138
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 And so they decided that they would drop a load of leaflets on the Allied forces to give them tricks of how to get kicked out of the army.

139
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 And the thing said, oh, you've done a really good job, but now's the time to, you know, give up because you're going to lose anyway.

140
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 So this is the best way to get out of the army.

141
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 So they had these little pamphlets.

142
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 One of them advised men to fake heart disease by smoking 20 to 30 cigarettes per day.

143
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 And it said, if you normally smoke that much already, why not double the number?

144
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 There was an interview in Vice Arabia, which interviewed people who'd successfully exempted themselves from the army and found ways of doing it.

145
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 And one guy said he just spent months and months completely gorging constantly.

146
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 So every meal he'd eat, burgers, pizzas, pastries, he said, I added mayonnaise to everything I ate.

147
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 And then I would have mayonnaise as its own snack between meals.

148
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 He gained five stone in six months.

149
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 That's amazing. Mayonnaise is a snack.

150
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 Yeah, delicious. I know. Probably he wasn't doing it already.

151
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 We're going to have to move on very soon to our next fact since it's gone so quick.

152
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 Just quickly on bad breath and halitosis, the phrase, often a bridesmaid never a bride, that comes from listerine.

153
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 And it was to do with bad breath.

154
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 Yeah, so these were adverts in America where they would have wording like Edna's case was a really pathetic one.

155
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 Like every woman, her primary ambition was to marry.

156
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 Most of the girls of her set were married or about to be, yet no one possessed more grace or charm or loveliness than she.

157
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 As her birthdays crept towards the tragic 30 mark, marriage seemed farther from her life than ever.

158
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 She was often a bridesmaid, but never a bride.

159
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 And that popularized that phrase and that's why we use it.

160
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 Their adverts are unbelievable examples in basically negging your audience.

161
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 So they're all things like he never knew why and it shows someone being socially shunned or they say it behind your back.

162
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 Or, my favourite one, are you unpopular with your own children?

163
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 I know you think it's because your balls are too big, but I'm promising you got a halitosis.

164
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is James.

165
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 Okay, my fact this week is that in 1888 there was a squatting competition in India.

166
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 Despite being up against the country's best wrestlers, the winner was a ten-year-old boy who managed several thousand squats but was then bedridden for a week.

167
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 So cool.

168
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 So this is the exercise, the squats basically.

169
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 And this is a young boy who later became a wrestler and he was known as the Great Gama and he's one of the most famous wrestlers from Indian history.

170
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 In the time there was loads of Maharajas and stuff like that and there was this guy called the Maharajra Jodpa and he decided that he wanted to find the greatest squatter in the whole of the land.

171
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 And they got all these wrestlers in to see who could do it best.

172
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 And this guy who was his original name was Ghulam Muhammad Baksh but he was coming from a really kind of a wrestling dynasty and his father had died quite young.

173
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 And they decided this young boy was going to be the greatest wrestler in the whole world and we're going to do it even at the age of ten.

174
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 He's going to do loads and loads of squats, loads of push-ups, everything.

175
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 And at the age of ten he managed to beat all of these wrestlers in the whole country.

176
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 To be fair, you've got less distance to cover if you're ten and squatting.

177
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 I would say that every squat should count for half a squat.

178
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 Oh wow.

179
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 That would be the rule that I imposed, right? It's much easier to go up.

180
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 You haven't been through puberty so you've got less muscle mass so it's harder.

181
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 I think Hannah's a bit right because you know like on Britain's gone talent when the kids win but they're actually a bit shit compared to the adults.

182
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 To be fair to him, yes he was a kid so maybe he had an advantage but this guy...

183
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 If he didn't have an advantage, I didn't mean that seriously.

184
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 I'm not slamming him just in case someone's alive who's descended from Gama and they are.

185
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 He didn't have an advantage.

186
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 Okay, cool.

187
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 Don't try to Hannah down and squat on her.

188
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 But how do you feel about the tightness of these rings?

189
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 This guy went on to be one of the greatest wrestling champions of all time.

190
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 That was like watching when you watch a Superman movie and Superman discovers...

191
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 He effectively became world champion.

192
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 Everyone called him the world champion.

193
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 They didn't have proper championships in those days but they called him the world champion.

194
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 By the time he was an adult we got a picture of him here.

195
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 He had 30 inch thighs and 56 inch chest.

196
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Just to put that into context, there was a guy called Roberto Carlos who some of you might know

197
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 a soccer player who had famously massive thighs.

198
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 His were 24 inches compared to 30 inch for Gama.

199
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 His inch was 56 inches and Arnold Schwarzenegger's chest was 42 inches.

200
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 That's how big this guy was.

201
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 Gosh, his diet, the training sounds incredible.

202
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 His daily diet included 6 pounds of butter, 10 litres of milk,

203
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 half a litre of ghee which is basically clarified butter.

204
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 A few snacks of mayonnaise.

205
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 And one sachet of Hellman's mayonnaise every day.

206
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 He did 3,000 press-ups a day and had 40 wrestling belts against other people.

207
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 And 5,000 squats a day.

208
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 I didn't think it was essential to making a world champion

209
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 but I tried some today just to feel what it's like.

210
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 It's hard to squat, yes?

211
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 Like after the first three, it's really...

212
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 Well, thank you, Joe Wicks.

213
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 We don't know exactly how many he did actually.

214
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 We have his work for it, they did 5,000.

215
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 We know it was very, very high but we don't know exactly how much it was

216
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 and that's because no one ever saw him start a routine and then the routine

217
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 because no one stayed in the gym for as long as he did.

218
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 That's brilliant.

219
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 Very boring spectators for watching someone squat to be fair.

220
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 I did think that with the squats that if you were doing a competition

221
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 and watching how many squats are going on, how do you monitor each individual?

222
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 Like do you have like a little bell at the bottom?

223
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 There should be an angle you have to hit, shouldn't there?

224
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 It was basically time.

225
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 Oh, so we just continued the squats.

226
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 And they asked him how many he did.

227
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 They're pretty certain it was over 2,000.

228
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 He said he'd done thousands but had lost count

229
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 but they knew that it was over 2,000.

230
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 So it's a modern record of consecutive squats, about 3,200.

231
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 So it's not completely out of the question number.

232
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 It's kind of a reasonable number.

233
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 Have you ever asked a 10-year-old how many times did you just run around the garden?

234
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 Oh, a million.

235
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 Yeah, okay, we'll write that down in the history books.

236
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 I've already got it in for the child stars and child afterings today.

237
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 He never chose a word.

238
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 I also don't chose a word of his diet.

239
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 I don't think there are any legends that build up around these people.

240
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 The details of his diet are just implausible.

241
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 You'd have a heart attack.

242
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 He was consuming like 50,000 calories a day as far as the legend is concerned.

243
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 You wouldn't have time to do anything else.

244
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 I'm not calling him a liar, I'm calling his press team liars.

245
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 I kind of agree with you.

246
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 I think this whole period of entertainment from magicians

247
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 through to these strong men acts and stuff like that,

248
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 it's a period where there is no truth, I feel.

249
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 Well, that's plausible. You are going to love this next one.

250
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 This is a more recent report, actually.

251
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 This is a report from the Telegraph a few years ago, I think it was in 2011.

252
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 This is about someone who could do one-finger push-ups, okay?

253
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 So it's an athlete called Qi Guizhong from China who holds,

254
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 and I'm quoting directly here,

255
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 holds the record for the most one-finger push-ups in 30 seconds.

256
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 He did 41 one-finger push-ups in 30 seconds, set that in December 2011.

257
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 I'm still quoting, "The power of Guizhong's finger is so strong,

258
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 "he is said to be able to kill a man just by pointing at them."

259
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 Yes!

260
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 Oh, wow.

261
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 That's amazing.

262
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 What do you think was that?

263
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 That was in the Telegraph.

264
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 I just love the idea of him, you know, he's trying to pick teams in football.

265
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 You? Oh, shit. Oh, no.

266
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 You know, birds do press-ups before they fly. Baby birds.

267
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 Really? How sweet is that? That's amazing.

268
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 Is that to get their muscles better? Is that really?

269
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 Exactly. They have this puppy fat when they're young,

270
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 and before they fly, they have to have enough strength.

271
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 Obviously, you can't just try flying, especially if you're leaving a high nest.

272
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 And swifts have been observed. They do these press-ups

273
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 where they push and extend their wings,

274
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 and they rest on the wingtips for up to nine seconds.

275
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 Wow.

276
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 I mean, almost all animals don't do exercise.

277
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 No, hasn't caught on.

278
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 No, but that's because animals don't have to do exercise normally,

279
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 because muscle changes get triggered by not exercising most animals.

280
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 So, like, bears, it gets triggered by seasonal changes, the weather changes,

281
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 and then it just releases muscle-forming compounds into their bloodstream,

282
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 and then they get fit. That would be useful.

283
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 Really? It's incredible. Yeah, humans do not have this skill.

284
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 Wow. But scientists try to...

285
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 Just like if every, you know, every April just you'd walked into the office

286
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 and everyone's buffers happen.

287
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 Exactly. It's so good.

288
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 It's so unfair that we don't have this.

289
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 Morning. Good morning.

290
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 Someone comes in still really skinny and forgot to hibernate.

291
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 Can't believe it.

292
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 Baby birds do do that.

293
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 But birds do that even before they're babies.

294
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 They exercise in the egg. They exercise if you can say it.

295
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 No, no, come on. Really? That's incredible.

296
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 This is true. So, these are baby birds who are parasitic birds.

297
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 You know, like cockles, for instance.

298
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 They lay an egg in another bird's nest,

299
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 and then their baby will come out,

300
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 and often they'll attack the other birds.

301
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 And they found some parasitic birds

302
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 who will do exercises inside the eggs

303
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 so that when they hatch, they're already hench as fuck

304
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 so they can beat up all the other birds.

305
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 Isn't that amazing?

306
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 That's so funny.

307
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 Going back to Gama for a second,

308
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 there's a really cool thing where there's a museum that you can go to

309
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 that has a giant rock that he once lifted,

310
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 and it's so heavy that they were like,

311
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 "That needs to go in a museum."

312
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 So it's 1,200 kilograms heavy.

313
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 Well, he never lifted that.

314
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 So, I mean, like, he might have been said to have lifted it,

315
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 but no one's ever lifted more than 600 or 700 kilos.

316
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 As far as we know.

317
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 Pick Andy up on the old pointing fingers attack.

318
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 Well, I'm saying he's picked up a rock.

319
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 Okay, I think that never happened either.

320
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 That's about as heavy as a bull, right?

321
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 Or like a big bull, or a quite small hippo, I think.

322
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 Yeah, maybe.

323
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 But smaller in size, right?

324
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 Like, it's harder to pick up a hippo.

325
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 Sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

326
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 Unless you go underneath it and sort of lift it up.

327
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 It fights back, though, which rocks don't.

328
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 I think that's often why they use weights

329
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 rather than hippos in these contexts.

330
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 You know that when you've done exercise

331
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 and you have muscle and then you don't exercise for a while

332
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 and you lose the muscle.

333
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 Atrophies. Atrophies, yeah.

334
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 That is an evolutionary aid. We're designed to do that.

335
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 It's a good thing, really, yeah.

336
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 This is because kilos of muscle are really expensive to maintain.

337
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 And you are about 40% muscle on average.

338
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 And so it's a lot of your energy.

339
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 It's about a fifth of your basic energy budget.

340
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 It just goes on keeping your muscles going.

341
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 So actually, it's an advantage that you don't keep the muscle

342
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 when you stop exercising. It doesn't feel like it.

343
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 It would be very nice if you just kept it forever.

344
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 I'm having a real flashback on your behalf

345
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 after you being 14 at school

346
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 and explaining this to the seven bullies around you.

347
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 Guys, you're actually very inefficiently big.

348
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 Do you know Zumba? We were talking about exercise.

349
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 Zumba used to be called a rumba size.

350
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 Can you think of where the word rumba size comes from?

351
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 It's two words together.

352
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 Is there a dance called the rumba? The rumba, yeah.

353
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 Exercise. No, no, no. It comes from a mixture of rumba and jazzercise.

354
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 Of course.

355
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 Jazzercise, I find really interesting.

356
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 So jazzercise was started by a woman called Judy Sheppard-Missett in 1969.

357
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 And basically she did it just as a warm-up to start off with.

358
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 And everyone loved it.

359
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 And soon it was all over the country in the US

360
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 and then eventually all over the world. Absolutely huge.

361
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 She decided she wanted to turn it into a thing.

362
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 So she went to her bank and she said,

363
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 "Can you give me some money to kind of set up this jazzercise thing?"

364
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 And the bank looked at the numbers and they said,

365
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 "No, this is just a fad. It's a complete waste of time."

366
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 And then she said, "Seven years later, that bank went out of business.

367
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 "Fifty years later, she was still working."

368
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 Isn't that cool?

369
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 I don't know what the hell jazzercise is,

370
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 so I don't know who these hordes of people are who are doing it.

371
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 I would have thought it was incredibly difficult to exercise jazz music.

372
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 If there's one genre of music I'm not exercising to,

373
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 it's Miles Davis crudely laying.

374
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 I'll be honest, it's more just jazzy than jazz.

375
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 Probably more trap jazz than like a 12-minute bassoon solo.

376
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 We're going to have to move on in a sec to our next fact.

377
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 Can I tell you my favourite squat terminology that I learned?

378
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 It's Finnish and it's slang used in Finland, and it's squat wine.

379
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 Squat wine. Life has a drink wine.

380
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 So squat wine is a wine that is so cheap that they keep it on the lowest shelves of a supermarket.

381
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 You need a squat to get down to read the labels.

382
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 That's so good.

383
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

384
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 My fact is, there was a breed of dogs in Victorian times

385
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 which only existed in taxidermy form.

386
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 The perfect pet.

387
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 It's quite weird, isn't it, because how do you stuff something that doesn't exist?

388
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 Well, exactly.

389
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 So this is from an exhibit at the Horniman Museum in south London, which is a great museum.

390
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 They've got lots of stuff, and lots of stuffing.

391
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 They've got lots of stuff things.

392
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 And they've got these dogs, which they look like dogs, but they're not proper dogs.

393
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 So they're dog skin.

394
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 Basically, the Victorians loved tiny dogs.

395
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 Guys, just tune out for a while. I'll come back.

396
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 What we know up here, because we've had to read about this fact, is that Andy's trying to describe something quite gruesome.

397
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 It's quite charming. They took still their puppies, and they loved miniature dogs, and they loved incredibly tiny toy dogs,

398
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 but there are dogs which don't exist in this smaller form in their actual life.

399
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 So they would take puppies that had not been born alive, would arrange those into the shape and sort of situation of proper adult dogs,

400
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 but looking tiny, they called them Roman dogs or dwarf dogs, and they were kind of fashionable things to have.

401
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 So basically, it's an incredibly tiny, great dane in a glass case.

402
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 But the thing is that actually, they kind of convinced people that they were real kind of lilliputian, you know, St. Bernard's or whatever, didn't they?

403
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 They were like, it's normally a big dog, this is a real tiny one, you can buy it for thousands of pounds.

404
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 And people did buy it for thousands of pounds, not knowing that they had this kind of trick.

405
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 It's like the micro pig craze from about ten years ago.

406
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 Well, when people accidentally just bought normal pigs that were piglets.

407
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 Yeah, so it is pretty gruesome, but it's...

408
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 It's amazing though, like it's astonishing that they did it, and the mannequin that you...

409
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 And they still do this today in taxidermy, which I didn't realize, which is you kind of, you take the skin of the animal.

410
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 So it's not, I always thought the insides were probably still there of a taxidermy thing, of an animal, but you actually...

411
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 You thought it was sort of like rotting organs and flesh.

412
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 I thought it was like bones and the bones.

413
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 Yeah, okay.

414
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 It was like a pickle or something, like, you know, it was just, yeah.

415
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 Gross.

416
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 I didn't, to be honest, I haven't really thought about what's inside the dog in my living room.

417
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 But I don't, I don't have that.

418
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 But yeah, but it's basically you buy, as if like you were passing a shop and you saw a mannequin out there and they put the clothes on it.

419
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 It's kind of like that, there's a mannequin shape of the animal, and then you fit the animal over it, which is bizarre, but that's how they do it.

420
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 It's also satisfying like putting a sock on or something.

421
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 Yes, yeah.

422
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 Using it over.

423
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 Or trying to get a tent back into that bag.

424
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 Oh, I was thinking of stretching over, but you're thinking of stuffing in.

425
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 We've got different taxidermy techniques.

426
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 You're right.

427
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 You'd both be fired from the taxidermy club.

428
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 Yeah.

429
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 Just quickly, the Victorians were really bad for dogs.

430
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 We think of the Victorians as dog obsessed because they invented crufts and all this stuff.

431
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 Actually, it was a disaster. They became obsessed with particular breeds because they invented dog shows.

432
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 And this led to this huge genetic bottleneck where loads of dogs, which didn't happen to be fashionable in dog shows, died out.

433
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 So all these breeds of dogs that we don't have anymore, because they weren't suitable for being shown in dog shows or just weren't trendy enough.

434
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 Right.

435
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 But did Crufts used to have a stuffed dog category?

436
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 No, there was never.

437
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 Why do you think they're just dragging it along with traps and stuff?

438
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 They smash through every single fence. It's a disaster.

439
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 I think you just be like, "Stay."

440
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 Well, every dog has won that round.

441
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 The Victorians were really great taxidermists, weren't they?

442
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 They were much more imaginative and creative than maybe you imagine taxidermy.

443
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 They love putting different animals in different human activities.

444
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 So a bit like that picture of dogs playing poker or whatever.

445
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 They put squirrels, particularly. They like to put doing things like boxing.

446
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 So they dress them up in boxing gloves or they'd have croaky playing cats.

447
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 They'd have little rabbits all sitting in a schoolroom with little books they're writing in and spectacles and things like that.

448
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 I mean, it's disgusting, but also quite sweet at the same time.

449
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 There's so many people that we know the names of for very different reasons who were all taxidermists or love taxidermy.

450
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 Yeah, so like Captain Bird's Eye, before he was a fish finger person.

451
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 These taste disgusting.

452
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 He was a taxidermist.

453
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 One day he just sort of noticed, "Oh, I've got all my fingers inside this fish."

454
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 And then he thought, "What if one of the fish was inside the finger?"

455
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 He liked that moment.

456
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 Yeah, in 2017 a woman from Dundee advertised her dog Snoopy on Facebook, who was dead.

457
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 And she wrote, "This is the offer."

458
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 What do you mean advertised?

459
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 Well, she wrote this, "Had our dog turned into a rug when he died,

460
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 treasured family pet has to be sold as new dog keeps trying to hump it."

461
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 And that was Snoopy.

462
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 That was Snoopy.

463
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 Did she get peanuts for it?

464
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 She was looking for £100 on near offer.

465
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 Very cozy and unusual piece, she said.

466
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 I don't know if it's sold.

467
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 That's amazing.

468
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 The father of taxidermy is kind of this cool guy called Carl Aichle.

469
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 I think that's how you pronounce it.

470
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 So he started out stuffing animals in museums, and he really changed it.

471
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 Because back in those days, the idea of taxidermy was just you'd stuff an animal as full as you possibly could.

472
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 So it was really bloated, no idea of its shape, how it was supposed to look.

473
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 Literally, he said if you had a deer, you'd turn it upside down, you'd hang it upside down,

474
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 and you'd just drop stuff from above into its skin, and then you'd sew it up.

475
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 And he came up with the idea of actually making animals look like they had in life.

476
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 And he was amazing, though.

477
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 So he went to Somaliland in 1896, and he was pounced by a leopard,

478
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 and he killed this leopard by shoving his hand down its throat.

479
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 Right.

480
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 I think, wasn't it?

481
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 He was shoving one hand down its throat, and then one hand around its throat.

482
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 And I think the story is that he heard something rustling in a bush,

483
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 and he thought, oh, great, a tortoise or something, quite manageable.

484
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 And he just disappeared into the bush, and then his colleagues saw him rustling with a leopard.

485
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 Oh, my God.

486
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 It was terrifying, yeah.

487
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 He was responsible for a lot of conservation, so he shot gorillas and things,

488
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 and then he started feeling really queasy about it.

489
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 He thought, ah, this isn't right, this feels like murder, to be honest.

490
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 So it's largely thanks to him that a big, I think it's Virunga National Park, Virunga.

491
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 Oh, really?

492
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 That was Africa's first national park, and it was set up largely thanks to his efforts and his advocacy.

493
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 So thanks to him, the mountain gorilla, which he had shot and felt awful, awful about shooting,

494
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 it's largely thanks to him that it survived to the extent it has.

495
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 Oh, wow.

496
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 Yeah, so he really had a 180 turn on this.

497
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

498
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 That's cool.

499
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 I hate to move us on.

500
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 James, do you want to do one more thing?

501
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 Just that if you live in Anchorage, anyone listening, then, and you go to the local library,

502
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 you can get books out, but you can also get stuffed animals out.

503
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 Apparently, this is not quite well known, even if you live in Anchorage,

504
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 but you can go in and you can say, I'd like a stuffed rabbit, please,

505
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 and you can take it out, and then you can bring it back.

506
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 And the most popular thing they do is owls.

507
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 Can you guess why owls are the most popular thing they give out?

508
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 Is it the Harry Potter Cosplay?

509
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 Yeah, close enough.

510
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 It's kids' parties.

511
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 Like, so whenever children in Anchorage have a party,

512
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 if they have a Harry Potter theme party, they always get the stuffed owl out.

513
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 Ah, cool.

514
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 So I can't wait for this podcast to go out.

515
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 The scenes at Anchorage Library the next morning.

516
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 Don't let it be all queuing up.

517
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 Where's my stuffed rabbit?

518
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 Where's my stuffed mountain dog?

519
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 Yeah, yeah.

520
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 Sorry, sorry.

521
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 I was reading Brian Blessed's autobiography,

522
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 and he says that when he was a kid growing up,

523
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 if you found a dead cow on the side of the road,

524
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 you kept it sort of as a toy and you used it with your mates.

525
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 So you'd go around holding a dead cat.

526
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 No, you didn't.

527
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 That's what Brian--

528
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 No, it's called Brian Blessed.

529
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 An exaggerator.

530
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 I'm lying.

531
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 Someone who's going to go around telling fibs.

532
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 I'll tell you.

533
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 I actually sort of believe that he did that.

534
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 He's an extraordinary man, but that's what he said.

535
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 Yeah, and he said you would swing it around,

536
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 like how you'd see a posh person swinging a cane or Charlie Chaplin.

537
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 You would swing it by the tail.

538
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 This is-- I'm just reporting the facts from Brian Blessed.

539
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 Yeah, he could somersault over walls as well, he says.

540
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 OK.

541
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 It's a really good autobiography.

542
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 We're going to have to move on soon, guys, to our next fact.

543
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 Find the fact.

544
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 On the stuffed-- again, lots of ancient stuffing techniques

545
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 and stuffed animals.

546
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 There were lots of railway stations in the UK,

547
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 had station dogs, which in life, they would collect money.

548
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 So there were dozens of these dogs all over the place,

549
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 and they would collect money for particularly the widows

550
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 and children of people who'd worked on the railways

551
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 and died in accidents, things like that.

552
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 So widows and orphans, that kind of stuff.

553
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 There were dozens called London Jack all over London,

554
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 and Slough has stationed Jim still on the platform to this day.

555
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 Oh, really?

556
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 Yeah, and they would collect coins in their mouths originally

557
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 and then just sort of gather the coins together.

558
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 But then they had to have boxes tied to them,

559
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 sort of a little holster.

560
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 And the reason they had to do that was because Brighton Bob

561
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 was found to be buying biscuits at a local bakery with the coins.

562
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 OK, let's move on to our final fact this show.

563
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 Time for a final fact, and that is my fact.

564
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 My fact this week is that in October 2021,

565
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 the pop star Shakira attended the World Championships

566
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 of keeping a balloon in the air for as long as possible.

567
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 There's a slight knowing laugh and applause happening here

568
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 because the audience is aware of something that happened

569
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 in the first half of our show tonight.

570
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 But this is a thing that has started a new annual championship

571
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 that will no doubt rival some of the great championships

572
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 around the world.

573
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 Like a World Cup, an Olympics.

574
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 Exactly.

575
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 And a keeping a balloon in the air.

576
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 The three things that we'll know about the air.

577
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 Yeah, that will be like the egot of the sporting world.

578
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 So the reason Shakira was there is because her partner,

579
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 Gerard Piquet, was part of the organizers

580
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 who set up this world ballooning event.

581
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 Actually, Gerard Piquet has won a World Cup, I'm pretty sure.

582
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 So like if he could win this as well,

583
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 he's only an Olympic title away from the egot.

584
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 God, he's won away.

585
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 Well, that's amazing.

586
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 So yeah, this was set up and it happened in Barcelona

587
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 and all teams came in.

588
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 And basically, if you see pictures of it,

589
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 it is effectively people going around an obstacle course.

590
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 They're representing their countries and teams

591
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 and they're trying to keep a balloon up in the air

592
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 for as long as possible.

593
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 And the whole purpose is you slap the balloon away

594
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 and if it hits the ground, the team loses a point

595
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 and then they have another chance of trying to keep it.

596
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 So you're just diving over.

597
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 You're convincing.

598
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 Yeah, it's two countries in the room at the same time

599
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 and you're hitting it

600
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 so that they won't be able to get to it, right?

601
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 Exactly.

602
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 Otherwise it would be seriously boring.

603
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 Just on incredible achievements in the world of ballooning,

604
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 there is a ballooning Olympics, basically.

605
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 It's called the World Balloon Convention.

606
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 And so you get hundreds and hundreds of twisters as they get known.

607
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 Oh, is this for like making balloon shapes?

608
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 Yeah, and making incredible castles and incredible displays

609
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 and people will turn up and twist, which is that cool phrase for it,

610
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 for 27 hours in a row.

611
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 Like, it's nuts.

612
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 They do it so much.

613
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 And there are lots of people who are enormous celebrities

614
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 in the balloon world.

615
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 One of them is a man called Larry Moss.

616
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 And I didn't just Google Moss plus balloons for anyone listening.

617
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 He has been described as the best balloon artist in the world.

618
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 He once built a haunted house entirely out of balloons.

619
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 An entire haunted house.

620
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 How does that look different to a house?

621
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 Where's made of balloons?

622
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 And so that's in the haunted part.

623
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 What's the haunted part?

624
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 Well, it's shit scary inside.

625
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 You know, it's got sort of...

626
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 Yeah, it's got skeletons made of balloons and, you know,

627
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 zombies made of balloons and vampires.

628
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 And a fully functioning carousel, I think he had,

629
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 like, that you could ride around on made of balloons.

630
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 You saw it as well, Anna.

631
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 Yeah, I know. Oh, I know Moss, yeah.

632
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 It looks frightening, doesn't it?

633
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 Yeah, it's terrifying. It's absolutely terrifying.

634
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 I think the reason he did it was because his wife

635
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 Judy was in a coma in 2003,

636
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 and he promised her that if she woke up,

637
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 he would build her a carousel out of balloons.

638
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 And she did. And so he had to.

639
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 And they're now divorced.

640
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 Really?

641
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 No.

642
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 Beautiful fairytale ending, you hope.

643
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 That was a rollercoaster, Anna.

644
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 So this happens a lot, then.

645
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 We have lots of balloon championships, it sounds like.

646
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 Yeah. That's amazing.

647
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 The twisters are great.

648
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 I was reading about another balloon twister called Ralph Dewey,

649
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 who's written 16 books on balloon twisting.

650
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 Wow.

651
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 And a lot with 14 other books.

652
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 Great works of fiction, I am sure.

653
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 And he's also the...

654
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 He's a member of the Fellowship of Christian Magicians,

655
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 for whom he is the five-time recipient

656
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 of the best balloon lecture.

657
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 Huge.

658
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 He does...

659
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 Anna, you're bearing the lead a bit here,

660
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 because I read a bit about him, too,

661
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 and he's a key figure in the gospel clown movement.

662
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 LAUGHTER

663
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 What is that?

664
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 Well, it's kind of as it is on the tin.

665
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 Like, it's a group of Christian clowns

666
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 who believe in spreading the word of God,

667
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 but through clowning.

668
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 Do they turn a bucket full of confetti into wine?

669
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 I think they just talk a lot about religion,

670
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 and they also do some clown stuff.

671
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 You know, it's like Jesus,

672
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 when he put 27 people in that little car.

673
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 LAUGHTER

674
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 Yeah.

675
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 And this is a huge division in balloon world,

676
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 because there is a schism in the ballooniverse, if you will,

677
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 between gospel twisters who use balloons to teach Bible lessons,

678
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 and will sometimes do things like balloons of Jesus on the cross,

679
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 and adult twisters who do more raunchy balloons.

680
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 Oh, there must be an in-between.

681
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 I think it's not like if you get a balloon guy inside,

682
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 they're going to be a gospel guy or a sexy guy.

683
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 I think there is a sort of small rump of people in the middle

684
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 who are just sick of this balloon infighting.

685
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 Right.

686
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 But there are conventions, obviously, and at the conventions,

687
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 the conventions may not be big enough to only have one or the other,

688
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 so they meet at conventions like the Jets and the Sharks.

689
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 You know, the sexy balloon people and the gospel balloon people.

690
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 Right.

691
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 And it's uncomfortable, it's awkward.

692
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 There must be so many burst balloons when they get to the bit

693
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 called Jesus on the cross.

694
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 Did you read that the FBI were called by multiple pilots

695
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 to investigate a man with a jet pack flying over LA?

696
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 Oh, yes.

697
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 And I didn't realise that whenever someone is seen flying with a jet pack,

698
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 the FBI have to investigate,

699
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 because as far as we know, no one can really fly with a jet pack

700
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 except like a sort of a metre above the ground for about a centimetre,

701
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 and then they fall off.

702
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 Technology hasn't quite got to better levels yet.

703
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 So it must be like the Russians, I guess.

704
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 That's the fear, or the aliens.

705
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 And this was flying at over 900 metres high.

706
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 I think three separate pilots reported it in sort of four separate months,

707
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 so it had obviously been up there for ages.

708
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 I don't know what this person was eating.

709
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 But anyway, the FBI had to investigate it,

710
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 and it turned out it was the character from "Nightmare Before Christmas"

711
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 from a Halloween which had been released.

712
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 Jack Skellington.

713
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 It was a balloon version of Jack Skellington from "Nightmare Before Christmas"

714
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 had sailed up into the sky and was investigated by the FBI.

715
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 It is amazing, because you hear the LA pilots landing,

716
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 and they're like, "There's a jet pack man right next to me."

717
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 It was a real mystery for ages.

718
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 The FBI, by the way, do have to look into some pretty weird things.

719
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 This is going back to an earlier fact,

720
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 but I saw on the FBI website a calling out saying,

721
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 "FBI seeking bad breath bandit in Northern California."

722
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 And it was just a guy who supposedly they thought must have bad breath,

723
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 because he kept going into, this is pre-pandemic with face masks on.

724
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 Do you think they'll have one of those identity parades

725
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 where just people breathed in your face,

726
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 and you're like, "It's definitely that guy."

727
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 Yeah, exactly, yeah.

728
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 Presumably they were seeking him for other crimes than having bad breath.

729
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 Oh, yeah, no, he was robbing banks.

730
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 Why did they think he had bad breath if he was robbing banks and wearing a mask?

731
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 Isn't that absolute RU1 bank robbing?

732
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 Like, what?

733
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 That's such a good point, yes.

734
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 It was like, yeah, no, no, that's just a fucking great point.

735
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
 I don't know what to say.

736
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 I'm not sure this FBI know what they're doing anymore.

737
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 Weirdly, we need to wrap up soon.

738
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 We can do some sports, weird sports, like the balloon thing.

739
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 Yeah, go for it, yeah.

740
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 So there's a company called AKQA,

741
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 and they used artificial intelligence to come up with a new sport.

742
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 They came up with something called Speedgate,

743
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 and this supposedly combines familiar elements of croquet, rugby and soccer.

744
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 Right, sign me up.

745
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
 It sounds great, you've got like a goal in the middle and two goals on either side,

746
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
 and you have to go through the middle goal to get possession,

747
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 and then you have to go round and knock it through the other goal,

748
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 and if you've got a guy on the other side of the other goal,

749
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 then they could knock it back through and you get more points.

750
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 It's amazing, it's quite a good game.

751
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,000
 In Oregon, the Oregon Sports Authority have now officially recognized it as a sport,

752
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 and there's a few universities that actually play it.

753
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 But the other things that the AI came up with were not quite so good.

754
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 So they came up with Underwater Parkour.

755
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
 Amazing.

756
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 They came up with a game where two players were in a hot air balloon and on a tightrope,

757
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 and they had to pass a ball back and forward to each other like tennis,

758
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 and they came up with an exploding Frisbee game,

759
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,000
 where you basically throw the Frisbee to each other and every now and then it just blows up.

760
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 Wood watch.

761
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 That sounds like a great sport.

762
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 Exactly.

763
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
 With Speed Game, which actually is quite a good sport,

764
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 the AI created an official motto for it,

765
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 and it was "Face the ball, to be the ball, and to be above the ball."

766
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 So good.

767
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 It's got a way to go.

768
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 I'd listen to that AI commentating, actually.

769
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 That's great.

770
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
 Have you guys heard of juggling?

771
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 Juggling.

772
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 Is it jogging and juggling?

773
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 Yes.

774
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 It's jogging and juggling together.

775
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 You're a jogger, if you do it,

776
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
 and the championships are held every year at the International Jugglers Association Festival,

777
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 and they're good.

778
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 There is a three-ball event, there's a five-ball event,

779
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
 and a seven-ball event over different lengths,

780
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
 and juggling five balls is unbelievably hard,

781
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
 let alone seven, let alone seven while running,

782
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 but get this, the 100-metre three-ball record is 14 seconds,

783
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 which is faster than I could run for 100 metres, not juggling.

784
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 It's insane. It's absolutely insane.

785
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 I wonder how many times, can you still be holding all three balls

786
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
 and just chuck one up in the air as you cross the finish line?

787
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 Well, you've got to be continuous in juggling.

788
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 That's a great idea.

789
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 You could get one and just chuck it 100 metres,

790
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
 and then leg it to the other end.

791
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:29,000
 I just have to quickly say that the top of this fact

792
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 was about Shakur attending the World Championships

793
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 of Keeping a Balloon in the Air, the Balloon Championships,

794
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 and I didn't say who won the championship.

795
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 So this year, this inaugural year, it was won by Peru,

796
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
 so just so everyone knows it was won by Peru.

797
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 The only reason I didn't say it is because I genuinely spent this entire time

798
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,000
 throughout this whole fact trying to work out what I'd actually written down,

799
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
 because what I've got on my paper says, "One by Perv."

800
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,000
 I thought, "I can't be right."

801
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
 Congratulations, Andy.

802
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
 Years of ball juggling practice to be a pretty good start.

803
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,000
 Anyway, look, we need to wrap up.

804
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
 That is it. That is all of our facts.

805
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
 Thank you so much for listening.

806
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us about the things that we've said

807
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000

812
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 And I just want to quickly say thank you so much to Norban's.

813
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 That was so awesome. We absolutely loved it.

814
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 Thank you for having us. We will be back one day.

815
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
