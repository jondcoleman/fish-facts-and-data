00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.600
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast, this

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.000
 week coming to you live from Siddleburn!

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 [applause]

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 My name is Dan Shriver, I am sitting here with Anna Toshinsky, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 and once again we have gathered round the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 and in no particular order here we go, starting with fact number one and that is Anna.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 My fact this week is that in the 19th century you could be rejected from the army for having bad breath.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 Wow. Why? Why? Let's...

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 The justification is really no more complicated than you think, which is that it's fucking gross for everyone else.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 I can imagine like if you're in a submarine or something.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 If you have to give another sort of the kiss of life, but you accidentally send them into the arms of death.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 I don't think the kiss of life had been invented yet even. This is from a book written in 1840

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 which I don't know why I was reading it but it's called Hints on the Medical Examination of Recruits for the Army

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 and there's some great stuff in there and the thing I read was some recruits are so offensive in their breath

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 as to be intolerable to their mess mates and from these causes are discharged from the French service

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 and ought to be from every other.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 Wow. This book is really good. It's great fun. So I highly recommend it because it's talking about how you examine people for the army

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 and there are lots of reasons for rejecting people, unsound health, fair enough, scrawfielder, loss of teeth, flat feet.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 You had to be inspected sober and naked by the recruiting doctor.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 How are they going to get you naked if you're sober?

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 Great point.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 They also, large testicles, you're out. You're not allowed in the army.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 Oh really? Why is that?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 Any remarkable...

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 Why is it too big a shot like if they're aiming for you?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 Why was the reason for two big balls?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 Any remarkable enlargement or induration of the testicle is a cause of rejection.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 I bet that so many people claim that was why they got rejected. Everyone says it.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 Everyone's leaning away from their breath. Actually it was the testicle that meant I didn't get it.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 I think they're talking about sort of hydroceals or conditions where you have it but they really do get very big indeed.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 Yeah, well also you get turned away for having a narrow chest or for relaxed abdominal rings.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 Which I think might just mean you'd die a year.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 I don't know. For me that was like having like a belly, like what do you call them, like love handles kind of thing.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 Oh, that makes a lot of sense.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 That makes more sense. Imagine that inspection if it's up the anus.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 No, sorry mate.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 Your abdominal rings are...

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 Not tense enough for me.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 Okay.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 Cranky.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 I've never said that before.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 If anything that would make me more tense.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 Oh, there was also, so when it was talking about how to, because you get turned away for being a habitual drunk.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 And so the book gives information on how to spot a habitual drunk.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 And it says you can sense it on their breath, so that's another reason why bad breathing might get rejected for it.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 Because if you can smell old alcohol on their breath.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 And also look out for grog blossoms.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 Do you know what they are?

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 I think they're like spots on your nose or something.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 Sort of like a flush.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 A general that ruddy flush that you get.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 Basically it's burst blood vessels.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 Yeah, you're skirting around it.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 Yeah, isn't that because you know, if you're an alcoholic, you've got burst blood vessels all over your face.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 I like grog blossoms.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 Yeah, it's cool.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 It was in the news quite recently that too many people were getting turned away from the British army.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 And it was like, oh, this is the end of the world. This is going to happen.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 There was a guy in Leeds called Jack 17. We don't know his surname.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 And he said that he didn't get in because he had acne.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 He said there was two things. He had acne and cold hands and feet on the day of the test.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 And he said, well, I've had acne before and it literally just clears up within a day or so.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 And also it's snowing outside.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 Right.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
 But they were having none of it and they wouldn't let him in.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 Yeah, but it hasn't put him off. He's going to reapply when his acne goes.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 It's the summer, maybe.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 But why, the enemy is not going to shoot at you more if you've got acne.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 Well, this was a weird thing.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 They found that there were so many medical conditions that they were turning away that as a result,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 they were really understaffed for new recruits for the army.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 So they had a target of 82,000 people and they fell short 5,000 because people would be turned away for acne.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000
 They were being turned away because, you know, someone had a nut allergy, which, you know, apparently that's important.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 If you're going to go and seize that nut factory from the enemy, then that's the problem, isn't it?

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 Well, I guess it makes it easier. Yeah, if you're allergic to nuts, you know, if Bond was allergic to nuts, it's way easier to kill him, right?

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
 Do you think what you would do is tie him down on a table and just throw peanuts closer and closer to him?

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 Yes.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 So they land him in his nuts.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 And that's the cause. It's an airborne nut allergy, in which case you just need to leave a packet of peanuts slowly being opened by a machine.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 And that's the thing. Then he's got to get out before the packet of nuts.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 So I will watch all of these all of these scenarios happen.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 He said and the reason that this guy in the news is because nut allergies can be very, really, really dangerous.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 But he had a nut allergy that he didn't need an EpiPen for and hadn't had any reaction for over 10 years.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 Yeah.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 So that was the thing about that.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 Yeah.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 There was, you guys may well have come across this in your research in 2020.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 There was a potential recruit who was rejected from the army for having a tattoo.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 And the problem is that once you apply to the army, if you say you have tattoos, they ask you to send in photos of the tattoos.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 And he had a six inch tattoo of a penis on him and they said that's no good.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 We're not allowed that.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000
 How realistic was this tattoo?

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 It was extremely realistic.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 But couldn't you not have just said this is my actual penis?

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 Yeah.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 It was in the uncanny valley between looking too much like a penis to be comfortable with, but not so much like a penis that you think of that.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 But you feel nice and comfortable.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 Exactly. Thank you.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 Was he turned away?

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 He was turned away.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 He was turned away.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
 Thank you for your interest, but we can't take you into the army.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 So the rules are very strict on any tattoos which have kind of, you know, sexual meanings or offensive meanings or potentially offensive meanings.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 Where was it?

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 It was, well, that's the thing which I think is slightly unfair.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 It was on his inner thigh.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 So it wasn't in the wrong place.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 Was it to remind him where to leave it?

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 Like a parking spot.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 It was a very roomy parking spot.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 It really was.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 It's quite, like, it's...

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 Why would you do a big one? You've got the comparison right there.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 Do a tiny, tiny penis?

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 Well, because you can see it right.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 It's cold. Here's what it usually looks like.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 It's a perfect alibi.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 Oh, it's staying on my leg again from my penis earlier in the day in a hot room.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 It's not even once, like, trying to get into being rejected from the army before you get into it.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 There's a story I read which is of someone who was in the army who they were desperately trying to get out through loopholes.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 And this was Timothy Leary who was, you know, LSD.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 He was one of the big gurus.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 He was a counterculture character in America.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 And he was part of the Armed Forces in America.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 And he kind of did a lot of pranks and he exposed some of the generals to weird things that embarrassed them.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 So they desperately tried to get him out.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:44.000
 So he was shaving once and he cut himself and they tried to get him out on the grounds that he damaged military property.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 And was he the property himself?

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 Yes, because when you're apart, and this was back in the 50s and 60s, when you sign up to the military, you sign your body over, you are the military.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 So that was damaged to their property when he cut himself.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 What if you cut your nails?

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 Well, they were trying to get him out so they were loop-holing it.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 I know, but it sounds like, did it work?

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 He stayed in. He managed to, he managed to stay in, but they desperately tried all these things.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 Another group of people who wanted people to leave the army or leave the British army was the Nazis.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 And so they decided that they would drop a load of leaflets on the Allied forces to give them tricks of how to get kicked out of the army.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 And the thing said, oh, you've done a really good job, but now's the time to, you know, give up because you're going to lose anyway.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 So this is the best way to get out of the army.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 So they had these little pamphlets.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 One of them advised men to fake heart disease by smoking 20 to 30 cigarettes per day.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 And it said, if you normally smoke that much already, why not double the number?

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 There was an interview in Vice Arabia, which interviewed people who'd successfully exempted themselves from the army and found ways of doing it.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 And one guy said he just spent months and months completely gorging constantly.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 So every meal he'd eat, burgers, pizzas, pastries, he said, I added mayonnaise to everything I ate.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 And then I would have mayonnaise as its own snack between meals.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 He gained five stone in six months.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 That's amazing. Mayonnaise is a snack.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 Yeah, delicious. I know. Probably he wasn't doing it already.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
 We're going to have to move on very soon to our next fact since it's gone so quick.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:24.000
 Just quickly on bad breath and halitosis, the phrase, often a bridesmaid never a bride, that comes from listerine.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 And it was to do with bad breath.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 Yeah, so these were adverts in America where they would have wording like Edna's case was a really pathetic one.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 Like every woman, her primary ambition was to marry.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 Most of the girls of her set were married or about to be, yet no one possessed more grace or charm or loveliness than she.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 As her birthdays crept towards the tragic 30 mark, marriage seemed farther from her life than ever.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 She was often a bridesmaid, but never a bride.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 And that popularized that phrase and that's why we use it.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 Their adverts are unbelievable examples in basically negging your audience.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 So they're all things like he never knew why and it shows someone being socially shunned or they say it behind your back.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 Or, my favourite one, are you unpopular with your own children?

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 I know you think it's because your balls are too big, but I'm promising you got a halitosis.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:31.000
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is James.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 Okay, my fact this week is that in 1888 there was a squatting competition in India.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 Despite being up against the country's best wrestlers, the winner was a ten-year-old boy who managed several thousand squats but was then bedridden for a week.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 So cool.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 So this is the exercise, the squats basically.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 And this is a young boy who later became a wrestler and he was known as the Great Gama and he's one of the most famous wrestlers from Indian history.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 In the time there was loads of Maharajas and stuff like that and there was this guy called the Maharajra Jodpa and he decided that he wanted to find the greatest squatter in the whole of the land.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 And they got all these wrestlers in to see who could do it best.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 And this guy who was his original name was Ghulam Muhammad Baksh but he was coming from a really kind of a wrestling dynasty and his father had died quite young.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 And they decided this young boy was going to be the greatest wrestler in the whole world and we're going to do it even at the age of ten.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
 He's going to do loads and loads of squats, loads of push-ups, everything.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 And at the age of ten he managed to beat all of these wrestlers in the whole country.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 To be fair, you've got less distance to cover if you're ten and squatting.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 I would say that every squat should count for half a squat.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 Oh wow.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 That would be the rule that I imposed, right? It's much easier to go up.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 You haven't been through puberty so you've got less muscle mass so it's harder.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 I think Hannah's a bit right because you know like on Britain's gone talent when the kids win but they're actually a bit shit compared to the adults.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 To be fair to him, yes he was a kid so maybe he had an advantage but this guy...

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 If he didn't have an advantage, I didn't mean that seriously.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 I'm not slamming him just in case someone's alive who's descended from Gama and they are.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 He didn't have an advantage.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 Okay, cool.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 Don't try to Hannah down and squat on her.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 But how do you feel about the tightness of these rings?

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 This guy went on to be one of the greatest wrestling champions of all time.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000
 That was like watching when you watch a Superman movie and Superman discovers...

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 He effectively became world champion.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 Everyone called him the world champion.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 They didn't have proper championships in those days but they called him the world champion.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 By the time he was an adult we got a picture of him here.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
 He had 30 inch thighs and 56 inch chest.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 Just to put that into context, there was a guy called Roberto Carlos who some of you might know

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 a soccer player who had famously massive thighs.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 His were 24 inches compared to 30 inch for Gama.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 His inch was 56 inches and Arnold Schwarzenegger's chest was 42 inches.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 That's how big this guy was.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 Gosh, his diet, the training sounds incredible.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 His daily diet included 6 pounds of butter, 10 litres of milk,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 half a litre of ghee which is basically clarified butter.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
 A few snacks of mayonnaise.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 And one sachet of Hellman's mayonnaise every day.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 He did 3,000 press-ups a day and had 40 wrestling belts against other people.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 And 5,000 squats a day.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 I didn't think it was essential to making a world champion

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 but I tried some today just to feel what it's like.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 It's hard to squat, yes?

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 Like after the first three, it's really...

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 Well, thank you, Joe Wicks.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 We don't know exactly how many he did actually.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 We have his work for it, they did 5,000.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 We know it was very, very high but we don't know exactly how much it was

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 and that's because no one ever saw him start a routine and then the routine

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 because no one stayed in the gym for as long as he did.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 That's brilliant.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 Very boring spectators for watching someone squat to be fair.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
 I did think that with the squats that if you were doing a competition

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 and watching how many squats are going on, how do you monitor each individual?

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 Like do you have like a little bell at the bottom?

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 There should be an angle you have to hit, shouldn't there?

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 It was basically time.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
 Oh, so we just continued the squats.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
 And they asked him how many he did.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 They're pretty certain it was over 2,000.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 He said he'd done thousands but had lost count

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 but they knew that it was over 2,000.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 So it's a modern record of consecutive squats, about 3,200.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 So it's not completely out of the question number.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 It's kind of a reasonable number.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
 Have you ever asked a 10-year-old how many times did you just run around the garden?

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 Oh, a million.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
 Yeah, okay, we'll write that down in the history books.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 I've already got it in for the child stars and child afterings today.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 He never chose a word.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
 I also don't chose a word of his diet.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 I don't think there are any legends that build up around these people.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 The details of his diet are just implausible.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 You'd have a heart attack.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000
 He was consuming like 50,000 calories a day as far as the legend is concerned.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 You wouldn't have time to do anything else.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 I'm not calling him a liar, I'm calling his press team liars.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 I kind of agree with you.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 I think this whole period of entertainment from magicians

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 through to these strong men acts and stuff like that,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 it's a period where there is no truth, I feel.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 Well, that's plausible. You are going to love this next one.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 This is a more recent report, actually.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 This is a report from the Telegraph a few years ago, I think it was in 2011.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 This is about someone who could do one-finger push-ups, okay?

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
 So it's an athlete called Qi Guizhong from China who holds,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
 and I'm quoting directly here,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 holds the record for the most one-finger push-ups in 30 seconds.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 He did 41 one-finger push-ups in 30 seconds, set that in December 2011.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 I'm still quoting, "The power of Guizhong's finger is so strong,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 "he is said to be able to kill a man just by pointing at them."

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 Yes!

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 Oh, wow.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 That's amazing.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 What do you think was that?

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 That was in the Telegraph.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
 I just love the idea of him, you know, he's trying to pick teams in football.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 You? Oh, shit. Oh, no.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 You know, birds do press-ups before they fly. Baby birds.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 Really? How sweet is that? That's amazing.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
 Is that to get their muscles better? Is that really?

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 Exactly. They have this puppy fat when they're young,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 and before they fly, they have to have enough strength.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 Obviously, you can't just try flying, especially if you're leaving a high nest.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
 And swifts have been observed. They do these press-ups

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 where they push and extend their wings,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 and they rest on the wingtips for up to nine seconds.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 Wow.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 I mean, almost all animals don't do exercise.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 No, hasn't caught on.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
 No, but that's because animals don't have to do exercise normally,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 because muscle changes get triggered by not exercising most animals.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 So, like, bears, it gets triggered by seasonal changes, the weather changes,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 and then it just releases muscle-forming compounds into their bloodstream,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 and then they get fit. That would be useful.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 Really? It's incredible. Yeah, humans do not have this skill.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 Wow. But scientists try to...

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 Just like if every, you know, every April just you'd walked into the office

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 and everyone's buffers happen.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 Exactly. It's so good.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 It's so unfair that we don't have this.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
 Morning. Good morning.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 Someone comes in still really skinny and forgot to hibernate.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
 Can't believe it.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 Baby birds do do that.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
 But birds do that even before they're babies.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 They exercise in the egg. They exercise if you can say it.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 No, no, come on. Really? That's incredible.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 This is true. So, these are baby birds who are parasitic birds.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
 You know, like cockles, for instance.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 They lay an egg in another bird's nest,

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 and then their baby will come out,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 and often they'll attack the other birds.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
 And they found some parasitic birds

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
 who will do exercises inside the eggs

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
 so that when they hatch, they're already hench as fuck

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
 so they can beat up all the other birds.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 Isn't that amazing?

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
 That's so funny.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 Going back to Gama for a second,

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 there's a really cool thing where there's a museum that you can go to

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 that has a giant rock that he once lifted,

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 and it's so heavy that they were like,

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 "That needs to go in a museum."

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 So it's 1,200 kilograms heavy.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 Well, he never lifted that.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 So, I mean, like, he might have been said to have lifted it,

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 but no one's ever lifted more than 600 or 700 kilos.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 As far as we know.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 Pick Andy up on the old pointing fingers attack.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 Well, I'm saying he's picked up a rock.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 Okay, I think that never happened either.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 That's about as heavy as a bull, right?

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 Or like a big bull, or a quite small hippo, I think.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 Yeah, maybe.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 But smaller in size, right?

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 Like, it's harder to pick up a hippo.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 Sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 Unless you go underneath it and sort of lift it up.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 It fights back, though, which rocks don't.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 I think that's often why they use weights

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 rather than hippos in these contexts.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 You know that when you've done exercise

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 and you have muscle and then you don't exercise for a while

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 and you lose the muscle.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
 Atrophies. Atrophies, yeah.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 That is an evolutionary aid. We're designed to do that.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
 It's a good thing, really, yeah.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 This is because kilos of muscle are really expensive to maintain.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 And you are about 40% muscle on average.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 And so it's a lot of your energy.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 It's about a fifth of your basic energy budget.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
 It just goes on keeping your muscles going.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 So actually, it's an advantage that you don't keep the muscle

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 when you stop exercising. It doesn't feel like it.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 It would be very nice if you just kept it forever.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 I'm having a real flashback on your behalf

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 after you being 14 at school

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 and explaining this to the seven bullies around you.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000
 Guys, you're actually very inefficiently big.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:15.000
 Do you know Zumba? We were talking about exercise.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 Zumba used to be called a rumba size.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 Can you think of where the word rumba size comes from?

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 It's two words together.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 Is there a dance called the rumba? The rumba, yeah.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 Exercise. No, no, no. It comes from a mixture of rumba and jazzercise.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 Of course.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 Jazzercise, I find really interesting.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 So jazzercise was started by a woman called Judy Sheppard-Missett in 1969.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000
 And basically she did it just as a warm-up to start off with.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000
 And everyone loved it.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 And soon it was all over the country in the US

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 and then eventually all over the world. Absolutely huge.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 She decided she wanted to turn it into a thing.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 So she went to her bank and she said,

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 "Can you give me some money to kind of set up this jazzercise thing?"

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000
 And the bank looked at the numbers and they said,

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 "No, this is just a fad. It's a complete waste of time."

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 And then she said, "Seven years later, that bank went out of business.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
 "Fifty years later, she was still working."

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000
 Isn't that cool?

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 I don't know what the hell jazzercise is,

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 so I don't know who these hordes of people are who are doing it.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 I would have thought it was incredibly difficult to exercise jazz music.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 If there's one genre of music I'm not exercising to,

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000
 it's Miles Davis crudely laying.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 I'll be honest, it's more just jazzy than jazz.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 Probably more trap jazz than like a 12-minute bassoon solo.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 We're going to have to move on in a sec to our next fact.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 Can I tell you my favourite squat terminology that I learned?

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 It's Finnish and it's slang used in Finland, and it's squat wine.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 Squat wine. Life has a drink wine.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 So squat wine is a wine that is so cheap that they keep it on the lowest shelves of a supermarket.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000
 You need a squat to get down to read the labels.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 That's so good.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 My fact is, there was a breed of dogs in Victorian times

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 which only existed in taxidermy form.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 The perfect pet.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 It's quite weird, isn't it, because how do you stuff something that doesn't exist?

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 Well, exactly.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 So this is from an exhibit at the Horniman Museum in south London, which is a great museum.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 They've got lots of stuff, and lots of stuffing.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 They've got lots of stuff things.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 And they've got these dogs, which they look like dogs, but they're not proper dogs.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000
 So they're dog skin.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 Basically, the Victorians loved tiny dogs.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 Guys, just tune out for a while. I'll come back.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:48.000
 What we know up here, because we've had to read about this fact, is that Andy's trying to describe something quite gruesome.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 It's quite charming. They took still their puppies, and they loved miniature dogs, and they loved incredibly tiny toy dogs,

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 but there are dogs which don't exist in this smaller form in their actual life.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 So they would take puppies that had not been born alive, would arrange those into the shape and sort of situation of proper adult dogs,

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.000
 but looking tiny, they called them Roman dogs or dwarf dogs, and they were kind of fashionable things to have.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000
 So basically, it's an incredibly tiny, great dane in a glass case.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 But the thing is that actually, they kind of convinced people that they were real kind of lilliputian, you know, St. Bernard's or whatever, didn't they?

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.000
 They were like, it's normally a big dog, this is a real tiny one, you can buy it for thousands of pounds.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 And people did buy it for thousands of pounds, not knowing that they had this kind of trick.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 It's like the micro pig craze from about ten years ago.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:41.000
 Well, when people accidentally just bought normal pigs that were piglets.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 Yeah, so it is pretty gruesome, but it's...

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000
 It's amazing though, like it's astonishing that they did it, and the mannequin that you...

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:55.000
 And they still do this today in taxidermy, which I didn't realize, which is you kind of, you take the skin of the animal.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.000
 So it's not, I always thought the insides were probably still there of a taxidermy thing, of an animal, but you actually...

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000
 You thought it was sort of like rotting organs and flesh.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000
 I thought it was like bones and the bones.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 Yeah, okay.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000
 It was like a pickle or something, like, you know, it was just, yeah.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 Gross.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 I didn't, to be honest, I haven't really thought about what's inside the dog in my living room.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 But I don't, I don't have that.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 But yeah, but it's basically you buy, as if like you were passing a shop and you saw a mannequin out there and they put the clothes on it.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:32.000
 It's kind of like that, there's a mannequin shape of the animal, and then you fit the animal over it, which is bizarre, but that's how they do it.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 It's also satisfying like putting a sock on or something.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.000
 Yes, yeah.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.000
 Using it over.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000
 Or trying to get a tent back into that bag.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 Oh, I was thinking of stretching over, but you're thinking of stuffing in.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 We've got different taxidermy techniques.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 You're right.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 You'd both be fired from the taxidermy club.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000
 Yeah.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000
 Just quickly, the Victorians were really bad for dogs.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 We think of the Victorians as dog obsessed because they invented crufts and all this stuff.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 Actually, it was a disaster. They became obsessed with particular breeds because they invented dog shows.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 And this led to this huge genetic bottleneck where loads of dogs, which didn't happen to be fashionable in dog shows, died out.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 So all these breeds of dogs that we don't have anymore, because they weren't suitable for being shown in dog shows or just weren't trendy enough.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.000
 Right.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
 But did Crufts used to have a stuffed dog category?

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 No, there was never.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 Why do you think they're just dragging it along with traps and stuff?

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 They smash through every single fence. It's a disaster.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 I think you just be like, "Stay."

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000
 Well, every dog has won that round.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 The Victorians were really great taxidermists, weren't they?

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000
 They were much more imaginative and creative than maybe you imagine taxidermy.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 They love putting different animals in different human activities.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000
 So a bit like that picture of dogs playing poker or whatever.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.000
 They put squirrels, particularly. They like to put doing things like boxing.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000
 So they dress them up in boxing gloves or they'd have croaky playing cats.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:06.000
 They'd have little rabbits all sitting in a schoolroom with little books they're writing in and spectacles and things like that.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000
 I mean, it's disgusting, but also quite sweet at the same time.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:17.000
 There's so many people that we know the names of for very different reasons who were all taxidermists or love taxidermy.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:23.000
 Yeah, so like Captain Bird's Eye, before he was a fish finger person.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000
 These taste disgusting.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 He was a taxidermist.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 One day he just sort of noticed, "Oh, I've got all my fingers inside this fish."

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:39.000
 And then he thought, "What if one of the fish was inside the finger?"

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 He liked that moment.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 Yeah, in 2017 a woman from Dundee advertised her dog Snoopy on Facebook, who was dead.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000
 And she wrote, "This is the offer."

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 What do you mean advertised?

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000
 Well, she wrote this, "Had our dog turned into a rug when he died,

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 treasured family pet has to be sold as new dog keeps trying to hump it."

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000
 And that was Snoopy.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 That was Snoopy.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 Did she get peanuts for it?

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 She was looking for £100 on near offer.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000
 Very cozy and unusual piece, she said.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 I don't know if it's sold.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.000
 That's amazing.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.000
 The father of taxidermy is kind of this cool guy called Carl Aichle.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 I think that's how you pronounce it.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000
 So he started out stuffing animals in museums, and he really changed it.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:33.000
 Because back in those days, the idea of taxidermy was just you'd stuff an animal as full as you possibly could.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.000
 So it was really bloated, no idea of its shape, how it was supposed to look.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000
 Literally, he said if you had a deer, you'd turn it upside down, you'd hang it upside down,

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.000
 and you'd just drop stuff from above into its skin, and then you'd sew it up.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000
 And he came up with the idea of actually making animals look like they had in life.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000
 And he was amazing, though.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 So he went to Somaliland in 1896, and he was pounced by a leopard,

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 and he killed this leopard by shoving his hand down its throat.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.000
 Right.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000
 I think, wasn't it?

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000
 He was shoving one hand down its throat, and then one hand around its throat.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.000
 And I think the story is that he heard something rustling in a bush,

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000
 and he thought, oh, great, a tortoise or something, quite manageable.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000
 And he just disappeared into the bush, and then his colleagues saw him rustling with a leopard.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 Oh, my God.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 It was terrifying, yeah.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 He was responsible for a lot of conservation, so he shot gorillas and things,

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000
 and then he started feeling really queasy about it.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000
 He thought, ah, this isn't right, this feels like murder, to be honest.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 So it's largely thanks to him that a big, I think it's Virunga National Park, Virunga.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 Oh, really?

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 That was Africa's first national park, and it was set up largely thanks to his efforts and his advocacy.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.000
 So thanks to him, the mountain gorilla, which he had shot and felt awful, awful about shooting,

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000
 it's largely thanks to him that it survived to the extent it has.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.000
 Oh, wow.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 Yeah, so he really had a 180 turn on this.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 That's cool.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.000
 I hate to move us on.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 James, do you want to do one more thing?

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 Just that if you live in Anchorage, anyone listening, then, and you go to the local library,

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000
 you can get books out, but you can also get stuffed animals out.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000
 Apparently, this is not quite well known, even if you live in Anchorage,

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 but you can go in and you can say, I'd like a stuffed rabbit, please,

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000
 and you can take it out, and then you can bring it back.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000
 And the most popular thing they do is owls.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 Can you guess why owls are the most popular thing they give out?

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000
 Is it the Harry Potter Cosplay?

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000
 Yeah, close enough.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 It's kids' parties.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000
 Like, so whenever children in Anchorage have a party,

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000
 if they have a Harry Potter theme party, they always get the stuffed owl out.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000
 Ah, cool.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000
 So I can't wait for this podcast to go out.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 The scenes at Anchorage Library the next morning.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 Don't let it be all queuing up.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 Where's my stuffed rabbit?

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000
 Where's my stuffed mountain dog?

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.000
 Sorry, sorry.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 I was reading Brian Blessed's autobiography,

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 and he says that when he was a kid growing up,

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000
 if you found a dead cow on the side of the road,

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000
 you kept it sort of as a toy and you used it with your mates.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 So you'd go around holding a dead cat.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.000
 No, you didn't.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 That's what Brian--

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 No, it's called Brian Blessed.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000
 An exaggerator.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 I'm lying.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000
 Someone who's going to go around telling fibs.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 I'll tell you.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000
 I actually sort of believe that he did that.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000
 He's an extraordinary man, but that's what he said.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 Yeah, and he said you would swing it around,

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000
 like how you'd see a posh person swinging a cane or Charlie Chaplin.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
 You would swing it by the tail.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:28.000
 This is-- I'm just reporting the facts from Brian Blessed.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000
 Yeah, he could somersault over walls as well, he says.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 OK.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000
 It's a really good autobiography.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000
 We're going to have to move on soon, guys, to our next fact.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 Find the fact.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000
 On the stuffed-- again, lots of ancient stuffing techniques

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.000
 and stuffed animals.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000
 There were lots of railway stations in the UK,

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:51.000
 had station dogs, which in life, they would collect money.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.000
 So there were dozens of these dogs all over the place,

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000
 and they would collect money for particularly the widows

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 and children of people who'd worked on the railways

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000
 and died in accidents, things like that.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000
 So widows and orphans, that kind of stuff.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000
 There were dozens called London Jack all over London,

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000
 and Slough has stationed Jim still on the platform to this day.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 Oh, really?

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 Yeah, and they would collect coins in their mouths originally

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000
 and then just sort of gather the coins together.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000
 But then they had to have boxes tied to them,

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 sort of a little holster.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000
 And the reason they had to do that was because Brighton Bob

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000
 was found to be buying biscuits at a local bakery with the coins.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:35.000
 OK, let's move on to our final fact this show.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000
 Time for a final fact, and that is my fact.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 My fact this week is that in October 2021,

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000
 the pop star Shakira attended the World Championships

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.000
 of keeping a balloon in the air for as long as possible.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 There's a slight knowing laugh and applause happening here

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 because the audience is aware of something that happened

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000
 in the first half of our show tonight.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 But this is a thing that has started a new annual championship

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000
 that will no doubt rival some of the great championships

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 around the world.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 Like a World Cup, an Olympics.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 Exactly.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000
 And a keeping a balloon in the air.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 The three things that we'll know about the air.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000
 Yeah, that will be like the egot of the sporting world.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.000
 So the reason Shakira was there is because her partner,

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000
 Gerard Piquet, was part of the organizers

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000
 who set up this world ballooning event.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 Actually, Gerard Piquet has won a World Cup, I'm pretty sure.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000
 So like if he could win this as well,

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000
 he's only an Olympic title away from the egot.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000
 God, he's won away.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000
 Well, that's amazing.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000
 So yeah, this was set up and it happened in Barcelona

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 and all teams came in.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000
 And basically, if you see pictures of it,

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000
 it is effectively people going around an obstacle course.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000
 They're representing their countries and teams

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.000
 and they're trying to keep a balloon up in the air

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.000
 for as long as possible.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000
 And the whole purpose is you slap the balloon away

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000
 and if it hits the ground, the team loses a point

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000
 and then they have another chance of trying to keep it.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.000
 So you're just diving over.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 You're convincing.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000
 Yeah, it's two countries in the room at the same time

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.000
 and you're hitting it

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000
 so that they won't be able to get to it, right?

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.000
 Exactly.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000
 Otherwise it would be seriously boring.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 Just on incredible achievements in the world of ballooning,

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.000
 there is a ballooning Olympics, basically.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000
 It's called the World Balloon Convention.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.000
 And so you get hundreds and hundreds of twisters as they get known.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 Oh, is this for like making balloon shapes?

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000
 Yeah, and making incredible castles and incredible displays

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000
 and people will turn up and twist, which is that cool phrase for it,

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000
 for 27 hours in a row.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 Like, it's nuts.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.000
 They do it so much.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000
 And there are lots of people who are enormous celebrities

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 in the balloon world.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000
 One of them is a man called Larry Moss.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000
 And I didn't just Google Moss plus balloons for anyone listening.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000
 He has been described as the best balloon artist in the world.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 He once built a haunted house entirely out of balloons.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.000
 An entire haunted house.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000
 How does that look different to a house?

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000
 Where's made of balloons?

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000
 And so that's in the haunted part.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.000
 What's the haunted part?

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000
 Well, it's shit scary inside.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000
 You know, it's got sort of...

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000
 Yeah, it's got skeletons made of balloons and, you know,

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000
 zombies made of balloons and vampires.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000
 And a fully functioning carousel, I think he had,

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000
 like, that you could ride around on made of balloons.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.000
 You saw it as well, Anna.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000
 Yeah, I know. Oh, I know Moss, yeah.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 It looks frightening, doesn't it?

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000
 Yeah, it's terrifying. It's absolutely terrifying.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000
 I think the reason he did it was because his wife

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000
 Judy was in a coma in 2003,

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000
 and he promised her that if she woke up,

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000
 he would build her a carousel out of balloons.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000
 And she did. And so he had to.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000
 And they're now divorced.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000
 Really?

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000
 No.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000
 Beautiful fairytale ending, you hope.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000
 That was a rollercoaster, Anna.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000
 So this happens a lot, then.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000
 We have lots of balloon championships, it sounds like.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.000
 Yeah. That's amazing.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.000
 The twisters are great.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000
 I was reading about another balloon twister called Ralph Dewey,

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000
 who's written 16 books on balloon twisting.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 Wow.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000
 And a lot with 14 other books.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000
 Great works of fiction, I am sure.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000
 And he's also the...

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000
 He's a member of the Fellowship of Christian Magicians,

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.000
 for whom he is the five-time recipient

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000
 of the best balloon lecture.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000
 Huge.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.000
 He does...

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000
 Anna, you're bearing the lead a bit here,

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000
 because I read a bit about him, too,

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000
 and he's a key figure in the gospel clown movement.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.000
 LAUGHTER

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.000
 What is that?

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000
 Well, it's kind of as it is on the tin.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000
 Like, it's a group of Christian clowns

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000
 who believe in spreading the word of God,

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000
 but through clowning.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000
 Do they turn a bucket full of confetti into wine?

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.000
 I think they just talk a lot about religion,

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000
 and they also do some clown stuff.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000
 You know, it's like Jesus,

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000
 when he put 27 people in that little car.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000
 LAUGHTER

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.000
 Yeah.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:05.000
 And this is a huge division in balloon world,

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:10.000
 because there is a schism in the ballooniverse, if you will,

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:15.000
 between gospel twisters who use balloons to teach Bible lessons,

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000
 and will sometimes do things like balloons of Jesus on the cross,

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000
 and adult twisters who do more raunchy balloons.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000
 Oh, there must be an in-between.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000
 I think it's not like if you get a balloon guy inside,

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 they're going to be a gospel guy or a sexy guy.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.000
 I think there is a sort of small rump of people in the middle

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000
 who are just sick of this balloon infighting.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.000
 Right.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000
 But there are conventions, obviously, and at the conventions,

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000
 the conventions may not be big enough to only have one or the other,

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 so they meet at conventions like the Jets and the Sharks.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000
 You know, the sexy balloon people and the gospel balloon people.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.000
 Right.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000
 And it's uncomfortable, it's awkward.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000
 There must be so many burst balloons when they get to the bit

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000
 called Jesus on the cross.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:02.000
 Did you read that the FBI were called by multiple pilots

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000
 to investigate a man with a jet pack flying over LA?

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.000
 Oh, yes.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000
 And I didn't realise that whenever someone is seen flying with a jet pack,

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 the FBI have to investigate,

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000
 because as far as we know, no one can really fly with a jet pack

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000
 except like a sort of a metre above the ground for about a centimetre,

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.000
 and then they fall off.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000
 Technology hasn't quite got to better levels yet.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000
 So it must be like the Russians, I guess.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000
 That's the fear, or the aliens.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.000
 And this was flying at over 900 metres high.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000
 I think three separate pilots reported it in sort of four separate months,

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000
 so it had obviously been up there for ages.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000
 I don't know what this person was eating.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000
 But anyway, the FBI had to investigate it,

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.000
 and it turned out it was the character from "Nightmare Before Christmas"

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000
 from a Halloween which had been released.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.000
 Jack Skellington.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.000
 It was a balloon version of Jack Skellington from "Nightmare Before Christmas"

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000
 had sailed up into the sky and was investigated by the FBI.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000
 It is amazing, because you hear the LA pilots landing,

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000
 and they're like, "There's a jet pack man right next to me."

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000
 It was a real mystery for ages.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.000
 The FBI, by the way, do have to look into some pretty weird things.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000
 This is going back to an earlier fact,

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.000
 but I saw on the FBI website a calling out saying,

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000
 "FBI seeking bad breath bandit in Northern California."

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000
 And it was just a guy who supposedly they thought must have bad breath,

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000
 because he kept going into, this is pre-pandemic with face masks on.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000
 Do you think they'll have one of those identity parades

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000
 where just people breathed in your face,

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000
 and you're like, "It's definitely that guy."

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000
 Yeah, exactly, yeah.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000
 Presumably they were seeking him for other crimes than having bad breath.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000
 Oh, yeah, no, he was robbing banks.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:38.000
 Why did they think he had bad breath if he was robbing banks and wearing a mask?

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.000
 Isn't that absolute RU1 bank robbing?

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000
 Like, what?

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000
 That's such a good point, yes.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000
 It was like, yeah, no, no, that's just a fucking great point.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000
 I don't know what to say.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000
 I'm not sure this FBI know what they're doing anymore.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000
 Weirdly, we need to wrap up soon.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000
 We can do some sports, weird sports, like the balloon thing.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000
 Yeah, go for it, yeah.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000
 So there's a company called AKQA,

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.000
 and they used artificial intelligence to come up with a new sport.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000
 They came up with something called Speedgate,

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:16.000
 and this supposedly combines familiar elements of croquet, rugby and soccer.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000
 Right, sign me up.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.000
 It sounds great, you've got like a goal in the middle and two goals on either side,

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000
 and you have to go through the middle goal to get possession,

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.000
 and then you have to go round and knock it through the other goal,

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000
 and if you've got a guy on the other side of the other goal,

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000
 then they could knock it back through and you get more points.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000
 It's amazing, it's quite a good game.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:37.000
 In Oregon, the Oregon Sports Authority have now officially recognized it as a sport,

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.000
 and there's a few universities that actually play it.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000
 But the other things that the AI came up with were not quite so good.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.000
 So they came up with Underwater Parkour.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.000
 Amazing.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:56.000
 They came up with a game where two players were in a hot air balloon and on a tightrope,

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.000
 and they had to pass a ball back and forward to each other like tennis,

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.000
 and they came up with an exploding Frisbee game,

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:09.000
 where you basically throw the Frisbee to each other and every now and then it just blows up.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000
 Wood watch.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000
 That sounds like a great sport.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.000
 Exactly.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000
 With Speed Game, which actually is quite a good sport,

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000
 the AI created an official motto for it,

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:25.000
 and it was "Face the ball, to be the ball, and to be above the ball."

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000
 So good.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.000
 It's got a way to go.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000
 I'd listen to that AI commentating, actually.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.000
 That's great.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000
 Have you guys heard of juggling?

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.000
 Juggling.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.000
 Is it jogging and juggling?

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.000
 Yes.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000
 It's jogging and juggling together.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000
 You're a jogger, if you do it,

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.000
 and the championships are held every year at the International Jugglers Association Festival,

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.000
 and they're good.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000
 There is a three-ball event, there's a five-ball event,

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.000
 and a seven-ball event over different lengths,

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000
 and juggling five balls is unbelievably hard,

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000
 let alone seven, let alone seven while running,

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:04.000
 but get this, the 100-metre three-ball record is 14 seconds,

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000
 which is faster than I could run for 100 metres, not juggling.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000
 It's insane. It's absolutely insane.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000
 I wonder how many times, can you still be holding all three balls

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.000
 and just chuck one up in the air as you cross the finish line?

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.000
 Well, you've got to be continuous in juggling.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:18.000
 That's a great idea.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000
 You could get one and just chuck it 100 metres,

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000
 and then leg it to the other end.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:29.000
 I just have to quickly say that the top of this fact

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000
 was about Shakur attending the World Championships

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.000
 of Keeping a Balloon in the Air, the Balloon Championships,

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.000
 and I didn't say who won the championship.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.000
 So this year, this inaugural year, it was won by Peru,

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.000
 so just so everyone knows it was won by Peru.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.000
 The only reason I didn't say it is because I genuinely spent this entire time

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.000
 throughout this whole fact trying to work out what I'd actually written down,

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000
 because what I've got on my paper says, "One by Perv."

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:59.000
 I thought, "I can't be right."

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000
 Congratulations, Andy.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000
 Years of ball juggling practice to be a pretty good start.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.000
 Anyway, look, we need to wrap up.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000
 That is it. That is all of our facts.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000
