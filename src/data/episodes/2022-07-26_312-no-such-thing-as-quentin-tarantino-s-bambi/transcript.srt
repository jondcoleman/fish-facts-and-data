00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, and Anna Chazinski. And once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go. Starting with you, Andy.

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 My fact is that Pompeii's new drain system is 2,300 years old.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 Yeah, so this is in Pompeii. They have a set of storm drains underneath the city that were several meters down, so they weren't really affected when Vizuvius hit.

6
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Well, I don't think any storm drain would have been able to drain away from Vizuvius. That's a good point.

7
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Yeah, so the system, they're 450 meters long. They're quite big, so if you're a human you can crawl along it without too much discomfort. And it turns out they've been looked into. They're so clean and empty and well built that they're going to be used again for more of a purpose.

8
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 And they're looking into another stretch of 500 meters of drains just to see if we can open those up as well.

9
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 So this kind of system is for taking water that comes out of rivers or comes from the air and taking it down to the sea. It's not so much for sewage.

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Because this is what the Roman sewers were all about. If you had a toilet in your house, it would probably go into a cesspit.

11
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 It wouldn't be attached to the sewage system. Every now and then they could do. But the problem was there was no grating between the sewer and your toilet.

12
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 So if you had a toilet and you attached it to the sewer, everything could come the other way as well as you set this up.

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Oh, that's great. So that's why we know so much about their eating habits because they were just sitting in these cess pits.

14
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 There's all the menus. We've discovered things that they ate there. They include sea urchin, flamingo, and the only example of a giraffe leg in all of ancient Rome. It's found in Pompeii.

15
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 I think it's the shops that they found. Did they not look at the shops in Pompeii and they found all that stuff?

16
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 What do you mean they had it in the shop front with a giraffe leg on the window?

17
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 So obviously everything was kind of preserved quite well in Pompeii, right? Because of the old Vodka.

18
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 But they did a survey of 20 shops near Pompeii's gates and they looked at what was in the shops that was preserved.

19
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 They found, like Dan says, the shellfish and the giraffe's bone and also spices that came all the way from Indonesia.

20
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Wow. Because actually, if you reflect on it, it would have been weird if they'd found a full giraffe leg in the sewer that someone had excreted out.

21
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 That was in a painful session. That's a hell of a log.

22
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 They did used to be terrified of things leaping back up, didn't they?

23
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 And there used to be rumours that there were demons that would jump up from the sewers.

24
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Or giraffes. Or giraffes with only a leg remaining. And yeah, I think rats would crawl up quite often.

25
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 Yeah, well, there is one story. And this is from, I think, about the first century AD.

26
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 There was an author called Alien. Alien. It's an A-E-L-I-A-N, alright? He was not an alien.

27
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 He was a Roman historian, a racist guy. We're not certain.

28
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 But basically, all of these cesspit toilets that James has just mentioned, they were kept in the kitchen quite frequently of the house.

29
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 So you'd literally have the hob, and then next to it, you'd just have a little wooden toilet seat.

30
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 And you'd just do your business.

31
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 A convenient.

32
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 If you're in the middle of cooking a risotto, and you can't step away for too long, it's very convenient.

33
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 And I think a lot of people who are flats in London can really empathise with this.

34
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 I was going to say, in my father, that I used to live in, the toilet is basically in the kitchen.

35
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 It's at the end of the kitchen, and the door's never closed.

36
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Right. Well, that's disgusting. So...

37
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Why is the door, that's your decision?

38
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 You should close that door. It actually is quite annoying, because when you close it all, you can't open the fridge to access the freezer.

39
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 It's a really silly built system. It's quite bad design.

40
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 Sorry, if you've closed the toilet door, you can't open your own fridge.

41
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 The door handle gets in the way. It was a cock-up in the construction process that no one's ever remedied.

42
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Right, it's just stepping away from Anne's horrible life for a minute.

43
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 This, this author, alien.

44
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 He wrote about a merchant in a city, because they were all cesspit- they didn't really have traps.

45
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 You know, they didn't have any barrier.

46
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 So there was one merchant, wealthy Iberian merchant living in a city.

47
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 And every night, there was this giant octopus that would swim up his toilet,

48
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 and it would come out into the kitchen and eat all the pickled fish that he had in the pantry.

49
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 This is true! It's the story he wrote, obviously. It may not be completely true.

50
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 And also, it's written by Alien.

51
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 Just in Pompeii.

52
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 So we're finding out a lot more about it at the moment, because archaeologists keep digging up new things.

53
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 And one thing they've just discovered quite recently is that Pompeii in red, which is the walls,

54
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 or all if you go there, it's beautiful, stunning red, what turns out that it's the wrong colour.

55
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 A lot of that was yellow, and it was as a result of the gases from the volcano that it changed the colour.

56
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 So a lot of Pompeii was red, but not as much as it is now.

57
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 Well, that's like much of the rest of Pompeii doesn't have any colour on it anymore.

58
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 So I think in the amphitheater, it used to be covered in stunning frescoes

59
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 and sort of pictures of bull fights and chariot races and gladiators fighting each other.

60
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 And when it was excavated in 1815, so they excavated it, and that had all been perfectly preserved for almost 2,000 years.

61
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 And within a few months, it completely vanished, because as soon as it was being eroded and destroyed by frost and stuff, no trace of it was left.

62
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 So after 2,000 years, you just lift the lid on it and it goes away.

63
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 I have a fact about the amphitheater.

64
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 Pompeii men were so rowdy fighting the neighbours in their nearby town that their amphitheater got closed down for 10 years as a punishment.

65
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 Really?

66
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 Well, you mean like who looking this and stuff?

67
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 Yeah, exactly, yeah.

68
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 If I was in that 10-year ban from all sports.

69
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 Wow.

70
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 It's not a lot. It's your dream, isn't it?

71
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 Yeah.

72
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 In the amphitheaters, what were they been watching?

73
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 I think they were like gladiatorial people killing each other.

74
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 If you're not going to behave, you're not going to watch people murder each other.

75
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 You're only not going to murder each other in one place in the town.

76
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 Wherever you go and watch a sport, you don't automatically start doing that sport in the terraces.

77
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 You don't go to the horse race and then you turn around and all the crowd around horses.

78
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Every time I watch stand-up with Dan, he gets up in the middle of the audience and starts reciting his 8-year-old jokes.

79
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 It's really awkward.

80
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 When you say 8-year-old jokes, do you mean jokes that an 8-year-old will be proud of?

81
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 No, their jokes exclusively about 8-year-olds. That's what happens to real.

82
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 Do you know what people did when the volcano first erupted?

83
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 There was one day where it was raining small rocks from the sky.

84
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 It was clearly something had gone on and there had been an eruption.

85
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 Did they go to the volcano and look at it like Rubbernacket?

86
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 I don't think so, but the main thing that people did to protect themselves was to tie pillows onto their heads.

87
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 They just walked around with pillows on their heads all day.

88
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 How clever.

89
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 And then a lot of people actually got away. Most people who lived in the town escaped.

90
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 And then the next morning the pyroclastic flow came, which was thousands of miles an hour, I think.

91
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 And that just blasted anyone who was still left in bed.

92
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 And did the pillow do anything?

93
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 No.

94
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 The biggest pillow in the world.

95
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 You know how we've got the famous plaster casts of people, so you've seen them.

96
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 You've been having you down.

97
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 There's a famous shape, so the ash-covered bodies and then there's a bit hole where the body used to be.

98
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 But there's not just plaster casts of the bodies of the people.

99
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 There's also plaster casts of the plants.

100
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 So this is just a secondary very exciting thing that no one talks about.

101
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 But basically it's a really good way of finding out what they were growing in their gardens.

102
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 Because as well as covering the people, the ash-covered kind of all the plants and the trees and the herbs and stuff.

103
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 And it got into their root systems.

104
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 And then the roots disintegrate.

105
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 And they poured plaster in when they excavated.

106
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 And now they've got a perfect plaster cast of the root systems.

107
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 Oh, that's so cool. That's really cool.

108
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 Although I couldn't understand why they went for the humans first.

109
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 It was so clever just discovering a hole when realizing this is a person-shaped hole.

110
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 Do you think so?

111
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 Would you not think if you saw a hole that was in the shape of a person you would know immediately that it was?

112
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 No, I guess if I was just digging downwards, I wouldn't automatically think this is a shape like a person.

113
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 I guess it's how quickly you describe it.

114
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 Because I'm kind of imagining you remember that game show hole in the wall where celebrities had to make a shape and the shape of the body would come towards.

115
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 It wouldn't be quite as obvious as that would it?

116
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 I guess not.

117
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 Because you're excavating a whole plane of rubble and ash.

118
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 It's not a good game show.

119
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 And it's quite a dangerous place to go to Pompey still.

120
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 Yeah, for one bizarre reason, which is if you walk in the wrong spot, you might be blown up by a World War II bomb.

121
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 So it's unexploded bombs.

122
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 So this was in 1943.

123
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 The Allied forces had rumors come out that there was a lot of Nazis huddling up in Pompey.

124
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 Because actually I was going to say what's the point of bombing a place which has already been destroyed by a volcano?

125
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 Yes, it seems a bit like overcome, isn't it?

126
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 So that's what they thought they thought the Germans were there.

127
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 So these were rumors.

128
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 So they went over and they dropped 165 bombs over Pompey.

129
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 Exploding a lot of stuff.

130
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 But Nazis just had pillows on that.

131
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 8 to 10% of bombs that were dropped during the war said to be unexploded when they land in a spot.

132
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 So they actually have found a few while excavating looking for humans.

133
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 They suddenly come across.

134
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 Oh, that's a bit bomb shaped.

135
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 Or shaped people back there, aren't they?

136
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 Pretty much they weren't any Nazis hiding there.

137
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 So did they just drop a bunch of bombs?

138
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 It was completely wrong.

139
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 Yeah, it was completely wrong.

140
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 There was a few things like artillery and a few tanks.

141
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 But they definitely weren't people.

142
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 It wasn't a camp.

143
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 So yeah, so they found a few but they expect that there's about 10 in total to find.

144
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 And so they're finding it in all the spots that are not open to the public.

145
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 They're sort of the areas that they're now excavating.

146
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 There is a link between the bombings of Pompey and the eruption of Pompey

147
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 after another same day.

148
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 And in the same place.

149
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 And in the same place.

150
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 Really, at the same, really.

151
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 24th of August.

152
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 Wow.

153
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 Yeah, I don't know if that was chosen as a tribute text to the volcano.

154
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 I suspect not.

155
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 I suppose so.

156
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 All you can take from that data is don't go to Pompey on the 24th of August.

157
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 Absolutely.

158
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 Yeah.

159
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 And just because you mentioned bombs.

160
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 And to take it quickly back to latrines.

161
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 They used to explode sometimes.

162
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 So people in Pompey were used to the unexplosion.

163
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 So they could explode up your bottom.

164
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 You'd be sitting on the opening.

165
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 So you've probably seen the latrines in ancient Rome where you'd have public latrine.

166
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 And you'd sit on this hole and it was that key hole-shaped hole.

167
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 So you had a little bigger opening near the bottom so you could get your sponge brush in.

168
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 So you could wipe your bum with it.

169
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 But sometimes there'd be an explosion that would come up through that hole.

170
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 And that was because of the mixture of methane and hydrogen sulfide,

171
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 which caused explosions.

172
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 Wow.

173
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 Yeah, except fire.

174
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 You could always wear a pillow on your bottom when you go to the toilet.

175
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 Remind me not to come and stay at your place, Holmes.

176
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 All right, I've left a mint on your pillow.

177
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 Oh, God.

178
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 And also these public toilets.

179
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 It was like 20 at a time, wasn't it?

180
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 There was loads of people there.

181
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 And there was basically, there was no privacy.

182
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 It wasn't like cubicles or anything like this.

183
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 But you didn't really need it because you were wearing a toga.

184
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 So you could hide your shame by covering yourself in a toga.

185
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 Yeah, because we have this impression that they really didn't care.

186
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 And I guess I don't think they did care about privacy nearly as much as people did subsequently.

187
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 But there is one latrine that's been found with the revolving door.

188
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 Or what we think was revolving door.

189
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 That was the entrance to it.

190
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 You could do with one of those next to your fridge, couldn't you?

191
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 It's only.

192
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 This is actually based on like a hole in the ground.

193
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 They think they put a pole in and the door would just spin.

194
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 Because what people were doing when it was a normal door was just leaving the door wide open

195
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 because it's stacked like shit in there.

196
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 Right.

197
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 And they wanted to erase it.

198
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 But then people could just look in.

199
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 And so they included a revolving door so you couldn't leave it open.

200
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 But revolving doors, we've said before, they keep air in very effectively.

201
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 So would it smell worse?

202
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 Yeah, it probably would have smelled worse, but you couldn't leave it open.

203
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 You were just stuck with the smell, but at least you had your privacy.

204
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 Okay.

205
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 You've got to make a sacrifice.

206
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Sure.

207
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 We're going to have to move on in a sec to my next fact.

208
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 Have you heard of unblocked tober?

209
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 Or you go around unblocking people's toilets.

210
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 Is it a charity service?

211
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 Is it that you just don't eat meat so your stools are not quite as heavy?

212
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 It's not that.

213
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 Is that why people have had charian?

214
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 The sick of the heavy stools.

215
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 Shout out a writer ass like the others can't.

216
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 No, guys, it's to stop fat bugs and to stop a whole sewage system from being blocked up.

217
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 So they send you a resource pack for your workplace and home

218
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 and they advise you about how to improve the country's sewage.

219
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 And basically it's all things like not putting oil down the sink.

220
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 Because when the oil clubs together in the sewer, it creates a fat bug and it creates a nightmare.

221
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 And they send you a list of things not to throw down the sink or the toilet.

222
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 Like nappies, which I would have thought was quite obvious.

223
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 But the wet wipes and condoms and cotton buds and butter.

224
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 The butter is one of those things.

225
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 It is putting butter down the tile.

226
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 No one is, are they?

227
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 The only reason I could think of that is if you're buttering yourself up,

228
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 because you want to slip down there yourself.

229
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 To go and retrieve that wet wipe, you have to do your thing.

230
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 Okay, it's time for fact number two and that is James.

231
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 Okay, my fat this week is that there is a factory in Iran that makes 2000 US British

232
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 and Israeli flags every month specifically for people to burn.

233
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 Wow. How quickly after buying them, are you allowed to burn it?

234
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 Well, I don't think there are any rules in Iran against burning US flags.

235
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 I think it's positively encouraged.

236
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 But this was a report last month by AP, associated press, which was in old and newspapers afterwards.

237
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 And basically it's about this factory in a town that looks like it could be called Come In.

238
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 But I think it's probably called Hamin or something like that.

239
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 But it's in Iran and they have workers who work really diligently adding gold to stars

240
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 and the stripes and everything to all these flags, even though they know that as soon as they've made them,

241
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 they're just going to be set on fire.

242
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 And the guy who runs a factory has said in recent years a production of US flags has tripled.

243
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 And what eventually happens to my products is on its end user.

244
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 So he's kind of washing his hands of what happens to it afterwards.

245
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 But this company is called Diba, Parcham, Hamin and all I could find about them really is they have a nice Instagram channel.

246
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 Is it burning flags?

247
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 No, it's flags. It's unburning flags.

248
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 But no, I think this is what the owner is saying basically.

249
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 It's not up to me what people do there.

250
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 I'm not bothered. I'm just going to give you the flag.

251
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 And if you want to burn it, then that's up to you.

252
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 He did also say, I hope there is a day that the flags we produce are presented as a gift.

253
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 Which kind of feels true, although a lot of them are probably given as gifts today.

254
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 They're just given as gifts saying, hey, I know you want something to burn at the demonstration later.

255
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 But it's yeah, and they make three kinds of flags.

256
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 One is for display purposes.

257
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 One is tablecloth flags, which is if you have a conference or something.

258
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 And then the third is demonstration flags.

259
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 And that really spikes on days of national holiday, for example,

260
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 because you want an American flag to burn in a national holiday.

261
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 So you're not supposed to burn the tablecloth ones?

262
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 No, no, no, no. That's a ruin's adenopar sight.

263
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 Is the town where is the town where I told a comedy was born.

264
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 So that's why the town is called a comment or maybe why he was called comedy.

265
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 Yeah. And his house is now a major tourist site.

266
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 But it's not the it's not the only tourist site there because there are some caves nearby with some rock art

267
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 with cup marks, which may be up to 40,000 years old.

268
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 What? Yeah.

269
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 Well, I'm not completely sure what a cup market is.

270
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 So I'm always getting told off at home for putting my hot cup of tea on the table and leaving the mark.

271
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 And I'm always like, look, it'll erode eventually at the end.

272
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 But if you're telling me they're 40,000 years old,

273
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 Christ, they should have used the coaster.

274
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 Yeah.

275
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 It's funny, isn't it, how people burn flags and find it offensive and stuff,

276
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 considering that really no countries had flags until like the late 18th century.

277
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 And most countries didn't have them until the late 19th and early 20th century.

278
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 It's really a modern thing, the idea of national flags.

279
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 Yeah.

280
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 You would get them on boats and stuff, but as a country.

281
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 Well, a lot of countries are really into their flags.

282
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 So there are quite a few where the red stripe signifies the blood lost in war and stuff.

283
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 And quite a lot of countries don't allow you to burn them.

284
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 Whereas America is fine.

285
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 Well, America, they have a day for it, June 14th.

286
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 Absolutely.

287
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 It's the day that you retire flags.

288
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 So the idea is that you are meant to burn flags when they're over.

289
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 And there's an actual day that you can save the flag for.

290
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 So if you want to burn an American flag, June 14th, that's the day.

291
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 If you want to be respectful.

292
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 Absolutely.

293
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 If you want to offend everyone, do it any other day at the end.

294
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 Yeah, the day before.

295
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 Yeah.

296
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 They do say in the flag code, don't know, the US has a flag code.

297
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 And they say how to dispose of it, which is in a dignified way, preferably by burning.

298
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 But there are lots of other sites and lots of other companies,

299
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 which advise further on exactly how you should burn it.

300
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 And so places like the Boy Scouts or Flagsellers or the newspapers will say,

301
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 what you've got to do is you've got to fold your flag up very carefully.

302
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 Place it in the very middle of a fire.

303
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 Recite the pledge of allegiance and then observe a minute silence.

304
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 Limey.

305
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 How's it burns?

306
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 The Flagsellers say, and you must do that on the day after you buy it and then buy another one.

307
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 Have you heard of flag disposal boxes?

308
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 No.

309
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 These are a thing in America.

310
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 They are specific boxes for your old flags that have become worn or weathered.

311
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 And you drop them in there and every so often a boy scout will come around

312
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 and he'll open it up, take all the flags out and then burn them.

313
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 It's like a flag respectfully.

314
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 It's like a flag.

315
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 And they have these in supermarkets.

316
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 That's how big the flag is in the US.

317
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 So a flag basically like recycling, you have your clear glass and your brown glass.

318
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 And then your flag.

319
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 Yeah, exactly.

320
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 That's so specific.

321
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 A thing to have.

322
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 Yeah.

323
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 You think there could be one collection day a year where someone just goes around saying,

324
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 how many flags have you got through this year?

325
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 There are so many flags.

326
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 There are so many flags in America.

327
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 There's like wine bottles here.

328
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 We have the huge pile of wine bottles at the end of the week.

329
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 They've just got, I can't believe we went through so many flags this week.

330
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 Do you get a bit embarrassed putting out all these flags and all your neighbours seeing,

331
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 oh god, really went crazy last week.

332
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 We have a flag party.

333
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 We have a flag party.

334
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 You've got a flag problem, mate.

335
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 It did used to be illegal to burn the American flag, didn't it?

336
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 For quite a brief time.

337
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 So it was in 1968 when people were getting quite into it during Vietnam.

338
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 Quite into burning the flag in protest.

339
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 And it was made federal law that you couldn't do it.

340
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 And then in 1989, there was a guy called Gregory Lee Johnson who burned a flag.

341
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 It was like an anti-Ragan anarchist sort of protest.

342
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 And he said he should be allowed to burn it.

343
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 It was violating his free speech, his freedom of speech,

344
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 that he couldn't express himself by doing that.

345
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 And he won.

346
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 It was a quite a famous case, the Texas versus Johnson case.

347
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 He won.

348
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 And since 1989, it's been completely fine to burn the flag.

349
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 And what I found interesting was he's still going.

350
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 And he's still doing the same thing.

351
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 He's still flag burning all over America.

352
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 And in 2016, he, this guy, Gregory Lee Johnson,

353
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 was arrested during a staged flag burning at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland.

354
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 And the reason he was arrested, because obviously you can't be arrested for burning a flag,

355
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 is that police said that he lit his pants on fire.

356
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 And there's...

357
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 No, I didn't.

358
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 They went...

359
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 I liar.

360
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 Anyway, I just want to say in Gregory Lee Johnson's defence.

361
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 And again, it's all the news reports at the time.

362
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 He didn't lie to himself or anyone else on fire.

363
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 This was just like classic US police bullshit.

364
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 And he actually got a compensation of $225,000.

365
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 Hang on, Anna.

366
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 Did the boy scouts burn flags to dispose of them between 1960?

367
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 Whatever it was, 1969 and 1989?

368
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 They must have been a loophole.

369
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 Yeah.

370
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 So it wasn't for the purposes of this...

371
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 That was sort of allowed.

372
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 It must have been.

373
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 Unless maybe they had an enormous flag pile-up and didn't know what to do.

374
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 I mean, there might be a prison still with thousands of scouts in it.

375
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 They would all put away for life sentences.

376
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 They would have been able to get out of those scouts.

377
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 They've been trained.

378
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 This one, this badge is for escaping Alcatraz.

379
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 Just a quick thing on flags and protesting.

380
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 Have you guys heard of the Danish protest pig?

381
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 No.

382
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 No.

383
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 There's a pig that was basically bred in protests of the fact that

384
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 during the Prussian rule in Denmark, there was bits of Denmark

385
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 that were told they were not allowed to raise their flags.

386
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 So they bred a pig that had the exact colors of the flag

387
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 as a sort of walking flag.

388
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 Oh, red and white to the colors of the flag, right?

389
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 Yeah, exactly.

390
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 It's probably kind of pinky and white if it's a pig.

391
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 Yeah, it doesn't look like a flag when you see the pig.

392
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 I've seen pictures, but it obviously was just symbolic about it.

393
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 But yeah, that's amazing.

394
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 Yeah, it's just a nice little screw, yeah.

395
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 It's a relatively simple flag to replicate, I guess, as opposed to the...

396
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 Yeah, as opposed to the...

397
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 If you were the Seychelles flag.

398
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 Yeah, very hard to really do.

399
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 What's the Seychelles flag?

400
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 It's just got lots of colors on it.

401
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 Right, got it.

402
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 Thank you.

403
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 Everyone laughs if they all need a Seychelles flag.

404
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 I know.

405
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 That was guilty.

406
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 I'd assume it would be a...

407
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 Why would you pick it?

408
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 You've got to ask that you can't do the knowing laugh.

409
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 The people at home will be thinking, "Shit, maybe I should know the Seychelles flag

410
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 and they'll be hating themselves."

411
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 And then they'll look it up and laugh their ass off.

412
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 And they realise...

413
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 It's like lots of...

414
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 It's almost like rays of light coming up from the bottom corner and they're all different colors.

415
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 Yeah, in terms of we've got one on the wall right here at the Seychelles flag.

416
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 Why do you think that's where we're recording from this week?

417
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 And it's facing the wrong direction.

418
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 That's the one we're going to burn after the show.

419
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 That's right, yeah, yeah.

420
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 So another thing which people use for protesting against America is shoes.

421
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 Do you remember this?

422
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 This kind of started...

423
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 Oh, one of the first people to do this was an Iraqi reporter called Montaze Alzadi.

424
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 And he threw both of his shoes at George W. Bush in 2008.

425
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 And it was quite good for one person.

426
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 And that was the maker of his shoes.

427
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 And then started selling them as special by-by-bush models.

428
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 Amazing.

429
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 Did they come with grips so you could throw them better if George W. Bush visited you?

430
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 They were just the same shoes but they just renamed them.

431
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 And in fairness to him, the brother of the guy who threw the shoes said that actually he bought Iraqi-made shoes

432
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 and this company who was selling the by-by-bush ones was a Turkish company.

433
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 And apparently there was also a Syrian company who were claiming that they made the shoes.

434
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 But the Turkish ones was the one that took off and they had to get a whole lot of new workers into make shoes

435
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 because they were selling so many.

436
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 And yeah, he said that he saw it on TV and he said I know that shoe.

437
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 Anyway, that's definitely one of mine.

438
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 I wonder if people would treat the shoes afterwards because it's not like burning something.

439
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 Once you've thrown your shoe at someone, do you then go and pick it up and put it back on sale?

440
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 No, no, no.

441
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 Do you know what happens to the shoes?

442
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 To the ones thrown at George W. Bush.

443
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 Yeah, in a tree.

444
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 Were they taken by the Secret Service?

445
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 They were, but what does Secret Service do to them in Guantanamo Bay?

446
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 What about them?

447
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 You will talk.

448
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 You've got a tongue, you will talk.

449
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 No, they were and it's exactly what we were talking about with flags, they were burned.

450
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 Oh, really?

451
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 So that is one of the reasons why this Turkish company and the Syrian company and the Iraqi company

452
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 could all say that they made them because they'd been burned so no one knew exactly what they were.

453
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 Were they burned respectfully by a boy scout who had done up the laces first?

454
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 Tied them neatly.

455
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 Doesn't not.

456
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 There is a record for the biggest flag which is also a pizza.

457
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 Of course there is.

458
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 But was it flappet, it has to flap to be a flag?

459
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 This was actually just on a table.

460
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 This was a tablecloth.

461
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 It was the Stars and Stripes pizza,

462
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 which they made with mozzarella and then died mozzarella.

463
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 That's cheesy and I think they need to find a blue food.

464
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 They really tried and they just couldn't do it.

465
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 Blue M&Ms.

466
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 Blue M&Ms.

467
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 I think for the people who were ending up eating the pizza, I don't know if you can't put them to that.

468
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 But it was quite small, it was 9 feet by 4 feet.

469
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 Was the size of the overall flag slash pizza?

470
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 Yeah, that doesn't shock me that no one else has thought to make a pizza flag.

471
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 It's an easily breakable record though if you're looking to break a record.

472
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 That's what I'm saying.

473
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 Yeah, and go for a flag which is quite easy to do.

474
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 Yeah, not the same shell.

475
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 And that's what low enough about these people alone.

476
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is my fact.

477
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 My fact this week is that the old word for intestines was arse ropes.

478
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 Are we trying to bring it back?

479
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 I love it.

480
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 I think it's yeah, I think it's evocative, isn't it?

481
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 Yeah, the only issue is I don't talk about my intestines that much.

482
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 So it's sort of be a wasted swap.

483
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 If they were called arse ropes, you might.

484
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 I can bring them into every conversation.

485
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 So when was this?

486
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 This was in the 14th century.

487
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 So there's a great instance of it being included in the Wycliffe Bible,

488
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 which was one of the first modern translated English versions of the Bible.

489
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 By guy called John Wycliffe, I believe his name was.

490
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 No, Wycliffe, Sean.

491
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 I'm pretty sure.

492
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 I've had that name.

493
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 You might be right, he's right, I think.

494
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 There is a link between John Wycliffe and Wycliffe.

495
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 No.

496
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 Is there?

497
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 Yeah, Wycliffe, Sean was named after John Wycliffe.

498
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 Percy.

499
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 Yeah.

500
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 Yeah, there's a tweet of him online saying,

501
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 "My father named me after John Wycliffe, the biblical scholar."

502
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 That's amazing.

503
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 I know, but I don't know why you've reversed the names, John Wycliffe and Wycliffe, Sean.

504
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 Well, maybe his surname was Sean.

505
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 His surname happened to be Sean.

506
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 I thought this is an opportunity we can't miss.

507
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 I can't think of any other biblical scholars.

508
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 So I can open Martin Luther.

509
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 Was Martin Luther King named after Martin Luther?

510
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 He must have been.

511
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 Yeah.

512
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 Yeah.

513
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 I think people would have been called that because he was such a famous heroic figure.

514
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 Yeah.

515
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 Well, so was John Wycliffe.

516
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 He was great.

517
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 Look, so was Wycliffe, John.

518
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 Anyway, I think it was used to mean rectum, right?

519
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 Specifically, or I think I read an encyclopedia from a couple of hundred years ago

520
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 that was saying it was used to mean rectum and then they sort of referred to

521
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 the whole gut as being one continuous thing, which is in a way.

522
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 And the end of it, the end of the large intestine, the rectum,

523
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 was what they said for arse ropes.

524
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 And then they called the small intestines, the small ropes.

525
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 But it wasn't a rope.

526
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 I mean, it's not a rope.

527
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 You're bottom.

528
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 You can see, well, you can see, you know, if you open someone up,

529
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 you can see the ropes inside them of their intestines.

530
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 It's just so strange that they use that to mean your backside.

531
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 Well, it's still a tube.

532
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 I guess so.

533
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 You're both making really good points.

534
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 A couple more arse words from the olden days that obsolete.

535
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 Arse Poss was an obsolete word for a heavy fall on the buttocks.

536
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 Arse Poss.

537
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 Arse Poss.

538
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 Nice.

539
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 And arse winning was the money earned by prostitution.

540
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 Not a obsolete word.

541
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 Ah, that's good.

542
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 So Pratt was also talking about your bum and your hip.

543
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 And I'd never known that.

544
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 So Pratt fall is off because of that.

545
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 Did not know that.

546
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 I'd never read them.

547
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 When you call someone a Pratt, you're saying they're an arse.

548
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 Or a hip.

549
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 Yeah, it could be, it could be.

550
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 So just quickly, one more thing on John Weigler.

551
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 Yeah.

552
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 So he was kind of a proto-reformation person,

553
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 because he was an English scholar of the Bible, but he also disagreed

554
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 with a lot of standard Catholic church practices like selling indulgences

555
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 and praying to saints instead of just to God or to Christ.

556
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 And he was really unpopular in Rome for all these reasons.

557
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 So he died in 1384, really soon after his version of the Bible in English was published.

558
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 And then there was this church meeting called the Council of Constance,

559
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 which was 40-odd years later.

560
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 And they were so annoyed with him still at this church meeting

561
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 that they declared he should be dug up and his bones should be burned

562
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 and then thrown into the nearest river.

563
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 And it was done.

564
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 But was it unrespectfully?

565
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 It was a very, very disrespectfully.

566
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 Wow.

567
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 And they, that's harsh.

568
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 I know, this is harsh.

569
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 That Council of Constance, just quickly, they only met

570
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 because there was a really embarrassing church situation

571
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 where there were three popes at the same time.

572
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 That is a bureaucratic cock up, isn't it?

573
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 It's a sitcom rate again, isn't it?

574
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 Yeah, there were two from 1378 onwards.

575
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 And that was a bit embarrassing.

576
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 And then in 1409, player three entered the game.

577
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 It was pretending to be the fun.

578
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 So one of them was at least one of them was a pretender?

579
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 Yeah.

580
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 So the Council met to resolve this matter, and they did.

581
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 But they also said, let's dig up Whitecliffe,

582
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 while we're about, while we're all meeting, while we're here.

583
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 That's a bonding thing, maybe.

584
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 On intestines?

585
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 Yes.

586
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 It's quite a famous fact, the small intestines.

587
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 What's the surface area?

588
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 Oh, it's something like a tennis court.

589
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 A tennis court? It's not a tennis court.

590
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 Wow.

591
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 That's what you get taught at school all the time, right?

592
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 The small intestines, as it's incredible surface area

593
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 because it's covered in the little filly lumps and bumps.

594
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 And it's very windy.

595
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 And you're always told it's got a surface area of a tennis court

596
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 or a football pitch.

597
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 And then a few years ago, scientists realised

598
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 they've actually properly measured this.

599
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 So they bothered to measure the surface area of the intestines.

600
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 And that it was a bunch of Swedish scientists.

601
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 And they actually worked out it's only 40 square metres,

602
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 which is half the size of a badminton court.

603
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 Sorry guys.

604
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 It's pretty small.

605
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 Wow, that is small.

606
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 Yeah, I mean, it's still quite big to squeeze inside.

607
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 It's quite relatively small body.

608
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 That's true.

609
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 They did think for a while.

610
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 And I've not actually seen this disproven

611
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 that Russian people and Japanese people

612
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 had longer intestines than anyone else.

613
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 Okay.

614
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 So what it was, they measured some intestines

615
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 back in the olden days.

616
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 And they found that the Russian intestines

617
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 were about five feet longer on average

618
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 than anyone else in Europe.

619
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 And we think that probably the reason was,

620
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 is because they had quite a small sample size.

621
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 And actually, your intestines,

622
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 different people have different lengths.

623
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 And that is, you know, they're quite different in size.

624
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 And they think probably they just got lucky

625
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 that they got some Russians with big intestines.

626
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 But they blamed it on economic conditions,

627
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 saying that they lived on a vegetarian diet.

628
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 And so they needed to grow longer intestines

629
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 so they could eat all these vegetables.

630
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 Okay.

631
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 What?

632
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 Then, on the other hand, in Japan,

633
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 there is a theory thought by Japanese people

634
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 that Japanese people have longer intestines.

635
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 Okay. And I saw this really good article,

636
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 shame on me, I can't remember where it was,

637
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 where this person looked into this.

638
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 And they surveyed a load of Japanese students

639
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 and 65% of them believed that Japanese people

640
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 had longer intestines.

641
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 And four of the people who they asked said

642
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 that they were exactly 1.5 times anyone else in the world.

643
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 They had this belief is like a myth there.

644
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 But then this guy asked an actual doctor,

645
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 and this doctor said it's kind of known

646
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 in the field of, you know, cutting people up,

647
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 that if you get young Asian women,

648
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 they have extremely long intestines.

649
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 Okay.

650
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 And I just can't find any actual evidence of people

651
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 other than these people actually measuring them.

652
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 So for all I know, it's true.

653
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 And the idea is that if you're on a vegetarian diet,

654
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 or that kind of diet, you might, for some reason,

655
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 have longer intestines.

656
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 Now, obviously this does sound like bullshit.

657
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 Well, it is widely thought in some parts of the world

658
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 that that's true.

659
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 That that's true.

660
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 So koalas have really long intestines,

661
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 and they exclusively eucalyptus,

662
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 and they have to break that down a lot,

663
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 because it's quite poisonous eucalyptus.

664
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 But that's over millions of years.

665
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 So I don't know how quick it is.

666
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 It doesn't take the millions of years to break down

667
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 a bit of eucalyptus.

668
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 It takes a little hell of a lifespan.

669
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 No, you are right.

670
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 But it is definitely true that between individuals,

671
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 like my intestines might be way longer than yours

672
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 or way shorter.

673
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 Could they test it by presumably we could get, you know,

674
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 some Japanese people, some Russian people,

675
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 one of us to swallow something indigestible,

676
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 maybe some chewing gum or something,

677
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 and then we'll time how long it takes to come out,

678
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 and then whoever's probably just through CT scans

679
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 or, you know, just taking dead bodies in the open, maybe,

680
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 I don't know.

681
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 Just body testing.

682
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 I think bodies are coming out, but I would struggle to get the wherewithal

683
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 to cut open a dead body if we all tried it.

684
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 I thought arranging a CT scan was hard enough.

685
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 You know what?

686
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 I see what you're saying.

687
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 You're thinking of a practical way for us to do it,

688
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 because we know some Russians, we know some Japanese people,

689
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 we could try it.

690
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 I thought that could be a first step,

691
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 and then we'll think about the cadaver exhumation.

692
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 If that doesn't work.

693
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 Is that a thing, though, where we could race chewing gum?

694
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 No.

695
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 It's unlikely to be accepted for the Olympics 24.

696
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 What do you mean is that a thing?

697
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 There's a thing I just made up.

698
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 I was just wondering if there's a mean average speed of digestion.

699
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 There must be an average, but people must very, I suppose.

700
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 Because they've got five foot longer intestines.

701
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 Yeah, all you have in narrower tunnels,

702
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 so that your food might be pushed along it faster,

703
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 or take longer to get along it.

704
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 I'm not like Andy said, it's not a spectator spot really, is it?

705
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 It's not much of a one.

706
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 Let's find it a dinner party.

707
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 If you had a little GPS tracker inside the chewing gum, let's say.

708
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 Yeah, yeah.

709
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 Andy's making us red on there.

710
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 Yeah, he did it like a slalom ski route,

711
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 and you had it up on screens.

712
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 I can see that being fun.

713
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 They actually do that sort of thing now in medicine, don't they?

714
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 They send trackers down through your systems.

715
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 It's quite a common thing to swallow something.

716
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 And they've got a new thing, which is, you know how,

717
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 if you need to diagnose stomach issues,

718
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 sometimes they'll have to do an endoscopy

719
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 and you'll have to actually swallow something,

720
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 and it's quite uncomfortable, and then they'll scrape the mucus

721
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 from your stomach lining, and then it'll get a sample of mucus,

722
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 and it'll work out what's wrong with you.

723
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 And now they've invented, and I think it's going to be released

724
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 onto the markets in the next year or two,

725
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 sort of Hoover, which you swallow, and it does that for you.

726
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 So it's tiny little capsule, and you swallow it.

727
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 And it's got this amazing mechanism

728
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 where it's got an opening at the top,

729
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 which is clamped shut by a weird blob of wax.

730
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 But once it gets down to your stomach,

731
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 there's a magnet placed outside your body

732
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 that triggers an electric current that melts

733
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 that little wax pellet, so it opens the sack up,

734
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 and then the sack can hoover up all the mucus

735
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 in your stomach lining, and then it'll carry it out

736
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 like a little Hoover bag, and then you pull it out,

737
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 and you return the Hoover bag to the doctor.

738
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 You tell you what's wrong with you?

739
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 That is fucking clever.

740
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 That's weird. That's so cool.

741
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 You know bees, they have expandable rectums.

742
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 Do they? Don't we all?

743
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 Very good point. Very good point.

744
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 That's special.

745
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 Okay, bees have extremely expandable rectums.

746
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 How much? How expandable can they be?

747
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 Well, bees sometimes go into the hive for the winter.

748
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 And what they can do is they cannot have a poo

749
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 for several months, so some bees

750
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 just stretch out their rectums between November and March.

751
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 They just carry around all their poo

752
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 inside their bones for the last four months,

753
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 and then when March comes, when it's spring again,

754
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 they can leave the hive, and then they have a poo outside.

755
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 They take an enormous copy of war and peace

756
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 or something, and they say, "I'll be a couple of days."

757
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 Okay, it's time for our final factor of the show,

758
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 and that is Anna.

759
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 My fact this week is that researchers

760
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 have 3D printed sex dolls for turtles.

761
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 Do you think this is what?

762
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 Because this is what they do.

763
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 This was an article in the conversation

764
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 about a researcher who was pointing out

765
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 that we actually know surprisingly little

766
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 about how a lot of turtles mate,

767
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 and it's quite hard to study how they mate

768
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 without disturbing them, because you've got to go swim down

769
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 with your snorkel and mask and watch them.

770
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 And so what they've done is they've 3D printed decoys,

771
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 and so they've 3D printed these two decoy females,

772
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 and one of the things they were looking at was

773
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 what's attractive in a female to a male turtle,

774
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 so they printed one that was average size,

775
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 and one that was the very upper end,

776
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 the maximum size that a female could get to,

777
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 and they stick cameras on the turtles,

778
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 sink them to the bottom of a lake or a pond or a river,

779
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 and see what happens.

780
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 And it turned out the large one,

781
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 the big decoy, got twice as many visits

782
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 and five times as many mating attempts.

783
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 Wow.

784
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 It's a medium sized.

785
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 That's very cool.

786
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 These are map turtles, right?

787
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 Yes, and all the map turtles.

788
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 Yeah.

789
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 So they're really cool.

790
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 The reason that this 3D printing exercise work quite well

791
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 is because, to mate, they all gather together

792
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 into a massive orgy spot.

793
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 So this is every autumn, hundreds and hundreds

794
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 will get together at the bottom of a lake,

795
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 and then they'll have sex,

796
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 and then they'll sort of wedge themselves under a rock,

797
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 so they don't float away,

798
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 and they'll basically go to sleep for five months or hibernate,

799
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 and it's often under 50 centimeters of ice,

800
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 so they'll just be on the bottom,

801
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 and they don't breathe, well, they breathe through their skin,

802
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 they don't breathe through their mouths while they're doing that.

803
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 And they wake up in spring, first thing they do is mate again.

804
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 So they just have a long hibernation,

805
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 Wow.

806
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 where the bread is the mating,

807
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 but that's why.

808
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 And the filling is the sleeping.

809
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 Yes, yes.

810
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 It's a very big filling compared to the very thin slices

811
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 of mating bread.

812
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 I think you stretch this analogy enough.

813
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 I think it's willing to crack.

814
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 But anyway, that was why it was quite easy,

815
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 because you know exactly where to drop the decoys,

816
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 and there are plenty of them around,

817
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 and it's just really sad to watch if you've seen the videos

818
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 of the little guys trying to mate with the females.

819
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 It's just awful knowing that...

820
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 Yeah, it's just not going to get anything out of it.

821
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 There's so much awesome 3D printing stuff that's going on.

822
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 So some scientists, again, with turtles,

823
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 they've been making fake sea turtle eggs,

824
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 and then burying them on the beach.

825
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 Can you guess why?

826
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 Is it so that, because humans sometimes go and collect eggs

827
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 and try and steal them?

828
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 That's it.

829
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 It's to catch poachers.

830
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 Okay.

831
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 So you bury the fake eggs on the beach,

832
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 and then the poachers come along and steal the decoys,

833
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 along with the real eggs.

834
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 But the decoys have GPS trackers in,

835
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 so then you just map where they're all going to.

836
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 Wow.

837
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 And if eggs from two different GPS trackers end up in the same place,

838
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 you think there's your hub of poachers,

839
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 and you go there and make your arrests.

840
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 And if they accidentally eat the egg,

841
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 we can then play that game that I really want to do

842
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 with tracking the intestinal race.

843
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 Yeah, perfect.

844
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 I like the way that these people are poaching eggs.

845
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 Oh, yeah.

846
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 What is that?

847
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 So many people are wrongly imprisoned.

848
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 Did you poach an egg?

849
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 Yeah, I did.

850
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 Did you guys see spy in the wild?

851
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 I think it didn't.

852
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 But it was a series that made a load of fake animals

853
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 and then sent them into animal colonies.

854
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 In the first series of it, they made a fake langamunkey,

855
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 and then they sent it in to infiltrate a real langamunkey society,

856
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 and then 120 gathered around it,

857
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 and they were all really freaked out by this thing.

858
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 It looked exactly like one of them, but it was not quite right.

859
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 And then it fell over,

860
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
 because they were getting a bit boisterous around it,

861
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 and they all went really quiet,

862
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 because they thought, oh, no, we killed it.

863
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 Oh, no.

864
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 Terry's dead.

865
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 And then they all were really saddened

866
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 and started hugging each other.

867
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 Oh, I think it's the sign of emotion spreading among this group,

868
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 because they thought they'd accidentally oft.

869
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 How did they think they killed it just by staring it down?

870
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 Well, they nudged it and it fell over.

871
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 And it didn't move.

872
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 Yeah.

873
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
 It's so interesting.

874
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 So this was a guy he works at the BBC,

875
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 or four of the BBC with these programs,

876
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 called John Downer,

877
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
 and he made a series ages ago

878
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 where he didn't quite do animals.

879
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 He put cameras in boulders.

880
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 He had boulder cam, basically.

881
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 And they thought that worked so well.

882
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 Why don't we try and make animatronic animals?

883
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
 So they did a prairie dog.

884
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
 They did a walking crocodile.

885
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
 They did a female orangutan.

886
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 And with each one, they gave them a very specific trait

887
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 that would help them survive in the wild.

888
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 So like the prairie dogs,

889
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
 the animals have, they kiss each other a lot,

890
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 and so they have that ability to do that.

891
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 And there's a thing called the jump-yip,

892
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 which is a way of bonding.

893
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 And so they were able to make this do a jump-yip.

894
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 Cool.

895
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 So they took all these traits.

896
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 Yeah, there was a spy pufferfish that they used.

897
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 It's an incredible series.

898
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 There were mere cats smeared in feces.

899
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
 That's right.

900
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 Because they try to make it smell like the other mere cats

901
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 by collecting their poo

902
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 and then smearing the animatronic one with it.

903
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 There was a bee with a pile of poo in its bum.

904
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,000
 Have you had of these decoy deer they have?

905
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
 I'm not sure if these are 3D printed.

906
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 In fact, I think they are kind of made by engineers

907
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 and by sort of hunting experts.

908
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 But this is another way of leering poachers.

909
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 So this happens in Washington State

910
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 and various different bits of the USA.

911
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
 Because finding poachers is unbelievably hard to do

912
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
 because what you need is you need a wild animal

913
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 and a poacher and a law enforcement officer

914
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 all to be in the same place at the same time.

915
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 Which is really hard. It's a nightmare.

916
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 So they've started making these dummy deer

917
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
 and then putting them out in fields.

918
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
 And that liars the poachers to them.

919
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 But you also, whenever you put the deer out,

920
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 you just have a wildlife officer who sits near it

921
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 and waits for someone to pop up and shoot it.

922
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
 And they've made them so good

923
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
 that they can now turn their heads these fake animals

924
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 or lift their legs.

925
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
 Nice.

926
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 And so a deer costs about $3,000 to make $3,000 to produce.

927
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
 Right.

928
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 Because you need an animal skin

929
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
 and you need some mechanics.

930
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
 So you need to kill a deer first.

931
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 So you killed a deer?

932
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 We need to get the skin off it.

933
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 You hire a poacher to kill you then.

934
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 But once you've got that in place,

935
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 you can make $30,000 in fines, finding poachers.

936
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 Yeah, that was one where they put it out.

937
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
 Within five minutes, a poacher turned up and tried to shoot it.

938
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 Yeah.

939
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 Because I was thinking, how do you guarantee a poacher's going to find it?

940
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 You could be sitting there for weeks.

941
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 Would you put it near a road?

942
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 That's quite helpful because obviously they'll see it.

943
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
 And they'll, you know, they might stop the car

944
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
 and try and have a crack at it.

945
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 They're not allowed to.

946
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
 It's a season or something.

947
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 So yeah.

948
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
 And they can be shot a hundred times without breaking some of them.

949
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 Really?

950
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 Yeah.

951
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
 It's going to make the poachers suspicious.

952
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
 90th gun shot.

953
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
 That's going to make that version of Bambi very long, isn't it?

954
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
 [LAUGHTER]

955
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
 Such a traumatic scene, that would be.

956
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
 Bambi made by Tarantino.

957
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 Yeah.

958
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 [LAUGHTER]

959
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
 And I love decoy animals.

960
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
 I, like, all the ways that scientists use them.

961
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
 And I was looking at probably, like, the most kind of well-known,

962
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,000
 maybe widely used decoys, the duck decoy, the classic hunters.

963
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 They had taken out ducks for hundreds of years because you plant a flock of fake ducks on a pond

964
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
 and then the real ducks flock to it.

965
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 And so I thought I'd look into this.

966
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
 First of all, I didn't realise how many you had to bring out.

967
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 So when you went on a duck hunt in, you know, 1700s, 1800s,

968
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
 then you wouldn't just take a couple of wooden carved duck decoys.

969
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
 You had to mimic a flock.

970
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 So on your hunt, you'd take up to 500 cars.

971
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
 [LAUGHTER]

972
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 I love it.

973
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
 500?

974
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 No way.

975
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
 You could have plot this massive flock on your pond.

976
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
 [LAUGHTER]

977
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 To catch one duck.

978
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
 [LAUGHTER]

979
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 I don't know how they ever made a profit.

980
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
 Doesn't make any sense.

981
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
 [LAUGHTER]

982
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
 To be fair, if I was a duck and I saw a party with 500 prints,

983
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
 I'd immediately want to join it, yes.

984
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
 Exactly.

985
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 And then you also had to have live decoy ducks with the 500.

986
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
 Oh, stop.

987
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
 Live decoy.

988
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
 Well, because they have to make the realistic cool.

989
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
 So you'd have 500 quiet ducks made of wood.

990
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
 And then you'd have to have a couple of live ones that they keep on a lead,

991
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
 sort of in amongst them, to make the noise.

992
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 Yes, all of those.

993
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
 Uncrew.

994
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
 Doesn't it?

995
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
 It's pretty sinister as well for the two ducks in the middle of these 500 dummies.

996
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
 Luring their mates and their deaths.

997
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
 Yeah.

998
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
 That's incredible.

999
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
 It's a rough gig.

1000
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
 We should wrap up soon, right?

1001
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
 OK.

1002
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
 Just a quick thing on turtles, tortoises.

1003
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 So you guys read that Diego, the Hood Island tortoise,

1004
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
 is retired from shagging, finally.

1005
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
 Finally.

1006
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
 This is the recent news.

1007
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
 This is this year.

1008
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
 So Diego is a Hood Island tortoise.

1009
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:49,000
 And they were tortoises who, in the 1960s, they realised that there were only three males left.

1010
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
 And I knew about a dozen females left on a Galapagos island.

1011
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
 And so they started a breeding programme.

1012
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
 So there's about 50 years ago.

1013
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
 And so they had these three tortoises.

1014
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
 And they tried to make the mate and Diego has mated.

1015
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
 And he's now produced about 800 offspring.

1016
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 And this other one, even better than him, has produced about 1200 offspring.

1017
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
 Wow.

1018
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
 The third one just didn't do any.

1019
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
 It was just really shit.

1020
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
 And Diego is just retired and he's hit the headlines.

1021
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
 And I find him really interesting.

1022
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
 Because first of all, like well done him, he's shagged all these tortoises.

1023
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
 He's repopulated the Galapagos with this type of tortoise.

1024
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
 But also he's super famous.

1025
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
 And the one who's done more shagging and is still going, is not that famous.

1026
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
 And I was really an interview with one of the professors who works on it.

1027
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
 And he was speculating.

1028
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 He was speculating. He was saying, so the other one who's actually signed 60%.

1029
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
 He's called E5.

1030
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
 So not as good a name.

1031
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
 And the shit one was called E3.

1032
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
 And so a bit rubbish.

1033
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
 And also apparently he's more reserved and less charismatic.

1034
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:54,000
 Well, Diego is also an exhibitionist, which you probably would expect with the name as well.

1035
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
 So he shags very loudly and very aggressively.

1036
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 And does it in the daytime so you can see him.

1037
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
 Whereas E5, sort of no one's really seen him mating very much.

1038
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
 They think maybe he does it at night and he's a bit quiet about it.

1039
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
 And so he's just apparently not as a bigger personality.

1040
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:15,000
 And we know, the only reason we know is that he had a paternity test on every single of the new tortoises.

1041
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
 2000 paternity tests.

1042
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
 Amazing episode of the Jeremy Kyle show.

1043
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:26,000
 We'll be showing the results for the next four seasons of the show.

1044
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
 We'll start moving towards each other really slowly to have a fight.

1045
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:38,000
 Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts.

1046
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
