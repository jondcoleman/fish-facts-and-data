00:00:00,00:00:20,"""Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:20,00:00:23,to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.
00:00:23,00:00:28,"My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, Anatozhinsky"
00:00:28,00:00:33,and James Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite
00:00:33,00:00:37,facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.
00:00:37,00:00:39,"Starting with James."""
00:00:39,00:00:45,My fact this week is that hagfish can eat by sitting inside the dinner and absorbing
00:00:45,00:00:48,the nutrients through the skin.
00:00:48,00:00:50,It isn't that amazing.
00:00:50,00:00:54,Wouldn't that be incredible if you could just sit inside your curry and just eat the food
00:00:54,00:00:55,like that?
00:00:55,00:00:59,Maybe some foods it would be worse for or messier for.
00:00:59,00:01:00,Go on.
00:01:00,00:01:04,"The way if you have to get inside a sausage before eating it, do you think you're very big"
00:01:04,00:01:05,outside?
00:01:05,00:01:08,I think it's going to be messy almost whatever food you're climbing inside.
00:01:08,00:01:09,You're true.
00:01:09,00:01:13,I think with a sausage you might just rub it against your skin rather than climbing
00:01:13,00:01:14,and strapping it.
00:01:14,00:01:15,Strap the sausage to yourself.
00:01:15,00:01:16,I think so and then it'll only absorb it.
00:01:16,00:01:18,That's what I would do if I was a hagfish.
00:01:18,00:01:19,That's a good idea.
00:01:19,00:01:22,I'd like to see a hagfish eating a sausage because they look a bit like a long sausage.
00:01:22,00:01:26,You wouldn't know what was going to be what.
00:01:26,00:01:29,"I should probably explain what a hagfish is, shouldn't I?"
00:01:29,00:01:36,It kind of looks like an eel and it is most famous among people on the internet for creating
00:01:36,00:01:39,loads and loads of slime.
00:01:39,00:01:40,That's what they do.
00:01:40,00:01:44,Basically when they're threatened they create this incredible amount of slime and it stops
00:01:44,00:01:46,them from being able to be eaten.
00:01:46,00:01:49,But the way that they eat they have a few different ways of eating.
00:01:49,00:01:54,"They can rasp things with their tongue, they've got extremely hard tongues that can rub against"
00:01:54,00:01:59,some meat and bring it into the digestive system or they can actually just absorb it through
00:01:59,00:02:00,their skin.
00:02:00,00:02:04,Actually weirdly enough the skin one is a slightly better way of them getting nutrients.
00:02:04,00:02:05,It is.
00:02:05,00:02:06,It is bizarre.
00:02:06,00:02:10,It is better for them to absorb food or they can do it faster or more effectively.
00:02:10,00:02:11,They can do it so much.
00:02:11,00:02:12,They can do it more efficiently.
00:02:12,00:02:13,You know what I thought?
00:02:13,00:02:14,I was thinking about this.
00:02:14,00:02:16,Why don't we all just absorb food through our skin?
00:02:16,00:02:18,Why do we have it through our stomach?
00:02:18,00:02:23,I don't know if this is right but I did wonder if maybe if you eat a sandwich and it goes
00:02:23,00:02:28,"inside your stomach then no one else can get at it once it's in your stomach, you're"
00:02:28,00:02:29,new to eating it.
00:02:29,00:02:32,But if you sell it to your face then someone might be able to come and steal it off you
00:02:32,00:02:35,so maybe that's one reason why it's better to eat stuff.
00:02:35,00:02:36,That's what I was thinking.
00:02:36,00:02:39,If you were sort of sat next to them you could just stick your finger in it and like a straw
00:02:39,00:02:40,just suck at it.
00:02:40,00:02:42,I don't think that's the reason.
00:02:42,00:02:43,Can I just suck at it?
00:02:43,00:02:45,I don't think that's the reason the stomach evolved.
00:02:45,00:02:46,Is it not?
00:02:46,00:02:51,I don't think it is a size thing and that size thing.
00:02:51,00:02:56,So for example some very small organisms can absorb oxygen directly through their skin
00:02:56,00:03:02,even some tiny frogs but larger animals have such a large volume in relation to the skin
00:03:02,00:03:04,area they have that it's inefficient for them to do that.
00:03:04,00:03:08,"It wouldn't be possible to absorb all the, so I think humans might need so many calories"
00:03:08,00:03:13,a day that you couldn't absorb you know 20 sausages a day through your skin.
00:03:13,00:03:18,I know I'm going to email Ed Young and ask him because I read this fact in an article in
00:03:18,00:03:24,the Atlantic written by Ed Young and by the way if you have like a few hours or a day or
00:03:24,00:03:28,a week to spare go on the internet and search for Ed Young and read everything that he's
00:03:28,00:03:31,ever written because he's a brilliant science writer.
00:03:31,00:03:36,Oh it's heaven to read his articles yeah so true such a good shout go and read that.
00:03:36,00:03:41,What do they eat by the way is it dead sharks or is it seeds right in this case yeah in
00:03:41,00:03:45,this they can eat lots of different things but in this case where they're sitting inside
00:03:45,00:03:49,something has to be something a lot bigger than them and so it'll be like Anna says probably
00:03:49,00:03:52,whale carcasses or something like that.
00:03:52,00:03:55,So they don't have a lower jaw that's the other thing about them they've only got upper
00:03:55,00:04:01,teeth because they're quite badly put together animals and the only way they can bite something
00:04:01,00:04:05,is they can tie themselves in knots really easily and they tie a knot at their tail and
00:04:05,00:04:10,then they work the knot all the way along their body until it gets to where the lower
00:04:10,00:04:15,jaw would be and that provides a lower surface for them to squeeze their upper jaw against.
00:04:15,00:04:21,I mean they're really so awkward for saying they also use the knots actually for scraping
00:04:21,00:04:26,themselves free of slime don't they when they eject all the slime they knot themselves
00:04:26,00:04:30,up and they've got a knot at their head and they'll pull the knot down to the tail to lose
00:04:30,00:04:31,the slime.
00:04:31,00:04:32,It's multi-purpose knots.
00:04:32,00:04:37,The slime is a real headline I mean the the absorbing stuff is good but the amount of
00:04:37,00:04:39,slime that they make is incredible.
00:04:39,00:04:43,It's amazing and the slime that they produce the way that it expands at the rated expands
00:04:43,00:04:45,is just insane.
00:04:45,00:04:50,"So Jung puts in the article that it can expand by 10,000 times in the fraction of a second"
00:04:50,00:04:56,and there's been cases of that very famous photo actually online of a truck of hagfish
00:04:56,00:05:02,overturning and covering an entire car and slime the entire road just slime everywhere
00:05:02,00:05:04,in a second.
00:05:04,00:05:07,We should say that it's not although the main purpose of this slime is so that they can go
00:05:07,00:05:15,viral on the internet it has a self purpose of being a very useful protective device so basically
00:05:15,00:05:21,it's not a single predator with gills is able to consume them because they would be quite
00:05:21,00:05:25,easily consumable otherwise because they eject this slime and immediately it clogs up
00:05:25,00:05:29,all of a predator's gills so if you're a shark or something your gills are suddenly clogged
00:05:29,00:05:33,up you can't breathe anymore and we don't know there's a lot we don't know about hagfish
00:05:33,00:05:38,but we don't know if this actually kills them because we've seen videos of them get clogged
00:05:38,00:05:42,up and they swim away and then we don't really know how they'll get the slime off.
00:05:42,00:05:45,So they're safe from any predators with gills.
00:05:45,00:05:51,It's mostly water the slime isn't it is 99.996% water and each time they release a bucket
00:05:51,00:05:58,s worth of slime or a jug of slime it's only 40 milligrams of actual stuff that they
00:05:58,00:06:03,are giving off from their body mucus and proteins is almost none but it reacts so quickly
00:06:03,00:06:07,with the water that it generates this massive amount otherwise it would be the slime they
00:06:07,00:06:10,would have to have this massive slime tank inside them.
00:06:10,00:06:14,The amount they have inside them is extraordinary in terms of the fibers that then turn into
00:06:14,00:06:19,the slime so it's sort of two toned slime production equipment they've got these lengths
00:06:19,00:06:24,of fibers in their body and then they've got some mucus and the length of fiber in their
00:06:24,00:06:28,"body the total length is 20,000 kilometers of fiber."
00:06:28,00:06:34,So and it comes in these 15 centimeters long threads so lots of these little threads coiled
00:06:34,00:06:38,up in these tiny little storage boxes inside their body so the thread that means that the
00:06:38,00:06:44,threads are essentially 10 million times longer than they are wide I think and just coiled
00:06:44,00:06:45,up.
00:06:45,00:06:48,I read one explanation of this you might have read the same thing Anna which is it's the
00:06:48,00:06:54,same as stuffing one kilometer of Christmas lights into a shoe box with that single
00:06:54,00:07:00,knot or tangle that's because the slime glands are so small and these threads are so numerous.
00:07:00,00:07:05,Well they're big generally the skin on them so there was a study that was done that was
00:07:05,00:07:10,showing that in a lot of cases the slime that they released to predators let's say to clog
00:07:10,00:07:14,their gills is actually released after their bitten and they try to work out how they
00:07:14,00:07:19,survive after their bitten and it turns out that the metaphor they use is basically their
00:07:19,00:07:25,skin is like really loose pyjamas like they're just so flabby with extra skin that if you
00:07:25,00:07:30,injected them with the same volume of stuff that's in them you could get 40% more of them
00:07:30,00:07:33,into them before their skin starts to stretch that's how loose they are.
00:07:33,00:07:38,Yeah they're like exhausted with a very massive skin and it's only attached in a few places
00:07:38,00:07:43,as well as again so that they can avoid being bitten if they get bitten the shark is mostly
00:07:43,00:07:48,biting skin really yeah and they've also they're the bloodiest animals on the planet
00:07:48,00:07:55,or close to it so there's 17 milliliters of blood per 100 grams of mass which is a lot.
00:07:55,00:08:01,At least twice as much as any other fish I think and also apparently they maybe have the blood
00:08:01,00:08:05,because they need something to fill the space between their flesh and their skin they just
00:08:05,00:08:08,got to put some liquid in there so they're like well I guess I'll make more blood to fill
00:08:08,00:08:14,myself up that's so weird it seems so inefficient as a fish to have a loose set of pyjamas
00:08:14,00:08:23,on. What's going on with the name I wonder? Hagfish because they're not which is snow no I just
00:08:23,00:08:28,wonder if there's any link between that and Hagrid which is a you know that's a word for
00:08:28,00:08:33,bedeviled by witches isn't it or that was the origin of the name Hagrid yeah I think it's just it
00:08:33,00:08:39,goes back to the 1603 or something it's really what quite a long time and it is just because they
00:08:39,00:08:44,thought they were ugly although it would have been a worse series of books if a giant Hagfish
00:08:44,00:08:52,had turned up and slimed Harry Potter. How are you choking? A Hagfish in Harry Potter would
00:08:52,00:08:57,absolutely turn the figure lights wouldn't it? It would be brilliant. It does seem like a missed
00:08:57,00:09:03,opportunity for a great superhero the Hagfish just I can't believe I mean it's amazing that this
00:09:03,00:09:08,is the one fish that nothing can eat. Well no no anything with our gills can eat it. Yeah of course
00:09:08,00:09:13,it's going to eat it happily. South Koreans can eat it. Obviously that gills that's one of the
00:09:13,00:09:18,first things everyone knows about people in South Korea. Yeah they huge popular there they eat about
00:09:18,00:09:23,was it five million pounds of Hagfish meat every year. Wow and you get Hagfish wallets? You do don't
00:09:23,00:09:28,you. Those have a very useful adaptation because obviously if someone tries to mug you it immediately
00:09:28,00:09:35,sweats. This is a gloop and the mugger it's unable to actually grip your wallet. It's called
00:09:35,00:09:40,Is eel leather isn't it I think. So if you've got anything this eel skin leather is actually
00:09:40,00:09:45,hagglish and apparently I read somewhere that it's sort of as a more ethical alternative to
00:09:45,00:09:51,actual leather. I think on the ethical hierarchy maybe it's sort of as more ethical to get some Hagfish
00:09:51,00:09:57,than some cow or whatever but say go if you think that's more ethical you should have the Hagfish what?
00:09:57,00:10:02,It sounds like you don't think it's more ethical. I covered my mind Andy I don't have an opinion
00:10:02,00:10:07,we just present the facts and we let other people draw their conclusions. Does anyone know
00:10:07,00:10:13,how Hagfish have sex? Do they tie themselves in knots? Actually Anna's right nobody knows.
00:10:13,00:10:20,That was the question. Does anyone know how long Hagfish live? It's seven years.
00:10:20,00:10:28,No again nobody knows how long Hagfish live. Does anyone know why 90% of them appear to be female?
00:10:28,00:10:35,Another no. It's not interesting like of all the Hagfish that we caught 90% of them are female
00:10:35,00:10:40,and we don't really know why. It might be that 90% of them are female or it might be that the
00:10:40,00:10:45,females are easier to catch we don't really know. All that they're all homophrodites but when they
00:10:45,00:10:50,sense they're about to be caught they throw away their penises. That's equally well. I mean it's
00:10:50,00:10:58,all equally likely. So supposedly it's really hard to find their eggs and I think this is a bit like
00:10:58,00:11:03,do you remember we talked about eels and how hard it is to find their gonads but it's supposedly in
00:11:03,00:11:09,the 20th century scientists found a total of three Hagfish embryos and that was it because they live
00:11:09,00:11:17,really deep down. Before that there was one man called Bashvardin and in 1896 he found 800 eggs
00:11:17,00:11:25,including 150 embryos and he is the kind of hero of Hagfish research but he had two main interests
00:11:25,00:11:31,"in life. One of them was Hagfish and Zoology and the other was armour, military armour and when he"
00:11:31,00:11:37,wasn't collecting Hagfish embryos he was obsessed with collecting medieval armour. He started bidding
00:11:37,00:11:44,in auctions age 9 for medieval stuff and anyway he became a... He was getting too much pocket money
00:11:44,00:11:48,if that's the age you're bidding in. He did get outbid. He got outbid in his first few but he
00:11:48,00:11:54,he was he became a museum curator and was it immensely well regarded in his field and then the first
00:11:54,00:11:58,World War happened and absolutely all the work he'd done over his life paid off because he started
00:11:58,00:12:06,designing helmets based on medieval military armour because the US Army needed a metal helmet basically
00:12:06,00:12:11,that would stop bullets and he designed several prototypes. One of them was designed exactly on a 15th
00:12:11,00:12:17,century Italian knights helmet so it looks like a proper full face visor with a tiny slit for the
00:12:17,00:12:22,eyes and that was being built in the 20th century because of Bashvardin. So we used medieval helmet
00:12:22,00:12:27,designs for the First World War because I thought we'd moved on from then. Well it was for people that
00:12:27,00:12:31,that particular one was for people who were in a forward position say they were in an extremely
00:12:31,00:12:36,dangerous environment and they needed lots of protection for a short space of time because it was so
00:12:36,00:12:41,heavy this helmet that it made the helmet weighed six kilos alone. Sorry can I just ask when you say
00:12:41,00:12:46,he found these 10 million embryos or whatever and we've only ever found three where are we finding them?
00:12:46,00:12:54,What's it not at Southern Beasts when he was ten years old? He's surprised the story is that he
00:12:54,00:12:58,collected them from fishermen who had been dangling lines with bait on them and I don't know why
00:12:58,00:13:04,that couldn't then be just done again but we think maybe they hide their eggs on the floor of the ocean
00:13:04,00:13:10,or that yeah so there are lots of theories. Do you guys know the US Navy's been experimenting with
00:13:10,00:13:16,hagfish in warfare? Hmm what's it well for the slime thing off are they getting nutrients? For the slime
00:13:16,00:13:23,thing. So using the soldiers to climb inside a whale corpse? No not that yeah I'm sure that's on
00:13:23,00:13:29,the card so they have been trying to use the slime as a non-lethal way of stopping these boats and
00:13:29,00:13:34,destroying them by chucking it at the propellers of the boats so if you can slime up the propellers
00:13:34,00:13:38,you would stop their rotors from turning and you would disable the ship entirely. I know they're
00:13:38,00:13:43,going to extract the slime from hagfish separately or do you just get a big tub of hagfish and then
00:13:43,00:13:48,shock it at the end of it when they can't do it. Yeah you feel like that could be just that right like
00:13:48,00:13:52,it's they produce so much but no I think they're synthesizing it I think they're turning it into
00:13:52,00:13:56,something different. Yeah what they do is they put the jeans that create hagfish slime into
00:13:56,00:14:02,E. coli bacteria and then the bacteria can create the slime themselves so you can do it on a
00:14:02,00:14:07,larger sort of manufacturing scale. Seriously yeah nice that feels. And without scraping thousands of
00:14:07,00:14:12,hagfish off the floor of the ocean I suppose. It's more ethical I would say. It's pretty more
00:14:12,00:14:17,ethical yeah the bacteria don't think so James. No you're right who will speak for the bacteria if
00:14:17,00:14:26,not Alan Tishinsky the bacteria spread. Okay it is time for fact number two and that is my fact
00:14:26,00:14:33,my fact this week is that 1982's time person of the year was the personal computer. The article
00:14:33,00:14:40,announcing it was written on a typewriter very bizarre. Yeah so this is obviously time have the
00:14:40,00:14:44,tradition of doing person of the year and this was the first year in which they did machine of the
00:14:44,00:14:48,year they stepped away from person of the year and they gave it to the computer but the time
00:14:48,00:14:54,offices in 1982 were still running almost entirely on typewriter as they wouldn't upgrade their
00:14:54,00:14:59,systems for another year so they were behind the times with their own person of the year.
00:15:00,00:15:06,Was it do we think it was a hint to the owners you know making it first of the year? Guys we still
00:15:06,00:15:11,don't have one of these fuckers okay. The article was quite interesting because it referenced Apple's
00:15:11,00:15:17,first personal computer which was called Lisa but Steve Jobs was really annoyed about it and that's
00:15:17,00:15:22,because he expected to be named person of the year that year and so he was really annoyed that
00:15:22,00:15:27,the computer got his title and he was also annoyed because it said that he had a data named Lisa
00:15:27,00:15:32,but he denied paternity of that data so he was just ultra pissed off with that. He was really bad
00:15:32,00:15:38,in that article. Steve Jobs the way he denied the paternity he said that 28% of the male population
00:15:38,00:15:42,of the United States could be the father of this child deemed unlikely though but they have to
00:15:42,00:15:49,say unlikely yeah. Why did he say that? He took a paternity test which showed that there was 94%
00:15:49,00:15:53,chance that it was his game time. Oh I see because the way that you said it sounded like he was
00:15:53,00:16:00,been unbelievably misogynistic about his ex part. That's true. Slept with all like pretty much
00:16:00,00:16:05,every sexually active man in the entire country. That's so true I should have yeah I should have
00:16:05,00:16:09,qualified. That's absolutely what I took it as but that's not necessarily a negative that's
00:16:09,00:16:14,actually incredibly impressive. That's what he meant. So time person of the year is an interesting
00:16:14,00:16:19,concept and also has not been time person of the year for very long so in fact at this time when
00:16:19,00:16:23,it was time computer of the year it wasn't replacing the time person of the year tradition it was
00:16:23,00:16:29,time man of the year. So it only got changed to time person of the year I think in 1999 before that it
00:16:29,00:16:36,was always time man of the year except we should say three crucial occasions since the 1920s when an
00:16:36,00:16:42,individual woman got time woman of the year. So Wallace Simpson got it 1936 and that was obviously
00:16:42,00:16:47,because she's shagged up shagducking. And then in 1981 it was that woman who had sex with a hundred
00:16:47,00:16:57,million men in America wasn't it? We were just so impressed. Between 1927 and 1999 when they
00:16:57,00:17:02,changed it to person of the year individual woman won it the same number of times as Franklin D.
00:17:02,00:17:08,Roosevelt the US president. Wow yeah. That's correct. Three is yeah. It was it was it was Queen Elizabeth
00:17:08,00:17:13,as you say Wallace Simpson and the president of the Philippines. But it's not always good to get
00:17:13,00:17:19,you know if you get it doesn't mean it's a mark of high standards. No no no and I think the point is
00:17:19,00:17:22,because I think people have said this is a sexist award and it's not time magazine is just
00:17:22,00:17:28,reflecting who has power and influence and what it reflected was that women had no power and
00:17:28,00:17:34,influence and shamefully the third person who got it was Karazan Akino who was president of the
00:17:34,00:17:39,Philippines who I knew nothing about but who was a definite good guy and what she did she over
00:17:39,00:17:45,through Ferdinand Marcos I established kind of democracy in the Philippines or tried to and she
00:17:45,00:17:55,got it in 1986 but it is a bad thing in that it shows what a I guess still milled world we live in.
00:17:55,00:18:01,Yeah so 1998 which is I guess the final year where it was man of the year it was given to two men
00:18:01,00:18:07,which was Bill Clinton and Ken Star and Clinton not for good reasons it was for his role in the
00:18:07,00:18:12,Clinton impeachment but the thing is is that in theory it should have gone to someone very different
00:18:12,00:18:17,that year because they held their first online poll where they asked members of the public who do
00:18:17,00:18:24,you think should be the man of the year and the winner with over 50% of the votes was a WWF
00:18:24,00:18:30,wrestler called Mick Foley who plays a character called mankind who wears Mr. Socko a sock puppet on
00:18:30,00:18:36,his hand and throws himself off high cages he got 50% of the vote but he was then pulled from the
00:18:36,00:18:40,poll and they gave it to someone else but it turns out that the poll doesn't reflect who they give it to
00:18:40,00:18:45,anyway it's a useless poll. Sure that's what they claimed after the poll when he won it we were never
00:18:45,00:18:50,going to make this decide. Yeah that's so fun. That should have been the warning about Donald Trump
00:18:50,00:18:55,shouldn't it that long ago and democracy the inevitable decline of democracy that we're seeing
00:18:55,00:19:01,today when people are voting for a WWF wrestler no offense I know you like WWF dad. Yeah Mick Foley's
00:19:01,00:19:06,amazing. I think it was when Bell and Sebastian won a Bretter world for best newcomer instead of steps
00:19:06,00:19:10,and that was done by the public I think that was when it all went wrong. Well look we've all got
00:19:10,00:19:16,our moments where the rocks settle in our opinion. We can all just agree it's bad and weirdly
00:19:16,00:19:21,that you mentioned Donald Trump because he's obviously got loads of history with Time Magazine so
00:19:21,00:19:26,he was told off by Time Magazine for making up his own Time Magazine cover and putting it on the
00:19:26,00:19:30,wall of his golf club. The magazine pointed out look at the date that you've put on this fake
00:19:30,00:19:35,magazine Kate Winslet was actually on the cover and Trump has also claimed that he's been on the
00:19:35,00:19:39,cover more times than anybody else which is not true. This is not person of the is just the cover
00:19:39,00:19:44,of the magazine but it is a US president who's been on the front more than anyone else. Do you know who?
00:19:44,00:19:50,Oh Baba. Oh Nixon. It's Nixon is rich Nixon he's been on about 55 times something crazy like that.
00:19:50,00:19:56,Yeah actually it was Nixon's successor of course who was one of the only three presidents US
00:19:56,00:20:01,presidents who haven't been time person of the old time man of the year since it started so
00:20:01,00:20:06,embarrassing and the first two were very early on so the first two were Coolidge and Hoover and we've
00:20:06,00:20:10,talked about how relevant Coolidge was before and I think one of my favorite Dorothy Parker quotes
00:20:10,00:20:15,when she was told that he died and she said something like how can they tell and so Coolidge and
00:20:15,00:20:20,Hoover were pretty crap and then the other person the other poor president who didn't get on there ever
00:20:20,00:20:25,was Gerald Ford and I hadn't realized about Gerald Ford that so famously he never won a US election
00:20:25,00:20:30,of course he just stepped in as the replacement when Nixon had to go but he stepped in because he
00:20:30,00:20:35,was VP I hadn't realized that he hadn't even won the election as VP the only reason he was vice
00:20:35,00:20:41,president was that in 1973 Spira Agnew who had been vice president had to resign on completely
00:20:41,00:20:47,different fraud and bribery related charges and so he stepped in as the default replacement as
00:20:47,00:20:52,vice president and then found himself as the default replacement as president wow and really it's
00:20:52,00:20:57,no surprise that he never quite met at the time person yeah I think the biggest slam in the time
00:20:57,00:21:03,person of the year is from 2006 when the winner was you which basically means everyone was the winner
00:21:03,00:21:09,and it was because people were you know making lots of content on the internet but then the runner
00:21:09,00:21:15,up was president after dinner jadaviran so what I think that means is he doesn't count of the you
00:21:15,00:21:24,part so everyone else in the world came first and he came second so the you the only people who
00:21:24,00:21:30,qualify to be part of the you are people who were content providers before 2006 so that means
00:21:30,00:21:35,if you had a my space account for example yes you uploaded anything then you qualify so I know that
00:21:35,00:21:42,definitely three of us must qualify Anna have you even heard of the internet in 2006 look I was
00:21:42,00:21:48,joined with up with dinner at second place and I'm comfortable with that okay um do you know
00:21:48,00:21:54,started off as a mistake the time man of the year or it started off to rectify a mistake the
00:21:54,00:21:59,magazine had made they were really embarrassed because in 1927 Charles Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic
00:21:59,00:22:05,flew across it very big deal first time and they didn't put it on the cover they just completely
00:22:05,00:22:09,flubbed it they put a picture of King George the Fifth and his wife in costume on the cover instead
00:22:09,00:22:15,that week huge editorial blunder and they thought at the end of the year hey you know what we could do
00:22:15,00:22:19,we could just say we've been saving up to call him the man of the year and that was how they started
00:22:19,00:22:24,wow and the the profile of him is hilarious in that magazine because obviously there was still
00:22:24,00:22:29,working out the form so the profile had you know word colon and that you know so they had feet
00:22:29,00:22:34,large because when he arrived at the embassy in France there were no shoes big enough for him
00:22:34,00:22:40,oh I thought you meant feet as an f-e-a-t I said what he did was the extreme we large feet
00:22:40,00:22:47,no they they listed his habits they said smokes not drinks not does not gamble
00:22:47,00:22:52,eats a thorough going breakfast avoids rich dishes they just went on like this
00:22:52,00:22:56,these don't feel like the leading elements of Charles Lindbergh's character do they
00:22:56,00:23:03,large feet not smoke they also described him as a very taciturn person all the adjectives with
00:23:03,00:23:09,things like modesty taciturnity diffidence women made in blush apparently singleness of purpose
00:23:09,00:23:16,occasional curtness and flim although we do refer to being flagnastic these days we very rarely say
00:23:16,00:23:25,that someone had he was he was part man part hackfish just the just back on computers for a second
00:23:25,00:23:30,I was reading about the Lisa so this was the computer that was given as part of the machine of
00:23:30,00:23:38,the year and Lisa had a problem so you know the Y2K problem yeah have you guys heard of the Y1995
00:23:38,00:23:47,problem no why 1995 so this was Lisa for the same reasons that all computers had the problem with Y2K
00:23:47,00:23:54,the Lisa computer only had a 15 year time limit so it was launched in 1981 for some reason they
00:23:54,00:24:01,backdated its time limit to 1980 and it only had 15 years to run before the clock freaked out and so
00:24:01,00:24:05,that was a big problem for the Lisa computer it's not like Apple to create a product that becomes
00:24:05,00:24:11,obsolete and that's true and that's why it wasn't a problem in the end that's why we haven't heard
00:24:11,00:24:19,of the Y1995 and 1982 as well the first computer virus that went through personal computers from
00:24:19,00:24:23,one to another to another there were a few viruses before that but this was the big one it was called
00:24:23,00:24:30,the elk cloner and it was invented by Rich Screnta who was a 15 year old student and it's spread by
00:24:30,00:24:35,floppy disk so he would put a game on a floppy disk give it to his friend and they would put it into
00:24:35,00:24:40,their computer and after 50 times they played the game they get a blank screen and then a poem would
00:24:40,00:24:46,come up saying it will get on all your disks it will infiltrate your chips yes it's the cloner
00:24:46,00:24:51,and then it found itself a little place to live in your computer and then the next time you put
00:24:51,00:24:56,another floppy disk on it would go on there and it's spread by floppy oh wow think about 15
00:24:56,00:24:59,year olds is they're very good with computers but often they don't have a way with work what do you
00:24:59,00:25:05,mean I haven't told you the second stands yet because it will stick to you like glue it will
00:25:05,00:25:12,modify RAM 2 send in the cloner I think we can all agree he was the W.H. Jordan of the 1980s
00:25:12,00:25:20,just one other thing that I found on computers specifically in 1982 for the first time ever a movie
00:25:20,00:25:27,Tron had used computers to do CGI but they weren't nominated for an Oscar at that year's Oscars
00:25:27,00:25:32,because the Academy saw it as cheating to have used a computer so no nomination and the best
00:25:32,00:25:37,special effects went to ET for that device calling across the moon wow pretty that's pretty good
00:25:37,00:25:40,and because they didn't use special effects they did manage to actually get someone to
00:25:40,00:25:45,bicycle across the moon and then film it didn't they yeah they fired to them out of a massive cannon
00:25:45,00:25:52,didn't they yeah that's small child what they did was that was a real moonshot that they'd taken
00:25:52,00:25:57,and they used the load of charts and stuff to work out exactly when the best shot of a moon would be
00:25:57,00:26:03,and where they had to go to America and they shot this amazing real scene and then they put green
00:26:03,00:26:08,screen to put someone like a model of a bike going in front of it wait hang on because when you say
00:26:08,00:26:12,moonshot moonshot has a different meaning doesn't it doesn't it doesn't it moonshot is oh this
00:26:12,00:26:16,is a real moonshot you know it's just one one and a million attempt to do something I seem to
00:26:16,00:26:21,meant it was a bare bottom I don't I haven't seen ET but I don't think it's a massive bare bottom that's
00:26:21,00:26:27,that the you haven't seen ET you just told us an amazing story about the most famous shot in the
00:26:27,00:26:32,entire film yeah well I I know all about it why would I watch it now I'm joke about I haven't seen
00:26:32,00:26:38,that obviously like no that is criminal I'm just still shocked sometimes when you say that
00:26:38,00:26:41,you haven't because I know you watch lots of films which are modern films yeah but I haven't
00:26:41,00:26:46,watched them yeah I haven't seen either I feel like I'm too old I haven't seen ET I have to give
00:26:46,00:26:53,you fair trade that same reaction yeah you can't see ET done I've seen at least three times on
00:26:53,00:26:58,covering us all don't worry Andy nice I hope they don't give time perst of the air for everyone who's
00:26:58,00:27:14,watched ET okay it is time for fact number three that is Anna my fact this week is that it
00:27:14,00:27:20,ought to decide which direction to go and preach every day Franciscan spun round and round until
00:27:20,00:27:24,they were so dizzy that they fell over and then went in whichever way their head was pointing
00:27:26,00:27:33,this was just this was just a group of early Franciscan preachers so in the early 1200s who got into
00:27:33,00:27:39,this and I learned this this is kind of transgressing in a way that we haven't transgressed before I'm
00:27:39,00:27:46,bringing the adverts into the podcast because I learned this on a great courses course oh my god
00:27:46,00:27:52,separate advertising believe that the rest of us do this I'm getting huge amount not to share
00:27:52,00:27:57,this fact it's not even true no look I'm sorry I'm listening to this amazing lecture series it's by
00:27:57,00:28:02,a guy called flip di leader who's it's a lecture series on the high middle ages and there was this
00:28:02,00:28:07,bit about Franciscan monks and they are fascinating so the reason that they preached in this way was
00:28:07,00:28:11,because they didn't really believe in planning for the future they thought that was all very sinful
00:28:11,00:28:16,because God should decide what you do it's up to God everything you do and planning from the
00:28:16,00:28:21,future is like you saying I know better than God and so you know they mustn't choose which direction
00:28:21,00:28:25,they walk in they'll leave it to God and it was actually portrayed in a film wasn't it which I've
00:28:25,00:28:31,never seen but I really want to call the flowers of St. Francis a Rosalini film where I think some
00:28:31,00:28:36,Franciscans do it at some point I think St. Francis does it and in that I'm not showing that movie but
00:28:36,00:28:41,the flowers of St. Francis was like pretty much a biography of St. Francis wasn't it yeah and so they
00:28:41,00:28:46,say that he did it and that's why his followers did it right yeah yeah some Francis sounds like an
00:28:46,00:28:53,interesting dude yeah apparently would sometimes strip to his pants while preaching his undergarments
00:28:53,00:28:58,I'm not sure I don't think they had M and S. Y. France back in the day but he would give his clothes
00:28:58,00:29:03,away and he played I haven't been able to find a more information about this he played a kind of
00:29:03,00:29:09,proto guitar while preaching which have been condemned by the authorities and he played his own
00:29:09,00:29:14,songs on it and he encouraged basically the red hot chili peppers isn't he getting down to his
00:29:14,00:29:20,pants and playing a guitar in front of a massive crowd yeah I never thought of him like that but yeah
00:29:20,00:29:27,I don't think he thought of himself like that yeah he was strange he converted according to one
00:29:27,00:29:32,story when a crucifix spoke to him just hanging out in a church a crucifix said hey you need to go
00:29:32,00:29:36,and rebuild this church roof so he thought well yeah the crucifix has told me I'll do it and he went
00:29:36,00:29:42,and begged for money and stones to do that and his parents were very embarrassed by his crazy
00:29:42,00:29:48,behaviour and his stripping down to his underwear and did a lot of weird stuff so when trying to
00:29:48,00:29:53,work out what rules to include in the Franciscan order for his monks he just got a Bible and again
00:29:53,00:29:57,because he loved the randomness he just said well randomly opened the Bible on three pages and the
00:29:57,00:30:03,first three things we see will have them as the rules and fortunately they were quite good things
00:30:03,00:30:09,even I think he must have done that a few times because the Bible is a very big book with a lot of
00:30:09,00:30:17,craze yeah so weird shit yeah only everyone 13 goats on a Tuesday that we have to go and attack the
00:30:17,00:30:25,K tonight a lot of his early attempts failed that's really interesting he didn't used to just
00:30:25,00:30:30,exclusively preach to humans either he would preach to animals he would preach to birds yeah that's
00:30:30,00:30:34,why he's famous for isn't it the most famous thing but really oh glad to glad to mention the
00:30:34,00:30:47,most famous thing yeah he wants persuaded a wolf to stop attacking some locals the he came to an
00:30:47,00:30:52,agreement whereby they would feed the wolf but that was due to his his great communication skills
00:30:52,00:30:58,with animals I literally all I knew about him before this research was is sort of an image of a guy
00:30:58,00:31:04,with a bird landing on his outstretched hand yeah the page of all these animals he went to the
00:31:04,00:31:11,Middle East to try and stop the crusades from happening very bullsy he visited Saladin's nephew
00:31:11,00:31:16,who was in charge of the defense against the Christian invaders and they spent a week talking and
00:31:16,00:31:21,I had a really good summit about all sorts of stuff and Saladin's nephew was very impressed with him
00:31:21,00:31:28,and then Francis went to speak to the cardinal who was in charge of the invasion effort cardinal
00:31:28,00:31:32,pelagia's galvani and said look I've had a great summit with this guy and I think maybe you should
00:31:32,00:31:38,call off this crusade and it did not work all right yeah so he went to the wrong guy he just got
00:31:38,00:31:44,pissed with an nephew an irrelevant nephew for a week and then had his attempts rejected he
00:31:44,00:31:49,um but he was a bit naive I think he sent a bunch of friends get some monks to go preaching in
00:31:49,00:31:53,Germany so this was in Italy that the order started he sent 60 of his members to go preaching in
00:31:53,00:31:57,Germany but because he weren't supposed to really plan for the future and you just had to trust
00:31:57,00:32:05,to God he said you don't need to learn German because if God wants you you will and so they turned up
00:32:05,00:32:11,and they picked up that yeah was a thing that meant yes and that was it and so it was all fine
00:32:11,00:32:15,while people were saying hey are you nice guys do you want a drink and they were like yeah yeah
00:32:15,00:32:20,and then when they said are you guys heretics you guys criminals and they kept going yeah yeah
00:32:20,00:32:23,and they all ended up sort of being arrested and then they turned to it they shut what they
00:32:23,00:32:28,should have done is got a guide book and then opening it on a random page and just said whatever
00:32:28,00:32:33,it said on the guide book I think we've got me asking my patient number right
00:32:33,00:32:39,favorite thing that I read about Francis so one of the things that we have actually mentioned
00:32:39,00:32:43,before is that he's accredited with creating the first nativity scene in case you missed that
00:32:43,00:32:48,episode ages ago he's responsible for that used live animals to do it but my favorite thing is
00:32:48,00:32:55,that he wants had to put a stop to something which was the dead body of a dead Franciscan was performing
00:32:55,00:33:00,too many miracles and it was causing traffic jams in the town basically where it was happening
00:33:00,00:33:05,because just all these miracles kept happening so people kept coming so he had to pray for the miracles
00:33:05,00:33:12,to stop because it was too chaotic and they did yeah that kind of miracles was it just like a hippopotamus
00:33:12,00:33:15,appears in the middle of the road I don't know I guess it's someone who suddenly walk again
00:33:15,00:33:19,you know that kind of stuff when you go near something that's of religious importance and so this
00:33:19,00:33:28,was a no that's jumanji you're thinking right yes this is in james jumanji was a 1995 film much like
00:33:28,00:33:37,ET I've watched jumanji it was came out last year oh my a heretic yeah this was a Franciscan
00:33:37,00:33:42,called pita katini and this was in 1220 what kind of traffic jams could you have in 1220 I
00:33:42,00:33:49,know I got human traffic I guess it was just it was not good for the area you can have a cart jam there
00:33:49,00:33:56,was actually there was a cart filled with handfish slime three cars the Franciscans themselves they
00:33:56,00:34:03,got in trouble in 2001 for hiring a Milanese fashion designer to redesign their habit oh really
00:34:03,00:34:10,they said the old one is too heavy and it was cliched that's fair isn't it I think I mean I guess
00:34:10,00:34:15,whether cliched or not shouldn't be a worry when you're a monk yeah I think the point of Franciscans
00:34:15,00:34:19,being entirely anti materialist and you know you don't really want to have any physical possession
00:34:19,00:34:25,is to deploy a Milanese fashion designer well the new one they said it was meant to be simpler
00:34:25,00:34:30,cleaner more dynamic and professional and it also had a breast pocket for a mobile phone
00:34:30,00:34:34,and the other orders were very envious of the Franciscans but there was a bit of a kerfuffle about
00:34:34,00:34:41,it here's another cliche about monks is the tonsure which is their haircut so they have like hair
00:34:41,00:34:46,just going around the side of their head don't they and then it's all bowled on top and the reason
00:34:46,00:34:52,that they have that is because they want to replicate the crown of thorns that Jesus was but there's
00:34:52,00:34:57,loads of different versions of it and the Roman Catholic one is the one that most people won't
00:34:57,00:35:02,recognize like friar tuck had and stuff that goes around like a crown of thorns but before that
00:35:02,00:35:08,in Britain they had a Celtic one and it was basically you shaved a triangle in the top of your head
00:35:08,00:35:13,so you had a massive triangular bold patch at the top of your head and you had no hair everywhere else
00:35:13,00:35:17,and I just think that that sounds like that's the next thing in Milanese fashion houses isn't it
00:35:17,00:35:24,a triangular bold patch I had no idea that that was a crown of thorns I thought it was to do with
00:35:24,00:35:31,I thought it was just genetic male pattern boldness affects monks the same way it affects all of us
00:35:31,00:35:35,yeah I mean it might be you know like when your sights go bold and then you start shaving your
00:35:35,00:35:40,head it's like no no it's a crown of thorns honestly and another person with a haircut like that
00:35:40,00:35:47,willy thorn interesting willy here's the the snooker player it's it's a very niche reference for
00:35:47,00:35:53,a demographic of listers to those who think is a fish I'm not sure how many of them know who willy
00:35:53,00:36:02,thorn is but there are a couple of middle age men got foeing in there I found a few other bizarre
00:36:02,00:36:08,people from that time so St Joseph of Cupertino he's an interesting character much like I was saying
00:36:08,00:36:14,with the other guy Peter causing traffic with his constant miracles Cupertino had a problem where
00:36:14,00:36:19,he was constantly flying so he was known as the flying saint and people if they'd mentioned Jesus
00:36:19,00:36:24,he would just start levitating up and this was a constant thing that would happen and it became a
00:36:24,00:36:29,problem in his life it was I'm not surprised yeah he is a preacher people are going to be mentioning
00:36:29,00:36:32,Jesus all the time to him even if someone just hears their thumb with the hammer and says Jesus
00:36:32,00:36:37,does he start floating yeah it got even worse for him it went if you started mentioning saints
00:36:37,00:36:42,any saint he would start flying so it became very disruptive to the point where people didn't like it
00:36:42,00:36:47,and they ostracized him they got rid of him and said you can't be part of this how did they do
00:36:47,00:36:52,they they just keep going Jesus safe Jesus safe Jesus safe until he floated away so far they
00:36:52,00:36:56,couldn't see him anymore yeah no he ended up in a monastery and they kept him in a cell by himself
00:36:56,00:37:01,so he he must have done some other things wrong other than just floated but he's uh yeah so that
00:37:01,00:37:05,was a problem um all four been kept in a cell as well he must have hit his head on the ceiling
00:37:05,00:37:11,constantly and obviously once he hits it goes Jesus three hits it it's a horrible loop
00:37:11,00:37:16,I like the fact that another one of the leading preachers at the time who actually ended up being
00:37:16,00:37:20,labeled a heretic even though he was basically the same as Francis of Assisi was Waldo
00:37:20,00:37:27,so wow the Waldenzians uh there was a big search for him wasn't there afterwards
00:37:27,00:37:31,it was yeah he was always in crowds though right because he tried to huge crowds so
00:37:31,00:37:36,right another guy St. Dennis have you heard of St. Dennis he had his head chopped off but continued
00:37:36,00:37:42,to walk and preach afterwards and he was made the patron saint of headaches if you had your head
00:37:42,00:37:46,cut off yeah would you have phantom head syndrome no I think you'd have phantom body
00:37:46,00:37:51,syndrome wouldn't you yeah because you're magnus in the head part I don't think he lasted too long
00:37:51,00:37:57,I think he picked up his head and walked for six kilometers and buried it and then fell down so
00:37:57,00:38:02,I think he did last quite a long time if that's what he did I think that's much more impressive
00:38:02,00:38:07,than I could handle that's true uh twirling monks are still a thing to a certain extent
00:38:07,00:38:13,oh yeah yeah so uh in 2019 last year there was a Buddhist monk uh she was called Master Hu Yen
00:38:13,00:38:18,she was in Taiwan and she was blessing a temple and you can see footage of her doing us a line
00:38:18,00:38:25,and she blesses the temple by going along the red carpet up towards it twirling 150 times in a row
00:38:25,00:38:32,wow unfortunately she then throws up and it's a less spiritual ending to the video than you would
00:38:32,00:38:36,expect that would be a easier way of doing this some Francis thing wouldn't it it's like whatever
00:38:36,00:38:42,direction the vomit goes follow it follow follow the fire your gender so there is a modern day
00:38:42,00:38:49,follower of the Franciscan faith and this is in Brazil it's a lady she's a grandmother in Brazil
00:38:49,00:38:56,and she as part of her faith would pray to Saint Anthony of Padua apart from her grandchildren
00:38:56,00:39:01,realized that she wasn't praying to a figurine of Saint Anthony of Padua at all she was praying to
00:39:01,00:39:08,a figure of Elrond Lord of River Del Lord of the Rings and she'd been praying to this elf every
00:39:08,00:39:14,single day for a couple of years and it turned out it was just an elf she had lovely pointy years
00:39:14,00:39:20,at the end of it we need to move on in a sec guys I was just looking into other leading religious figures
00:39:20,00:39:25,in this period and someone who's particularly amazing is Hildegard of Bingan so I didn't know much about
00:39:25,00:39:31,her vaguely heard of her but she was this very very influential Christian mystic and she sort of
00:39:31,00:39:35,traveled around a lot very unusual for a woman to independently travel around and used to draw
00:39:35,00:39:42,these huge crowds she was a rock star and she was a composer she's actually the only person really
00:39:42,00:39:48,whose music we still play from the Middle Ages so it's still played in song today and she was a
00:39:48,00:39:52,philosopher she's like the founder of German natural history she was amazing and she was very religious
00:39:52,00:39:58,none but she also invented her own language and I think it's the first person we have evidence of
00:39:58,00:40:03,doing kind of what we did with Esperanto which is trying to invent a perfect language a new alphabet
00:40:03,00:40:09,and we've got this whole glossary of her language that she wrote in it's over a thousand words
00:40:09,00:40:13,and she just made up this language it's full of seds and it's really weird stuff like she's got a
00:40:13,00:40:19,specific word for great great great great great grandfather and she's got you know drunkards
00:40:19,00:40:26,vaginas urine she's made up her whole name she covered all the main the main subjects my drunk
00:40:26,00:40:31,great great great great grandfather's got a vagina she could say that yeah and it's full of urine
00:40:31,00:40:42,okay it is time for our final fact of the show and that is Andy my fact is that in 2004 a Canadian
00:40:42,00:40:46,cheese maker dropped fifty thousand dollars worth of cheese into a lake to make it taste better
00:40:46,00:40:55,but then lost the cheese oh no I know okay so that could possibly be like the most tasty bit of
00:40:55,00:41:00,cheese that's ever been made and we'll never find it I know after 15 years in the lake is
00:41:00,00:41:08,probably approaching its peak so this was a Canadian cheese maker he ran a from a jury called
00:41:08,00:41:15,La from a jury Boava he dropped 800 kilos of cheese into the water of this lake in 2004
00:41:15,00:41:21,and he let it sit there for a year and he was really confident that it would be delicious once it
00:41:21,00:41:26,had a bit of lake treatment but they started looking for it it wasn't in the spot they left it in
00:41:26,00:41:30,and then they ramped up the search a bit so they started sending in divers and
00:41:30,00:41:35,then they sent in some tracking equipment after three dives they still hadn't found the cheese
00:41:35,00:41:40,and the cheese maker was called Luke Boava he said it got too expensive at some point you can't be
00:41:40,00:41:45,crazy and they just called off the search so this is a phantom cheese that the world will never get
00:41:45,00:41:50,to it so the reason that they thought to put all this cheese in the water is actually because
00:41:50,00:41:56,a fisherman had come to them a few years earlier and said that he'd found a bit of their cheese
00:41:56,00:42:01,at the bottom of a lake now I don't know how that bit of cheese got there but he's found it
00:42:01,00:42:04,and the first thing he thought when he got this cheese out of the lake is I'll just try it and see
00:42:04,00:42:10,what it's like and he said it was the most tasty cheese that he'd ever had and so obviously this
00:42:10,00:42:14,framachery guy thought well I'll just put all the rest of my cheese in the water
00:42:14,00:42:21,this is the complex science on which framagia's depend is just the random word of a crazy
00:42:21,00:42:26,fisherman who eats cheese off the bottom of the lake basically he just right the hag fish off
00:42:26,00:42:32,and also they should have seen it coming right because wasn't the lake called a bada ha ha
00:42:32,00:42:36,yes it's one of the few places in the world which has punctuation in the name of the place because
00:42:36,00:42:42,ha ha has exclamation marks after it yeah yeah even if they had found the cheese there is
00:42:42,00:42:46,serious doubt of whether they would have been able to sell it because the Canadian food inspection
00:42:46,00:42:51,agency are real sticklers about just put dropping food in a lake and then selling it to the
00:42:51,00:42:56,public and they said yeah we would have needed to check this throughout its age and process
00:42:56,00:43:00,yeah and then they interviewed afterwards one of the divers who was looking for the cheese
00:43:00,00:43:05,a guy called Mr. Daffour and they said are you know are you not a bit sad that you didn't find the
00:43:05,00:43:11,cheese he's like no I'm really optimistic because the Titanic sank in 1912 and it was only found
00:43:11,00:43:18,in 1985 so as far as he's concerned there's still plenty of time to find this cheese
00:43:18,00:43:23,I like the idea that the Oscar winning film in the year 2060 is going to be a film called Bravan's
00:43:23,00:43:28,Cheese where they finally read the giant cheese from the bottom of the way I would have thought
00:43:28,00:43:33,that would be better than Titanic because I haven't seen Titanic but surprise surprise you know
00:43:33,00:43:38,what's going to happen at the end don't you whereas in this cheese it's an actual mystery of what
00:43:38,00:43:45,happens at the end and I read also an article this was in was in 2005 Andy and so obviously in 2005
00:43:45,00:43:51,it was quite a slow news yeah and so it was in the news a fair amount and then afterwards they said
00:43:51,00:43:57,that he was going to do it again and he was going to fit the cheddar with a tracking device
00:43:57,00:44:01,so but then I couldn't find if he's actually done it and there's nothing on his website to say that
00:44:01,00:44:06,he's done it so I don't know maybe he looked back to that quote that Andy gave us where he said
00:44:06,00:44:10,at a certain point of crazy you've got to realize you've got to stop and turn around and he
00:44:10,00:44:17,reflected a little bit on that he's the one million dollar multi beam sonar device to find this cheese
00:44:17,00:44:24,what because amazing it's absolutely amazing it's basically the Canadian Nessie is this cheese yeah
00:44:24,00:44:31,there is lots of when you're probing cheese or when you're trying to do experiments on cheese so
00:44:31,00:44:37,there has been a new method developed in the last year in Uruguay Uruguay and scientists
00:44:37,00:44:42,developed a method to non-destructively probe emintel cheese which is massive news for the industry
00:44:42,00:44:47,does emintel have holes in it it does so surely it's easy to probe without destroying it you just go
00:44:47,00:44:51,through one of the holes no there aren't holes on the outside because obviously it's right and I think
00:44:51,00:44:57,you knew that and you were teasing me basically you need to measure when the eyes as they call the holes
00:44:57,00:45:02,are big enough and when they're at the right size the cheese is ripe and if it's too long then the
00:45:02,00:45:07,eyes all merge into each other the cheese collapses disaster so you make a batch of cheese and to measure
00:45:07,00:45:14,it normally you would need to sacrifice a wheel of cheese every time that's a lesser known bit of
00:45:14,00:45:20,the Bible isn't it where they sacrifice a wheel of cheese Abraham it's a god I won't give you my son
00:45:20,00:45:27,but I will give you this baby bell so anyway so normally you need to as I say sacrifice one of your
00:45:27,00:45:32,precious cheeses every time you want to measure the bubble size but these Uruguay and scientists have
00:45:32,00:45:38,invented a kind of magic cheese hammer it's kind of a sonic electrical probe which allows you to
00:45:38,00:45:45,tell from the sound it's like a tuning fork if you like for cheese but they're very specialist
00:45:45,00:45:49,instruments obviously and you need a lot of training to tell from the sound whether a cheese is ripe
00:45:49,00:45:55,but the new method is an electrical hammer which allows any old schmo who doesn't have years of
00:45:55,00:46:01,training and expertise to tell the writers of the cheese without destroying it so this is big news
00:46:01,00:46:08,I was in a cheese shop the other day no the other month in France when real hard to go outside
00:46:08,00:46:13,and they had like the back room you could look into the back room and they had all the massive
00:46:13,00:46:19,wheels of cheese you know like they're really really expensive aren't they and they use them as like
00:46:19,00:46:24,lone collateral and stuff like that and it was just really amazing to see how big these massive
00:46:24,00:46:29,wheels of cheese are because they're absolutely huge how big we're talking give us an animal
00:46:29,00:46:37,I would say 350 weasels wow thank you that's huge that's done nothing for me
00:46:37,00:46:43,is that an elephant what is that could we not pick one animal is that it's kind of a big really big
00:46:43,00:46:50,big yeah or a small pony like a shetland pony but if you squashed it down into a circle yeah
00:46:50,00:46:56,you cut your legs off you're bending the legs into the body and then making it into a circle either way
00:46:56,00:47:01,I think the authorities will be taking a close interest I'm actually the most interesting Canadian
00:47:01,00:47:07,cheese I could find was a giant cheese the mammoth cheese this was prepared for the Chicago
00:47:07,00:47:12,world's fur of 1893 but it came from Canada from Ontario which is one of its biggest cheese
00:47:12,00:47:20,producing provinces and it weighed 9900 kilos which I was trying to see what that was the equivalent
00:47:20,00:47:26,of and it's the equivalent of 144 average sized women how many is that in weasels
00:47:26,00:47:34,you're gonna have to do the weasels to women conversion yourself that it's amazing it was an
00:47:34,00:47:39,amazing undertaking they used milk from dairies all over the country all over Canada and they had
00:47:39,00:47:43,a special railway car made because the first one they put it on it just fell through the bottle
00:47:43,00:47:50,wow so they had to transport it by this railway from Ontario to Chicago and they had a cheese
00:47:50,00:47:54,timetable which they sent ahead to all the stations so everyone in the stations between the two
00:47:54,00:47:59,places flocked to their station when they checked the timetable for when the cheese was pulling in
00:47:59,00:48:04,so that they could come and see it and by the time it got to Chicago it had so many thousands of
00:48:04,00:48:09,signatures on it from the people who come to see it on the cheese on the blin and cheese they had to
00:48:09,00:48:14,it was on the grind yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but that's still pretty so gross while the cheese
00:48:14,00:48:20,was going on the train people were running alongside it signing it or it sounds like it must have
00:48:20,00:48:24,stopped at the stations but I don't think anyone was boarding and it wouldn't have been a sold train
00:48:24,00:48:28,just for the cheese you'd have a carriage for it wouldn't you would do no they probably just had
00:48:28,00:48:32,a carriage you wouldn't send a whole train and just have all the other carriages empty and just
00:48:32,00:48:37,one cheese in one carriage but also equally you wouldn't be like sat in carajay or be of a train
00:48:37,00:48:43,and they have to climb around the massive cheese to get to the buffet cart that's true that is the
00:48:43,00:48:51,buffet cart is it yeah what year was it Sanna? 1893 1893 okay because I found another mammoth cheese
00:48:51,00:48:57,from 1866 which has also shipped around to Toronto in New York and I only know about it because of
00:48:57,00:49:01,a famous poem that was running about it do you guys know the cheese poet of Canada? No
00:49:02,00:49:08,this is a guy called James McIntyre acknowledged to be one of the worst poets ever he's born in the
00:49:08,00:49:13,early 1800s and he was a poet but no one knew this until after he died he only got fame because he
00:49:13,00:49:20,was included in collections with titles like very bad poetry which got him famous and his most famous
00:49:20,00:49:26,poem is called ode to the mammoth cheese weighing over seven thousand pounds and as it is at James
00:49:26,00:49:32,read some poetry I'll give you a quick extract we have seen the queen of cheese lying quietly at your
00:49:32,00:49:40,ease gently fined by evening breeze thy fair form no flies dare seize all galley dressed soon you'll go
00:49:40,00:49:46,to the provincial show to be admired by many a bow in the city of torrentu
00:49:46,00:49:53,so to the mammoth cheese weighing over seven thousand pounds that is brilliant yeah that's another
00:49:53,00:50:00,one that should have started to compete another Canadian cheese craft you know craft cheese
00:50:00,00:50:06,so just like this there Canadian and the guy who invented craft cheese was Canadian he invented
00:50:06,00:50:11,pasteurized cheese which everyone wanted to call embalmed cheese when he first invented it
00:50:11,00:50:17,because all the cheese makers thought you can't have this kind of industrial process making cheese
00:50:17,00:50:21,it should only be our special cheeses that we make that you can sell and so you're going to have
00:50:21,00:50:25,to call it embalmed cheese and then in the end they had to call it processed cheese of course
00:50:25,00:50:30,but he fought against that and he had a business partner he was going to go out of business
00:50:30,00:50:35,but he decided to have a business partner and he made Jesus Christ his business partner this is
00:50:35,00:50:40,on the craft website if you go on there oh I didn't think Jesus had a very good head for business
00:50:40,00:50:47,did you not say Jesus Christ I didn't say Jesus Christ but that's what he remarked himself as
00:50:49,00:50:54,no it's on the website it says that basically he was doing really badly and then he decided to make
00:50:54,00:51:00,Jesus Christ his business partner he gave 25% of his personal profits to the church and suddenly
00:51:00,00:51:04,everything picked up and he became really really popular and then a few years later he brought in
00:51:04,00:51:09,his brother's Charles Herbert Frederick Norman and John into the business wow what a slam for the
00:51:09,00:51:18,brother who's been invited after Jesus Christ we have God to thank for craft I was actually reading
00:51:18,00:51:23,a there was a book written by a random guy who visited the craft family a few years ago and the
00:51:23,00:51:28,family tradition says it's been passed down that the reason he got the inspiration to pair up with
00:51:28,00:51:33,God slash Jesus as his business partner was when he was just he was selling cheese in Canada like
00:51:33,00:51:37,one trotting around the streets in his cheese cart and the donkey that was pulling the wagon from
00:51:37,00:51:43,which he was selling turned around to him and told him they had to make things right with God
00:51:43,00:51:47,and get him involved in the company and it was only after the donkey spoke to him that
00:51:48,00:51:54,he went into this very lucrative business partnership talking donkey it's basically Shrek
00:51:54,00:52:00,I mean I haven't seen Shrek but I think there is a topic donkey in it isn't there so annoying
00:52:00,00:52:07,that you're basically with all the film references that is amazing we're going to have to wrap up
00:52:07,00:52:11,in a second anyone got anything else they want to add before we do I like the the cyclops in the
00:52:11,00:52:20,Odyssey basically ran a cheese factory just looking at old cheeses so he um if you look at the
00:52:20,00:52:25,Odyssey from a different angle then Odysseus is really the villain here so he goes with all his
00:52:25,00:52:31,men to the cyclops as big caves and so you probably know that the cyclops had a big sheep farm
00:52:31,00:52:34,because the way they all escaped at the end is by clinging to the underside of this sheep as they
00:52:34,00:52:39,counted out of the caves but basically all these men snuck into the cyclops as caves and they
00:52:39,00:52:44,found that the cyclops has been milking all of his sheep and then keeping storing the milk in his caves
00:52:44,00:52:51,kind of like rock forest is stored in order to mature into cheese and so they sort of stole the cheese
00:52:51,00:52:56,from the caves and escaped but I just love the fact that the cyclops was just a cheese farmer
00:52:56,00:53:02,that story honestly the cyclops is the good guy and that story isn't he because they yeah they
00:53:02,00:53:08,blind him he's only got one item to begin with and they blind him and then they steal all of his
00:53:08,00:53:14,stuff I always hated that story you know they blind him so they hide underneath the sheep so they
00:53:14,00:53:18,can't feel him because he feels the top of the sheep doesn't he I don't know I think that's sneaky
00:53:18,00:53:23,and not very nice he is going to eat them isn't he are you specifically says when I come back
00:53:23,00:53:27,I'm going to kill you and he's just nature but that's because they've eaten all of his cheese he's
00:53:27,00:53:32,got nothing left to put in his images I think the theory is that it's um it's feta or that it's a
00:53:32,00:53:38,kind of proto-feta if it's a cheese feta I think so yeah I weirdly don't know the story we've talked about
00:53:38,00:53:43,it on this podcast I love that you do though James I love that there's a period where you stop
00:53:43,00:53:48,taking stuff in but then you're far back and up and you pick it up again yeah
00:53:48,00:53:53,it's very exciting we've just told you the story in such a weird order now I wonder what your head
00:53:53,00:53:59,is like trying to piece together this is like moving the mental that I haven't seen where everything's
