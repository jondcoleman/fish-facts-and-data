00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,080
 "Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming

2
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,960
 to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

3
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:28,440
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, Anatozhinsky

4
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:33,000
 and James Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,640
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.

6
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,880
 Starting with James."

7
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:45,760
 My fact this week is that hagfish can eat by sitting inside the dinner and absorbing

8
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,800
 the nutrients through the skin.

9
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,840
 It isn't that amazing.

10
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,760
 Wouldn't that be incredible if you could just sit inside your curry and just eat the food

11
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,760
 like that?

12
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,040
 Maybe some foods it would be worse for or messier for.

13
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,040
 Go on.

14
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:04,520
 The way if you have to get inside a sausage before eating it, do you think you're very big

15
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,520
 outside?

16
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,720
 I think it's going to be messy almost whatever food you're climbing inside.

17
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,720
 You're true.

18
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,480
 I think with a sausage you might just rub it against your skin rather than climbing

19
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,480
 and strapping it.

20
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,480
 Strap the sausage to yourself.

21
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,960
 I think so and then it'll only absorb it.

22
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,120
 That's what I would do if I was a hagfish.

23
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,120
 That's a good idea.

24
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,040
 I'd like to see a hagfish eating a sausage because they look a bit like a long sausage.

25
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,200
 You wouldn't know what was going to be what.

26
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,800
 I should probably explain what a hagfish is, shouldn't I?

27
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:36,920
 It kind of looks like an eel and it is most famous among people on the internet for creating

28
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,280
 loads and loads of slime.

29
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,280
 That's what they do.

30
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,600
 Basically when they're threatened they create this incredible amount of slime and it stops

31
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,520
 them from being able to be eaten.

32
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,200
 But the way that they eat they have a few different ways of eating.

33
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,000
 They can rasp things with their tongue, they've got extremely hard tongues that can rub against

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,040
 some meat and bring it into the digestive system or they can actually just absorb it through

35
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,040
 their skin.

36
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:04,480
 Actually weirdly enough the skin one is a slightly better way of them getting nutrients.

37
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,480
 It is.

38
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,480
 It is bizarre.

39
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:10,240
 It is better for them to absorb food or they can do it faster or more effectively.

40
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,240
 They can do it so much.

41
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,240
 They can do it more efficiently.

42
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,240
 You know what I thought?

43
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,240
 I was thinking about this.

44
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,200
 Why don't we all just absorb food through our skin?

45
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,080
 Why do we have it through our stomach?

46
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,080
 I don't know if this is right but I did wonder if maybe if you eat a sandwich and it goes

47
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:28,000
 inside your stomach then no one else can get at it once it's in your stomach, you're

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 new to eating it.

49
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,560
 But if you sell it to your face then someone might be able to come and steal it off you

50
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,640
 so maybe that's one reason why it's better to eat stuff.

51
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,640
 That's what I was thinking.

52
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,820
 If you were sort of sat next to them you could just stick your finger in it and like a straw

53
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,820
 just suck at it.

54
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,820
 I don't think that's the reason.

55
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,820
 Can I just suck at it?

56
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,420
 I don't think that's the reason the stomach evolved.

57
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,420
 Is it not?

58
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:51,840
 I don't think it is a size thing and that size thing.

59
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,180
 So for example some very small organisms can absorb oxygen directly through their skin

60
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:02,340
 even some tiny frogs but larger animals have such a large volume in relation to the skin

61
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,700
 area they have that it's inefficient for them to do that.

62
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:08,860
 It wouldn't be possible to absorb all the, so I think humans might need so many calories

63
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:13,660
 a day that you couldn't absorb you know 20 sausages a day through your skin.

64
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:18,620
 I know I'm going to email Ed Young and ask him because I read this fact in an article in

65
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:24,260
 the Atlantic written by Ed Young and by the way if you have like a few hours or a day or

66
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:28,500
 a week to spare go on the internet and search for Ed Young and read everything that he's

67
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,360
 ever written because he's a brilliant science writer.

68
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,180
 Oh it's heaven to read his articles yeah so true such a good shout go and read that.

69
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:41,540
 What do they eat by the way is it dead sharks or is it seeds right in this case yeah in

70
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:45,060
 this they can eat lots of different things but in this case where they're sitting inside

71
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:49,980
 something has to be something a lot bigger than them and so it'll be like Anna says probably

72
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,460
 whale carcasses or something like that.

73
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:55,860
 So they don't have a lower jaw that's the other thing about them they've only got upper

74
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:01,380
 teeth because they're quite badly put together animals and the only way they can bite something

75
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:05,860
 is they can tie themselves in knots really easily and they tie a knot at their tail and

76
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:10,860
 then they work the knot all the way along their body until it gets to where the lower

77
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:15,900
 jaw would be and that provides a lower surface for them to squeeze their upper jaw against.

78
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:21,640
 I mean they're really so awkward for saying they also use the knots actually for scraping

79
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:26,340
 themselves free of slime don't they when they eject all the slime they knot themselves

80
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:30,460
 up and they've got a knot at their head and they'll pull the knot down to the tail to lose

81
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,460
 the slime.

82
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,780
 It's multi-purpose knots.

83
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:37,340
 The slime is a real headline I mean the the absorbing stuff is good but the amount of

84
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,060
 slime that they make is incredible.

85
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,920
 It's amazing and the slime that they produce the way that it expands at the rated expands

86
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,320
 is just insane.

87
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:50,840
 So Jung puts in the article that it can expand by 10,000 times in the fraction of a second

88
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:56,440
 and there's been cases of that very famous photo actually online of a truck of hagfish

89
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:02,980
 overturning and covering an entire car and slime the entire road just slime everywhere

90
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,220
 in a second.

91
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,700
 We should say that it's not although the main purpose of this slime is so that they can go

92
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:15,900
 viral on the internet it has a self purpose of being a very useful protective device so basically

93
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:21,100
 it's not a single predator with gills is able to consume them because they would be quite

94
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,340
 easily consumable otherwise because they eject this slime and immediately it clogs up

95
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:29,460
 all of a predator's gills so if you're a shark or something your gills are suddenly clogged

96
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:33,220
 up you can't breathe anymore and we don't know there's a lot we don't know about hagfish

97
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:38,180
 but we don't know if this actually kills them because we've seen videos of them get clogged

98
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:42,460
 up and they swim away and then we don't really know how they'll get the slime off.

99
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,220
 So they're safe from any predators with gills.

100
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:51,780
 It's mostly water the slime isn't it is 99.996% water and each time they release a bucket

101
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:58,140
 s worth of slime or a jug of slime it's only 40 milligrams of actual stuff that they

102
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:03,060
 are giving off from their body mucus and proteins is almost none but it reacts so quickly

103
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:07,180
 with the water that it generates this massive amount otherwise it would be the slime they

104
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,020
 would have to have this massive slime tank inside them.

105
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:14,500
 The amount they have inside them is extraordinary in terms of the fibers that then turn into

106
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:19,660
 the slime so it's sort of two toned slime production equipment they've got these lengths

107
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:24,020
 of fibers in their body and then they've got some mucus and the length of fiber in their

108
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:28,780
 body the total length is 20,000 kilometers of fiber.

109
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:34,340
 So and it comes in these 15 centimeters long threads so lots of these little threads coiled

110
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:38,820
 up in these tiny little storage boxes inside their body so the thread that means that the

111
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:44,060
 threads are essentially 10 million times longer than they are wide I think and just coiled

112
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,060
 up.

113
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,900
 I read one explanation of this you might have read the same thing Anna which is it's the

114
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:54,620
 same as stuffing one kilometer of Christmas lights into a shoe box with that single

115
00:06:54,620 --> 00:07:00,700
 knot or tangle that's because the slime glands are so small and these threads are so numerous.

116
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:05,020
 Well they're big generally the skin on them so there was a study that was done that was

117
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:10,140
 showing that in a lot of cases the slime that they released to predators let's say to clog

118
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:14,860
 their gills is actually released after their bitten and they try to work out how they

119
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:19,500
 survive after their bitten and it turns out that the metaphor they use is basically their

120
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:25,740
 skin is like really loose pyjamas like they're just so flabby with extra skin that if you

121
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:30,500
 injected them with the same volume of stuff that's in them you could get 40% more of them

122
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,820
 into them before their skin starts to stretch that's how loose they are.

123
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:38,580
 Yeah they're like exhausted with a very massive skin and it's only attached in a few places

124
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:43,660
 as well as again so that they can avoid being bitten if they get bitten the shark is mostly

125
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:48,660
 biting skin really yeah and they've also they're the bloodiest animals on the planet

126
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:55,540
 or close to it so there's 17 milliliters of blood per 100 grams of mass which is a lot.

127
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:01,380
 At least twice as much as any other fish I think and also apparently they maybe have the blood

128
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:05,220
 because they need something to fill the space between their flesh and their skin they just

129
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:08,500
 got to put some liquid in there so they're like well I guess I'll make more blood to fill

130
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:14,180
 myself up that's so weird it seems so inefficient as a fish to have a loose set of pyjamas

131
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:23,620
 on. What's going on with the name I wonder? Hagfish because they're not which is snow no I just

132
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:28,500
 wonder if there's any link between that and Hagrid which is a you know that's a word for

133
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:33,460
 bedeviled by witches isn't it or that was the origin of the name Hagrid yeah I think it's just it

134
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:39,780
 goes back to the 1603 or something it's really what quite a long time and it is just because they

135
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:44,660
 thought they were ugly although it would have been a worse series of books if a giant Hagfish

136
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:52,100
 had turned up and slimed Harry Potter. How are you choking? A Hagfish in Harry Potter would

137
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:57,700
 absolutely turn the figure lights wouldn't it? It would be brilliant. It does seem like a missed

138
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:03,620
 opportunity for a great superhero the Hagfish just I can't believe I mean it's amazing that this

139
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:08,580
 is the one fish that nothing can eat. Well no no anything with our gills can eat it. Yeah of course

140
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:13,700
 it's going to eat it happily. South Koreans can eat it. Obviously that gills that's one of the

141
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:18,100
 first things everyone knows about people in South Korea. Yeah they huge popular there they eat about

142
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:23,860
 was it five million pounds of Hagfish meat every year. Wow and you get Hagfish wallets? You do don't

143
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:28,340
 you. Those have a very useful adaptation because obviously if someone tries to mug you it immediately

144
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:35,140
 sweats. This is a gloop and the mugger it's unable to actually grip your wallet. It's called

145
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:40,180
 Is eel leather isn't it I think. So if you've got anything this eel skin leather is actually

146
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:45,540
 hagglish and apparently I read somewhere that it's sort of as a more ethical alternative to

147
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:51,540
 actual leather. I think on the ethical hierarchy maybe it's sort of as more ethical to get some Hagfish

148
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:57,380
 than some cow or whatever but say go if you think that's more ethical you should have the Hagfish what?

149
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:02,020
 It sounds like you don't think it's more ethical. I covered my mind Andy I don't have an opinion

150
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:07,140
 we just present the facts and we let other people draw their conclusions. Does anyone know

151
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:13,780
 how Hagfish have sex? Do they tie themselves in knots? Actually Anna's right nobody knows.

152
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:20,260
 That was the question. Does anyone know how long Hagfish live? It's seven years.

153
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:28,500
 No again nobody knows how long Hagfish live. Does anyone know why 90% of them appear to be female?

154
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:35,700
 Another no. It's not interesting like of all the Hagfish that we caught 90% of them are female

155
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:40,420
 and we don't really know why. It might be that 90% of them are female or it might be that the

156
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:45,460
 females are easier to catch we don't really know. All that they're all homophrodites but when they

157
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:50,340
 sense they're about to be caught they throw away their penises. That's equally well. I mean it's

158
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:58,340
 all equally likely. So supposedly it's really hard to find their eggs and I think this is a bit like

159
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:03,860
 do you remember we talked about eels and how hard it is to find their gonads but it's supposedly in

160
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:09,780
 the 20th century scientists found a total of three Hagfish embryos and that was it because they live

161
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:17,620
 really deep down. Before that there was one man called Bashvardin and in 1896 he found 800 eggs

162
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:25,060
 including 150 embryos and he is the kind of hero of Hagfish research but he had two main interests

163
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:31,700
 in life. One of them was Hagfish and Zoology and the other was armour, military armour and when he

164
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:37,220
 wasn't collecting Hagfish embryos he was obsessed with collecting medieval armour. He started bidding

165
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:44,100
 in auctions age 9 for medieval stuff and anyway he became a... He was getting too much pocket money

166
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,500
 if that's the age you're bidding in. He did get outbid. He got outbid in his first few but he

167
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:54,180
 he was he became a museum curator and was it immensely well regarded in his field and then the first

168
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:58,980
 World War happened and absolutely all the work he'd done over his life paid off because he started

169
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:06,180
 designing helmets based on medieval military armour because the US Army needed a metal helmet basically

170
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:11,860
 that would stop bullets and he designed several prototypes. One of them was designed exactly on a 15th

171
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:17,540
 century Italian knights helmet so it looks like a proper full face visor with a tiny slit for the

172
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:22,900
 eyes and that was being built in the 20th century because of Bashvardin. So we used medieval helmet

173
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:27,940
 designs for the First World War because I thought we'd moved on from then. Well it was for people that

174
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:31,620
 that particular one was for people who were in a forward position say they were in an extremely

175
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:36,020
 dangerous environment and they needed lots of protection for a short space of time because it was so

176
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:41,700
 heavy this helmet that it made the helmet weighed six kilos alone. Sorry can I just ask when you say

177
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:46,740
 he found these 10 million embryos or whatever and we've only ever found three where are we finding them?

178
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:54,260
 What's it not at Southern Beasts when he was ten years old? He's surprised the story is that he

179
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:58,740
 collected them from fishermen who had been dangling lines with bait on them and I don't know why

180
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:04,820
 that couldn't then be just done again but we think maybe they hide their eggs on the floor of the ocean

181
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:10,180
 or that yeah so there are lots of theories. Do you guys know the US Navy's been experimenting with

182
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:16,740
 hagfish in warfare? Hmm what's it well for the slime thing off are they getting nutrients? For the slime

183
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:23,540
 thing. So using the soldiers to climb inside a whale corpse? No not that yeah I'm sure that's on

184
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:29,780
 the card so they have been trying to use the slime as a non-lethal way of stopping these boats and

185
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:34,820
 destroying them by chucking it at the propellers of the boats so if you can slime up the propellers

186
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:38,980
 you would stop their rotors from turning and you would disable the ship entirely. I know they're

187
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:43,460
 going to extract the slime from hagfish separately or do you just get a big tub of hagfish and then

188
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:48,020
 shock it at the end of it when they can't do it. Yeah you feel like that could be just that right like

189
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:52,340
 it's they produce so much but no I think they're synthesizing it I think they're turning it into

190
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:56,980
 something different. Yeah what they do is they put the jeans that create hagfish slime into

191
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:02,340
 E. coli bacteria and then the bacteria can create the slime themselves so you can do it on a

192
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:07,620
 larger sort of manufacturing scale. Seriously yeah nice that feels. And without scraping thousands of

193
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:12,180
 hagfish off the floor of the ocean I suppose. It's more ethical I would say. It's pretty more

194
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:17,140
 ethical yeah the bacteria don't think so James. No you're right who will speak for the bacteria if

195
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:26,820
 not Alan Tishinsky the bacteria spread. Okay it is time for fact number two and that is my fact

196
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:33,140
 my fact this week is that 1982's time person of the year was the personal computer. The article

197
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:40,020
 announcing it was written on a typewriter very bizarre. Yeah so this is obviously time have the

198
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:44,020
 tradition of doing person of the year and this was the first year in which they did machine of the

199
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:48,580
 year they stepped away from person of the year and they gave it to the computer but the time

200
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:54,260
 offices in 1982 were still running almost entirely on typewriter as they wouldn't upgrade their

201
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:59,780
 systems for another year so they were behind the times with their own person of the year.

202
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:06,260
 Was it do we think it was a hint to the owners you know making it first of the year? Guys we still

203
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:11,700
 don't have one of these fuckers okay. The article was quite interesting because it referenced Apple's

204
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:17,060
 first personal computer which was called Lisa but Steve Jobs was really annoyed about it and that's

205
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:22,020
 because he expected to be named person of the year that year and so he was really annoyed that

206
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:27,700
 the computer got his title and he was also annoyed because it said that he had a data named Lisa

207
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:32,740
 but he denied paternity of that data so he was just ultra pissed off with that. He was really bad

208
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:38,420
 in that article. Steve Jobs the way he denied the paternity he said that 28% of the male population

209
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:42,500
 of the United States could be the father of this child deemed unlikely though but they have to

210
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:49,540
 say unlikely yeah. Why did he say that? He took a paternity test which showed that there was 94%

211
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:53,860
 chance that it was his game time. Oh I see because the way that you said it sounded like he was

212
00:15:53,860 --> 00:16:00,020
 been unbelievably misogynistic about his ex part. That's true. Slept with all like pretty much

213
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:05,060
 every sexually active man in the entire country. That's so true I should have yeah I should have

214
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:09,060
 qualified. That's absolutely what I took it as but that's not necessarily a negative that's

215
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:14,420
 actually incredibly impressive. That's what he meant. So time person of the year is an interesting

216
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:19,380
 concept and also has not been time person of the year for very long so in fact at this time when

217
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:23,620
 it was time computer of the year it wasn't replacing the time person of the year tradition it was

218
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:29,540
 time man of the year. So it only got changed to time person of the year I think in 1999 before that it

219
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:36,180
 was always time man of the year except we should say three crucial occasions since the 1920s when an

220
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:42,820
 individual woman got time woman of the year. So Wallace Simpson got it 1936 and that was obviously

221
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:47,700
 because she's shagged up shagducking. And then in 1981 it was that woman who had sex with a hundred

222
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:57,060
 million men in America wasn't it? We were just so impressed. Between 1927 and 1999 when they

223
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:02,180
 changed it to person of the year individual woman won it the same number of times as Franklin D.

224
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:08,980
 Roosevelt the US president. Wow yeah. That's correct. Three is yeah. It was it was it was Queen Elizabeth

225
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:13,940
 as you say Wallace Simpson and the president of the Philippines. But it's not always good to get

226
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:19,300
 you know if you get it doesn't mean it's a mark of high standards. No no no and I think the point is

227
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,900
 because I think people have said this is a sexist award and it's not time magazine is just

228
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:28,420
 reflecting who has power and influence and what it reflected was that women had no power and

229
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:34,020
 influence and shamefully the third person who got it was Karazan Akino who was president of the

230
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:39,540
 Philippines who I knew nothing about but who was a definite good guy and what she did she over

231
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:45,060
 through Ferdinand Marcos I established kind of democracy in the Philippines or tried to and she

232
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:55,060
 got it in 1986 but it is a bad thing in that it shows what a I guess still milled world we live in.

233
00:17:55,060 --> 00:18:01,220
 Yeah so 1998 which is I guess the final year where it was man of the year it was given to two men

234
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:07,060
 which was Bill Clinton and Ken Star and Clinton not for good reasons it was for his role in the

235
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:12,340
 Clinton impeachment but the thing is is that in theory it should have gone to someone very different

236
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:17,860
 that year because they held their first online poll where they asked members of the public who do

237
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:24,020
 you think should be the man of the year and the winner with over 50% of the votes was a WWF

238
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:30,020
 wrestler called Mick Foley who plays a character called mankind who wears Mr. Socko a sock puppet on

239
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:36,020
 his hand and throws himself off high cages he got 50% of the vote but he was then pulled from the

240
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:40,660
 poll and they gave it to someone else but it turns out that the poll doesn't reflect who they give it to

241
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:45,620
 anyway it's a useless poll. Sure that's what they claimed after the poll when he won it we were never

242
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:50,500
 going to make this decide. Yeah that's so fun. That should have been the warning about Donald Trump

243
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:55,220
 shouldn't it that long ago and democracy the inevitable decline of democracy that we're seeing

244
00:18:55,220 --> 00:19:01,060
 today when people are voting for a WWF wrestler no offense I know you like WWF dad. Yeah Mick Foley's

245
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:06,580
 amazing. I think it was when Bell and Sebastian won a Bretter world for best newcomer instead of steps

246
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:10,500
 and that was done by the public I think that was when it all went wrong. Well look we've all got

247
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:16,580
 our moments where the rocks settle in our opinion. We can all just agree it's bad and weirdly

248
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:21,220
 that you mentioned Donald Trump because he's obviously got loads of history with Time Magazine so

249
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:26,500
 he was told off by Time Magazine for making up his own Time Magazine cover and putting it on the

250
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,820
 wall of his golf club. The magazine pointed out look at the date that you've put on this fake

251
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:35,140
 magazine Kate Winslet was actually on the cover and Trump has also claimed that he's been on the

252
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:39,700
 cover more times than anybody else which is not true. This is not person of the is just the cover

253
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:44,420
 of the magazine but it is a US president who's been on the front more than anyone else. Do you know who?

254
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:50,420
 Oh Baba. Oh Nixon. It's Nixon is rich Nixon he's been on about 55 times something crazy like that.

255
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:56,180
 Yeah actually it was Nixon's successor of course who was one of the only three presidents US

256
00:19:56,180 --> 00:20:01,540
 presidents who haven't been time person of the old time man of the year since it started so

257
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:06,100
 embarrassing and the first two were very early on so the first two were Coolidge and Hoover and we've

258
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:10,340
 talked about how relevant Coolidge was before and I think one of my favorite Dorothy Parker quotes

259
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:15,620
 when she was told that he died and she said something like how can they tell and so Coolidge and

260
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:20,260
 Hoover were pretty crap and then the other person the other poor president who didn't get on there ever

261
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:25,700
 was Gerald Ford and I hadn't realized about Gerald Ford that so famously he never won a US election

262
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:30,740
 of course he just stepped in as the replacement when Nixon had to go but he stepped in because he

263
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:35,940
 was VP I hadn't realized that he hadn't even won the election as VP the only reason he was vice

264
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:41,540
 president was that in 1973 Spira Agnew who had been vice president had to resign on completely

265
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:47,220
 different fraud and bribery related charges and so he stepped in as the default replacement as

266
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:52,340
 vice president and then found himself as the default replacement as president wow and really it's

267
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:57,220
 no surprise that he never quite met at the time person yeah I think the biggest slam in the time

268
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:03,460
 person of the year is from 2006 when the winner was you which basically means everyone was the winner

269
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:09,620
 and it was because people were you know making lots of content on the internet but then the runner

270
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:15,860
 up was president after dinner jadaviran so what I think that means is he doesn't count of the you

271
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:24,180
 part so everyone else in the world came first and he came second so the you the only people who

272
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:30,020
 qualify to be part of the you are people who were content providers before 2006 so that means

273
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:35,460
 if you had a my space account for example yes you uploaded anything then you qualify so I know that

274
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:42,660
 definitely three of us must qualify Anna have you even heard of the internet in 2006 look I was

275
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:48,740
 joined with up with dinner at second place and I'm comfortable with that okay um do you know

276
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:54,100
 started off as a mistake the time man of the year or it started off to rectify a mistake the

277
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:59,300
 magazine had made they were really embarrassed because in 1927 Charles Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic

278
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:05,460
 flew across it very big deal first time and they didn't put it on the cover they just completely

279
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:09,700
 flubbed it they put a picture of King George the Fifth and his wife in costume on the cover instead

280
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:15,140
 that week huge editorial blunder and they thought at the end of the year hey you know what we could do

281
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:19,620
 we could just say we've been saving up to call him the man of the year and that was how they started

282
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:24,180
 wow and the the profile of him is hilarious in that magazine because obviously there was still

283
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:29,540
 working out the form so the profile had you know word colon and that you know so they had feet

284
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:34,820
 large because when he arrived at the embassy in France there were no shoes big enough for him

285
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:40,660
 oh I thought you meant feet as an f-e-a-t I said what he did was the extreme we large feet

286
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:47,940
 no they they listed his habits they said smokes not drinks not does not gamble

287
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:52,260
 eats a thorough going breakfast avoids rich dishes they just went on like this

288
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:56,420
 these don't feel like the leading elements of Charles Lindbergh's character do they

289
00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:03,380
 large feet not smoke they also described him as a very taciturn person all the adjectives with

290
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:09,460
 things like modesty taciturnity diffidence women made in blush apparently singleness of purpose

291
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:16,900
 occasional curtness and flim although we do refer to being flagnastic these days we very rarely say

292
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:25,220
 that someone had he was he was part man part hackfish just the just back on computers for a second

293
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:30,980
 I was reading about the Lisa so this was the computer that was given as part of the machine of

294
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:38,340
 the year and Lisa had a problem so you know the Y2K problem yeah have you guys heard of the Y1995

295
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:47,940
 problem no why 1995 so this was Lisa for the same reasons that all computers had the problem with Y2K

296
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:54,340
 the Lisa computer only had a 15 year time limit so it was launched in 1981 for some reason they

297
00:23:54,340 --> 00:24:01,060
 backdated its time limit to 1980 and it only had 15 years to run before the clock freaked out and so

298
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:05,060
 that was a big problem for the Lisa computer it's not like Apple to create a product that becomes

299
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:11,940
 obsolete and that's true and that's why it wasn't a problem in the end that's why we haven't heard

300
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:19,380
 of the Y1995 and 1982 as well the first computer virus that went through personal computers from

301
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:23,620
 one to another to another there were a few viruses before that but this was the big one it was called

302
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:30,100
 the elk cloner and it was invented by Rich Screnta who was a 15 year old student and it's spread by

303
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:35,140
 floppy disk so he would put a game on a floppy disk give it to his friend and they would put it into

304
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:40,420
 their computer and after 50 times they played the game they get a blank screen and then a poem would

305
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:46,740
 come up saying it will get on all your disks it will infiltrate your chips yes it's the cloner

306
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:51,620
 and then it found itself a little place to live in your computer and then the next time you put

307
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:56,180
 another floppy disk on it would go on there and it's spread by floppy oh wow think about 15

308
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:59,700
 year olds is they're very good with computers but often they don't have a way with work what do you

309
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:05,540
 mean I haven't told you the second stands yet because it will stick to you like glue it will

310
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:12,180
 modify RAM 2 send in the cloner I think we can all agree he was the W.H. Jordan of the 1980s

311
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:20,020
 just one other thing that I found on computers specifically in 1982 for the first time ever a movie

312
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:27,220
 Tron had used computers to do CGI but they weren't nominated for an Oscar at that year's Oscars

313
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:32,500
 because the Academy saw it as cheating to have used a computer so no nomination and the best

314
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:37,700
 special effects went to ET for that device calling across the moon wow pretty that's pretty good

315
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,900
 and because they didn't use special effects they did manage to actually get someone to

316
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:45,700
 bicycle across the moon and then film it didn't they yeah they fired to them out of a massive cannon

317
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:52,500
 didn't they yeah that's small child what they did was that was a real moonshot that they'd taken

318
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:57,620
 and they used the load of charts and stuff to work out exactly when the best shot of a moon would be

319
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:03,140
 and where they had to go to America and they shot this amazing real scene and then they put green

320
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:08,020
 screen to put someone like a model of a bike going in front of it wait hang on because when you say

321
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:12,500
 moonshot moonshot has a different meaning doesn't it doesn't it doesn't it moonshot is oh this

322
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:16,900
 is a real moonshot you know it's just one one and a million attempt to do something I seem to

323
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:21,940
 meant it was a bare bottom I don't I haven't seen ET but I don't think it's a massive bare bottom that's

324
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:27,940
 that the you haven't seen ET you just told us an amazing story about the most famous shot in the

325
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:32,420
 entire film yeah well I I know all about it why would I watch it now I'm joke about I haven't seen

326
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:38,100
 that obviously like no that is criminal I'm just still shocked sometimes when you say that

327
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:41,700
 you haven't because I know you watch lots of films which are modern films yeah but I haven't

328
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:46,420
 watched them yeah I haven't seen either I feel like I'm too old I haven't seen ET I have to give

329
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:53,700
 you fair trade that same reaction yeah you can't see ET done I've seen at least three times on

330
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:58,580
 covering us all don't worry Andy nice I hope they don't give time perst of the air for everyone who's

331
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:14,180
 watched ET okay it is time for fact number three that is Anna my fact this week is that it

332
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:20,660
 ought to decide which direction to go and preach every day Franciscan spun round and round until

333
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:24,660
 they were so dizzy that they fell over and then went in whichever way their head was pointing

334
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:33,460
 this was just this was just a group of early Franciscan preachers so in the early 1200s who got into

335
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:39,540
 this and I learned this this is kind of transgressing in a way that we haven't transgressed before I'm

336
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:46,580
 bringing the adverts into the podcast because I learned this on a great courses course oh my god

337
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:52,020
 separate advertising believe that the rest of us do this I'm getting huge amount not to share

338
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:57,700
 this fact it's not even true no look I'm sorry I'm listening to this amazing lecture series it's by

339
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:02,020
 a guy called flip di leader who's it's a lecture series on the high middle ages and there was this

340
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:07,700
 bit about Franciscan monks and they are fascinating so the reason that they preached in this way was

341
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:11,700
 because they didn't really believe in planning for the future they thought that was all very sinful

342
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:16,900
 because God should decide what you do it's up to God everything you do and planning from the

343
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:21,460
 future is like you saying I know better than God and so you know they mustn't choose which direction

344
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:25,700
 they walk in they'll leave it to God and it was actually portrayed in a film wasn't it which I've

345
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:31,060
 never seen but I really want to call the flowers of St. Francis a Rosalini film where I think some

346
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:36,580
 Franciscans do it at some point I think St. Francis does it and in that I'm not showing that movie but

347
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:41,940
 the flowers of St. Francis was like pretty much a biography of St. Francis wasn't it yeah and so they

348
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:46,740
 say that he did it and that's why his followers did it right yeah yeah some Francis sounds like an

349
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:53,300
 interesting dude yeah apparently would sometimes strip to his pants while preaching his undergarments

350
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:58,820
 I'm not sure I don't think they had M and S. Y. France back in the day but he would give his clothes

351
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:03,460
 away and he played I haven't been able to find a more information about this he played a kind of

352
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:09,300
 proto guitar while preaching which have been condemned by the authorities and he played his own

353
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:14,420
 songs on it and he encouraged basically the red hot chili peppers isn't he getting down to his

354
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:20,100
 pants and playing a guitar in front of a massive crowd yeah I never thought of him like that but yeah

355
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:27,380
 I don't think he thought of himself like that yeah he was strange he converted according to one

356
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:32,180
 story when a crucifix spoke to him just hanging out in a church a crucifix said hey you need to go

357
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:36,580
 and rebuild this church roof so he thought well yeah the crucifix has told me I'll do it and he went

358
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:42,500
 and begged for money and stones to do that and his parents were very embarrassed by his crazy

359
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:48,180
 behaviour and his stripping down to his underwear and did a lot of weird stuff so when trying to

360
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:53,380
 work out what rules to include in the Franciscan order for his monks he just got a Bible and again

361
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:57,860
 because he loved the randomness he just said well randomly opened the Bible on three pages and the

362
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:03,460
 first three things we see will have them as the rules and fortunately they were quite good things

363
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:09,460
 even I think he must have done that a few times because the Bible is a very big book with a lot of

364
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:17,060
 craze yeah so weird shit yeah only everyone 13 goats on a Tuesday that we have to go and attack the

365
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:25,460
 K tonight a lot of his early attempts failed that's really interesting he didn't used to just

366
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:30,660
 exclusively preach to humans either he would preach to animals he would preach to birds yeah that's

367
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:34,980
 why he's famous for isn't it the most famous thing but really oh glad to glad to mention the

368
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:47,140
 most famous thing yeah he wants persuaded a wolf to stop attacking some locals the he came to an

369
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:52,260
 agreement whereby they would feed the wolf but that was due to his his great communication skills

370
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:58,500
 with animals I literally all I knew about him before this research was is sort of an image of a guy

371
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:04,660
 with a bird landing on his outstretched hand yeah the page of all these animals he went to the

372
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:11,540
 Middle East to try and stop the crusades from happening very bullsy he visited Saladin's nephew

373
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:16,340
 who was in charge of the defense against the Christian invaders and they spent a week talking and

374
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:21,540
 I had a really good summit about all sorts of stuff and Saladin's nephew was very impressed with him

375
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:28,100
 and then Francis went to speak to the cardinal who was in charge of the invasion effort cardinal

376
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:32,820
 pelagia's galvani and said look I've had a great summit with this guy and I think maybe you should

377
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:38,100
 call off this crusade and it did not work all right yeah so he went to the wrong guy he just got

378
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:44,260
 pissed with an nephew an irrelevant nephew for a week and then had his attempts rejected he

379
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:49,220
 um but he was a bit naive I think he sent a bunch of friends get some monks to go preaching in

380
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:53,780
 Germany so this was in Italy that the order started he sent 60 of his members to go preaching in

381
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:57,060
 Germany but because he weren't supposed to really plan for the future and you just had to trust

382
00:31:57,060 --> 00:32:05,620
 to God he said you don't need to learn German because if God wants you you will and so they turned up

383
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:11,300
 and they picked up that yeah was a thing that meant yes and that was it and so it was all fine

384
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:15,300
 while people were saying hey are you nice guys do you want a drink and they were like yeah yeah

385
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:20,260
 and then when they said are you guys heretics you guys criminals and they kept going yeah yeah

386
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:23,940
 and they all ended up sort of being arrested and then they turned to it they shut what they

387
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:28,420
 should have done is got a guide book and then opening it on a random page and just said whatever

388
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:33,140
 it said on the guide book I think we've got me asking my patient number right

389
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:39,780
 favorite thing that I read about Francis so one of the things that we have actually mentioned

390
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:43,700
 before is that he's accredited with creating the first nativity scene in case you missed that

391
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:48,660
 episode ages ago he's responsible for that used live animals to do it but my favorite thing is

392
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:55,220
 that he wants had to put a stop to something which was the dead body of a dead Franciscan was performing

393
00:32:55,220 --> 00:33:00,820
 too many miracles and it was causing traffic jams in the town basically where it was happening

394
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:05,380
 because just all these miracles kept happening so people kept coming so he had to pray for the miracles

395
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:12,020
 to stop because it was too chaotic and they did yeah that kind of miracles was it just like a hippopotamus

396
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:15,460
 appears in the middle of the road I don't know I guess it's someone who suddenly walk again

397
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:19,540
 you know that kind of stuff when you go near something that's of religious importance and so this

398
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:28,340
 was a no that's jumanji you're thinking right yes this is in james jumanji was a 1995 film much like

399
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:37,220
 ET I've watched jumanji it was came out last year oh my a heretic yeah this was a Franciscan

400
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:42,900
 called pita katini and this was in 1220 what kind of traffic jams could you have in 1220 I

401
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:49,140
 know I got human traffic I guess it was just it was not good for the area you can have a cart jam there

402
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:56,420
 was actually there was a cart filled with handfish slime three cars the Franciscans themselves they

403
00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:03,700
 got in trouble in 2001 for hiring a Milanese fashion designer to redesign their habit oh really

404
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:10,660
 they said the old one is too heavy and it was cliched that's fair isn't it I think I mean I guess

405
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:15,220
 whether cliched or not shouldn't be a worry when you're a monk yeah I think the point of Franciscans

406
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:19,700
 being entirely anti materialist and you know you don't really want to have any physical possession

407
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:25,140
 is to deploy a Milanese fashion designer well the new one they said it was meant to be simpler

408
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:30,500
 cleaner more dynamic and professional and it also had a breast pocket for a mobile phone

409
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:34,740
 and the other orders were very envious of the Franciscans but there was a bit of a kerfuffle about

410
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:41,620
 it here's another cliche about monks is the tonsure which is their haircut so they have like hair

411
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:46,500
 just going around the side of their head don't they and then it's all bowled on top and the reason

412
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:52,340
 that they have that is because they want to replicate the crown of thorns that Jesus was but there's

413
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:57,460
 loads of different versions of it and the Roman Catholic one is the one that most people won't

414
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:02,420
 recognize like friar tuck had and stuff that goes around like a crown of thorns but before that

415
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:08,260
 in Britain they had a Celtic one and it was basically you shaved a triangle in the top of your head

416
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:13,140
 so you had a massive triangular bold patch at the top of your head and you had no hair everywhere else

417
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:17,860
 and I just think that that sounds like that's the next thing in Milanese fashion houses isn't it

418
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:24,580
 a triangular bold patch I had no idea that that was a crown of thorns I thought it was to do with

419
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:31,060
 I thought it was just genetic male pattern boldness affects monks the same way it affects all of us

420
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:35,140
 yeah I mean it might be you know like when your sights go bold and then you start shaving your

421
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:40,740
 head it's like no no it's a crown of thorns honestly and another person with a haircut like that

422
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:47,060
 willy thorn interesting willy here's the the snooker player it's it's a very niche reference for

423
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:53,300
 a demographic of listers to those who think is a fish I'm not sure how many of them know who willy

424
00:35:53,300 --> 00:36:02,980
 thorn is but there are a couple of middle age men got foeing in there I found a few other bizarre

425
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:08,500
 people from that time so St Joseph of Cupertino he's an interesting character much like I was saying

426
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:14,020
 with the other guy Peter causing traffic with his constant miracles Cupertino had a problem where

427
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:19,620
 he was constantly flying so he was known as the flying saint and people if they'd mentioned Jesus

428
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:24,500
 he would just start levitating up and this was a constant thing that would happen and it became a

429
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:29,060
 problem in his life it was I'm not surprised yeah he is a preacher people are going to be mentioning

430
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:32,900
 Jesus all the time to him even if someone just hears their thumb with the hammer and says Jesus

431
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:37,540
 does he start floating yeah it got even worse for him it went if you started mentioning saints

432
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:42,500
 any saint he would start flying so it became very disruptive to the point where people didn't like it

433
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:47,140
 and they ostracized him they got rid of him and said you can't be part of this how did they do

434
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:52,180
 they they just keep going Jesus safe Jesus safe Jesus safe until he floated away so far they

435
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:56,740
 couldn't see him anymore yeah no he ended up in a monastery and they kept him in a cell by himself

436
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:01,460
 so he he must have done some other things wrong other than just floated but he's uh yeah so that

437
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:05,300
 was a problem um all four been kept in a cell as well he must have hit his head on the ceiling

438
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:11,460
 constantly and obviously once he hits it goes Jesus three hits it it's a horrible loop

439
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:16,580
 I like the fact that another one of the leading preachers at the time who actually ended up being

440
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:20,500
 labeled a heretic even though he was basically the same as Francis of Assisi was Waldo

441
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:27,220
 so wow the Waldenzians uh there was a big search for him wasn't there afterwards

442
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:31,540
 it was yeah he was always in crowds though right because he tried to huge crowds so

443
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:36,740
 right another guy St. Dennis have you heard of St. Dennis he had his head chopped off but continued

444
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:42,100
 to walk and preach afterwards and he was made the patron saint of headaches if you had your head

445
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:46,260
 cut off yeah would you have phantom head syndrome no I think you'd have phantom body

446
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:51,620
 syndrome wouldn't you yeah because you're magnus in the head part I don't think he lasted too long

447
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:57,060
 I think he picked up his head and walked for six kilometers and buried it and then fell down so

448
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:02,100
 I think he did last quite a long time if that's what he did I think that's much more impressive

449
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:07,060
 than I could handle that's true uh twirling monks are still a thing to a certain extent

450
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:13,780
 oh yeah yeah so uh in 2019 last year there was a Buddhist monk uh she was called Master Hu Yen

451
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:18,340
 she was in Taiwan and she was blessing a temple and you can see footage of her doing us a line

452
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:25,060
 and she blesses the temple by going along the red carpet up towards it twirling 150 times in a row

453
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:32,180
 wow unfortunately she then throws up and it's a less spiritual ending to the video than you would

454
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:36,260
 expect that would be a easier way of doing this some Francis thing wouldn't it it's like whatever

455
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:42,420
 direction the vomit goes follow it follow follow the fire your gender so there is a modern day

456
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:49,460
 follower of the Franciscan faith and this is in Brazil it's a lady she's a grandmother in Brazil

457
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:56,100
 and she as part of her faith would pray to Saint Anthony of Padua apart from her grandchildren

458
00:38:56,100 --> 00:39:01,620
 realized that she wasn't praying to a figurine of Saint Anthony of Padua at all she was praying to

459
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:08,900
 a figure of Elrond Lord of River Del Lord of the Rings and she'd been praying to this elf every

460
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:14,020
 single day for a couple of years and it turned out it was just an elf she had lovely pointy years

461
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:20,420
 at the end of it we need to move on in a sec guys I was just looking into other leading religious figures

462
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:25,460
 in this period and someone who's particularly amazing is Hildegard of Bingan so I didn't know much about

463
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:31,060
 her vaguely heard of her but she was this very very influential Christian mystic and she sort of

464
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:35,380
 traveled around a lot very unusual for a woman to independently travel around and used to draw

465
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:42,180
 these huge crowds she was a rock star and she was a composer she's actually the only person really

466
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:48,340
 whose music we still play from the Middle Ages so it's still played in song today and she was a

467
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:52,740
 philosopher she's like the founder of German natural history she was amazing and she was very religious

468
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:58,500
 none but she also invented her own language and I think it's the first person we have evidence of

469
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:03,700
 doing kind of what we did with Esperanto which is trying to invent a perfect language a new alphabet

470
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:09,140
 and we've got this whole glossary of her language that she wrote in it's over a thousand words

471
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:13,860
 and she just made up this language it's full of seds and it's really weird stuff like she's got a

472
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:19,140
 specific word for great great great great great grandfather and she's got you know drunkards

473
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:26,500
 vaginas urine she's made up her whole name she covered all the main the main subjects my drunk

474
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:31,220
 great great great great grandfather's got a vagina she could say that yeah and it's full of urine

475
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:42,100
 okay it is time for our final fact of the show and that is Andy my fact is that in 2004 a Canadian

476
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:46,980
 cheese maker dropped fifty thousand dollars worth of cheese into a lake to make it taste better

477
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:55,300
 but then lost the cheese oh no I know okay so that could possibly be like the most tasty bit of

478
00:40:55,300 --> 00:41:00,260
 cheese that's ever been made and we'll never find it I know after 15 years in the lake is

479
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:08,660
 probably approaching its peak so this was a Canadian cheese maker he ran a from a jury called

480
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:15,940
 La from a jury Boava he dropped 800 kilos of cheese into the water of this lake in 2004

481
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:21,540
 and he let it sit there for a year and he was really confident that it would be delicious once it

482
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:26,580
 had a bit of lake treatment but they started looking for it it wasn't in the spot they left it in

483
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:30,180
 and then they ramped up the search a bit so they started sending in divers and

484
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:35,060
 then they sent in some tracking equipment after three dives they still hadn't found the cheese

485
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:40,340
 and the cheese maker was called Luke Boava he said it got too expensive at some point you can't be

486
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:45,140
 crazy and they just called off the search so this is a phantom cheese that the world will never get

487
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:50,820
 to it so the reason that they thought to put all this cheese in the water is actually because

488
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:56,100
 a fisherman had come to them a few years earlier and said that he'd found a bit of their cheese

489
00:41:56,100 --> 00:42:01,060
 at the bottom of a lake now I don't know how that bit of cheese got there but he's found it

490
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:04,980
 and the first thing he thought when he got this cheese out of the lake is I'll just try it and see

491
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:10,100
 what it's like and he said it was the most tasty cheese that he'd ever had and so obviously this

492
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:14,020
 framachery guy thought well I'll just put all the rest of my cheese in the water

493
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:21,380
 this is the complex science on which framagia's depend is just the random word of a crazy

494
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:26,260
 fisherman who eats cheese off the bottom of the lake basically he just right the hag fish off

495
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:32,100
 and also they should have seen it coming right because wasn't the lake called a bada ha ha

496
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:36,580
 yes it's one of the few places in the world which has punctuation in the name of the place because

497
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:42,180
 ha ha has exclamation marks after it yeah yeah even if they had found the cheese there is

498
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:46,980
 serious doubt of whether they would have been able to sell it because the Canadian food inspection

499
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:51,220
 agency are real sticklers about just put dropping food in a lake and then selling it to the

500
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:56,420
 public and they said yeah we would have needed to check this throughout its age and process

501
00:42:56,420 --> 00:43:00,100
 yeah and then they interviewed afterwards one of the divers who was looking for the cheese

502
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:05,140
 a guy called Mr. Daffour and they said are you know are you not a bit sad that you didn't find the

503
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:11,300
 cheese he's like no I'm really optimistic because the Titanic sank in 1912 and it was only found

504
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:18,340
 in 1985 so as far as he's concerned there's still plenty of time to find this cheese

505
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:23,540
 I like the idea that the Oscar winning film in the year 2060 is going to be a film called Bravan's

506
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:28,340
 Cheese where they finally read the giant cheese from the bottom of the way I would have thought

507
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:33,860
 that would be better than Titanic because I haven't seen Titanic but surprise surprise you know

508
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:38,020
 what's going to happen at the end don't you whereas in this cheese it's an actual mystery of what

509
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:45,780
 happens at the end and I read also an article this was in was in 2005 Andy and so obviously in 2005

510
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:51,860
 it was quite a slow news yeah and so it was in the news a fair amount and then afterwards they said

511
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:57,140
 that he was going to do it again and he was going to fit the cheddar with a tracking device

512
00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:01,780
 so but then I couldn't find if he's actually done it and there's nothing on his website to say that

513
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:06,100
 he's done it so I don't know maybe he looked back to that quote that Andy gave us where he said

514
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:10,580
 at a certain point of crazy you've got to realize you've got to stop and turn around and he

515
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:17,060
 reflected a little bit on that he's the one million dollar multi beam sonar device to find this cheese

516
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:24,500
 what because amazing it's absolutely amazing it's basically the Canadian Nessie is this cheese yeah

517
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:31,780
 there is lots of when you're probing cheese or when you're trying to do experiments on cheese so

518
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:37,060
 there has been a new method developed in the last year in Uruguay Uruguay and scientists

519
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:42,580
 developed a method to non-destructively probe emintel cheese which is massive news for the industry

520
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:47,540
 does emintel have holes in it it does so surely it's easy to probe without destroying it you just go

521
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:51,780
 through one of the holes no there aren't holes on the outside because obviously it's right and I think

522
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:57,380
 you knew that and you were teasing me basically you need to measure when the eyes as they call the holes

523
00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:02,340
 are big enough and when they're at the right size the cheese is ripe and if it's too long then the

524
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:07,780
 eyes all merge into each other the cheese collapses disaster so you make a batch of cheese and to measure

525
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:14,020
 it normally you would need to sacrifice a wheel of cheese every time that's a lesser known bit of

526
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:20,420
 the Bible isn't it where they sacrifice a wheel of cheese Abraham it's a god I won't give you my son

527
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:27,940
 but I will give you this baby bell so anyway so normally you need to as I say sacrifice one of your

528
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:32,100
 precious cheeses every time you want to measure the bubble size but these Uruguay and scientists have

529
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:38,740
 invented a kind of magic cheese hammer it's kind of a sonic electrical probe which allows you to

530
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:45,460
 tell from the sound it's like a tuning fork if you like for cheese but they're very specialist

531
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:49,700
 instruments obviously and you need a lot of training to tell from the sound whether a cheese is ripe

532
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:55,700
 but the new method is an electrical hammer which allows any old schmo who doesn't have years of

533
00:45:55,700 --> 00:46:01,540
 training and expertise to tell the writers of the cheese without destroying it so this is big news

534
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:08,100
 I was in a cheese shop the other day no the other month in France when real hard to go outside

535
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:13,940
 and they had like the back room you could look into the back room and they had all the massive

536
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:19,300
 wheels of cheese you know like they're really really expensive aren't they and they use them as like

537
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:24,980
 lone collateral and stuff like that and it was just really amazing to see how big these massive

538
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:29,460
 wheels of cheese are because they're absolutely huge how big we're talking give us an animal

539
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:37,780
 I would say 350 weasels wow thank you that's huge that's done nothing for me

540
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:43,940
 is that an elephant what is that could we not pick one animal is that it's kind of a big really big

541
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:50,420
 big yeah or a small pony like a shetland pony but if you squashed it down into a circle yeah

542
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:56,420
 you cut your legs off you're bending the legs into the body and then making it into a circle either way

543
00:46:56,420 --> 00:47:01,700
 I think the authorities will be taking a close interest I'm actually the most interesting Canadian

544
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:07,780
 cheese I could find was a giant cheese the mammoth cheese this was prepared for the Chicago

545
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:12,660
 world's fur of 1893 but it came from Canada from Ontario which is one of its biggest cheese

546
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:20,660
 producing provinces and it weighed 9900 kilos which I was trying to see what that was the equivalent

547
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:26,580
 of and it's the equivalent of 144 average sized women how many is that in weasels

548
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:34,820
 you're gonna have to do the weasels to women conversion yourself that it's amazing it was an

549
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:39,300
 amazing undertaking they used milk from dairies all over the country all over Canada and they had

550
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:43,700
 a special railway car made because the first one they put it on it just fell through the bottle

551
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:50,820
 wow so they had to transport it by this railway from Ontario to Chicago and they had a cheese

552
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:54,820
 timetable which they sent ahead to all the stations so everyone in the stations between the two

553
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:59,540
 places flocked to their station when they checked the timetable for when the cheese was pulling in

554
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:04,340
 so that they could come and see it and by the time it got to Chicago it had so many thousands of

555
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:09,460
 signatures on it from the people who come to see it on the cheese on the blin and cheese they had to

556
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:14,980
 it was on the grind yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but that's still pretty so gross while the cheese

557
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:20,180
 was going on the train people were running alongside it signing it or it sounds like it must have

558
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:24,580
 stopped at the stations but I don't think anyone was boarding and it wouldn't have been a sold train

559
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:28,340
 just for the cheese you'd have a carriage for it wouldn't you would do no they probably just had

560
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:32,580
 a carriage you wouldn't send a whole train and just have all the other carriages empty and just

561
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:37,700
 one cheese in one carriage but also equally you wouldn't be like sat in carajay or be of a train

562
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:43,380
 and they have to climb around the massive cheese to get to the buffet cart that's true that is the

563
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:51,620
 buffet cart is it yeah what year was it Sanna? 1893 1893 okay because I found another mammoth cheese

564
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:57,780
 from 1866 which has also shipped around to Toronto in New York and I only know about it because of

565
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:01,860
 a famous poem that was running about it do you guys know the cheese poet of Canada? No

566
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:08,340
 this is a guy called James McIntyre acknowledged to be one of the worst poets ever he's born in the

567
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:13,860
 early 1800s and he was a poet but no one knew this until after he died he only got fame because he

568
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:20,420
 was included in collections with titles like very bad poetry which got him famous and his most famous

569
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:26,100
 poem is called ode to the mammoth cheese weighing over seven thousand pounds and as it is at James

570
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:32,500
 read some poetry I'll give you a quick extract we have seen the queen of cheese lying quietly at your

571
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:40,740
 ease gently fined by evening breeze thy fair form no flies dare seize all galley dressed soon you'll go

572
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:46,580
 to the provincial show to be admired by many a bow in the city of torrentu

573
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:53,700
 so to the mammoth cheese weighing over seven thousand pounds that is brilliant yeah that's another

574
00:49:53,700 --> 00:50:00,420
 one that should have started to compete another Canadian cheese craft you know craft cheese

575
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:06,180
 so just like this there Canadian and the guy who invented craft cheese was Canadian he invented

576
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:11,620
 pasteurized cheese which everyone wanted to call embalmed cheese when he first invented it

577
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:17,380
 because all the cheese makers thought you can't have this kind of industrial process making cheese

578
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:21,780
 it should only be our special cheeses that we make that you can sell and so you're going to have

579
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:25,140
 to call it embalmed cheese and then in the end they had to call it processed cheese of course

580
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:30,020
 but he fought against that and he had a business partner he was going to go out of business

581
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:35,300
 but he decided to have a business partner and he made Jesus Christ his business partner this is

582
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:40,020
 on the craft website if you go on there oh I didn't think Jesus had a very good head for business

583
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:47,620
 did you not say Jesus Christ I didn't say Jesus Christ but that's what he remarked himself as

584
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:54,180
 no it's on the website it says that basically he was doing really badly and then he decided to make

585
00:50:54,180 --> 00:51:00,340
 Jesus Christ his business partner he gave 25% of his personal profits to the church and suddenly

586
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:04,820
 everything picked up and he became really really popular and then a few years later he brought in

587
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:09,860
 his brother's Charles Herbert Frederick Norman and John into the business wow what a slam for the

588
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:18,020
 brother who's been invited after Jesus Christ we have God to thank for craft I was actually reading

589
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:23,540
 a there was a book written by a random guy who visited the craft family a few years ago and the

590
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:28,580
 family tradition says it's been passed down that the reason he got the inspiration to pair up with

591
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:33,780
 God slash Jesus as his business partner was when he was just he was selling cheese in Canada like

592
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:37,540
 one trotting around the streets in his cheese cart and the donkey that was pulling the wagon from

593
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:43,220
 which he was selling turned around to him and told him they had to make things right with God

594
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:47,860
 and get him involved in the company and it was only after the donkey spoke to him that

595
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:54,100
 he went into this very lucrative business partnership talking donkey it's basically Shrek

596
00:51:54,100 --> 00:52:00,580
 I mean I haven't seen Shrek but I think there is a topic donkey in it isn't there so annoying

597
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:07,220
 that you're basically with all the film references that is amazing we're going to have to wrap up

598
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:11,940
 in a second anyone got anything else they want to add before we do I like the the cyclops in the

599
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:20,580
 Odyssey basically ran a cheese factory just looking at old cheeses so he um if you look at the

600
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:25,140
 Odyssey from a different angle then Odysseus is really the villain here so he goes with all his

601
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:31,140
 men to the cyclops as big caves and so you probably know that the cyclops had a big sheep farm

602
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:34,980
 because the way they all escaped at the end is by clinging to the underside of this sheep as they

603
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:39,700
 counted out of the caves but basically all these men snuck into the cyclops as caves and they

604
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:44,900
 found that the cyclops has been milking all of his sheep and then keeping storing the milk in his caves

605
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:51,940
 kind of like rock forest is stored in order to mature into cheese and so they sort of stole the cheese

606
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:56,820
 from the caves and escaped but I just love the fact that the cyclops was just a cheese farmer

607
00:52:56,820 --> 00:53:02,900
 that story honestly the cyclops is the good guy and that story isn't he because they yeah they

608
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:08,100
 blind him he's only got one item to begin with and they blind him and then they steal all of his

609
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:14,260
 stuff I always hated that story you know they blind him so they hide underneath the sheep so they

610
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:18,820
 can't feel him because he feels the top of the sheep doesn't he I don't know I think that's sneaky

611
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:23,460
 and not very nice he is going to eat them isn't he are you specifically says when I come back

612
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:27,620
 I'm going to kill you and he's just nature but that's because they've eaten all of his cheese he's

613
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:32,500
 got nothing left to put in his images I think the theory is that it's um it's feta or that it's a

614
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:38,900
 kind of proto-feta if it's a cheese feta I think so yeah I weirdly don't know the story we've talked about

615
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:43,460
 it on this podcast I love that you do though James I love that there's a period where you stop

616
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:48,660
 taking stuff in but then you're far back and up and you pick it up again yeah

617
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:53,940
 it's very exciting we've just told you the story in such a weird order now I wonder what your head

618
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:59,300
 is like trying to piece together this is like moving the mental that I haven't seen where everything's

619
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:12,100
 in a weird order now okay that's it that is all of our facts thank you so much for listening if
