00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
 Hi everybody, just before we start this week's show, we have a bit of special news.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,680
 If you look at the episode number, we have done 300 podcasts.

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:14,880
 It is quite astounding, isn't it? Who would have thought it when we put that first episode out?

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,680
 And we accidentally said it was a weekly episode.

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,800
 The 300 weeks down the line, we would still be doing it.

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,000
 Thank you so much for continuing to listen if you have done.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,520
 If you start listening some time ago, you probably won't hear this bit, so don't worry about it.

8
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:33,680
 Another really exciting thing about the 300th episode, is it was recorded live in Vienna,

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,600
 of all places, because we got given an award.

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,120
 Yes, this is the Heinz Oberhume Award for Scientific Communication.

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,800
 Heinz Oberhume was a physicist, he was a great Austrian scientist communicator,

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,920
 and you know, just scientist, as well as anything else, and comedian.

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,080
 He very sadly died several years ago, but his colleagues have set up this award in his name,

14
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,920
 and we were honoured. We were so honoured to receive it.

15
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,440
 I really hope you enjoy the show, because we had a great time making it as well.

16
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,920
 We had a right good laugh on this episode.

17
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,080
 Are we going to say by the book this week?

18
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,320
 Do you mean, are we going to say, this is your last chance to buy the book of the year 2019,

19
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,680
 an incredible book full of the most interesting stuff that's happened across the entire planet this year?

20
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,880
 I wasn't going to say that, no.

21
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,080
 Yeah, I don't think we should say that.

22
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,200
 No, no, and I probably wouldn't explain the things that are in the book.

23
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,120
 Oh, what like the lawnmower records and the British government hunting down a single B

24
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,120
 and the women's log carp and all the amazing stuff?

25
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,720
 No, absolutely, we won't mention that at all.

26
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,120
 Great.

27
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,440
 Probably won't mention where you can buy the book.

28
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,440
 Uh, just the bookshop, isn't it, and online?

29
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,000
 Yeah, yeah.

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,480
 And we've already not mentioned the name of the book,

31
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,000
 but should we not mention it one more time?

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,280
 Oh, yeah, let's not mention that it is called the book of the year 2019.

33
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,960
 Okay, but let's definitely mention that this is our 300th episode.

34
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,800
 Okay, I'm on with the podcast.

35
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,320
 And Merry Christmas!

36
00:01:48,320 --> 00:02:06,800
 [BELL RINGING]

37
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,920
 Welcome to a very special 300th episode of no such thing as a fish,

38
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,600
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from the Heinz Oberhume award ceremony

39
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,040
 in Vienna, Austria!

40
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:24,080
 [APPLAUSE]

41
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,480
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

42
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,200
 I am sitting here with Anitazinski James Hark in Andrew Hunter Murray.

43
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,360
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts

44
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,800
 from the last seven days.

45
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,400
 And in no particular order, here we go.

46
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,760
 Starting with my fact, my fact this week is that the last TV show

47
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:51,200
 that the award-winning eminent physicist Heinz Oberhume made before he passed away

48
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,320
 was called The Universe is a shithole.

49
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,080
 [LAUGHTER]

50
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,200
 The whole universe?

51
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:57,600
 Uh--

52
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,680
 The whole universe is a shithole,

53
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,720
 according to a man who studied it his entire life.

54
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,080
 [LAUGHTER]

55
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,720
 This is-- I suppose some people in the audience will be aware of this show.

56
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,720
 It was also transformed into a book.

57
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,800
 This is the actual book here.

58
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,160
 "Dus universeum is thine shicek again?"

59
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,000
 [LAUGHTER]

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,480
 From the audience reaction, I'm not sure you quite caught that.

61
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,480
 [LAUGHTER]

62
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,840
 This was given to me by Heinz's wife, Doris.

63
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,400
 Thank you so much for this book.

64
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,000
 And yeah, so the reason we're mentioning this fact tonight is because

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,040
 we are actually the recipients of the award this year.

66
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,720
 We are the 2019 Oberhume recipients.

67
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,240
 It's very exciting for us.

68
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,560
 But he'd lost his faith in the universe by the end.

69
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,520
 Apparently.

70
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,320
 Why did he think it was such a shithole?

71
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,760
 OK, he was an amazing physicist.

72
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,120
 He was an astrophysicist.

73
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,320
 He was a nuclear physicist.

74
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,280
 This is a guy who had a whole career behind him

75
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,000
 of sort of doing proper amazing science.

76
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,400
 But he also had a fantastic sense of humor.

77
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,120
 And in the sort of later half of his career,

78
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,280
 he met a group who had given us this award tonight,

79
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,640
 the science busters who were a big Austrian collective

80
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,800
 of comedy geeks like us.

81
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,440
 And the whole thing was they would present ideas

82
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,600
 that were funny as well as being really interesting.

83
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,520
 And this idea was to do with the fact that the universe,

84
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,400
 it's such an inhospitable place.

85
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,960
 Everywhere you go in it is horrible.

86
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,320
 There's only a tiny little bit of it that is quite nice.

87
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,440
 Earth being one, the rest of it, shithole.

88
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,080
 Yeah, if you got dropped anywhere in the universe,

89
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,600
 the chances are you would die almost immediately, right?

90
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,480
 So you're probably not going to end up on a planet.

91
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,160
 You might be in the middle of space.

92
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,160
 You might be in the middle of a star, in which case,

93
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,960
 you're almost certainly going to die.

94
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,600
 Almost, almost certainly.

95
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,000
 You are confident sometimes about your own chances.

96
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,600
 People from the north of England are very confident.

97
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,400
 No, because Carl Sagan, the famous Carl Sagan,

98
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,520
 the scientist, he wrote that space is so empty

99
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,720
 that if you were randomly inserted into the universe,

100
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,600
 your chance of being on or near a planet is 10 to the power of 33,

101
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,320
 or one against that, which is 10 followed by 32 zeros.

102
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,280
 And to put that into perspective, if you were to take every bacteria on Earth

103
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,160
 and put it in a random place in the universe,

104
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,880
 and you did it every single day for a year,

105
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,840
 only one of them would end up on a planet.

106
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,960
 Whoa! And that's even on a planet, not even on Earth.

107
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,440
 No, it's very unlikely to be Earth.

108
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,440
 I mean, it's so annoying for the bacteria,

109
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,400
 because they're on Earth to start with.

110
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,400
 What kind of a weird prank was this?

111
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,400
 It was a terrible package holiday company for bacteria only.

112
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,840
 And it's not just planets, is it?

113
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,600
 It's anything as well.

114
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,760
 So the chances are you would have nothing around you.

115
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,680
 The universe is almost entirely made up of what are called voids,

116
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,080
 which is just a fancy word for nothing.

117
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,560
 And so I didn't really realise this,

118
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,840
 but if you really zoom out on the universe, which is hard to do,

119
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,080
 then it basically looks like a cobweb.

120
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,920
 It's connected by threads of galaxies, where all the stuff is.

121
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,920
 So the stars, the planets, the moons, the nebulae,

122
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,080
 and the rest of it is literally nothing.

123
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,280
 The occasional blob of helium, maybe,

124
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,360
 if you're really lucky on an exciting day.

125
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,400
 So I was looking at ways of improving the universe,

126
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,160
 and some people have done some calculations on what would happen.

127
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,160
 So if you filled the whole universe with breathable air,

128
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,600
 you would think this is a good move.

129
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,600
 It would collapse within 24 hours.

130
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,040
 Oh, nightmare.

131
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,080
 Nightmare, yeah.

132
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,080
 Also, let's just shrink it down.

133
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,800
 If you filled up the solar system with air,

134
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,240
 what we think would happen is that because there would be air

135
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,160
 in the 93 million miles between Earth and the Sun,

136
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,920
 the Sun would be loud enough,

137
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,400
 because there are all these air molecules to pass on the Sun.

138
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,680
 It would be loud enough to cause you physical injury.

139
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,600
 It would be like having a train horn one metre from your head,

140
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,960
 all the time, all the time, right?

141
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,120
 But you wouldn't be able to see it,

142
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,640
 because the air would be so thick for 93 million miles

143
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,400
 that you wouldn't see what was making the noise, right?

144
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,840
 But does it matter if you can see it?

145
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,880
 What are you going to turn that?

146
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,800
 What are you, what are you...

147
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,280
 I think it is quite important that the light from the Sun

148
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,040
 reaches our planet.

149
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,680
 I'm really happy about that, yeah.

150
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,080
 The kind of, like, that defeats the whole object of the Sun, right?

151
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,120
 We don't want it for its night.

152
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,400
 But it would still be very hot.

153
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,280
 It would be very, very hot and loud and dark.

154
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,320
 And dark, yeah.

155
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,080
 It's like being in a nightclub forever.

156
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,920
 So we've got it good.

157
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,720
 We've got it good.

158
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,720
 We've got it good because, like Andy was saying,

159
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,560
 if you ended up on a planet,

160
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,920
 the likelihood is it won't be as nice a planet as Earth.

161
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,760
 So, for instance, there is a planet called Corot 7b,

162
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,440
 where it's always raining,

163
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,120
 but it's always raining rocks.

164
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,120
 And the temperature is around 2,800 Kelvin,

165
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,000
 which is almost 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit.

166
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,240
 But the one good thing about it

167
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,240
 is it's so close to its star

168
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,440
 that the year lasts only 20 hours.

169
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,000
 And so that means it's your birthday every day.

170
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,160
 Oh, that's cool.

171
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,240
 But it's also New Year's Day every day,

172
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,080
 and you're so hungover every day

173
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,760
 from New Year's Eve the night before.

174
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,920
 I found a planet that would be horrible to land on as well

175
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,440
 if you got there by chance.

176
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,920
 It's called HD189773B.

177
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,440
 Very catchy name.

178
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,480
 It's 63 light years away from us.

179
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,640
 And one of the main issues with it

180
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,960
 is that it's raining a lot,

181
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,080
 but the rain doesn't go vertically down.

182
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,920
 It goes horizontally across the planet.

183
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,640
 It's not so bad.

184
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,640
 We get that in England sometimes.

185
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,680
 We do get that.

186
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,080
 The problem is that the surface temperatures

187
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,240
 is such that the particles condensed to form glass.

188
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,880
 So it rains, shards of glass,

189
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,640
 at 4,000 miles an hour,

190
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,240
 constantly around the planet.

191
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,240
 Be birthed out, to out.

192
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,560
 Let's go back to rock planet.

193
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,880
 I was looking at other things that could happen.

194
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,280
 There'd be a bit catastrophic in the universe.

195
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,360
 And do you know what would happen

196
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,800
 if the moon turned into a black hole

197
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,520
 with the exact mass of the moon?

198
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,880
 OK, I'm going to say bad.

199
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,920
 Just bad things would happen.

200
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,480
 That's fair, it's a fair point.

201
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,560
 So black holes are usually quite big.

202
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,200
 Remnants of massive, massive stars

203
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,080
 that have had this huge exotic death

204
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,600
 and then collapse it on themselves.

205
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,440
 So that's a black hole usually.

206
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,800
 But then they've got this enormous mass.

207
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,360
 And so if there's a black hole with the same mass

208
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,400
 as a moon, they've got this enormous density story.

209
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,440
 That would be extremely, extremely small.

210
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,360
 But it would pull everything that came quite near it towards it.

211
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,360
 But other than that, nothing would happen.

212
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,640
 So round and round road did this.

213
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,520
 The moon would disappear.

214
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,680
 We wouldn't see the moon.

215
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,400
 Because it's got the same mass as the moon had.

216
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,440
 It's just a little black hole.

217
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,840
 The only thing that would happen is there'd be a tiny little black hole.

218
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,160
 And if a little bit of dust was drifting past it,

219
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,600
 it would get sucked in.

220
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,520
 OK, the world line or something.

221
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,320
 The world would be less romantic without the moon.

222
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,120
 We would be less romantic, yes.

223
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,840
 And we do get a bit of heating from the moon, so that would go.

224
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,280
 And so that would put off global warming by about two weeks.

225
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,080
 Oh, right.

226
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:29,200
 So this is really a last plan to deal with global warming.

227
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,120
 The emergency.

228
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,320
 Imagine the extinction rebellion if this was their plan

229
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,160
 that they revealed after all these protests.

230
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,760
 Turn that moon into a black hole.

231
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,520
 Two more weeks.

232
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,320
 One bad thing that could happen in the universe

233
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,800
 is the entire universe could die due to a massive bubble.

234
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,800
 OK, this is a thing that astronomers have looked into

235
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,320
 is called death by bubble, just what it says on the tin.

236
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:56,840
 Yeah.

237
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,360
 And the idea is quite complicated.

238
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,600
 But the idea is that the universe is at a certain energy level.

239
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,160
 And that is not the lowest energy level it could possibly

240
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:05,640
 be in.

241
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,960
 And due to quantum physics, it might go down one level.

242
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,480
 And then there would be a massive bubble.

243
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,200
 And it would just eat up everything in the universe.

244
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,520
 And there was a new paper published in the journal Physical Review D.

245
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,000
 And they said they worked out when this is going to happen.

246
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,620
 So the universe may be killed by a death bubble somewhere

247
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:30,040
 between 10 octodacillian years, which is a one with 58 zeros

248
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:35,400
 after it, and 10 Quinn Quadrat-Gin-Tillian years, which

249
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:39,440
 is one with 139 zeros after it.

250
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,480
 And according to the lead author, that is a very, very,

251
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:50,520
 very, very, very, very, very, very, long time.

252
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,360
 So is that just the range of when it's going to happen?

253
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,360
 Yeah.

254
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,040
 It's like a delivery slot from a supermarket.

255
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:03,200
 So the thing we're talking about--

256
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,800
 this is Heinz Oberhommer's sort of big work, wasn't it,

257
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,440
 when he was sort of in his proper science stage?

258
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,440
 Yeah, so a lot of his works were more

259
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,720
 about the fine tuning of the universe.

260
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,200
 So for instance, the fact that you have certain particles

261
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,880
 in stars, and if the forces between them

262
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,800
 was changed, even by something like 0.4%,

263
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,240
 complete life would be completely impossible.

264
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,480
 The stars would-- which currently make carbon and oxygen,

265
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,920
 they'd either make just carbon or just oxygen.

266
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,800
 So we wouldn't be able to have any life whatsoever.

267
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,160
 And it's all about the unlikely hood of life

268
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,680
 and the unlikely hood of all this.

269
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,680
 Yeah.

270
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,000
 But then there is also a likelihood of life

271
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,680
 given the size of the universe, right?

272
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,400
 According to a lot of scientists.

273
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,400
 But then the bad news about that is, if we ever bump into it,

274
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,160
 it'll probably want to kill us.

275
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,520
 So it seems like Stephen Hawking's final warning

276
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,040
 before he died was that, if we meet aliens,

277
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,640
 they're going to want to destroy us all,

278
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,440
 because the chances are, if an alien gets to us,

279
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,480
 they're a nomadic alien.

280
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,400
 They're looking for land, otherwise, why have they left?

281
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,160
 And if they're looking for land, they're going to wipe us off

282
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:07,680
 their land.

283
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,760
 It's basically, we've set an example constantly

284
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,120
 throughout history by going to different countries,

285
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,000
 and then conquering those.

286
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,120
 They're going to do the same to us.

287
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,480
 We need to be advertising to the aliens that it's all a shithole.

288
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,000
 And then they want to come here.

289
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,920
 Exactly.

290
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,680
 Heinz's master plan.

291
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,040
 Could I tell you quickly, my favorite fact about Heinz?

292
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,880
 Yes, please.

293
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:34,440
 He, Oberhuma, was a word when he was doing speeches in English

294
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,200
 that he would say to the audience.

295
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,120
 This might be a word that you find hard to pronounce.

296
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,840
 So why didn't you call me by my other name, which

297
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,320
 is the translation of that.

298
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,160
 I go by Chief Lobster.

299
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:47,960
 Wow.

300
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,800
 Chief Lobster.

301
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,800
 Huma Lobster and Oberhuma being a sort of chief character.

302
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,440
 So yeah, so he wanted to be known as Chief Lobster.

303
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,920
 And apparently, he used to do gigs like the gig we're doing

304
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,400
 right now, in front of an audience.

305
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,960
 And he always used to get really hungry.

306
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,880
 And after getting really hungry after a gig,

307
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,160
 he'd go and find a sausage stand, which was out after the gig.

308
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,280
 And one night, it was too late.

309
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,160
 And the sausage stand was shut.

310
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,600
 And he had no choice but to go to a Burger King.

311
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,080
 And he was like, I don't want to go to a Burger King.

312
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,200
 Is this when he realized the universe is a shit hole?

313
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,280
 No, apparently, he went into this Burger King.

314
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,480
 And suddenly, because in Austria, he's such a famous name.

315
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,440
 But kids love him.

316
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,000
 He's such a great communicator.

317
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,600
 Everyone in the Burger King queue was like,

318
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,320
 hi, oh my god, it's hi, it's all over.

319
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,680
 Oh my god, this is amazing.

320
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:37,760
 So from then on, after every gig, he found the local Burger King.

321
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,680
 And made sure that he was recognized by everyone at side.

322
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,680
 And I think my favorite thing from this award

323
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,040
 is that we have been given.

324
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,600
 The actual award itself is from a farm that his family runs,

325
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,200
 which is alpacas.

326
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,200
 And these alpacas, obviously, have poos.

327
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,600
 And our trophy tonight is a collection of their poo.

328
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,040
 That is the award, which is unbelievable.

329
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,240
 [LAUGHTER]

330
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,560
 And we saw it being made.

331
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,640
 We saw our trophies being made.

332
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:12,920
 Or while we saw an alpaca having a poo, who knows?

333
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,560
 In fact, I think we helped next year's trophy be made.

334
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:19,200
 Because we were invited to see these alpacas and meet them.

335
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,000
 And they're amazing.

336
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,120
 And we fed them.

337
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,800
 So actually, next year's winner hopefully

338
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,880
 will thank us for contributing to the making of their trophy.

339
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,160
 Because that's only going to come out the other end.

340
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,000
 You'd assume.

341
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,920
 Amazing creatures, though.

342
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,560
 I've never seen an alpaca before.

343
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,120
 They're very cool.

344
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:40,800
 I was reading a little about their habits and their lifestyle.

345
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,880
 And one thing they do.

346
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,520
 So there's a way you can tell if a female alpaca is pregnant.

347
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,040
 And there are some scientific ways you can tell, obviously,

348
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,440
 with an ultrasound.

349
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,560
 But you can also tell with a behavioral test.

350
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,160
 And all you have to do is introduce a male alpaca

351
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,080
 into the same space.

352
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,120
 And when the male approaches the female,

353
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:09,080
 if the female is pregnant, she will spit in his face.

354
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,120
 That is how you know that the female is pregnant.

355
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,080
 And they can do it consistently.

356
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,520
 They can do it with accuracy.

357
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:19,320
 They get it exactly right every time.

358
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,200
 But then they get sour mouth, right?

359
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,720
 This is an alpaca piece of terminology.

360
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,680
 Because their spit tastes very sour and disgusting.

361
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,320
 But they do need to spit sometimes.

362
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,960
 And so then they get this loose, floppy lower lip.

363
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,520
 So you know when you see them sort of exposing their lower teeth,

364
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,800
 they look a bit gormless.

365
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,880
 That's because the taste in their mouth is so foul.

366
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,920
 It's too bitter for them.

367
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,760
 But that will teach them not to spit in the first place, really.

368
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:48,080
 Another bit of alpaca terminology is the ogle.

369
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,600
 And this is a sound that alpacas make when they're ready to mate.

370
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,920
 And it's really-- you've got to listen to it on the internet.

371
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,600
 It's absolutely amazing.

372
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,360
 It's been described as like a rusty jazz trumpeter

373
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,280
 attempting to play a solo inside a swimming pool.

374
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,120
 Awesome.

375
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,160
 James, I don't have a very good imagination.

376
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,160
 I just wonder, as you've heard this sound,

377
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,280
 could you just give us something close to it?

378
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,080
 Go on, right?

379
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,280
 Go on.

380
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:25,840
 OK, if there's any alpacas in the audience,

381
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,520
 you're about to get very excited.

382
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:34,280
 And then you go, is something like-- that's really good.

383
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,080
 You very impressive.

384
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:37,760
 That's fantastic.

385
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:44,840
 I think my favorite terminal-- so how is your career going, James?

386
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:49,560
 Well, I was on stage in VMA doing an impression of a horny alpaca.

387
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:56,320
 My favorite terminology, we were just talking terminology,

388
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,160
 is that when an alpaca gives birth, that's called unpacking.

389
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,440
 I hope that's true.

390
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,000
 What might that sound like?

391
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,360
 Yeah, they're incredible.

392
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,200
 Am I right in saying that they can kind of--

393
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,200
 the females can ovulate on command?

394
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,560
 I think they have to be stimulated by a male.

395
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:24,120
 So yeah, when they're contacted by the male member--

396
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,560
 but it can't be that you go up to a female alpaca and just say,

397
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,560
 ovulate, and she just does it.

398
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,760
 When Guardian, ovulate?

399
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,840
 Yeah, I can't.

400
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,960
 And that was actually way over whom his family kicked us off

401
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,280
 the farm yesterday.

402
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,560
 Yeah, sorry to the family for that.

403
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,760
 There is one alpaca in the world which can surf.

404
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,760
 Cool.

405
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,400
 Are you talking about surfing on water or on the internet?

406
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,360
 On water.

407
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,040
 On water.

408
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,320
 There is a Peruvian surfer, Domingo Pianese,

409
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,560
 and he has taken his alpaca to the Pacific Ocean.

410
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,080
 And he put it in a flotation vest.

411
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,280
 It's called Pisco.

412
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,080
 And it's not great at surfing.

413
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:10,240
 But it is able to kneel on the board for a little while.

414
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,800
 Well, I think--

415
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,560
 yeah, Pianese said about it.

416
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,440
 He was asked about it.

417
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,120
 He said, I've surfed with a dog, a parrot, a hamster,

418
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,360
 and a cat.

419
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,080
 But I was at a competition in Australia,

420
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,680
 and I saw people surfing with kangaroos and koalas.

421
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,360
 So I thought it would be interesting to surf

422
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,560
 with an animal that represents Peru.

423
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,240
 Cool.

424
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,080
 Yeah.

425
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,640
 Poor alpaca.

426
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,640
 Yeah.

427
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,680
 We're going to have to move on to our next fact in a second.

428
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,640
 I was just reading a little bit about--

429
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,600
 because they're Peruvian and they're related to llamas,

430
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,160
 they're camelids, closely related to their larger cousin.

431
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:47,120
 And the Imerra people of Bolivia and Peru

432
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,040
 have interacted very closely with alpacas

433
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,360
 and al-Anlamas for a while.

434
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,280
 And I stumbled upon a book in this research

435
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,520
 describing how they would use them.

436
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,560
 And this book said that alpaca--

437
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,680
 the alpaca actually had a very often

438
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,760
 had a disease that was very similar to syphilis

439
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,800
 in symptoms, which I thought was weird.

440
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,960
 And then it said, whether this was communicated

441
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,960
 from alpaca to man or vice versa is an open one.

442
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,840
 [LAUGHTER]

443
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,840
 What?

444
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,840
 And then I checked, and it was written in 1870,

445
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,120
 and I think they had different ideas.

446
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,360
 But the other thing in this book also

447
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,720
 said, apparently, llamas, if offended,

448
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,320
 will stomp their foot with rage like a woman.

449
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,800
 [LAUGHTER]

450
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,000
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

451
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,480
 OK, it is time for fact number two.

452
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,760
 And that is Chazinsky.

453
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,040
 My fact this week is that early laser eye surgery

454
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,760
 was performed in a trailer next to a trash compactor

455
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,000
 that whenever it was switched on would

456
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,600
 vibrate the trailer as the doctors were trying to operate.

457
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,040
 Well, I don't know if you're familiar

458
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,400
 with how laser eye surgery works, but it's

459
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,200
 quite a particular process that requires a steady hand

460
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,120
 and a lack of serious vibrations of the room that you're

461
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,280
 standing in.

462
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,680
 I think anything that has a laser and an eye involved,

463
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,560
 probably you don't want it to be vibrating.

464
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,280
 Yeah, was that wobbling?

465
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,080
 I don't worry about it.

466
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,760
 So this is in 1988, and this was straight

467
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,880
 after the first ever successful laser eye surgery on a human.

468
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,000
 A lab was created in Louisiana State University School of Medicine.

469
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,360
 But they were scared about sort of radiation

470
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,520
 from the laser going into the main building,

471
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,200
 so they made them have it in this caravan, basically.

472
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,960
 Next to this massive vibrating machine,

473
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,160
 and a rubbish compactor is just a huge machine

474
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,920
 which crushes down shed loads of rubbish.

475
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,040
 As it would turn on every 10 minutes, vibrate the trailer.

476
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,160
 And the doctor doing the surgery got really annoyed

477
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,040
 and said, this is screwing up my surgery.

478
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,640
 And the company, the trash company,

479
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,440
 refused to close the compactor.

480
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,480
 And so the doctor, Marguerite McDonald,

481
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,440
 did a study to prove that it was damaging the medical outcomes

482
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,920
 these vibrations.

483
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,880
 That's--

484
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,640
 What was the study?

485
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,640
 Well, it--

486
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,360
 She didn't operate on 100 people,

487
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,600
 and then ruined 10 operations.

488
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,720
 You really want to be part of the control group.

489
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,000
 [LAUGHTER]

490
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,160
 She used the evidence from the people

491
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,640
 who'd been in the vibrating room and saw,

492
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,680
 if their eyes had accidentally been gouged out

493
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,480
 in the process or anything.

494
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,160
 And to her astonishment, she found out

495
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,360
 that the people who'd been operated on when the room was

496
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,720
 vibrating had actually done better.

497
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,800
 The surgery had been more successful

498
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,320
 than when it wasn't vibrating.

499
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:31,840
 What?

500
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,360
 And this was a crucial part of laser eye surgery science.

501
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,400
 They realized that basically when the laser is sort of scraping

502
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,440
 the top of your cornea off, then it had

503
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,360
 to go up and down to make the incision.

504
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,400
 And it was going up and down about 40 times a minute.

505
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,120
 And that was actually turned out it was a bit too jerky.

506
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,920
 But when you added in the vibrations

507
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,120
 of the big rubbish dump next door,

508
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,480
 it sort of smoothed it out a bit.

509
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,240
 Oh, I can't believe that.

510
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,840
 Because these days, when you have laser eye surgery,

511
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,160
 they're not doing it when there's a earthquake going on.

512
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:07,800
 So what they did was they sped up the laser vibrations.

513
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,400
 So they said, well, obviously, it's working.

514
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,760
 And we can't guarantee we'll always have this rubbish thing here.

515
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,160
 So they made the laser go up and down a bit faster.

516
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,160
 That's extraordinary.

517
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,040
 Is there a thing, do we know, whereby

518
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,600
 if it was a bit faster, the compactor a bit slow?

519
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,320
 Was it the Goldilocks kind of amount of vibration?

520
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,800
 Oh, I don't know if it was just the right amount of purge.

521
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,240
 I think it was just important that it

522
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:33,040
 vibrated a bit more to make it less jerky, so mad.

523
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,880
 Oh, she is amazing.

524
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,040
 She's still alive, isn't she?

525
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,640
 My Greek McDonald.

526
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:42,240
 And I think she was the first person to do laser eye surgery.

527
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,160
 Is that right?

528
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:43,840
 Yes.

529
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,520
 I think she might have operated on the first lady as well.

530
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,760
 So the first lady was a patient called Alberta Cassidy,

531
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,080
 who'd been just diagnosed with melanoma of her eye.

532
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,800
 And they were going to have to remove it.

533
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,520
 But before they did, so she was so amazing.

534
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,680
 She just basically said, if anyone wants

535
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,600
 to do any experiments on this eye while it's here,

536
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,480
 then you can do it.

537
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,240
 And they rushed her in, and they did the operation.

538
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:06,920
 Wow.

539
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,000
 She was very cool.

540
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,360
 And she Alberta Cassidy knew--

541
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,280
 sort of had what they called a dire prognosis.

542
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,520
 And she did, in fact, die a few months later.

543
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,000
 But she volunteered herself.

544
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,960
 Yeah, so they rushed her into a primate center,

545
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,040
 because that was the only place they were doing laser eye

546
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,320
 surgery at the time.

547
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,520
 And so she laid down on a bed and had to ice-laced alongside

548
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:31,840
 the shrieking and crying out monkeys and primates.

549
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,120
 Presumably quite off-putting, but yeah, and it works.

550
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:35,720
 Yeah, it was on--

551
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,680
 Maybe the vibrations of the shrieking might have helped.

552
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,800
 Yeah.

553
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:44,720
 Now every laser eye operation, you have a chimpanzee next to you.

554
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,280
 Some of the first surgery-- a laser eye surgery--

555
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,360
 was done on turkey dinners.

556
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,400
 So they were trying to test the lasers in the first place.

557
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,000
 This is before they even got to operating on any humans

558
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 or any animals.

559
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,760
 There was a doctor called Rangaswami Srinivasan.

560
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,360
 And he was one of the pioneers, because the lasers they were

561
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,920
 using were normally for carving computer chips

562
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,440
 in the right shape.

563
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,280
 And they thought, maybe we can use this for a medicinal purpose

564
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,200
 somehow.

565
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,240
 And so this doctor, Srinivasan, he brought his leftovers

566
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:21,320
 from his Thanksgiving dinner in, just a leftover turkey dinner.

567
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,680
 And they practiced etching patterns

568
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,920
 in the cartilage and on the bones and on the skin and all

569
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,400
 of this.

570
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,440
 So yeah, yeah.

571
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,800
 This was how they developed it the early days.

572
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,240
 There was another part of development of laser eye surgery

573
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,640
 was a boy smashed his glasses into his face.

574
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,920
 So he fell over and the glass went all over his eyes.

575
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,640
 And it made his eyes better.

576
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,080
 Yeah, I mean, this is a thing.

577
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,440
 So there was a Russian surgeon who dealt with him

578
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:58,960
 called Dr. Odir, OK, is Dr. F. And he--

579
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,560
 I think he was Dr. Fyodorov, maybe?

580
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:05,840
 Yes, he was Dr. Fyodorodov.

581
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,840
 And--

582
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,400
 Yes, that's what I said.

583
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,240
 A Fyodorov.

584
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,040
 So he was treating a near-sided boy, who'd fallen.

585
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,800
 He'd fallen over these glass shards had gone into his eye.

586
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,400
 And the damage was minimal.

587
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,360
 But what it did was a sliver of the glass had shaved off

588
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:24,000
 a bit of the top layer of his eye, which largely what

589
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,040
 laser eye surgery is now is to sort of reshape the eye.

590
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,320
 It reshaped the eye.

591
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,040
 So while they were studying him, he was like,

592
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,360
 I can see everything now.

593
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,000
 And that's what made them realize, OK, this is where we have to get--

594
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,560
 we just got to start shaving eyes.

595
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:39,160
 And so if you can't afford laser eye surgery--

596
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,440
 No, no, no, no.

597
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,280
 We can't recommend that.

598
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,440
 We can't recommend anything.

599
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:48,480
 Because, actually, I don't know if you guys saw in the news this year.

600
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,120
 Do you know the pop star or the singer Grimes?

601
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,120
 Yeah, Grimes, yeah.

602
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,880
 Who was a partner of Elon Musk?

603
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,920
 Well, she apparently has had laser eye surgery

604
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:03,320
 that blocks out the color blue, whenever she's looking at things.

605
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:07,400
 And the idea is that she suffers from seasonal affective disorder.

606
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,240
 And by getting rid of the blue light,

607
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,880
 it'll make her feel better and feel less sad.

608
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,560
 OK.

609
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:16,800
 Now, I went on the website, lookafteryoureyes.org.

610
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:21,480
 And they said, this surgery is not supported by scientific evidence.

611
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:21,960
 Yeah.

612
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,680
 So whatever you do, don't do that.

613
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:27,280
 Well, how does she know where the sky is anymore?

614
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,800
 It's in the same place as where she left it.

615
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,440
 Well, when she goes swimming, how does she know which bit is the sea,

616
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,400
 which bit is the sky?

617
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:41,200
 Andy, Andy, did the FAQs for why you shouldn't have this surgery?

618
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,320
 Do you think that when you're swimming towards a horizon,

619
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,200
 if you keep going, eventually you start swimming into the sky?

620
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,240
 Like that.

621
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,400
 And anyway, both those things are blue.

622
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,520
 So if you can't see blue, you can't tell the difference,

623
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,880
 but you can't tell the difference anyway, because they're both blue.

624
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,680
 That's true.

625
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,080
 I can't believe--

626
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,240
 I can't believe I said that.

627
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,880
 [LAUGHTER]

628
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,760
 Well, at least we're not recording it, so you're fine.

629
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,680
 This is supposed to be about science communication.

630
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:17,440
 We're going to take our shit away from us, Andy.

631
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,200
 Monet couldn't see the colour blue, you know?

632
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:19,720
 Couldn't be.

633
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,720
 Well, I've got a question about Monet.

634
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,680
 And that's why he drowned trying to swim in the sky.

635
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,080
 He had a cataracts.

636
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:32,120
 [APPLAUSE]

637
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,200
 He had cataracts.

638
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,880
 And actually, a lot of people say this is why his paintings were so blurry,

639
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,320
 and because his vision was quite blurry,

640
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,120
 because when he went into a really blurry phase,

641
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,600
 it was because he had eye problems, which when they were fixed,

642
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,320
 meant that he looked at all the paintings he'd done,

643
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,120
 and sort of tore most of them up and shut them away,

644
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,880
 saying, well, these were blurry, they're shit.

645
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,400
 Oh, no.

646
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,120
 Why have you been saying they're good?

647
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,560
 But he was so annoyed at having to wear an eye patch

648
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,600
 for one eye, that in the other eye, he refused surgery.

649
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,520
 And the cataracts, they meant that he could never

650
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,120
 see blue or purple again.

651
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,280
 Gosh.

652
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,320
 Yeah.

653
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:06,040
 You know, there's a Guinness World record.

654
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,240
 It's the latest that I'd read.

655
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,640
 Possibly it's changed, but for the longest eyesight,

656
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,560
 for the longest human being able to spot something,

657
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,040
 the biggest distance.

658
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:15,760
 But wait a minute.

659
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,920
 I can see stars, which are billions of light years away.

660
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,200
 And it's you, James, who holds the--

661
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,440
 [LAUGHTER]

662
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:28,040
 I'm here to present you with your second award of the evening.

663
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:33,600
 So is she able to read an eye test chart from a long way away?

664
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,360
 Is that the idea?

665
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,760
 So the test that they did on her was to put humans

666
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,480
 very far away, and for her to go, oh, it's Bob.

667
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,000
 And that was it.

668
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,040
 And she could identify someone as far,

669
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,480
 more than 1.6 kilometers away.

670
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,080
 Oh.

671
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,080
 Yeah.

672
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,080
 What?

673
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,000
 Her name was Veronica Cedar.

674
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,840
 And she was tested.

675
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,320
 Because everyone at school was like, oh, she can see--

676
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,680
 how did she know the bus was coming?

677
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,720
 It's miles away.

678
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:01,360
 And she could actually tell-- she could actually say,

679
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,360
 it's about 1.2 miles away.

680
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,360
 She could judge distances as well.

681
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:05,860
 Yeah.

682
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:08,280
 Presumably, they did not just test her with people

683
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,680
 she knew who wore very interestingly shaped clothing.

684
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,840
 Well, because if you wore your special hat--

685
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,000
 Yes, good point.

686
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,520
 Good point.

687
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,080
 If you dress as a star, James would be all over her head.

688
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,480
 [LAUGHTER]

689
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,040
 No, the fascinating thing was not only

690
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,480
 was she able to spot the person, but she could spot.

691
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,920
 She could make differentiation in the colors of clothing

692
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,040
 that they were wearing as well, which

693
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,360
 apparently at that distance is even harder to do,

694
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,000
 because they all kind of blur into one.

695
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,520
 Right.

696
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,480
 That is amazing.

697
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,880
 She'd be a horrible person to try and hide from, wouldn't she?

698
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,920
 Or to run away from--

699
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,000
 Why run away from?

700
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,680
 Well, just because if you're trying to run away,

701
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,840
 she can still see you, even though you think

702
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,240
 you've got a distance between you guys.

703
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,680
 Well, you should just go into a building.

704
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,240
 Yeah, exactly.

705
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,440
 This is only a problem if you're trying to run away

706
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:59,040
 from Veronica Cedar on a feature list desert plane.

707
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,120
 You're very rarely playing hide-and-seek on a feature list

708
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,640
 that doesn't play any.

709
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,920
 I imagine both hide-and-seek.

710
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,320
 It's just about being so fucking far away.

711
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,000
 Guys, you obviously haven't got the advanced level hide-and-seek

712
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,760
 that I've graduated, is you?

713
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,560
 The goby desert Shazinsky Challenge.

714
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:21,480
 I've got a fact about the lenses in the eyes of Nutes.

715
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,160
 Oh, yeah.

716
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,160
 What?

717
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,000
 So Nutes.

718
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,680
 This is a similar word in German, maybe.

719
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,000
 Nutes?

720
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,760
 Like a little lizard?

721
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,320
 Roy? Roy? Roy?

722
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,600
 We're never going to-- it's never going to--

723
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,640
 We all know it with the Nutes.

724
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,840
 The Nutes. The Nutes.

725
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,040
 We think.

726
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,040
 Mike.

727
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,040
 Mike.

728
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,040
 Right.

729
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,120
 Mike the Nute.

730
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,520
 OK.

731
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:49,040
 It does sound like an Irish person called Mike, doesn't it?

732
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,880
 Oh, I told Mike the Nute.

733
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,520
 Sorry, gone.

734
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,560
 No, no.

735
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,320
 Well, Mike the Nute.

736
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,880
 He is very lucky because he can regenerate

737
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,480
 the lenses of his eyes indefinitely.

738
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,000
 Wow.

739
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,080
 So a group of scientists tested this,

740
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,360
 because I think it was known that this could be done.

741
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,840
 So they removed the lenses.

742
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,840
 It doesn't have a cruel ending, the story.

743
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,160
 OK, that's the important thing to say.

744
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,840
 I mean, this bit is arguably very cruel.

745
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:20,080
 But they removed the lenses from a group of Nutes' eyes,

746
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,320
 and the Nutes' grew back perfect lenses.

747
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,880
 So the scientists did it again.

748
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,480
 And they grew them back again.

749
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,920
 Scientists removed them again.

750
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:36,360
 They grew them back 18 times in a row, and perfectly.

751
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,560
 The lenses that were grown back were indistinguishable

752
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,040
 from the lenses of a 14-year-old adult

753
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:45,160
 Nute that had never had a lens removed in the first place.

754
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,520
 That is amazing.

755
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,520
 That's incredible.

756
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,960
 And then on the 19th time, did it screw it up?

757
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,080
 Yeah, it's screw it up.

758
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:51,600
 That was it.

759
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,440
 It's 18 max.

760
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,440
 I think they stopped at 18 probably because their ethics committee

761
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,000
 had started asking questions.

762
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,880
 But actually, because I read a story in the news this year

763
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,720
 about a 67-year-old woman who had 27 contact lenses

764
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,400
 removed from her eyes.

765
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,320
 And I thought that she'd been putting them in

766
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,280
 and then kept forgetting to take them out.

767
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:18,240
 But now, I'm thinking she might be a Nute.

768
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,880
 It's Mike's wife.

769
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:25,000
 We're going to have to move on in a second.

770
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,440
 I've got one last thing.

771
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,160
 I was just looking into eyes, generally.

772
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,760
 And it was very romantic, though.

773
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:39,160
 A number of women in Vienna have issued restraining orders

774
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,360
 now, aren't they?

775
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:40,960
 Yeah.

776
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,200
 My wife is not happy.

777
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,080
 Honey, it's research.

778
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,240
 No, I-- so it's sometimes research.

779
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,400
 Takes you down a rabbit hole and you go to different places.

780
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,440
 And I was looking into eyes and movies

781
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,600
 because we had 3D and how you have eyes.

782
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,360
 But my favorite fact that I discovered

783
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:00,440
 is that there was a movie that was made called "Blade Trinity"

784
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,680
 with Wesley Snipes as "Blade."

785
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,440
 It was a disastrous production.

786
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,520
 And he hated being on it.

787
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,080
 And he refused to do so many things,

788
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:11,160
 called himself "Blade on Set," not "Blade."

789
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:14,880
 But the head to head came between the director and Wesley

790
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,760
 Snipes for one scene where they were filming his face,

791
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,360
 just his face.

792
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:22,480
 And Wesley Snipes refused to open his eyes in the scene.

793
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,560
 And he refused for so long that the director

794
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,640
 went, screw it, we've done, we got it.

795
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:29,480
 And they CGI'd his eyes opening.

796
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,000
 No.

797
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,280
 CGI.

798
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,960
 CGI'd?

799
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,640
 So if you watch it, you can see it online.

800
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,320
 It's amazing.

801
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,880
 These weird cartoon eyes suddenly appear

802
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,880
 because he refused to open them on set.

803
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,160
 That's amazing.

804
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:46,040
 Oh, there's one other movie, "I Fact."

805
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,720
 It just is so relevant.

806
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,600
 So and it's about contact lenses and eye correction.

807
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,160
 The first use of contact lenses

808
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:55,680
 to change an actor's eye color was in a film called "Miracles

809
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:59,960
 for Sale," and they used a blue ceramic lens.

810
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,800
 This is really early to change an actor's eye color,

811
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,360
 I think, from brown to blue.

812
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,760
 The weird thing is, this happened in the film "Miracles

813
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,240
 for Sale," which was released in 1939,

814
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,760
 and is, in fact, a black and white film.

815
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,800
 [LAUGHTER]

816
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,800
 Incredible.

817
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,400
 OK, it is time for fact number three.

818
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,440
 And that is Andy.

819
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,000
 My fact is that some inuits, if they got extremely hungry,

820
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,160
 would have been able to eat their own sleds.

821
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,600
 So someone in the audience said, what?

822
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,360
 Fair enough.

823
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:42,400
 So some inuit sleds were partially made of fish.

824
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:47,200
 This was a thing you could do if you were in--

825
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,120
 frankly, if your normal sled had broken or you'd

826
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,000
 been lost.

827
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,920
 For instance, if you lived so far north,

828
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,960
 there were no trees.

829
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,480
 Exactly.

830
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,160
 And you wouldn't have much driftwood,

831
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,360
 and so you needed something.

832
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,400
 You couldn't make it out of wood.

833
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,920
 So what you would do is you would take three fish,

834
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,400
 this particular kind of fish, the inuit hunter-grate deal.

835
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,960
 They're called Arctic Char.

836
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,840
 You cut them in two lengthways, and you put them in a row.

837
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:15,040
 And then you wrap those up in seal skin with leather strips.

838
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,920
 So it's made of fish and seal now.

839
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,040
 Overnight, bang, they freeze.

840
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,880
 You have an instant runner for a sled.

841
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,400
 Then you need crossbars, and those

842
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,320
 are sometimes made of caribou leg bones or walrus skin.

843
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,320
 Some sources say walrus meat.

844
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,400
 So this is a very edible sled.

845
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,560
 We're putting together.

846
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,080
 You tie it all together with more strips of seal.

847
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,000
 And you've got a sled, basically.

848
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,160
 And the main thing you have to do is stop your dogs

849
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,920
 from eating it.

850
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,600
 That's amazing.

851
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,520
 It's like the extension of one of those necklaces

852
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,560
 you can wear that has sweets around it

853
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,960
 that you can eat if you get hungry.

854
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,080
 They've taken that one step further.

855
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,480
 Well, they had a lot of fish.

856
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,680
 They like fish.

857
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,200
 They liked fish back in the day.

858
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,480
 They like fish a bit less now, since I think in you,

859
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:03,720
 it's largely, I suppose, invaded by Western culture a bit.

860
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,920
 So they're now like fish and McDonald's.

861
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,640
 But they would eat seal a lot, but have a huge respect

862
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,560
 for seals, right?

863
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,880
 So they thought that seals would be offended

864
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,600
 if they stopped eating them.

865
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,400
 And so--

866
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,880
 and they would treat them with huge reverence.

867
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,640
 So as they killed a seal, they

868
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:25,360
 would give it a drink of water to quench its thirst as it died.

869
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,440
 So it'd be like, well, what a nice guy.

870
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,600
 They did that.

871
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,640
 And the UPIC people, actually, who are related culturally

872
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:34,720
 to the Inuits and who are slightly further south,

873
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,520
 they would return a preserved seal bladder to the sea

874
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:42,040
 every year, hoping that the seal bladder would swim back

875
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:45,480
 to its seal friends and say, I was treated really well.

876
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,680
 By the UPIC people, don't worry about them.

877
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,320
 They're good guys.

878
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,560
 And yeah, that would encourage them to go and give themselves

879
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,000
 up to hunters.

880
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,840
 That is amazing.

881
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,280
 It's a complex morality.

882
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,960
 This fish sled, I think, was first described

883
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:05,040
 by an explorer called Peter Freiken.

884
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:09,320
 And he found some people in a town called igloo lick

885
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,800
 who were doing this.

886
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,920
 And the name igloo lick, it's a town.

887
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,600
 It's absolutely in the middle of nowhere.

888
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,600
 No trees is a tiny little island.

889
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:22,080
 The name igloo lick means there is a house here.

890
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:27,560
 But also, it is the home of the world's only Inuit Circus.

891
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,560
 Yeah.

892
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,520
 They're called the Arts Cirque.

893
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:34,800
 But they actually were invited to do a show in Marley

894
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,280
 in Timbuktu.

895
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,840
 And so they've gone from a town where it's usually around

896
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,240
 minus 50 degrees centigrade.

897
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,320
 And they've gone to Marley where it's normally

898
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,120
 plus 40 degrees centigrade.

899
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:45,880
 Oh, God.

900
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,040
 And they turned up.

901
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,480
 And they basically couldn't do it.

902
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:53,360
 And so they're only shows they could do were in midnight.

903
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,840
 And so they would do shows at midnight.

904
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,680
 And the whole rest of the day, they would just sleep.

905
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,920
 Because it was so hot.

906
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,600
 But did they have the same animals, like viruses

907
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,000
 and seals, presumably?

908
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,840
 Well, there is a balloon guy.

909
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:09,000
 But he only uses the bladder removed from a seal.

910
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,160
 It was a non-animal circus.

911
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,000
 It was more like trapeze and juggling and things like that.

912
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,560
 So cool.

913
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:19,720
 The uses of seals by Inuit people are very, very broad.

914
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,680
 Because if you have only a few resources,

915
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,320
 then you have to use the ones you can as well as possible.

916
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,440
 So raw seal liver was a childhood treat food.

917
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,800
 For some Inuit groups, there was chewing gum,

918
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,600
 which was made of seal blubber.

919
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:37,400
 Seal blood soup was a good thing for new mothers.

920
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,360
 And it was seal blubber oil was used

921
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:44,680
 as a body lotion and as a fuel and as a laxative.

922
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,960
 Oh, yeah.

923
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,400
 OK.

924
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,080
 Dry skin, too cold, constipated?

925
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:53,200
 Have we got anything for you?

926
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,160
 You know, you can be proposed to for marriage

927
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:58,680
 by a seal in an igloo.

928
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,320
 You're going to have to explain it further.

929
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,960
 So the singer's seal proposed to his model girlfriend,

930
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,760
 Heidi Klum, in an igloo.

931
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,440
 Is that right?

932
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,240
 Yeah.

933
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,400
 I've seen the Canadian Rockies.

934
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:18,240
 I have never been more disappointed with the fact in my life.

935
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:22,320
 That's the best fact I've ever said in my life.

936
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,320
 I was low.

937
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,320
 Is that right?

938
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,400
 Because there's no way James is going to leave that in the edit.

939
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,000
 So have you enjoyed?

940
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,080
 Here's a really, really interesting thing.

941
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:34,120
 This is quite sciencey and it's due with the Inuit people.

942
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,680
 So the Inuit elders at the moment

943
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:40,280
 think that the Earth's tilt has changed.

944
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,400
 And the reason they think that is because they often

945
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,040
 tell the time by looking at the moon and the stars

946
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,680
 and where the sun comes up.

947
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,800
 And they found that over the last few years

948
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,320
 that the sun is coming up in a different place

949
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,920
 and that the stars are in a different place

950
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,120
 and the moon's in a different place

951
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,840
 when compared to the mountains.

952
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,640
 And the reason is that global warming

953
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,480
 has caused the atmosphere to get warmer.

954
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,080
 And so when you see light coming from space,

955
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,600
 it refracts.

956
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,800
 And so actually where the sun used to you thought it was

957
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,360
 is not there anymore.

958
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,120
 And it's in a completely different place.

959
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:16,680
 And their explanation was that the Earth's tilt had changed.

960
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,200
 Wow.

961
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,680
 And we're just all too scared to tell them

962
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:23,640
 about global warming because they are going to be pissed off.

963
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,680
 Wow, that's very cool.

964
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,480
 They must have such a specific--

965
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,280
 Yeah.

966
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,160
 --because it hasn't changed that much.

967
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:28,840
 A position of the sun.

968
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,400
 I would have noticed.

969
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,480
 So even in Viking times, you would tell--

970
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:36,640
 if you live in, say, Babylonian places,

971
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,400
 you live near the equator.

972
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,040
 And you would tell the time because the sun rises in the east

973
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,400
 and sets in the west.

974
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,080
 But if you live in the north, if you're

975
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,440
 a Viking or something like that,

976
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,840
 or you live in the polar circle, then the sun

977
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,760
 is always rising and setting in different places.

978
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,320
 And so the way that they tell the time

979
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,960
 is they would take specific things on the horizon--

980
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,920
 like, for instance, a mountain or a gate.

981
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,000
 Not a goat's goat.

982
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,200
 There's old Veronica Cedar, 1.6 kilometers away.

983
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,040
 I know that goat.

984
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:11,720
 That was going so well.

985
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:16,720
 Yes, anyway, there would take something on the horizon,

986
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,160
 and they would use that to tell exactly what time of day it was.

987
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,000
 Very cool.

988
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:20,760
 Very cool.

989
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,440
 But not a goat.

990
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,760
 Not a goat.

991
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,400
 Unless you cement it into the ground.

992
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:29,640
 So there was a woman called Jean Briggs,

993
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,600
 who was an anthropologist in the 1960s,

994
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,600
 who lived with the Inuits in Alaska,

995
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:38,360
 and wrote down what they were like and followed them

996
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:42,560
 for many years, and discovered that they never got angry.

997
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,680
 So this was-- and it was extraordinary.

998
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,840
 If anything went wrong, they would stay totally calm.

999
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:50,400
 So there was a fishing line that took days and days to braid,

1000
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,240
 and it broke on first use.

1001
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,560
 And no one flinches.

1002
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:56,600
 They'd just say, we had better make a new one now.

1003
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,760
 But not like a creepy zombie, I can all hear.

1004
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,260
 Wow.

1005
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:03,400
 Did they do it through grit, like is it gritted teeth, or is it?

1006
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,880
 No, gritted teeth, totally calm.

1007
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,240
 And then one day, she was walking home.

1008
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,120
 And she saw a mother and her young son are saying--

1009
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,440
 and the son had a rock in his hand.

1010
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,520
 And the mother was saying, throw that rock at me.

1011
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,120
 Go on, throw that rock at me harder.

1012
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,720
 And the son was throwing rocks at her.

1013
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,080
 And she realized that they act out plays

1014
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:25,240
 where they show children how to express their anger.

1015
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,840
 So and they show children exactly what the consequences

1016
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:28,640
 of their anger are.

1017
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,880
 So in that situation, she was acting out play.

1018
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,560
 The kid was throwing a rock really hard at his mum.

1019
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,600
 And his mum went, ow, that hurt.

1020
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:39,400
 And then the child learns it hurts if I throw a rock at my mum.

1021
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,400
 That wasn't a very good consequence.

1022
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,720
 She's upset now.

1023
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,960
 And this is how they did it.

1024
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,440
 And they act out these plays constantly.

1025
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,520
 And that's how they-- so they would never ever shout

1026
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,560
 at their children, ever.

1027
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:52,120
 They find it bizarre that we would.

1028
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:55,960
 That requires a lot of knowledge of self and others

1029
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:56,920
 for the child.

1030
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:59,560
 Because you don't develop a clear idea

1031
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:03,000
 that other people have feelings too for some years.

1032
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,840
 So a more effective way was--

1033
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,840
 So it was still struggling, right?

1034
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:12,760
 So wouldn't it be more effective to throw a rock at--

1035
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,280
 Yeah.

1036
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,160
 To throw a rock at the child.

1037
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:16,920
 Yes, yeah, yeah.

1038
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,440
 And then, good point.

1039
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,120
 You don't have children, do you, I think?

1040
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,120
 I don't.

1041
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,240
 I thought that was where you were going.

1042
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:26,960
 And I didn't know how to get you out of it any more than you did.

1043
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,800
 Could it be that they were just training themselves

1044
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,880
 for an eventuality where we all end up

1045
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,400
 living on that planet that rains rocks all the time?

1046
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,600
 We're going to have to move on in a second to our final fact.

1047
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,560
 One thing they used to do with these sleds we were talking about

1048
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,760
 is they would tie all the bits together

1049
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,480
 with something called walrus thong.

1050
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,680
 And walrus thong is a really, really thin piece of rope

1051
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,640
 made from walrus skin.

1052
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:54,480
 And according to anthropologist Freelik Rainey,

1053
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,640
 it was the strongest line known before the invention

1054
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,120
 of the steel cable.

1055
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,320
 Wow.

1056
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:00,960
 How amazing is that?

1057
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:01,960
 Yeah.

1058
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:05,840
 They had such incredible technology in the Inuit world.

1059
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:08,680
 They made armor out of walrus teeth.

1060
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,400
 And so if they were attacked by animals,

1061
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,920
 they wouldn't be able to get through these walrus teeth armor.

1062
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:15,360
 Or if you're bastard kid, throw the rock at you one day.

1063
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:18,360
 [LAUGHTER]

1064
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:21,680
 I have another thong fact, actually.

1065
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,920
 But it is the other kind of thong.

1066
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:28,600
 So the Greenland Inuit, they had a G-string clothing,

1067
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,800
 a piece of clothing, which is called a Natsid.

1068
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,920
 And it's made of seal fur.

1069
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:36,400
 And it's pretty, you know, it's pretty sexy.

1070
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,400
 It's strips of seal pelt, but it's very furry.

1071
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,920
 And it's threaded together with whale sinews.

1072
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,120
 And you would wear them under your seal skin trousers.

1073
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:48,640
 But it's not for romantic moments.

1074
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,560
 If you've been looking in someone's eyes for ages and ages,

1075
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,320
 it's actually not for those moments.

1076
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:57,480
 It's to wear, if you had guests or if you were going visiting

1077
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:02,160
 other people, you would just turn up in your G-string.

1078
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:06,040
 And Danish missionaries got quite stressed about this

1079
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:09,080
 when they visited and made contact with the Inuit here.

1080
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:12,320
 And they tried to persuade them to wear longer undergarments.

1081
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,320
 That's amazing.

1082
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,320
 Without success.

1083
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,400
 Yeah.

1084
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,560
 I'd like to think that in the end, the Danish missionaries

1085
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:20,120
 adapted, and they all ended up wearing.

1086
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,000
 Well, there's a really good reason for it.

1087
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,640
 It's because if you sweat, it's very dangerous, actually,

1088
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:26,120
 to sweat.

1089
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:29,840
 So your clothing needs to be able to expel heat and not

1090
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:30,880
 let cold in.

1091
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,880
 Because if you sweat, it will freeze.

1092
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,400
 So the point of the seal fur G-string

1093
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,320
 is that you don't end up with frozen sweat trapped

1094
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:42,160
 between your buttocks.

1095
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:45,440
 Well, I'm sold out.

1096
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,720
 I go one last thing.

1097
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,680
 We were just talking about how armor was made out of teeth.

1098
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,800
 And I was thinking about how the fact that the sleds,

1099
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:52,480
 you could eat a sled.

1100
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,640
 That sounds really badass.

1101
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:55,520
 And I started looking into that territory.

1102
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,520
 Found a guy from Canada called Francis Wharton.

1103
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,480
 And he lived away out in the wilderness.

1104
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,760
 And in the '50s and '60s, they're not sure the exact year,

1105
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,040
 but he shot a deer.

1106
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:08,480
 And he basically shot it because he needed new dentures.

1107
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,560
 His teeth had completely rotted and fallen out.

1108
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,240
 But Robbins go get new dentures.

1109
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,400
 He shot a deer.

1110
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,360
 And he took its teeth out.

1111
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,360
 And he shaved the teeth down.

1112
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:19,240
 And he wore them as dentures.

1113
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:25,920
 And then he ate that deer that he shot with its own teeth.

1114
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,920
 That's such a threat, isn't it?

1115
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,640
 I'm going to eat you with your teeth.

1116
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:31,920
 That's amazing.

1117
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:32,400
 Yeah.

1118
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,080
 So that's the way to scare a deer.

1119
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,560
 It is time for a final fact of the show.

1120
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:43,400
 And that is James.

1121
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:48,160
 OK, my fact this week is that some bottled water in Vienna

1122
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:52,160
 costs 9,000 euros per liter.

1123
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:55,720
 And this audience does not believe me.

1124
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:57,240
 And yet, it is true.

1125
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:57,760
 OK.

1126
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,640
 And I think the reason the audience doesn't believe me

1127
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:03,160
 is because the water in Vienna is famously amazing.

1128
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:03,640
 And so--

1129
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:06,640
 [APPLAUSE]

1130
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,680
 Wow, OK, guys, it's not that good.

1131
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:13,120
 And so why would anyone buy bottled water in Vienna

1132
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,840
 because the tap water is so good?

1133
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,560
 But actually, the reason is that there

1134
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:20,480
 is a thing called Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water.

1135
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,200
 And it's used for calibrating instruments.

1136
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:27,200
 And it has very specific mix of isotopes inside it.

1137
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,680
 So you know if you buy it, it will be exactly the same

1138
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,120
 every single time.

1139
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:34,960
 And you can use it for all sorts of scientific reasons.

1140
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,600
 And it is actually 20 times more expensive

1141
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,480
 than inkjet printing.

1142
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,200
 Wow.

1143
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,920
 The reason it has the word Vienna in it

1144
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,280
 is because it was due to the International Atomic Energy

1145
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:48,200
 Agency, which is based in Vienna.

1146
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:49,840
 And that's why I was called that.

1147
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:53,360
 And you have these things that scientists use all the time.

1148
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:56,440
 They're called Standard Reference Materials.

1149
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:59,320
 And if you're trying to measure anything,

1150
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:00,600
 you really need a control.

1151
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,240
 You need a standard to put them against.

1152
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,120
 And this could be literally anything.

1153
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:08,600
 So for instance, you can buy a jar of peanut butter

1154
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:12,800
 for $761 in America.

1155
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,320
 And the reason you're going to buy that one

1156
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:17,240
 is because it's a very specific type of peanut butter,

1157
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,720
 which is always going to be exactly the same.

1158
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,920
 And if you want to measure how many peanuts are in your peanut

1159
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,120
 butter, you have to measure it against this one.

1160
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:25,760
 Wow.

1161
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:30,920
 You can buy 15 grams of specific turmeric for $420.

1162
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:35,320
 Your grocery bill, James, must be enormous.

1163
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:36,720
 But the lucky thing is, they always

1164
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:41,680
 arrive between 400 octillion years.

1165
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:46,560
 You could buy 40 grams of domestic sludge for $715.

1166
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:50,200
 So what is exactly what it sounds like, Andy?

1167
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:50,720
 What is--

1168
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,480
 It's stuff that's come out of your waste,

1169
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:56,000
 of your toilet, or your bathroom, or whatever.

1170
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,200
 But it's very specific.

1171
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:00,600
 So it has exactly pretty much the average amount

1172
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:03,400
 of everything that a human waste would have.

1173
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:07,480
 Well, it's like ratio number two to number one, basically.

1174
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:08,160
 Yeah, kind of.

1175
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,200
 It's got exactly the right number of sweet con kernels.

1176
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,200
 Yeah.

1177
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,200
 In the--

1178
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,520
 [LAUGHTER]

1179
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:21,880
 You can buy freeze-dried typical diet for $912.

1180
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:25,680
 And this is basically get the average American diet

1181
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,080
 of what Americans eat in a week.

1182
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:29,880
 And they squish it all down.

1183
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:30,880
 And they freeze-dry it.

1184
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,520
 And you're getting a little package.

1185
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:36,160
 And you might want to use it to measure that against someone

1186
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,920
 else's diet, for instance.

1187
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:38,440
 Right, yeah.

1188
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:40,640
 And it's mostly for instruments and things like that.

1189
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,160
 I was looking for other expensive waters.

1190
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,920
 OK, expensive kinds of water.

1191
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:49,400
 So there's a Hawaiian brand called Kona Negari.

1192
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:53,400
 And it comes from 2,000 feet under the ocean.

1193
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:53,920
 Wow.

1194
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:54,520
 Under the ocean?

1195
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:55,320
 Under the ocean.

1196
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:58,520
 All right, under 2,000 feet of ocean.

1197
00:50:58,520 --> 00:50:59,840
 It's 2,000 feet deep.

1198
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:01,320
 In the ocean.

1199
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:04,040
 Ooh, boy, I've really got this one.

1200
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,240
 It's from 2,000 feet down.

1201
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:08,880
 It's a specific sort of river flowing within the ocean, I say.

1202
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,800
 So it's not salty.

1203
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,360
 I am not sure whether or not it's salty.

1204
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,960
 It may be treated once it's brought up.

1205
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:14,160
 OK.

1206
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:17,320
 But it was discovered a while ago, because scientists

1207
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:20,720
 wanted to use very, very cold water from the bottom.

1208
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:23,400
 And use the temperature difference with surface water.

1209
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:23,920
 I know.

1210
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,560
 They thought they could generate electricity from this

1211
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:26,600
 and power homes.

1212
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,080
 They couldn't generate enough of that.

1213
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:30,880
 But they had a source of this extra deep water now.

1214
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:34,120
 So they started just selling it as magic bottled water.

1215
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:38,280
 And it's supposedly free from all pollution and contamination.

1216
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:40,400
 It's got lots of seaweed minerals in it.

1217
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,600
 It costs $400 for 750 mils.

1218
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,600
 It's expensive.

1219
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,720
 They sell it to athletes on the promise

1220
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:51,200
 that it helps you rehydrate twice as fast after exercise.

1221
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,360
 OK, it does it.

1222
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:57,200
 Well, the main study, I think, that it's

1223
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,440
 based on, is a study which shows that

1224
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:04,320
 gerbils do better on treadmills when fed this water.

1225
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:07,840
 And the hamsters on surfbots?

1226
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:10,560
 So some scientists are a bit skeptical,

1227
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,840
 because it appears that the gerbils run better

1228
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,560
 and rehydrate faster.

1229
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:15,560
 OK.

1230
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:17,760
 But it sounds like nonsense, doesn't it?

1231
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,040
 But maybe it's true.

1232
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:23,720
 Because if you eat super pure water or if you drink it,

1233
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:26,880
 like ultra pure water, then that really is bad.

1234
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,960
 So there are four types of water classification,

1235
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:29,720
 I think, in science.

1236
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:31,640
 And we drink the really gross one, which

1237
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:33,680
 is the only one that we can actually stomach, which

1238
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,800
 is, I think, is called feeder water.

1239
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:39,040
 And then the top one is ultra pure water.

1240
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:42,320
 And that's when it's gone through a series of processes,

1241
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:45,800
 which basically means it has absolutely nothing in it.

1242
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:49,440
 No minerals, nothing except hydrogen and oxygen.

1243
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,320
 And if you drank ultra pure water,

1244
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:54,560
 then it would start leaching all of the minerals out

1245
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:56,320
 of your body and dissolve everything.

1246
00:52:56,320 --> 00:53:01,040
 Because water is the universal solvent you learn at school.

1247
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:03,440
 And so it literally dissolves everything.

1248
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,680
 And so if that goes through your system,

1249
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:09,640
 you're just a big, well, you're a big solution.

1250
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:11,640
 Hi.

1251
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:14,760
 I found a really expensive bottle of water,

1252
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:18,440
 which is the water that goes up to the International Space

1253
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:21,960
 Station, which is approximately $10,000

1254
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,760
 American per bottle of water.

1255
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:27,760
 When you have to consider the fuel costs

1256
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,920
 to get it to space, yeah.

1257
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,600
 But that's roughly-- they broke it down.

1258
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:32,560
 Someone did a calculation.

1259
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:33,560
 That's roughly what it costs.

1260
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:35,800
 And which is why it's such a thing

1261
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,640
 where they're trying to work out how you can turn water

1262
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,520
 or urine and so on, that's being water

1263
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,400
 being drunk, and then the urine coming out back into water

1264
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,520
 and create that cycle.

1265
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:47,000
 So they use everything on the ISS that

1266
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,480
 emits any kind of moisture feeding it back

1267
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,040
 into trying to turn it into water.

1268
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,320
 Do they drink their own urine on the ISS?

1269
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:53,820
 They do.

1270
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:55,360
 They drink rat urine as well.

1271
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:58,520
 There's rats in the ISS that they recently

1272
00:53:58,520 --> 00:53:59,960
 converted some of the urine.

1273
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:03,600
 So I think it's 74 rats having a P that is equivalent

1274
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:08,480
 to one human P. So they need to really be going for it.

1275
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,720
 But yeah, that's a problem up there.

1276
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,640
 So but that's how much it costs to get up there.

1277
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:13,480
 That's very expensive.

1278
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:16,960
 Listen, there's a type of water you can buy in Japan,

1279
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:21,760
 which is very specifically intended to be used in an emergency.

1280
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,160
 So obviously they have a lot of earthquakes and things

1281
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,680
 and tsunamis and things in Japan

1282
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,120
 compared to the rest of the world.

1283
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:30,800
 And so they sell this specific water for an emergency.

1284
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,280
 And it's called Zaiho's Emergency Supply of Water.

1285
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:36,600
 And it says on the bottle that it's safe to drink

1286
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:39,360
 even after five years.

1287
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,440
 And it has one more slogan, which is,

1288
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:45,880
 this is water from 30,000 years ago.

1289
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:49,840
 Wow, so they've taken it out 30,000-- after 30,000 years,

1290
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:53,160
 just before it goes back.

1291
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:54,480
 That's the expiry date of water.

1292
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,720
 Amazing.

1293
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:57,880
 We're going to have to wrap up soon.

1294
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:00,400
 I've got a thing on a weird measurement.

1295
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:03,560
 So this was about scientific.

1296
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:04,760
 What would the word be?

1297
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:05,760
 Like standard?

1298
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:06,520
 Yes, standard.

1299
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:07,360
 Exactly.

1300
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:10,640
 I found a standard which is not used in everyday life,

1301
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:14,120
 but it certainly is used in near Boston.

1302
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:16,000
 There was a guy called Oliver R. Smoot.

1303
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,880
 And he was the chairman of the American National Standards

1304
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,800
 Institute, and the president of the international organization

1305
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:22,880
 for standardization.

1306
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,000
 This was his whole world.

1307
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,360
 And there's a unit of measurement that

1308
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:27,800
 is named after him called the Smoot.

1309
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:33,800
 And the Smoot is the length of him, which is 5 feet 7 inches.

1310
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:38,160
 And it's to measure a specific bridge, the Harvard bridge.

1311
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:43,120
 So we know that it is 364.4 Smoots.

1312
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:45,320
 And that is how they know--

1313
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:48,320
 and when you go across this bridge, it has how many Smoots.

1314
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:49,840
 You've walked across.

1315
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:52,040
 And in order to do it, they laid him down.

1316
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,040
 Oh, yeah, they did.

1317
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:53,640
 Yeah, they did.

1318
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:54,600
 So he laid down.

1319
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:55,080
 He got up.

1320
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:55,920
 He laid down.

1321
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:56,440
 He laid down.

1322
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:57,200
 Then he got tired.

1323
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,880
 So they started picking him up and moving him

1324
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,560
 to where the edge of his head is.

1325
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,880
 But the police over there use Smoots.

1326
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,680
 When an accident happens on the bridge,

1327
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:07,760
 they'll say it's 160 Smoots in on the bridge.

1328
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,080
 So it's an official standard.

1329
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:09,400
 You know what?

1330
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,080
 They should have done.

1331
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:13,040
 They should have a tape measure, measured him once.

1332
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:16,560
 And then he got a gone home for the rest of the day.

1333
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:19,840
 More on.

1334
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:21,120
 I got one more measurement.

1335
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:21,720
 Yeah.

1336
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:25,640
 So you can measure what is the most livable city on the planet.

1337
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:33,400
 And that is the city of rats.

1338
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,760
 No, of course, of course.

1339
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,520
 Well, I've lost the entire audience.

1340
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:41,280
 No, apart from one man in the front row.

1341
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,440
 No, of course, Vienna has the world record,

1342
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:47,640
 the Guinness World Record, as the most livable city on the planet.

1343
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:51,640
 And the way that they measure it is there's loads of different subjects.

1344
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:54,440
 And each one is out of 100%.

1345
00:56:54,440 --> 00:57:00,400
 And Vienna got 100% in every single category, apart from culture.

1346
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,400
 [LAUGHTER]

1347
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:03,400
 OK.

1348
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:05,960
 [APPLAUSE]

1349
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:08,440
 Now, I've been walking around.

1350
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:12,000
 Absolute desert out there.

1351
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,720
 To be fair, they got like 95% in culture and 96%.

1352
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:19,680
 But I thought I would look into some culture in Vienna

1353
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:22,200
 in the Guinness World Records website.

1354
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,480
 And I found the only other record I could find

1355
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:27,920
 is that Vienna holds a world record for the world's longest twerk.

1356
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,960
 [LAUGHTER]

1357
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:34,440
 And that was two hours and one minute.

1358
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:35,440
 Wow.

1359
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:36,440
 That's the bum dance.

1360
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:38,040
 That's the wax where you're wobbling your bum.

1361
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:40,480
 And I like to think that Elena Sterlini--

1362
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,520
 I like to think she was aiming for two hours.

1363
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:44,760
 And it took an extra minute for it to stop wobbling.

1364
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:48,400
 [LAUGHTER]

1365
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:49,240
 OK, that's it.

1366
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:50,080
 Let's wrap up.

1367
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,320
 OK, that is it.

1368
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,600
 That is all of our facts.

1369
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,320
