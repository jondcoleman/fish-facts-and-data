00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 Hi everybody, just before we start this week's show, we have a bit of special news.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.680
 If you look at the episode number, we have done 300 podcasts.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.880
 It is quite astounding, isn't it? Who would have thought it when we put that first episode out?

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.680
 And we accidentally said it was a weekly episode.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.800
 The 300 weeks down the line, we would still be doing it.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.000
 Thank you so much for continuing to listen if you have done.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.520
 If you start listening some time ago, you probably won't hear this bit, so don't worry about it.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.680
 Another really exciting thing about the 300th episode, is it was recorded live in Vienna,

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.600
 of all places, because we got given an award.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.120
 Yes, this is the Heinz Oberhume Award for Scientific Communication.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.800
 Heinz Oberhume was a physicist, he was a great Austrian scientist communicator,

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.920
 and you know, just scientist, as well as anything else, and comedian.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.080
 He very sadly died several years ago, but his colleagues have set up this award in his name,

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.920
 and we were honoured. We were so honoured to receive it.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.440
 I really hope you enjoy the show, because we had a great time making it as well.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.920
 We had a right good laugh on this episode.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.080
 Are we going to say by the book this week?

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.320
 Do you mean, are we going to say, this is your last chance to buy the book of the year 2019,

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.680
 an incredible book full of the most interesting stuff that's happened across the entire planet this year?

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.880
 I wasn't going to say that, no.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.080
 Yeah, I don't think we should say that.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.200
 No, no, and I probably wouldn't explain the things that are in the book.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.120
 Oh, what like the lawnmower records and the British government hunting down a single B

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.120
 and the women's log carp and all the amazing stuff?

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.720
 No, absolutely, we won't mention that at all.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.120
 Great.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.440
 Probably won't mention where you can buy the book.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.440
 Uh, just the bookshop, isn't it, and online?

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.480
 And we've already not mentioned the name of the book,

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.000
 but should we not mention it one more time?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.280
 Oh, yeah, let's not mention that it is called the book of the year 2019.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.960
 Okay, but let's definitely mention that this is our 300th episode.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.800
 Okay, I'm on with the podcast.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.320
 And Merry Christmas!

00:01:48.320 --> 00:02:06.800
 [BELL RINGING]

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.920
 Welcome to a very special 300th episode of no such thing as a fish,

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.600
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from the Heinz Oberhume award ceremony

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.040
 in Vienna, Austria!

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:24.080
 [APPLAUSE]

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.480
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.200
 I am sitting here with Anitazinski James Hark in Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.360
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.800
 from the last seven days.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.400
 And in no particular order, here we go.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.760
 Starting with my fact, my fact this week is that the last TV show

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.200
 that the award-winning eminent physicist Heinz Oberhume made before he passed away

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.320
 was called The Universe is a shithole.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.080
 [LAUGHTER]

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.200
 The whole universe?

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.600
 Uh--

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.680
 The whole universe is a shithole,

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.720
 according to a man who studied it his entire life.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.080
 [LAUGHTER]

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.720
 This is-- I suppose some people in the audience will be aware of this show.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.720
 It was also transformed into a book.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.800
 This is the actual book here.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.160
 "Dus universeum is thine shicek again?"

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.480
 From the audience reaction, I'm not sure you quite caught that.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.480
 [LAUGHTER]

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.840
 This was given to me by Heinz's wife, Doris.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.400
 Thank you so much for this book.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.000
 And yeah, so the reason we're mentioning this fact tonight is because

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.040
 we are actually the recipients of the award this year.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.720
 We are the 2019 Oberhume recipients.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.240
 It's very exciting for us.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.560
 But he'd lost his faith in the universe by the end.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.520
 Apparently.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.320
 Why did he think it was such a shithole?

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.760
 OK, he was an amazing physicist.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.120
 He was an astrophysicist.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.320
 He was a nuclear physicist.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.280
 This is a guy who had a whole career behind him

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.000
 of sort of doing proper amazing science.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.400
 But he also had a fantastic sense of humor.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.120
 And in the sort of later half of his career,

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.280
 he met a group who had given us this award tonight,

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.640
 the science busters who were a big Austrian collective

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.800
 of comedy geeks like us.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.440
 And the whole thing was they would present ideas

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.600
 that were funny as well as being really interesting.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.520
 And this idea was to do with the fact that the universe,

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.400
 it's such an inhospitable place.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.960
 Everywhere you go in it is horrible.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.320
 There's only a tiny little bit of it that is quite nice.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.440
 Earth being one, the rest of it, shithole.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.080
 Yeah, if you got dropped anywhere in the universe,

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.600
 the chances are you would die almost immediately, right?

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.480
 So you're probably not going to end up on a planet.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.160
 You might be in the middle of space.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.160
 You might be in the middle of a star, in which case,

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.960
 you're almost certainly going to die.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.600
 Almost, almost certainly.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.000
 You are confident sometimes about your own chances.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.600
 People from the north of England are very confident.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.400
 No, because Carl Sagan, the famous Carl Sagan,

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.520
 the scientist, he wrote that space is so empty

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.720
 that if you were randomly inserted into the universe,

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.600
 your chance of being on or near a planet is 10 to the power of 33,

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.320
 or one against that, which is 10 followed by 32 zeros.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.280
 And to put that into perspective, if you were to take every bacteria on Earth

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.160
 and put it in a random place in the universe,

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.880
 and you did it every single day for a year,

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.840
 only one of them would end up on a planet.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.960
 Whoa! And that's even on a planet, not even on Earth.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.440
 No, it's very unlikely to be Earth.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.440
 I mean, it's so annoying for the bacteria,

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.400
 because they're on Earth to start with.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.400
 What kind of a weird prank was this?

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.400
 It was a terrible package holiday company for bacteria only.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.840
 And it's not just planets, is it?

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.600
 It's anything as well.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.760
 So the chances are you would have nothing around you.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.680
 The universe is almost entirely made up of what are called voids,

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.080
 which is just a fancy word for nothing.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.560
 And so I didn't really realise this,

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.840
 but if you really zoom out on the universe, which is hard to do,

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.080
 then it basically looks like a cobweb.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.920
 It's connected by threads of galaxies, where all the stuff is.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.920
 So the stars, the planets, the moons, the nebulae,

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.080
 and the rest of it is literally nothing.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.280
 The occasional blob of helium, maybe,

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.360
 if you're really lucky on an exciting day.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.400
 So I was looking at ways of improving the universe,

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.160
 and some people have done some calculations on what would happen.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.160
 So if you filled the whole universe with breathable air,

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.600
 you would think this is a good move.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.600
 It would collapse within 24 hours.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.040
 Oh, nightmare.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.080
 Nightmare, yeah.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.080
 Also, let's just shrink it down.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.800
 If you filled up the solar system with air,

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.240
 what we think would happen is that because there would be air

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.160
 in the 93 million miles between Earth and the Sun,

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.920
 the Sun would be loud enough,

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.400
 because there are all these air molecules to pass on the Sun.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.680
 It would be loud enough to cause you physical injury.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.600
 It would be like having a train horn one metre from your head,

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.960
 all the time, all the time, right?

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.120
 But you wouldn't be able to see it,

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.640
 because the air would be so thick for 93 million miles

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:14.400
 that you wouldn't see what was making the noise, right?

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.840
 But does it matter if you can see it?

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:16.880
 What are you going to turn that?

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.800
 What are you, what are you...

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.280
 I think it is quite important that the light from the Sun

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.040
 reaches our planet.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.680
 I'm really happy about that, yeah.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.080
 The kind of, like, that defeats the whole object of the Sun, right?

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.120
 We don't want it for its night.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.400
 But it would still be very hot.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.280
 It would be very, very hot and loud and dark.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.320
 And dark, yeah.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.080
 It's like being in a nightclub forever.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.920
 So we've got it good.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:40.720
 We've got it good.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.720
 We've got it good because, like Andy was saying,

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.560
 if you ended up on a planet,

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.920
 the likelihood is it won't be as nice a planet as Earth.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.760
 So, for instance, there is a planet called Corot 7b,

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.440
 where it's always raining,

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.120
 but it's always raining rocks.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.120
 And the temperature is around 2,800 Kelvin,

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:04.000
 which is almost 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.240
 But the one good thing about it

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.240
 is it's so close to its star

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.440
 that the year lasts only 20 hours.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.000
 And so that means it's your birthday every day.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.160
 Oh, that's cool.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.240
 But it's also New Year's Day every day,

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.080
 and you're so hungover every day

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.760
 from New Year's Eve the night before.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:25.920
 I found a planet that would be horrible to land on as well

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.440
 if you got there by chance.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.920
 It's called HD189773B.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.440
 Very catchy name.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:36.480
 It's 63 light years away from us.

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.640
 And one of the main issues with it

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.960
 is that it's raining a lot,

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:44.080
 but the rain doesn't go vertically down.

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.920
 It goes horizontally across the planet.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:46.640
 It's not so bad.

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.640
 We get that in England sometimes.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:49.680
 We do get that.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.080
 The problem is that the surface temperatures

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.240
 is such that the particles condensed to form glass.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.880
 So it rains, shards of glass,

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.640
 at 4,000 miles an hour,

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.240
 constantly around the planet.

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.240
 Be birthed out, to out.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.560
 Let's go back to rock planet.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.880
 I was looking at other things that could happen.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.280
 There'd be a bit catastrophic in the universe.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.360
 And do you know what would happen

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.800
 if the moon turned into a black hole

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.520
 with the exact mass of the moon?

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:20.880
 OK, I'm going to say bad.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.920
 Just bad things would happen.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.480
 That's fair, it's a fair point.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.560
 So black holes are usually quite big.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.200
 Remnants of massive, massive stars

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.080
 that have had this huge exotic death

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.600
 and then collapse it on themselves.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.440
 So that's a black hole usually.

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:40.800
 But then they've got this enormous mass.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.360
 And so if there's a black hole with the same mass

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.400
 as a moon, they've got this enormous density story.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:49.440
 That would be extremely, extremely small.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.360
 But it would pull everything that came quite near it towards it.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.360
 But other than that, nothing would happen.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.640
 So round and round road did this.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:57.520
 The moon would disappear.

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:58.680
 We wouldn't see the moon.

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:02.400
 Because it's got the same mass as the moon had.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:03.440
 It's just a little black hole.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.840
 The only thing that would happen is there'd be a tiny little black hole.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.160
 And if a little bit of dust was drifting past it,

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.600
 it would get sucked in.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.520
 OK, the world line or something.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:14.320
 The world would be less romantic without the moon.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.120
 We would be less romantic, yes.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:19.840
 And we do get a bit of heating from the moon, so that would go.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:23.280
 And so that would put off global warming by about two weeks.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.080
 Oh, right.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:29.200
 So this is really a last plan to deal with global warming.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.120
 The emergency.

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:34.320
 Imagine the extinction rebellion if this was their plan

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.160
 that they revealed after all these protests.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.760
 Turn that moon into a black hole.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:42.520
 Two more weeks.

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:45.320
 One bad thing that could happen in the universe

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:49.800
 is the entire universe could die due to a massive bubble.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.800
 OK, this is a thing that astronomers have looked into

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:56.320
 is called death by bubble, just what it says on the tin.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:56.840
 Yeah.

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.360
 And the idea is quite complicated.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:02.600
 But the idea is that the universe is at a certain energy level.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.160
 And that is not the lowest energy level it could possibly

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:05.640
 be in.

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:08.960
 And due to quantum physics, it might go down one level.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.480
 And then there would be a massive bubble.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.200
 And it would just eat up everything in the universe.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:17.520
 And there was a new paper published in the journal Physical Review D.

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:21.000
 And they said they worked out when this is going to happen.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.620
 So the universe may be killed by a death bubble somewhere

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:30.040
 between 10 octodacillian years, which is a one with 58 zeros

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:35.400
 after it, and 10 Quinn Quadrat-Gin-Tillian years, which

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:39.440
 is one with 139 zeros after it.

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:42.480
 And according to the lead author, that is a very, very,

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:50.520
 very, very, very, very, very, very, long time.

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.360
 So is that just the range of when it's going to happen?

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.360
 Yeah.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.040
 It's like a delivery slot from a supermarket.

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:03.200
 So the thing we're talking about--

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.800
 this is Heinz Oberhommer's sort of big work, wasn't it,

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.440
 when he was sort of in his proper science stage?

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.440
 Yeah, so a lot of his works were more

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.720
 about the fine tuning of the universe.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:17.200
 So for instance, the fact that you have certain particles

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.880
 in stars, and if the forces between them

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:23.800
 was changed, even by something like 0.4%,

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.240
 complete life would be completely impossible.

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:29.480
 The stars would-- which currently make carbon and oxygen,

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.920
 they'd either make just carbon or just oxygen.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.800
 So we wouldn't be able to have any life whatsoever.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:37.160
 And it's all about the unlikely hood of life

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.680
 and the unlikely hood of all this.

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:39.680
 Yeah.

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.000
 But then there is also a likelihood of life

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.680
 given the size of the universe, right?

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.400
 According to a lot of scientists.

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:48.400
 But then the bad news about that is, if we ever bump into it,

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.160
 it'll probably want to kill us.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.520
 So it seems like Stephen Hawking's final warning

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:57.040
 before he died was that, if we meet aliens,

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.640
 they're going to want to destroy us all,

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.440
 because the chances are, if an alien gets to us,

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.480
 they're a nomadic alien.

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.400
 They're looking for land, otherwise, why have they left?

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.160
 And if they're looking for land, they're going to wipe us off

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:07.680
 their land.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.760
 It's basically, we've set an example constantly

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:13.120
 throughout history by going to different countries,

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.000
 and then conquering those.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.120
 They're going to do the same to us.

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:20.480
 We need to be advertising to the aliens that it's all a shithole.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.000
 And then they want to come here.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.920
 Exactly.

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.680
 Heinz's master plan.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.040
 Could I tell you quickly, my favorite fact about Heinz?

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:29.880
 Yes, please.

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:34.440
 He, Oberhuma, was a word when he was doing speeches in English

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.200
 that he would say to the audience.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.120
 This might be a word that you find hard to pronounce.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.840
 So why didn't you call me by my other name, which

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.320
 is the translation of that.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:47.160
 I go by Chief Lobster.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:47.960
 Wow.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.800
 Chief Lobster.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:53.800
 Huma Lobster and Oberhuma being a sort of chief character.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:58.440
 So yeah, so he wanted to be known as Chief Lobster.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.920
 And apparently, he used to do gigs like the gig we're doing

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.400
 right now, in front of an audience.

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.960
 And he always used to get really hungry.

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:05.880
 And after getting really hungry after a gig,

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:09.160
 he'd go and find a sausage stand, which was out after the gig.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:10.280
 And one night, it was too late.

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:12.160
 And the sausage stand was shut.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:14.600
 And he had no choice but to go to a Burger King.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.080
 And he was like, I don't want to go to a Burger King.

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:20.200
 Is this when he realized the universe is a shit hole?

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.280
 No, apparently, he went into this Burger King.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:25.480
 And suddenly, because in Austria, he's such a famous name.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.440
 But kids love him.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.000
 He's such a great communicator.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.600
 Everyone in the Burger King queue was like,

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:31.320
 hi, oh my god, it's hi, it's all over.

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:32.680
 Oh my god, this is amazing.

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:37.760
 So from then on, after every gig, he found the local Burger King.

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:41.680
 And made sure that he was recognized by everyone at side.

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.680
 And I think my favorite thing from this award

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.040
 is that we have been given.

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:48.600
 The actual award itself is from a farm that his family runs,

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.200
 which is alpacas.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:53.200
 And these alpacas, obviously, have poos.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:57.600
 And our trophy tonight is a collection of their poo.

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:01.040
 That is the award, which is unbelievable.

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.240
 [LAUGHTER]

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:05.560
 And we saw it being made.

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.640
 We saw our trophies being made.

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:12.920
 Or while we saw an alpaca having a poo, who knows?

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:15.560
 In fact, I think we helped next year's trophy be made.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:19.200
 Because we were invited to see these alpacas and meet them.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.000
 And they're amazing.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.120
 And we fed them.

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.800
 So actually, next year's winner hopefully

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:27.880
 will thank us for contributing to the making of their trophy.

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:30.160
 Because that's only going to come out the other end.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.000
 You'd assume.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:31.920
 Amazing creatures, though.

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.560
 I've never seen an alpaca before.

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:35.120
 They're very cool.

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:40.800
 I was reading a little about their habits and their lifestyle.

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.880
 And one thing they do.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:47.520
 So there's a way you can tell if a female alpaca is pregnant.

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:50.040
 And there are some scientific ways you can tell, obviously,

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.440
 with an ultrasound.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.560
 But you can also tell with a behavioral test.

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:58.160
 And all you have to do is introduce a male alpaca

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.080
 into the same space.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.120
 And when the male approaches the female,

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:09.080
 if the female is pregnant, she will spit in his face.

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:12.120
 That is how you know that the female is pregnant.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:14.080
 And they can do it consistently.

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.520
 They can do it with accuracy.

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:19.320
 They get it exactly right every time.

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:21.200
 But then they get sour mouth, right?

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.720
 This is an alpaca piece of terminology.

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:26.680
 Because their spit tastes very sour and disgusting.

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.320
 But they do need to spit sometimes.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.960
 And so then they get this loose, floppy lower lip.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.520
 So you know when you see them sort of exposing their lower teeth,

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:34.800
 they look a bit gormless.

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.880
 That's because the taste in their mouth is so foul.

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:39.920
 It's too bitter for them.

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:43.760
 But that will teach them not to spit in the first place, really.

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:48.080
 Another bit of alpaca terminology is the ogle.

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:51.600
 And this is a sound that alpacas make when they're ready to mate.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.920
 And it's really-- you've got to listen to it on the internet.

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.600
 It's absolutely amazing.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:59.360
 It's been described as like a rusty jazz trumpeter

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:04.280
 attempting to play a solo inside a swimming pool.

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:05.120
 Awesome.

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:07.160
 James, I don't have a very good imagination.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:10.160
 I just wonder, as you've heard this sound,

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:15.280
 could you just give us something close to it?

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:17.080
 Go on, right?

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:18.280
 Go on.

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:25.840
 OK, if there's any alpacas in the audience,

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:28.520
 you're about to get very excited.

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:34.280
 And then you go, is something like-- that's really good.

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:37.080
 You very impressive.

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:37.760
 That's fantastic.

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:44.840
 I think my favorite terminal-- so how is your career going, James?

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:49.560
 Well, I was on stage in VMA doing an impression of a horny alpaca.

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:56.320
 My favorite terminology, we were just talking terminology,

00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:00.160
 is that when an alpaca gives birth, that's called unpacking.

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:05.440
 I hope that's true.

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:07.000
 What might that sound like?

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.360
 Yeah, they're incredible.

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.200
 Am I right in saying that they can kind of--

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.200
 the females can ovulate on command?

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.560
 I think they have to be stimulated by a male.

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:24.120
 So yeah, when they're contacted by the male member--

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:27.560
 but it can't be that you go up to a female alpaca and just say,

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:29.560
 ovulate, and she just does it.

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:30.760
 When Guardian, ovulate?

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:32.840
 Yeah, I can't.

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:34.960
 And that was actually way over whom his family kicked us off

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:38.280
 the farm yesterday.

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:41.560
 Yeah, sorry to the family for that.

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:44.760
 There is one alpaca in the world which can surf.

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:45.760
 Cool.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:48.400
 Are you talking about surfing on water or on the internet?

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.360
 On water.

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.040
 On water.

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:54.320
 There is a Peruvian surfer, Domingo Pianese,

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:58.560
 and he has taken his alpaca to the Pacific Ocean.

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.080
 And he put it in a flotation vest.

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.280
 It's called Pisco.

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:05.080
 And it's not great at surfing.

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:10.240
 But it is able to kneel on the board for a little while.

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.800
 Well, I think--

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:13.560
 yeah, Pianese said about it.

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:14.440
 He was asked about it.

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:18.120
 He said, I've surfed with a dog, a parrot, a hamster,

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:19.360
 and a cat.

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:21.080
 But I was at a competition in Australia,

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:23.680
 and I saw people surfing with kangaroos and koalas.

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:25.360
 So I thought it would be interesting to surf

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.560
 with an animal that represents Peru.

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:28.240
 Cool.

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:30.080
 Yeah.

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:31.640
 Poor alpaca.

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:32.640
 Yeah.

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:35.680
 We're going to have to move on to our next fact in a second.

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:37.640
 I was just reading a little bit about--

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.600
 because they're Peruvian and they're related to llamas,

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:43.160
 they're camelids, closely related to their larger cousin.

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:47.120
 And the Imerra people of Bolivia and Peru

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:49.040
 have interacted very closely with alpacas

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:50.360
 and al-Anlamas for a while.

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:52.280
 And I stumbled upon a book in this research

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:54.520
 describing how they would use them.

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:57.560
 And this book said that alpaca--

00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:59.680
 the alpaca actually had a very often

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.760
 had a disease that was very similar to syphilis

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:04.800
 in symptoms, which I thought was weird.

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.960
 And then it said, whether this was communicated

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:09.960
 from alpaca to man or vice versa is an open one.

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:12.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:13.840
 What?

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:15.840
 And then I checked, and it was written in 1870,

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.120
 and I think they had different ideas.

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:20.360
 But the other thing in this book also

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:22.720
 said, apparently, llamas, if offended,

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:25.320
 will stomp their foot with rage like a woman.

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:28.800
 [LAUGHTER]

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:32.000
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.480
 OK, it is time for fact number two.

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:36.760
 And that is Chazinsky.

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:40.040
 My fact this week is that early laser eye surgery

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:43.760
 was performed in a trailer next to a trash compactor

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:46.000
 that whenever it was switched on would

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.600
 vibrate the trailer as the doctors were trying to operate.

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:52.040
 Well, I don't know if you're familiar

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:54.400
 with how laser eye surgery works, but it's

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:58.200
 quite a particular process that requires a steady hand

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:01.120
 and a lack of serious vibrations of the room that you're

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:02.280
 standing in.

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:05.680
 I think anything that has a laser and an eye involved,

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:07.560
 probably you don't want it to be vibrating.

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:09.280
 Yeah, was that wobbling?

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:11.080
 I don't worry about it.

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:13.760
 So this is in 1988, and this was straight

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:18.880
 after the first ever successful laser eye surgery on a human.

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:23.000
 A lab was created in Louisiana State University School of Medicine.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.360
 But they were scared about sort of radiation

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.520
 from the laser going into the main building,

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:30.200
 so they made them have it in this caravan, basically.

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.960
 Next to this massive vibrating machine,

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:36.160
 and a rubbish compactor is just a huge machine

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:38.920
 which crushes down shed loads of rubbish.

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:42.040
 As it would turn on every 10 minutes, vibrate the trailer.

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:44.160
 And the doctor doing the surgery got really annoyed

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:47.040
 and said, this is screwing up my surgery.

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.640
 And the company, the trash company,

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.440
 refused to close the compactor.

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:52.480
 And so the doctor, Marguerite McDonald,

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:56.440
 did a study to prove that it was damaging the medical outcomes

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:57.920
 these vibrations.

00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:58.880
 That's--

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:00.640
 What was the study?

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:01.640
 Well, it--

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:03.360
 She didn't operate on 100 people,

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.600
 and then ruined 10 operations.

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.720
 You really want to be part of the control group.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:11.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.160
 She used the evidence from the people

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:15.640
 who'd been in the vibrating room and saw,

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.680
 if their eyes had accidentally been gouged out

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:19.480
 in the process or anything.

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:22.160
 And to her astonishment, she found out

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:24.360
 that the people who'd been operated on when the room was

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.720
 vibrating had actually done better.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.800
 The surgery had been more successful

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.320
 than when it wasn't vibrating.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:31.840
 What?

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:35.360
 And this was a crucial part of laser eye surgery science.

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:38.400
 They realized that basically when the laser is sort of scraping

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.440
 the top of your cornea off, then it had

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.360
 to go up and down to make the incision.

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:46.400
 And it was going up and down about 40 times a minute.

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:49.120
 And that was actually turned out it was a bit too jerky.

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:50.920
 But when you added in the vibrations

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:53.120
 of the big rubbish dump next door,

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:55.480
 it sort of smoothed it out a bit.

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.240
 Oh, I can't believe that.

00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:59.840
 Because these days, when you have laser eye surgery,

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:04.160
 they're not doing it when there's a earthquake going on.

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:07.800
 So what they did was they sped up the laser vibrations.

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.400
 So they said, well, obviously, it's working.

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:12.760
 And we can't guarantee we'll always have this rubbish thing here.

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.160
 So they made the laser go up and down a bit faster.

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.160
 That's extraordinary.

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.040
 Is there a thing, do we know, whereby

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:20.600
 if it was a bit faster, the compactor a bit slow?

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:24.320
 Was it the Goldilocks kind of amount of vibration?

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:27.800
 Oh, I don't know if it was just the right amount of purge.

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.240
 I think it was just important that it

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:33.040
 vibrated a bit more to make it less jerky, so mad.

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.880
 Oh, she is amazing.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.040
 She's still alive, isn't she?

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:37.640
 My Greek McDonald.

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:42.240
 And I think she was the first person to do laser eye surgery.

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.160
 Is that right?

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:43.840
 Yes.

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:46.520
 I think she might have operated on the first lady as well.

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:49.760
 So the first lady was a patient called Alberta Cassidy,

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:53.080
 who'd been just diagnosed with melanoma of her eye.

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:54.800
 And they were going to have to remove it.

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:57.520
 But before they did, so she was so amazing.

00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.680
 She just basically said, if anyone wants

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:02.600
 to do any experiments on this eye while it's here,

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:03.480
 then you can do it.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:06.240
 And they rushed her in, and they did the operation.

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:06.920
 Wow.

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:08.000
 She was very cool.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.360
 And she Alberta Cassidy knew--

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:13.280
 sort of had what they called a dire prognosis.

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:15.520
 And she did, in fact, die a few months later.

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:17.000
 But she volunteered herself.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.960
 Yeah, so they rushed her into a primate center,

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.040
 because that was the only place they were doing laser eye

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:22.320
 surgery at the time.

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:26.520
 And so she laid down on a bed and had to ice-laced alongside

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:31.840
 the shrieking and crying out monkeys and primates.

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:35.120
 Presumably quite off-putting, but yeah, and it works.

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:35.720
 Yeah, it was on--

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:38.680
 Maybe the vibrations of the shrieking might have helped.

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:39.800
 Yeah.

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:44.720
 Now every laser eye operation, you have a chimpanzee next to you.

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:47.280
 Some of the first surgery-- a laser eye surgery--

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:50.360
 was done on turkey dinners.

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:53.400
 So they were trying to test the lasers in the first place.

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:57.000
 This is before they even got to operating on any humans

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 or any animals.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.760
 There was a doctor called Rangaswami Srinivasan.

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:03.360
 And he was one of the pioneers, because the lasers they were

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:06.920
 using were normally for carving computer chips

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.440
 in the right shape.

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:12.280
 And they thought, maybe we can use this for a medicinal purpose

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:13.200
 somehow.

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:17.240
 And so this doctor, Srinivasan, he brought his leftovers

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:21.320
 from his Thanksgiving dinner in, just a leftover turkey dinner.

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:23.680
 And they practiced etching patterns

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:26.920
 in the cartilage and on the bones and on the skin and all

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:27.400
 of this.

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:28.440
 So yeah, yeah.

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:31.800
 This was how they developed it the early days.

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:34.240
 There was another part of development of laser eye surgery

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:38.640
 was a boy smashed his glasses into his face.

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:41.920
 So he fell over and the glass went all over his eyes.

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:45.640
 And it made his eyes better.

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:47.080
 Yeah, I mean, this is a thing.

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:49.440
 So there was a Russian surgeon who dealt with him

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:58.960
 called Dr. Odir, OK, is Dr. F. And he--

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:01.560
 I think he was Dr. Fyodorov, maybe?

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:05.840
 Yes, he was Dr. Fyodorodov.

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:06.840
 And--

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:08.400
 Yes, that's what I said.

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.240
 A Fyodorov.

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:13.040
 So he was treating a near-sided boy, who'd fallen.

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:15.800
 He'd fallen over these glass shards had gone into his eye.

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:17.400
 And the damage was minimal.

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:20.360
 But what it did was a sliver of the glass had shaved off

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:24.000
 a bit of the top layer of his eye, which largely what

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.040
 laser eye surgery is now is to sort of reshape the eye.

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:28.320
 It reshaped the eye.

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:30.040
 So while they were studying him, he was like,

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:31.360
 I can see everything now.

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:35.000
 And that's what made them realize, OK, this is where we have to get--

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.560
 we just got to start shaving eyes.

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:39.160
 And so if you can't afford laser eye surgery--

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:42.440
 No, no, no, no.

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:43.280
 We can't recommend that.

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:44.440
 We can't recommend anything.

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:48.480
 Because, actually, I don't know if you guys saw in the news this year.

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:51.120
 Do you know the pop star or the singer Grimes?

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.120
 Yeah, Grimes, yeah.

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:55.880
 Who was a partner of Elon Musk?

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:58.920
 Well, she apparently has had laser eye surgery

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:03.320
 that blocks out the color blue, whenever she's looking at things.

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:07.400
 And the idea is that she suffers from seasonal affective disorder.

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:09.240
 And by getting rid of the blue light,

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.880
 it'll make her feel better and feel less sad.

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:12.560
 OK.

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:16.800
 Now, I went on the website, lookafteryoureyes.org.

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:21.480
 And they said, this surgery is not supported by scientific evidence.

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:21.960
 Yeah.

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:23.680
 So whatever you do, don't do that.

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:27.280
 Well, how does she know where the sky is anymore?

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:30.800
 It's in the same place as where she left it.

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:33.440
 Well, when she goes swimming, how does she know which bit is the sea,

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:36.400
 which bit is the sky?

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:41.200
 Andy, Andy, did the FAQs for why you shouldn't have this surgery?

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:44.320
 Do you think that when you're swimming towards a horizon,

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:47.200
 if you keep going, eventually you start swimming into the sky?

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:49.240
 Like that.

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:52.400
 And anyway, both those things are blue.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:55.520
 So if you can't see blue, you can't tell the difference,

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:57.880
 but you can't tell the difference anyway, because they're both blue.

00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:58.680
 That's true.

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:00.080
 I can't believe--

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:01.240
 I can't believe I said that.

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:04.880
 [LAUGHTER]

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:08.760
 Well, at least we're not recording it, so you're fine.

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:12.680
 This is supposed to be about science communication.

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:17.440
 We're going to take our shit away from us, Andy.

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:19.200
 Monet couldn't see the colour blue, you know?

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:19.720
 Couldn't be.

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:22.720
 Well, I've got a question about Monet.

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:27.680
 And that's why he drowned trying to swim in the sky.

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:29.080
 He had a cataracts.

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:32.120
 [APPLAUSE]

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:33.200
 He had cataracts.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:37.880
 And actually, a lot of people say this is why his paintings were so blurry,

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:39.320
 and because his vision was quite blurry,

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:41.120
 because when he went into a really blurry phase,

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:44.600
 it was because he had eye problems, which when they were fixed,

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:46.320
 meant that he looked at all the paintings he'd done,

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:48.120
 and sort of tore most of them up and shut them away,

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:49.880
 saying, well, these were blurry, they're shit.

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:50.400
 Oh, no.

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:52.120
 Why have you been saying they're good?

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:54.560
 But he was so annoyed at having to wear an eye patch

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:57.600
 for one eye, that in the other eye, he refused surgery.

00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.520
 And the cataracts, they meant that he could never

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:01.120
 see blue or purple again.

00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:02.280
 Gosh.

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:03.320
 Yeah.

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:06.040
 You know, there's a Guinness World record.

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:07.240
 It's the latest that I'd read.

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:10.640
 Possibly it's changed, but for the longest eyesight,

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:13.560
 for the longest human being able to spot something,

00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:15.040
 the biggest distance.

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:15.760
 But wait a minute.

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:19.920
 I can see stars, which are billions of light years away.

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.200
 And it's you, James, who holds the--

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:24.440
 [LAUGHTER]

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:28.040
 I'm here to present you with your second award of the evening.

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:33.600
 So is she able to read an eye test chart from a long way away?

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:34.360
 Is that the idea?

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:36.760
 So the test that they did on her was to put humans

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:39.480
 very far away, and for her to go, oh, it's Bob.

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:41.000
 And that was it.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.040
 And she could identify someone as far,

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:46.480
 more than 1.6 kilometers away.

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.080
 Oh.

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:48.080
 Yeah.

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:49.080
 What?

00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:50.000
 Her name was Veronica Cedar.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.840
 And she was tested.

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:55.320
 Because everyone at school was like, oh, she can see--

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:56.680
 how did she know the bus was coming?

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:57.720
 It's miles away.

00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:01.360
 And she could actually tell-- she could actually say,

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:03.360
 it's about 1.2 miles away.

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:05.360
 She could judge distances as well.

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:05.860
 Yeah.

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:08.280
 Presumably, they did not just test her with people

00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:11.680
 she knew who wore very interestingly shaped clothing.

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:14.840
 Well, because if you wore your special hat--

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:16.000
 Yes, good point.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:16.520
 Good point.

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:19.080
 If you dress as a star, James would be all over her head.

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:21.480
 [LAUGHTER]

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:24.040
 No, the fascinating thing was not only

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:26.480
 was she able to spot the person, but she could spot.

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:28.920
 She could make differentiation in the colors of clothing

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:30.040
 that they were wearing as well, which

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:32.360
 apparently at that distance is even harder to do,

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:34.000
 because they all kind of blur into one.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:34.520
 Right.

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:35.480
 That is amazing.

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.880
 She'd be a horrible person to try and hide from, wouldn't she?

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:39.920
 Or to run away from--

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:41.000
 Why run away from?

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.680
 Well, just because if you're trying to run away,

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:44.840
 she can still see you, even though you think

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:47.240
 you've got a distance between you guys.

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:49.680
 Well, you should just go into a building.

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:52.240
 Yeah, exactly.

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:54.440
 This is only a problem if you're trying to run away

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:59.040
 from Veronica Cedar on a feature list desert plane.

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:02.120
 You're very rarely playing hide-and-seek on a feature list

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:03.640
 that doesn't play any.

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:04.920
 I imagine both hide-and-seek.

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:07.320
 It's just about being so fucking far away.

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:10.000
 Guys, you obviously haven't got the advanced level hide-and-seek

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.760
 that I've graduated, is you?

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:15.560
 The goby desert Shazinsky Challenge.

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:21.480
 I've got a fact about the lenses in the eyes of Nutes.

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:22.160
 Oh, yeah.

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:23.160
 What?

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:25.000
 So Nutes.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.680
 This is a similar word in German, maybe.

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:29.000
 Nutes?

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.760
 Like a little lizard?

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:34.320
 Roy? Roy? Roy?

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:36.600
 We're never going to-- it's never going to--

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:37.640
 We all know it with the Nutes.

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:38.840
 The Nutes. The Nutes.

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:40.040
 We think.

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:41.040
 Mike.

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:42.040
 Mike.

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:43.040
 Right.

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:44.120
 Mike the Nute.

00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:45.520
 OK.

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:49.040
 It does sound like an Irish person called Mike, doesn't it?

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:52.880
 Oh, I told Mike the Nute.

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:53.520
 Sorry, gone.

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:54.560
 No, no.

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:57.320
 Well, Mike the Nute.

00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:00.880
 He is very lucky because he can regenerate

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:04.480
 the lenses of his eyes indefinitely.

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:05.000
 Wow.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.080
 So a group of scientists tested this,

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:09.360
 because I think it was known that this could be done.

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:10.840
 So they removed the lenses.

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:12.840
 It doesn't have a cruel ending, the story.

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:14.160
 OK, that's the important thing to say.

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:15.840
 I mean, this bit is arguably very cruel.

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:20.080
 But they removed the lenses from a group of Nutes' eyes,

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:22.320
 and the Nutes' grew back perfect lenses.

00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:24.880
 So the scientists did it again.

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:27.480
 And they grew them back again.

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:29.920
 Scientists removed them again.

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:36.360
 They grew them back 18 times in a row, and perfectly.

00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:39.560
 The lenses that were grown back were indistinguishable

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:42.040
 from the lenses of a 14-year-old adult

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:45.160
 Nute that had never had a lens removed in the first place.

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:46.520
 That is amazing.

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:47.520
 That's incredible.

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:49.960
 And then on the 19th time, did it screw it up?

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:51.080
 Yeah, it's screw it up.

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:51.600
 That was it.

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:52.440
 It's 18 max.

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:55.440
 I think they stopped at 18 probably because their ethics committee

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:59.000
 had started asking questions.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.880
 But actually, because I read a story in the news this year

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:07.720
 about a 67-year-old woman who had 27 contact lenses

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:10.400
 removed from her eyes.

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.320
 And I thought that she'd been putting them in

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:14.280
 and then kept forgetting to take them out.

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:18.240
 But now, I'm thinking she might be a Nute.

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:21.880
 It's Mike's wife.

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:25.000
 We're going to have to move on in a second.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.440
 I've got one last thing.

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:29.160
 I was just looking into eyes, generally.

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:30.760
 And it was very romantic, though.

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:39.160
 A number of women in Vienna have issued restraining orders

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:40.360
 now, aren't they?

00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:40.960
 Yeah.

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:42.200
 My wife is not happy.

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:45.080
 Honey, it's research.

00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:47.240
 No, I-- so it's sometimes research.

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:49.400
 Takes you down a rabbit hole and you go to different places.

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:52.440
 And I was looking into eyes and movies

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:54.600
 because we had 3D and how you have eyes.

00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:56.360
 But my favorite fact that I discovered

00:33:56.360 --> 00:34:00.440
 is that there was a movie that was made called "Blade Trinity"

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:02.680
 with Wesley Snipes as "Blade."

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:04.440
 It was a disastrous production.

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:05.520
 And he hated being on it.

00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:07.080
 And he refused to do so many things,

00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:11.160
 called himself "Blade on Set," not "Blade."

00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:14.880
 But the head to head came between the director and Wesley

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:17.760
 Snipes for one scene where they were filming his face,

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:18.360
 just his face.

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:22.480
 And Wesley Snipes refused to open his eyes in the scene.

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:24.560
 And he refused for so long that the director

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.640
 went, screw it, we've done, we got it.

00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:29.480
 And they CGI'd his eyes opening.

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:30.000
 No.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.280
 CGI.

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:33.960
 CGI'd?

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:35.640
 So if you watch it, you can see it online.

00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:36.320
 It's amazing.

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:38.880
 These weird cartoon eyes suddenly appear

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:41.880
 because he refused to open them on set.

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:43.160
 That's amazing.

00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:46.040
 Oh, there's one other movie, "I Fact."

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:47.720
 It just is so relevant.

00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:50.600
 So and it's about contact lenses and eye correction.

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:52.160
 The first use of contact lenses

00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:55.680
 to change an actor's eye color was in a film called "Miracles

00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:59.960
 for Sale," and they used a blue ceramic lens.

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:02.800
 This is really early to change an actor's eye color,

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:05.360
 I think, from brown to blue.

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:08.760
 The weird thing is, this happened in the film "Miracles

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:11.240
 for Sale," which was released in 1939,

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:13.760
 and is, in fact, a black and white film.

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:16.800
 [LAUGHTER]

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:17.800
 Incredible.

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:23.400
 OK, it is time for fact number three.

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:25.440
 And that is Andy.

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:30.000
 My fact is that some inuits, if they got extremely hungry,

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.160
 would have been able to eat their own sleds.

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:36.600
 So someone in the audience said, what?

00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:37.360
 Fair enough.

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:42.400
 So some inuit sleds were partially made of fish.

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:47.200
 This was a thing you could do if you were in--

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:50.120
 frankly, if your normal sled had broken or you'd

00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:51.000
 been lost.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.920
 For instance, if you lived so far north,

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:53.960
 there were no trees.

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:54.480
 Exactly.

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:56.160
 And you wouldn't have much driftwood,

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.360
 and so you needed something.

00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:59.400
 You couldn't make it out of wood.

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:01.920
 So what you would do is you would take three fish,

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:05.400
 this particular kind of fish, the inuit hunter-grate deal.

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:06.960
 They're called Arctic Char.

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:10.840
 You cut them in two lengthways, and you put them in a row.

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:15.040
 And then you wrap those up in seal skin with leather strips.

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:16.920
 So it's made of fish and seal now.

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:19.040
 Overnight, bang, they freeze.

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:21.880
 You have an instant runner for a sled.

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:24.400
 Then you need crossbars, and those

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:28.320
 are sometimes made of caribou leg bones or walrus skin.

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.320
 Some sources say walrus meat.

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:32.400
 So this is a very edible sled.

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:33.560
 We're putting together.

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:36.080
 You tie it all together with more strips of seal.

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:38.000
 And you've got a sled, basically.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.160
 And the main thing you have to do is stop your dogs

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:42.920
 from eating it.

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:43.600
 That's amazing.

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:46.520
 It's like the extension of one of those necklaces

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:48.560
 you can wear that has sweets around it

00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:50.960
 that you can eat if you get hungry.

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:53.080
 They've taken that one step further.

00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:54.480
 Well, they had a lot of fish.

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:55.680
 They like fish.

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.200
 They liked fish back in the day.

00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:59.480
 They like fish a bit less now, since I think in you,

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:03.720
 it's largely, I suppose, invaded by Western culture a bit.

00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:05.920
 So they're now like fish and McDonald's.

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:10.640
 But they would eat seal a lot, but have a huge respect

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:11.560
 for seals, right?

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:13.880
 So they thought that seals would be offended

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:15.600
 if they stopped eating them.

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:17.400
 And so--

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:19.880
 and they would treat them with huge reverence.

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:21.640
 So as they killed a seal, they

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:25.360
 would give it a drink of water to quench its thirst as it died.

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:27.440
 So it'd be like, well, what a nice guy.

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:28.600
 They did that.

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:31.640
 And the UPIC people, actually, who are related culturally

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:34.720
 to the Inuits and who are slightly further south,

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:38.520
 they would return a preserved seal bladder to the sea

00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:42.040
 every year, hoping that the seal bladder would swim back

00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:45.480
 to its seal friends and say, I was treated really well.

00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:47.680
 By the UPIC people, don't worry about them.

00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:50.320
 They're good guys.

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:52.560
 And yeah, that would encourage them to go and give themselves

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:54.000
 up to hunters.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.840
 That is amazing.

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:58.280
 It's a complex morality.

00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:01.960
 This fish sled, I think, was first described

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:05.040
 by an explorer called Peter Freiken.

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:09.320
 And he found some people in a town called igloo lick

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:10.800
 who were doing this.

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.920
 And the name igloo lick, it's a town.

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:14.600
 It's absolutely in the middle of nowhere.

00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:16.600
 No trees is a tiny little island.

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:22.080
 The name igloo lick means there is a house here.

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:27.560
 But also, it is the home of the world's only Inuit Circus.

00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:28.560
 Yeah.

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:30.520
 They're called the Arts Cirque.

00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:34.800
 But they actually were invited to do a show in Marley

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:36.280
 in Timbuktu.

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:38.840
 And so they've gone from a town where it's usually around

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:41.240
 minus 50 degrees centigrade.

00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:43.320
 And they've gone to Marley where it's normally

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:45.120
 plus 40 degrees centigrade.

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:45.880
 Oh, God.

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:47.040
 And they turned up.

00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:49.480
 And they basically couldn't do it.

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:53.360
 And so they're only shows they could do were in midnight.

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:54.840
 And so they would do shows at midnight.

00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:57.680
 And the whole rest of the day, they would just sleep.

00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:58.920
 Because it was so hot.

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:01.600
 But did they have the same animals, like viruses

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:03.000
 and seals, presumably?

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.840
 Well, there is a balloon guy.

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:09.000
 But he only uses the bladder removed from a seal.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.160
 It was a non-animal circus.

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:14.000
 It was more like trapeze and juggling and things like that.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.560
 So cool.

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:19.720
 The uses of seals by Inuit people are very, very broad.

00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:21.680
 Because if you have only a few resources,

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:24.320
 then you have to use the ones you can as well as possible.

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:28.440
 So raw seal liver was a childhood treat food.

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:30.800
 For some Inuit groups, there was chewing gum,

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:33.600
 which was made of seal blubber.

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:37.400
 Seal blood soup was a good thing for new mothers.

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:40.360
 And it was seal blubber oil was used

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:44.680
 as a body lotion and as a fuel and as a laxative.

00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:45.960
 Oh, yeah.

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:47.400
 OK.

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:50.080
 Dry skin, too cold, constipated?

00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:53.200
 Have we got anything for you?

00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:55.160
 You know, you can be proposed to for marriage

00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:58.680
 by a seal in an igloo.

00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:00.320
 You're going to have to explain it further.

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:04.960
 So the singer's seal proposed to his model girlfriend,

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:06.760
 Heidi Klum, in an igloo.

00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:07.440
 Is that right?

00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:08.240
 Yeah.

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:11.400
 I've seen the Canadian Rockies.

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:18.240
 I have never been more disappointed with the fact in my life.

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:22.320
 That's the best fact I've ever said in my life.

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:23.320
 I was low.

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:24.320
 Is that right?

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:26.400
 Because there's no way James is going to leave that in the edit.

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:29.000
 So have you enjoyed?

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.080
 Here's a really, really interesting thing.

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:34.120
 This is quite sciencey and it's due with the Inuit people.

00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:36.680
 So the Inuit elders at the moment

00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:40.280
 think that the Earth's tilt has changed.

00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:42.400
 And the reason they think that is because they often

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:45.040
 tell the time by looking at the moon and the stars

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:46.680
 and where the sun comes up.

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:48.800
 And they found that over the last few years

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:51.320
 that the sun is coming up in a different place

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:52.920
 and that the stars are in a different place

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:54.120
 and the moon's in a different place

00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:56.840
 when compared to the mountains.

00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:59.640
 And the reason is that global warming

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:02.480
 has caused the atmosphere to get warmer.

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:05.080
 And so when you see light coming from space,

00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:06.600
 it refracts.

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:09.800
 And so actually where the sun used to you thought it was

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.360
 is not there anymore.

00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:13.120
 And it's in a completely different place.

00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:16.680
 And their explanation was that the Earth's tilt had changed.

00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:17.200
 Wow.

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:18.680
 And we're just all too scared to tell them

00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:23.640
 about global warming because they are going to be pissed off.

00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:24.680
 Wow, that's very cool.

00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:26.480
 They must have such a specific--

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:27.280
 Yeah.

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:28.160
 --because it hasn't changed that much.

00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:28.840
 A position of the sun.

00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:30.400
 I would have noticed.

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:33.480
 So even in Viking times, you would tell--

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:36.640
 if you live in, say, Babylonian places,

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:38.400
 you live near the equator.

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:41.040
 And you would tell the time because the sun rises in the east

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:42.400
 and sets in the west.

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:44.080
 But if you live in the north, if you're

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:45.440
 a Viking or something like that,

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:47.840
 or you live in the polar circle, then the sun

00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:50.760
 is always rising and setting in different places.

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:52.320
 And so the way that they tell the time

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:54.960
 is they would take specific things on the horizon--

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:58.920
 like, for instance, a mountain or a gate.

00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:01.000
 Not a goat's goat.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.200
 There's old Veronica Cedar, 1.6 kilometers away.

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:06.040
 I know that goat.

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:11.720
 That was going so well.

00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:16.720
 Yes, anyway, there would take something on the horizon,

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:19.160
 and they would use that to tell exactly what time of day it was.

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:20.000
 Very cool.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:20.760
 Very cool.

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:21.440
 But not a goat.

00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:22.760
 Not a goat.

00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:24.400
 Unless you cement it into the ground.

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:29.640
 So there was a woman called Jean Briggs,

00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:31.600
 who was an anthropologist in the 1960s,

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:34.600
 who lived with the Inuits in Alaska,

00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:38.360
 and wrote down what they were like and followed them

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:42.560
 for many years, and discovered that they never got angry.

00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:44.680
 So this was-- and it was extraordinary.

00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:46.840
 If anything went wrong, they would stay totally calm.

00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:50.400
 So there was a fishing line that took days and days to braid,

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:52.240
 and it broke on first use.

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:53.560
 And no one flinches.

00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:56.600
 They'd just say, we had better make a new one now.

00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:59.760
 But not like a creepy zombie, I can all hear.

00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:00.260
 Wow.

00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:03.400
 Did they do it through grit, like is it gritted teeth, or is it?

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:05.880
 No, gritted teeth, totally calm.

00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:08.240
 And then one day, she was walking home.

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:12.120
 And she saw a mother and her young son are saying--

00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:13.440
 and the son had a rock in his hand.

00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:15.520
 And the mother was saying, throw that rock at me.

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:17.120
 Go on, throw that rock at me harder.

00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:18.720
 And the son was throwing rocks at her.

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:22.080
 And she realized that they act out plays

00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:25.240
 where they show children how to express their anger.

00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:27.840
 So and they show children exactly what the consequences

00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:28.640
 of their anger are.

00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:30.880
 So in that situation, she was acting out play.

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:33.560
 The kid was throwing a rock really hard at his mum.

00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:35.600
 And his mum went, ow, that hurt.

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:39.400
 And then the child learns it hurts if I throw a rock at my mum.

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:41.400
 That wasn't a very good consequence.

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:42.720
 She's upset now.

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:43.960
 And this is how they did it.

00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:45.440
 And they act out these plays constantly.

00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:47.520
 And that's how they-- so they would never ever shout

00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:48.560
 at their children, ever.

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:52.120
 They find it bizarre that we would.

00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:55.960
 That requires a lot of knowledge of self and others

00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:56.920
 for the child.

00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:59.560
 Because you don't develop a clear idea

00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:03.000
 that other people have feelings too for some years.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.840
 So a more effective way was--

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:07.840
 So it was still struggling, right?

00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:12.760
 So wouldn't it be more effective to throw a rock at--

00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:14.280
 Yeah.

00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:16.160
 To throw a rock at the child.

00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:16.920
 Yes, yeah, yeah.

00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:18.440
 And then, good point.

00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:20.120
 You don't have children, do you, I think?

00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:21.120
 I don't.

00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:23.240
 I thought that was where you were going.

00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:26.960
 And I didn't know how to get you out of it any more than you did.

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:28.800
 Could it be that they were just training themselves

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:30.880
 for an eventuality where we all end up

00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:34.400
 living on that planet that rains rocks all the time?

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:37.600
 We're going to have to move on in a second to our final fact.

00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:40.560
 One thing they used to do with these sleds we were talking about

00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:43.760
 is they would tie all the bits together

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:46.480
 with something called walrus thong.

00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:49.680
 And walrus thong is a really, really thin piece of rope

00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:51.640
 made from walrus skin.

00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:54.480
 And according to anthropologist Freelik Rainey,

00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:57.640
 it was the strongest line known before the invention

00:44:57.640 --> 00:44:59.120
 of the steel cable.

00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:00.320
 Wow.

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:00.960
 How amazing is that?

00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:01.960
 Yeah.

00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:05.840
 They had such incredible technology in the Inuit world.

00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:08.680
 They made armor out of walrus teeth.

00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:10.400
 And so if they were attacked by animals,

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:12.920
 they wouldn't be able to get through these walrus teeth armor.

00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:15.360
 Or if you're bastard kid, throw the rock at you one day.

00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:18.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:21.680
 I have another thong fact, actually.

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:23.920
 But it is the other kind of thong.

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:28.600
 So the Greenland Inuit, they had a G-string clothing,

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:30.800
 a piece of clothing, which is called a Natsid.

00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:32.920
 And it's made of seal fur.

00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:36.400
 And it's pretty, you know, it's pretty sexy.

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:39.400
 It's strips of seal pelt, but it's very furry.

00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:41.920
 And it's threaded together with whale sinews.

00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:45.120
 And you would wear them under your seal skin trousers.

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:48.640
 But it's not for romantic moments.

00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:51.560
 If you've been looking in someone's eyes for ages and ages,

00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:53.320
 it's actually not for those moments.

00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:57.480
 It's to wear, if you had guests or if you were going visiting

00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:02.160
 other people, you would just turn up in your G-string.

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:06.040
 And Danish missionaries got quite stressed about this

00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:09.080
 when they visited and made contact with the Inuit here.

00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:12.320
 And they tried to persuade them to wear longer undergarments.

00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:13.320
 That's amazing.

00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:14.320
 Without success.

00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:15.400
 Yeah.

00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:17.560
 I'd like to think that in the end, the Danish missionaries

00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:20.120
 adapted, and they all ended up wearing.

00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:22.000
 Well, there's a really good reason for it.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.640
 It's because if you sweat, it's very dangerous, actually,

00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:26.120
 to sweat.

00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:29.840
 So your clothing needs to be able to expel heat and not

00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:30.880
 let cold in.

00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:32.880
 Because if you sweat, it will freeze.

00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:36.400
 So the point of the seal fur G-string

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:39.320
 is that you don't end up with frozen sweat trapped

00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:42.160
 between your buttocks.

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:45.440
 Well, I'm sold out.

00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:46.720
 I go one last thing.

00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:49.680
 We were just talking about how armor was made out of teeth.

00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:51.800
 And I was thinking about how the fact that the sleds,

00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:52.480
 you could eat a sled.

00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:53.640
 That sounds really badass.

00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:55.520
 And I started looking into that territory.

00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:58.520
 Found a guy from Canada called Francis Wharton.

00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:00.480
 And he lived away out in the wilderness.

00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:03.760
 And in the '50s and '60s, they're not sure the exact year,

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:06.040
 but he shot a deer.

00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:08.480
 And he basically shot it because he needed new dentures.

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:10.560
 His teeth had completely rotted and fallen out.

00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:12.240
 But Robbins go get new dentures.

00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:13.400
 He shot a deer.

00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:15.360
 And he took its teeth out.

00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:17.360
 And he shaved the teeth down.

00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:19.240
 And he wore them as dentures.

00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:25.920
 And then he ate that deer that he shot with its own teeth.

00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:27.920
 That's such a threat, isn't it?

00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:30.640
 I'm going to eat you with your teeth.

00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:31.920
 That's amazing.

00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:32.400
 Yeah.

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:34.080
 So that's the way to scare a deer.

00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:40.560
 It is time for a final fact of the show.

00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:43.400
 And that is James.

00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:48.160
 OK, my fact this week is that some bottled water in Vienna

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:52.160
 costs 9,000 euros per liter.

00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:55.720
 And this audience does not believe me.

00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:57.240
 And yet, it is true.

00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:57.760
 OK.

00:47:57.760 --> 00:47:59.640
 And I think the reason the audience doesn't believe me

00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:03.160
 is because the water in Vienna is famously amazing.

00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:03.640
 And so--

00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:06.640
 [APPLAUSE]

00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:09.680
 Wow, OK, guys, it's not that good.

00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:13.120
 And so why would anyone buy bottled water in Vienna

00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:14.840
 because the tap water is so good?

00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:16.560
 But actually, the reason is that there

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:20.480
 is a thing called Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water.

00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:23.200
 And it's used for calibrating instruments.

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:27.200
 And it has very specific mix of isotopes inside it.

00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:29.680
 So you know if you buy it, it will be exactly the same

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:31.120
 every single time.

00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:34.960
 And you can use it for all sorts of scientific reasons.

00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:37.600
 And it is actually 20 times more expensive

00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:39.480
 than inkjet printing.

00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:41.200
 Wow.

00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:42.920
 The reason it has the word Vienna in it

00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:46.280
 is because it was due to the International Atomic Energy

00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:48.200
 Agency, which is based in Vienna.

00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:49.840
 And that's why I was called that.

00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:53.360
 And you have these things that scientists use all the time.

00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:56.440
 They're called Standard Reference Materials.

00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:59.320
 And if you're trying to measure anything,

00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:00.600
 you really need a control.

00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:03.240
 You need a standard to put them against.

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:05.120
 And this could be literally anything.

00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:08.600
 So for instance, you can buy a jar of peanut butter

00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:12.800
 for $761 in America.

00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:14.320
 And the reason you're going to buy that one

00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:17.240
 is because it's a very specific type of peanut butter,

00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:19.720
 which is always going to be exactly the same.

00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:21.920
 And if you want to measure how many peanuts are in your peanut

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:24.120
 butter, you have to measure it against this one.

00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:25.760
 Wow.

00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:30.920
 You can buy 15 grams of specific turmeric for $420.

00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:35.320
 Your grocery bill, James, must be enormous.

00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:36.720
 But the lucky thing is, they always

00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:41.680
 arrive between 400 octillion years.

00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:46.560
 You could buy 40 grams of domestic sludge for $715.

00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:50.200
 So what is exactly what it sounds like, Andy?

00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:50.720
 What is--

00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:53.480
 It's stuff that's come out of your waste,

00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:56.000
 of your toilet, or your bathroom, or whatever.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.200
 But it's very specific.

00:49:57.200 --> 00:50:00.600
 So it has exactly pretty much the average amount

00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:03.400
 of everything that a human waste would have.

00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:07.480
 Well, it's like ratio number two to number one, basically.

00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:08.160
 Yeah, kind of.

00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:11.200
 It's got exactly the right number of sweet con kernels.

00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:12.200
 Yeah.

00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:13.200
 In the--

00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:16.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:21.880
 You can buy freeze-dried typical diet for $912.

00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:25.680
 And this is basically get the average American diet

00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:28.080
 of what Americans eat in a week.

00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:29.880
 And they squish it all down.

00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:30.880
 And they freeze-dry it.

00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:32.520
 And you're getting a little package.

00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:36.160
 And you might want to use it to measure that against someone

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:37.920
 else's diet, for instance.

00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:38.440
 Right, yeah.

00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:40.640
 And it's mostly for instruments and things like that.

00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:43.160
 I was looking for other expensive waters.

00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:44.920
 OK, expensive kinds of water.

00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:49.400
 So there's a Hawaiian brand called Kona Negari.

00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:53.400
 And it comes from 2,000 feet under the ocean.

00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:53.920
 Wow.

00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:54.520
 Under the ocean?

00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:55.320
 Under the ocean.

00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:58.520
 All right, under 2,000 feet of ocean.

00:50:58.520 --> 00:50:59.840
 It's 2,000 feet deep.

00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:01.320
 In the ocean.

00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:04.040
 Ooh, boy, I've really got this one.

00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:05.240
 It's from 2,000 feet down.

00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:08.880
 It's a specific sort of river flowing within the ocean, I say.

00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:10.800
 So it's not salty.

00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:12.360
 I am not sure whether or not it's salty.

00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:13.960
 It may be treated once it's brought up.

00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:14.160
 OK.

00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:17.320
 But it was discovered a while ago, because scientists

00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:20.720
 wanted to use very, very cold water from the bottom.

00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:23.400
 And use the temperature difference with surface water.

00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:23.920
 I know.

00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:25.560
 They thought they could generate electricity from this

00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:26.600
 and power homes.

00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:28.080
 They couldn't generate enough of that.

00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:30.880
 But they had a source of this extra deep water now.

00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:34.120
 So they started just selling it as magic bottled water.

00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:38.280
 And it's supposedly free from all pollution and contamination.

00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:40.400
 It's got lots of seaweed minerals in it.

00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:43.600
 It costs $400 for 750 mils.

00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:44.600
 It's expensive.

00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:46.720
 They sell it to athletes on the promise

00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:51.200
 that it helps you rehydrate twice as fast after exercise.

00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:52.360
 OK, it does it.

00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:57.200
 Well, the main study, I think, that it's

00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:59.440
 based on, is a study which shows that

00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:04.320
 gerbils do better on treadmills when fed this water.

00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:07.840
 And the hamsters on surfbots?

00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:10.560
 So some scientists are a bit skeptical,

00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:12.840
 because it appears that the gerbils run better

00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:14.560
 and rehydrate faster.

00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:15.560
 OK.

00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:17.760
 But it sounds like nonsense, doesn't it?

00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:20.040
 But maybe it's true.

00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:23.720
 Because if you eat super pure water or if you drink it,

00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:26.880
 like ultra pure water, then that really is bad.

00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:28.960
 So there are four types of water classification,

00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:29.720
 I think, in science.

00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:31.640
 And we drink the really gross one, which

00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:33.680
 is the only one that we can actually stomach, which

00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:35.800
 is, I think, is called feeder water.

00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:39.040
 And then the top one is ultra pure water.

00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:42.320
 And that's when it's gone through a series of processes,

00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:45.800
 which basically means it has absolutely nothing in it.

00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:49.440
 No minerals, nothing except hydrogen and oxygen.

00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:51.320
 And if you drank ultra pure water,

00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:54.560
 then it would start leaching all of the minerals out

00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:56.320
 of your body and dissolve everything.

00:52:56.320 --> 00:53:01.040
 Because water is the universal solvent you learn at school.

00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:03.440
 And so it literally dissolves everything.

00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:05.680
 And so if that goes through your system,

00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:09.640
 you're just a big, well, you're a big solution.

00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:11.640
 Hi.

00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:14.760
 I found a really expensive bottle of water,

00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:18.440
 which is the water that goes up to the International Space

00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:21.960
 Station, which is approximately $10,000

00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:24.760
 American per bottle of water.

00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:27.760
 When you have to consider the fuel costs

00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:29.920
 to get it to space, yeah.

00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:31.600
 But that's roughly-- they broke it down.

00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:32.560
 Someone did a calculation.

00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:33.560
 That's roughly what it costs.

00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:35.800
 And which is why it's such a thing

00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:38.640
 where they're trying to work out how you can turn water

00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:41.520
 or urine and so on, that's being water

00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:43.400
 being drunk, and then the urine coming out back into water

00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:44.520
 and create that cycle.

00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:47.000
 So they use everything on the ISS that

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.480
 emits any kind of moisture feeding it back

00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:51.040
 into trying to turn it into water.

00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:53.320
 Do they drink their own urine on the ISS?

00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:53.820
 They do.

00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:55.360
 They drink rat urine as well.

00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:58.520
 There's rats in the ISS that they recently

00:53:58.520 --> 00:53:59.960
 converted some of the urine.

00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:03.600
 So I think it's 74 rats having a P that is equivalent

00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:08.480
 to one human P. So they need to really be going for it.

00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:10.720
 But yeah, that's a problem up there.

00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:12.640
 So but that's how much it costs to get up there.

00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:13.480
 That's very expensive.

00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:16.960
 Listen, there's a type of water you can buy in Japan,

00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:21.760
 which is very specifically intended to be used in an emergency.

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:24.160
 So obviously they have a lot of earthquakes and things

00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:25.680
 and tsunamis and things in Japan

00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:27.120
 compared to the rest of the world.

00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:30.800
 And so they sell this specific water for an emergency.

00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:34.280
 And it's called Zaiho's Emergency Supply of Water.

00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:36.600
 And it says on the bottle that it's safe to drink

00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:39.360
 even after five years.

00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:41.440
 And it has one more slogan, which is,

00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:45.880
 this is water from 30,000 years ago.

00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:49.840
 Wow, so they've taken it out 30,000-- after 30,000 years,

00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:53.160
 just before it goes back.

00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:54.480
 That's the expiry date of water.

00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:55.720
 Amazing.

00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:57.880
 We're going to have to wrap up soon.

00:54:57.880 --> 00:55:00.400
 I've got a thing on a weird measurement.

00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:03.560
 So this was about scientific.

00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:04.760
 What would the word be?

00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:05.760
 Like standard?

00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:06.520
 Yes, standard.

00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:07.360
 Exactly.

00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:10.640
 I found a standard which is not used in everyday life,

00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:14.120
 but it certainly is used in near Boston.

00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:16.000
 There was a guy called Oliver R. Smoot.

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.880
 And he was the chairman of the American National Standards

00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:21.800
 Institute, and the president of the international organization

00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:22.880
 for standardization.

00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:24.000
 This was his whole world.

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.360
 And there's a unit of measurement that

00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:27.800
 is named after him called the Smoot.

00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:33.800
 And the Smoot is the length of him, which is 5 feet 7 inches.

00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:38.160
 And it's to measure a specific bridge, the Harvard bridge.

00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:43.120
 So we know that it is 364.4 Smoots.

00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:45.320
 And that is how they know--

00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:48.320
 and when you go across this bridge, it has how many Smoots.

00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:49.840
 You've walked across.

00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:52.040
 And in order to do it, they laid him down.

00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:53.040
 Oh, yeah, they did.

00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:53.640
 Yeah, they did.

00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:54.600
 So he laid down.

00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:55.080
 He got up.

00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:55.920
 He laid down.

00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:56.440
 He laid down.

00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:57.200
 Then he got tired.

00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:58.880
 So they started picking him up and moving him

00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:00.560
 to where the edge of his head is.

00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:02.880
 But the police over there use Smoots.

00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:04.680
 When an accident happens on the bridge,

00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:07.760
 they'll say it's 160 Smoots in on the bridge.

00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:09.080
 So it's an official standard.

00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:09.400
 You know what?

00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:10.080
 They should have done.

00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:13.040
 They should have a tape measure, measured him once.

00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:16.560
 And then he got a gone home for the rest of the day.

00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:19.840
 More on.

00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:21.120
 I got one more measurement.

00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:21.720
 Yeah.

00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:25.640
 So you can measure what is the most livable city on the planet.

00:56:25.640 --> 00:56:33.400
 And that is the city of rats.

00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:35.760
 No, of course, of course.

00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:37.520
 Well, I've lost the entire audience.

00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:41.280
 No, apart from one man in the front row.

00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:44.440
 No, of course, Vienna has the world record,

00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:47.640
 the Guinness World Record, as the most livable city on the planet.

00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:51.640
 And the way that they measure it is there's loads of different subjects.

00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:54.440
 And each one is out of 100%.

00:56:54.440 --> 00:57:00.400
 And Vienna got 100% in every single category, apart from culture.

00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:02.400
 [LAUGHTER]

00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:03.400
 OK.

00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:05.960
 [APPLAUSE]

00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:08.440
 Now, I've been walking around.

00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:12.000
 Absolute desert out there.

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:16.720
 To be fair, they got like 95% in culture and 96%.

00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:19.680
 But I thought I would look into some culture in Vienna

00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:22.200
 in the Guinness World Records website.

00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:24.480
 And I found the only other record I could find

00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:27.920
 is that Vienna holds a world record for the world's longest twerk.

00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:30.960
 [LAUGHTER]

00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:34.440
 And that was two hours and one minute.

00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:35.440
 Wow.

00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:36.440
 That's the bum dance.

00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:38.040
 That's the wax where you're wobbling your bum.

00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:40.480
 And I like to think that Elena Sterlini--

00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:42.520
 I like to think she was aiming for two hours.

00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:44.760
 And it took an extra minute for it to stop wobbling.

00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:48.400
 [LAUGHTER]

00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:49.240
 OK, that's it.

00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:50.080
 Let's wrap up.

00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:51.320
 OK, that is it.

00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:52.600
 That is all of our facts.

00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:54.320
