1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
 To be honest, I don't know what to say...

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,240
 To be honest, I don't know what to say...

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,520
 To be honest, I don't know what to say...

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:20,960
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Coffin Garden.

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,640
 My name is Dan Treibert. I'm sitting here with Anich Zinsky and Miller and James Harkin.

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:33,240
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

7
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,840
 Starting with you, Chazinsky.

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:44,560
 My effect this week is that as part of the preparation for the D-Day landings, the Allies used condoms to collect soil and sand from the Normandy beaches.

9
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,040
 Why?

10
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,760
 Because they just felt like it.

11
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:54,920
 So this was called Operation Postage Abel, which was the operation that proceeded the D-Day landings to check that they were going to work.

12
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:05,920
 And it involved sending Allied forces out under the cover of night in mini submarines, and then getting them to swim to the beach with a bunch of condoms and scoop up lots of sand in them.

13
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:13,920
 Because I guess condoms are just useful receptacle. I think they ran out of buck, I think they started off with some sort of tupperware and ran out and ended up using condoms.

14
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,920
 And it was to check that the sand wasn't going to be difficult to walk on.

15
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,920
 The wrong kind of sand.

16
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,320
 The wrong kind of sand, yeah. I think they suspected that it was a sort of sinking sand.

17
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,320
 Oh, okay, right.

18
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,320
 So they ran out of buckets, so they used condoms.

19
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,320
 Obviously.

20
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,320
 That doesn't work so much if you're building sandcastles.

21
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,320
 It does tip.

22
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,320
 That's true.

23
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,320
 It also doesn't work the other way around. You can't supply a bucket for a condom.

24
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,320
 Exactly.

25
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,320
 So why condoms? I mean, like, there must have been other things we could have used.

26
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:49,320
 I honestly think they are just a useful receptacle. I don't really know why we don't use them for more stuff.

27
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,320
 Yeah. I mean, they squashed up so small and then they expand so huge.

28
00:01:53,320 --> 00:02:00,320
 So a lot of survival advisors say you should use them as a water receptacle and you should put it inside a sock because it's not that strong.

29
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,320
 So it can't get quite easily priped.

30
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,320
 I'm not going shopping with you if you think that condoms can be used for any kind of receptacle.

31
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,320
 The weekly shop.

32
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,320
 Would you like a bag? No, I brought my own.

33
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:17,320
 They haven't been making counterfeit condoms in China and it's so weird because how do you counterfeit a condom?

34
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:22,320
 I think they're not regulation. You don't actually work. They're just, yep.

35
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,320
 And they've put vegetable oil in them to make it seem like they've got sperm-side in them together.

36
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,320
 That same slippery quality.

37
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,320
 Oh god.

38
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,320
 Have you heard about the spray on condom?

39
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,320
 No.

40
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,320
 I heard of the spray on t-shirts.

41
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,320
 It was like a pecker aerosol but it made a fabric so you sprayed it on and it made the fabric as it sprayed.

42
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,320
 You seem to make a spray on anything if you'd, I mean.

43
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:48,320
 No, but this was, this was, it was in 2006, the Institute for Condom Consultancy who created it.

44
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,320
 And it was inspired by the mechanics of a drive-through car wash.

45
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:58,320
 So the idea is that a gentleman's member would be inserted into a chamber.

46
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,320
 Into a car wash?

47
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:04,320
 Yeah, it's kind of like a little chamber. There's like a mini car wash and nozzles would apply a coat of fast-drying liquid.

48
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,320
 No, that's not real.

49
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,320
 Latex and that would go all around.

50
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,320
 Like I comes out to clean the windscreens.

51
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:17,320
 Yeah. So the prototype meant that you could change sizes and everything, which so they thought it would appeal to men who find difficulty finding cars.

52
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,320
 It would appeal to men mostly.

53
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,320
 Exactly.

54
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,320
 But they had several problems with it.

55
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:27,320
 One was that it had a two to three minute drying process, which they thought kind of killed the mood.

56
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:33,320
 The other mood killer was the loud hissing noise of latex being burnt.

57
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,320
 And also having to buy tokens in the garage before you start.

58
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,320
 Exactly.

59
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:44,320
 What's the point? So is that sort of a green and recycling friendly thing?

60
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:50,320
 I think it was just an innovation for how you could sort of have, you can make your own condoms, DIY condoms.

61
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,320
 I think it shows not all innovation is helpful.

62
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,320
 Other uses for condoms.

63
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,320
 In other wartime uses for condoms.

64
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:08,320
 They were used in second-mode water to protect rifles from water so you cover the barrel if you're right.

65
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:14,320
 They're often used by engineers apparently to ask my engineer about this to keep soil dry.

66
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:20,320
 And commonly used in the film industry if you're doing underwater filming to keep microphones dry.

67
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,320
 Yes, I've heard of this.

68
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,320
 Only 25% of condoms in India are used for their correct use.

69
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:35,320
 Really? Yeah. Are the rest to collect sand? No, other uses include giving a smooth finish and shine to silk saries.

70
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:42,320
 And also cutting and spreading them on roads, mixing them with tar concrete to make more waterproof tar.

71
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,320
 Wow, you need a lot of condoms to cover a road.

72
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:51,320
 That's why 25% are only used for the proper way because there's so many are used for roads and also in other construction they use it.

73
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,320
 Wow.

74
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:59,320
 And pensioners in South Africa have started to rub condoms on their knees to ease arthritic pain.

75
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,320
 Oh my god.

76
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,320
 If I ever go on desert island discs, that will be my luxury item.

77
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,320
 Condoms. This seems like the most practical thing you could bring anyway.

78
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,320
 That's quite funny because you're left alone on a desert island to get condoms.

79
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,320
 It's going to sound like real wishful thinking.

80
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,320
 It'd be the weirdest moment if a woman did wash up after 10 years.

81
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:25,320
 I'm sorry. I don't have any left. I've been using them for soil samples and my arthritic knees.

82
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:29,320
 I'm going to waste water and have sex with you.

83
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,320
 You're talking about.

84
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:36,320
 Do you guys know there's a restaurant called cabbages and condoms that hands out condoms instead of after dinner.

85
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,320
 Wow. That's quite an interesting approach.

86
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:43,320
 And also I had to read it read about options for people who are too embarrassed to buy condoms.

87
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:48,320
 And there's a company I just like its name. It's called Johnny's in a jiffy and they sell condoms over the internet.

88
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,320
 They're tagline as we come before you do.

89
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:57,320
 That's very good. It's just those little nice little taglines that they like to constantly use.

90
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:04,320
 Celebrity condoms is a thing which is very surprising. There was a daft punk celebrity condom.

91
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,320
 No JLS happened.

92
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:11,320
 JLS had them. Daft punks was called get lucky condoms. Makes a lot of sense.

93
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:15,320
 JLS they had each member on a separate box of condoms.

94
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,320
 Do you say member?

95
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:23,320
 So you could decide which favorite JLS person you'd want to use from the show?

96
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,320
 You think we should do our own. No such thing as a fish condom.

97
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,320
 No such thing as an unwanted pregnancy.

98
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,320
 It wasn't serious.

99
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:39,320
 Is daft punks condom is that opaque so that you can't identify the penis it belongs to?

100
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,320
 Yes, it's a big helmet.

101
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,320
 It's back to buckets again.

102
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:52,320
 So a few years ago 5,000 happy meals from McDonald's were accidentally sent out with colored condoms instead of a plastic toy from the movie The Last Airbender.

103
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,320
 And basically there was just a huge misunderstanding.

104
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,320
 So 5,000 children were opening up their happy meals.

105
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,320
 Was there a kind of confusion?

106
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,320
 Imagine you're in the bedroom.

107
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,320
 There's a last airbender toy.

108
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,320
 Let's just play with this. It's much more fun.

109
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,320
 This is the best contraceptive ever.

110
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,320
 But I'll be getting sex then.

111
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:24,320
 So we've got evidence of condoms that goes back to 13,000 BC in a cave painting, which is quite cool.

112
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,320
 Really?

113
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,320
 I think it's in a cave painting in France, in the Grotte de Combarel.

114
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:34,320
 And it shows a man who looks like he's standing there with a condom over himself, probably made of animal skin.

115
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,320
 Of himself.

116
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,320
 Over his whole body.

117
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,320
 Wow.

118
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,320
 Wow.

119
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,320
 Wow.

120
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,320
 Yeah.

121
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,320
 It's definitely what we think it is.

122
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,320
 Well, I mean, all we have is that picture that looks like he's got a covering over his willy.

123
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,320
 But why else would you do that?

124
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,320
 It could be a last airbender toy.

125
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,320
 Some stuff about D-Day?

126
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,320
 Sure.

127
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:05,320
 Do you know that in 1943, when so we started planning the D-Day impatience very early on, which obviously were in June 1944.

128
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:11,320
 In 1943, an early copy of the plans for them blew out of the window of Norfolk House in London.

129
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:15,320
 And was found on the street by a short-sighted old man who went and handed it in and said,

130
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,320
 "I don't know what these are. I can't really read them because my eyesight's not very good."

131
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,320
 Oh, yeah.

132
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:26,320
 Maybe he said, "My eyes are just good enough so I can see the bits of paper, but not quite good enough that I can tell anything that's on there."

133
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:31,320
 Yeah. I can see the address on the top of the paper that tells me it's this building.

134
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:42,320
 I always think it must have been so exciting, you know, in so code words were transmitted over the radio as signals to various allies in the war that you were going to launch an attack, for instance.

135
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:51,320
 So on Radio London, I think a code word was transmitted to make the resistance fight as aware that D-Day was about to happen in the next 24 hours.

136
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,320
 And I just think that must have been the coolest thing.

137
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,320
 So I think the code for that was a poem.

138
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:03,320
 It was a standard of Paul Verland's poem, "Chanceau Dautom" in the Song of Autumn. And that was the signal that the D-Day landings were going to happen within the next 24 hours.

139
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,320
 That must have been the coolest thing.

140
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,320
 Yeah.

141
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,320
 You're listening to the radio and you'll go, "Oh my god, it's happening."

142
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,320
 Should we talk about soil and mud and stuff?

143
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,320
 Sure.

144
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:19,320
 Because according to Britain's leading Earth Sciences organization, the Geological Society, 2015 is the year of mud.

145
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,320
 Did you know that?

146
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,320
 What are we supposed to do?

147
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:28,320
 I think it's to celebrate what an important and ubiquitous substance mud is.

148
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,320
 Is mud important?

149
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,320
 Yeah.

150
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,320
 It makes you happy.

151
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,320
 Do you know that?

152
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,320
 It makes you happy.

153
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,320
 Yeah, playing in the mud is a microscopic bacteria called Michael Bacterium Vasey.

154
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,320
 And they increase serotonin, which makes you relaxed and calm.

155
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,320
 Right.

156
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,320
 That explains a lot of plastic brief photos I've seen over the years.

157
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,320
 All the mud, but they don't like it.

158
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,320
 He thought it was the drugs.

159
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,320
 It was just the mud.

160
00:09:52,320 --> 00:10:00,320
 One tablespoon of soil contains more organisms than there are people on Earth, which is extraordinary.

161
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,320
 Yeah.

162
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,320
 More living things in that than there are human beings.

163
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,320
 And 15 tons of soil passes through an Earthworm each year.

164
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,320
 They eat and poo out?

165
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,320
 Yeah.

166
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,320
 Oh, okay.

167
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,320
 Wow.

168
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,320
 That's cool.

169
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:18,320
 I once read, and I'm not sure if it's even true, that if you get a field full of cows, then the weight of earthworms

170
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,320
 underneath the ground will be heavier than the weight of cows above the ground, no matter how many cows you have.

171
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,320
 Really?

172
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,320
 Yeah.

173
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,320
 Because you couldn't fit enough cows next to each other.

174
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,320
 Yes.

175
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,320
 I don't know if it's true, but.

176
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,320
 Well, 1.4 million earthworms is the average number of earthworms you get an acre of land.

177
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,320
 Okay.

178
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,320
 And what's the average weight of a earthworm?

179
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,320
 Let's all work this out, guys.

180
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,320
 I think this is going to be fun.

181
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:44,320
 Well, while you're working it, you know, acres from an old English word that meant an open field of no particular measurements.

182
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,320
 So you can just be like, yeah, I've got acres of land around my house.

183
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,320
 Scientists have invented transparent soil.

184
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,320
 I saw that.

185
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,320
 It's really cool.

186
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,320
 Yeah.

187
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,320
 It's so that you can plant a plant in there and you can see the roots grow.

188
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,320
 That's the coolest.

189
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,320
 It's just a good idea.

190
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,320
 That's incredible.

191
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,320
 It's a thing called naffion, which is a poly-synthetic polymer, also used for batteries.

192
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,320
 Right.

193
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,320
 So it's not really soil.

194
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,320
 It's plant-brower.

195
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,320
 Potato potato.

196
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,320
 Both of which are grown in soil.

197
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,320
 A potato is a transparent one.

198
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,320
 Yeah, it's okay.

199
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,320
 There we go.

200
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,320
 Should we move on?

201
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,320
 I have one last thing that I just want to quickly mention before we move on.

202
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,320
 Just a movie recommendation.

203
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,320
 I haven't seen it yet, but it sounds fantastic.

204
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,320
 A movie called Killer Condom.

205
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,320
 The tagline, the rubber that rubs you out.

206
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:36,320
 Set in the CD parts of New York City, Killer Condom follows gay detective Luigi Macaroni,

207
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:44,320
 who's been hired to investigate a series of bizarre attacks at the hotel quickie in which male guests have all had their penises mysteriously bitten off.

208
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,320
 Wow.

209
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:49,320
 I'm just going out on a limb here, but it's Luigi Macaroni, an Italian character.

210
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,320
 I think he's an Italian detective.

211
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,320
 So we don't know if they catch the condom.

212
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,320
 You should watch the video.

213
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,320
 That's spoiler alert.

214
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,320
 I haven't seen this movie yet, guys.

215
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,320
 I'm not going to give that away.

216
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,320
 Okay, time for fact number two.

217
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,320
 And that is my fact.

218
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:11,320
 My fact this week is that every second a star in the universe explodes every second every second.

219
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,320
 Every second.

220
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,320
 Oh my god.

221
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,320
 But how you told this fact?

222
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,320
 How many?

223
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,320
 Yep.

224
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,320
 Right now.

225
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,320
 There.

226
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,320
 Somewhere in the universe is exploded.

227
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:25,320
 I read a different article as well that suggested that up to 30 stars in the universe explode every second.

228
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,320
 But I think it's safer to say at least one.

229
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,320
 Yeah.

230
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:36,320
 So actually just researching this whole fact I found really unpleasant because it just terrifies the life out of me.

231
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,320
 Whenever you read any of the facts related to this kind of stuff, the massiveness of it all is horrifying.

232
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:50,320
 The reason I like this fact so much, just as a thought experiment, is we can fit a million of our earths into our sun.

233
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,320
 Size-wise, that's the equivalent.

234
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:58,320
 Our sun is quite a small sun in comparison to the majority of suns out there.

235
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,320
 And so just the idea of one of these things exploding, there's a lot of damage when a star explodes.

236
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,320
 The idea that that's happening every second of every day.

237
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,320
 Yeah.

238
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,320
 I mean that's over 46,000 stars a day exploding.

239
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,320
 But they're really rare.

240
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,320
 I mean comparatively rare even though there's one a second.

241
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,320
 Yeah.

242
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,320
 The last one in our galaxy was 1604.

243
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,320
 It was almost as bright as Jupiter.

244
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,320
 I think that's the last one we could see.

245
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,320
 Yeah, the last one we observed.

246
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,320
 So they think that in every galaxy you get one onto a century, don't they?

247
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,320
 Yeah.

248
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,320
 But I find this extraordinary as well, that the last one that we saw was 1604 and Kepler saw that.

249
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:36,320
 And the last one that was seen in our galaxy before that was Tyco Brahi, who was Kepler's tutor.

250
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,320
 Yep.

251
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,320
 And no one seen one in our galaxy since.

252
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,320
 Wow.

253
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,320
 I find that bizarre.

254
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,320
 If you didn't know better, you'd say they were making it up, wouldn't you?

255
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,320
 They could be, but we've investigated their claims and we have evidence that they weren't.

256
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,320
 And we're still using the remnants of Kepler's supernova that he witnessed in 1604.

257
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,320
 So he wrote it down very clearly what he was seeing over a period of time.

258
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,320
 And we can still use his observations to study it now, because we can still see the remnants of that supernova now.

259
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,320
 And we know exactly what kind of supernova it was.

260
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,320
 And we can actually use that his observations to work out how fast the universe is expanding.

261
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,320
 It's like a time marker in the universe that tells us how fast the universe is expanding.

262
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,320
 Did he actually see the supernova explode?

263
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,320
 Well, a new star appears, doesn't it?

264
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,320
 Yeah.

265
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,320
 It was a supernova in 10 or 6 that was so bright people could read their manuscripts at midnight.

266
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,320
 No.

267
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,320
 Wow.

268
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,320
 Isn't that cool?

269
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,320
 That sounds like a me fact.

270
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:40,320
 I read that there's certain patches of the ocean that are so at the surface filled with little algae and animals that are bioluminescent that you could actually read a newspaper on your boat.

271
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,320
 It's so bright, the surrounding shine around you.

272
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:52,320
 Possibly during World War II when they have blackouts in Japan they would take bioluminescent creatures out of the sea and put them in like jam jars and use them as lights and read things from them.

273
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,320
 Which is so romantic.

274
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,320
 Or condoms when the jam jars round.

275
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,320
 Not romantic.

276
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,320
 Wow, that's amazing.

277
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,320
 Is that true?

278
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,320
 That's definitely true.

279
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,320
 A supernova allowed us to read in the middle of the night.

280
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,320
 Yeah, they're really bright and really bright.

281
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,320
 So one day we might be in the middle of the night and it will just light up.

282
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,320
 Yeah, that's a supernova.

283
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:18,320
 There are 16 candidates I read that prophetious supernova and our galaxy of beast geese as the nearest would be probably spectacular if that one goes.

284
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:25,320
 And, excitingly, it's definitely going to explode sometime within the next hundred million years.

285
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,320
 Yay!

286
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,320
 That's what...

287
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,320
 I think if you say Beetleju's three times, it explodes.

288
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,320
 No more times, guys.

289
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:39,320
 Yeah, because you can see Beetleju's anyway, like just with your naked eye. So imagine how light it would be when it explodes.

290
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,320
 Oh my goodness.

291
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,320
 You'll be reading all night.

292
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,320
 Yeah.

293
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,320
 They can be far away.

294
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,320
 You can not notice.

295
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,320
 So there was a printing in January 2011, a 10-year-old Canadian girl discovered a supernova.

296
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,320
 She was looking at pictures on her computer and spotted one.

297
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,320
 Did you say that's a supernova?

298
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,320
 Or did you say, "What's that?"

299
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,320
 Yeah.

300
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,320
 Well, there's a guy in Australia.

301
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,320
 Bill Bryson's book, short history and everything, and they call him the supernova spotter because...

302
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:07,320
 Bill Bryson basically says that, through a bunch of sand onto a table,

303
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,320
 have him stare at it and stare at it and stare at it.

304
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:15,320
 Take him away, remove a single grain, let him turn back, and he'll tell you that that grain is gone.

305
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,320
 And he spots supernova by just looking at the night sky with a telescope.

306
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,320
 You would have gone nuts in ten or six.

307
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,320
 James doesn't believe this.

308
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,320
 I mean, so that's a downfax.

309
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,320
 The difference.

310
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:34,320
 I can imagine him walking onto the D-Day beaches and going, "Wait a minute, there's a condom's worth of sand missing here.

311
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,320
 That grain, that grain, that grain."

312
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:42,320
 Yeah, maybe I've sexed that story up a bit.

313
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,320
 I mean, maybe it's true.

314
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,320
 I don't know.

315
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,320
 Yeah, I'm sure he claims it.

316
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,320
 Sounds like the kind of thing a wacky guy in Australia might say.

317
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,320
 So, you don't have far away.

318
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,320
 You know how people say you can see millions and millions of stars?

319
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,320
 Yeah.

320
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,320
 I think you know, I think it's like four, roughly four thousand stars.

321
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,320
 It's pretty much the maximum number of stars you'll ever see in the sky.

322
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,320
 Right.

323
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,320
 Do you know how far away we're seeing when we look up to the sky?

324
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,320
 No.

325
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,320
 We are seeing nineteen.

326
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:10,320
 I think that is quadrillion miles away.

327
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,320
 Okay, well then why am I wearing glasses to see?

328
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,320
 I know, two meters away.

329
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:19,320
 TV screen when I'm on a couch and I can see a star, 19 quadrillion miles away.

330
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,320
 No, I don't really understand it.

331
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,320
 You should ask that next time you use the auditions, you should say, I can't read that.

332
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,320
 But would you mind placing that 19 quadrillion miles from me?

333
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:34,320
 I appear to be extremely, extremely, extremely long-sighted.

334
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,320
 That is amazing, though.

335
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,320
 It's extraordinary, isn't it?

336
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,320
 I'm tiny little eyes are taking in light from that far away.

337
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,320
 Yeah.

338
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:47,320
 So, good thing about Supernovas is that is the only place where sort of more complicated elements

339
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,320
 than hydrogen and helium can be born.

340
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:56,320
 And so, the human body is mostly made of carbon, nitrogen, a few other things.

341
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,320
 And they will all have been made in Supernovas.

342
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,320
 So, basically, your whole body was created in a Supernova.

343
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,320
 Yeah, so this is something that was freaking me out on the bus to work this morning.

344
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,320
 Well, I'd been reading this and I was looking at a Boris Bike Stop.

345
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,320
 And I was staring at this metal and this Boris Bike Stop.

346
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,320
 I was like, you came from a star.

347
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,320
 That doesn't make any sense.

348
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,320
 It terrifies me.

349
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,320
 Everything you're looking at was born inside a star.

350
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,320
 Yeah, mental.

351
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:27,320
 Explosions in space, different kind of stars, sometimes really absolutely stunned scientists.

352
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,320
 They have no idea what to make of it.

353
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:37,320
 So, for example, in 1979, they found an explosion that was 50 times more intense than anything previously recorded.

354
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,320
 It was 180,000 light years away.

355
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,320
 And no one knew what it was.

356
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:47,320
 And the people at NASA and other leading scientists said that the odd thing about it was that its source was an area

357
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:52,320
 of only 187 miles in diameter with a whole lot of energy erupting in fairly small sector.

358
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,320
 It resembled a high energy bomb blast.

359
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,320
 And they basically said it was unlike anything we've seen in space.

360
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,320
 They thought it was star wars.

361
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,320
 Exactly.

362
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:04,320
 They thought that what they were saying, basically, we know it won't be this, but what it looked like was,

363
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,320
 we were witnessing an intergalactic battle between giant ships.

364
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,320
 Right.

365
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,320
 And this has led to Star Wars theory, which has been going since the late 70s.

366
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,320
 I mean, it turns out we know what it was now as a new kind of star that they hadn't yet previously detected.

367
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:21,320
 But since 1979, there's a great conspiracy theory that has been running.

368
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:25,320
 You can still see online Star Wars theory that we witnessed an intergalactic battle.

369
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,320
 And the government's been covering it up ever since.

370
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,320
 It's very exciting.

371
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:33,320
 This is like, I think that's almost the same level as, which is fictional in Harry Potter,

372
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,320
 when they have, say, they're having a fight in the sky.

373
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,320
 And there's a line about, oh, they think of the Muggles down below thinking of fireworks.

374
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,320
 So we see fireworks.

375
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,320
 Yeah. See?

376
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,320
 What do you mean see?

377
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,320
 I don't.

378
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,320
 I just proved my point.

379
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,320
 I forgot for a second.

380
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,320
 She was still a kick-fix.

381
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:54,320
 OK, time for pack number three.

382
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,320
 And that is James.

383
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:00,320
 My fact this week is that the Tlatel Camilla cannibals of ancient Mexico

384
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,320
 ate the human flesh with chili sauce.

385
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,320
 Yum.

386
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,320
 Yeah.

387
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,320
 How do we know that?

388
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,320
 So we found some bones of humans.

389
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,320
 And the bones have kind of been chipped with tools and nored on a little bit.

390
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,320
 So we know that, well, we think that they were eaten by humans.

391
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,320
 And they're also stained with chili sauce.

392
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,320
 They have the stains of the spices on the bones.

393
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,320
 Wow.

394
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,320
 So they assumed that they were marinated before eaten?

395
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,320
 Well, you would, wouldn't you?

396
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,320
 Yeah, it makes sense.

397
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,320
 Yeah.

398
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:33,320
 This is a study from two universities, one in Madrid and one in Mexico.

399
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:38,320
 And these cannibals were living about 2,500 years ago.

400
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,320
 Wow.

401
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,320
 Yeah.

402
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,320
 It's good that.

403
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,320
 Yeah, I like that.

404
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,320
 Yeah, it is.

405
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,320
 Because you never think about condiments or anything when it comes to eating humans.

406
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,320
 No.

407
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,320
 Yeah, and I think it's prejudice of us against cannibals to think that they don't have, you know,

408
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,320
 the sensitivity of taste.

409
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,320
 Yeah, exactly.

410
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,320
 Like there's no gourmet, like they're just gorging on stuff.

411
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,320
 No, they want to have a nice meal.

412
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,320
 Like some people don't even think cannibalism properly exists.

413
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,320
 Like they think, okay.

414
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,320
 Yeah.

415
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:10,320
 Well, people do eat each other after a war, after battle or something, or they might do a real,

416
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,320
 real hardship, but they don't think that humans would do it just naturally because they're hungry.

417
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,320
 Yeah.

418
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:19,320
 But then I think there are a few examples of cultures that did so.

419
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,320
 I think that does happen, yeah.

420
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,320
 Yeah.

421
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,320
 I was reading about survival cannibalism, which has seen us sort of slightly more exact.

422
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,320
 We know if you're in a disaster and you have no choice, Ray, or you're going to die.

423
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:34,320
 In the 18th and 19th century, it was seen as something that basically has an occupational hazard of life at sea and that's just something that happened from time to time.

424
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,320
 And the customer of the sea involved during straws.

425
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,320
 If you do the second shortest straw, you had to do the killing.

426
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,320
 If you do the shortest straw, you got eaten.

427
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,320
 Wow.

428
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,320
 Democratic.

429
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:49,320
 John Lloyd told us a story once, which John Lloyd of Head of QI.

430
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,320
 He was at sea.

431
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,320
 Yeah.

432
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,320
 He was at sea.

433
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,320
 It's an occupational hazard when he worked at QI.

434
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,320
 Yeah.

435
00:21:55,320 --> 00:22:01,320
 No, do you remember that story you told us about how there used to be a guy that went around towns?

436
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:09,320
 And I don't know which country this is, but his act was by tickets and he will eat a person on stage.

437
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,320
 And so yeah, he would go around to all these towns.

438
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,320
 People would pay all the money.

439
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,320
 He would sell out all these places.

440
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,320
 And he'd get on stage and they're all going, what are we going to expect?

441
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,320
 What's going to happen here?

442
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,320
 And then the man said, I will now eat a person.

443
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,320
 Who would like to be eaten?

444
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,320
 And of course, everyone would go, oh, no.

445
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:32,320
 And so he would go, well, I can't do my show unless anyone is ready to be eaten.

446
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,320
 Yeah.

447
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:37,320
 And then so no one could return their money because he couldn't do his act because no one was providing.

448
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:42,320
 Could Ben use not specify before he came, like, you know, you need to bring your own person, mate.

449
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,320
 That's true.

450
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,320
 I think it was his responsibility to provide the person.

451
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:55,320
 It puts me in mind that there was a movie in America and they did as a publicity stunt that they were going to give away a baby.

452
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:01,320
 And there was a massive, massive uproar and they sold tickets to this baby giveaway blah, blah, blah, blah.

453
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,320
 And then in the end, they gave away a baby pig.

454
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,320
 Oh, yeah.

455
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,320
 So it was all fine.

456
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,320
 Oh, that's cool.

457
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,320
 When it's not fine for the baby pig's mother, is it James?

458
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,320
 No.

459
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,320
 Is that her child ripped from her teeth?

460
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,320
 Sorry, Anna.

461
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,320
 Yeah.

462
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,320
 Was Captain Cook, he was eaten by cannibals, right?

463
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,320
 I don't think so.

464
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,320
 Oh, you don't?

465
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:26,320
 No, it's often said that he was, but I think generally speaking now that we think that he wasn't, they think that the people who were eating believed in the power of human bones.

466
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,320
 Yeah.

467
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,320
 And not to eat, but they just thought they were powerful objects.

468
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,320
 And so they boiled down his body to get the bones.

469
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,320
 And that's people saw that happening and it's assumed that he was being eaten, but actually...

470
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,320
 Okay.

471
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,320
 Do you know that we got the word cannibal from Columbus?

472
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,320
 Do we?

473
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:46,320
 If you take it from a Spanish word, it was to describe indigenous people on the Caribbean islands, even though he didn't actually believe the rumors that they ate people.

474
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:52,320
 So as you say James, I don't think I've read in the course of this research, like people eating people for sustenance anyway.

475
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,320
 It was always a ritual thing.

476
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,320
 So I think in ancient Mexico, you don't eat your enemy.

477
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,320
 Wouldn't you, if you slaughtered your enemy, you'd eat it.

478
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,320
 Or if people would do it.

479
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,320
 Do you know what rights?

480
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,320
 Yeah.

481
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,320
 It wouldn't be to live off.

482
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,320
 It's always what the neighbours do, isn't it? It's always what the guys down the road and the guys to eat people.

483
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,320
 It's not us.

484
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,320
 Yeah.

485
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,320
 But we also ate them here as medicines.

486
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:16,320
 So people would consume bits of Egyptian mummies trying to eat all of that, expanded to be pieces from local cadavers.

487
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,320
 So we were eating bodies.

488
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,320
 Really?

489
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,320
 Yeah.

490
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,320
 Is it bad to eat human?

491
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,320
 Just look.

492
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,320
 I just curious.

493
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,320
 I know it's frowned upon, but is it bad?

494
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,320
 Probably his name is red meat, right?

495
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,320
 Yeah, so...

496
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,320
 Well, there are bad things.

497
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:35,320
 Supposedly, it's more likely to give you something like variant CJD or some kind of spongy form brain illness.

498
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,320
 Okay.

499
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:44,320
 In Papua New Guinea, I think they were suffered from a disease called curu, which is a bit like CJD.

500
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:49,320
 And that was thought to be because they were eating human brains mostly, actually.

501
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,320
 Yeah.

502
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:55,320
 Oh, Dan, if you'd like to know more, you might be interested in the annual cannibal conference for academics.

503
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,320
 Wow.

504
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,320
 Our papers include, "Guess who's coming to dinner inside the mind of the cannibal serial killer?"

505
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:02,320
 And Bonapetit, a concise defence of cannibalism.

506
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,320
 Wow.

507
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,320
 So, the one was in Manchester that I read about, but I don't know if it was there every year.

508
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,320
 Oh, okay.

509
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,320
 I wonder what the catering's like.

510
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,320
 Yeah.

511
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,320
 When you're queuing up in the canteen and all they have is a load of straws that you know you're in trouble.

512
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:19,320
 I was reading about animal cannibalism because it happens a lot in animals.

513
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:22,320
 And there's an interesting thing with salamanders.

514
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:27,320
 So, salamander larvae have this amazing thing where they get very crowded.

515
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
 And so, they've developed what's called the cannibal morph.

516
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:36,320
 They have wider mouths, broader heads, lower jutting jaws, and their teeth can be three times as long.

517
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,320
 And they eat the other ones that don't have the cannibal morph.

518
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:44,320
 So, you know how we get paranoid during puberty, you know, if someone doesn't develop their breast early enough, or whatever.

519
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:50,320
 These guys must be terrified when they're going through adolescence and they're not one of the ones who's developing this special cannibalistic draw.

520
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,320
 Yeah.

521
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:56,320
 And your best mate is, and you're looking at him going, "Oh, this guy's going to eat me."

522
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:03,320
 They did a study of cane toads. I really like the title of this study. It's called Deceptive Digits.

523
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:07,320
 The functional significance of toe waving by cannibalistic cane toads.

524
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:11,320
 And anyway, it's about the fact that so cane toads, they practice cannibalism a lot.

525
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:16,320
 So, there was one study that found that 64% of the cane toad diet is made up of other cane toads.

526
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,320
 Wow. 64%. Wow.

527
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:25,320
 And they found that the bigger ones who have decided to cannibalize lure the smaller ones to them by wiggling their middle toe.

528
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:31,320
 And make it look like a little bit of prey, I think, or something about that seems to attract smaller cane toads to them.

529
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:36,320
 Of their own species who come and approach them to say, "Hey, man, nice wiggle." And then they eat them.

530
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,320
 Wow.

531
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,320
 Yeah, and hippos, hippos practice cannibalism.

532
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,320
 Do they?

533
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,320
 Yeah, which is weird because they're vegetarians.

534
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:47,320
 Well, I'm a vegetarian except for.

535
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,320
 I did just eat my best mate.

536
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:56,320
 I read an article from the Lancashire Evening Post in 1921.

537
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:02,320
 And it was, you know, how old newspapers used to just have rather than have big long articles, they just have quick report.

538
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,320
 So they just have a quick paragraph of update.

539
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,320
 This is just somewhere in the middle of the newspaper, Lancashire Evening Post 1921.

540
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:16,320
 Brigadier General Bonnet, in a report on conditions in Haiti, declares that the natives ate the bodies of several US Marines, including Lieutenant Lawrence Muth.

541
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,320
 End of article.

542
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:23,320
 I just seemed like such a throwaway tiny little, oh, by the way, some soldiers have been eaten in Haiti.

543
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,320
 Yeah.

544
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,320
 And the weather.

545
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,320
 You don't know.

546
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,320
 And I say a thing about chilies.

547
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,320
 Yeah.

548
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:35,320
 So it's like, there was a study that found that women liked to eat chili for the spicy feeling.

549
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,320
 Yeah.

550
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,320
 Whereas men do it for a social reward.

551
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,320
 Link to this.

552
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:45,320
 Nandos tweeted that they often get men on dates ordering plain chicken, but asking for extra hot flags on their food.

553
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:49,320
 That's what they do at Nandos, put flags on your food.

554
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,320
 To show how hot it is.

555
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,320
 That's very funny.

556
00:27:52,320 --> 00:28:00,320
 I really hope, if waitresses bring it to the table, they say, and we've got one plain chicken with extra hot flags here.

557
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,320
 The mild, mild with extra hot flags.

558
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,320
 Anyone?

559
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,320
 Oh, you said.

560
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,320
 There were some hot sauces, names.

561
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,320
 Yes, for fun.

562
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,320
 Pain is good sauce.

563
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,320
 It's a good one.

564
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,320
 Ring of fire hot sauce is another one you get in America.

565
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:22,320
 And the winner of the hot sauce awards 2015 crazy bastard sauce.

566
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,320
 That's good.

567
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,320
 Nice.

568
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,320
 Yeah.

569
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:31,320
 Could have a beneficial effect though, eating hot sauce because this guy called Randy Schmitz took part in a hot sauce chili eating competition.

570
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:38,320
 He was rushed to hospital because he collapsed immediately after dabbing just a drop of this chili called flashbang onto his tongue.

571
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,320
 Weren't also had an MRI scan.

572
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,320
 Had a tumor turned out, which they removed and he's fine.

573
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,320
 Great.

574
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:49,320
 In January 2013, Dr. Ian Rothwell at the World's hottest curry.

575
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:58,320
 It took him over an hour to finish the dish, which included a 10 minute walk down the high street weeping.

576
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,320
 They're just pure chili coming out of those.

577
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,320
 Oh my god.

578
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:07,320
 The Indian Army, supposedly, are testing out chili grenades as a form of non-lethal weapon.

579
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,320
 These are on elephants.

580
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,320
 Do they?

581
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,320
 Good.

582
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,320
 But then they got cancelled because they were prone to fungal rot.

583
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,320
 Oh no.

584
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,320
 Don't use it on hippos because they're like, wow, even more delicious.

585
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:23,320
 Okay, time for our final fact of the show.

586
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,320
 And that is Anne.

587
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,320
 My fact is that dogs aren't allowed at Selwyn College in Cambridge.

588
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:33,320
 So the master's bass at Hound has been reclassified as a very large cat.

589
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,320
 That's really good.

590
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:40,320
 So basically this guy, so they've just got this law, no dogs.

591
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,320
 No dogs, but there's a sort of precedent that you can have a cat.

592
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,320
 They were quite knowing about it.

593
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,320
 Apparently it was a joky minute, but none of the less the minute hit the internet.

594
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:52,320
 And the minute says, college animal, noting precedent under the master's tip of Professor Chadwick,

595
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,320
 council approved the master's request to drop the very large cat in the master's lodge.

596
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:01,320
 And then everyone sort of taken it to heart and people thought it was just a quirky Cambridge custom.

597
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:05,320
 But in turn everyone would yell, hey, I love your cat after his passive hound.

598
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,320
 But the story went viral.

599
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,320
 It was on the official Chinese news agency on websites in South America.

600
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,320
 And he had to do an interview in America about what you're the dog thought of the situation.

601
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,320
 And you're the dog thought of the situation.

602
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,320
 Oh, he was up and down about it.

603
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:22,320
 But he played lung gamely and resisted the urge to shout.

604
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,320
 She has no idea.

605
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,320
 She's a sodding dog.

606
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:28,320
 But they have been sent you quite a lot of sort of dogs passing off as other things.

607
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,320
 There was a new story if he wants to go about a guy who had two puppies.

608
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,320
 Had them for two years turned out they were black bears.

609
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:40,320
 He only found out when someone threw his house about people trading in the legal animals

610
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,320
 and was like hang on a minute.

611
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,320
 But his puppies weighed 50 kilos each.

612
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,320
 She only found out.

613
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:49,320
 He only found out when it clawed off his face.

614
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:54,320
 I think he only found out when he discovered that you can be punished for earning the wrong kind of thing.

615
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,320
 Some other loopholes maybe.

616
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:04,320
 The 1862 homestead act in America allowed people to go through America and grab a bit of land.

617
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,320
 So any US citizen could go along, find some land.

618
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:12,320
 But in order to claim it they had to build a 12 by 14 dwelling on it.

619
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,320
 But the law didn't say what units the 12 by 14 was in.

620
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,320
 And apparently some people built 12 by 14 inches houses.

621
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,320
 So they could play the land.

622
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:26,320
 They couldn't live in the house.

623
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:31,320
 In 2007 smoking was banned in bars in Minnesota.

624
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:37,320
 There was a bar called Barnacles Bar which found out that was losing a lot of custom on account of that.

625
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:44,320
 And it found a loophole in the law which said that smoking is banned in indoor places unless you are an actor in a play

626
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,320
 who is playing a character that smokes.

627
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:53,320
 And so the Minnesota bar said that they were staging a continuous life performance and that everyone in the bar was an actor.

628
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,320
 Very good.

629
00:31:55,320 --> 00:32:00,320
 This is not a loophole, but I just like in the idea of bands that have happened.

630
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,320
 In 2013 Florida accidentally banned computers.

631
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,320
 What happened?

632
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:08,320
 It was a very badly worded bill.

633
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:13,320
 They were cracking down on online gambling in internet cafes particularly in Florida.

634
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,320
 And it banned I guess slot machines and so on.

635
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:25,320
 And it said any machine or device or system or network of devices which meant that that's exactly what a computer is.

636
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:30,320
 And so in 2011 they actually made it illegal for anyone to have sex as well.

637
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,320
 It was basically they were banning bestiality.

638
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:42,320
 They outlawed and this is the quotes here knowing sexual conduct or sexual contact with an animal forgetting that that's what we are.

639
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:55,320
 There was a loophole in Christchurch in New Zealand where if you wanted to register your diesel car you needed to pay 260 dollars.

640
00:32:55,320 --> 00:33:01,320
 But if you wanted to register a hers you could register it for 58 dollars.

641
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:11,320
 And so a lady registered her diesel car as a non-commercial hers by arguing that whenever she went to the supermarket she was bringing back dead chickens.

642
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:14,320
 How much did she save?

643
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,320
 She saved $200.

644
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,320
 $200.

645
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,320
 Amazing.

646
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,320
 Can I bring us back to Cambridge very quickly?

647
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:26,320
 Because I used this opportunity of looking into something that I've always wondered about.

648
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,320
 And I read about it in a Stephen Fry novel years ago.

649
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:37,320
 So there's always been a rumor that the library of Cambridge for the university contained a secret stash of Victorian porno.

650
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,320
 And Stephen Fry talks about it in his novel "The Liar".

651
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:46,320
 So obviously it's a novel but it's a real rumor that's existed and everyone seems to talk about it.

652
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:51,320
 Recently they had to put all of their books online because they've upgraded into the new world.

653
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:55,320
 And it has been revealed that there is no porno stash.

654
00:33:55,320 --> 00:34:01,320
 And what they do have are a couple of Victorian books and the only titles really that get close to it are

655
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:07,320
 "The lover's going to courtship, floating made easy."

656
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,320
 But if you had a secret collection you wouldn't put it on the website.

657
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,320
 Well this is true but so...

658
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,320
 Oh you'd rename it "floating made easy" so no one knew what it was.

659
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,320
 Did you hear "floating" then?

660
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,320
 Floating.

661
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,320
 Floating.

662
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,320
 I wondered what James gave me such a weird name.

663
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,320
 I'll tell you what, that's why I have to go in wrong all these years.

664
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:31,320
 So good at levitating them, I'm impressed.

665
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:38,320
 But yeah they had this article Vanessa Lacey, who's the manager of the Cambridge University Library Tower project,

666
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,320
 said that unfortunately it's not true.

667
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:46,320
 However she did say good news, there are plenty of pornography from the modern world view to look at.

668
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,320
 Good news, the internet.

669
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,320
 But so they do have a lot of modern porn in there.

670
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:55,320
 But no so far, unless you're right, unless they're still hiding the secret stash.

671
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:59,320
 They did have something very recently and it's a shame that it's been busted so quickly.

672
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:03,320
 There was a book in the Cambridge Library where when you opened it,

673
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,320
 it was hollowed out on the inside and it had chocolate bars.

674
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,320
 You're not allowed to eat inside the library.

675
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:14,320
 And so the idea was that you would eat these chocolate bars when if you were starving and stuck in the library researching.

676
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:23,320
 And then there's a message underneath the chocolate bars which said your job is to now return the book with more chocolate inside for the next person who finds it.

677
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,320
 But unfortunately it's been busted so now that's no longer a thing.

678
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:31,320
 Although at the end of the day you are bringing chocolate into the library and you are eating chocolate.

679
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,320
 It's an odd system isn't it because you might as well just eat your own chocolate.

680
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,320
 Yeah exactly very odd.

681
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,320
 There are only days for the sake of the fun system.

682
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:41,320
 Maybe as if you're working late, you think I'm really hungry, there's no snack machine in here.

683
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,320
 Oh the book.

684
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,320
 I'll check every book.

685
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,320
 Oh the book!

686
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:53,320
 That's it, that's all of our facts.

687
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,320
