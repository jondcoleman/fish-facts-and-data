00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.920
 Hey everyone, welcome to another episode of Little Fish.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.000
 This is the show where we step back from our own four favorite facts from the last seven

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.480
 days and we read out your favorite facts.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.360
 If you'd like to submit some of your favorite facts, podcast at ki.com, send them there

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.720
 and he goes through all the mail and he picks out the best choice cuts for us to read out

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.720
 on this show.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.000
 So we've all had our facts distributed who wants to open up with one.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 I'll do one.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 Let's do it.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 All right.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.520
 This is from Gleb who writes, "Hi, love the show, long suffering, listen to first-time

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.720
 writer Yadda Yadda."

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.640
 So we know you do listen.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.640
 Thanks for sticking with it, Gleb.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.640
 It's not easy.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.160
 It's hard enough doing it.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.720
 Imagine having a listen to all this.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.720
 Listen to all this.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:02.160
 Well, Gleb's fact is this, in the 1930s Pan Am, Pan America, Ellen, were looking for a plane

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.600
 that could safely cross the Atlantic with cargo in one trip for their mail service.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.560
 The guy who commissioned the design process was called "Quantrip."

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.240
 Is that true?

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.240
 Is that true?

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.240
 It's actually true.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.240
 Wow.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.240
 It's stunning.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.000
 I went down a real trip wormhole on this.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.080
 He was a big deal in the world of aviation.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.080
 Yeah.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.280
 He was born in 1899 and he started founding aviation firms.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.840
 He founded Pan Am and he pushed a lot of development of long-range planes because before, you

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.040
 know, did you have to stop on the way like in the Azaz or something, or did they just not

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.040
 do it?

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.040
 I think there was a sort of northern route where you see.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.920
 I had a little hop over to England or Northern Canada.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.920
 Something like that.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.160
 But basically, it was really hard to do.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.120
 And in fact, in those days, I read a thing that in the old days, it took eight days to get

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.280
 from Miami to Buenos Aires.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.280
 Oh, wow.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.880
 So like, it was just a very, very slow process and he set up all these air bases around the

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.920
 world and he conceived this idea of, you know, shortening journeys and--

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.920
 Very cool.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.920
 He was a very big deal and his nickname was Mummy because he was so secretive.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.800
 I actually don't think he needed a nickname.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.800
 No.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.800
 "Quantrip."

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.800
 You're right.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.560
 I think when you have such a solid name, you should probably rail against any nicknames.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.560
 You're right.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.560
 You're absolutely right.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.280
 He worked for being secretive.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.280
 He kept mum.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.280
 He kept mum.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.280
 That's right.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.280
 Okay.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.280
 He wasn't just wrapped up in--

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.280
 No.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.280
 No.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.280
 No.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.280
 No.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.280
 In those little lemon-centered, refreshing tablets that you get on a plane.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.280
 He was wrapped.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.280
 He lived inside those.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.280
 He lived off the plane.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.040
 There's one trip staring back at you.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.040
 Yeah.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.040
 And he was named Juan--

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.040
 He wasn't Spanish at all.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.040
 No.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.040
 No.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.040
 He wasn't remote to Spanish.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.040
 No, Hispanic or anything?

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.040
 Nope.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.840
 He lived in England and he was from North Europe, his ancestry, you know.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.920
 He was named either after his mother's stepfather Juan or his great-uncle Venezuelan wife Juanita

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.360
 or his mother's half-sister Juanita sources very quite widely.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.040
 He was named after someone called Juan Juanita.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.040
 It doesn't matter.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.040
 You've never heard of this guy in a minute ago.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.040
 It's not important.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.040
 But I did the research and I had to--

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.800
 But it isn't interesting that all those people are quite distantly related from him.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:16.800
 Yeah.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.800
 Okay.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.800
 You're right, actually.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.520
 And his father-- no, it's always like his great-uncle Venezuelan wife.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.520
 Almost like they put something in that you wouldn't possibly be able to check using the

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.520
 normal records.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.520
 Yeah.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.520
 There you go.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.520
 Juan trip.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.520
 That's very good.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.520
 Okay.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.720
 Here is a fact from Bjorn Halga.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.720
 Bjorn writes, "Hi.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.960
 I love your show since you've been continuously delighting me with interesting facts."

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.480
 I thought I'd send you an interesting fact myself.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.840
 That's why we're here, Bjorn.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.480
 Juan read a book that said, "A quarter of the iron in the top 20 meters of the ocean is locked

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.560
 up in krill."

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.560
 Okay.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.560
 Ah.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.920
 It's from a book called The Curious Life of krill, because it sounds like they would know.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.680
 But you know, I didn't think there was that much iron in the ocean anyway.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.680
 No.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.840
 So I was kind of unsure how important it is and I also thought is krill magnetic, if he's

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.840
 got so much iron in it, maybe it is.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.240
 Are you thinking fishing-- fishing rod?

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.240
 Yeah.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.160
 That would be a really easy way to fish, wouldn't it?

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.680
 Just shove a magnet in the water anyway.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.720
 It turns out there was a recent study that looked how much iron is in krill in a place called

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:29.720
 Pritz Bay in Antarctica, which I think is named after the DJ Eric Pritz, who made the sun

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.040
 call on me in the 2000s.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.040
 That wasn't--

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.040
 I was fooled.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.040
 I think about you then.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.520
 I did not even question it as you were saying it.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:46.320
 They found that there's 19 milligrams per kilogram of iron in a krill, which would be extremely weak

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.680
 or negligible for practical purposes when it comes to magnetism.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.680
 Right.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.320
 But here is one interesting thing that I did work out.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.680
 A blue whale eats four tons of krill a day.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.480
 So that means if you could take all the iron out of all the krill that a blue whale eats,

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.720
 you could get a single table knife worth of iron out of that blue whale every day.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:05.720
 Wow.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:06.720
 A beautiful fact.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.720
 Would a blue whale go off in the airport at security?

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.720
 No, again, the amount of iron is extremely negligible compared to the weight of the stuff

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.720
 that's eating.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.240
 It depends on what the whale does with the iron it eats.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:26.320
 If the iron is all concentrated and it's a special sort of iron gizzard or something.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.720
 Which I don't think the science has proved or disproved yet.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.000
 I'm fairly sure that it pulls it out.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.360
 Okay, so it's not like there's a cutlery drawer inside a whale that steadily gets larger

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:42.080
 over it's like life starts developing butter shuffles or whatever, it's Farragans tongs.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.080
 No, okay.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.080
 That's James.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.080
 What a...

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.480
 You've taken a little already great facts.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.480
 Yeah.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.480
 And you've improved on it.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.480
 Yeah.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.480
 Well, it was a great fat beyond.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.480
 Thank you very much for writing it.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.480
 Very good fact.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.960
 I've got a fact that's been sent in here.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.840
 It's a bit of a sexy one.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:56.840
 Oh dear.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.480
 You ready for a sexy one?

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.960
 I've been feeling that the way you read it is going to become less sexy.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:04.960
 Let's see.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:05.960
 Let's see how many...

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:06.960
 Please do all this agree.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.200
 It's doing a sexy voice.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.520
 I'm doing my sexy dance as well.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.520
 Yeah.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:11.520
 Here we go.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.760
 Now, so this is from Conan from Singapore.

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.640
 Just like we think that champagne glasses were modeled after the shape of Marie Antoinette,

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.360
 which they are not not true.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.360
 He puts in brackets.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.000
 I'm not the whole shape of her.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 It was supposed to be the coop, which is like their very shallow rounded was supposed

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.640
 to be based on her breast.

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:32.640
 Yeah.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.640
 Isn't it?

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:34.640
 Okay.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:35.640
 So it's not.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:36.640
 It's not.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:37.640
 No.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.560
 And what Conan or Conan are saying is that in Hong Kong, what is true is that they sell a

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:48.800
 dumpling that is named after the breasts of an actress in Hong Kong called Amy Yip.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:55.440
 And these are dumplings that can weigh up to 350 grams and they even have half full boiled

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.720
 eggs inside of them.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.240
 Oh, like with the breasts too, right?

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:04.880
 If my biology knowledge is anything to go by, I think that is how it works.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:05.880
 Yeah.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:10.680
 I actually remember Amy Yip now that I've looked it up because she starred in quite a few

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.040
 Chinese movies that were slightly erotic.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:20.120
 And I remember as a kid in the late 90s, seeing a movie come on TV called Erotic Ghost Story

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.120
 and watching that.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.120
 Wow.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.120
 And she was.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.960
 You could literally we see where it all comes from originally.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:31.160
 It was really steamy like it was like I was way too young to be watching this movie.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:36.880
 What's interesting is because she was known for largely for how voluptuous she was.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.400
 She never did full nude scenes and movies.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.640
 What they did was they used to do clever camera angles that would show side breasts and so

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:47.600
 on that gave you the impression that you think you had and this was known in the industry

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:54.020
 because she's called Amy Yip as a Yip tease and they're not full exposure of Amy Yip

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:55.020
 and movies.

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:56.020
 Yeah.

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:57.020
 Well, well.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:58.020
 And she's really cool.

00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:59.020
 Just amazing actress.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.020
 I would be honest then.

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:04.700
 I sent it to you because there was a Hong Kong connection and I didn't realise I was giving

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.980
 you this prusty and moment.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:09.740
 Cazapolting you back to your first interest in the paranormal.

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:10.740
 I'm sorry.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:11.740
 But I'm actually not sorry.

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:12.740
 I'm interested in that happened.

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:13.740
 Yeah.

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:18.300
 Like prust nibbled on a battle end and nibbled on a breast shaped dumpling.

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.380
 That's a big moment for me.

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:21.380
 Thank you, Andy.

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:24.580
 There's a new company in the UK that's just announced they've launched five actual

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:28.980
 breast-shaped champagne glasses at they I think they've taken some real women's breasts

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:32.940
 and they've they've modeled their glasses on that as a kind of riposte to the French saying

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:35.580
 these glasses actually are based based on on breastsy.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:36.580
 But I don't know.

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:37.580
 Very nice.

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:38.580
 Okay.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:39.580
 What's going on the fact of you Andy?

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:40.580
 All right.

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:41.580
 Here's one.

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:46.260
 This is from Sandeep Jandu, who's a biology PhD student studying mosquitoes.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.460
 So has sent a fact about ants.

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:58.380
 There is an ant which produces offspring of a different species to the ant in the original

00:08:58.380 --> 00:08:59.540
 ant.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:00.540
 It's insane.

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:01.540
 Like a surrogate?

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:02.540
 Kind of.

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:03.540
 You know what?

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:07.900
 I read the story quite recently and good luck explaining that.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:08.900
 Okay.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:09.900
 I'll give it a go.

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:15.380
 Basically, lots of ant queens, they produce workers and a lot of them produce hybrid

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:18.780
 workers taking sperm from another species.

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:20.820
 This is called sperm parasitism.

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.540
 That's the thing that happens in several species.

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:26.700
 But these ants, they're called messo-ibericus, they're incredibly weird.

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:34.180
 They do need sperm from another species and the female queen stores sperm from another species

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:39.020
 of ant and then she uses that to fertilize her eggs.

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:43.300
 But when she lays the eggs, she removes, I don't know if we know how this has done.

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:47.840
 She removes her own DNA or her own species DNA from these eggs.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:53.380
 So she has basically made a clone of the other ant species whose sperm she used to make the

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:54.380
 workers, right?

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:55.780
 And that's so weird.

00:09:55.780 --> 00:10:00.580
 And basically, she's created a completely separate species to herself.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:03.060
 But here's the really weird thing.

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:07.180
 That other species doesn't exist where they live.

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:08.180
 Right.

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.060
 So, where did she get the sperm from?

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:11.060
 Wow.

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:17.820
 What we think happen is probably they did overlap with that other species, like many moons ago,

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:21.980
 but she's been able to continually sort of clone it and clone it and clone it so it doesn't

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:23.980
 matter that the other species don't live there.

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:24.980
 Wow.

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:25.980
 That is nuts.

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:31.460
 The authors of this study have coined this word Xenoparity, which is like a two species

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:32.460
 organism.

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:33.460
 It's mad.

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:36.940
 The explanation I found by one of the scientists behind it, I think, is that it's the equivalent

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:41.480
 of a human having a chimpanzee, like if you were birth to a chimpanzee, but we then use that

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:46.260
 chimpanzee to sire a race of human chimpanzee hybrids to do all our housework for us.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.300
 Are they suggesting we do that?

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:50.300
 They're not suggesting we don't do that.

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:51.300
 Wow.

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.580
 So thank you, Sam, people.

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:54.580
 Insane.

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:55.580
 That's incredible.

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:56.580
 That's incredible.

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:57.580
 I read something, which is relevant.

00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:58.580
 This will become relevant in a second.

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:00.580
 Have you guys heard of Devil's Gardens?

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:01.580
 No.

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:05.540
 So this isn't the Amazon Basin and what will happen is people will be walking through and

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:07.340
 suddenly they'll come to a clearing.

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:10.720
 It looks like someone's just cleared the area, but there'll just be a few trees that are

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:11.720
 still up.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:18.060
 So, for a long time, locals attributed this to a shape-shifting demon, who they thought

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:21.780
 like to cause misfortune and so on, and you'd walk there and you would get bad things that

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:22.780
 would happen to you.

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:26.100
 Turns out when scientists looked into it, it's a type of ant.

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:31.580
 It's an ant, which is called the leminent, and it produces a natural formic acid, which

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:36.300
 injects into a lot of the plants in the area and kills them off, except for certain plants

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:40.820
 that they want to keep, which have hollow roots in them or hollow stems, that the ants

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:42.140
 then nest in.

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:45.500
 So it's their whole nesting area, and some of these areas have been lasting for eight hundred

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:46.500
 years or so.

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:47.500
 Wow.

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:51.180
 And yeah, and so for ages, it was a superstition of the area, but it just turns out the leminent

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:53.500
 has been creating these houses in these trees.

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:54.940
 That wasn't suffering enough.

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:55.940
 Knock it off ants.

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:59.140
 That doesn't mean it's hardly fair to play in the ants.

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:00.140
 No, I'm not.

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:03.180
 I'm completely, completely, completely, yeah.

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:04.180
 Yeah.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:05.180
 Hey, when we get more facts, James?

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:07.500
 Yeah, here's one from Harrison Lee.

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:12.060
 Harrison Lee writes that I am currently vacationing in Salzburg, Austria, the birthplace

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:17.340
 of Mozart, and learned that Mozart chocolate has nothing to do with Mozart.

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:21.780
 The chocolate was invented one hundred years after his death, further than most commonly

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:25.620
 sold Mozart chocolates made by a German company, Reba.

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:32.300
 Wait, are they suggesting that as well as composing amazing chews, Mozart started a line

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:33.300
 of chocolate?

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:36.700
 I'll be honest, I wasn't massively surprised Harrison by this.

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:38.900
 I didn't think Mozart made these.

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:41.940
 He appears on, I've been there at Salzburg.

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:45.580
 He's on the chocolate itself, is that called Mozart Balls?

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:46.580
 Yeah.

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:49.900
 But do you know who invented them first?

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:51.700
 Who invented the Mozart Balls first?

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:52.700
 Eighth Hoven.

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:53.700
 No, no.

00:12:53.700 --> 00:13:00.300
 I can't tell you Paul first invented them.

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:04.980
 He was a guy, but he was from Salzburg and Ferdinand, but yeah, they're now made by this

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:05.980
 German company.

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:06.980
 Right.

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:09.620
 Peter's second must have been absolutely gutted.

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:13.300
 Have you guys ever flown out of Salzburg on an airplane?

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:14.300
 I haven't.

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:18.820
 As someone who's a nervous flyer, it's one of the most terrifying runways because the runway

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:22.540
 at the end of it is just a giant cliff face.

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:26.180
 So if you haven't got the right height, you're just going bang into the cliff face.

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:30.260
 As they go along the runway, do the planes go, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh,

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:31.260
 yeah, yeah.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.260
 It's a joke about Beethoven's fifth.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:34.260
 This is Mozart.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:35.260
 Well, I'm talking Mozart.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.260
 Please edit that, edit that, edit that.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:44.020
 Beethoven was from Vienna.

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:45.340
 Carry on.

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:46.340
 Yep.

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:55.540
 That reminds me of, similarly in Bhutan, in Tim Pu Airport, you come out of the airport

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:59.220
 off the runway right in front of you is a cliff.

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:03.100
 So you bank left to get out of the cliff, and when you bank left, there's another cliff.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:04.100
 Oh my god.

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:05.100
 You have to bank right to get out of this.

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:07.180
 You have to do a zigzag to get out.

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:10.260
 Geez, that's why I could arrive in Bhutan, but never leave if I win.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:11.260
 That is not.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.140
 That and you also would probably marry a Yeti.

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:14.140
 Yes.

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:15.140
 Oh yeah.

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:16.140
 Yes, exactly.

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:19.620
 I was sat on that plane, by the way, when we were taking off next to a pilot who was hitching

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:20.620
 a ride.

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:22.620
 And I said to him, he wasn't hitching.

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:26.980
 He wasn't just stood on the runway and he stopped out.

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:27.980
 Yeah, he wasn't.

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:28.980
 We pulled over.

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:30.580
 I opened the emergency door.

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.940
 He was, I said to him, this is crazy.

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:35.340
 You've got a cliff at the end of the runway.

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:40.300
 What happens if you, if you go too low, and he just went, don't go too low?

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:41.300
 Yeah.

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:43.620
 Like the cockiness of these guys, but you've got to have it, right?

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:45.700
 So there's a cliff at the end of the, so it's not a cliff edge.

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:46.700
 No, it's a cliff.

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:47.700
 It's a cliff.

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:48.700
 It's a cliff.

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:49.700
 It's a cliff, right?

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:50.700
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.700
 So the, the, the, the, the, the joke doesn't work for that reason either.

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:55.940
 Well, I don't think we need to spread any more time on that joke.

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:56.940
 Let's get to know it.

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:57.940
 Stay there.

00:14:57.940 --> 00:14:58.940
 What joke, you mean?

00:14:58.940 --> 00:14:59.940
 [laughs]

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:00.940
 [music]

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:01.940
 Why didn't you do the fact?

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:02.940
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:03.940
 All right.

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:04.940
 Yeah, yeah.

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:05.940
 Yeah, yeah.

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:12.460
 So this is from Kerry in Queensland.

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:18.140
 And she says, I love Antibody Intrivia on the podcast, and here's one that I found.

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:24.860
 In 1873, Bush Ranger Harry Redford was unanimously acquitted of cattle theft only because

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:28.340
 the jury was so impressed by how he managed the feat.

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:29.340
 [laughs]

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:30.340
 That's good.

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:31.340
 Yeah.

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:33.780
 So this is, it's a pretty amazing story.

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:38.500
 This guy, this guy Harry Redford, he's, there's, there's Redford Redford, there's different

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:39.500
 spellings of his name.

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:43.700
 Well, Australian listeners don't mind if we mispronounce that.

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:44.700
 We are terrible.

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:48.740
 Queensland, Queensland, I'm so nervous about how I said that.

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:57.180
 But so basically, he stole the numbers vary from 300 to 1000 cattle, and he knew that he couldn't

00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:01.180
 sell them locally, so he had to get to another bit of Australia.

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:06.980
 He decided to cross 1,500 kilometers worth of Australian desert.

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:09.300
 Was it the Nalaba played?

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:12.100
 Don't do it, don't do it.

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:16.860
 This is only 10 years earlier, Birken Will's, who were two explorers, who tried to do the

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:21.500
 same feat, died in this process, so they didn't bring a thousand cows to eat.

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:22.500
 Did they?

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:23.500
 Yes.

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:24.500
 The full mistake.

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:25.500
 I'm always bringing a thousand.

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:29.780
 No, so he, he managed this, and so at the trial, the very fact that he'd managed this amazing

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:34.100
 feat kind of acquitted him, because they just thought that's too impressive.

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:35.100
 And then it sounds like the...

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:37.980
 It doesn't really feel like that's how it should work.

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:38.980
 No.

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:42.460
 I think if I munked someone, then I ran away to the North Pole, and I was the first person

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:44.660
 who'd ever done it, with their wallet.

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:45.660
 You know what I mean?

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:47.860
 I think that sort of does take precedence.

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:50.860
 Yeah, I think the judge, because it was up to the jury to the side.

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:54.420
 He said, "You're lucky, it wasn't me deciding because the jury were the ones."

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:59.100
 And then there's a weird detail that we've been sent by Kerry, which says that his trial

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:02.740
 was delayed for more than a year, because of how long it took to gather the witnesses,

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:03.740
 one of whom was a bull.

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:04.740
 Oh, come on.

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:14.860
 It's a call, 999 more bulls.

00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:18.300
 Yeah, so that's the story of Harry Redford.

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:19.300
 Andy.

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:21.620
 Yeah, I've actually got another Aussie one.

00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:28.660
 This is from Ari Tune Samanson, and it's that the annual Henley on Todd Regatta in Australia,

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:35.940
 was cancelled in 1993, because the river Todd was wet.

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:40.180
 There's a river, which is normally dry.

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:44.740
 And there's a place, Henley on Todd Regatta happens, it's in Alice Springs.

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:45.740
 Oh yeah.

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:46.740
 Yeah.

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:51.140
 Made famous, of course, by Neville Shoes Brilliant Novel, a town like Alice, which is not

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:54.220
 actually set in Alice Springs, it's just about a town that's like Alice Springs.

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:55.220
 Anyway.

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:56.220
 Is it?

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:57.220
 Yeah.

00:17:57.220 --> 00:18:03.220
 It's Dor to Alice, that song by Roy Chubby Brown, that was about someone who lived in the next

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:04.220
 town.

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:05.220
 Yeah.

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:12.700
 International listeners, if you don't know who Roy Chubby Brown is, don't look him up.

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:14.740
 What a source to bring in.

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:15.740
 No.

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:23.580
 With a gun to my head, I would not have guessed the next name will be Roy Chubby Brown.

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:30.420
 My name is Royston Vasey, which is where the legal gentleman fake town is set.

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:31.420
 Yeah.

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:32.420
 It was based in Royston Vasey.

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:34.460
 Roy Chubby Brown's real name is Royston Vasey.

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:35.460
 Yeah.

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:36.460
 Yeah.

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:37.460
 Good trivia.

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:38.460
 Great trivia.

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:39.460
 We can always pull it back, aren't we?

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:40.460
 Absolutely.

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:41.460
 Anyway.

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:43.740
 But this is the world's only dry riverboating event.

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:47.660
 People make boats and then they run along with them like the Flintstones.

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:52.980
 In the dry riverbed, that's been going on for, I think about 60 years now, but in 1993 there

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:53.980
 was flooding.

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:55.980
 And I had to be cancelled because the railing was wet.

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:56.980
 Yes, it was.

00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:57.980
 Great.

00:18:57.980 --> 00:18:58.980
 Okay.

00:18:58.980 --> 00:18:59.980
 Here's the last one from me by Dave Rool.

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:03.400
 Dave Rool writes, "Long time less than a first-time call, I thought you might appreciate this

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:06.780
 list of things unexpectedly named after people.

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:10.060
 I had heard most of these, but definitely not all of them."

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:15.360
 So, Google's page rank, which is the tool for ranking web pages, is named after Larry

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:16.360
 Page.

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:17.360
 Okay.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.360
 Yeah.

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:24.240
 Street San Francisco is named after Charles Mayne.

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:30.600
 Snowflake Arizona is named after two people, Mr. Snow and Mr. Flake, and Taco Bell is named

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.600
 after a guy called Glen Bell.

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:33.600
 Wow.

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:34.600
 That's good.

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:35.600
 That's really good.

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:36.600
 Snowflake is amazing.

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:42.880
 So, I looked into my files for some more sort of weirdly named things.

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:48.240
 The insult dum-dum, like if you call someone a dum-dum, that's named after a town and

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.240
 India.

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:50.240
 Oh, is it?

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.240
 Right.

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:52.240
 Yeah.

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:54.200
 Because you think it's because someone's dumb, but actually there's like a bun on that, because

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:58.700
 dum-dums were a type of bullet, and these bullets were first made in the town called

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:01.160
 Dum-Dum, near Kolkata.

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:09.160
 German chocolate cake is named after someone called Samuel German.

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:12.880
 And that was, it was invented in the US.

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:20.440
 And the Indonesian football team called Seaman Padang is named after a local cement company

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.680
 called Seaman Cement.

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:22.680
 Oh, wow.

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:23.680
 Wow.

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.680
 That's going to say David Seaman, the goalie, but...

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:28.440
 Yes, that would have been good.

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:29.440
 Seaman Cement.

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:30.440
 Yeah.

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:31.440
 That's great.

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.040
 You can bake your own jokes up for that one.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:34.040
 Absolutely.

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:36.040
 Well, brilliant.

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:38.520
 Thank you, everyone, for sending in your facts.

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:42.000
 We're going to be doing this every Monday, but before we wrap up today, we have a very

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.240
 important job to do, which is that members of the highest level of club fish, known as

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:52.640
 Friends of the Podcasts, all as a reward for joining us at that highest bit, get given

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:58.160
 custodianship over one of the facts that we have done over the past 11 years of fish episodes,

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:02.320
 and so we are now going to dish out some more facts to some of those people.

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:03.720
 So, Andy, let's start with you.

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:04.720
 Yeah, I got one.

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.480
 This goes out to Stu Rottenbury.

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:07.480
 Congratulations, Stu.

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:10.040
 Your fact is one of my old facts.

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.040
 It's that.

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:20.360
 Tori and Prime Minister both started out as insults and you could say, "These still

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:21.360
 are, actually."

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:22.360
 Oh, wow.

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:23.360
 Yeah.

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:24.360
 Yeah.

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:27.720
 Well, the kind of satire over there.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:28.720
 Yeah.

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.240
 I think Tori is a kind of Irish raider.

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:32.240
 Yeah, that's right.

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.800
 He was a kind of bandit who operated in Ireland.

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:38.600
 And I think Prime Minister was the idea that you were taking the piss that this person thinks

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:41.000
 they're in charge when actually they're ahead of us.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 A larger group of people.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 You think you're great.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000
 That's it.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 Exactly that.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000
 Yeah.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.000
 Okay.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 Well, here is one.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 This was originally by Anna.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.120
 And it's now under the custodianship of another Anna, Anna Dalin.

00:21:54.120 --> 00:22:00.680
 And Anna says that in a 2005 questionnaire about substance abuse, one in five admitted to

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:03.880
 taking a drug, which doesn't exist.

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:07.080
 Can anyone remember the name of the drug?

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:08.600
 I think it was called Derbysol.

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:09.600
 Derbysol?

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:10.600
 Yeah.

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:11.600
 Wow.

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:12.600
 Wow.

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:13.600
 That's right.

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:14.600
 This is episode 11.

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:16.600
 Yeah, I can't remember anything from episode 12 to 600.

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:17.600
 But yeah.

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:18.600
 Yeah.

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:19.600
 Derbysol, that's right.

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:20.600
 That's right.

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:22.400
 So it was just basically they put in the load of drugs.

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.400
 Have you taken them?

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:27.400
 And they put in this one that didn't exist just to catch people out who were like.

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:28.400
 Lovely.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.400
 Brilliant.

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:30.400
 Okay.

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:31.400
 Well, let's do another one.

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.400
 This one goes to a group of people.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:33.400
 Team Charnady.

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:34.400
 Team Charnady.

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:35.400
 What do you think?

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.000
 What's that pronunciation?

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 Charnady.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000
 It could be that this person's first name is Team.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 That's true.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 That's true.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000
 Or it could be Team Charlotte and Eddie, Charnady.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 Yes.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000
 Oh, like maybe it's Charles and Eddie.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000
 They've synced us from the 1990s.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 Or Prince Charles.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 Oh!

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.000
 Would I like them?

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 Would I lie to you, baby?

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 Would I lie to you?

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 Oh, my James.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000
 Yes.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 You're throwing in a lot of references that have even got rid of me as an understanding.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000
 Well, this is...

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.480
 It could be Prince Charles and Prince Edward, of course.

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:10.480
 Either way, it's suddenly a celeb pack show.

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.480
 This is very exciting.

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:16.480
 Your Highnesses and excellent musicians.

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:17.480
 Thank you for listening.

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:22.480
 And you now are the custodians of a fact that I said in episode 11,

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:27.480
 which is that sea otters have a secret pocket that they like to keep their stones in.

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:28.480
 Very good.

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:30.480
 It's a special secret pocket.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:31.480
 It's a secret pocket.

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:34.480
 Much like the royal family have their own jewels.

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:35.480
 Yes.

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:36.480
 Brilliant.

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.480
 They keep in a secret tower in the little family.

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:39.480
 Exactly.

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:40.480
 Yes.

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:42.480
 And they're in secrets, which we don't need to get into.

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:43.480
 We don't.

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:45.480
 Not while they're listening, anyway.

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:49.480
 But yeah, so thank you very much to team.

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:50.480
 Absolutely.

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:51.480
 Okay.

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:52.480
 Why don't we get one from you, Andy?

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:53.480
 All right.

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:57.480
 This fact goes out to Dries Belinks.

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:02.480
 And it's that knobs have been made illegal in Vancouver.

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.480
 I'm referring to calls to door knobs.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:07.480
 This was the James fact.

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:10.480
 It's absolutely straight on brand for me, isn't it?

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:11.480
 Yes.

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.480
 Make it sound a bit more rude than it actually is.

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:15.480
 I think this was an early day classic.

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:19.480
 And I've said this a few times about the early day classics of no such thing as a fish.

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:24.480
 But the reason I say it is for this one is, do you remember in the very early days of fish,

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:26.480
 we produce some business cards.

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:31.480
 So when we started out, we handed out business cards to people saying we've got this new podcast.

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:34.480
 And on the back of it, it had a fact from each one of us.

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:37.480
 And that was your fact, James, for your business card.

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.480
 Very few podcasts, I think, now have business cards.

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:40.480
 And I think that was a shame.

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:41.480
 Well, yeah.

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:42.480
 Because look what it did for us.

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.480
 Yeah.

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:44.480
 Here we are 11 years later.

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:45.480
 Oh, no, absolutely.

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:49.480
 But the off menu boys, I don't think you're carrying around a stack of cards with the fact about food on them.

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:50.480
 And that's why who?

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:51.480
 Couldn't agree more.

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:52.480
 All right.

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:53.480
 Well, okay.

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:54.480
 Next fact.

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:58.480
 I just want to say that I really like off menu and those guys, if they want to come on our podcast,

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:00.480
 I would be more than welcome.

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:01.480
 That's a good point.

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:02.480
 Okay.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.480
 Let's get to another fact here.

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.480
 So we have episode 12.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.480
 We're now going into James.

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:09.480
 Why don't you give us this one?

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:10.480
 Okay.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:11.480
 I can tell you mine from episode 12.

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:13.480
 It was the first fact in that episode.

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:19.480
 And it was that if the new Godzilla, which is very much now the old Godzilla,

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:25.480
 if the new Godzilla existed, it would produce 12.9 million gallons of urine a day.

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:29.480
 And that fact is now under the custodian ship of Douglas Owen.

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:31.480
 So congratulations to you, Douglas.

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:33.480
 Very, very nice.

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:34.480
 Brilliant fact.

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:36.480
 So I guess there must have been a new Godzilla film out.

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:37.480
 Right.

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:42.480
 I think it was made by Garret Edwards, who you and I had on the museum of curiosity.

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.480
 So we knew Garret, we had a few nights out with him.

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:45.480
 I saw it in the cinema.

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:46.480
 Yeah.

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:47.480
 There's a very exciting bit.

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:48.480
 Spoiler alert.

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:49.480
 Sorry.

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:50.480
 Yeah.

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:52.480
 What's the exciting bit?

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.480
 It's just a bit where some people are trying to parachute down.

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:55.480
 I believe on to Godzilla.

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:56.480
 It's an exciting moment.

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:59.480
 It's been a while since I've seen the film, because this was 11 years ago.

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:00.480
 Yeah.

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:01.480
 Yeah.

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:02.480
 12.9 million gallons a day.

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:03.480
 Makes you think.

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:06.480
 How many gallons are there in it say an Olympic swimming pool?

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:08.480
 660,000 gallons.

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:09.480
 So that's.

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:13.480
 No, so that's 20 Olympic swimming pools of urine a day.

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:14.480
 Hmm.

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:15.480
 And that's going to.

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.480
 Oh, it's going to ruin those Olympics, isn't it?

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:18.480
 Right.

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:20.480
 Let's get a few more.

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:22.480
 Andy, do you want to read the next one?

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:26.480
 This is a fact that goes out to Stephen Armstrong Worthington.

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:28.480
 Congratulations to you, Stephen.

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:29.480
 It's a great fact.

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:30.480
 It's that.

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:31.480
 I love this fact.

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:39.480
 The real Long John Silver from Treasure Island was farther to the real Wendy from Peter Pan.

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:40.480
 What?

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:41.480
 I know.

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:42.480
 I know.

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:45.480
 Do we really know who the real Long John Silver was?

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:51.480
 Well, he was inspired by William Henley, who was a writer and an athlete.

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:55.480
 And he also started that regatta in Australia.

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:56.480
 Yeah.

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:57.480
 Yeah.

00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:58.480
 Yeah, amazing guy.

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:00.480
 He wrote this poem Invictus.

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:05.480
 It was all about being unconquered and it's all about being a, you know, knowing, being captain of your soul.

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:06.480
 It's quite a stirring stuff.

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:11.480
 And so he clearly, um, and he had a daughter who was called Margaret Henley.

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:15.480
 And that inspired Jerem Barry to choose the name Wendy for Peter Pan.

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:16.480
 Oh, okay.

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:19.480
 Yeah, because she was his Flandy Wendy.

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:20.480
 That's it.

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:21.480
 Very nice.

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:22.480
 Yeah.

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:23.480
 So anyway, I love that fact.

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:24.480
 There you go.

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.480
 Congratulations, Stephen.

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:26.480
 Okay.

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:27.480
 Let's go another one.

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:31.480
 This was my fact from episode 12, and this is going to shorn Donoway.

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:37.480
 The fact is that tinfoil hats, worn by conspiracy theorists, would actually amplify the signal.

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:38.480
 Very good.

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:39.480
 Brilliant.

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:45.480
 So the idea, if you don't know it, is that people believe that if you wear tinfoil hats, it's going to stop the government from getting into your brain,

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:46.480
 getting signals out of there.

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:49.480
 So it's an anti-stealing ideas device.

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:56.480
 And then some scientists did a test on it, and they worked out that if anything,

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:59.480
 it would amplify a signal rather than decrease it.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:02.480
 And that's why you wear the anti-fifety bracelet, isn't it, then?

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:05.480
 Because that's been proven to work under lab conditions.

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:06.480
 And they work with proof.

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:07.480
 Yeah.

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:10.480
 There you go, shorn Donoway.

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:11.480
 It's a great story, great study.

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:12.480
 Shall we do one more?

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:13.480
 Let's do one more.

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:22.480
 The fact that now belongs to Shona McLean, that geese sometimes fly upside down to lose heights quickly when coming into land,

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:25.480
 but their head and neck stay the right way up.

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:28.480
 And this is called whiffling.

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:31.480
 It's got Murray all over it, that fact.

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:32.480
 I love this fact.

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:33.480
 He loves a whiffle.

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:36.480
 This is probably the fact if someone asked me for a fact.

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:38.480
 It's one of the top two or three that occurred to me to say to someone.

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:39.480
 Is it?

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:43.480
 Yeah, there's one inappropriate one, which I can't remember, oh, it's about kangaroos and they're intimate parts.

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:47.480
 And then this fact is the one I say when I've got rid of that fact from my head.

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:49.480
 And it gives you a geese fly upside down.

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:51.480
 And if you've never seen a photo of a goose whiffling, it's amazing.

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:52.480
 You got to Google it.

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:53.480
 Very cool.

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:54.480
 Because they look so silly.

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:55.480
 Yeah, it is incredible.

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:56.480
 Well, there we go.

00:28:56.480 --> 00:29:00.480
 We've dished out eight new custodians facts for this episode.

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:01.480
 Congratulations to you all.

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.480
 Hope you're happy with the facts that you got.

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:08.480
 If you would like to get one of your own facts, well, all you need to do is go to patreon.com.

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.480
 Slash, no such thing as a fish.

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:15.480
 And if you join the friend of the podcast here, you automatically will be issued one.

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:19.480
 And then we will read it out at some point on one of these episodes.

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:23.480
 Otherwise, if you want to send a fact in for little fish podcast at qi.com.

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:25.480
 And he goes through it all as I said at the top.

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:30.480
 And he'll pick some more for next week's episodes to get hunting and send them in.

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:31.480
 All right, everyone.

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:32.480
 We'll see you again next week.

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:35.480
 And we'll also see you on Friday for the main no such thing as a fish episode.

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:45.480
 And until then, goodbye.

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:47.540
 (upbeat music)
