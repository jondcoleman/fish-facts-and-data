00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,920
 Hey everyone, welcome to another episode of Little Fish.

3
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,000
 This is the show where we step back from our own four favorite facts from the last seven

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,480
 days and we read out your favorite facts.

5
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,360
 If you'd like to submit some of your favorite facts, podcast at ki.com, send them there

6
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:32,720
 and he goes through all the mail and he picks out the best choice cuts for us to read out

7
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,720
 on this show.

8
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,000
 So we've all had our facts distributed who wants to open up with one.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 I'll do one.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Let's do it.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 All right.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,520
 This is from Gleb who writes, "Hi, love the show, long suffering, listen to first-time

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,720
 writer Yadda Yadda."

14
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,640
 So we know you do listen.

15
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,640
 Thanks for sticking with it, Gleb.

16
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,640
 It's not easy.

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,160
 It's hard enough doing it.

18
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,720
 Imagine having a listen to all this.

19
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,720
 Listen to all this.

20
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:02,160
 Well, Gleb's fact is this, in the 1930s Pan Am, Pan America, Ellen, were looking for a plane

21
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,600
 that could safely cross the Atlantic with cargo in one trip for their mail service.

22
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,560
 The guy who commissioned the design process was called "Quantrip."

23
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,240
 Is that true?

24
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,240
 Is that true?

25
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,240
 It's actually true.

26
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,240
 Wow.

27
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,240
 It's stunning.

28
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,000
 I went down a real trip wormhole on this.

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,080
 He was a big deal in the world of aviation.

30
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,080
 Yeah.

31
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,280
 He was born in 1899 and he started founding aviation firms.

32
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,840
 He founded Pan Am and he pushed a lot of development of long-range planes because before, you

33
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,040
 know, did you have to stop on the way like in the Azaz or something, or did they just not

34
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,040
 do it?

35
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,040
 I think there was a sort of northern route where you see.

36
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,920
 I had a little hop over to England or Northern Canada.

37
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,920
 Something like that.

38
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,160
 But basically, it was really hard to do.

39
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:53,120
 And in fact, in those days, I read a thing that in the old days, it took eight days to get

40
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,280
 from Miami to Buenos Aires.

41
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,280
 Oh, wow.

42
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,880
 So like, it was just a very, very slow process and he set up all these air bases around the

43
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,920
 world and he conceived this idea of, you know, shortening journeys and--

44
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,920
 Very cool.

45
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,920
 He was a very big deal and his nickname was Mummy because he was so secretive.

46
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,800
 I actually don't think he needed a nickname.

47
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,800
 No.

48
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,800
 "Quantrip."

49
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,800
 You're right.

50
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,560
 I think when you have such a solid name, you should probably rail against any nicknames.

51
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,560
 You're right.

52
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,560
 You're absolutely right.

53
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,280
 He worked for being secretive.

54
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,280
 He kept mum.

55
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,280
 He kept mum.

56
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,280
 That's right.

57
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,280
 Okay.

58
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,280
 He wasn't just wrapped up in--

59
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,280
 No.

60
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,280
 No.

61
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,280
 No.

62
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,280
 No.

63
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,280
 In those little lemon-centered, refreshing tablets that you get on a plane.

64
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,280
 He was wrapped.

65
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,280
 He lived inside those.

66
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,280
 He lived off the plane.

67
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,040
 There's one trip staring back at you.

68
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,040
 Yeah.

69
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,040
 And he was named Juan--

70
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,040
 He wasn't Spanish at all.

71
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,040
 No.

72
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,040
 No.

73
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,040
 He wasn't remote to Spanish.

74
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,040
 No, Hispanic or anything?

75
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,040
 Nope.

76
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,840
 He lived in England and he was from North Europe, his ancestry, you know.

77
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:58,920
 He was named either after his mother's stepfather Juan or his great-uncle Venezuelan wife Juanita

78
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,360
 or his mother's half-sister Juanita sources very quite widely.

79
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,040
 He was named after someone called Juan Juanita.

80
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,040
 It doesn't matter.

81
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,040
 You've never heard of this guy in a minute ago.

82
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,040
 It's not important.

83
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,040
 But I did the research and I had to--

84
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,800
 But it isn't interesting that all those people are quite distantly related from him.

85
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,800
 Yeah.

86
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,800
 Okay.

87
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,800
 You're right, actually.

88
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,520
 And his father-- no, it's always like his great-uncle Venezuelan wife.

89
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,520
 Almost like they put something in that you wouldn't possibly be able to check using the

90
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,520
 normal records.

91
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,520
 Yeah.

92
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,520
 There you go.

93
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,520
 Juan trip.

94
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,520
 That's very good.

95
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,520
 Okay.

96
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,720
 Here is a fact from Bjorn Halga.

97
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,720
 Bjorn writes, "Hi.

98
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,960
 I love your show since you've been continuously delighting me with interesting facts."

99
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,480
 I thought I'd send you an interesting fact myself.

100
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,840
 That's why we're here, Bjorn.

101
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,480
 Juan read a book that said, "A quarter of the iron in the top 20 meters of the ocean is locked

102
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,560
 up in krill."

103
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,560
 Okay.

104
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,560
 Ah.

105
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,920
 It's from a book called The Curious Life of krill, because it sounds like they would know.

106
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,680
 But you know, I didn't think there was that much iron in the ocean anyway.

107
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,680
 No.

108
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,840
 So I was kind of unsure how important it is and I also thought is krill magnetic, if he's

109
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,840
 got so much iron in it, maybe it is.

110
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,240
 Are you thinking fishing-- fishing rod?

111
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,240
 Yeah.

112
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,160
 That would be a really easy way to fish, wouldn't it?

113
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,680
 Just shove a magnet in the water anyway.

114
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,720
 It turns out there was a recent study that looked how much iron is in krill in a place called

115
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:29,720
 Pritz Bay in Antarctica, which I think is named after the DJ Eric Pritz, who made the sun

116
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,040
 call on me in the 2000s.

117
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,040
 That wasn't--

118
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,040
 I was fooled.

119
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,040
 I think about you then.

120
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,520
 I did not even question it as you were saying it.

121
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:46,320
 They found that there's 19 milligrams per kilogram of iron in a krill, which would be extremely weak

122
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,680
 or negligible for practical purposes when it comes to magnetism.

123
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,680
 Right.

124
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,320
 But here is one interesting thing that I did work out.

125
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,680
 A blue whale eats four tons of krill a day.

126
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,480
 So that means if you could take all the iron out of all the krill that a blue whale eats,

127
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,720
 you could get a single table knife worth of iron out of that blue whale every day.

128
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,720
 Wow.

129
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,720
 A beautiful fact.

130
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,720
 Would a blue whale go off in the airport at security?

131
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,720
 No, again, the amount of iron is extremely negligible compared to the weight of the stuff

132
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,720
 that's eating.

133
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,240
 It depends on what the whale does with the iron it eats.

134
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:26,320
 If the iron is all concentrated and it's a special sort of iron gizzard or something.

135
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,720
 Which I don't think the science has proved or disproved yet.

136
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,000
 I'm fairly sure that it pulls it out.

137
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,360
 Okay, so it's not like there's a cutlery drawer inside a whale that steadily gets larger

138
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:42,080
 over it's like life starts developing butter shuffles or whatever, it's Farragans tongs.

139
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,080
 No, okay.

140
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,080
 That's James.

141
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,080
 What a...

142
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,480
 You've taken a little already great facts.

143
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,480
 Yeah.

144
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,480
 And you've improved on it.

145
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,480
 Yeah.

146
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,480
 Well, it was a great fat beyond.

147
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,480
 Thank you very much for writing it.

148
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,480
 Very good fact.

149
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,960
 I've got a fact that's been sent in here.

150
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,840
 It's a bit of a sexy one.

151
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,840
 Oh dear.

152
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,480
 You ready for a sexy one?

153
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,960
 I've been feeling that the way you read it is going to become less sexy.

154
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,960
 Let's see.

155
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,960
 Let's see how many...

156
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,960
 Please do all this agree.

157
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,200
 It's doing a sexy voice.

158
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,520
 I'm doing my sexy dance as well.

159
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,520
 Yeah.

160
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,520
 Here we go.

161
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,760
 Now, so this is from Conan from Singapore.

162
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:19,640
 Just like we think that champagne glasses were modeled after the shape of Marie Antoinette,

163
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,360
 which they are not not true.

164
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,360
 He puts in brackets.

165
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,000
 I'm not the whole shape of her.

166
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 It was supposed to be the coop, which is like their very shallow rounded was supposed

167
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,640
 to be based on her breast.

168
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,640
 Yeah.

169
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,640
 Isn't it?

170
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,640
 Okay.

171
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,640
 So it's not.

172
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,640
 It's not.

173
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,640
 No.

174
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,560
 And what Conan or Conan are saying is that in Hong Kong, what is true is that they sell a

175
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:48,800
 dumpling that is named after the breasts of an actress in Hong Kong called Amy Yip.

176
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:55,440
 And these are dumplings that can weigh up to 350 grams and they even have half full boiled

177
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,720
 eggs inside of them.

178
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,240
 Oh, like with the breasts too, right?

179
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:04,880
 If my biology knowledge is anything to go by, I think that is how it works.

180
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,880
 Yeah.

181
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:10,680
 I actually remember Amy Yip now that I've looked it up because she starred in quite a few

182
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,040
 Chinese movies that were slightly erotic.

183
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:20,120
 And I remember as a kid in the late 90s, seeing a movie come on TV called Erotic Ghost Story

184
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,120
 and watching that.

185
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,120
 Wow.

186
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,120
 And she was.

187
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,960
 You could literally we see where it all comes from originally.

188
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:31,160
 It was really steamy like it was like I was way too young to be watching this movie.

189
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:36,880
 What's interesting is because she was known for largely for how voluptuous she was.

190
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,400
 She never did full nude scenes and movies.

191
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,640
 What they did was they used to do clever camera angles that would show side breasts and so

192
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:47,600
 on that gave you the impression that you think you had and this was known in the industry

193
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:54,020
 because she's called Amy Yip as a Yip tease and they're not full exposure of Amy Yip

194
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,020
 and movies.

195
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,020
 Yeah.

196
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,020
 Well, well.

197
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,020
 And she's really cool.

198
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,020
 Just amazing actress.

199
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,020
 I would be honest then.

200
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:04,700
 I sent it to you because there was a Hong Kong connection and I didn't realise I was giving

201
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,980
 you this prusty and moment.

202
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,740
 Cazapolting you back to your first interest in the paranormal.

203
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,740
 I'm sorry.

204
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,740
 But I'm actually not sorry.

205
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,740
 I'm interested in that happened.

206
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,740
 Yeah.

207
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:18,300
 Like prust nibbled on a battle end and nibbled on a breast shaped dumpling.

208
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,380
 That's a big moment for me.

209
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,380
 Thank you, Andy.

210
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:24,580
 There's a new company in the UK that's just announced they've launched five actual

211
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:28,980
 breast-shaped champagne glasses at they I think they've taken some real women's breasts

212
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:32,940
 and they've they've modeled their glasses on that as a kind of riposte to the French saying

213
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,580
 these glasses actually are based based on on breastsy.

214
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,580
 But I don't know.

215
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,580
 Very nice.

216
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,580
 Okay.

217
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,580
 What's going on the fact of you Andy?

218
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,580
 All right.

219
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,580
 Here's one.

220
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:46,260
 This is from Sandeep Jandu, who's a biology PhD student studying mosquitoes.

221
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,460
 So has sent a fact about ants.

222
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:58,380
 There is an ant which produces offspring of a different species to the ant in the original

223
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,540
 ant.

224
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,540
 It's insane.

225
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,540
 Like a surrogate?

226
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,540
 Kind of.

227
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,540
 You know what?

228
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:07,900
 I read the story quite recently and good luck explaining that.

229
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,900
 Okay.

230
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,900
 I'll give it a go.

231
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:15,380
 Basically, lots of ant queens, they produce workers and a lot of them produce hybrid

232
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:18,780
 workers taking sperm from another species.

233
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,820
 This is called sperm parasitism.

234
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,540
 That's the thing that happens in several species.

235
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:26,700
 But these ants, they're called messo-ibericus, they're incredibly weird.

236
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:34,180
 They do need sperm from another species and the female queen stores sperm from another species

237
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:39,020
 of ant and then she uses that to fertilize her eggs.

238
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:43,300
 But when she lays the eggs, she removes, I don't know if we know how this has done.

239
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:47,840
 She removes her own DNA or her own species DNA from these eggs.

240
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:53,380
 So she has basically made a clone of the other ant species whose sperm she used to make the

241
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,380
 workers, right?

242
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,780
 And that's so weird.

243
00:09:55,780 --> 00:10:00,580
 And basically, she's created a completely separate species to herself.

244
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:03,060
 But here's the really weird thing.

245
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:07,180
 That other species doesn't exist where they live.

246
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,180
 Right.

247
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,060
 So, where did she get the sperm from?

248
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,060
 Wow.

249
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:17,820
 What we think happen is probably they did overlap with that other species, like many moons ago,

250
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:21,980
 but she's been able to continually sort of clone it and clone it and clone it so it doesn't

251
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,980
 matter that the other species don't live there.

252
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,980
 Wow.

253
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:25,980
 That is nuts.

254
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:31,460
 The authors of this study have coined this word Xenoparity, which is like a two species

255
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,460
 organism.

256
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,460
 It's mad.

257
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,940
 The explanation I found by one of the scientists behind it, I think, is that it's the equivalent

258
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:41,480
 of a human having a chimpanzee, like if you were birth to a chimpanzee, but we then use that

259
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:46,260
 chimpanzee to sire a race of human chimpanzee hybrids to do all our housework for us.

260
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,300
 Are they suggesting we do that?

261
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,300
 They're not suggesting we don't do that.

262
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,300
 Wow.

263
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,580
 So thank you, Sam, people.

264
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,580
 Insane.

265
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,580
 That's incredible.

266
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,580
 That's incredible.

267
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,580
 I read something, which is relevant.

268
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,580
 This will become relevant in a second.

269
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,580
 Have you guys heard of Devil's Gardens?

270
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,580
 No.

271
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:05,540
 So this isn't the Amazon Basin and what will happen is people will be walking through and

272
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,340
 suddenly they'll come to a clearing.

273
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:10,720
 It looks like someone's just cleared the area, but there'll just be a few trees that are

274
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,720
 still up.

275
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:18,060
 So, for a long time, locals attributed this to a shape-shifting demon, who they thought

276
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,780
 like to cause misfortune and so on, and you'd walk there and you would get bad things that

277
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,780
 would happen to you.

278
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:26,100
 Turns out when scientists looked into it, it's a type of ant.

279
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:31,580
 It's an ant, which is called the leminent, and it produces a natural formic acid, which

280
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:36,300
 injects into a lot of the plants in the area and kills them off, except for certain plants

281
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:40,820
 that they want to keep, which have hollow roots in them or hollow stems, that the ants

282
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,140
 then nest in.

283
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:45,500
 So it's their whole nesting area, and some of these areas have been lasting for eight hundred

284
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,500
 years or so.

285
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,500
 Wow.

286
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,180
 And yeah, and so for ages, it was a superstition of the area, but it just turns out the leminent

287
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,500
 has been creating these houses in these trees.

288
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,940
 That wasn't suffering enough.

289
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:55,940
 Knock it off ants.

290
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:59,140
 That doesn't mean it's hardly fair to play in the ants.

291
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,140
 No, I'm not.

292
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:03,180
 I'm completely, completely, completely, yeah.

293
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,180
 Yeah.

294
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,180
 Hey, when we get more facts, James?

295
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,500
 Yeah, here's one from Harrison Lee.

296
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:12,060
 Harrison Lee writes that I am currently vacationing in Salzburg, Austria, the birthplace

297
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:17,340
 of Mozart, and learned that Mozart chocolate has nothing to do with Mozart.

298
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:21,780
 The chocolate was invented one hundred years after his death, further than most commonly

299
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:25,620
 sold Mozart chocolates made by a German company, Reba.

300
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:32,300
 Wait, are they suggesting that as well as composing amazing chews, Mozart started a line

301
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,300
 of chocolate?

302
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,700
 I'll be honest, I wasn't massively surprised Harrison by this.

303
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,900
 I didn't think Mozart made these.

304
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,940
 He appears on, I've been there at Salzburg.

305
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:45,580
 He's on the chocolate itself, is that called Mozart Balls?

306
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,580
 Yeah.

307
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,900
 But do you know who invented them first?

308
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,700
 Who invented the Mozart Balls first?

309
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,700
 Eighth Hoven.

310
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,700
 No, no.

311
00:12:53,700 --> 00:13:00,300
 I can't tell you Paul first invented them.

312
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:04,980
 He was a guy, but he was from Salzburg and Ferdinand, but yeah, they're now made by this

313
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:05,980
 German company.

314
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,980
 Right.

315
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,620
 Peter's second must have been absolutely gutted.

316
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:13,300
 Have you guys ever flown out of Salzburg on an airplane?

317
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,300
 I haven't.

318
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,820
 As someone who's a nervous flyer, it's one of the most terrifying runways because the runway

319
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:22,540
 at the end of it is just a giant cliff face.

320
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:26,180
 So if you haven't got the right height, you're just going bang into the cliff face.

321
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:30,260
 As they go along the runway, do the planes go, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh,

322
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,260
 yeah, yeah.

323
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,260
 It's a joke about Beethoven's fifth.

324
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,260
 This is Mozart.

325
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,260
 Well, I'm talking Mozart.

326
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,260
 Please edit that, edit that, edit that.

327
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:44,020
 Beethoven was from Vienna.

328
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,340
 Carry on.

329
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,340
 Yep.

330
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:55,540
 That reminds me of, similarly in Bhutan, in Tim Pu Airport, you come out of the airport

331
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:59,220
 off the runway right in front of you is a cliff.

332
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:03,100
 So you bank left to get out of the cliff, and when you bank left, there's another cliff.

333
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,100
 Oh my god.

334
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,100
 You have to bank right to get out of this.

335
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,180
 You have to do a zigzag to get out.

336
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,260
 Geez, that's why I could arrive in Bhutan, but never leave if I win.

337
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,260
 That is not.

338
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,140
 That and you also would probably marry a Yeti.

339
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,140
 Yes.

340
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,140
 Oh yeah.

341
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,140
 Yes, exactly.

342
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:19,620
 I was sat on that plane, by the way, when we were taking off next to a pilot who was hitching

343
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,620
 a ride.

344
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,620
 And I said to him, he wasn't hitching.

345
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:26,980
 He wasn't just stood on the runway and he stopped out.

346
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,980
 Yeah, he wasn't.

347
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:28,980
 We pulled over.

348
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,580
 I opened the emergency door.

349
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,940
 He was, I said to him, this is crazy.

350
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,340
 You've got a cliff at the end of the runway.

351
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:40,300
 What happens if you, if you go too low, and he just went, don't go too low?

352
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,300
 Yeah.

353
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,620
 Like the cockiness of these guys, but you've got to have it, right?

354
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,700
 So there's a cliff at the end of the, so it's not a cliff edge.

355
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,700
 No, it's a cliff.

356
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,700
 It's a cliff.

357
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,700
 It's a cliff.

358
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,700
 It's a cliff, right?

359
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,700
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

360
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,700
 So the, the, the, the, the, the joke doesn't work for that reason either.

361
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,940
 Well, I don't think we need to spread any more time on that joke.

362
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:56,940
 Let's get to know it.

363
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:57,940
 Stay there.

364
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:58,940
 What joke, you mean?

365
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,940
 [laughs]

366
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,940
 [music]

367
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:01,940
 Why didn't you do the fact?

368
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,940
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

369
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,940
 All right.

370
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,940
 Yeah, yeah.

371
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:05,940
 Yeah, yeah.

372
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:12,460
 So this is from Kerry in Queensland.

373
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:18,140
 And she says, I love Antibody Intrivia on the podcast, and here's one that I found.

374
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:24,860
 In 1873, Bush Ranger Harry Redford was unanimously acquitted of cattle theft only because

375
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,340
 the jury was so impressed by how he managed the feat.

376
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,340
 [laughs]

377
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,340
 That's good.

378
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,340
 Yeah.

379
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,780
 So this is, it's a pretty amazing story.

380
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:38,500
 This guy, this guy Harry Redford, he's, there's, there's Redford Redford, there's different

381
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,500
 spellings of his name.

382
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,700
 Well, Australian listeners don't mind if we mispronounce that.

383
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,700
 We are terrible.

384
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:48,740
 Queensland, Queensland, I'm so nervous about how I said that.

385
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:57,180
 But so basically, he stole the numbers vary from 300 to 1000 cattle, and he knew that he couldn't

386
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:01,180
 sell them locally, so he had to get to another bit of Australia.

387
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:06,980
 He decided to cross 1,500 kilometers worth of Australian desert.

388
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,300
 Was it the Nalaba played?

389
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,100
 Don't do it, don't do it.

390
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:16,860
 This is only 10 years earlier, Birken Will's, who were two explorers, who tried to do the

391
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:21,500
 same feat, died in this process, so they didn't bring a thousand cows to eat.

392
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,500
 Did they?

393
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,500
 Yes.

394
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,500
 The full mistake.

395
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,500
 I'm always bringing a thousand.

396
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,780
 No, so he, he managed this, and so at the trial, the very fact that he'd managed this amazing

397
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:34,100
 feat kind of acquitted him, because they just thought that's too impressive.

398
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,100
 And then it sounds like the...

399
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,980
 It doesn't really feel like that's how it should work.

400
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:38,980
 No.

401
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:42,460
 I think if I munked someone, then I ran away to the North Pole, and I was the first person

402
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,660
 who'd ever done it, with their wallet.

403
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,660
 You know what I mean?

404
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,860
 I think that sort of does take precedence.

405
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,860
 Yeah, I think the judge, because it was up to the jury to the side.

406
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:54,420
 He said, "You're lucky, it wasn't me deciding because the jury were the ones."

407
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:59,100
 And then there's a weird detail that we've been sent by Kerry, which says that his trial

408
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,740
 was delayed for more than a year, because of how long it took to gather the witnesses,

409
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,740
 one of whom was a bull.

410
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,740
 Oh, come on.

411
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:14,860
 It's a call, 999 more bulls.

412
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:18,300
 Yeah, so that's the story of Harry Redford.

413
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,300
 Andy.

414
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,620
 Yeah, I've actually got another Aussie one.

415
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:28,660
 This is from Ari Tune Samanson, and it's that the annual Henley on Todd Regatta in Australia,

416
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:35,940
 was cancelled in 1993, because the river Todd was wet.

417
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:40,180
 There's a river, which is normally dry.

418
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:44,740
 And there's a place, Henley on Todd Regatta happens, it's in Alice Springs.

419
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,740
 Oh yeah.

420
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,740
 Yeah.

421
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:51,140
 Made famous, of course, by Neville Shoes Brilliant Novel, a town like Alice, which is not

422
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:54,220
 actually set in Alice Springs, it's just about a town that's like Alice Springs.

423
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,220
 Anyway.

424
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,220
 Is it?

425
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,220
 Yeah.

426
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:03,220
 It's Dor to Alice, that song by Roy Chubby Brown, that was about someone who lived in the next

427
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,220
 town.

428
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,220
 Yeah.

429
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:12,700
 International listeners, if you don't know who Roy Chubby Brown is, don't look him up.

430
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,740
 What a source to bring in.

431
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,740
 No.

432
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:23,580
 With a gun to my head, I would not have guessed the next name will be Roy Chubby Brown.

433
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:30,420
 My name is Royston Vasey, which is where the legal gentleman fake town is set.

434
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,420
 Yeah.

435
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,420
 It was based in Royston Vasey.

436
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,460
 Roy Chubby Brown's real name is Royston Vasey.

437
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,460
 Yeah.

438
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,460
 Yeah.

439
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,460
 Good trivia.

440
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,460
 Great trivia.

441
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,460
 We can always pull it back, aren't we?

442
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,460
 Absolutely.

443
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,460
 Anyway.

444
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,740
 But this is the world's only dry riverboating event.

445
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:47,660
 People make boats and then they run along with them like the Flintstones.

446
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:52,980
 In the dry riverbed, that's been going on for, I think about 60 years now, but in 1993 there

447
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,980
 was flooding.

448
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,980
 And I had to be cancelled because the railing was wet.

449
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:56,980
 Yes, it was.

450
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:57,980
 Great.

451
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,980
 Okay.

452
00:18:58,980 --> 00:18:59,980
 Here's the last one from me by Dave Rool.

453
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:03,400
 Dave Rool writes, "Long time less than a first-time call, I thought you might appreciate this

454
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,780
 list of things unexpectedly named after people.

455
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:10,060
 I had heard most of these, but definitely not all of them."

456
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:15,360
 So, Google's page rank, which is the tool for ranking web pages, is named after Larry

457
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,360
 Page.

458
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,360
 Okay.

459
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,360
 Yeah.

460
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:24,240
 Street San Francisco is named after Charles Mayne.

461
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:30,600
 Snowflake Arizona is named after two people, Mr. Snow and Mr. Flake, and Taco Bell is named

462
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,600
 after a guy called Glen Bell.

463
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,600
 Wow.

464
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,600
 That's good.

465
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,600
 That's really good.

466
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,600
 Snowflake is amazing.

467
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:42,880
 So, I looked into my files for some more sort of weirdly named things.

468
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:48,240
 The insult dum-dum, like if you call someone a dum-dum, that's named after a town and

469
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,240
 India.

470
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,240
 Oh, is it?

471
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,240
 Right.

472
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,240
 Yeah.

473
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,200
 Because you think it's because someone's dumb, but actually there's like a bun on that, because

474
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:58,700
 dum-dums were a type of bullet, and these bullets were first made in the town called

475
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,160
 Dum-Dum, near Kolkata.

476
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:09,160
 German chocolate cake is named after someone called Samuel German.

477
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,880
 And that was, it was invented in the US.

478
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:20,440
 And the Indonesian football team called Seaman Padang is named after a local cement company

479
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,680
 called Seaman Cement.

480
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,680
 Oh, wow.

481
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,680
 Wow.

482
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,680
 That's going to say David Seaman, the goalie, but...

483
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,440
 Yes, that would have been good.

484
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,440
 Seaman Cement.

485
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,440
 Yeah.

486
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,440
 That's great.

487
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,040
 You can bake your own jokes up for that one.

488
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,040
 Absolutely.

489
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,040
 Well, brilliant.

490
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,520
 Thank you, everyone, for sending in your facts.

491
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:42,000
 We're going to be doing this every Monday, but before we wrap up today, we have a very

492
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,240
 important job to do, which is that members of the highest level of club fish, known as

493
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:52,640
 Friends of the Podcasts, all as a reward for joining us at that highest bit, get given

494
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:58,160
 custodianship over one of the facts that we have done over the past 11 years of fish episodes,

495
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:02,320
 and so we are now going to dish out some more facts to some of those people.

496
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,720
 So, Andy, let's start with you.

497
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,720
 Yeah, I got one.

498
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,480
 This goes out to Stu Rottenbury.

499
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,480
 Congratulations, Stu.

500
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,040
 Your fact is one of my old facts.

501
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,040
 It's that.

502
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:20,360
 Tori and Prime Minister both started out as insults and you could say, "These still

503
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,360
 are, actually."

504
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,360
 Oh, wow.

505
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,360
 Yeah.

506
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,360
 Yeah.

507
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,720
 Well, the kind of satire over there.

508
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,720
 Yeah.

509
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,240
 I think Tori is a kind of Irish raider.

510
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,240
 Yeah, that's right.

511
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,800
 He was a kind of bandit who operated in Ireland.

512
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,600
 And I think Prime Minister was the idea that you were taking the piss that this person thinks

513
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,000
 they're in charge when actually they're ahead of us.

514
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 A larger group of people.

515
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 You think you're great.

516
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 That's it.

517
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 Exactly that.

518
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 Yeah.

519
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 Okay.

520
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 Well, here is one.

521
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 This was originally by Anna.

522
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,120
 And it's now under the custodianship of another Anna, Anna Dalin.

523
00:21:54,120 --> 00:22:00,680
 And Anna says that in a 2005 questionnaire about substance abuse, one in five admitted to

524
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,880
 taking a drug, which doesn't exist.

525
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,080
 Can anyone remember the name of the drug?

526
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,600
 I think it was called Derbysol.

527
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,600
 Derbysol?

528
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,600
 Yeah.

529
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,600
 Wow.

530
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,600
 Wow.

531
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,600
 That's right.

532
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,600
 This is episode 11.

533
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,600
 Yeah, I can't remember anything from episode 12 to 600.

534
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,600
 But yeah.

535
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,600
 Yeah.

536
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,600
 Derbysol, that's right.

537
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,600
 That's right.

538
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,400
 So it was just basically they put in the load of drugs.

539
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,400
 Have you taken them?

540
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,400
 And they put in this one that didn't exist just to catch people out who were like.

541
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,400
 Lovely.

542
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,400
 Brilliant.

543
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,400
 Okay.

544
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,400
 Well, let's do another one.

545
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,400
 This one goes to a group of people.

546
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,400
 Team Charnady.

547
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,400
 Team Charnady.

548
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,400
 What do you think?

549
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,000
 What's that pronunciation?

550
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Charnady.

551
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 It could be that this person's first name is Team.

552
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 That's true.

553
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 That's true.

554
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 Or it could be Team Charlotte and Eddie, Charnady.

555
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 Yes.

556
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 Oh, like maybe it's Charles and Eddie.

557
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 They've synced us from the 1990s.

558
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 Or Prince Charles.

559
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 Oh!

560
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 Would I like them?

561
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 Would I lie to you, baby?

562
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 Would I lie to you?

563
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 Oh, my James.

564
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 Yes.

565
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 You're throwing in a lot of references that have even got rid of me as an understanding.

566
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 Well, this is...

567
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,480
 It could be Prince Charles and Prince Edward, of course.

568
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,480
 Either way, it's suddenly a celeb pack show.

569
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,480
 This is very exciting.

570
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,480
 Your Highnesses and excellent musicians.

571
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,480
 Thank you for listening.

572
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:22,480
 And you now are the custodians of a fact that I said in episode 11,

573
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:27,480
 which is that sea otters have a secret pocket that they like to keep their stones in.

574
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,480
 Very good.

575
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,480
 It's a special secret pocket.

576
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,480
 It's a secret pocket.

577
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,480
 Much like the royal family have their own jewels.

578
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,480
 Yes.

579
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,480
 Brilliant.

580
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,480
 They keep in a secret tower in the little family.

581
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,480
 Exactly.

582
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,480
 Yes.

583
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,480
 And they're in secrets, which we don't need to get into.

584
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,480
 We don't.

585
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,480
 Not while they're listening, anyway.

586
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,480
 But yeah, so thank you very much to team.

587
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,480
 Absolutely.

588
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,480
 Okay.

589
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,480
 Why don't we get one from you, Andy?

590
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,480
 All right.

591
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:57,480
 This fact goes out to Dries Belinks.

592
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:02,480
 And it's that knobs have been made illegal in Vancouver.

593
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,480
 I'm referring to calls to door knobs.

594
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,480
 This was the James fact.

595
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,480
 It's absolutely straight on brand for me, isn't it?

596
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,480
 Yes.

597
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,480
 Make it sound a bit more rude than it actually is.

598
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,480
 I think this was an early day classic.

599
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:19,480
 And I've said this a few times about the early day classics of no such thing as a fish.

600
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:24,480
 But the reason I say it is for this one is, do you remember in the very early days of fish,

601
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,480
 we produce some business cards.

602
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,480
 So when we started out, we handed out business cards to people saying we've got this new podcast.

603
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,480
 And on the back of it, it had a fact from each one of us.

604
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,480
 And that was your fact, James, for your business card.

605
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,480
 Very few podcasts, I think, now have business cards.

606
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,480
 And I think that was a shame.

607
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,480
 Well, yeah.

608
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,480
 Because look what it did for us.

609
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,480
 Yeah.

610
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,480
 Here we are 11 years later.

611
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,480
 Oh, no, absolutely.

612
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:49,480
 But the off menu boys, I don't think you're carrying around a stack of cards with the fact about food on them.

613
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,480
 And that's why who?

614
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,480
 Couldn't agree more.

615
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,480
 All right.

616
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,480
 Well, okay.

617
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,480
 Next fact.

618
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,480
 I just want to say that I really like off menu and those guys, if they want to come on our podcast,

619
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,480
 I would be more than welcome.

620
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,480
 That's a good point.

621
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,480
 Okay.

622
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,480
 Let's get to another fact here.

623
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,480
 So we have episode 12.

624
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,480
 We're now going into James.

625
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,480
 Why don't you give us this one?

626
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,480
 Okay.

627
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,480
 I can tell you mine from episode 12.

628
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,480
 It was the first fact in that episode.

629
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:19,480
 And it was that if the new Godzilla, which is very much now the old Godzilla,

630
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:25,480
 if the new Godzilla existed, it would produce 12.9 million gallons of urine a day.

631
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:29,480
 And that fact is now under the custodian ship of Douglas Owen.

632
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,480
 So congratulations to you, Douglas.

633
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,480
 Very, very nice.

634
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,480
 Brilliant fact.

635
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,480
 So I guess there must have been a new Godzilla film out.

636
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,480
 Right.

637
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:42,480
 I think it was made by Garret Edwards, who you and I had on the museum of curiosity.

638
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,480
 So we knew Garret, we had a few nights out with him.

639
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,480
 I saw it in the cinema.

640
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,480
 Yeah.

641
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,480
 There's a very exciting bit.

642
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,480
 Spoiler alert.

643
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,480
 Sorry.

644
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,480
 Yeah.

645
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,480
 What's the exciting bit?

646
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,480
 It's just a bit where some people are trying to parachute down.

647
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,480
 I believe on to Godzilla.

648
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,480
 It's an exciting moment.

649
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,480
 It's been a while since I've seen the film, because this was 11 years ago.

650
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,480
 Yeah.

651
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,480
 Yeah.

652
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,480
 12.9 million gallons a day.

653
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,480
 Makes you think.

654
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,480
 How many gallons are there in it say an Olympic swimming pool?

655
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,480
 660,000 gallons.

656
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,480
 So that's.

657
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,480
 No, so that's 20 Olympic swimming pools of urine a day.

658
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,480
 Hmm.

659
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,480
 And that's going to.

660
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,480
 Oh, it's going to ruin those Olympics, isn't it?

661
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,480
 Right.

662
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,480
 Let's get a few more.

663
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,480
 Andy, do you want to read the next one?

664
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,480
 This is a fact that goes out to Stephen Armstrong Worthington.

665
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,480
 Congratulations to you, Stephen.

666
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,480
 It's a great fact.

667
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,480
 It's that.

668
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,480
 I love this fact.

669
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:39,480
 The real Long John Silver from Treasure Island was farther to the real Wendy from Peter Pan.

670
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,480
 What?

671
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,480
 I know.

672
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,480
 I know.

673
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,480
 Do we really know who the real Long John Silver was?

674
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:51,480
 Well, he was inspired by William Henley, who was a writer and an athlete.

675
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:55,480
 And he also started that regatta in Australia.

676
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,480
 Yeah.

677
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,480
 Yeah.

678
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,480
 Yeah, amazing guy.

679
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,480
 He wrote this poem Invictus.

680
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,480
 It was all about being unconquered and it's all about being a, you know, knowing, being captain of your soul.

681
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,480
 It's quite a stirring stuff.

682
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,480
 And so he clearly, um, and he had a daughter who was called Margaret Henley.

683
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:15,480
 And that inspired Jerem Barry to choose the name Wendy for Peter Pan.

684
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,480
 Oh, okay.

685
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,480
 Yeah, because she was his Flandy Wendy.

686
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,480
 That's it.

687
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,480
 Very nice.

688
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,480
 Yeah.

689
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,480
 So anyway, I love that fact.

690
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,480
 There you go.

691
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,480
 Congratulations, Stephen.

692
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,480
 Okay.

693
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,480
 Let's go another one.

694
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,480
 This was my fact from episode 12, and this is going to shorn Donoway.

695
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:37,480
 The fact is that tinfoil hats, worn by conspiracy theorists, would actually amplify the signal.

696
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,480
 Very good.

697
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,480
 Brilliant.

698
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:45,480
 So the idea, if you don't know it, is that people believe that if you wear tinfoil hats, it's going to stop the government from getting into your brain,

699
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,480
 getting signals out of there.

700
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,480
 So it's an anti-stealing ideas device.

701
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:56,480
 And then some scientists did a test on it, and they worked out that if anything,

702
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,480
 it would amplify a signal rather than decrease it.

703
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,480
 And that's why you wear the anti-fifety bracelet, isn't it, then?

704
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,480
 Because that's been proven to work under lab conditions.

705
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,480
 And they work with proof.

706
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,480
 Yeah.

707
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,480
 There you go, shorn Donoway.

708
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,480
 It's a great story, great study.

709
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,480
 Shall we do one more?

710
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,480
 Let's do one more.

711
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:22,480
 The fact that now belongs to Shona McLean, that geese sometimes fly upside down to lose heights quickly when coming into land,

712
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,480
 but their head and neck stay the right way up.

713
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,480
 And this is called whiffling.

714
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,480
 It's got Murray all over it, that fact.

715
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,480
 I love this fact.

716
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,480
 He loves a whiffle.

717
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,480
 This is probably the fact if someone asked me for a fact.

718
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,480
 It's one of the top two or three that occurred to me to say to someone.

719
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,480
 Is it?

720
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:43,480
 Yeah, there's one inappropriate one, which I can't remember, oh, it's about kangaroos and they're intimate parts.

721
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:47,480
 And then this fact is the one I say when I've got rid of that fact from my head.

722
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,480
 And it gives you a geese fly upside down.

723
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,480
 And if you've never seen a photo of a goose whiffling, it's amazing.

724
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,480
 You got to Google it.

725
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,480
 Very cool.

726
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,480
 Because they look so silly.

727
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,480
 Yeah, it is incredible.

728
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,480
 Well, there we go.

729
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,480
 We've dished out eight new custodians facts for this episode.

730
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,480
 Congratulations to you all.

731
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,480
 Hope you're happy with the facts that you got.

732
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:08,480
 If you would like to get one of your own facts, well, all you need to do is go to patreon.com.

733
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,480
 Slash, no such thing as a fish.

734
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:15,480
 And if you join the friend of the podcast here, you automatically will be issued one.

735
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:19,480
 And then we will read it out at some point on one of these episodes.

736
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:23,480
 Otherwise, if you want to send a fact in for little fish podcast at qi.com.

737
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,480
 And he goes through it all as I said at the top.

738
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:30,480
 And he'll pick some more for next week's episodes to get hunting and send them in.

739
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,480
 All right, everyone.

740
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,480
 We'll see you again next week.

741
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,480
 And we'll also see you on Friday for the main no such thing as a fish episode.

742
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:45,480
 And until then, goodbye.

743
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,540
 (upbeat music)

744
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:57,540
