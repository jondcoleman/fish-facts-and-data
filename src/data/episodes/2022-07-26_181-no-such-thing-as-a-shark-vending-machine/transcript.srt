1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
 - Hey guys, welcome to this week's episode

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,760
 and no such thing as a fish.

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,960
 Before we begin, we have an announcement to make.

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,000
 - What's the announcement then?

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,440
 - The announcement is that we're doing a live show.

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,280
 - Get out of here.

7
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,400
 - Yeah, at a book festival.

8
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,240
 - No.

9
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,560
 - Yeah, Cheltenham Book Festival, we're so excited.

10
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,080
 It is in Cheltenham.

11
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,480
 - It's in Cheltenham, nice.

12
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,040
 - It's on the 11th of October, it's at 6 p.m.

13
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,920
 We're doing it because we're releasing our book in November

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,040
 and this is gonna be the first ever event

15
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,840
 where we bring our book to.

16
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,200
 We're not gonna have the physical book with us,

17
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,040
 it's not publish yet.

18
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,600
 - We're gonna have our heads because we've written it,

19
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,440
 we know it.

20
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,280
 - Exactly.

21
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,160
 - So the whole event is gonna be a live podcast,

22
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,800
 we're gonna take our facts from the upcoming book

23
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,800
 and we're gonna do a Q and A afterwards

24
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,640
 and it's gonna be awesome, it's a legit book festival.

25
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,720
 - It'll be really fun if you've never been to our live shows.

26
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,760
 So go to qi.com/fishevents to get tickets for that

27
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,960
 or you can just look on the Cheltenham Festival website,

28
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,040
 11th of October.

29
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,960
 - So I get a qi.com/fishevents.

30
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,800
 - That's correct.

31
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,640
 - That's correct.

32
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,480
 - Yeah.

33
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,320
 - Do you write that down?

34
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,160
 - Do you write that down?

35
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,000
 - Do you write that down?

36
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,160
 - How do you spell qi?

37
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,040
 - Okay, on with this week's show.

38
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,480
 (upbeat music)

39
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,280
 (speaking in foreign language)

40
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:22,440
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

41
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,160
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

42
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,880
 coming to you from the QI offices

43
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,280
 in Covenant Garden.

44
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,440
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here

45
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,160
 with Andrew Hunter-Mari, Anacizansky, and Alex Bell.

46
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,520
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

47
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,480
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

48
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,240
 and in no particular order, here we go.

49
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,120
 Starting with you, Andy.

50
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,600
 - My fact is that the original director of "Jaws"

51
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,360
 was a man called Richard Richards who was fired

52
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,400
 because he kept referring to the shark as a whale.

53
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,200
 (laughing)

54
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,760
 - So he did not read the script?

55
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,600
 - I don't know if he had read it or not,

56
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,080
 but he had, he definitely had.

57
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,240
 (laughing)

58
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,880
 He had because when you say he kept referring to it,

59
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,920
 it wasn't even like loosely in conversation.

60
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,160
 He was in a meeting with the producers.

61
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,600
 He'd ridden a treatment where all the way through

62
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,680
 the treatment, he kept saying, "And then the whale."

63
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,960
 (laughing)

64
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,840
 - Yeah, the producers have got the rights

65
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,560
 to turn the novel "Jaws" into the film

66
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,760
 and they took him for lunch and they decided to let him go.

67
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,240
 - And then they gave it to Spielberg.

68
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,440
 - That's right, yeah.

69
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,440
 - Here's a classic bit of trivia

70
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,160
 that I bet everyone who knows "Jaws" knows.

71
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,360
 But again, I didn't know that this shark has a name.

72
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,360
 - Oh yeah. - I am.

73
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,120
 - Not in the movie, just on set.

74
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,200
 (laughing)

75
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,960
 So like we know on the back of his seat.

76
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,160
 (laughing)

77
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,160
 - Actors and directors, which was Bruce.

78
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,120
 - Wasn't he named after Steven Spielberg Gloya?

79
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,960
 - That's right, yeah.

80
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,200
 He was named after his lawyer who was called Bruce Raynor

81
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,360
 and Bruce became the name of the shark on the set.

82
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,840
 - Bruce is quite a good name though, isn't it, for a shark?

83
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,680
 There's something about it.

84
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,560
 I know it's an Australian sounding name.

85
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,880
 I think a shark's being Australian.

86
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,880
 - It's the name, you know how you're making that connection.

87
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,760
 It's the name of the shark and finding Nemo.

88
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,680
 - Oh.

89
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,760
 - That must be a nod to that.

90
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,200
 - It must be, absolutely.

91
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,480
 - Well, it's a good thing they didn't give it

92
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,880
 the other nickname that it had on set,

93
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,440
 which was the great white turd.

94
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,280
 - Yeah.

95
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,480
 - And also flaws, because they were never worked.

96
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,320
 - Yeah, which I like.

97
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,880
 - Spielberg basically rewrote the movie a bit

98
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,080
 because they couldn't get the shark to work.

99
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,320
 It was such a bad mechanical shark.

100
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,960
 Which is, I mean, you know, if you're filming

101
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,480
 anything mechanical in saltwater, it's gonna be difficult.

102
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,320
 - Yeah.

103
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,280
 - So they made three mechanical sharks

104
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,960
 so that they could film it from different angles

105
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,080
 with different bits.

106
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,720
 There had to be 16 people on a nearby floating barge

107
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,640
 operating different bits of the shark.

108
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,640
 - 'Cause the whole thing was pneumatic.

109
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,040
 They had loads of nodes of piped operate

110
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,600
 because they had motors which all broke.

111
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,440
 So they had to put pneumatic tubes in to make it work,

112
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,240
 which meant they had to have a huge, like,

113
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,800
 operating station which was quite off-scaling.

114
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,640
 - I know.

115
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,320
 - So they compared it to an orchestra in an article I read.

116
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,360
 So they all had to be doing the right things.

117
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,040
 All 16 people at the right time.

118
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,360
 So it all works properly.

119
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,680
 And sometimes there would be a bit where 15 people

120
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,640
 got a right and the shark comes out of the water

121
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,480
 as you're filming.

122
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,720
 But then it's mechanical eyes are shut.

123
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,560
 - Oh, yeah.

124
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,440
 - So then you have to go back and do it again.

125
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,280
 And then something else won't be working right

126
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,600
 or one of the fins will be whacking me.

127
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,680
 - Are they given it mechanical eyelids?

128
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,160
 (laughing)

129
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,280
 - It was the eyelids.

130
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,720
 - It is George, ever blink.

131
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,880
 We need to rewatch that film.

132
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,080
 - It's not a classic moment.

133
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,000
 There's no one I wink that he give to the camera

134
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,240
 just before he eats some of it.

135
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,040
 - They wanted, actually, the producers asked Spielberg

136
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,280
 to train a great white shark initially for the film, yeah.

137
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,120
 - That is so hollywood.

138
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,960
 - Yeah.

139
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,720
 (laughing)

140
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,120
 - Turns out you can't do that.

141
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,960
 (laughing)

142
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,120
 - That is amazing.

143
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,200
 - He moved on to this.

144
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,600
 Did you know that for some of the shots

145
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,000
 in order to make the shark look bigger,

146
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,640
 they used a body double for the guy who placed

147
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,640
 the main character.

148
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,160
 And they used a jockey, 'cause he was really small.

149
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,320
 So they used a 4 foot 9x jockey to be in a in the shark tank

150
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,840
 just to make it look that bit bigger.

151
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,160
 - That's a bit like I know all these films

152
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,000
 like in Casablanca.

153
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,960
 They had small people wandering around

154
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,800
 the cutout of the plane in that famous last scene

155
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,200
 in the background, 'cause it makes the plane look bigger,

156
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,840
 so they had to have a bigger cutout.

157
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,680
 It was like that.

158
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,200
 All sorts of like, perspective, gags like that.

159
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,600
 - Did you know one of the main problems with jaws,

160
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,320
 the mechanical one?

161
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,600
 It's the jaws.

162
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,320
 The jaws are not right in the jaws of the thing.

163
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,120
 They're not right for a shark or they just wouldn't work.

164
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,240
 - They're not right for a shark.

165
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,440
 I'm sure they wouldn't work at various points,

166
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,920
 but this is really interesting.

167
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,960
 Think great white sharks have a much weaker bite

168
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,680
 than you might suspect.

169
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,240
 They're not weak.

170
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,920
 No one's saying they're weak,

171
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,560
 but their jaws aren't attached to their head properly.

172
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,120
 So they operate with a separate muscle.

173
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,000
 And what that means is what they can do

174
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,120
 is approach you in the water

175
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,280
 and give you a test bite, which is soft.

176
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,760
 And then if they like the taste of you

177
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,880
 and they think you'd be good,

178
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,600
 they come back for a kill bite.

179
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,200
 So loads of people who have had a time

180
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,680
 with a great white shark and escaped

181
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,000
 have probably been given a test bite,

182
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,600
 which is still serious and you can still bleed to death,

183
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,720
 obviously, but they haven't been given the full kill bite.

184
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,720
 - I do that with food.

185
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,920
 - It's really weird, I like it.

186
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,280
 (all laughing)

187
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,960
 - It's not kind of a restaurant with you.

188
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,680
 (all laughing)

189
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,760
 'Cause then you walk off around the restaurant

190
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,000
 once you're given a test bite.

191
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,840
 (all laughing)

192
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,720
 But the jaws obviously on the mechanical shark,

193
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,240
 they don't have those two gradations.

194
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,800
 So it's just a massive hinge and it's just not shithaway.

195
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,960
 - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

196
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,560
 - So why do they do the test bite?

197
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,000
 Why don't they just go in with the big bites

198
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 to say the energy or something?

199
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,600
 - Well, they might not like what they eat, you know?

200
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,000
 They might find, oh, it's all full of bone.

201
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,040
 I don't want to eat the bone.

202
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,160
 They might say, oh, go off and find a seal to eat and stay

203
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,440
 'cause they're all blubber and delicious.

204
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,600
 - I guess when you've got a mouth out big,

205
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,280
 you're kind of committing when you're biting something,

206
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,600
 you've got to do something with it.

207
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,080
 - What if there's a tree floating in the water

208
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,920
 and you make a mistake?

209
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,680
 If you go in for a massive kill bite,

210
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,240
 you'll feel like an idiot. - Yeah, whereas if you give it a quick test,

211
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,200
 no, that's a tree, I knew it was a tree.

212
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,360
 - So here's something interesting.

213
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,680
 When they first put the shark into salt water, it sank.

214
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,760
 So when they were going to film,

215
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,720
 and they had to retrieve it from the bottom of Martha's Vineyard,

216
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,520
 and it's because it was salt water

217
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,040
 and they don't ever attest it is in freshwater,

218
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,760
 which they were expecting that it was going to work

219
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,920
 like it did in freshwater, but then it sank to the bottom,

220
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,320
 which is the exact opposite of how a real shark would work.

221
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,360
 And do you remember I mentioned this a few episodes

222
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,200
 go on the podcast, they don't have a swim bladder,

223
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,200
 and so they don't often go into freshwater

224
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,880
 because it doesn't work there, so they'll sink in freshwater.

225
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,920
 - But I don't understand, so obviously salty water is more buoyant,

226
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,360
 and so I don't understand what would sink

227
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,760
 in salt water that wouldn't sink in freshwater.

228
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,600
 - No one does.

229
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,880
 - I don't think this is one of those universal mysteries.

230
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,520
 (laughing)

231
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,520
 - No one does, but which I mean, I don't know.

232
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,280
 (laughing)

233
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,080
 - I've got something so bizarre that I found out.

234
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:41,920
 - Yeah.

235
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,040
 - Of course of this, which is that it is related,

236
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,920
 but you're not going to get know why initially.

237
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:50,720
 So polygraph tests are sold very often across the US,

238
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,800
 like you can sell your polygraph testing services

239
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,160
 for various reasons, and all the websites

240
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,520
 that advertise polygraph tests say you can use these four,

241
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,560
 and then there's list of the main things you use them for.

242
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,280
 So for theft, arson, murder, robbery, infidelity, assault,

243
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,080
 and fishing tournaments, and it turns out,

244
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,000
 so I learned this looking at these sharp catching tournaments,

245
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,200
 and the idea is that you go,

246
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,520
 and you have to catch the biggest shark that you possibly can,

247
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,320
 and one of the main uses of polygraph tests

248
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,080
 is having lie detector tests after these tournaments

249
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,720
 to check the people haven't cheated.

250
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,560
 - No.

251
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,880
 - Yeah, this is what, and it's on all these lie detector websites,

252
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,760
 they're like, yeah, murder, arson, cheating wives,

253
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,040
 fishing tournament, obviously.

254
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,080
 - Cheating the shark as you can.

255
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,080
 - Because.

256
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,720
 - No, what you do is there are shark sales people

257
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,400
 who collect large sharks around the year

258
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,240
 and keep them alive,

259
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,360
 and then they flog them to people who've entered the tournaments

260
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,480
 on the slide, so you go buy a shark.

261
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,520
 - So you go live at the tour of it with a giant shark

262
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:51,040
 in your bag, get on a boat and let the slowly lower it

263
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,040
 on your jacket.

264
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,880
 (laughing)

265
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,360
 - That's why bag searches originally come from sharks.

266
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,200
 - Right.

267
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,560
 - The guy, who's the guy here at the original book,

268
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,400
 he really regressed it.

269
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,240
 - Bentley.

270
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,080
 - Bentley.

271
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,800
 - Yeah, so Peter Bentley regretted the fact

272
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,400
 that sharks have vilified via jaws,

273
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,800
 and suddenly it's set off this spate of shark hunting

274
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,960
 and shark murdering expeditions,

275
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,560
 and shark populations in America were reduced by it

276
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,800
 up to 50% some people say,

277
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,800
 not just because of shark hunting,

278
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,920
 but that was a huge thing and it still happens today,

279
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,320
 these shark hunting tournaments,

280
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,640
 caused by the fact that it created this bad reputation

281
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,560
 for sharks who obviously only kill about one person

282
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,480
 every two years,

283
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,240
 whereas we kill hundreds of thousands of them every year.

284
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,200
 - I think it's something like a hundred million sharks

285
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,840
 per year that once kill.

286
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,680
 - What?

287
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,520
 - Yeah, it's huge.

288
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,600
 - It's a massive number.

289
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,800
 - This is about great fact about how

290
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,080
 vending machines kill twice as many humans as sharks do.

291
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,920
 - Yeah.

292
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,760
 - Mm.

293
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,760
 - But if we had a shark in the corridor at the school,

294
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,600
 I think the figures might start creeping up.

295
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,440
 (laughing)

296
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,600
 - If you could only get a twix by reaching

297
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,800
 into the mouth of a shark.

298
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,120
 (laughing)

299
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,700
 (upbeat music)

300
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:03,080
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two,

301
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,880
 and that is Alex.

302
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,520
 My fact this week is that until the 1960s,

303
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,160
 high speed trains in Britain would drop carriages

304
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,200
 off at stations that they weren't stopping at.

305
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,520
 - So your train is going along?

306
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,360
 - Yeah.

307
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,720
 - And then all the people in the back

308
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,640
 carriage wanted to get off at the next stop,

309
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,640
 but the train's not stopping.

310
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,560
 - There's a high speed train, yeah.

311
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,680
 - It's a high speed train.

312
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,520
 So you have to run into the back carriage

313
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,200
 and then they just cut it off.

314
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,720
 - Yeah, I don't think everyone would,

315
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,600
 I think I would get in and sit at the back carriage

316
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,160
 but you wouldn't just like run and jump

317
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,040
 as the carriage is not leaving the train.

318
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,400
 But they would uncouple the trainers,

319
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,720
 they were approaching the station,

320
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,960
 and there would be a guard in that carriage with a brake,

321
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,720
 and then the carriage would just roll to a stop at station

322
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,120
 which meant that anyone who wanted to get off

323
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,960
 at that station could,

324
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,080
 but it wouldn't slow down the train.

325
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,240
 So what would they do with then the carriage?

326
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,080
 Oh, this is the clever bit

327
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,600
 because the carriages would then be picked up

328
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,440
 by the next slow train that was coming through.

329
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,160
 So the slow trains would actually get carriages added on.

330
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,720
 - Why is it only high speed trains?

331
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,560
 It seems like they're the most difficult trains

332
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,840
 to accurately drop of a carriage at a station.

333
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,600
 - I don't think the high speed trains are going faster

334
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,840
 than the actual trains.

335
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,360
 - It's high speed is in express trains,

336
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,680
 they're not stopping at the station.

337
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,840
 That's what's excellent when you stop at every station.

338
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,160
 - So when do they stop doing this?

339
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,680
 - Well, they did it for like 40, 50 years

340
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,600
 and then finished in the 1960s.

341
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,720
 And now the replacement service is when you get on a train

342
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,200
 and it splits in two parts,

343
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,640
 when you get to a certain station.

344
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,480
 - So that's what it looks like.

345
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,320
 - That's so cool.

346
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,000
 So like in theory our grandparents should remember that.

347
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,840
 - Yeah, if they lived in England, you know,

348
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,080
 they might have been on one of the jettisoned.

349
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,800
 - It was a pretty common thing. - Trains, wow.

350
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,880
 - Another thing you could do until the 1970s,

351
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,000
 so this is from 1889 to the 1970s,

352
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,240
 anyone on the train could cause the train to break.

353
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,560
 And this still happens in trains around the world,

354
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,800
 quite a bit. - Yeah.

355
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,640
 - But now I think the driver has an override button.

356
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,640
 So, but I didn't realize this,

357
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,120
 there was a cord that ran all the way from,

358
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,440
 you know, where the driver's sitting

359
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,520
 and where the brakes are,

360
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,800
 all the way along the roof to the back of the train

361
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,280
 and a little cord drops down each carriage and you pull it.

362
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,280
 But what you have now is you pull the cord

363
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,160
 and the driver has three seconds to decide

364
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,800
 whether to override it.

365
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,320
 So if the driver sees the cord's been pulled,

366
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,640
 he's got three seconds to make a crucial decision of,

367
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,320
 is it worth stopping for this emergency?

368
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,040
 I don't know what this emergency is probably

369
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,160
 'cause a passenger's done it and I can't see it.

370
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,160
 - Yeah, but what kind of information can he get

371
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,000
 in those three seconds? - Yeah.

372
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,240
 - How does that help? - Well, exactly.

373
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,480
 I don't know. - Maybe he's running late.

374
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,640
 And he thinks it can't be that bad.

375
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,680
 - But maybe things were coming into a station in a minute.

376
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,680
 So let's speed it better. - Yeah, that's true.

377
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,680
 - Maybe that's it.

378
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,040
 - He has got a communication line

379
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,600
 with the passengers pulled the cord as well.

380
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,480
 So he can't just shout, "Wink, wink, wink, wink."

381
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,680
 What's going on? What's going on?

382
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,920
 You wouldn't have time.

383
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,080
 Three seconds is all enough. - No, look at that.

384
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:36,920
 - I don't know. - I don't know.

385
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,120
 Most of my conversations with my father

386
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,200
 are about three seconds, and we say everything we need to.

387
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,960
 (laughing)

388
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,520
 Yeah, I was on a train to Edinburgh not too long ago

389
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,600
 and in the bathroom, just above the toilet,

390
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,240
 there was a big red button that said stop.

391
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,240
 - We're in the bathroom, wasn't it?

392
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,080
 - There's in the toilet.

393
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,920
 - I couldn't believe it. - I couldn't believe it.

394
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,760
 - I couldn't believe it. - I didn't go down.

395
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,600
 I could just stop the train.

396
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,640
 It was a train stop button in the toilet.

397
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,120
 - It's interesting you raised the toilet thing

398
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,120
 because there's a blog by someone who works in railways

399
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,480
 who says that this is a serious problem

400
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,400
 with the emergency button because it is

401
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,840
 in the accessible toilets.

402
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,920
 And people often pull it thinking it's the flush.

403
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,760
 - Yes.

404
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,120
 - If you're an older person, you're a bit confused

405
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,920
 or a bit drunk, then it often gets pulled to flush the loo

406
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,080
 and then you've breaks the train.

407
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,600
 - Okay, so one in 10 train characters in the UK

408
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:21,160
 still jettison's toilet waste onto the track

409
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,000
 or the flush. - Do they?

410
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,840
 - One in 10.

411
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,840
 This was in 2015.

412
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,560
 So they are trying to replace them all by 2020,

413
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,280
 but it's still quite a large number.

414
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,120
 - Yeah.

415
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,120
 - And that's why they're assigned saying don't flush.

416
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:31,960
 - At station.

417
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,760
 - At stations, but it's pretty medieval.

418
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,920
 - It's pretty medieval.

419
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,280
 Well, there was a massive report in Wales online recently

420
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,880
 in which they said it's disgusting.

421
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,680
 Look at all those excrement on the train tracks

422
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,600
 and they showed a picture of it,

423
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,120
 but then they pixelated everything you could possibly

424
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,960
 have dragged to.

425
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,120
 So it's just a picture of a train track.

426
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,120
 - So what do the others do?

427
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,520
 Do they have a sewage system?

428
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,520
 - They just story it.

429
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,240
 - Story of a tank. - Story of a tank, yeah.

430
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,800
 - Then they fling it out over the countryside

431
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,440
 whether it's... - No, they change it when they're service.

432
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,400
 Could they not build underneath the tracks

433
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,440
 just speaking of the excrement bits and Nappy?

434
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,880
 - Well, a big train Nappy, yes.

435
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,040
 (laughing)

436
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,720
 - You just lay the train on its back on a massive mat.

437
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,040
 (laughing)

438
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,320
 - Sorry Dan, it's honestly way better than what I was saying.

439
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,480
 We'll leave it to that.

440
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,600
 - Did you know we used to have sail trains in this country?

441
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,320
 - No, with what's a sail train?

442
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,040
 - Trains with a sail.

443
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,480
 And these existed as you'd imagine in kind of windier areas.

444
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,400
 So on the coast.

445
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,720
 And in Yorkshire there was one.

446
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,320
 There was one in 1831 that one opened

447
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,560
 which took produce from the Strathmore Valley

448
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,080
 which is in Scotland to Dundee.

449
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,840
 But obviously it had the problem of

450
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,280
 it's quite hard to tack on a trainway.

451
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,120
 (laughing)

452
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,760
 You can't really control the angle of which you're going.

453
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,000
 And so they had to have a horse trotting alongside it

454
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,480
 at all times to take over when the wind dropped.

455
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,360
 So it's very difficult to get every passenger to duck

456
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,680
 when the boom goes in.

457
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,840
 (laughing)

458
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,520
 - That in China, remember I had that fact

459
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,680
 in the super early days of the podcast about

460
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,920
 they have wheelbarrows in China that we still don't know about.

461
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,360
 So they used to do that in China

462
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,200
 and there's descriptions of it where this guy would see

463
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,560
 a fleet of sails coming when he looked over a mountain top

464
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,760
 in a field and what it was is that they used to put

465
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,400
 giant sails on their wheelbarrows and let the wind

466
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,160
 help them carry along.

467
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,000
 - That's so clever.

468
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,600
 - There are loads, yeah, it's amazing, isn't it?

469
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,080
 - Do you not the longest train ever was?

470
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,320
 - The longest train running at the moment,

471
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,640
 it's in someone's native country.

472
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,800
 - Who knows where Dan's from?

473
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,640
 - It's in Australia.

474
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,000
 - Oh it's in Australia, it's called the gun.

475
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,280
 - G-H-A-N.

476
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,120
 - Gun?

477
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:36,960
 - Gun.

478
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,240
 - So the Sunday service of the gun is 44 characters.

479
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,040
 It's 0.7 miles long.

480
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,280
 - It's about a 15 minute walk.

481
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,760
 - How far does it travel?

482
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,440
 Is it like it only moves about two meters

483
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,640
 and then it's at the next station

484
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,440
 and you have to walk all the way up the train?

485
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,840
 - Yeah, so you even need to go.

486
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,880
 - Yeah, 15 minute walk is like,

487
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,600
 if you're at the wrong end of the buffet

488
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,120
 carriages at the back of the train,

489
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,360
 - Oh, if you're starving, that way.

490
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,000
 - But, so if you built a car that long,

491
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,400
 that's impressive.

492
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,800
 But a train you're just adding carriages, right?

493
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,640
 - Yeah, yeah.

494
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,480
 - Is that impressive?

495
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,320
 - Yeah.

496
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,120
 - Effectively that could be much longer

497
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,240
 if they just added more.

498
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,240
 - There's two days freight trains

499
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,040
 that are like five, six kilometers long.

500
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,120
 - I was just, was this a passenger train?

501
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,960
 - This is a passenger train.

502
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,800
 - Yeah.

503
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,480
 - But you need platforms long enough.

504
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,440
 - That's the really, those are the unsung heroes

505
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,440
 of the operation people could pour in concrete

506
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,080
 for a year as a desert.

507
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,120
 - So where does it go to?

508
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,120
 - It goes across Australia.

509
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,280
 - Right, so it's a proper...

510
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,480
 - Yeah, I think it goes all the way

511
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,560
 from the north coast to the south.

512
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,400
 - Wow.

513
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,240
 - It's a huge long route.

514
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,080
 - Yeah, that's amazing.

515
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,920
 - So you'd need that.

516
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,080
 You'd need that for a variety of fun.

517
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,920
 - A variety of fun.

518
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,240
 - There's probably playrooms in there.

519
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,360
 There's probably a barbers.

520
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,520
 There's probably a cinema.

521
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,360
 There's probably...

522
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,040
 - There's none of these things, the facts.

523
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,800
 (laughing)

524
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,080
 - I can't just make up what your fantasy big train would be.

525
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,880
 - A real conjecture.

526
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,720
 I'm never seen you look so angry, I don't know.

527
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,480
 - Someone's going to remember that.

528
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,880
 And remember it is genuine knowledge.

529
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,960
 - I said probably.

530
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,960
 - I know, but...

531
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,360
 - Yeah, I mean, that's, that in itself is problematic,

532
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,360
 saying probably.

533
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,200
 - Really?

534
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,040
 - Of the balancer.

535
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:05,880
 - Yeah.

536
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,640
 - And the probability says there will be one of them.

537
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,080
 - But it probably is.

538
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,080
 (laughing)

539
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,520
 - There possibly is.

540
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,800
 - There probably isn't.

541
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,240
 - I think there probably is.

542
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,080
 - You can't say there probably isn't.

543
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,160
 - There's a microscopically small chance

544
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,360
 that there are all of those things you just listed

545
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,560
 as far as we can go with this fact, I think.

546
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,000
 - Okay, this is really cool.

547
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,920
 In Japan, they're now building new trains

548
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,480
 that are invisible.

549
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,320
 - No, they're not.

550
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,320
 - No, they're not, come on.

551
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,680
 (laughing)

552
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,560
 - What they are is kind of invisible.

553
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,280
 They're sort of almost invisible.

554
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,000
 They've put this mirrored surface on the outside of it.

555
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,840
 So it blends into its surroundings by reflecting.

556
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,240
 So if you're going through nature, for example,

557
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,720
 and you're surrounded by trees, blue sky, green grass,

558
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,080
 all that sort of stuff, if that's on the other side of it,

559
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,640
 that kind of mirrors off the side of the train.

560
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,120
 Therefore, oh, so you're not just going to see

561
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,280
 hundreds of passengers like sitting in there.

562
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,600
 - That's not that, yeah.

563
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,440
 - That's good.

564
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,480
 So if you're going on a nice countryside walk

565
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,520
 and your footpath crosses over a railway,

566
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,640
 then now you won't be able to see the train come towards you.

567
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,640
 - Yes, exactly.

568
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,480
 - The chance I do.

569
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,760
 - You would just see yourself coming towards you

570
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,600
 at high speed.

571
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,600
 - Oh, that was nice.

572
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,600
 - You're like, what?

573
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,040
 And that guy is running fast.

574
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:11,880
 (laughing)

575
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,460
 (upbeat music)

576
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:19,640
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

577
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,440
 and that is Chuzinski.

578
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,760
 - My fact this week is that birds and cages

579
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,880
 hop in the direction they're meant to be migrating.

580
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,720
 - Wow.

581
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,360
 - That sounds very sad.

582
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,480
 - Do they do that only during migrating periods?

583
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,720
 - Yes, this is the amazing thing about it.

584
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,520
 If you've got a cage bird that's a migrating bird,

585
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,160
 then as soon as the time comes,

586
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,880
 when it would usually be migrating, first of all,

587
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,120
 it puts on all this body fat 'cause that's what birds do.

588
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,560
 So a lot of birds will double their body weight

589
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,600
 in preparation for big migrations.

590
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,280
 So it'll put on all this weight,

591
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,640
 and it'll get really, really restless

592
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,440
 and frisky and start flapping around the cage.

593
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,440
 And then when the migration period starts,

594
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,400
 it will then start moving towards the end of the cage

595
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,680
 that is in the direction of where it would be migrating.

596
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,000
 And it will stop at exactly the time

597
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,800
 that it would have arrived at its destination.

598
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,640
 - Wow.

599
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,800
 - So perfectly timed.

600
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,320
 - But it's now fat.

601
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,160
 - Exactly.

602
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,040
 - It'll double its weight and it can't burn the weight off.

603
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,720
 And there's not where it wants to be.

604
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,560
 - Yeah.

605
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,400
 - Just in terms of observation of that,

606
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,760
 you obviously see the bird hopping that way,

607
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,400
 but it will reach the end of the cage.

608
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,640
 - Yeah, it's a good point, isn't it?

609
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,440
 - So it doesn't just hang by the end of the cage

610
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,280
 the whole time, right?

611
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,240
 Therefore, some people must observe the bird

612
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,840
 hopping the other way.

613
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:30,040
 - Yeah, so I think it will kind of maybe wander backwards a bit.

614
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,320
 This is actually not explained

615
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,880
 in a lot of the sources that reference it,

616
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,400
 but what it does do is it faces in that direction,

617
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,280
 it will try to flap towards that direction

618
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,720
 and then get rebounded off the cage, I guess.

619
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,680
 And also what they do is they'll sit on their perch,

620
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,560
 facing the direction they're supposed to be going,

621
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,160
 and they'll flap their wings a lot,

622
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,800
 but stay motionless 'cause they realize

623
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,040
 they can't get out of the cage during migration.

624
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:49,880
 - That's extraordinary.

625
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,800
 - So they'll flush her about.

626
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,000
 - Do you know how they found out about this?

627
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,640
 Or one of the ways they found out about this

628
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,440
 is with a device called an emlin funnel.

629
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,280
 - Yeah.

630
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,120
 - This is a very cool thing.

631
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,360
 So it's a plastic enclosure

632
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,360
 with a paper funnel leading out from the top of that.

633
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:06,040
 On the base of the funnel is ink pad.

634
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,800
 So you put the bird in there,

635
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,080
 you cover the top of the funnel.

636
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,560
 So it can't just fly out.

637
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,480
 And then you track the direction it moves in.

638
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:18,440
 And as it flaps, it leaves foot marks in the ink on the paper.

639
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,880
 So you can tell exactly the direction

640
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,040
 it's moving and flapping in.

641
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,400
 And they have at the surface,

642
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,560
 you can project different star constellations on the top

643
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,840
 to see if that has an effect,

644
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,400
 'cause sometimes they go magnetically,

645
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,560
 but sometimes they might do it

646
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,000
 by looking at the stars above them.

647
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,840
 - That's horrible.

648
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,160
 That's like a dethruman show for birds.

649
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,000
 - It is, yeah.

650
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 - Eventually they end up just writing messages

651
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,040
 in the ink saying, "Please God, somebody let me out."

652
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,560
 (laughing)

653
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,680
 Once they discovered this,

654
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,240
 then people realize you could do these brilliant experiments

655
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,560
 to work out what it was that causes birds to migrate

656
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,360
 in certain directions.

657
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,000
 So as you say, Andy, you could change the constellations

658
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,600
 to see if they navigated by that.

659
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,120
 You change the magnetic field around a bird's cage.

660
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,680
 So obviously they navigate by the magnetism of the earth.

661
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,320
 And so if you put a couple of magnets,

662
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,680
 you create a magnetic field around a bird cage

663
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,760
 and change the direction they think is north,

664
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,920
 they'll suddenly point in a different direction.

665
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,680
 - I heard on the radio the other day

666
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,000
 that whales that suddenly get lost in the ocean,

667
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,600
 they think it's actually down to solar flares

668
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,960
 because the solar flare is mess with the magnetism

669
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,760
 of the earth if you get hit by massive ones.

670
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,440
 So suddenly the whales would just be put

671
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,960
 on a different course and that's why groups of them

672
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,720
 have been, that's not a solid theory

673
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,320
 but because they just are trying to work out

674
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,600
 why seemingly healthy groups of whales get lost.

675
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,600
 - That's amazing.

676
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,640
 - Just one more thing related to this.

677
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,000
 So there was this amazing experiment done recently

678
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,200
 into reed warblers that were picked up in Russia

679
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,040
 and was to work out exactly how much birds can tell

680
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,080
 if you change the magnetic field.

681
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,760
 So scientists went and they found some reed warblers in Russia

682
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,320
 and they created a magnetic field around their enclosure

683
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,800
 that mimicked conditions in Aberdeen.

684
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,040
 And the weird thing about this is that.

685
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,520
 - That's a distinctive magnetic flavor of Aberdeen.

686
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,200
 Most of oil refineries that have been held

687
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,280
 in hard times recently.

688
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,320
 - Yeah, exactly, some weather spoons.

689
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:07,120
 So they did this but the weird thing was that Aberdeen

690
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,720
 is on roughly the same line of latitude.

691
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,560
 So the same distance from the equator

692
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,400
 as the place in Russia where they'd studied the birds.

693
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,560
 And so you would have thought that for them,

694
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,560
 if they're just testing the magnetic distance

695
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,080
 from the poles, they would think it was the same place

696
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,280
 but it turns out they can tell how far east or west

697
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,200
 they are as well.

698
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,000
 So what happened was all they did was change the magnetic field

699
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,440
 and the birds would usually point west

700
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,440
 'cause they were my great Europe, so south-west.

701
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,800
 And as soon as you change the field,

702
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,120
 the birds swiveled around and they pointed east

703
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,880
 knowing that they're in Aberdeen

704
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,520
 and they need to point in exactly a different direction

705
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,160
 in order to get where they're going to migrate to.

706
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,000
 - But they're very clever.

707
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,280
 - That's very cool.

708
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,040
 It's so weird that we're missing this thing

709
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,960
 that all these animals have.

710
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,800
 - It's so annoying.

711
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,640
 - You've got nothing that even remotely makes us go,

712
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,920
 oh, I can relate to that, which is nothing.

713
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,760
 There's no sense of magnetism's crazy.

714
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,880
 The thing you said about how birds put on loads of weight

715
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,120
 before they migrate so that they've got enough energy

716
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,640
 to get them through, it's amazing.

717
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:12,000
 Even their organs grow and shrink in this period.

718
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,800
 So all the organs involved with feeding,

719
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,200
 like the stomach and the liver and the kidneys and so on,

720
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,440
 they get bigger to support the fueling process.

721
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,160
 But then during the take-off and migration,

722
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,480
 those organ shrink and then the heart and the flight muscles,

723
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,000
 they all grow.

724
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,040
 - So it's a complete reconfiguration.

725
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,560
 They're changing the way the plane is built as they fly.

726
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,360
 - So cool.

727
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,760
 - That is amazing.

728
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,440
 That is awesome.

729
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,760
 - I should actually say the loads of what I'm saying

730
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,560
 comes from an episode of In Our Time,

731
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,000
 including the headline fact, which is on bird migration,

732
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,840
 which is brilliant.

733
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,360
 You should look it up, In Our Time is always good.

734
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,600
 - Yeah.

735
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,400
 - Yeah, when Planet Earth was coming out,

736
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,840
 the David Adamborough documentary,

737
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,640
 I was sat watching Alistair Fothergill,

738
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,520
 who is the program maker behind Blue Planet and Planet Earth.

739
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,960
 I went to a chat that he did of sort of talk at the BBC.

740
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,120
 And he was talking about his favorite moment,

741
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,960
 being the moment that the birds had to migrate over Everest.

742
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,880
 In order to migrate, they had to go over Mount Everest.

743
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,320
 And it took every ounce of their energy.

744
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,680
 - You get geese flying over Mount Everest.

745
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,520
 - Dee!

746
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,960
 - You've taken all your energy,

747
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,040
 just see a flock of geese flying over you.

748
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,440
 Are they using thermals or are they flying?

749
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,440
 They are flying.

750
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,960
 They never stop flapping their wings.

751
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,120
 They never glide.

752
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,520
 - They never glide?

753
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,360
 - They never glide.

754
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,640
 - It's so rough for us like that.

755
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,720
 - There's only, I think, what is it?

756
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,720
 A tenth of the oxygen you find at sea level.

757
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,080
 Obviously, when you're up that high,

758
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,720
 and they're still managing to fly all the time.

759
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,800
 - So they are panting presumably at that point?

760
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,720
 - We worked out that geese couldn't glide.

761
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:50,680
 Have we tried to make any ounce of stuff to dead goose

762
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,600
 and kind of do a glider?

763
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,280
 - What I mean is, like, do scientists

764
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,240
 knowing the makeup of a geese know they could do it?

765
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,960
 They just haven't worked out to do it.

766
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,800
 - They just don't have the confidence.

767
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,320
 (laughing)

768
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,640
 'Cause presumably, if they're up there

769
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,280
 and their wings are, you know, they've got wings,

770
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,000
 surely just spreading them out, must buy them some glider.

771
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,840
 - I think they're quite, I think creatures, they're quite,

772
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,680
 I don't know.

773
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,520
 I really don't know.

774
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,360
 - They wouldn't be able to, 'cause of evolution.

775
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,640
 - So the ones that try to fly, a long time ago.

776
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,160
 - The evolution of creation.

777
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,240
 - The evolution of creation.

778
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,240
 - The evolution of creation.

779
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,000
 - That's your answer every week.

780
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 - There was ones that go just like you, Dad.

781
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,400
 - She's always right, don't care.

782
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,440
 (laughing)

783
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,280
 - When is God gonna be the answer, ever?

784
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,520
 (laughing)

785
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,100
 (upbeat music)

786
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:38,120
 - Okay, there's time for our final fact of the show,

787
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,440
 and that is my fact.

788
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,280
 My fact is that each year,

789
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,640
 26 tons of clothing is left behind

790
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,080
 at the starting line of the Boston marathon.

791
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:53,040
 That is one ton for every mile of the marathon.

792
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,400
 - But why?

793
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,920
 I mean, why people, as people just taking off all their clothes

794
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,480
 when they get to the start of the marathon?

795
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,040
 - This is exactly what's happening.

796
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,320
 It's early in the morning, it's gonna be cold.

797
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,920
 So they bring long trackies, a zip up jacket or whatever,

798
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,160
 and then when the marathon starts,

799
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,920
 they take off the outer clothing

800
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,040
 so that they're in the classic marathon runner clothing.

801
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,800
 - And they just drop it where it is.

802
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,640
 - They just drop it where it is.

803
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,760
 - That's gonna be difficult if you're right

804
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,600
 at the back of the marathon.

805
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,800
 You've got a huge, like a horse jump to go.

806
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,520
 (laughing)

807
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,560
 - Yeah, a really good point.

808
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,440
 - Yeah, I think they chuck it to the side.

809
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,280
 - Okay.

810
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,840
 - This is an article that was written

811
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,960
 about a person in America called Judy Patasi,

812
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,640
 and Judy Patasi used to help marathon runners

813
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,280
 if they needed somewhere.

814
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,880
 Some coffee and some tea and stuff.

815
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,280
 It was just generally a helpful person, love the marathon.

816
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,240
 And for years, runners would be doing this,

817
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,720
 just taking off those bits of clothing,

818
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,800
 leaving them on the ground,

819
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,360
 and occasionally charities would come and collect some of them

820
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,800
 and bring them to charities.

821
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,640
 And in one year, no charities came.

822
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,240
 And they bagged up all the stuff and they threw it in the trash

823
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,720
 and that really infuriated her

824
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,920
 'cause she said this is such a waste.

825
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,240
 So she's made it her mission

826
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,200
 to now collect all of these clothes.

827
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,760
 And to begin with, it wasn't as much as 26 tons.

828
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,720
 It was even less.

829
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,880
 It changes all the time.

830
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,680
 The latest article, the article I'm specifically getting it from,

831
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,880
 it was 26 that they managed to collect.

832
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,040
 Obviously it varies year by year.

833
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:14,160
 The exact quote from her is now I have 201 volunteers.

834
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,880
 We cover all the way to Ashland Townline

835
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,560
 and we've gotten up to 52,000 pounds,

836
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:22,240
 which is the equivalent of 26 tons.

837
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,320
 That is amazing.

838
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,400
 And the reason it's gone up dramatically

839
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,280
 is because there used to be a bus service

840
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,240
 right at the end of the Boston marathon

841
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,760
 that would bring you back to the start

842
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,560
 so people could collect their clothes

843
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,360
 but they canceled the bus service.

844
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,360
 So now all of these clothes, people just go,

845
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,160
 what do you know, we'll just leave it there.

846
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,320
 So they now collect these all

847
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,680
 and they give them to charities and raise so much money.

848
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,480
 But yeah.

849
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,960
 There must be an awareness thing as well though.

850
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,800
 If you run, you know what's going to happen to the clothes

851
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,560
 so you think, well, I'm just going to bring loads of clothes

852
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,400
 and stuff.

853
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,240
 I would hope so, because--

854
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,120
 Hey, I can't believe running a marathon is hard enough

855
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,600
 without having to admit to yourself

856
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,920
 that you have to lose an entire outfit in the process.

857
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,920
 And also, I'm the kind of unlikable person

858
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,320
 who would definitely throw my clothes aside,

859
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,760
 bear in mind where I'd thrown them

860
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,880
 and then walk back a bit later to pick them up.

861
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,160
 And I'd be pretty irritated if they'd been sent to South

862
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,640
 who'd down by that point.

863
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,440
 So there's a thing about the Boston Marathon

864
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,640
 which is that it's for--

865
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,040
 it's for very good runners as in.

866
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,800
 Obviously, all marathons are for very good runners.

867
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:18,360
 But only the fastest amateurs get in and qualify

868
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,440
 for the Boston Marathon.

869
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,480
 So there is a guy, his name is Derek Murphy.

870
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,760
 He's an American man.

871
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,680
 And he is a marathon enthusiast.

872
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:30,320
 And he's made it his life's work to spot people cheating

873
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,960
 in marathons from hundreds of miles away.

874
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,600
 Hundreds of miles away.

875
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,240
 Yeah, he's got this incredible telescope.

876
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,000
 But it's only 26 miles.

877
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,280
 Who's some really elaborate cheating going on?

878
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,560
 When you run the other way around the world, yes.

879
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,480
 So the BBC did a profile of him.

880
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,560
 He has this blog called Marathon Investigation.

881
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,600
 And he started wondering whether people

882
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,880
 cheat to get to qualify for the Boston Marathon.

883
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,280
 They'll run another marathon, which you have to do.

884
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,520
 And he looks at suspiciously fast times.

885
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,120
 And he looks at photos taken during the race

886
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,680
 to see if he can track people down.

887
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,800
 So he's caught people who've used other people's bib numbers,

888
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,760
 or he's caught people who've perhaps missed out stages

889
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,600
 throughout.

890
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,760
 But he has also vindicated at least one person,

891
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,120
 where the authorities thought that runner was cheating.

892
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,960
 And he managed to find the evidence to say,

893
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,320
 no, I don't think his person was cheating, isn't it?

894
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,440
 Why is he--

895
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:23,400
 I mean, I really support vigilante justice

896
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,160
 in certain cases, I suppose.

897
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,920
 But is this a major problem in morality and crime?

898
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:33,440
 If you support Batman, you should support this guy.

899
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,680
 That's what I'm saying.

900
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,680
 This is like--

901
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,560
 And actually, the downgrade the Batman

902
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,520
 would have to take to be doing that.

903
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,520
 So in 1980, there was a woman called Rosie Ruiz,

904
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,880
 who was declared the winner of the marathon.

905
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,240
 But then it was later found out that she

906
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,320
 had taken the subway for part of the way, frowned on.

907
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,000
 Yeah, this is frowned on.

908
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,840
 Can't if no one noticed her ducking out of the marathon,

909
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,800
 popping into a subway station, and then--

910
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,640
 But you probably think someone was ducking out

911
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,480
 just to get themselves the drink or--

912
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,840
 Or ducking out altogether, being like, actually,

913
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,520
 this is not for me.

914
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,560
 And it can't be lined all the way, can it?

915
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,920
 It's in 1980 as well, maybe it was just less organized.

916
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,160
 But I think the suspicious bit is when you come out of the subway

917
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:10,960
 and join the race.

918
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,840
 That's the crucial--

919
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,240
 That's true, yeah.

920
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:16,360
 I read about it, lady, because you can go off trail.

921
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:20,360
 A Florida woman who became lost during a half marathon

922
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,560
 when she just took the wrong corner.

923
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,520
 So she was found nearly 12 hours later

924
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:28,440
 in the middle of a 25,000 acre park just completely lost.

925
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,400
 Oh, no.

926
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:33,480
 At what point do you think you stop running?

927
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,760
 At what point is it obvious to you

928
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,760
 that you're now no longer running the marathon?

929
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,120
 Yes, yeah.

930
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,760
 Do you think she just thought she was way ahead?

931
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,120
 I didn't know that you have to wear it

932
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,280
 that one of those bibs when you run a marathon.

933
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:47,800
 Yeah.

934
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,520
 They have trackers in them, and they

935
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,440
 have mats across the marathon course,

936
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,600
 which electronically log you making particular checkpoints

937
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,480
 along the way.

938
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,600
 That is not made, you sure?

939
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,400
 Anyone who's ever run a marathon knows that,

940
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,320
 but I had no idea.

941
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,800
 That's like in a computer game when you get hit checkpoints.

942
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,760
 Exactly, yeah.

943
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,640
 And so sometimes that's the way of identifying cheaters

944
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,800
 if the bib missed out several checkpoints.

945
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,040
 Yeah, yeah.

946
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:14,960
 So another cheater was a woman called Catherine Swiser,

947
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,800
 who-- so maybe your guy with a telescope

948
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,120
 might want to get onto her.

949
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:22,760
 She was a woman, and she tried to run the marathon in 1967.

950
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,760
 And she registered with just her initials,

951
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,440
 so it was gender neutral, so it wasn't

952
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,600
 known that she was a woman.

953
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,120
 And she ran the marathon.

954
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,800
 And people were quite supportive in the crowds,

955
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,120
 but then Jock Semple, who was a race official,

956
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,920
 was really against the idea of women running.

957
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,840
 People thought women were way too fragile.

958
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,880
 It kind of muddied the masculinity of the sport for men.

959
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,760
 And so he stormed onto the track and tried to drag her off it,

960
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,320
 at which point her boyfriend came and kind of defended

961
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,840
 her, which is a little bit annoying

962
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,640
 from the feminist perspective, but her boyfriend

963
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,680
 came on and pushed Jock Semple out the way.

964
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,920
 And she finished.

965
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,360
 And the nice thing about her is that this year

966
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,720
 was the 50th anniversary of when she did that,

967
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,640
 and she ran it again.

968
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,640
 Great.

969
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,240
 How was she?

970
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,440
 She wasn't a cheater, though.

971
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,120
 Was she?

972
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,240
 Yeah, she cheated by pretending to be a man.

973
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:05,720
 OK.

974
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,360
 Technically speaking, she wasn't allowed to enter.

975
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,200
 Yes, right.

976
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:08,960
 Yeah.

977
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,640
 I guess so.

978
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,600
 She's the bad guy in this story, anyway.

979
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,240
 The furthest away, I guess, that the marathon

980
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,520
 has ever been run off the course,

981
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,000
 since we were talking about that, is Sunita Williams,

982
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,720
 who's a NASA astronaut, and she ran it

983
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,720
 while she was on the International Space Station,

984
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,880
 on the treadmill.

985
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,880
 So someone argue she was going way faster than anyone

986
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,680
 asking, she was coaching me, yeah, for the very time.

987
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,960
 There's a thing about the Berlin marathon,

988
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:33,440
 which is that loads of records get broken on that marathon course

989
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,320
 and not, for example, on the London one,

990
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,520
 or the Kuala Lumpur one, or the Boston one.

991
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,960
 And there are all these reasons which

992
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,280
 combine to make Berlin one of the best places

993
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,840
 to break a speed record.

994
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,720
 So it's really flat.

995
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,200
 There are very few corners.

996
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,840
 It's never more than 53 meters above sea level.

997
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,240
 So lots of lovely oxygen.

998
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,160
 And it's in September, which is quite a good time of year,

999
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,400
 because the weather's not crazy.

1000
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,800
 And it's mostly on asphalt.

1001
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,320
 And so there are all of these different combination

1002
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:00,480
 factors that conspire to make it a great best record.

1003
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,800
 Whereas Boston, the Boston marathon course,

1004
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,960
 the finish line is so much lower than the starting line

1005
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,640
 that it is ineligible for world record attempts.

1006
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,640
 - No way. - Yeah.

1007
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,840
 Because you're running downhill, basically,

1008
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,320
 you're running downhill.

1009
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,520
 - Wow. - No way.

1010
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,840
 - Why don't they just move it then?

1011
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,680
 I don't know.

1012
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,520
 I'll put it the other way around.

1013
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,320
 - Put it the other way around.

1014
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,480
 - Record breaking in the Boston marathon

1015
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,320
 is a quite interesting thing.

1016
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,720
 So in 2010, a guy broke the world

1017
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,760
 record for Boston Marta.

1018
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,760
 His name was Robert K. Chirio from Kenya.

1019
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,560
 But he broke the record that was set previously

1020
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,280
 by a man also named Robert K. Chirio

1021
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,840
 by complete coincidence, no relation.

1022
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,920
 - No relation. - No relation.

1023
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,760
 - So weird, right?

1024
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,400
 He must have changed his name to, no, no.

1025
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,840
 I mean, I suppose you may be to more common,

1026
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,720
 maybe it's a bit like a John Smith for your name or something,

1027
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,680
 but that's amazing.

1028
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,600
 - So the first African person to win the Boston marathon

1029
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,280
 won it in 1988.

1030
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,560
 I guess probably because logistics got easier

1031
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,080
 for people to enter at that point, maybe from abroad.

1032
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,600
 So 1988 was the first African person to win it.

1033
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,680
 It was Ibrahim Hussein from Kenya.

1034
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,400
 Since then, there have only been three winners

1035
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,280
 who haven't been Kenya or Ethiopia.

1036
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,880
 (laughing)

1037
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,920
 He'll just win.

1038
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,440
 Oh, we're actually much better at this than these guys.

1039
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,680
 (laughing)

1040
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:17,260
 (upbeat music)

1041
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:21,000
 - Okay, that is it.

1042
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,200
 That is all of our facts.

1043
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,760
 Thank you so much for listening.

1044
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,520
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

1045
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,840
 about the things that we have said

1046
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,080
 over the course of this podcast,

1047
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,240
 we can be found on our Twitter accounts.

1048
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,760
 I'm on @ShriverLand.

 - Yep, or you can go to our website.

1056
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,640
 No such thing as a fish.com.

1057
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,320
 We have links to the tour that we're doing

1058
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,160
 at the end of this year.
