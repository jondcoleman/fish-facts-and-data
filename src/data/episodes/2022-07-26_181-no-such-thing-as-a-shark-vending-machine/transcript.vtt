WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
 - Hey guys, welcome to this week's episode

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.760
 and no such thing as a fish.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.960
 Before we begin, we have an announcement to make.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.000
 - What's the announcement then?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.440
 - The announcement is that we're doing a live show.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.280
 - Get out of here.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.400
 - Yeah, at a book festival.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.240
 - No.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.560
 - Yeah, Cheltenham Book Festival, we're so excited.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.080
 It is in Cheltenham.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.480
 - It's in Cheltenham, nice.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.040
 - It's on the 11th of October, it's at 6 p.m.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.920
 We're doing it because we're releasing our book in November

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.040
 and this is gonna be the first ever event

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.840
 where we bring our book to.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.200
 We're not gonna have the physical book with us,

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.040
 it's not publish yet.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.600
 - We're gonna have our heads because we've written it,

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.440
 we know it.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.280
 - Exactly.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.160
 - So the whole event is gonna be a live podcast,

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.800
 we're gonna take our facts from the upcoming book

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.800
 and we're gonna do a Q and A afterwards

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.640
 and it's gonna be awesome, it's a legit book festival.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.720
 - It'll be really fun if you've never been to our live shows.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.760
 So go to qi.com/fishevents to get tickets for that

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.960
 or you can just look on the Cheltenham Festival website,

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.040
 11th of October.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.960
 - So I get a qi.com/fishevents.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:57.800
 - That's correct.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.640
 - That's correct.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.480
 - Yeah.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.320
 - Do you write that down?

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.160
 - Do you write that down?

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.000
 - Do you write that down?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.160
 - How do you spell qi?

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.040
 - Okay, on with this week's show.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.480
 (upbeat music)

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.280
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:22.440
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.160
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.880
 coming to you from the QI offices

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.280
 in Covenant Garden.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.440
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.160
 with Andrew Hunter-Mari, Anacizansky, and Alex Bell.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.520
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.480
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.240
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.120
 Starting with you, Andy.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.600
 - My fact is that the original director of "Jaws"

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.360
 was a man called Richard Richards who was fired

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.400
 because he kept referring to the shark as a whale.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.200
 (laughing)

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.760
 - So he did not read the script?

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.600
 - I don't know if he had read it or not,

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.080
 but he had, he definitely had.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.240
 (laughing)

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.880
 He had because when you say he kept referring to it,

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.920
 it wasn't even like loosely in conversation.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.160
 He was in a meeting with the producers.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.600
 He'd ridden a treatment where all the way through

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.680
 the treatment, he kept saying, "And then the whale."

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.960
 (laughing)

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.840
 - Yeah, the producers have got the rights

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.560
 to turn the novel "Jaws" into the film

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.760
 and they took him for lunch and they decided to let him go.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.240
 - And then they gave it to Spielberg.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.440
 - That's right, yeah.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.440
 - Here's a classic bit of trivia

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.160
 that I bet everyone who knows "Jaws" knows.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.360
 But again, I didn't know that this shark has a name.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.360
 - Oh yeah. - I am.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.120
 - Not in the movie, just on set.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.200
 (laughing)

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.960
 So like we know on the back of his seat.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.160
 (laughing)

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.160
 - Actors and directors, which was Bruce.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.120
 - Wasn't he named after Steven Spielberg Gloya?

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.960
 - That's right, yeah.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.200
 He was named after his lawyer who was called Bruce Raynor

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.360
 and Bruce became the name of the shark on the set.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.840
 - Bruce is quite a good name though, isn't it, for a shark?

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.680
 There's something about it.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.560
 I know it's an Australian sounding name.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.880
 I think a shark's being Australian.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.880
 - It's the name, you know how you're making that connection.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.760
 It's the name of the shark and finding Nemo.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.680
 - Oh.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.760
 - That must be a nod to that.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.200
 - It must be, absolutely.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.480
 - Well, it's a good thing they didn't give it

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.880
 the other nickname that it had on set,

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.440
 which was the great white turd.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.280
 - Yeah.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.480
 - And also flaws, because they were never worked.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.320
 - Yeah, which I like.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.880
 - Spielberg basically rewrote the movie a bit

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.080
 because they couldn't get the shark to work.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.320
 It was such a bad mechanical shark.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.960
 Which is, I mean, you know, if you're filming

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.480
 anything mechanical in saltwater, it's gonna be difficult.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.320
 - Yeah.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.280
 - So they made three mechanical sharks

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.960
 so that they could film it from different angles

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.080
 with different bits.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.720
 There had to be 16 people on a nearby floating barge

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.640
 operating different bits of the shark.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:41.640
 - 'Cause the whole thing was pneumatic.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.040
 They had loads of nodes of piped operate

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.600
 because they had motors which all broke.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.440
 So they had to put pneumatic tubes in to make it work,

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.240
 which meant they had to have a huge, like,

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.800
 operating station which was quite off-scaling.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.640
 - I know.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.320
 - So they compared it to an orchestra in an article I read.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.360
 So they all had to be doing the right things.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.040
 All 16 people at the right time.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.360
 So it all works properly.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.680
 And sometimes there would be a bit where 15 people

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.640
 got a right and the shark comes out of the water

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.480
 as you're filming.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.720
 But then it's mechanical eyes are shut.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:07.560
 - Oh, yeah.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.440
 - So then you have to go back and do it again.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.280
 And then something else won't be working right

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.600
 or one of the fins will be whacking me.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.680
 - Are they given it mechanical eyelids?

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.160
 (laughing)

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.280
 - It was the eyelids.

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.720
 - It is George, ever blink.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.880
 We need to rewatch that film.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.080
 - It's not a classic moment.

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.000
 There's no one I wink that he give to the camera

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.240
 just before he eats some of it.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.040
 - They wanted, actually, the producers asked Spielberg

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.280
 to train a great white shark initially for the film, yeah.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.120
 - That is so hollywood.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.960
 - Yeah.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.720
 (laughing)

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.120
 - Turns out you can't do that.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.960
 (laughing)

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.120
 - That is amazing.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.200
 - He moved on to this.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.600
 Did you know that for some of the shots

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.000
 in order to make the shark look bigger,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.640
 they used a body double for the guy who placed

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.640
 the main character.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.160
 And they used a jockey, 'cause he was really small.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.320
 So they used a 4 foot 9x jockey to be in a in the shark tank

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.840
 just to make it look that bit bigger.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.160
 - That's a bit like I know all these films

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.000
 like in Casablanca.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.960
 They had small people wandering around

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.800
 the cutout of the plane in that famous last scene

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.200
 in the background, 'cause it makes the plane look bigger,

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.840
 so they had to have a bigger cutout.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:08.680
 It was like that.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.200
 All sorts of like, perspective, gags like that.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.600
 - Did you know one of the main problems with jaws,

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.320
 the mechanical one?

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.600
 It's the jaws.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.320
 The jaws are not right in the jaws of the thing.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.120
 They're not right for a shark or they just wouldn't work.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.240
 - They're not right for a shark.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.440
 I'm sure they wouldn't work at various points,

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.920
 but this is really interesting.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.960
 Think great white sharks have a much weaker bite

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.680
 than you might suspect.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.240
 They're not weak.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.920
 No one's saying they're weak,

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.560
 but their jaws aren't attached to their head properly.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.120
 So they operate with a separate muscle.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.000
 And what that means is what they can do

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.120
 is approach you in the water

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.280
 and give you a test bite, which is soft.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.760
 And then if they like the taste of you

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.880
 and they think you'd be good,

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.600
 they come back for a kill bite.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.200
 So loads of people who have had a time

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.680
 with a great white shark and escaped

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.000
 have probably been given a test bite,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.600
 which is still serious and you can still bleed to death,

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.720
 obviously, but they haven't been given the full kill bite.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.720
 - I do that with food.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:01.920
 - It's really weird, I like it.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.280
 (all laughing)

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.960
 - It's not kind of a restaurant with you.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.680
 (all laughing)

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.760
 'Cause then you walk off around the restaurant

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.000
 once you're given a test bite.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.840
 (all laughing)

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.720
 But the jaws obviously on the mechanical shark,

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.240
 they don't have those two gradations.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.800
 So it's just a massive hinge and it's just not shithaway.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:20.960
 - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.560
 - So why do they do the test bite?

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.000
 Why don't they just go in with the big bites

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 to say the energy or something?

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.600
 - Well, they might not like what they eat, you know?

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.000
 They might find, oh, it's all full of bone.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.040
 I don't want to eat the bone.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.160
 They might say, oh, go off and find a seal to eat and stay

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.440
 'cause they're all blubber and delicious.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.600
 - I guess when you've got a mouth out big,

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.280
 you're kind of committing when you're biting something,

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.600
 you've got to do something with it.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.080
 - What if there's a tree floating in the water

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:40.920
 and you make a mistake?

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.680
 If you go in for a massive kill bite,

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.240
 you'll feel like an idiot. - Yeah, whereas if you give it a quick test,

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.200
 no, that's a tree, I knew it was a tree.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.360
 - So here's something interesting.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:54.680
 When they first put the shark into salt water, it sank.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.760
 So when they were going to film,

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.720
 and they had to retrieve it from the bottom of Martha's Vineyard,

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.520
 and it's because it was salt water

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:04.040
 and they don't ever attest it is in freshwater,

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.760
 which they were expecting that it was going to work

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.920
 like it did in freshwater, but then it sank to the bottom,

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.320
 which is the exact opposite of how a real shark would work.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.360
 And do you remember I mentioned this a few episodes

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.200
 go on the podcast, they don't have a swim bladder,

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.200
 and so they don't often go into freshwater

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.880
 because it doesn't work there, so they'll sink in freshwater.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.920
 - But I don't understand, so obviously salty water is more buoyant,

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.360
 and so I don't understand what would sink

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.760
 in salt water that wouldn't sink in freshwater.

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:31.600
 - No one does.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.880
 - I don't think this is one of those universal mysteries.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.520
 (laughing)

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.520
 - No one does, but which I mean, I don't know.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.280
 (laughing)

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.080
 - I've got something so bizarre that I found out.

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:41.920
 - Yeah.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.040
 - Of course of this, which is that it is related,

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.920
 but you're not going to get know why initially.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:50.720
 So polygraph tests are sold very often across the US,

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.800
 like you can sell your polygraph testing services

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.160
 for various reasons, and all the websites

00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:00.520
 that advertise polygraph tests say you can use these four,

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.560
 and then there's list of the main things you use them for.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:07.280
 So for theft, arson, murder, robbery, infidelity, assault,

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.080
 and fishing tournaments, and it turns out,

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:13.000
 so I learned this looking at these sharp catching tournaments,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.200
 and the idea is that you go,

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.520
 and you have to catch the biggest shark that you possibly can,

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.320
 and one of the main uses of polygraph tests

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.080
 is having lie detector tests after these tournaments

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.720
 to check the people haven't cheated.

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:24.560
 - No.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.880
 - Yeah, this is what, and it's on all these lie detector websites,

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.760
 they're like, yeah, murder, arson, cheating wives,

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.040
 fishing tournament, obviously.

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.080
 - Cheating the shark as you can.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.080
 - Because.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.720
 - No, what you do is there are shark sales people

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.400
 who collect large sharks around the year

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:39.240
 and keep them alive,

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:41.360
 and then they flog them to people who've entered the tournaments

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.480
 on the slide, so you go buy a shark.

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.520
 - So you go live at the tour of it with a giant shark

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:51.040
 in your bag, get on a boat and let the slowly lower it

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.040
 on your jacket.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:52.880
 (laughing)

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.360
 - That's why bag searches originally come from sharks.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.200
 - Right.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:59.560
 - The guy, who's the guy here at the original book,

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:00.400
 he really regressed it.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:01.240
 - Bentley.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.080
 - Bentley.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.800
 - Yeah, so Peter Bentley regretted the fact

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.400
 that sharks have vilified via jaws,

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.800
 and suddenly it's set off this spate of shark hunting

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.960
 and shark murdering expeditions,

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.560
 and shark populations in America were reduced by it

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.800
 up to 50% some people say,

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.800
 not just because of shark hunting,

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.920
 but that was a huge thing and it still happens today,

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.320
 these shark hunting tournaments,

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.640
 caused by the fact that it created this bad reputation

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:28.560
 for sharks who obviously only kill about one person

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:29.480
 every two years,

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.240
 whereas we kill hundreds of thousands of them every year.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.200
 - I think it's something like a hundred million sharks

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.840
 per year that once kill.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:36.680
 - What?

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:37.520
 - Yeah, it's huge.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:38.600
 - It's a massive number.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.800
 - This is about great fact about how

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.080
 vending machines kill twice as many humans as sharks do.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:42.920
 - Yeah.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:43.760
 - Mm.

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.760
 - But if we had a shark in the corridor at the school,

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.600
 I think the figures might start creeping up.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.440
 (laughing)

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.600
 - If you could only get a twix by reaching

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:53.800
 into the mouth of a shark.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.120
 (laughing)

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:58.700
 (upbeat music)

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:03.080
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two,

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.880
 and that is Alex.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.520
 My fact this week is that until the 1960s,

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.160
 high speed trains in Britain would drop carriages

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.200
 off at stations that they weren't stopping at.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.520
 - So your train is going along?

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:16.360
 - Yeah.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.720
 - And then all the people in the back

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.640
 carriage wanted to get off at the next stop,

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:20.640
 but the train's not stopping.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:21.560
 - There's a high speed train, yeah.

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:22.680
 - It's a high speed train.

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:24.520
 So you have to run into the back carriage

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.200
 and then they just cut it off.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.720
 - Yeah, I don't think everyone would,

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.600
 I think I would get in and sit at the back carriage

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.160
 but you wouldn't just like run and jump

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.040
 as the carriage is not leaving the train.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.400
 But they would uncouple the trainers,

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:35.720
 they were approaching the station,

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.960
 and there would be a guard in that carriage with a brake,

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.720
 and then the carriage would just roll to a stop at station

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.120
 which meant that anyone who wanted to get off

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:43.960
 at that station could,

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.080
 but it wouldn't slow down the train.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.240
 So what would they do with then the carriage?

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.080
 Oh, this is the clever bit

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.600
 because the carriages would then be picked up

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.440
 by the next slow train that was coming through.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:54.160
 So the slow trains would actually get carriages added on.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.720
 - Why is it only high speed trains?

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.560
 It seems like they're the most difficult trains

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.840
 to accurately drop of a carriage at a station.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.600
 - I don't think the high speed trains are going faster

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.840
 than the actual trains.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.360
 - It's high speed is in express trains,

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.680
 they're not stopping at the station.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.840
 That's what's excellent when you stop at every station.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.160
 - So when do they stop doing this?

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.680
 - Well, they did it for like 40, 50 years

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.600
 and then finished in the 1960s.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.720
 And now the replacement service is when you get on a train

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.200
 and it splits in two parts,

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.640
 when you get to a certain station.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:18.480
 - So that's what it looks like.

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.320
 - That's so cool.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.000
 So like in theory our grandparents should remember that.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.840
 - Yeah, if they lived in England, you know,

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.080
 they might have been on one of the jettisoned.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.800
 - It was a pretty common thing. - Trains, wow.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.880
 - Another thing you could do until the 1970s,

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.000
 so this is from 1889 to the 1970s,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.240
 anyone on the train could cause the train to break.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:37.560
 And this still happens in trains around the world,

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:38.800
 quite a bit. - Yeah.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.640
 - But now I think the driver has an override button.

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:42.640
 So, but I didn't realize this,

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:45.120
 there was a cord that ran all the way from,

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.440
 you know, where the driver's sitting

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.520
 and where the brakes are,

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.800
 all the way along the roof to the back of the train

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.280
 and a little cord drops down each carriage and you pull it.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:55.280
 But what you have now is you pull the cord

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.160
 and the driver has three seconds to decide

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.800
 whether to override it.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:01.320
 So if the driver sees the cord's been pulled,

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:04.640
 he's got three seconds to make a crucial decision of,

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.320
 is it worth stopping for this emergency?

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.040
 I don't know what this emergency is probably

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.160
 'cause a passenger's done it and I can't see it.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.160
 - Yeah, but what kind of information can he get

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.000
 in those three seconds? - Yeah.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.240
 - How does that help? - Well, exactly.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:17.480
 I don't know. - Maybe he's running late.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.640
 And he thinks it can't be that bad.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:22.680
 - But maybe things were coming into a station in a minute.

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.680
 So let's speed it better. - Yeah, that's true.

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:25.680
 - Maybe that's it.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.040
 - He has got a communication line

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.600
 with the passengers pulled the cord as well.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.480
 So he can't just shout, "Wink, wink, wink, wink."

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:32.680
 What's going on? What's going on?

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:33.920
 You wouldn't have time.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.080
 Three seconds is all enough. - No, look at that.

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:36.920
 - I don't know. - I don't know.

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.120
 Most of my conversations with my father

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:41.200
 are about three seconds, and we say everything we need to.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.960
 (laughing)

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.520
 Yeah, I was on a train to Edinburgh not too long ago

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.600
 and in the bathroom, just above the toilet,

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.240
 there was a big red button that said stop.

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.240
 - We're in the bathroom, wasn't it?

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.080
 - There's in the toilet.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:53.920
 - I couldn't believe it. - I couldn't believe it.

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:54.760
 - I couldn't believe it. - I didn't go down.

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:55.600
 I could just stop the train.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.640
 It was a train stop button in the toilet.

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.120
 - It's interesting you raised the toilet thing

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.120
 because there's a blog by someone who works in railways

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.480
 who says that this is a serious problem

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.400
 with the emergency button because it is

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:05.840
 in the accessible toilets.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.920
 And people often pull it thinking it's the flush.

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:08.760
 - Yes.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.120
 - If you're an older person, you're a bit confused

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:12.920
 or a bit drunk, then it often gets pulled to flush the loo

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:14.080
 and then you've breaks the train.

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:16.600
 - Okay, so one in 10 train characters in the UK

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:21.160
 still jettison's toilet waste onto the track

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.000
 or the flush. - Do they?

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:22.840
 - One in 10.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:23.840
 This was in 2015.

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:26.560
 So they are trying to replace them all by 2020,

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.280
 but it's still quite a large number.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:29.120
 - Yeah.

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.120
 - And that's why they're assigned saying don't flush.

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:31.960
 - At station.

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:33.760
 - At stations, but it's pretty medieval.

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:34.920
 - It's pretty medieval.

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:38.280
 Well, there was a massive report in Wales online recently

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.880
 in which they said it's disgusting.

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.680
 Look at all those excrement on the train tracks

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:42.600
 and they showed a picture of it,

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:45.120
 but then they pixelated everything you could possibly

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:45.960
 have dragged to.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:48.120
 So it's just a picture of a train track.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:49.120
 - So what do the others do?

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.520
 Do they have a sewage system?

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:51.520
 - They just story it.

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.240
 - Story of a tank. - Story of a tank, yeah.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:54.800
 - Then they fling it out over the countryside

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.440
 whether it's... - No, they change it when they're service.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.400
 Could they not build underneath the tracks

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.440
 just speaking of the excrement bits and Nappy?

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:05.880
 - Well, a big train Nappy, yes.

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:08.040
 (laughing)

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.720
 - You just lay the train on its back on a massive mat.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.040
 (laughing)

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:15.320
 - Sorry Dan, it's honestly way better than what I was saying.

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.480
 We'll leave it to that.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.600
 - Did you know we used to have sail trains in this country?

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.320
 - No, with what's a sail train?

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:23.040
 - Trains with a sail.

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:27.480
 And these existed as you'd imagine in kind of windier areas.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.400
 So on the coast.

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.720
 And in Yorkshire there was one.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.320
 There was one in 1831 that one opened

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.560
 which took produce from the Strathmore Valley

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:40.080
 which is in Scotland to Dundee.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:41.840
 But obviously it had the problem of

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.280
 it's quite hard to tack on a trainway.

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:45.120
 (laughing)

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.760
 You can't really control the angle of which you're going.

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:50.000
 And so they had to have a horse trotting alongside it

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.480
 at all times to take over when the wind dropped.

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.360
 So it's very difficult to get every passenger to duck

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.680
 when the boom goes in.

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.840
 (laughing)

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:00.520
 - That in China, remember I had that fact

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.680
 in the super early days of the podcast about

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:05.920
 they have wheelbarrows in China that we still don't know about.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:08.360
 So they used to do that in China

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:11.200
 and there's descriptions of it where this guy would see

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:14.560
 a fleet of sails coming when he looked over a mountain top

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.760
 in a field and what it was is that they used to put

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:19.400
 giant sails on their wheelbarrows and let the wind

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.160
 help them carry along.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:22.000
 - That's so clever.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.600
 - There are loads, yeah, it's amazing, isn't it?

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.080
 - Do you not the longest train ever was?

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.320
 - The longest train running at the moment,

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:29.640
 it's in someone's native country.

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:30.800
 - Who knows where Dan's from?

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:31.640
 - It's in Australia.

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:34.000
 - Oh it's in Australia, it's called the gun.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.280
 - G-H-A-N.

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:36.120
 - Gun?

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:36.960
 - Gun.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:40.240
 - So the Sunday service of the gun is 44 characters.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:43.040
 It's 0.7 miles long.

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.280
 - It's about a 15 minute walk.

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:45.760
 - How far does it travel?

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.440
 Is it like it only moves about two meters

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.640
 and then it's at the next station

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:50.440
 and you have to walk all the way up the train?

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:51.840
 - Yeah, so you even need to go.

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:52.880
 - Yeah, 15 minute walk is like,

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.600
 if you're at the wrong end of the buffet

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.120
 carriages at the back of the train,

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.360
 - Oh, if you're starving, that way.

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:01.000
 - But, so if you built a car that long,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.400
 that's impressive.

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:04.800
 But a train you're just adding carriages, right?

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:05.640
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:06.480
 - Is that impressive?

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:07.320
 - Yeah.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.120
 - Effectively that could be much longer

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:10.240
 if they just added more.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.240
 - There's two days freight trains

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.040
 that are like five, six kilometers long.

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.120
 - I was just, was this a passenger train?

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:14.960
 - This is a passenger train.

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:15.800
 - Yeah.

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.480
 - But you need platforms long enough.

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.440
 - That's the really, those are the unsung heroes

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.440
 of the operation people could pour in concrete

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:25.080
 for a year as a desert.

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.120
 - So where does it go to?

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.120
 - It goes across Australia.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.280
 - Right, so it's a proper...

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:29.480
 - Yeah, I think it goes all the way

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:30.560
 from the north coast to the south.

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:31.400
 - Wow.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:32.240
 - It's a huge long route.

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:33.080
 - Yeah, that's amazing.

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:33.920
 - So you'd need that.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:36.080
 You'd need that for a variety of fun.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:36.920
 - A variety of fun.

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:38.240
 - There's probably playrooms in there.

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.360
 There's probably a barbers.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.520
 There's probably a cinema.

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:41.360
 There's probably...

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.040
 - There's none of these things, the facts.

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.800
 (laughing)

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:50.080
 - I can't just make up what your fantasy big train would be.

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.880
 - A real conjecture.

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.720
 I'm never seen you look so angry, I don't know.

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:55.480
 - Someone's going to remember that.

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.880
 And remember it is genuine knowledge.

00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:58.960
 - I said probably.

00:16:58.960 --> 00:16:59.960
 - I know, but...

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.360
 - Yeah, I mean, that's, that in itself is problematic,

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:03.360
 saying probably.

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.200
 - Really?

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.040
 - Of the balancer.

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:05.880
 - Yeah.

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:07.640
 - And the probability says there will be one of them.

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:09.080
 - But it probably is.

00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:10.080
 (laughing)

00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:11.520
 - There possibly is.

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:12.800
 - There probably isn't.

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.240
 - I think there probably is.

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:16.080
 - You can't say there probably isn't.

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:18.160
 - There's a microscopically small chance

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.360
 that there are all of those things you just listed

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:22.560
 as far as we can go with this fact, I think.

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:25.000
 - Okay, this is really cool.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.920
 In Japan, they're now building new trains

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:29.480
 that are invisible.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:30.320
 - No, they're not.

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:31.320
 - No, they're not, come on.

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:32.680
 (laughing)

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.560
 - What they are is kind of invisible.

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:36.280
 They're sort of almost invisible.

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:39.000
 They've put this mirrored surface on the outside of it.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.840
 So it blends into its surroundings by reflecting.

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:44.240
 So if you're going through nature, for example,

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.720
 and you're surrounded by trees, blue sky, green grass,

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:49.080
 all that sort of stuff, if that's on the other side of it,

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.640
 that kind of mirrors off the side of the train.

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.120
 Therefore, oh, so you're not just going to see

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:55.280
 hundreds of passengers like sitting in there.

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:56.600
 - That's not that, yeah.

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:57.440
 - That's good.

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:59.480
 So if you're going on a nice countryside walk

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.520
 and your footpath crosses over a railway,

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.640
 then now you won't be able to see the train come towards you.

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:04.640
 - Yes, exactly.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:05.480
 - The chance I do.

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:06.760
 - You would just see yourself coming towards you

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:07.600
 at high speed.

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:08.600
 - Oh, that was nice.

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:09.600
 - You're like, what?

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.040
 And that guy is running fast.

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:11.880
 (laughing)

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.460
 (upbeat music)

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:19.640
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.440
 and that is Chuzinski.

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.760
 - My fact this week is that birds and cages

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.880
 hop in the direction they're meant to be migrating.

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:27.720
 - Wow.

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.360
 - That sounds very sad.

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:32.480
 - Do they do that only during migrating periods?

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:34.720
 - Yes, this is the amazing thing about it.

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.520
 If you've got a cage bird that's a migrating bird,

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:39.160
 then as soon as the time comes,

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.880
 when it would usually be migrating, first of all,

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.120
 it puts on all this body fat 'cause that's what birds do.

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:45.560
 So a lot of birds will double their body weight

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.600
 in preparation for big migrations.

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:49.280
 So it'll put on all this weight,

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:50.640
 and it'll get really, really restless

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:52.440
 and frisky and start flapping around the cage.

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.440
 And then when the migration period starts,

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:57.400
 it will then start moving towards the end of the cage

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.680
 that is in the direction of where it would be migrating.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:02.000
 And it will stop at exactly the time

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.800
 that it would have arrived at its destination.

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:04.640
 - Wow.

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:05.800
 - So perfectly timed.

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.320
 - But it's now fat.

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.160
 - Exactly.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.040
 - It'll double its weight and it can't burn the weight off.

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:11.720
 And there's not where it wants to be.

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:12.560
 - Yeah.

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:15.400
 - Just in terms of observation of that,

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.760
 you obviously see the bird hopping that way,

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.400
 but it will reach the end of the cage.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:20.640
 - Yeah, it's a good point, isn't it?

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.440
 - So it doesn't just hang by the end of the cage

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.280
 the whole time, right?

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.240
 Therefore, some people must observe the bird

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:26.840
 hopping the other way.

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:30.040
 - Yeah, so I think it will kind of maybe wander backwards a bit.

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.320
 This is actually not explained

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:32.880
 in a lot of the sources that reference it,

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:35.400
 but what it does do is it faces in that direction,

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.280
 it will try to flap towards that direction

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:39.720
 and then get rebounded off the cage, I guess.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.680
 And also what they do is they'll sit on their perch,

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.560
 facing the direction they're supposed to be going,

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.160
 and they'll flap their wings a lot,

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:46.800
 but stay motionless 'cause they realize

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:49.040
 they can't get out of the cage during migration.

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:49.880
 - That's extraordinary.

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:50.800
 - So they'll flush her about.

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.000
 - Do you know how they found out about this?

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.640
 Or one of the ways they found out about this

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:56.440
 is with a device called an emlin funnel.

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.280
 - Yeah.

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:58.120
 - This is a very cool thing.

00:19:58.120 --> 00:19:59.360
 So it's a plastic enclosure

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:02.360
 with a paper funnel leading out from the top of that.

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:06.040
 On the base of the funnel is ink pad.

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:07.800
 So you put the bird in there,

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:09.080
 you cover the top of the funnel.

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.560
 So it can't just fly out.

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:13.480
 And then you track the direction it moves in.

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:18.440
 And as it flaps, it leaves foot marks in the ink on the paper.

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.880
 So you can tell exactly the direction

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:21.040
 it's moving and flapping in.

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:22.400
 And they have at the surface,

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:26.560
 you can project different star constellations on the top

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:27.840
 to see if that has an effect,

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:29.400
 'cause sometimes they go magnetically,

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:30.560
 but sometimes they might do it

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:32.000
 by looking at the stars above them.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:32.840
 - That's horrible.

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:34.160
 That's like a dethruman show for birds.

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:35.000
 - It is, yeah.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 - Eventually they end up just writing messages

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.040
 in the ink saying, "Please God, somebody let me out."

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:40.560
 (laughing)

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:41.680
 Once they discovered this,

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:44.240
 then people realize you could do these brilliant experiments

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:46.560
 to work out what it was that causes birds to migrate

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:47.360
 in certain directions.

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:50.000
 So as you say, Andy, you could change the constellations

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.600
 to see if they navigated by that.

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:54.120
 You change the magnetic field around a bird's cage.

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:57.680
 So obviously they navigate by the magnetism of the earth.

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:59.320
 And so if you put a couple of magnets,

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:01.680
 you create a magnetic field around a bird cage

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:03.760
 and change the direction they think is north,

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.920
 they'll suddenly point in a different direction.

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.680
 - I heard on the radio the other day

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:11.000
 that whales that suddenly get lost in the ocean,

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.600
 they think it's actually down to solar flares

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.960
 because the solar flare is mess with the magnetism

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.760
 of the earth if you get hit by massive ones.

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.440
 So suddenly the whales would just be put

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.960
 on a different course and that's why groups of them

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:23.720
 have been, that's not a solid theory

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:25.320
 but because they just are trying to work out

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:28.600
 why seemingly healthy groups of whales get lost.

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:29.600
 - That's amazing.

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:32.640
 - Just one more thing related to this.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:35.000
 So there was this amazing experiment done recently

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.200
 into reed warblers that were picked up in Russia

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:41.040
 and was to work out exactly how much birds can tell

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:43.080
 if you change the magnetic field.

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:45.760
 So scientists went and they found some reed warblers in Russia

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:49.320
 and they created a magnetic field around their enclosure

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:51.800
 that mimicked conditions in Aberdeen.

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.040
 And the weird thing about this is that.

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:57.520
 - That's a distinctive magnetic flavor of Aberdeen.

00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:00.200
 Most of oil refineries that have been held

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.280
 in hard times recently.

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.320
 - Yeah, exactly, some weather spoons.

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:07.120
 So they did this but the weird thing was that Aberdeen

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:09.720
 is on roughly the same line of latitude.

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.560
 So the same distance from the equator

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:14.400
 as the place in Russia where they'd studied the birds.

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.560
 And so you would have thought that for them,

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:18.560
 if they're just testing the magnetic distance

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:21.080
 from the poles, they would think it was the same place

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:23.280
 but it turns out they can tell how far east or west

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:24.200
 they are as well.

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:28.000
 So what happened was all they did was change the magnetic field

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.440
 and the birds would usually point west

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:33.440
 'cause they were my great Europe, so south-west.

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:34.800
 And as soon as you change the field,

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:37.120
 the birds swiveled around and they pointed east

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:38.880
 knowing that they're in Aberdeen

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:41.520
 and they need to point in exactly a different direction

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:43.160
 in order to get where they're going to migrate to.

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:45.000
 - But they're very clever.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.280
 - That's very cool.

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:49.040
 It's so weird that we're missing this thing

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.960
 that all these animals have.

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:51.800
 - It's so annoying.

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:54.640
 - You've got nothing that even remotely makes us go,

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.920
 oh, I can relate to that, which is nothing.

00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:59.760
 There's no sense of magnetism's crazy.

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:02.880
 The thing you said about how birds put on loads of weight

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.120
 before they migrate so that they've got enough energy

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:07.640
 to get them through, it's amazing.

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:12.000
 Even their organs grow and shrink in this period.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.800
 So all the organs involved with feeding,

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.200
 like the stomach and the liver and the kidneys and so on,

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:20.440
 they get bigger to support the fueling process.

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:23.160
 But then during the take-off and migration,

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:26.480
 those organ shrink and then the heart and the flight muscles,

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.000
 they all grow.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.040
 - So it's a complete reconfiguration.

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:32.560
 They're changing the way the plane is built as they fly.

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:34.360
 - So cool.

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:35.760
 - That is amazing.

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:37.440
 That is awesome.

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.760
 - I should actually say the loads of what I'm saying

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:41.560
 comes from an episode of In Our Time,

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:44.000
 including the headline fact, which is on bird migration,

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:44.840
 which is brilliant.

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:46.360
 You should look it up, In Our Time is always good.

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:47.600
 - Yeah.

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.400
 - Yeah, when Planet Earth was coming out,

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:51.840
 the David Adamborough documentary,

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:54.640
 I was sat watching Alistair Fothergill,

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:59.520
 who is the program maker behind Blue Planet and Planet Earth.

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:02.960
 I went to a chat that he did of sort of talk at the BBC.

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.120
 And he was talking about his favorite moment,

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:08.960
 being the moment that the birds had to migrate over Everest.

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:11.880
 In order to migrate, they had to go over Mount Everest.

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:14.320
 And it took every ounce of their energy.

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:16.680
 - You get geese flying over Mount Everest.

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:17.520
 - Dee!

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:19.960
 - You've taken all your energy,

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:22.040
 just see a flock of geese flying over you.

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:25.440
 Are they using thermals or are they flying?

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:26.440
 They are flying.

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:27.960
 They never stop flapping their wings.

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:29.120
 They never glide.

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:30.520
 - They never glide?

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:31.360
 - They never glide.

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:32.640
 - It's so rough for us like that.

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:34.720
 - There's only, I think, what is it?

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:37.720
 A tenth of the oxygen you find at sea level.

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:39.080
 Obviously, when you're up that high,

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:40.720
 and they're still managing to fly all the time.

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:42.800
 - So they are panting presumably at that point?

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:45.720
 - We worked out that geese couldn't glide.

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:50.680
 Have we tried to make any ounce of stuff to dead goose

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:52.600
 and kind of do a glider?

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:55.280
 - What I mean is, like, do scientists

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:58.240
 knowing the makeup of a geese know they could do it?

00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:59.960
 They just haven't worked out to do it.

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.800
 - They just don't have the confidence.

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:03.320
 (laughing)

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:04.640
 'Cause presumably, if they're up there

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:07.280
 and their wings are, you know, they've got wings,

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:10.000
 surely just spreading them out, must buy them some glider.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.840
 - I think they're quite, I think creatures, they're quite,

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:12.680
 I don't know.

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:13.520
 I really don't know.

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:15.360
 - They wouldn't be able to, 'cause of evolution.

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:17.640
 - So the ones that try to fly, a long time ago.

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:19.160
 - The evolution of creation.

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:20.240
 - The evolution of creation.

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:21.240
 - The evolution of creation.

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:23.000
 - That's your answer every week.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 - There was ones that go just like you, Dad.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.400
 - She's always right, don't care.

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:27.440
 (laughing)

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:29.280
 - When is God gonna be the answer, ever?

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:30.520
 (laughing)

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:33.100
 (upbeat music)

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:38.120
 - Okay, there's time for our final fact of the show,

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:40.440
 and that is my fact.

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:43.280
 My fact is that each year,

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:46.640
 26 tons of clothing is left behind

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:49.080
 at the starting line of the Boston marathon.

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:53.040
 That is one ton for every mile of the marathon.

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:54.400
 - But why?

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.920
 I mean, why people, as people just taking off all their clothes

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:58.480
 when they get to the start of the marathon?

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.040
 - This is exactly what's happening.

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:02.320
 It's early in the morning, it's gonna be cold.

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:06.920
 So they bring long trackies, a zip up jacket or whatever,

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.160
 and then when the marathon starts,

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:09.920
 they take off the outer clothing

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:12.040
 so that they're in the classic marathon runner clothing.

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.800
 - And they just drop it where it is.

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:14.640
 - They just drop it where it is.

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:15.760
 - That's gonna be difficult if you're right

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:16.600
 at the back of the marathon.

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.800
 You've got a huge, like a horse jump to go.

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:20.520
 (laughing)

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:21.560
 - Yeah, a really good point.

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:23.440
 - Yeah, I think they chuck it to the side.

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:24.280
 - Okay.

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:25.840
 - This is an article that was written

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:28.960
 about a person in America called Judy Patasi,

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:31.640
 and Judy Patasi used to help marathon runners

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.280
 if they needed somewhere.

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:34.880
 Some coffee and some tea and stuff.

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:38.280
 It was just generally a helpful person, love the marathon.

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:40.240
 And for years, runners would be doing this,

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:41.720
 just taking off those bits of clothing,

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:42.800
 leaving them on the ground,

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:45.360
 and occasionally charities would come and collect some of them

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:46.800
 and bring them to charities.

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:48.640
 And in one year, no charities came.

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:51.240
 And they bagged up all the stuff and they threw it in the trash

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:52.720
 and that really infuriated her

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:53.920
 'cause she said this is such a waste.

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:55.240
 So she's made it her mission

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:57.200
 to now collect all of these clothes.

00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:00.760
 And to begin with, it wasn't as much as 26 tons.

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:01.720
 It was even less.

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:02.880
 It changes all the time.

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:05.680
 The latest article, the article I'm specifically getting it from,

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:07.880
 it was 26 that they managed to collect.

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:10.040
 Obviously it varies year by year.

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:14.160
 The exact quote from her is now I have 201 volunteers.

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:16.880
 We cover all the way to Ashland Townline

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:19.560
 and we've gotten up to 52,000 pounds,

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:22.240
 which is the equivalent of 26 tons.

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:23.320
 That is amazing.

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:25.400
 And the reason it's gone up dramatically

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:27.280
 is because there used to be a bus service

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:29.240
 right at the end of the Boston marathon

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.760
 that would bring you back to the start

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:32.560
 so people could collect their clothes

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:34.360
 but they canceled the bus service.

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:36.360
 So now all of these clothes, people just go,

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:38.160
 what do you know, we'll just leave it there.

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:39.320
 So they now collect these all

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:41.680
 and they give them to charities and raise so much money.

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:42.480
 But yeah.

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:43.960
 There must be an awareness thing as well though.

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:45.800
 If you run, you know what's going to happen to the clothes

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:47.560
 so you think, well, I'm just going to bring loads of clothes

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:48.400
 and stuff.

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:49.240
 I would hope so, because--

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:51.120
 Hey, I can't believe running a marathon is hard enough

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:52.600
 without having to admit to yourself

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:55.920
 that you have to lose an entire outfit in the process.

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:57.920
 And also, I'm the kind of unlikable person

00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:00.320
 who would definitely throw my clothes aside,

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:01.760
 bear in mind where I'd thrown them

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:03.880
 and then walk back a bit later to pick them up.

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:06.160
 And I'd be pretty irritated if they'd been sent to South

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.640
 who'd down by that point.

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.440
 So there's a thing about the Boston Marathon

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:11.640
 which is that it's for--

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.040
 it's for very good runners as in.

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:14.800
 Obviously, all marathons are for very good runners.

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:18.360
 But only the fastest amateurs get in and qualify

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:19.440
 for the Boston Marathon.

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:22.480
 So there is a guy, his name is Derek Murphy.

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:23.760
 He's an American man.

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:26.680
 And he is a marathon enthusiast.

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:30.320
 And he's made it his life's work to spot people cheating

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:32.960
 in marathons from hundreds of miles away.

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:34.600
 Hundreds of miles away.

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:36.240
 Yeah, he's got this incredible telescope.

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:41.000
 But it's only 26 miles.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.280
 Who's some really elaborate cheating going on?

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:46.560
 When you run the other way around the world, yes.

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:48.480
 So the BBC did a profile of him.

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.560
 He has this blog called Marathon Investigation.

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:52.600
 And he started wondering whether people

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:54.880
 cheat to get to qualify for the Boston Marathon.

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:57.280
 They'll run another marathon, which you have to do.

00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:59.520
 And he looks at suspiciously fast times.

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:02.120
 And he looks at photos taken during the race

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:03.680
 to see if he can track people down.

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:06.800
 So he's caught people who've used other people's bib numbers,

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:09.760
 or he's caught people who've perhaps missed out stages

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:10.600
 throughout.

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:12.760
 But he has also vindicated at least one person,

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:15.120
 where the authorities thought that runner was cheating.

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.960
 And he managed to find the evidence to say,

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.320
 no, I don't think his person was cheating, isn't it?

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:20.440
 Why is he--

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:23.400
 I mean, I really support vigilante justice

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:26.160
 in certain cases, I suppose.

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:29.920
 But is this a major problem in morality and crime?

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:33.440
 If you support Batman, you should support this guy.

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:34.680
 That's what I'm saying.

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:35.680
 This is like--

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:37.560
 And actually, the downgrade the Batman

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:40.520
 would have to take to be doing that.

00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:43.520
 So in 1980, there was a woman called Rosie Ruiz,

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:46.880
 who was declared the winner of the marathon.

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.240
 But then it was later found out that she

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:50.320
 had taken the subway for part of the way, frowned on.

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:52.000
 Yeah, this is frowned on.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.840
 Can't if no one noticed her ducking out of the marathon,

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:56.800
 popping into a subway station, and then--

00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:58.640
 But you probably think someone was ducking out

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:00.480
 just to get themselves the drink or--

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:02.840
 Or ducking out altogether, being like, actually,

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:03.520
 this is not for me.

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:05.560
 And it can't be lined all the way, can it?

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:07.920
 It's in 1980 as well, maybe it was just less organized.

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:10.160
 But I think the suspicious bit is when you come out of the subway

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:10.960
 and join the race.

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:11.840
 That's the crucial--

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:13.240
 That's true, yeah.

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:16.360
 I read about it, lady, because you can go off trail.

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:20.360
 A Florida woman who became lost during a half marathon

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:22.560
 when she just took the wrong corner.

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:24.520
 So she was found nearly 12 hours later

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:28.440
 in the middle of a 25,000 acre park just completely lost.

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:29.400
 Oh, no.

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:33.480
 At what point do you think you stop running?

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:34.760
 At what point is it obvious to you

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:37.760
 that you're now no longer running the marathon?

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:39.120
 Yes, yeah.

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:42.760
 Do you think she just thought she was way ahead?

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:45.120
 I didn't know that you have to wear it

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:47.280
 that one of those bibs when you run a marathon.

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:47.800
 Yeah.

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:49.520
 They have trackers in them, and they

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:52.440
 have mats across the marathon course,

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:56.600
 which electronically log you making particular checkpoints

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:57.480
 along the way.

00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:58.600
 That is not made, you sure?

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:00.400
 Anyone who's ever run a marathon knows that,

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:01.320
 but I had no idea.

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:03.800
 That's like in a computer game when you get hit checkpoints.

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:04.760
 Exactly, yeah.

00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:07.640
 And so sometimes that's the way of identifying cheaters

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:09.800
 if the bib missed out several checkpoints.

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:11.040
 Yeah, yeah.

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:14.960
 So another cheater was a woman called Catherine Swiser,

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:16.800
 who-- so maybe your guy with a telescope

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:18.120
 might want to get onto her.

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:22.760
 She was a woman, and she tried to run the marathon in 1967.

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:24.760
 And she registered with just her initials,

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:26.440
 so it was gender neutral, so it wasn't

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:27.600
 known that she was a woman.

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.120
 And she ran the marathon.

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:31.800
 And people were quite supportive in the crowds,

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.120
 but then Jock Semple, who was a race official,

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:35.920
 was really against the idea of women running.

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:37.840
 People thought women were way too fragile.

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:40.880
 It kind of muddied the masculinity of the sport for men.

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:44.760
 And so he stormed onto the track and tried to drag her off it,

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:47.320
 at which point her boyfriend came and kind of defended

00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:48.840
 her, which is a little bit annoying

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:50.640
 from the feminist perspective, but her boyfriend

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:52.680
 came on and pushed Jock Semple out the way.

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:53.920
 And she finished.

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:56.360
 And the nice thing about her is that this year

00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:58.720
 was the 50th anniversary of when she did that,

00:31:58.720 --> 00:31:59.640
 and she ran it again.

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:00.640
 Great.

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:01.240
 How was she?

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:02.440
 She wasn't a cheater, though.

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:03.120
 Was she?

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:05.240
 Yeah, she cheated by pretending to be a man.

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:05.720
 OK.

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:07.360
 Technically speaking, she wasn't allowed to enter.

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:08.200
 Yes, right.

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:08.960
 Yeah.

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:09.640
 I guess so.

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:12.600
 She's the bad guy in this story, anyway.

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:15.240
 The furthest away, I guess, that the marathon

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:16.520
 has ever been run off the course,

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:19.000
 since we were talking about that, is Sunita Williams,

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.720
 who's a NASA astronaut, and she ran it

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:22.720
 while she was on the International Space Station,

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:23.880
 on the treadmill.

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:25.880
 So someone argue she was going way faster than anyone

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:28.680
 asking, she was coaching me, yeah, for the very time.

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:29.960
 There's a thing about the Berlin marathon,

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:33.440
 which is that loads of records get broken on that marathon course

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:35.320
 and not, for example, on the London one,

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:37.520
 or the Kuala Lumpur one, or the Boston one.

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:38.960
 And there are all these reasons which

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:41.280
 combine to make Berlin one of the best places

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:42.840
 to break a speed record.

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:44.720
 So it's really flat.

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:46.200
 There are very few corners.

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:48.840
 It's never more than 53 meters above sea level.

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:50.240
 So lots of lovely oxygen.

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:52.160
 And it's in September, which is quite a good time of year,

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:53.400
 because the weather's not crazy.

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:54.800
 And it's mostly on asphalt.

00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:57.320
 And so there are all of these different combination

00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:00.480
 factors that conspire to make it a great best record.

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:02.800
 Whereas Boston, the Boston marathon course,

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:05.960
 the finish line is so much lower than the starting line

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:08.640
 that it is ineligible for world record attempts.

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:09.640
 - No way. - Yeah.

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:10.840
 Because you're running downhill, basically,

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:12.320
 you're running downhill.

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:14.520
 - Wow. - No way.

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:15.840
 - Why don't they just move it then?

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:16.680
 I don't know.

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:17.520
 I'll put it the other way around.

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:20.320
 - Put it the other way around.

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:21.480
 - Record breaking in the Boston marathon

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:22.320
 is a quite interesting thing.

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:24.720
 So in 2010, a guy broke the world

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:25.760
 record for Boston Marta.

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:28.760
 His name was Robert K. Chirio from Kenya.

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:31.560
 But he broke the record that was set previously

00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:34.280
 by a man also named Robert K. Chirio

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:35.840
 by complete coincidence, no relation.

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:36.920
 - No relation. - No relation.

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:37.760
 - So weird, right?

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:41.400
 He must have changed his name to, no, no.

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:43.840
 I mean, I suppose you may be to more common,

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:46.720
 maybe it's a bit like a John Smith for your name or something,

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:48.680
 but that's amazing.

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:51.600
 - So the first African person to win the Boston marathon

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:53.280
 won it in 1988.

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:55.560
 I guess probably because logistics got easier

00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:58.080
 for people to enter at that point, maybe from abroad.

00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:00.600
 So 1988 was the first African person to win it.

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:02.680
 It was Ibrahim Hussein from Kenya.

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:05.400
 Since then, there have only been three winners

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:07.280
 who haven't been Kenya or Ethiopia.

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:09.880
 (laughing)

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:10.920
 He'll just win.

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:13.440
 Oh, we're actually much better at this than these guys.

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:14.680
 (laughing)

00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:17.260
 (upbeat music)

00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:21.000
 - Okay, that is it.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.200
 That is all of our facts.

00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:23.760
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.520
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:26.840

 we can be found on our Twitter accounts.

00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:31.760

 - Yep, or you can go to our website.

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:41.640
 No such thing as a fish.com.

00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:43.320
 We have links to the tour that we're doing

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:44.160
 at the end of this year.

00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:46.680
 We have a link to the book that's coming out in November.

00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:49.240
 And you can find every single episode

00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:50.800
 we've ever done up there too.

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.480
 Okay, we'll be back again next week with another episode.

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:54.400
 We'll see you then.

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:55.240
 Goodbye.

00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:57.840
 (upbeat music)

00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:00.420
 (upbeat music)

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:10.420
