00:00:00,00:00:02,"- Hey guys, welcome to this week's episode"
00:00:02,00:00:03,and no such thing as a fish.
00:00:03,00:00:06,"Before we begin, we have an announcement to make."
00:00:06,00:00:08,- What's the announcement then?
00:00:08,00:00:10,- The announcement is that we're doing a live show.
00:00:10,00:00:11,- Get out of here.
00:00:11,00:00:12,"- Yeah, at a book festival."
00:00:12,00:00:13,- No.
00:00:13,00:00:15,"- Yeah, Cheltenham Book Festival, we're so excited."
00:00:15,00:00:18,It is in Cheltenham.
00:00:18,00:00:19,"- It's in Cheltenham, nice."
00:00:19,00:00:23,"- It's on the 11th of October, it's at 6 p.m."
00:00:23,00:00:25,We're doing it because we're releasing our book in November
00:00:25,00:00:28,and this is gonna be the first ever event
00:00:28,00:00:30,where we bring our book to.
00:00:30,00:00:32,"We're not gonna have the physical book with us,"
00:00:32,00:00:33,it's not publish yet.
00:00:33,00:00:34,"- We're gonna have our heads because we've written it,"
00:00:34,00:00:35,we know it.
00:00:35,00:00:36,- Exactly.
00:00:36,00:00:38,"- So the whole event is gonna be a live podcast,"
00:00:38,00:00:40,we're gonna take our facts from the upcoming book
00:00:40,00:00:42,and we're gonna do a Q and A afterwards
00:00:42,00:00:45,"and it's gonna be awesome, it's a legit book festival."
00:00:45,00:00:47,- It'll be really fun if you've never been to our live shows.
00:00:47,00:00:51,So go to qi.com/fishevents to get tickets for that
00:00:51,00:00:53,"or you can just look on the Cheltenham Festival website,"
00:00:53,00:00:55,11th of October.
00:00:55,00:00:56,- So I get a qi.com/fishevents.
00:00:56,00:00:57,- That's correct.
00:00:57,00:00:58,- That's correct.
00:00:58,00:00:59,- Yeah.
00:00:59,00:01:00,- Do you write that down?
00:01:00,00:01:01,- Do you write that down?
00:01:01,00:01:02,- Do you write that down?
00:01:02,00:01:03,- How do you spell qi?
00:01:03,00:01:05,"- Okay, on with this week's show."
00:01:05,00:01:07,(upbeat music)
00:01:07,00:01:11,(speaking in foreign language)
00:01:11,00:01:22,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:01:22,00:01:25,"of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast"
00:01:25,00:01:26,coming to you from the QI offices
00:01:26,00:01:28,in Covenant Garden.
00:01:28,00:01:30,My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here
00:01:30,00:01:34,"with Andrew Hunter-Mari, Anacizansky, and Alex Bell."
00:01:34,00:01:36,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:01:36,00:01:39,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:01:39,00:01:42,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:01:42,00:01:44,"Starting with you, Andy."
00:01:44,00:01:46,"- My fact is that the original director of ""Jaws"""
00:01:46,00:01:49,was a man called Richard Richards who was fired
00:01:49,00:01:52,because he kept referring to the shark as a whale.
00:01:52,00:01:54,(laughing)
00:01:54,00:01:55,- So he did not read the script?
00:01:55,00:01:57,"- I don't know if he had read it or not,"
00:01:57,00:01:59,"but he had, he definitely had."
00:01:59,00:02:00,(laughing)
00:02:00,00:02:02,"He had because when you say he kept referring to it,"
00:02:02,00:02:04,it wasn't even like loosely in conversation.
00:02:04,00:02:07,He was in a meeting with the producers.
00:02:07,00:02:09,He'd ridden a treatment where all the way through
00:02:09,00:02:11,"the treatment, he kept saying, ""And then the whale."""
00:02:11,00:02:13,(laughing)
00:02:13,00:02:15,"- Yeah, the producers have got the rights"
00:02:15,00:02:18,"to turn the novel ""Jaws"" into the film"
00:02:18,00:02:21,and they took him for lunch and they decided to let him go.
00:02:21,00:02:23,- And then they gave it to Spielberg.
00:02:23,00:02:24,"- That's right, yeah."
00:02:24,00:02:26,- Here's a classic bit of trivia
00:02:26,00:02:29,"that I bet everyone who knows ""Jaws"" knows."
00:02:29,00:02:32,"But again, I didn't know that this shark has a name."
00:02:32,00:02:33,- Oh yeah. - I am.
00:02:33,00:02:35,"- Not in the movie, just on set."
00:02:35,00:02:36,(laughing)
00:02:36,00:02:37,So like we know on the back of his seat.
00:02:37,00:02:40,(laughing)
00:02:40,00:02:45,"- Actors and directors, which was Bruce."
00:02:45,00:02:47,- Wasn't he named after Steven Spielberg Gloya?
00:02:47,00:02:47,"- That's right, yeah."
00:02:47,00:02:51,He was named after his lawyer who was called Bruce Raynor
00:02:51,00:02:54,and Bruce became the name of the shark on the set.
00:02:54,00:02:57,"- Bruce is quite a good name though, isn't it, for a shark?"
00:02:57,00:02:58,There's something about it.
00:02:58,00:03:00,I know it's an Australian sounding name.
00:03:00,00:03:01,I think a shark's being Australian.
00:03:01,00:03:03,"- It's the name, you know how you're making that connection."
00:03:03,00:03:05,It's the name of the shark and finding Nemo.
00:03:05,00:03:07,- Oh.
00:03:07,00:03:08,- That must be a nod to that.
00:03:08,00:03:10,"- It must be, absolutely."
00:03:10,00:03:11,"- Well, it's a good thing they didn't give it"
00:03:11,00:03:12,"the other nickname that it had on set,"
00:03:12,00:03:14,which was the great white turd.
00:03:14,00:03:15,- Yeah.
00:03:15,00:03:17,"- And also flaws, because they were never worked."
00:03:17,00:03:18,"- Yeah, which I like."
00:03:18,00:03:20,- Spielberg basically rewrote the movie a bit
00:03:20,00:03:23,because they couldn't get the shark to work.
00:03:23,00:03:25,It was such a bad mechanical shark.
00:03:25,00:03:26,"Which is, I mean, you know, if you're filming"
00:03:26,00:03:29,"anything mechanical in saltwater, it's gonna be difficult."
00:03:29,00:03:30,- Yeah.
00:03:30,00:03:32,- So they made three mechanical sharks
00:03:32,00:03:33,so that they could film it from different angles
00:03:33,00:03:35,with different bits.
00:03:35,00:03:38,There had to be 16 people on a nearby floating barge
00:03:38,00:03:40,operating different bits of the shark.
00:03:40,00:03:41,- 'Cause the whole thing was pneumatic.
00:03:41,00:03:43,They had loads of nodes of piped operate
00:03:43,00:03:44,because they had motors which all broke.
00:03:44,00:03:46,"So they had to put pneumatic tubes in to make it work,"
00:03:46,00:03:48,"which meant they had to have a huge, like,"
00:03:48,00:03:49,operating station which was quite off-scaling.
00:03:49,00:03:50,- I know.
00:03:50,00:03:54,- So they compared it to an orchestra in an article I read.
00:03:54,00:03:56,So they all had to be doing the right things.
00:03:56,00:03:58,All 16 people at the right time.
00:03:58,00:03:59,So it all works properly.
00:03:59,00:04:01,And sometimes there would be a bit where 15 people
00:04:01,00:04:03,got a right and the shark comes out of the water
00:04:03,00:04:04,as you're filming.
00:04:04,00:04:06,But then it's mechanical eyes are shut.
00:04:06,00:04:07,"- Oh, yeah."
00:04:07,00:04:09,- So then you have to go back and do it again.
00:04:09,00:04:11,And then something else won't be working right
00:04:11,00:04:12,or one of the fins will be whacking me.
00:04:12,00:04:14,- Are they given it mechanical eyelids?
00:04:14,00:04:16,(laughing)
00:04:16,00:04:17,- It was the eyelids.
00:04:17,00:04:18,"- It is George, ever blink."
00:04:18,00:04:19,We need to rewatch that film.
00:04:19,00:04:21,- It's not a classic moment.
00:04:21,00:04:24,There's no one I wink that he give to the camera
00:04:24,00:04:26,just before he eats some of it.
00:04:26,00:04:29,"- They wanted, actually, the producers asked Spielberg"
00:04:29,00:04:32,"to train a great white shark initially for the film, yeah."
00:04:32,00:04:33,- That is so hollywood.
00:04:33,00:04:33,- Yeah.
00:04:33,00:04:35,(laughing)
00:04:35,00:04:37,- Turns out you can't do that.
00:04:37,00:04:38,(laughing)
00:04:38,00:04:40,- That is amazing.
00:04:40,00:04:41,- He moved on to this.
00:04:41,00:04:42,Did you know that for some of the shots
00:04:42,00:04:45,"in order to make the shark look bigger,"
00:04:45,00:04:47,they used a body double for the guy who placed
00:04:47,00:04:48,the main character.
00:04:48,00:04:52,"And they used a jockey, 'cause he was really small."
00:04:52,00:04:56,So they used a 4 foot 9x jockey to be in a in the shark tank
00:04:56,00:04:57,just to make it look that bit bigger.
00:04:57,00:04:59,- That's a bit like I know all these films
00:04:59,00:05:00,like in Casablanca.
00:05:00,00:05:01,They had small people wandering around
00:05:01,00:05:04,the cutout of the plane in that famous last scene
00:05:04,00:05:06,"in the background, 'cause it makes the plane look bigger,"
00:05:06,00:05:07,so they had to have a bigger cutout.
00:05:07,00:05:08,It was like that.
00:05:08,00:05:10,"All sorts of like, perspective, gags like that."
00:05:10,00:05:12,"- Did you know one of the main problems with jaws,"
00:05:12,00:05:14,the mechanical one?
00:05:14,00:05:15,It's the jaws.
00:05:15,00:05:18,The jaws are not right in the jaws of the thing.
00:05:18,00:05:21,They're not right for a shark or they just wouldn't work.
00:05:21,00:05:22,- They're not right for a shark.
00:05:22,00:05:23,"I'm sure they wouldn't work at various points,"
00:05:23,00:05:24,but this is really interesting.
00:05:24,00:05:26,Think great white sharks have a much weaker bite
00:05:26,00:05:28,than you might suspect.
00:05:28,00:05:30,They're not weak.
00:05:30,00:05:31,"No one's saying they're weak,"
00:05:31,00:05:34,but their jaws aren't attached to their head properly.
00:05:34,00:05:37,So they operate with a separate muscle.
00:05:37,00:05:39,And what that means is what they can do
00:05:39,00:05:41,is approach you in the water
00:05:41,00:05:44,"and give you a test bite, which is soft."
00:05:44,00:05:45,And then if they like the taste of you
00:05:45,00:05:46,"and they think you'd be good,"
00:05:46,00:05:48,they come back for a kill bite.
00:05:48,00:05:51,So loads of people who have had a time
00:05:51,00:05:52,with a great white shark and escaped
00:05:52,00:05:55,"have probably been given a test bite,"
00:05:55,00:05:56,"which is still serious and you can still bleed to death,"
00:05:56,00:05:59,"obviously, but they haven't been given the full kill bite."
00:05:59,00:06:00,- I do that with food.
00:06:00,00:06:01,"- It's really weird, I like it."
00:06:01,00:06:03,(all laughing)
00:06:03,00:06:04,- It's not kind of a restaurant with you.
00:06:04,00:06:06,(all laughing)
00:06:06,00:06:09,'Cause then you walk off around the restaurant
00:06:09,00:06:11,once you're given a test bite.
00:06:11,00:06:12,(all laughing)
00:06:12,00:06:14,"But the jaws obviously on the mechanical shark,"
00:06:14,00:06:16,they don't have those two gradations.
00:06:16,00:06:19,So it's just a massive hinge and it's just not shithaway.
00:06:19,00:06:20,"- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
00:06:20,00:06:22,- So why do they do the test bite?
00:06:22,00:06:24,Why don't they just go in with the big bites
00:06:24,00:06:25,to say the energy or something?
00:06:25,00:06:27,"- Well, they might not like what they eat, you know?"
00:06:27,00:06:30,"They might find, oh, it's all full of bone."
00:06:30,00:06:31,I don't want to eat the bone.
00:06:31,00:06:33,"They might say, oh, go off and find a seal to eat and stay"
00:06:33,00:06:34,'cause they're all blubber and delicious.
00:06:34,00:06:35,"- I guess when you've got a mouth out big,"
00:06:35,00:06:37,"you're kind of committing when you're biting something,"
00:06:37,00:06:38,you've got to do something with it.
00:06:38,00:06:40,- What if there's a tree floating in the water
00:06:40,00:06:40,and you make a mistake?
00:06:40,00:06:42,"If you go in for a massive kill bite,"
00:06:42,00:06:46,"you'll feel like an idiot. - Yeah, whereas if you give it a quick test,"
00:06:46,00:06:48,"no, that's a tree, I knew it was a tree."
00:06:48,00:06:49,- So here's something interesting.
00:06:49,00:06:54,"When they first put the shark into salt water, it sank."
00:06:54,00:06:55,"So when they were going to film,"
00:06:55,00:06:58,"and they had to retrieve it from the bottom of Martha's Vineyard,"
00:06:58,00:07:00,and it's because it was salt water
00:07:00,00:07:04,"and they don't ever attest it is in freshwater,"
00:07:04,00:07:05,which they were expecting that it was going to work
00:07:05,00:07:07,"like it did in freshwater, but then it sank to the bottom,"
00:07:07,00:07:11,which is the exact opposite of how a real shark would work.
00:07:11,00:07:13,And do you remember I mentioned this a few episodes
00:07:13,00:07:16,"go on the podcast, they don't have a swim bladder,"
00:07:16,00:07:19,and so they don't often go into freshwater
00:07:19,00:07:22,"because it doesn't work there, so they'll sink in freshwater."
00:07:22,00:07:26,"- But I don't understand, so obviously salty water is more buoyant,"
00:07:26,00:07:28,and so I don't understand what would sink
00:07:28,00:07:30,in salt water that wouldn't sink in freshwater.
00:07:30,00:07:31,- No one does.
00:07:31,00:07:33,- I don't think this is one of those universal mysteries.
00:07:33,00:07:35,(laughing)
00:07:35,00:07:37,"- No one does, but which I mean, I don't know."
00:07:37,00:07:39,(laughing)
00:07:39,00:07:41,- I've got something so bizarre that I found out.
00:07:41,00:07:41,- Yeah.
00:07:41,00:07:44,"- Of course of this, which is that it is related,"
00:07:44,00:07:45,but you're not going to get know why initially.
00:07:45,00:07:50,"So polygraph tests are sold very often across the US,"
00:07:50,00:07:53,like you can sell your polygraph testing services
00:07:53,00:07:56,"for various reasons, and all the websites"
00:07:56,00:08:00,"that advertise polygraph tests say you can use these four,"
00:08:00,00:08:02,and then there's list of the main things you use them for.
00:08:02,00:08:07,"So for theft, arson, murder, robbery, infidelity, assault,"
00:08:07,00:08:10,"and fishing tournaments, and it turns out,"
00:08:10,00:08:13,"so I learned this looking at these sharp catching tournaments,"
00:08:13,00:08:14,"and the idea is that you go,"
00:08:14,00:08:16,"and you have to catch the biggest shark that you possibly can,"
00:08:16,00:08:19,and one of the main uses of polygraph tests
00:08:19,00:08:22,is having lie detector tests after these tournaments
00:08:22,00:08:23,to check the people haven't cheated.
00:08:23,00:08:24,- No.
00:08:24,00:08:26,"- Yeah, this is what, and it's on all these lie detector websites,"
00:08:26,00:08:29,"they're like, yeah, murder, arson, cheating wives,"
00:08:29,00:08:32,"fishing tournament, obviously."
00:08:32,00:08:33,- Cheating the shark as you can.
00:08:33,00:08:34,- Because.
00:08:34,00:08:36,"- No, what you do is there are shark sales people"
00:08:36,00:08:38,who collect large sharks around the year
00:08:38,00:08:39,"and keep them alive,"
00:08:39,00:08:41,and then they flog them to people who've entered the tournaments
00:08:41,00:08:43,"on the slide, so you go buy a shark."
00:08:43,00:08:46,- So you go live at the tour of it with a giant shark
00:08:46,00:08:51,"in your bag, get on a boat and let the slowly lower it"
00:08:51,00:08:52,on your jacket.
00:08:52,00:08:52,(laughing)
00:08:52,00:08:55,- That's why bag searches originally come from sharks.
00:08:55,00:08:56,- Right.
00:08:56,00:08:59,"- The guy, who's the guy here at the original book,"
00:08:59,00:09:00,he really regressed it.
00:09:00,00:09:01,- Bentley.
00:09:01,00:09:02,- Bentley.
00:09:02,00:09:03,"- Yeah, so Peter Bentley regretted the fact"
00:09:03,00:09:06,"that sharks have vilified via jaws,"
00:09:06,00:09:09,and suddenly it's set off this spate of shark hunting
00:09:09,00:09:11,"and shark murdering expeditions,"
00:09:11,00:09:14,and shark populations in America were reduced by it
00:09:14,00:09:16,"up to 50% some people say,"
00:09:16,00:09:18,"not just because of shark hunting,"
00:09:18,00:09:20,"but that was a huge thing and it still happens today,"
00:09:20,00:09:23,"these shark hunting tournaments,"
00:09:23,00:09:25,caused by the fact that it created this bad reputation
00:09:25,00:09:28,for sharks who obviously only kill about one person
00:09:28,00:09:29,"every two years,"
00:09:29,00:09:32,whereas we kill hundreds of thousands of them every year.
00:09:32,00:09:34,- I think it's something like a hundred million sharks
00:09:34,00:09:35,per year that once kill.
00:09:35,00:09:36,- What?
00:09:36,00:09:37,"- Yeah, it's huge."
00:09:37,00:09:38,- It's a massive number.
00:09:38,00:09:39,- This is about great fact about how
00:09:39,00:09:42,vending machines kill twice as many humans as sharks do.
00:09:42,00:09:42,- Yeah.
00:09:42,00:09:43,- Mm.
00:09:43,00:09:46,"- But if we had a shark in the corridor at the school,"
00:09:46,00:09:48,I think the figures might start creeping up.
00:09:48,00:09:50,(laughing)
00:09:50,00:09:52,- If you could only get a twix by reaching
00:09:52,00:09:53,into the mouth of a shark.
00:09:53,00:09:56,(laughing)
00:09:56,00:09:58,(upbeat music)
00:09:58,00:10:03,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two,"
00:10:03,00:10:04,and that is Alex.
00:10:04,00:10:07,"My fact this week is that until the 1960s,"
00:10:07,00:10:10,high speed trains in Britain would drop carriages
00:10:10,00:10:13,off at stations that they weren't stopping at.
00:10:13,00:10:15,- So your train is going along?
00:10:15,00:10:16,- Yeah.
00:10:16,00:10:17,- And then all the people in the back
00:10:17,00:10:19,"carriage wanted to get off at the next stop,"
00:10:19,00:10:20,but the train's not stopping.
00:10:20,00:10:21,"- There's a high speed train, yeah."
00:10:21,00:10:22,- It's a high speed train.
00:10:22,00:10:24,So you have to run into the back carriage
00:10:24,00:10:26,and then they just cut it off.
00:10:26,00:10:27,"- Yeah, I don't think everyone would,"
00:10:27,00:10:29,I think I would get in and sit at the back carriage
00:10:29,00:10:31,but you wouldn't just like run and jump
00:10:31,00:10:33,as the carriage is not leaving the train.
00:10:33,00:10:34,"But they would uncouple the trainers,"
00:10:34,00:10:35,"they were approaching the station,"
00:10:35,00:10:38,"and there would be a guard in that carriage with a brake,"
00:10:38,00:10:41,and then the carriage would just roll to a stop at station
00:10:41,00:10:43,which meant that anyone who wanted to get off
00:10:43,00:10:43,"at that station could,"
00:10:43,00:10:45,but it wouldn't slow down the train.
00:10:45,00:10:47,So what would they do with then the carriage?
00:10:47,00:10:48,"Oh, this is the clever bit"
00:10:48,00:10:49,because the carriages would then be picked up
00:10:49,00:10:51,by the next slow train that was coming through.
00:10:51,00:10:54,So the slow trains would actually get carriages added on.
00:10:54,00:10:55,- Why is it only high speed trains?
00:10:55,00:10:57,It seems like they're the most difficult trains
00:10:57,00:10:59,to accurately drop of a carriage at a station.
00:10:59,00:11:01,- I don't think the high speed trains are going faster
00:11:01,00:11:02,than the actual trains.
00:11:02,00:11:04,"- It's high speed is in express trains,"
00:11:04,00:11:05,they're not stopping at the station.
00:11:05,00:11:07,That's what's excellent when you stop at every station.
00:11:07,00:11:09,- So when do they stop doing this?
00:11:09,00:11:10,"- Well, they did it for like 40, 50 years"
00:11:10,00:11:12,and then finished in the 1960s.
00:11:12,00:11:14,And now the replacement service is when you get on a train
00:11:14,00:11:16,"and it splits in two parts,"
00:11:16,00:11:17,when you get to a certain station.
00:11:17,00:11:18,- So that's what it looks like.
00:11:18,00:11:19,- That's so cool.
00:11:19,00:11:22,So like in theory our grandparents should remember that.
00:11:22,00:11:23,"- Yeah, if they lived in England, you know,"
00:11:23,00:11:26,they might have been on one of the jettisoned.
00:11:26,00:11:27,"- It was a pretty common thing. - Trains, wow."
00:11:27,00:11:29,"- Another thing you could do until the 1970s,"
00:11:29,00:11:32,"so this is from 1889 to the 1970s,"
00:11:32,00:11:35,anyone on the train could cause the train to break.
00:11:35,00:11:37,"And this still happens in trains around the world,"
00:11:37,00:11:38,quite a bit. - Yeah.
00:11:38,00:11:41,- But now I think the driver has an override button.
00:11:41,00:11:42,"So, but I didn't realize this,"
00:11:42,00:11:45,"there was a cord that ran all the way from,"
00:11:45,00:11:46,"you know, where the driver's sitting"
00:11:46,00:11:47,"and where the brakes are,"
00:11:47,00:11:49,all the way along the roof to the back of the train
00:11:49,00:11:52,and a little cord drops down each carriage and you pull it.
00:11:52,00:11:55,But what you have now is you pull the cord
00:11:55,00:11:57,and the driver has three seconds to decide
00:11:57,00:11:58,whether to override it.
00:11:58,00:12:01,"So if the driver sees the cord's been pulled,"
00:12:01,00:12:04,"he's got three seconds to make a crucial decision of,"
00:12:04,00:12:06,is it worth stopping for this emergency?
00:12:06,00:12:08,I don't know what this emergency is probably
00:12:08,00:12:10,'cause a passenger's done it and I can't see it.
00:12:10,00:12:13,"- Yeah, but what kind of information can he get"
00:12:13,00:12:14,in those three seconds? - Yeah.
00:12:14,00:12:15,"- How does that help? - Well, exactly."
00:12:15,00:12:17,I don't know. - Maybe he's running late.
00:12:17,00:12:19,And he thinks it can't be that bad.
00:12:19,00:12:22,- But maybe things were coming into a station in a minute.
00:12:22,00:12:24,"So let's speed it better. - Yeah, that's true."
00:12:24,00:12:25,- Maybe that's it.
00:12:25,00:12:28,- He has got a communication line
00:12:28,00:12:29,with the passengers pulled the cord as well.
00:12:29,00:12:31,"So he can't just shout, ""Wink, wink, wink, wink."""
00:12:31,00:12:32,What's going on? What's going on?
00:12:32,00:12:33,You wouldn't have time.
00:12:33,00:12:36,"Three seconds is all enough. - No, look at that."
00:12:36,00:12:36,- I don't know. - I don't know.
00:12:36,00:12:38,Most of my conversations with my father
00:12:38,00:12:41,"are about three seconds, and we say everything we need to."
00:12:41,00:12:42,(laughing)
00:12:42,00:12:45,"Yeah, I was on a train to Edinburgh not too long ago"
00:12:45,00:12:48,"and in the bathroom, just above the toilet,"
00:12:48,00:12:51,there was a big red button that said stop.
00:12:51,00:12:52,"- We're in the bathroom, wasn't it?"
00:12:52,00:12:53,- There's in the toilet.
00:12:53,00:12:53,- I couldn't believe it. - I couldn't believe it.
00:12:53,00:12:54,- I couldn't believe it. - I didn't go down.
00:12:54,00:12:55,I could just stop the train.
00:12:55,00:12:57,It was a train stop button in the toilet.
00:12:57,00:12:59,- It's interesting you raised the toilet thing
00:12:59,00:13:01,because there's a blog by someone who works in railways
00:13:01,00:13:02,who says that this is a serious problem
00:13:02,00:13:04,with the emergency button because it is
00:13:04,00:13:05,in the accessible toilets.
00:13:05,00:13:07,And people often pull it thinking it's the flush.
00:13:07,00:13:08,- Yes.
00:13:08,00:13:10,"- If you're an older person, you're a bit confused"
00:13:10,00:13:12,"or a bit drunk, then it often gets pulled to flush the loo"
00:13:12,00:13:14,and then you've breaks the train.
00:13:14,00:13:16,"- Okay, so one in 10 train characters in the UK"
00:13:16,00:13:21,still jettison's toilet waste onto the track
00:13:21,00:13:22,or the flush. - Do they?
00:13:22,00:13:22,- One in 10.
00:13:22,00:13:23,This was in 2015.
00:13:23,00:13:26,"So they are trying to replace them all by 2020,"
00:13:26,00:13:28,but it's still quite a large number.
00:13:28,00:13:29,- Yeah.
00:13:29,00:13:31,- And that's why they're assigned saying don't flush.
00:13:31,00:13:31,- At station.
00:13:31,00:13:33,"- At stations, but it's pretty medieval."
00:13:33,00:13:34,- It's pretty medieval.
00:13:34,00:13:38,"Well, there was a massive report in Wales online recently"
00:13:38,00:13:39,in which they said it's disgusting.
00:13:39,00:13:41,Look at all those excrement on the train tracks
00:13:41,00:13:42,"and they showed a picture of it,"
00:13:42,00:13:45,but then they pixelated everything you could possibly
00:13:45,00:13:45,have dragged to.
00:13:45,00:13:48,So it's just a picture of a train track.
00:13:48,00:13:49,- So what do the others do?
00:13:49,00:13:50,Do they have a sewage system?
00:13:50,00:13:51,- They just story it.
00:13:51,00:13:53,"- Story of a tank. - Story of a tank, yeah."
00:13:53,00:13:54,- Then they fling it out over the countryside
00:13:54,00:13:57,"whether it's... - No, they change it when they're service."
00:13:57,00:13:59,Could they not build underneath the tracks
00:13:59,00:14:02,just speaking of the excrement bits and Nappy?
00:14:02,00:14:05,"- Well, a big train Nappy, yes."
00:14:05,00:14:08,(laughing)
00:14:08,00:14:10,- You just lay the train on its back on a massive mat.
00:14:10,00:14:12,(laughing)
00:14:12,00:14:15,"- Sorry Dan, it's honestly way better than what I was saying."
00:14:15,00:14:16,We'll leave it to that.
00:14:16,00:14:19,- Did you know we used to have sail trains in this country?
00:14:19,00:14:21,"- No, with what's a sail train?"
00:14:21,00:14:23,- Trains with a sail.
00:14:23,00:14:27,And these existed as you'd imagine in kind of windier areas.
00:14:27,00:14:29,So on the coast.
00:14:29,00:14:32,And in Yorkshire there was one.
00:14:32,00:14:35,There was one in 1831 that one opened
00:14:35,00:14:37,which took produce from the Strathmore Valley
00:14:37,00:14:40,which is in Scotland to Dundee.
00:14:40,00:14:41,But obviously it had the problem of
00:14:41,00:14:44,it's quite hard to tack on a trainway.
00:14:44,00:14:45,(laughing)
00:14:45,00:14:47,You can't really control the angle of which you're going.
00:14:47,00:14:50,And so they had to have a horse trotting alongside it
00:14:50,00:14:52,at all times to take over when the wind dropped.
00:14:52,00:14:54,So it's very difficult to get every passenger to duck
00:14:54,00:14:55,when the boom goes in.
00:14:55,00:14:57,(laughing)
00:14:57,00:15:00,"- That in China, remember I had that fact"
00:15:00,00:15:02,in the super early days of the podcast about
00:15:02,00:15:05,they have wheelbarrows in China that we still don't know about.
00:15:05,00:15:08,So they used to do that in China
00:15:08,00:15:11,and there's descriptions of it where this guy would see
00:15:11,00:15:14,a fleet of sails coming when he looked over a mountain top
00:15:14,00:15:16,in a field and what it was is that they used to put
00:15:16,00:15:19,giant sails on their wheelbarrows and let the wind
00:15:19,00:15:21,help them carry along.
00:15:21,00:15:22,- That's so clever.
00:15:22,00:15:23,"- There are loads, yeah, it's amazing, isn't it?"
00:15:23,00:15:25,- Do you not the longest train ever was?
00:15:25,00:15:26,"- The longest train running at the moment,"
00:15:26,00:15:29,it's in someone's native country.
00:15:29,00:15:30,- Who knows where Dan's from?
00:15:30,00:15:31,- It's in Australia.
00:15:31,00:15:34,"- Oh it's in Australia, it's called the gun."
00:15:34,00:15:35,- G-H-A-N.
00:15:35,00:15:36,- Gun?
00:15:36,00:15:36,- Gun.
00:15:36,00:15:40,- So the Sunday service of the gun is 44 characters.
00:15:40,00:15:43,It's 0.7 miles long.
00:15:43,00:15:44,- It's about a 15 minute walk.
00:15:44,00:15:45,- How far does it travel?
00:15:45,00:15:47,Is it like it only moves about two meters
00:15:47,00:15:48,and then it's at the next station
00:15:48,00:15:50,and you have to walk all the way up the train?
00:15:50,00:15:51,"- Yeah, so you even need to go."
00:15:51,00:15:52,"- Yeah, 15 minute walk is like,"
00:15:52,00:15:54,if you're at the wrong end of the buffet
00:15:54,00:15:56,"carriages at the back of the train,"
00:15:56,00:15:57,"- Oh, if you're starving, that way."
00:15:57,00:16:01,"- But, so if you built a car that long,"
00:16:01,00:16:02,that's impressive.
00:16:02,00:16:04,"But a train you're just adding carriages, right?"
00:16:04,00:16:05,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:16:05,00:16:06,- Is that impressive?
00:16:06,00:16:07,- Yeah.
00:16:07,00:16:09,- Effectively that could be much longer
00:16:09,00:16:10,if they just added more.
00:16:10,00:16:11,- There's two days freight trains
00:16:11,00:16:13,"that are like five, six kilometers long."
00:16:13,00:16:14,"- I was just, was this a passenger train?"
00:16:14,00:16:14,- This is a passenger train.
00:16:14,00:16:15,- Yeah.
00:16:15,00:16:18,- But you need platforms long enough.
00:16:18,00:16:20,"- That's the really, those are the unsung heroes"
00:16:20,00:16:23,of the operation people could pour in concrete
00:16:23,00:16:25,for a year as a desert.
00:16:25,00:16:26,- So where does it go to?
00:16:26,00:16:27,- It goes across Australia.
00:16:27,00:16:28,"- Right, so it's a proper..."
00:16:28,00:16:29,"- Yeah, I think it goes all the way"
00:16:29,00:16:30,from the north coast to the south.
00:16:30,00:16:31,- Wow.
00:16:31,00:16:32,- It's a huge long route.
00:16:32,00:16:33,"- Yeah, that's amazing."
00:16:33,00:16:33,- So you'd need that.
00:16:33,00:16:36,You'd need that for a variety of fun.
00:16:36,00:16:36,- A variety of fun.
00:16:36,00:16:38,- There's probably playrooms in there.
00:16:38,00:16:39,There's probably a barbers.
00:16:39,00:16:40,There's probably a cinema.
00:16:40,00:16:41,There's probably...
00:16:41,00:16:43,"- There's none of these things, the facts."
00:16:43,00:16:45,(laughing)
00:16:46,00:16:50,- I can't just make up what your fantasy big train would be.
00:16:50,00:16:51,- A real conjecture.
00:16:51,00:16:53,"I'm never seen you look so angry, I don't know."
00:16:53,00:16:55,- Someone's going to remember that.
00:16:55,00:16:57,And remember it is genuine knowledge.
00:16:57,00:16:58,- I said probably.
00:16:58,00:16:59,"- I know, but..."
00:16:59,00:17:02,"- Yeah, I mean, that's, that in itself is problematic,"
00:17:02,00:17:03,saying probably.
00:17:03,00:17:04,- Really?
00:17:04,00:17:05,- Of the balancer.
00:17:05,00:17:05,- Yeah.
00:17:05,00:17:07,- And the probability says there will be one of them.
00:17:07,00:17:09,- But it probably is.
00:17:09,00:17:10,(laughing)
00:17:10,00:17:11,- There possibly is.
00:17:11,00:17:12,- There probably isn't.
00:17:12,00:17:14,- I think there probably is.
00:17:14,00:17:16,- You can't say there probably isn't.
00:17:16,00:17:18,- There's a microscopically small chance
00:17:18,00:17:20,that there are all of those things you just listed
00:17:20,00:17:22,"as far as we can go with this fact, I think."
00:17:22,00:17:25,"- Okay, this is really cool."
00:17:25,00:17:27,"In Japan, they're now building new trains"
00:17:27,00:17:29,that are invisible.
00:17:29,00:17:30,"- No, they're not."
00:17:30,00:17:31,"- No, they're not, come on."
00:17:31,00:17:32,(laughing)
00:17:32,00:17:34,- What they are is kind of invisible.
00:17:34,00:17:36,They're sort of almost invisible.
00:17:36,00:17:39,They've put this mirrored surface on the outside of it.
00:17:39,00:17:41,So it blends into its surroundings by reflecting.
00:17:41,00:17:44,"So if you're going through nature, for example,"
00:17:44,00:17:46,"and you're surrounded by trees, blue sky, green grass,"
00:17:46,00:17:49,"all that sort of stuff, if that's on the other side of it,"
00:17:49,00:17:51,that kind of mirrors off the side of the train.
00:17:51,00:17:53,"Therefore, oh, so you're not just going to see"
00:17:53,00:17:55,hundreds of passengers like sitting in there.
00:17:55,00:17:56,"- That's not that, yeah."
00:17:56,00:17:57,- That's good.
00:17:57,00:17:59,So if you're going on a nice countryside walk
00:17:59,00:18:01,"and your footpath crosses over a railway,"
00:18:01,00:18:03,then now you won't be able to see the train come towards you.
00:18:03,00:18:04,"- Yes, exactly."
00:18:04,00:18:05,- The chance I do.
00:18:05,00:18:06,- You would just see yourself coming towards you
00:18:06,00:18:07,at high speed.
00:18:07,00:18:08,"- Oh, that was nice."
00:18:08,00:18:09,"- You're like, what?"
00:18:09,00:18:11,And that guy is running fast.
00:18:11,00:18:11,(laughing)
00:18:11,00:18:14,(upbeat music)
00:18:14,00:18:19,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:18:19,00:18:21,and that is Chuzinski.
00:18:21,00:18:23,- My fact this week is that birds and cages
00:18:23,00:18:26,hop in the direction they're meant to be migrating.
00:18:26,00:18:27,- Wow.
00:18:27,00:18:29,- That sounds very sad.
00:18:29,00:18:32,- Do they do that only during migrating periods?
00:18:32,00:18:34,"- Yes, this is the amazing thing about it."
00:18:34,00:18:37,"If you've got a cage bird that's a migrating bird,"
00:18:37,00:18:39,"then as soon as the time comes,"
00:18:39,00:18:40,"when it would usually be migrating, first of all,"
00:18:40,00:18:43,it puts on all this body fat 'cause that's what birds do.
00:18:43,00:18:45,So a lot of birds will double their body weight
00:18:45,00:18:47,in preparation for big migrations.
00:18:47,00:18:49,"So it'll put on all this weight,"
00:18:49,00:18:50,"and it'll get really, really restless"
00:18:50,00:18:52,and frisky and start flapping around the cage.
00:18:52,00:18:54,"And then when the migration period starts,"
00:18:54,00:18:57,it will then start moving towards the end of the cage
00:18:57,00:18:59,that is in the direction of where it would be migrating.
00:18:59,00:19:02,And it will stop at exactly the time
00:19:02,00:19:03,that it would have arrived at its destination.
00:19:03,00:19:04,- Wow.
00:19:04,00:19:05,- So perfectly timed.
00:19:05,00:19:07,- But it's now fat.
00:19:07,00:19:08,- Exactly.
00:19:08,00:19:10,- It'll double its weight and it can't burn the weight off.
00:19:10,00:19:11,And there's not where it wants to be.
00:19:11,00:19:12,- Yeah.
00:19:12,00:19:15,"- Just in terms of observation of that,"
00:19:15,00:19:17,"you obviously see the bird hopping that way,"
00:19:17,00:19:19,but it will reach the end of the cage.
00:19:19,00:19:20,"- Yeah, it's a good point, isn't it?"
00:19:20,00:19:22,- So it doesn't just hang by the end of the cage
00:19:22,00:19:23,"the whole time, right?"
00:19:23,00:19:25,"Therefore, some people must observe the bird"
00:19:25,00:19:26,hopping the other way.
00:19:26,00:19:30,"- Yeah, so I think it will kind of maybe wander backwards a bit."
00:19:30,00:19:31,This is actually not explained
00:19:31,00:19:32,"in a lot of the sources that reference it,"
00:19:32,00:19:35,"but what it does do is it faces in that direction,"
00:19:35,00:19:37,it will try to flap towards that direction
00:19:37,00:19:39,"and then get rebounded off the cage, I guess."
00:19:39,00:19:41,"And also what they do is they'll sit on their perch,"
00:19:41,00:19:43,"facing the direction they're supposed to be going,"
00:19:43,00:19:45,"and they'll flap their wings a lot,"
00:19:45,00:19:46,but stay motionless 'cause they realize
00:19:46,00:19:49,they can't get out of the cage during migration.
00:19:49,00:19:49,- That's extraordinary.
00:19:49,00:19:50,- So they'll flush her about.
00:19:50,00:19:52,- Do you know how they found out about this?
00:19:52,00:19:53,Or one of the ways they found out about this
00:19:53,00:19:56,is with a device called an emlin funnel.
00:19:56,00:19:57,- Yeah.
00:19:57,00:19:58,- This is a very cool thing.
00:19:58,00:19:59,So it's a plastic enclosure
00:19:59,00:20:02,with a paper funnel leading out from the top of that.
00:20:02,00:20:06,On the base of the funnel is ink pad.
00:20:06,00:20:07,"So you put the bird in there,"
00:20:07,00:20:09,you cover the top of the funnel.
00:20:09,00:20:11,So it can't just fly out.
00:20:11,00:20:13,And then you track the direction it moves in.
00:20:13,00:20:18,"And as it flaps, it leaves foot marks in the ink on the paper."
00:20:18,00:20:19,So you can tell exactly the direction
00:20:19,00:20:21,it's moving and flapping in.
00:20:21,00:20:22,"And they have at the surface,"
00:20:22,00:20:26,you can project different star constellations on the top
00:20:26,00:20:27,"to see if that has an effect,"
00:20:27,00:20:29,"'cause sometimes they go magnetically,"
00:20:29,00:20:30,but sometimes they might do it
00:20:30,00:20:32,by looking at the stars above them.
00:20:32,00:20:32,- That's horrible.
00:20:32,00:20:34,That's like a dethruman show for birds.
00:20:34,00:20:35,"- It is, yeah."
00:20:35,00:20:37,- Eventually they end up just writing messages
00:20:37,00:20:39,"in the ink saying, ""Please God, somebody let me out."""
00:20:39,00:20:40,(laughing)
00:20:40,00:20:41,"Once they discovered this,"
00:20:41,00:20:44,then people realize you could do these brilliant experiments
00:20:44,00:20:46,to work out what it was that causes birds to migrate
00:20:46,00:20:47,in certain directions.
00:20:47,00:20:50,"So as you say, Andy, you could change the constellations"
00:20:50,00:20:51,to see if they navigated by that.
00:20:51,00:20:54,You change the magnetic field around a bird's cage.
00:20:54,00:20:57,So obviously they navigate by the magnetism of the earth.
00:20:57,00:20:59,"And so if you put a couple of magnets,"
00:20:59,00:21:01,you create a magnetic field around a bird cage
00:21:01,00:21:03,"and change the direction they think is north,"
00:21:03,00:21:05,they'll suddenly point in a different direction.
00:21:05,00:21:07,- I heard on the radio the other day
00:21:07,00:21:11,"that whales that suddenly get lost in the ocean,"
00:21:11,00:21:13,they think it's actually down to solar flares
00:21:13,00:21:15,because the solar flare is mess with the magnetism
00:21:15,00:21:17,of the earth if you get hit by massive ones.
00:21:17,00:21:19,So suddenly the whales would just be put
00:21:19,00:21:21,on a different course and that's why groups of them
00:21:21,00:21:23,"have been, that's not a solid theory"
00:21:23,00:21:25,but because they just are trying to work out
00:21:25,00:21:28,why seemingly healthy groups of whales get lost.
00:21:28,00:21:29,- That's amazing.
00:21:29,00:21:32,- Just one more thing related to this.
00:21:32,00:21:35,So there was this amazing experiment done recently
00:21:35,00:21:38,into reed warblers that were picked up in Russia
00:21:38,00:21:41,and was to work out exactly how much birds can tell
00:21:41,00:21:43,if you change the magnetic field.
00:21:43,00:21:45,So scientists went and they found some reed warblers in Russia
00:21:45,00:21:49,and they created a magnetic field around their enclosure
00:21:49,00:21:51,that mimicked conditions in Aberdeen.
00:21:51,00:21:54,And the weird thing about this is that.
00:21:54,00:21:57,- That's a distinctive magnetic flavor of Aberdeen.
00:21:57,00:22:00,Most of oil refineries that have been held
00:22:00,00:22:01,in hard times recently.
00:22:01,00:22:03,"- Yeah, exactly, some weather spoons."
00:22:03,00:22:07,So they did this but the weird thing was that Aberdeen
00:22:07,00:22:09,is on roughly the same line of latitude.
00:22:09,00:22:11,So the same distance from the equator
00:22:11,00:22:14,as the place in Russia where they'd studied the birds.
00:22:14,00:22:16,"And so you would have thought that for them,"
00:22:16,00:22:18,if they're just testing the magnetic distance
00:22:18,00:22:21,"from the poles, they would think it was the same place"
00:22:21,00:22:23,but it turns out they can tell how far east or west
00:22:23,00:22:24,they are as well.
00:22:24,00:22:28,So what happened was all they did was change the magnetic field
00:22:28,00:22:30,and the birds would usually point west
00:22:30,00:22:33,"'cause they were my great Europe, so south-west."
00:22:33,00:22:34,"And as soon as you change the field,"
00:22:34,00:22:37,the birds swiveled around and they pointed east
00:22:37,00:22:38,knowing that they're in Aberdeen
00:22:38,00:22:41,and they need to point in exactly a different direction
00:22:41,00:22:43,in order to get where they're going to migrate to.
00:22:43,00:22:45,- But they're very clever.
00:22:45,00:22:46,- That's very cool.
00:22:46,00:22:49,It's so weird that we're missing this thing
00:22:49,00:22:50,that all these animals have.
00:22:50,00:22:51,- It's so annoying.
00:22:51,00:22:54,"- You've got nothing that even remotely makes us go,"
00:22:54,00:22:56,"oh, I can relate to that, which is nothing."
00:22:56,00:22:59,There's no sense of magnetism's crazy.
00:22:59,00:23:02,The thing you said about how birds put on loads of weight
00:23:02,00:23:05,before they migrate so that they've got enough energy
00:23:05,00:23:07,"to get them through, it's amazing."
00:23:07,00:23:12,Even their organs grow and shrink in this period.
00:23:12,00:23:14,"So all the organs involved with feeding,"
00:23:14,00:23:17,"like the stomach and the liver and the kidneys and so on,"
00:23:17,00:23:20,they get bigger to support the fueling process.
00:23:20,00:23:23,"But then during the take-off and migration,"
00:23:23,00:23:26,"those organ shrink and then the heart and the flight muscles,"
00:23:26,00:23:28,they all grow.
00:23:28,00:23:30,- So it's a complete reconfiguration.
00:23:30,00:23:32,They're changing the way the plane is built as they fly.
00:23:32,00:23:34,- So cool.
00:23:34,00:23:35,- That is amazing.
00:23:35,00:23:37,That is awesome.
00:23:37,00:23:39,- I should actually say the loads of what I'm saying
00:23:39,00:23:41,"comes from an episode of In Our Time,"
00:23:41,00:23:44,"including the headline fact, which is on bird migration,"
00:23:44,00:23:44,which is brilliant.
00:23:44,00:23:46,"You should look it up, In Our Time is always good."
00:23:46,00:23:47,- Yeah.
00:23:47,00:23:50,"- Yeah, when Planet Earth was coming out,"
00:23:50,00:23:51,"the David Adamborough documentary,"
00:23:51,00:23:54,"I was sat watching Alistair Fothergill,"
00:23:54,00:23:59,who is the program maker behind Blue Planet and Planet Earth.
00:23:59,00:24:02,I went to a chat that he did of sort of talk at the BBC.
00:24:02,00:24:05,"And he was talking about his favorite moment,"
00:24:05,00:24:08,being the moment that the birds had to migrate over Everest.
00:24:08,00:24:11,"In order to migrate, they had to go over Mount Everest."
00:24:11,00:24:14,And it took every ounce of their energy.
00:24:14,00:24:16,- You get geese flying over Mount Everest.
00:24:16,00:24:17,- Dee!
00:24:17,00:24:19,"- You've taken all your energy,"
00:24:19,00:24:22,just see a flock of geese flying over you.
00:24:22,00:24:25,Are they using thermals or are they flying?
00:24:25,00:24:26,They are flying.
00:24:26,00:24:27,They never stop flapping their wings.
00:24:27,00:24:29,They never glide.
00:24:29,00:24:30,- They never glide?
00:24:30,00:24:31,- They never glide.
00:24:31,00:24:32,- It's so rough for us like that.
00:24:32,00:24:34,"- There's only, I think, what is it?"
00:24:34,00:24:37,A tenth of the oxygen you find at sea level.
00:24:37,00:24:39,"Obviously, when you're up that high,"
00:24:39,00:24:40,and they're still managing to fly all the time.
00:24:40,00:24:42,- So they are panting presumably at that point?
00:24:42,00:24:45,- We worked out that geese couldn't glide.
00:24:45,00:24:50,Have we tried to make any ounce of stuff to dead goose
00:24:50,00:24:52,and kind of do a glider?
00:24:52,00:24:55,"- What I mean is, like, do scientists"
00:24:55,00:24:58,knowing the makeup of a geese know they could do it?
00:24:58,00:24:59,They just haven't worked out to do it.
00:24:59,00:25:01,- They just don't have the confidence.
00:25:01,00:25:03,(laughing)
00:25:03,00:25:04,"'Cause presumably, if they're up there"
00:25:04,00:25:07,"and their wings are, you know, they've got wings,"
00:25:07,00:25:10,"surely just spreading them out, must buy them some glider."
00:25:10,00:25:11,"- I think they're quite, I think creatures, they're quite,"
00:25:11,00:25:12,I don't know.
00:25:12,00:25:13,I really don't know.
00:25:13,00:25:15,"- They wouldn't be able to, 'cause of evolution."
00:25:15,00:25:17,"- So the ones that try to fly, a long time ago."
00:25:17,00:25:19,- The evolution of creation.
00:25:19,00:25:20,- The evolution of creation.
00:25:20,00:25:21,- The evolution of creation.
00:25:21,00:25:23,- That's your answer every week.
00:25:23,00:25:25,"- There was ones that go just like you, Dad."
00:25:25,00:25:26,"- She's always right, don't care."
00:25:26,00:25:27,(laughing)
00:25:27,00:25:29,"- When is God gonna be the answer, ever?"
00:25:29,00:25:30,(laughing)
00:25:30,00:25:33,(upbeat music)
00:25:33,00:25:38,"- Okay, there's time for our final fact of the show,"
00:25:38,00:25:40,and that is my fact.
00:25:40,00:25:43,"My fact is that each year,"
00:25:43,00:25:46,26 tons of clothing is left behind
00:25:46,00:25:49,at the starting line of the Boston marathon.
00:25:49,00:25:53,That is one ton for every mile of the marathon.
00:25:53,00:25:54,- But why?
00:25:54,00:25:56,"I mean, why people, as people just taking off all their clothes"
00:25:56,00:25:58,when they get to the start of the marathon?
00:25:58,00:26:00,- This is exactly what's happening.
00:26:00,00:26:02,"It's early in the morning, it's gonna be cold."
00:26:02,00:26:06,"So they bring long trackies, a zip up jacket or whatever,"
00:26:06,00:26:08,"and then when the marathon starts,"
00:26:08,00:26:09,they take off the outer clothing
00:26:09,00:26:12,so that they're in the classic marathon runner clothing.
00:26:12,00:26:13,- And they just drop it where it is.
00:26:13,00:26:14,- They just drop it where it is.
00:26:14,00:26:15,- That's gonna be difficult if you're right
00:26:15,00:26:16,at the back of the marathon.
00:26:16,00:26:18,"You've got a huge, like a horse jump to go."
00:26:18,00:26:20,(laughing)
00:26:20,00:26:21,"- Yeah, a really good point."
00:26:21,00:26:23,"- Yeah, I think they chuck it to the side."
00:26:23,00:26:24,- Okay.
00:26:24,00:26:25,- This is an article that was written
00:26:25,00:26:28,"about a person in America called Judy Patasi,"
00:26:28,00:26:31,and Judy Patasi used to help marathon runners
00:26:31,00:26:33,if they needed somewhere.
00:26:33,00:26:34,Some coffee and some tea and stuff.
00:26:34,00:26:38,"It was just generally a helpful person, love the marathon."
00:26:38,00:26:40,"And for years, runners would be doing this,"
00:26:40,00:26:41,"just taking off those bits of clothing,"
00:26:41,00:26:42,"leaving them on the ground,"
00:26:42,00:26:45,and occasionally charities would come and collect some of them
00:26:45,00:26:46,and bring them to charities.
00:26:46,00:26:48,"And in one year, no charities came."
00:26:48,00:26:51,And they bagged up all the stuff and they threw it in the trash
00:26:51,00:26:52,and that really infuriated her
00:26:52,00:26:53,'cause she said this is such a waste.
00:26:53,00:26:55,So she's made it her mission
00:26:55,00:26:57,to now collect all of these clothes.
00:26:57,00:27:00,"And to begin with, it wasn't as much as 26 tons."
00:27:00,00:27:01,It was even less.
00:27:01,00:27:02,It changes all the time.
00:27:02,00:27:05,"The latest article, the article I'm specifically getting it from,"
00:27:05,00:27:07,it was 26 that they managed to collect.
00:27:07,00:27:10,Obviously it varies year by year.
00:27:10,00:27:14,The exact quote from her is now I have 201 volunteers.
00:27:14,00:27:16,We cover all the way to Ashland Townline
00:27:16,00:27:19,"and we've gotten up to 52,000 pounds,"
00:27:19,00:27:22,which is the equivalent of 26 tons.
00:27:22,00:27:23,That is amazing.
00:27:23,00:27:25,And the reason it's gone up dramatically
00:27:25,00:27:27,is because there used to be a bus service
00:27:27,00:27:29,right at the end of the Boston marathon
00:27:29,00:27:30,that would bring you back to the start
00:27:30,00:27:32,so people could collect their clothes
00:27:32,00:27:34,but they canceled the bus service.
00:27:34,00:27:36,"So now all of these clothes, people just go,"
00:27:36,00:27:38,"what do you know, we'll just leave it there."
00:27:38,00:27:39,So they now collect these all
00:27:39,00:27:41,and they give them to charities and raise so much money.
00:27:41,00:27:42,But yeah.
00:27:42,00:27:43,There must be an awareness thing as well though.
00:27:43,00:27:45,"If you run, you know what's going to happen to the clothes"
00:27:45,00:27:47,"so you think, well, I'm just going to bring loads of clothes"
00:27:47,00:27:48,and stuff.
00:27:48,00:27:49,"I would hope so, because--"
00:27:49,00:27:51,"Hey, I can't believe running a marathon is hard enough"
00:27:51,00:27:52,without having to admit to yourself
00:27:52,00:27:55,that you have to lose an entire outfit in the process.
00:27:55,00:27:57,"And also, I'm the kind of unlikable person"
00:27:57,00:28:00,"who would definitely throw my clothes aside,"
00:28:00,00:28:01,bear in mind where I'd thrown them
00:28:01,00:28:03,and then walk back a bit later to pick them up.
00:28:03,00:28:06,And I'd be pretty irritated if they'd been sent to South
00:28:06,00:28:08,who'd down by that point.
00:28:08,00:28:10,So there's a thing about the Boston Marathon
00:28:10,00:28:11,which is that it's for--
00:28:11,00:28:13,it's for very good runners as in.
00:28:13,00:28:14,"Obviously, all marathons are for very good runners."
00:28:14,00:28:18,But only the fastest amateurs get in and qualify
00:28:18,00:28:19,for the Boston Marathon.
00:28:19,00:28:22,"So there is a guy, his name is Derek Murphy."
00:28:22,00:28:23,He's an American man.
00:28:23,00:28:26,And he is a marathon enthusiast.
00:28:26,00:28:30,And he's made it his life's work to spot people cheating
00:28:30,00:28:32,in marathons from hundreds of miles away.
00:28:32,00:28:34,Hundreds of miles away.
00:28:34,00:28:36,"Yeah, he's got this incredible telescope."
00:28:36,00:28:41,But it's only 26 miles.
00:28:41,00:28:43,Who's some really elaborate cheating going on?
00:28:43,00:28:46,"When you run the other way around the world, yes."
00:28:46,00:28:48,So the BBC did a profile of him.
00:28:48,00:28:50,He has this blog called Marathon Investigation.
00:28:50,00:28:52,And he started wondering whether people
00:28:52,00:28:54,cheat to get to qualify for the Boston Marathon.
00:28:54,00:28:57,"They'll run another marathon, which you have to do."
00:28:57,00:28:59,And he looks at suspiciously fast times.
00:28:59,00:29:02,And he looks at photos taken during the race
00:29:02,00:29:03,to see if he can track people down.
00:29:03,00:29:06,"So he's caught people who've used other people's bib numbers,"
00:29:06,00:29:09,or he's caught people who've perhaps missed out stages
00:29:09,00:29:10,throughout.
00:29:10,00:29:12,"But he has also vindicated at least one person,"
00:29:12,00:29:15,where the authorities thought that runner was cheating.
00:29:15,00:29:16,"And he managed to find the evidence to say,"
00:29:16,00:29:19,"no, I don't think his person was cheating, isn't it?"
00:29:19,00:29:20,Why is he--
00:29:20,00:29:23,"I mean, I really support vigilante justice"
00:29:23,00:29:26,"in certain cases, I suppose."
00:29:26,00:29:29,But is this a major problem in morality and crime?
00:29:29,00:29:33,"If you support Batman, you should support this guy."
00:29:33,00:29:34,That's what I'm saying.
00:29:34,00:29:35,This is like--
00:29:35,00:29:37,"And actually, the downgrade the Batman"
00:29:37,00:29:40,would have to take to be doing that.
00:29:40,00:29:43,"So in 1980, there was a woman called Rosie Ruiz,"
00:29:43,00:29:46,who was declared the winner of the marathon.
00:29:46,00:29:48,But then it was later found out that she
00:29:48,00:29:50,"had taken the subway for part of the way, frowned on."
00:29:50,00:29:52,"Yeah, this is frowned on."
00:29:52,00:29:54,"Can't if no one noticed her ducking out of the marathon,"
00:29:54,00:29:56,"popping into a subway station, and then--"
00:29:56,00:29:58,But you probably think someone was ducking out
00:29:58,00:30:00,just to get themselves the drink or--
00:30:00,00:30:02,"Or ducking out altogether, being like, actually,"
00:30:02,00:30:03,this is not for me.
00:30:03,00:30:05,"And it can't be lined all the way, can it?"
00:30:05,00:30:07,"It's in 1980 as well, maybe it was just less organized."
00:30:07,00:30:10,But I think the suspicious bit is when you come out of the subway
00:30:10,00:30:10,and join the race.
00:30:10,00:30:11,That's the crucial--
00:30:11,00:30:13,"That's true, yeah."
00:30:13,00:30:16,"I read about it, lady, because you can go off trail."
00:30:16,00:30:20,A Florida woman who became lost during a half marathon
00:30:20,00:30:22,when she just took the wrong corner.
00:30:22,00:30:24,So she was found nearly 12 hours later
00:30:24,00:30:28,"in the middle of a 25,000 acre park just completely lost."
00:30:28,00:30:29,"Oh, no."
00:30:29,00:30:33,At what point do you think you stop running?
00:30:33,00:30:34,At what point is it obvious to you
00:30:34,00:30:37,that you're now no longer running the marathon?
00:30:37,00:30:39,"Yes, yeah."
00:30:39,00:30:42,Do you think she just thought she was way ahead?
00:30:42,00:30:45,I didn't know that you have to wear it
00:30:45,00:30:47,that one of those bibs when you run a marathon.
00:30:47,00:30:47,Yeah.
00:30:47,00:30:49,"They have trackers in them, and they"
00:30:49,00:30:52,"have mats across the marathon course,"
00:30:52,00:30:56,which electronically log you making particular checkpoints
00:30:56,00:30:57,along the way.
00:30:57,00:30:58,"That is not made, you sure?"
00:30:58,00:31:00,"Anyone who's ever run a marathon knows that,"
00:31:00,00:31:01,but I had no idea.
00:31:01,00:31:03,That's like in a computer game when you get hit checkpoints.
00:31:03,00:31:04,"Exactly, yeah."
00:31:04,00:31:07,And so sometimes that's the way of identifying cheaters
00:31:07,00:31:09,if the bib missed out several checkpoints.
00:31:09,00:31:11,"Yeah, yeah."
00:31:11,00:31:14,"So another cheater was a woman called Catherine Swiser,"
00:31:14,00:31:16,who-- so maybe your guy with a telescope
00:31:16,00:31:18,might want to get onto her.
00:31:18,00:31:22,"She was a woman, and she tried to run the marathon in 1967."
00:31:22,00:31:24,"And she registered with just her initials,"
00:31:24,00:31:26,"so it was gender neutral, so it wasn't"
00:31:26,00:31:27,known that she was a woman.
00:31:27,00:31:30,And she ran the marathon.
00:31:30,00:31:31,"And people were quite supportive in the crowds,"
00:31:31,00:31:34,"but then Jock Semple, who was a race official,"
00:31:34,00:31:35,was really against the idea of women running.
00:31:35,00:31:37,People thought women were way too fragile.
00:31:37,00:31:40,It kind of muddied the masculinity of the sport for men.
00:31:40,00:31:44,"And so he stormed onto the track and tried to drag her off it,"
00:31:44,00:31:47,at which point her boyfriend came and kind of defended
00:31:47,00:31:48,"her, which is a little bit annoying"
00:31:48,00:31:50,"from the feminist perspective, but her boyfriend"
00:31:50,00:31:52,came on and pushed Jock Semple out the way.
00:31:52,00:31:53,And she finished.
00:31:53,00:31:56,And the nice thing about her is that this year
00:31:56,00:31:58,"was the 50th anniversary of when she did that,"
00:31:58,00:31:59,and she ran it again.
00:31:59,00:32:00,Great.
00:32:00,00:32:01,How was she?
00:32:01,00:32:02,"She wasn't a cheater, though."
00:32:02,00:32:03,Was she?
00:32:03,00:32:05,"Yeah, she cheated by pretending to be a man."
00:32:05,00:32:05,OK.
00:32:05,00:32:07,"Technically speaking, she wasn't allowed to enter."
00:32:07,00:32:08,"Yes, right."
00:32:08,00:32:08,Yeah.
00:32:08,00:32:09,I guess so.
00:32:09,00:32:12,"She's the bad guy in this story, anyway."
00:32:12,00:32:15,"The furthest away, I guess, that the marathon"
00:32:15,00:32:16,"has ever been run off the course,"
00:32:16,00:32:19,"since we were talking about that, is Sunita Williams,"
00:32:19,00:32:20,"who's a NASA astronaut, and she ran it"
00:32:20,00:32:22,"while she was on the International Space Station,"
00:32:22,00:32:23,on the treadmill.
00:32:23,00:32:25,So someone argue she was going way faster than anyone
00:32:25,00:32:28,"asking, she was coaching me, yeah, for the very time."
00:32:28,00:32:29,"There's a thing about the Berlin marathon,"
00:32:29,00:32:33,which is that loads of records get broken on that marathon course
00:32:33,00:32:35,"and not, for example, on the London one,"
00:32:35,00:32:37,"or the Kuala Lumpur one, or the Boston one."
00:32:37,00:32:38,And there are all these reasons which
00:32:38,00:32:41,combine to make Berlin one of the best places
00:32:41,00:32:42,to break a speed record.
00:32:42,00:32:44,So it's really flat.
00:32:44,00:32:46,There are very few corners.
00:32:46,00:32:48,It's never more than 53 meters above sea level.
00:32:48,00:32:50,So lots of lovely oxygen.
00:32:50,00:32:52,"And it's in September, which is quite a good time of year,"
00:32:52,00:32:53,because the weather's not crazy.
00:32:53,00:32:54,And it's mostly on asphalt.
00:32:54,00:32:57,And so there are all of these different combination
00:32:57,00:33:00,factors that conspire to make it a great best record.
00:33:00,00:33:02,"Whereas Boston, the Boston marathon course,"
00:33:02,00:33:05,the finish line is so much lower than the starting line
00:33:05,00:33:08,that it is ineligible for world record attempts.
00:33:08,00:33:09,- No way. - Yeah.
00:33:09,00:33:10,"Because you're running downhill, basically,"
00:33:10,00:33:12,you're running downhill.
00:33:12,00:33:14,- Wow. - No way.
00:33:14,00:33:15,- Why don't they just move it then?
00:33:15,00:33:16,I don't know.
00:33:16,00:33:17,I'll put it the other way around.
00:33:17,00:33:20,- Put it the other way around.
00:33:20,00:33:21,- Record breaking in the Boston marathon
00:33:21,00:33:22,is a quite interesting thing.
00:33:22,00:33:24,"So in 2010, a guy broke the world"
00:33:24,00:33:25,record for Boston Marta.
00:33:25,00:33:28,His name was Robert K. Chirio from Kenya.
00:33:28,00:33:31,But he broke the record that was set previously
00:33:31,00:33:34,by a man also named Robert K. Chirio
00:33:34,00:33:35,"by complete coincidence, no relation."
00:33:35,00:33:36,- No relation. - No relation.
00:33:36,00:33:37,"- So weird, right?"
00:33:37,00:33:41,"He must have changed his name to, no, no."
00:33:41,00:33:43,"I mean, I suppose you may be to more common,"
00:33:43,00:33:46,"maybe it's a bit like a John Smith for your name or something,"
00:33:46,00:33:48,but that's amazing.
00:33:48,00:33:51,- So the first African person to win the Boston marathon
00:33:51,00:33:53,won it in 1988.
00:33:53,00:33:55,I guess probably because logistics got easier
00:33:55,00:33:58,"for people to enter at that point, maybe from abroad."
00:33:58,00:34:00,So 1988 was the first African person to win it.
00:34:00,00:34:02,It was Ibrahim Hussein from Kenya.
00:34:02,00:34:05,"Since then, there have only been three winners"
00:34:05,00:34:07,who haven't been Kenya or Ethiopia.
00:34:07,00:34:09,(laughing)
00:34:09,00:34:10,He'll just win.
00:34:10,00:34:13,"Oh, we're actually much better at this than these guys."
00:34:13,00:34:14,(laughing)
00:34:14,00:34:17,(upbeat music)
00:34:17,00:34:21,"- Okay, that is it."
00:34:21,00:34:22,That is all of our facts.
00:34:22,00:34:23,Thank you so much for listening.
