00:00:00,00:00:01,We run it on QI a few years ago.
00:00:01,00:00:02,Yeah.
00:00:02,00:00:04,"And which was, there's no such thing as a fish."
00:00:04,00:00:05,It's kind of the nicer thing as a fish.
00:00:05,00:00:10,"No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life."
00:00:10,00:00:12,"It says it right there, first paragraph, no such thing as a fish."
00:00:12,00:00:26,"Hello, and welcome to another edition of ""No Such Thing As A Fish"""
00:00:26,00:00:28,a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices
00:00:28,00:00:30,in Culverant Garden.
00:00:30,00:00:31,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:31,00:00:33,"I'm sitting here with three other QI elves, James,"
00:00:33,00:00:36,"Markin, Hanuch, Zinsky, and Andy Murray."
00:00:36,00:00:38,"And once again, we've gathered around the microphones"
00:00:38,00:00:41,to share our favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:41,00:00:43,"So, in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:43,00:00:48,"James, let's begin with you."
00:00:48,00:00:53,"OK, yeah, my fat this week is it was fashionable in New York"
00:00:53,00:00:55,at the end of the 19th century for ladies
00:00:55,00:00:57,to wear live lizards as broaches.
00:00:57,00:00:58,Wow.
00:00:58,00:01:00,With a pin on them?
00:01:00,00:01:02,"Well, actually, with a small leash, it seems."
00:01:02,00:01:05,This was an article in the archive of The New York Times
00:01:05,00:01:09,about the RSPCA complaining about it.
00:01:09,00:01:09,I'm surprising.
00:01:09,00:01:12,"Yeah, I mean, let me give you a few little bits."
00:01:12,00:01:14,The lizards have been sold as chameleons.
00:01:14,00:01:19,"They were fastened to cushions by means of tiny colors and chains,"
00:01:19,00:01:22,and they have become quite a plaything with many people.
00:01:22,00:01:24,Sometimes they were worn in the streets by women
00:01:24,00:01:26,who had them attached to their bodices.
00:01:26,00:01:28,It doesn't really give any more information than that.
00:01:28,00:01:29,And was this popular?
00:01:29,00:01:30,"Was it, did a lot of people do it?"
00:01:30,00:01:34,I imagine it didn't last for very long because the RSPCA
00:01:34,00:01:35,in the New York Times got involved.
00:01:35,00:01:38,Are there any other animals that we've known to have worn?
00:01:38,00:01:41,"Yes, which really recently, maybe used all this as well."
00:01:41,00:01:43,And I don't really know why I don't remember this.
00:01:43,00:01:45,"Apparently, in 2006, there was a fashion designer"
00:01:45,00:01:48,who designed cockroach broaches.
00:01:48,00:01:49,I think mainly because of the rhyming thing.
00:01:49,00:01:51,But they became quite a popular thing.
00:01:51,00:01:53,And there was a live cockroach on a brooch.
00:01:53,00:01:56,"And so they were decorated with like,"
00:01:56,00:01:57,ornate jewelry and painted gold and stuff.
00:01:57,00:02:00,And apparently they could last up to a year.
00:02:00,00:02:01,And they just crawled around using it.
00:02:01,00:02:02,I think Paris Hilton got one.
00:02:02,00:02:05,Women used to keep the small pets in their moths.
00:02:05,00:02:07,They would decorate their moths with jewels
00:02:07,00:02:09,and they would put pets in there.
00:02:09,00:02:12,"And for a while, it was like a status symbol."
00:02:12,00:02:14,"The larger your moth was, the more rich you were."
00:02:14,00:02:17,"So if you get a horse in there, a 16-hander,"
00:02:17,00:02:19,then that's impressive.
00:02:19,00:02:22,"People are going, she must be a princess or something."
00:02:22,00:02:24,She has a moth that fits a horse in.
00:02:24,00:02:26,"People would be impressed, yes?"
00:02:26,00:02:30,"There was another live animal that people used, apparently,"
00:02:30,00:02:31,in the Middle Ages.
00:02:31,00:02:33,One recommended cure for the plague
00:02:33,00:02:38,was strapping a live chicken around the bubos on your body.
00:02:38,00:02:39,"Oh, yeah."
00:02:39,00:02:40,That work?
00:02:40,00:02:41,"No, no, that's why a third of Europe died."
00:02:41,00:02:46,I find that amazing.
00:02:46,00:02:49,"They used to think that if you got bitten by a snake,"
00:02:49,00:02:53,"that if you put a live pigeon on the bite,"
00:02:53,00:02:56,"the bottom of a pigeon, it would suck out the venom."
00:02:56,00:02:57,That's right.
00:02:57,00:02:59,"Yeah, and you would consistently use more and more pigeons"
00:02:59,00:03:03,until the final anus sucking pigeon didn't die.
00:03:03,00:03:04,And then you knew you got all the poison out.
00:03:04,00:03:07,"I have a very dim memory of people in China, a thousand,"
00:03:07,00:03:11,"or so years ago, keeping something, a little insect"
00:03:11,00:03:15,"in a cage around their necks, which had drunk their lovers blood."
00:03:15,00:03:17,"Yeah, that would happen in Europe with fleas."
00:03:17,00:03:18,"Fleas, that's it."
00:03:18,00:03:21,But I can't imagine a cage smaller enough to keep a flea
00:03:21,00:03:22,and stop it from escaping.
00:03:22,00:03:24,"There's a poem by John Dunn called ""The Flea"","
00:03:24,00:03:27,which is talking about how the fleas bitten her.
00:03:27,00:03:28,"Now it's bitten him and he's saying,"
00:03:28,00:03:31,"oh, in the romantic, it's got both of us mingled in it."
00:03:31,00:03:33,"Oh, that's a good poem."
00:03:33,00:03:35,They all died of the plague soon after that.
00:03:35,00:03:39,"Which isn't caused by rats, again, right?"
00:03:39,00:03:41,I know this always comes around.
00:03:41,00:03:45,"Well, just on that subject of rats and us wearing lizards,"
00:03:45,00:03:47,"there's a nice little mouse that we've been giving back to,"
00:03:47,00:03:49,"which is a mouse that's going kind of,"
00:03:49,00:03:51,it's gone the endangered list.
00:03:51,00:03:54,And all the used balls from Wimbledon
00:03:54,00:03:57,have been donated as little houses for these mice.
00:03:57,00:03:58,That's very nice.
00:03:58,00:03:59,Yeah.
00:03:59,00:04:00,Eurasian harvest mice.
00:04:00,00:04:01,That's right.
00:04:01,00:04:03,"Yeah, so we should put a picture of on the website"
00:04:03,00:04:04,of them and these little homes.
00:04:04,00:04:08,I thought you were going to say the reverse of the lizard thing
00:04:08,00:04:12,is there's an animal that's been wearing a human in some way.
00:04:12,00:04:14,Is that what horses claim they're doing?
00:04:14,00:04:16,That's not my credit cesarean again.
00:04:16,00:04:19,"Yeah, the fashion for humans in tight trousers"
00:04:19,00:04:21,and long boots remains.
00:04:21,00:04:23,I do really like the origin of fashions
00:04:23,00:04:25,"that are quite normal, though."
00:04:25,00:04:26,I didn't know how people used to wear wigs
00:04:26,00:04:29,from the 17th century into the 19th century.
00:04:29,00:04:31,"That was because Louis, the 13th,"
00:04:31,00:04:33,had male patterned baldness.
00:04:33,00:04:36,And so he insisted on wearing wigs all the time to conceal that.
00:04:36,00:04:38,"They used to wear really massive wigs,"
00:04:38,00:04:40,and they're really ridiculous with things
00:04:40,00:04:43,in the wigs like a ship in a full sail
00:04:43,00:04:45,or a windmill with farm animals around it.
00:04:45,00:04:48,"And this massive wig, yeah."
00:04:48,00:04:49,"Sometimes they would, if there was something"
00:04:49,00:04:52,"would happen in the news, they would wear a wig"
00:04:52,00:04:55,which reflected what was happening in the news at the time.
00:04:55,00:04:57,No.
00:04:57,00:04:59,"And else, they were quite expensive these wigs."
00:04:59,00:05:03,"If you got a really good one, they were really status symbols."
00:05:03,00:05:06,And wig theft became a bit of a problem.
00:05:06,00:05:08,"What they would have is you would walk across, if you were a thief,"
00:05:08,00:05:11,"you'd walk across with a basket,"
00:05:11,00:05:13,and there'd be a young child inside the basket.
00:05:13,00:05:15,And then you would distract him for some reason.
00:05:15,00:05:17,"Then the child would pop out, grab the wig,"
00:05:17,00:05:20,pop back in into the basket and you'd run off.
00:05:20,00:05:21,"Oh, how many of those all good moments were there"
00:05:21,00:05:24,from cartoons where the children grabbed someone's hair
00:05:24,00:05:25,and it turned out not to be a wig.
00:05:25,00:05:27,And then...
00:05:27,00:05:29,"And people going, ""That's definitely my mate,"
00:05:29,00:05:32,"""Hindenburg Crash, that you're wearing on your head."""
00:05:32,00:05:33,What were on wig theft?
00:05:33,00:05:36,"Someone, a lot of people in the 1910s and 1920s,"
00:05:36,00:05:39,"there were bands on people bobbing their hair,"
00:05:39,00:05:40,whether that was locally enforced.
00:05:40,00:05:41,"There weren't any governmental bands on it,"
00:05:41,00:05:42,but it was very discouraged.
00:05:42,00:05:44,It was seen as being far too racy.
00:05:44,00:05:46,And at least one girl blamed her haircut
00:05:46,00:05:48,on what they called Jack the Clipper.
00:05:48,00:05:51,As in someone just leaned out and shot my hair.
00:05:51,00:05:53,So a girl in the Bronx said that a high-witman
00:05:53,00:05:54,had grabbed her and cut her hair off.
00:05:54,00:05:56,That sounds like someone where they
00:05:56,00:05:58,thought of the name of the criminal before.
00:05:58,00:06:02,Just speaking of things that had done
00:06:02,00:06:05,"one of my all-time favourite cuifax,"
00:06:05,00:06:06,this is just a sentence.
00:06:06,00:06:09,"In 1367, the French King, Charles V,"
00:06:09,00:06:12,prohibited the wearing of shoes shaped like penises.
00:06:12,00:06:17,Presumably because they were uncomfortable.
00:06:17,00:06:21,What happened was the front of the shoe would go very long.
00:06:21,00:06:23,And then they got longer and longer and longer.
00:06:23,00:06:25,"And then they got more sticky-upy,"
00:06:25,00:06:27,more sticky-upy because it became more fashionable.
00:06:27,00:06:28,"And then people thought,"
00:06:28,00:06:30,"""Oh, something long and sticky-upy,"
00:06:30,00:06:31,"why don't we make it into a penis?"""
00:06:31,00:06:33,And they did that and then they handed that out.
00:06:33,00:06:35,It's just one of my all-time favourite fads.
00:06:35,00:06:37,A lady Gaga would not have fit in in that court.
00:06:45,00:06:49,"OK, time for fact number two, this one's mine."
00:06:49,00:06:52,"My fact this week is that the great code breaker,"
00:06:52,00:06:55,"Alan Shurring, lost his buried treasure"
00:06:55,00:06:58,when he couldn't crack his own code.
00:06:58,00:07:01,"So Alan Shurring, for those, I guess,"
00:07:01,00:07:03,who don't quite know who he is.
00:07:03,00:07:06,"Yeah, he is a great mathematician and code breaker"
00:07:06,00:07:07,from Blechley Park.
00:07:07,00:07:09,He was very instrumental in helping to crack things
00:07:09,00:07:11,like the Enigma codes.
00:07:11,00:07:13,"And isn't he the, he's known as the father"
00:07:13,00:07:14,of modern computing?
00:07:14,00:07:16,"Yeah, the cheering test."
00:07:16,00:07:17,The cheering test is named after him.
00:07:17,00:07:19,"Yeah, so this is what happened."
00:07:19,00:07:20,This was in 1940.
00:07:20,00:07:24,Alan Shurring got really scared of a potential German invasion.
00:07:24,00:07:28,"So he converted all of his life savings into two bars of silver,"
00:07:28,00:07:31,which at the time were at about 250 pounds.
00:07:31,00:07:34,He wheeled them to some woods near Shanley
00:07:34,00:07:36,"and he buried them both under the forest floor,"
00:07:36,00:07:38,"one of them under the forest floor,"
00:07:38,00:07:41,one under a bridge by a bed of a stream.
00:07:41,00:07:43,He then made a code of where he buried it.
00:07:43,00:07:45,And then he made a code of the code.
00:07:45,00:07:47,And no one knows exactly how many codes are the codes
00:07:47,00:07:49,"that he made, but he made a number so that no one--"
00:07:49,00:07:50,Do we have the codes?
00:07:50,00:07:51,No.
00:07:51,00:07:53,Because I imagine it would be X marks a spot.
00:07:53,00:07:55,X equals Y.
00:07:55,00:07:58,Oh yeah.
00:07:58,00:08:01,"So five years later, he returns with a metal detector in hand."
00:08:01,00:08:04,And he goes to where he buried them
00:08:04,00:08:06,and he couldn't crack his own codes.
00:08:06,00:08:08,And he kept trying and kept trying and kept trying.
00:08:08,00:08:11,He did three expeditions to try and find his buried treasure
00:08:11,00:08:12,in each time.
00:08:12,00:08:13,He couldn't do it.
00:08:13,00:08:15,"And on top of it, in those five years,"
00:08:15,00:08:16,the landscape had changed.
00:08:16,00:08:18,Someone had knocked down the bridge
00:08:18,00:08:20,where he put it near the bed of the stream.
00:08:20,00:08:22,And so he never found it.
00:08:22,00:08:26,"And so unless someone has found it and not told anyone about it,"
00:08:26,00:08:29,Alan Turing's silver hoard is still buried somewhere in Shanley.
00:08:29,00:08:31,But we don't know what his code was to be.
00:08:31,00:08:33,"It was probably like, yeah, look at this bridge"
00:08:33,00:08:34,and there's a poppy field to your left.
00:08:34,00:08:37,"And I think the man who helped crack the enigma code,"
00:08:37,00:08:39,probably used something a bit more complex.
00:08:39,00:08:43,He can't take four hops towards the last year each.
00:08:43,00:08:46,It was a double bluff.
00:08:46,00:08:48,Three rolly polies for you.
00:08:48,00:08:49,"So simple, it's completely."
00:08:49,00:08:51,That's actually also how he cracked the enigma code
00:08:51,00:08:54,in the first place.
00:08:54,00:08:55,"So do you know who, if you find treasure in the UK,"
00:08:55,00:08:57,do you know who you report it to?
00:08:57,00:08:58,The local coroner.
00:08:58,00:09:01,So all he does is get his dead bodies and treasure reported to him.
00:09:01,00:09:05,"You know what you'd be hoping for, don't you?"
00:09:05,00:09:08,"In France, you can't metal detect without a license to do so."
00:09:08,00:09:10,And much stricter on it than we are.
00:09:10,00:09:11,So I don't know whether that means there's
00:09:11,00:09:12,"much more buried treasure in France,"
00:09:12,00:09:15,just because there aren't enthusiastic amateurs
00:09:15,00:09:17,going around the country and seeing what they can find.
00:09:17,00:09:19,"Yeah, because something like 90% of treasure"
00:09:19,00:09:21,in the UK is found by people with metal detects
00:09:21,00:09:22,"is just amateurs, I think."
00:09:22,00:09:24,Do you know how many coins you have to find for it
00:09:24,00:09:25,to qualify as like a hoard?
00:09:25,00:09:27,"You know, like he's just like a real hoarder."
00:09:27,00:09:29,He's got a hoard of 100.
00:09:29,00:09:29,I reckon not many.
00:09:29,00:09:31,I reckon 20.
00:09:31,00:09:32,"Yeah, it's two."
00:09:32,00:09:32,Two.
00:09:32,00:09:36,As long as they're at least 10% precious metal.
00:09:36,00:09:37,"Oh, it's great."
00:09:37,00:09:40,"I've got several hordes in my wallet, that's brilliant."
00:09:40,00:09:42,"Well, they have to be 300 years old at least, sorry."
00:09:42,00:09:42,I'm very thrifty.
00:09:42,00:09:45,So.
00:09:45,00:09:46,I'm very old.
00:09:46,00:09:48,So are you allowed to keep a coin?
00:09:48,00:09:50,But you're not allowed to keep a hoard?
00:09:50,00:09:51,Do you then have to go to the corner?
00:09:51,00:09:51,Yes.
00:09:51,00:09:53,"Couldn't you just say, oh, I found a coin,"
00:09:53,00:09:54,"then walk away for a bit, then walk back."
00:09:54,00:09:55,"Oh, another coin."
00:09:55,00:09:57,Another coin.
00:09:57,00:09:58,How much?
00:09:58,00:10:00,This is such a great idea.
00:10:00,00:10:00,I'll be excellent.
00:10:00,00:10:04,I found a coin 50 times.
00:10:04,00:10:07,They're going to have to rewrite the law right now.
00:10:07,00:10:10,There's a great story of a book that was published in 1979
00:10:10,00:10:11,in England.
00:10:11,00:10:14,It was kind of the world's first global treasure hunt.
00:10:14,00:10:18,And it was a book called The Masquerade by Kit Williams.
00:10:18,00:10:22,"It's only about 20 pages, and it's all illustrations."
00:10:22,00:10:23,And the story doesn't really matter.
00:10:23,00:10:25,"It's the fact that in every single page,"
00:10:25,00:10:29,there's hidden codes to the location
00:10:29,00:10:31,"of what the boy finds at the end of the story book, which"
00:10:31,00:10:33,is this golden masquerade hair.
00:10:33,00:10:35,And Kit Williams buried it somewhere in the world.
00:10:35,00:10:36,He didn't say where.
00:10:36,00:10:38,"And if you cracked the code of the book,"
00:10:38,00:10:40,you would find the masquerade hair.
00:10:40,00:10:40,Did anyone find it?
00:10:40,00:10:44,"Someone eventually did, but it really made people go insane"
00:10:44,00:10:47,"in the search for it, because they became obsessed with it."
00:10:47,00:10:49,"It was a really, really hard code to crack."
00:10:49,00:10:53,"People actually were sectioned for psychiatric help,"
00:10:53,00:10:56,"because they were so obsessed, and they were just--"
00:10:56,00:10:57,"Yeah, not getting to it."
00:10:57,00:11:00,"And unfortunately, the code was cracked by a couple,"
00:11:00,00:11:01,and they wrote the letter to Kit Williams
00:11:01,00:11:03,to say that we'd found it.
00:11:03,00:11:05,"And the day before that letter had arrived,"
00:11:05,00:11:07,"a neighboring person came to the house and said,"
00:11:07,00:11:08,"Kit, I've got the answer."
00:11:08,00:11:11,"I know where it is, and then dug it up."
00:11:11,00:11:14,"But they were told by one of Kit Williams' friends,"
00:11:14,00:11:15,the location.
00:11:15,00:11:16,So they cheated in order to get it.
00:11:16,00:11:17,"Oh, bust."
00:11:17,00:11:19,"So he told his friends, the location."
00:11:19,00:11:21,"Somehow, like he must have slipped in the pub"
00:11:21,00:11:22,or something.
00:11:22,00:11:23,I don't know what it was.
00:11:23,00:11:23,"Oh, damn it."
00:11:23,00:11:26,"Yeah, the person who did find it then"
00:11:26,00:11:29,"tried to replicate the experience with a computer game,"
00:11:29,00:11:32,but it became so expensive to make it.
00:11:32,00:11:34,And no one understood it once it came out.
00:11:34,00:11:35,"That the company went bankrupt, and he"
00:11:35,00:11:38,had to put the mass-grade hair itself up for auction.
00:11:38,00:11:39,It went up for auction in Sotheby's.
00:11:39,00:11:41,It was bought by an anonymous bidder.
00:11:41,00:11:44,"And since it was bought 30 something odd years ago,"
00:11:44,00:11:47,no one knows its location currently.
00:11:47,00:11:49,"Yeah, so it's still out there."
00:11:49,00:11:50,It's sliding.
00:11:50,00:11:51,"Yeah, get the car, though."
00:11:51,00:11:53,Yeah.
00:11:53,00:11:54,Just talking about lost things.
00:11:54,00:11:57,People always lose their pincoats on their credit cards
00:11:57,00:11:58,and whatever.
00:11:58,00:11:59,That happens all the time.
00:11:59,00:12:02,"And I saw an article in the independent from 1996,"
00:12:02,00:12:05,"which thought that in the future, instead of pincoats,"
00:12:05,00:12:07,people would use their fingerprints
00:12:07,00:12:10,to say who they are when they put their credit card in.
00:12:10,00:12:12,"People, obviously, are a little bit worried"
00:12:12,00:12:13,about whether that would work or not.
00:12:13,00:12:16,And so they managed to stop any worry
00:12:16,00:12:19,"by saying a similar program in South Africa,"
00:12:19,00:12:22,"which distributes payments to 450,000 pensioners,"
00:12:22,00:12:25,has resulted in only one attempt
00:12:25,00:12:29,to use an amputated finger in more than six years.
00:12:29,00:12:30,So that sounds pretty safe.
00:12:30,00:12:31,Wow.
00:12:31,00:12:33,That's just the one they found out about presumably.
00:12:33,00:12:35,"I mean, how many people with amputated fingers"
00:12:35,00:12:37,are there buried in someone's dungeon?
00:12:37,00:12:40,"When they had the line-up, they were like,"
00:12:40,00:12:41,points are the guy who did this.
00:12:41,00:12:43,[LAUGHTER]
00:12:43,00:12:47,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:12:47,00:12:49,"OK, mine's from fact number three,"
00:12:49,00:12:52,"and we're going to do you, Anna."
00:12:52,00:12:56,"Yeah, my effect is that in 2011, the largest sperm bank"
00:12:56,00:12:59,in the world stopped accepting sperm from retets.
00:12:59,00:13:00,They swore.
00:13:00,00:13:01,They swore at each other.
00:13:01,00:13:04,"Well, it was a supply and demand issue, I think."
00:13:04,00:13:07,It was cryos international sperm bank in Denmark.
00:13:07,00:13:10,I think Denmark calls itself the sperm capital of the world
00:13:10,00:13:11,because there--
00:13:11,00:13:13,Is that really right but the airport?
00:13:13,00:13:13,"Yes, it is."
00:13:13,00:13:16,[LAUGHTER]
00:13:16,00:13:17,They're very proud of it.
00:13:17,00:13:18,"Everyone in Denmark, whenever they answer phone,"
00:13:18,00:13:21,"has to say, welcome to Denmark, sperm capital of the world."
00:13:21,00:13:21,That's true.
00:13:21,00:13:23,So was the sperm bank capital?
00:13:23,00:13:25,"Sperm bank capital, yeah, I don't think"
00:13:25,00:13:26,they just have really well-independent.
00:13:26,00:13:27,I actually use the sperm building society.
00:13:27,00:13:29,I think it's more ethical.
00:13:29,00:13:32,There's a lovely fact of just the idea
00:13:32,00:13:35,"of having that logo on at the airport that in Scotland,"
00:13:35,00:13:38,they spent the tourism board spent hundreds of thousands
00:13:38,00:13:41,of pounds trying to refine a great slogan
00:13:41,00:13:43,to arrive to for all of Scotland.
00:13:43,00:13:46,"And after brainstorms that lasted for however long,"
00:13:46,00:13:47,"hundreds of thousands of pounds,"
00:13:47,00:13:50,they arrived at welcome to Scotland.
00:13:50,00:13:52,"That's the oldies of the goodies, aren't they?"
00:13:52,00:13:53,"Sorry, Anna, go on."
00:13:53,00:13:56,"Yeah, so there's a quote from Ollie Schoo."
00:13:56,00:13:57,"And he says, there are too many."
00:13:57,00:14:00,So he runs the sperm bank in Denmark.
00:14:00,00:14:01,Cryous international sperm bank.
00:14:01,00:14:04,"And he said, there are too many redheads in relation to demand."
00:14:04,00:14:07,"I do not think you choose a redhead unless the partner,"
00:14:07,00:14:09,"for example, the sterile male, has red hair,"
00:14:09,00:14:12,or because the lone woman has a preference for redheads.
00:14:12,00:14:16,"And that's perhaps not so many, especially in the latter case."
00:14:16,00:14:17,"Anyway, it's obviously not fair,"
00:14:17,00:14:19,because there's absolutely nothing wrong with redheads.
00:14:19,00:14:22,Just want to make that clear as the QI view.
00:14:22,00:14:26,"And he also stopped accepting Ollie Schoo,"
00:14:26,00:14:30,"stopped accepting donations from a lot of Scandinavians as well,"
00:14:30,00:14:33,because they export a lot of their sperm internationally.
00:14:33,00:14:35,And there's not so people like to have children
00:14:35,00:14:37,that kind of look like them.
00:14:37,00:14:39,"Wow, what a weird way of making your country bigger"
00:14:39,00:14:40,on the global map.
00:14:40,00:14:42,"10% of their sperm go to Britain, in fact."
00:14:42,00:14:44,"And he just wraps them up in a little package,"
00:14:44,00:14:46,"sends them, you can receive it in the post,"
00:14:46,00:14:49,"and then you can, like, it's all DIY, order it online."
00:14:49,00:14:50,Really?
00:14:50,00:14:51,What? So it comes refrigerated?
00:14:51,00:14:53,Or what customs just sort of wave it through?
00:14:53,00:14:54,I believe so.
00:14:54,00:14:55,Wow.
00:14:55,00:14:56,Yeah.
00:14:56,00:14:58,So it's not over the liquids amount.
00:14:58,00:14:59,A lot of it.
00:14:59,00:15:00,"I mean, don't think so."
00:15:00,00:15:02,I know something which is over the liquids amount.
00:15:02,00:15:04,"Unfortunately, this was in 2011."
00:15:04,00:15:06,There were lots of zerofishers trying to establish a sperm bank
00:15:06,00:15:09,"for elephants in North America, because there aren't enough"
00:15:09,00:15:13,"elephants, and they're going to start becoming too closely"
00:15:13,00:15:16,related to each other in a week in the gene pool.
00:15:16,00:15:19,So 16 liters of elephant semen were
00:15:19,00:15:23,"being kept in South African export office,"
00:15:23,00:15:25,because American import had no idea
00:15:25,00:15:26,what to classify it as.
00:15:26,00:15:28,There's a lot of bureaucracy in the USA.
00:15:28,00:15:32,So it was just kept waiting there frozen in limbo for ages.
00:15:32,00:15:35,And I think it might still be there.
00:15:35,00:15:37,And that was three years ago.
00:15:37,00:15:40,So there's 16 liters of semen waiting somewhere
00:15:40,00:15:41,as part of Project Frozen Dumbo.
00:15:41,00:15:45,[LAUGHTER]
00:15:45,00:15:46,Shouldn't have declared.
00:15:46,00:15:48,Should have just gone through questions.
00:15:48,00:15:50,This has gone through.
00:15:50,00:15:51,"There's over 100 miles, very tricky."
00:15:51,00:15:53,You'd have to have a lot of tiny bottles of shampoo.
00:15:53,00:15:55,Yeah.
00:15:55,00:15:57,She goes in the 90% of your sperm is deformed.
00:15:57,00:15:59,You three specifically.
00:15:59,00:16:00,I told that all the time.
00:16:00,00:16:02,[LAUGHTER]
00:16:02,00:16:03,So long.
00:16:03,00:16:04,What do you mean?
00:16:04,00:16:07,90% of men's sperm has either two heads or two
00:16:07,00:16:10,"tail, or multiple heads and tails, or a coiled tail,"
00:16:10,00:16:11,or a broken tail.
00:16:11,00:16:14,So you mean superhero?
00:16:14,00:16:15,"Yeah, yeah, OK."
00:16:15,00:16:16,Superhuman.
00:16:16,00:16:19,"But a lot of these men actually get the clip,"
00:16:19,00:16:23,"so they can't have babies, by a notorious villain known"
00:16:23,00:16:26,as Jack the Sniffer.
00:16:26,00:16:29,He's killing the superheroes before they're born.
00:16:29,00:16:33,"For me, when I hear the word redheads as an Australian,"
00:16:33,00:16:36,I immediately think of our matches.
00:16:36,00:16:39,"Because in Australia, that's the leading brand of matches."
00:16:39,00:16:40,They're called redheads.
00:16:40,00:16:42,"Redheads were originally made in Australia,"
00:16:42,00:16:46,but then they got outsourced to Sweden.
00:16:46,00:16:47,And so they were no longer an Australian product.
00:16:47,00:16:49,And we have a guy in Australia called Dick Smith.
00:16:49,00:16:53,"And he runs Dick Smith's electronics, Dick Smith's Foods."
00:16:53,00:16:56,And he's kind of Australia's Richard Branson.
00:16:56,00:17:00,And he decided that he wasn't going to allow redheads
00:17:00,00:17:02,to become the leading brand of Australian matches.
00:17:02,00:17:04,"So he created his own brand, which you can buy and shop."
00:17:04,00:17:05,So I think you can still buy them.
00:17:05,00:17:09,"And they're called Dickheads, his Dick Smith Dickheads."
00:17:09,00:17:13,And Dickheads became a hugely popular product in Australia.
00:17:13,00:17:15,"That reminds me a little bit of, do you"
00:17:15,00:17:19,know about redhead day in the Netherlands?
00:17:19,00:17:20,It's a summer festival.
00:17:20,00:17:23,It takes place each first weekend of September
00:17:23,00:17:24,in the city of Brayda.
00:17:24,00:17:27,And all the redheads from around the world
00:17:27,00:17:30,come along and have fun and party.
00:17:30,00:17:31,It's very popular.
00:17:31,00:17:33,"But for the first few years, it wasn't so popular"
00:17:33,00:17:36,because it clashed with a local pumpkin contest.
00:17:36,00:17:38,But now it's--
00:17:38,00:17:39,Which orange to choose?
00:17:39,00:17:40,Is that what they're doing?
00:17:40,00:17:42,Why do redheads get such a hard time?
00:17:42,00:17:43,I've never understood that.
00:17:43,00:17:44,Neither of us.
00:17:44,00:17:45,I always wanted to be redhead.
00:17:45,00:17:46,"Yeah, it means you're special."
00:17:46,00:17:47,Yeah.
00:17:47,00:17:48,The Irish like redheads.
00:17:48,00:17:51,There's a high demand still for redheads amongst the Irish.
00:17:51,00:17:52,They're still asking for redheads.
00:17:52,00:17:54,"Apparently very popular in Germany as well,"
00:17:54,00:17:58,though as a sex researcher called Professor Dr. Werner Habermel.
00:17:58,00:18:01,"And he said, the sex lives of women with red hair"
00:18:01,00:18:04,"is clearly more active than those with other hair color,"
00:18:04,00:18:07,with more partners and having sex more often than the average.
00:18:07,00:18:11,I find it quite interesting that the human sperm cell
00:18:11,00:18:14,is the smallest cell in the human body.
00:18:14,00:18:16,"And a lot of people know the egg, the female egg,"
00:18:16,00:18:18,"is one of the largest, I think."
00:18:18,00:18:23,But a blue whale sperm is only a very tiny amount longer
00:18:23,00:18:24,than a human's one.
00:18:24,00:18:25,"Oh, it's interesting."
00:18:25,00:18:28,So it's completely different by species.
00:18:28,00:18:30,"Yeah, it's totally random."
00:18:30,00:18:31,I don't know people-- I don't know why.
00:18:31,00:18:33,They certainly don't know why the fruit fly sperm is so big.
00:18:33,00:18:36,"And yeah, why have a small sperm or a big sperm?"
00:18:36,00:18:38,"Several times as long as the actual fruit fly, isn't it?"
00:18:38,00:18:38,20 times.
00:18:38,00:18:39,20 times as long.
00:18:39,00:18:41,Although I couldn't work at the work this out.
00:18:41,00:18:45,So the average male ejaculate is half a teaspoon.
00:18:45,00:18:49,And that's where the bang got its name from.
00:18:49,00:18:50,Really?
00:18:50,00:18:50,I didn't know that.
00:18:50,00:18:54,"brackets, I haven't also heard of the band."
00:18:54,00:18:56,It contains 200 million sperm.
00:18:56,00:18:59,"If you lined up all the sperm in one ejaculate,"
00:18:59,00:19:01,it'd stretch six miles.
00:19:01,00:19:03,So you managed to get your sperm into one line.
00:19:03,00:19:04,It's six miles up.
00:19:04,00:19:05,I don't know.
00:19:05,00:19:07,"If you're asking them all to queue up in the blink,"
00:19:07,00:19:10,you need a spatula or something.
00:19:10,00:19:13,You with two heads to the back.
00:19:13,00:19:16,The man who first discovered the man who first saw sperm
00:19:16,00:19:20,under a microscope who was called Van Liewenhook.
00:19:20,00:19:22,So he discovered them in 1677.
00:19:22,00:19:24,"He was very clear whenever he wrote about it,"
00:19:24,00:19:25,I'll spoke about that.
00:19:25,00:19:27,The sperm that I found were not obtained
00:19:27,00:19:29,"by any sinful contrivance on my part,"
00:19:29,00:19:31,but were the excess which nature provided me
00:19:31,00:19:33,in conjugal relation.
00:19:33,00:19:37,One thing I found is that it takes five people
00:19:37,00:19:39,to get semen out of a vulture.
00:19:39,00:19:40,Right.
00:19:40,00:19:43,Is that your first hand experience?
00:19:43,00:19:44,I've got that news for you.
00:19:44,00:19:47,"Andy, there's only four of us."
00:19:47,00:19:51,What am I going to do with this guy?
00:19:51,00:19:53,"No, one person takes the limbs, one takes the head,"
00:19:53,00:19:55,"one takes the wings, a fourth person massages it back."
00:19:55,00:19:58,"So after the massage, the bird gets aroused"
00:19:58,00:19:59,"and then it's a cloaca appears, which"
00:19:59,00:20:02,is like the sexual opening that my spurts have.
00:20:02,00:20:05,And then so the fourth person then grabs the cloaca
00:20:05,00:20:09,"between Tham and index finger, at which point the fifth person"
00:20:09,00:20:10,collects the semen in a glass funnel.
00:20:10,00:20:12,All receptacle of their choice.
00:20:12,00:20:14,It doesn't matter.
00:20:14,00:20:15,"Once you've gone to that much effort, though,"
00:20:15,00:20:17,you may as well get a glass funnel.
00:20:17,00:20:19,And that's the stag night over.
00:20:19,00:20:21,[LAUGHTER]
00:20:21,00:20:27,"OK, final fact of the show."
00:20:27,00:20:29,And we head over to Andy Murray.
00:20:29,00:20:31,My fact is that the English language
00:20:31,00:20:35,"has more words borrowed from Hawaiian than it has from Welsh,"
00:20:35,00:20:36,which is surprising.
00:20:36,00:20:38,"Yeah, because it's quite a long way away, Hawaiian."
00:20:38,00:20:41,And whereas Wales is quite close.
00:20:41,00:20:42,Almost next door.
00:20:42,00:20:44,[LAUGHTER]
00:20:44,00:20:45,So let me think.
00:20:45,00:20:49,So maybe that is because things in Hawaii are more unusual
00:20:49,00:20:52,"to us, things that are in Wales, we just"
00:20:52,00:20:53,use the English words for our past.
00:20:53,00:20:56,"Well, possibly, but there seems to be a theory"
00:20:56,00:20:59,"that it's actually snobbery, that it was Anglo-Saxon snobbery"
00:20:59,00:21:01,that repressed the Welsh language.
00:21:01,00:21:04,And it was suppressed for a long time in the 19th century.
00:21:04,00:21:07,"So this is acclaimed by Dr. Philip Durkin,"
00:21:07,00:21:09,who's the author of borrowed words.
00:21:09,00:21:11,And he's also the deputy editor of the OED.
00:21:11,00:21:12,So he knows his stuff.
00:21:12,00:21:14,And he's ranked a lot of different languages in terms
00:21:14,00:21:17,of how many words from them have ended up in the OED.
00:21:17,00:21:20,And Latin comes first and French comes second.
00:21:20,00:21:26,"But Hawaiian manages to beat Welsh, as does Turkish and Icelandic."
00:21:26,00:21:27,Hawaiian words that we have include things
00:21:27,00:21:30,"like a hula hoop from Hula, the hula does,"
00:21:30,00:21:33,"ukulele, aloha, and wiki, which means quickly."
00:21:33,00:21:35,So wikipedia.
00:21:35,00:21:37,"So if you go to Hawaii, I've been to Hawaii,"
00:21:37,00:21:40,"and if you get a bus from the airport to wherever you need to go,"
00:21:40,00:21:43,"they're called wiki, wiki buses, because they're quinks, right?"
00:21:43,00:21:45,There's a bunch of words that I think someone
00:21:45,00:21:47,recently wrote a book on was that the English language
00:21:47,00:21:48,"used to have that we should bring back,"
00:21:48,00:21:52,"but the only one that springs to mind is fizzle,"
00:21:52,00:21:56,"which used to mean in the 15th and 16th centuries,"
00:21:56,00:21:59,"it was a verb, it meant to break wind without making a noise."
00:21:59,00:22:01,"Which you don't have anymore, but apparently, yeah."
00:22:01,00:22:03,Fizzle is where we get the word feisty from.
00:22:03,00:22:07,"Andy, you actually have invented new words, haven't you,"
00:22:07,00:22:10,for you were one of the kind of silent authors
00:22:10,00:22:13,of the new meaning of the lift book after this.
00:22:13,00:22:15,"It was a book there, what was it, Andy?"
00:22:15,00:22:15,It's a book there.
00:22:15,00:22:17,"It's a book of things that there should be words for,"
00:22:17,00:22:18,but aren't.
00:22:18,00:22:21,"So the original one was in the 80s, and it was one of the words,"
00:22:21,00:22:24,"and that was Abilene, which is the pleasant coolness"
00:22:24,00:22:25,"on the other side of a pillow, which is lovely."
00:22:25,00:22:27,There's no word for that on a hot night when you turn
00:22:27,00:22:29,"your pillow over, oh, it's so nice."
00:22:29,00:22:32,"So all the words in it, all the definitions"
00:22:32,00:22:34,"of real place names from around the world,"
00:22:34,00:22:36,matched with things that--
00:22:36,00:22:38,Experiences that don't yet have a word to condense them.
00:22:38,00:22:39,"Exactly, yes."
00:22:39,00:22:42,"So Angram, an amusing anagram you've come up with,"
00:22:42,00:22:45,"which doesn't quite work, for example."
00:22:45,00:22:47,"Or Dambi Whisk, which is the bit of kitchen equipment,"
00:22:47,00:22:50,"that you don't know what it's for, but it always"
00:22:50,00:22:52,means that you can't quite shut the drawer properly.
00:22:52,00:22:53,And you have to sort of charm it in.
00:22:53,00:22:56,"So that kind of stuff, that's great."
00:22:56,00:22:59,"Going to the Welsh thing, there are several thousand people"
00:22:59,00:23:03,in Patagonia in Argentina who descended from the Welsh
00:23:03,00:23:05,and speak Welsh and Spanish as their two main languages.
00:23:05,00:23:08,There are nearly as many Welsh speakers there
00:23:08,00:23:09,as their own Wales.
00:23:09,00:23:10,That's bizarre.
00:23:10,00:23:10,Yeah.
00:23:10,00:23:13,"I really love it when language gets kind of preserved,"
00:23:13,00:23:15,because you're in an isolated place.
00:23:15,00:23:16,I remember going to North Carolina
00:23:16,00:23:18,and being right on the coastline.
00:23:18,00:23:20,"And obviously, that's where some of the first people"
00:23:20,00:23:22,landed from a South-West coast.
00:23:22,00:23:25,And everyone there spoke with kind of a really thick Devonshire
00:23:25,00:23:26,accent.
00:23:26,00:23:27,It's so weird.
00:23:27,00:23:28,So you're in North Carolina.
00:23:28,00:23:30,And people are talking like this to you.
00:23:30,00:23:32,I'm not very good at that accent.
00:23:32,00:23:34,"I'll be proud to present Palmerston Island, I think,"
00:23:34,00:23:36,in the middle of the Pacific.
00:23:36,00:23:38,And they all speak with a Gloucestershire accent.
00:23:38,00:23:39,"Yeah, that's so clear."
00:23:39,00:23:40,This is not a real island.
00:23:40,00:23:41,"Oh, really?"
00:23:41,00:23:43,"My favourite word is Grockel, which is a Devon word,"
00:23:43,00:23:44,which means somebody's not from around here.
00:23:44,00:23:45,"Yeah, that's good."
00:23:45,00:23:46,Very definitely.
00:23:46,00:23:47,I'm not from Grockel.
00:23:47,00:23:49,"The Hawaiians have a word for that, actually."
00:23:49,00:23:52,"How, how, how, how, how, how, something like that,"
00:23:52,00:23:54,which means someone who's not from around there.
00:23:54,00:23:54,"Oh, yeah."
00:23:54,00:23:55,"Yeah, yeah."
00:23:55,00:23:57,"There are some other Hawaiian words,"
00:23:57,00:23:59,"which we should probably borrow in a bit,"
00:23:59,00:24:01,similar to what we do with Afterlif.
00:24:01,00:24:03,These are quite cool words.
00:24:03,00:24:06,Makahaka-haka is someone with deep-set eyeballs.
00:24:06,00:24:07,Which is very good.
00:24:07,00:24:08,"Oh, that's me."
00:24:08,00:24:09,I've got deep-set eyes.
00:24:09,00:24:09,Is it?
00:24:09,00:24:10,"Oh, yeah."
00:24:10,00:24:13,"If you're listening at home, we can barely see Danzai's,"
00:24:13,00:24:14,because they're just so far away.
00:24:14,00:24:17,[LAUGHTER]
00:24:17,00:24:18,There's another one.
00:24:18,00:24:21,"It's Ulaia, which means to live like a hermit"
00:24:21,00:24:23,because of disappointment.
00:24:23,00:24:24,Wow.
00:24:24,00:24:25,"Oh, my god, that's amazing."
00:24:25,00:24:26,It's very specific as well.
00:24:26,00:24:28,The fact that you need a word for that implies
00:24:28,00:24:29,that there are a lot of people living as hermits
00:24:29,00:24:31,because of disappointment.
00:24:31,00:24:32,[LAUGHTER]
00:24:32,00:24:34,They should meet up and not be hermits anymore.
00:24:34,00:24:35,That is just--
00:24:35,00:24:37,This is completely off-topic.
00:24:37,00:24:39,But do you know that thing about the hermits
00:24:39,00:24:41,in like the first of the fourth century?
00:24:41,00:24:43,It was a fashion for people who were religious
00:24:43,00:24:46,to go and live in the desert as a hermit.
00:24:46,00:24:48,"A few people did it, and then it became more fashionable,"
00:24:48,00:24:50,"and more fashionable, and more fashionable still."
00:24:50,00:24:53,And then you have all these writings of these hermits
00:24:53,00:24:54,"living in the desert going, I can't move"
00:24:54,00:24:56,for all these other hermits.
00:24:56,00:24:57,It's just totally hermit.
00:24:57,00:24:59,I read the other day that one of the things
00:24:59,00:25:01,that people used to do to sort out their melancholy--
00:25:01,00:25:04,this was the rich back in the days--
00:25:04,00:25:06,"that they would hire a hermit to live on their grounds,"
00:25:06,00:25:07,and they would build a hermitage.
00:25:07,00:25:09,"And they would go and talk to that hermit,"
00:25:09,00:25:11,"and then they would let the problem sit with the hermit,"
00:25:11,00:25:14,and the hermit would then just mull on them on their behalf.
00:25:14,00:25:16,"But sometimes, if you couldn't afford the hermit,"
00:25:16,00:25:18,they would often just build the hermitage.
00:25:18,00:25:22,They would leave items in particular positions.
00:25:22,00:25:23,So they looked like the hermit was just--
00:25:23,00:25:24,he'd just gone out for a walk.
00:25:24,00:25:26,He was showing off to your rich friends.
00:25:26,00:25:27,"Oh, I've got a hermit."
00:25:27,00:25:29,"Oh, he must be out of the moment."
00:25:29,00:25:31,He's out socialising.
00:25:31,00:25:32,He's gone out on the town.
00:25:32,00:25:34,"You don't really need to do that, because all you have to do"
00:25:34,00:25:35,"is say, oh, he's a hermit."
00:25:35,00:25:36,He doesn't like to be disfigured.
00:25:36,00:25:38,I don't think that's true.
00:25:38,00:25:39,I can't believe there was a theory
00:25:39,00:25:41,that it might make you less melancholy
00:25:41,00:25:44,to go and rearrange the furniture in your fake hermitage house.
00:25:44,00:25:46,It sounds like I would walk out of that house
00:25:46,00:25:49,and commit suicide immediately.
00:25:49,00:25:52,What's my life at a girl?
00:25:52,00:25:54,Somebody from the University of Leicester School
00:25:54,00:25:56,in English who was researching the hermit thing
00:25:56,00:25:59,"said that they would leave reading matter and glasses out,"
00:25:59,00:26:02,a bit like leaving Cheryale for Father Christmas.
00:26:02,00:26:03,So--
00:26:03,00:26:04,"Yeah, so to look like he was there."
00:26:04,00:26:05,And yeah.
00:26:05,00:26:06,I think that's quite charming.
00:26:06,00:26:07,"Yeah, yeah."
00:26:07,00:26:09,And then they'd pretend to turn the pages
00:26:09,00:26:10,and put a bit more on kind of new page.
00:26:10,00:26:11,We're more on kind of it every day.
00:26:11,00:26:12,Yeah.
00:26:12,00:26:16,"Oh, he's really got a long way with Little Dorit."
00:26:16,00:26:19,"Words that we do get just going back to Welsh,"
00:26:19,00:26:20,because we've gone so far off topic.
00:26:20,00:26:22,But words that we do get from Welsh
00:26:22,00:26:26,"include flannel, flummery, corgi, and dad."
00:26:26,00:26:27,Dad.
00:26:27,00:26:28,Yeah.
00:26:28,00:26:29,"That was a pretty big hit, sir."
00:26:29,00:26:30,But not mom.
00:26:30,00:26:31,"No, not mom."
00:26:31,00:26:36,Isn't Ma the universal word from mother as a result of all babies?
00:26:36,00:26:38,It's pretty youthful.
00:26:38,00:26:39,But there is a place.
00:26:39,00:26:41,"And I think it's Georgia or Armenia,"
00:26:41,00:26:43,where the word for mother is dada.
00:26:43,00:26:44,Yeah.
00:26:44,00:26:46,It's one of very few places in the world.
00:26:46,00:26:47,"The corgi thing's quite interesting,"
00:26:47,00:26:51,because it means that the correct plural of corgi
00:26:51,00:26:55,"is cauguin, because that's the way the Welsh plural is made."
00:26:55,00:26:57,You have another thing about plurals.
00:26:57,00:27:00,"The one is whenever I go to a sandwich shop,"
00:27:00,00:27:05,"I get very annoyed if I ask Panini, and they only give me one."
00:27:05,00:27:08,"Because Panini is plural, and it should be--"
00:27:08,00:27:10,and I always ask for a Panino if I only want one of them.
00:27:10,00:27:12,You're going to be perpetually disappointed.
00:27:12,00:27:14,That is such a lovely god.
00:27:14,00:27:17,"And I never invite a QIL 30 kind of shop,"
00:27:17,00:27:20,because you're just going to be bantic at the hour and every day.
00:27:20,00:27:21,"Actually, there's no such thing as a fish."
00:27:21,00:27:22,Get out of my fish and chip shop.
00:27:22,00:27:25,"You're one of the QILs, aren't you?"
00:27:25,00:27:27,Do you know what the state fish of Hawaii is?
00:27:27,00:27:30,"No, I'm going to tell you."
00:27:30,00:27:35,"It's the Humu, Humu, Nuku, Nuku, A-Pu, A-A."
00:27:35,00:27:37,"This is why we took from Hawaiian, rather than from Welsh,"
00:27:37,00:27:39,"because they've lost so many vowels, and vowels"
00:27:39,00:27:41,"are really easy to pronounce, aren't they?"
00:27:41,00:27:45,"Hawaiian word, Humu, A-E-O-I-A, meaning certified,"
00:27:45,00:27:47,has the most consecutive vowels of any word
00:27:47,00:27:49,in the current human speech.
00:27:49,00:27:52,"Just kind of sounds like they're drunk all the time, isn't it?"
00:27:52,00:27:54,If you're just alighting too many vowels--
00:27:54,00:27:55,Sounds better than they're cornish.
00:27:55,00:27:57,Yeah.
00:27:57,00:27:59,I'll see you later.
00:27:59,00:28:00,"OK, we should wrap up."
00:28:00,00:28:01,"Just one final thing, Anna."
00:28:01,00:28:03,"One final thing, phonetomology."
00:28:03,00:28:06,The first known use of the word abracadabra
00:28:06,00:28:09,"was from the third century, seems kind of weird to me,"
00:28:09,00:28:11,because he would have thought it was like a modern--
00:28:11,00:28:13,"I don't know, it sounds like such a weird modern concoction,"
00:28:13,00:28:15,but it was used in the third century by a doctor
00:28:15,00:28:17,who prescribed it as an anti-malarial.
00:28:17,00:28:19,"It was one of the first proposed cures for malaria, and you--"
00:28:19,00:28:21,Just to say abracadabra?
00:28:21,00:28:23,"Yeah, you actually have to wear it around your neck"
00:28:23,00:28:24,"and an amulet, too."
00:28:24,00:28:26,But I like the idea of someone going to the doctor.
00:28:26,00:28:28,"He's like, I'm feeling not very good."
00:28:28,00:28:29,I think I'm a malaria.
00:28:29,00:28:31,"Oh, I've got the one thing for you."
00:28:31,00:28:32,Abracadabra!
00:28:32,00:28:33,Abracadabra!
00:28:33,00:28:34,Yeah.
00:28:34,00:28:35,"Thanks, I feel much better."
00:28:35,00:28:42,"OK, that's it for our episode."
00:28:42,00:28:43,That's all our facts.
