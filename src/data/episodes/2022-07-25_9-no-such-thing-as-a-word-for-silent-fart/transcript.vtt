WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680
 We run it on QI a few years ago.

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.160
 Yeah.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.360
 And which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.640
 It's kind of the nicer thing as a fish.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.040
 No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.520
 It says it right there, first paragraph, no such thing as a fish.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:26.200
 Hello, and welcome to another edition of "No Such Thing As A Fish"

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.960
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.120
 in Culverant Garden.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.520
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.800
 I'm sitting here with three other QI elves, James,

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.400
 Markin, Hanuch, Zinsky, and Andy Murray.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.680
 And once again, we've gathered around the microphones

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.280
 to share our favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.720
 So, in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.840
 James, let's begin with you.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.160
 OK, yeah, my fat this week is it was fashionable in New York

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.840
 at the end of the 19th century for ladies

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.960
 to wear live lizards as broaches.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:58.800
 Wow.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.000
 With a pin on them?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.280
 Well, actually, with a small leash, it seems.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.600
 This was an article in the archive of The New York Times

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.080
 about the RSPCA complaining about it.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.760
 I'm surprising.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.680
 Yeah, I mean, let me give you a few little bits.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.920
 The lizards have been sold as chameleons.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.120
 They were fastened to cushions by means of tiny colors and chains,

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.080
 and they have become quite a plaything with many people.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.680
 Sometimes they were worn in the streets by women

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.480
 who had them attached to their bodices.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.560
 It doesn't really give any more information than that.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.440
 And was this popular?

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.920
 Was it, did a lot of people do it?

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.000
 I imagine it didn't last for very long because the RSPCA

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.600
 in the New York Times got involved.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.800
 Are there any other animals that we've known to have worn?

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.600
 Yes, which really recently, maybe used all this as well.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.240
 And I don't really know why I don't remember this.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.840
 Apparently, in 2006, there was a fashion designer

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.480
 who designed cockroach broaches.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.960
 I think mainly because of the rhyming thing.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.800
 But they became quite a popular thing.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.680
 And there was a live cockroach on a brooch.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.080
 And so they were decorated with like,

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.840
 ornate jewelry and painted gold and stuff.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.080
 And apparently they could last up to a year.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.240
 And they just crawled around using it.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.520
 I think Paris Hilton got one.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.400
 Women used to keep the small pets in their moths.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.560
 They would decorate their moths with jewels

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.760
 and they would put pets in there.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.080
 And for a while, it was like a status symbol.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.360
 The larger your moth was, the more rich you were.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.360
 So if you get a horse in there, a 16-hander,

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.640
 then that's impressive.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.680
 People are going, she must be a princess or something.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.880
 She has a moth that fits a horse in.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.720
 People would be impressed, yes?

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.800
 There was another live animal that people used, apparently,

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.520
 in the Middle Ages.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.640
 One recommended cure for the plague

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.920
 was strapping a live chicken around the bubos on your body.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:39.440
 Oh, yeah.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.120
 That work?

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.920
 No, no, that's why a third of Europe died.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.080
 I find that amazing.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.120
 They used to think that if you got bitten by a snake,

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.320
 that if you put a live pigeon on the bite,

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.240
 the bottom of a pigeon, it would suck out the venom.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.080
 That's right.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.320
 Yeah, and you would consistently use more and more pigeons

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.200
 until the final anus sucking pigeon didn't die.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.560
 And then you knew you got all the poison out.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.800
 I have a very dim memory of people in China, a thousand,

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.160
 or so years ago, keeping something, a little insect

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.360
 in a cage around their necks, which had drunk their lovers blood.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.640
 Yeah, that would happen in Europe with fleas.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.480
 Fleas, that's it.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.640
 But I can't imagine a cage smaller enough to keep a flea

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.880
 and stop it from escaping.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.560
 There's a poem by John Dunn called "The Flea",

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.280
 which is talking about how the fleas bitten her.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.440
 Now it's bitten him and he's saying,

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.840
 oh, in the romantic, it's got both of us mingled in it.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.560
 Oh, that's a good poem.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.560
 They all died of the plague soon after that.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.800
 Which isn't caused by rats, again, right?

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.000
 I know this always comes around.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.040
 Well, just on that subject of rats and us wearing lizards,

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.840
 there's a nice little mouse that we've been giving back to,

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.760
 which is a mouse that's going kind of,

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.960
 it's gone the endangered list.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.400
 And all the used balls from Wimbledon

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.360
 have been donated as little houses for these mice.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.200
 That's very nice.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.040
 Yeah.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.320
 Eurasian harvest mice.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.000
 That's right.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.440
 Yeah, so we should put a picture of on the website

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.760
 of them and these little homes.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.200
 I thought you were going to say the reverse of the lizard thing

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.520
 is there's an animal that's been wearing a human in some way.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.880
 Is that what horses claim they're doing?

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.600
 That's not my credit cesarean again.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.200
 Yeah, the fashion for humans in tight trousers

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.560
 and long boots remains.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.600
 I do really like the origin of fashions

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.000
 that are quite normal, though.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.960
 I didn't know how people used to wear wigs

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.240
 from the 17th century into the 19th century.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.800
 That was because Louis, the 13th,

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.320
 had male patterned baldness.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.680
 And so he insisted on wearing wigs all the time to conceal that.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.400
 They used to wear really massive wigs,

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.880
 and they're really ridiculous with things

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.840
 in the wigs like a ship in a full sail

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.960
 or a windmill with farm animals around it.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.040
 And this massive wig, yeah.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.560
 Sometimes they would, if there was something

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.160
 would happen in the news, they would wear a wig

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.800
 which reflected what was happening in the news at the time.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.320
 No.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.280
 And else, they were quite expensive these wigs.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.280
 If you got a really good one, they were really status symbols.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.360
 And wig theft became a bit of a problem.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.960
 What they would have is you would walk across, if you were a thief,

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.400
 you'd walk across with a basket,

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.840
 and there'd be a young child inside the basket.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.520
 And then you would distract him for some reason.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.680
 Then the child would pop out, grab the wig,

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.080
 pop back in into the basket and you'd run off.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.920
 Oh, how many of those all good moments were there

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.080
 from cartoons where the children grabbed someone's hair

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.840
 and it turned out not to be a wig.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.760
 And then...

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.640
 And people going, "That's definitely my mate,

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.640
 "Hindenburg Crash, that you're wearing on your head."

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:33.920
 What were on wig theft?

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.720
 Someone, a lot of people in the 1910s and 1920s,

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.000
 there were bands on people bobbing their hair,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 whether that was locally enforced.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.400
 There weren't any governmental bands on it,

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.720
 but it was very discouraged.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.480
 It was seen as being far too racy.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.600
 And at least one girl blamed her haircut

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.800
 on what they called Jack the Clipper.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.760
 As in someone just leaned out and shot my hair.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.560
 So a girl in the Bronx said that a high-witman

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.960
 had grabbed her and cut her hair off.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.800
 That sounds like someone where they

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.880
 thought of the name of the criminal before.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.960
 Just speaking of things that had done

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.040
 one of my all-time favourite cuifax,

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.880
 this is just a sentence.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.800
 In 1367, the French King, Charles V,

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.640
 prohibited the wearing of shoes shaped like penises.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:17.240
 Presumably because they were uncomfortable.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.360
 What happened was the front of the shoe would go very long.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.400
 And then they got longer and longer and longer.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.120
 And then they got more sticky-upy,

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.520
 more sticky-upy because it became more fashionable.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.640
 And then people thought,

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.400
 "Oh, something long and sticky-upy,

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.960
 why don't we make it into a penis?"

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.680
 And they did that and then they handed that out.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.320
 It's just one of my all-time favourite fads.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.720
 A lady Gaga would not have fit in in that court.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.760
 OK, time for fact number two, this one's mine.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.840
 My fact this week is that the great code breaker,

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.600
 Alan Shurring, lost his buried treasure

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.760
 when he couldn't crack his own code.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.800
 So Alan Shurring, for those, I guess,

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.520
 who don't quite know who he is.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.080
 Yeah, he is a great mathematician and code breaker

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.440
 from Blechley Park.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.920
 He was very instrumental in helping to crack things

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.120
 like the Enigma codes.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.600
 And isn't he the, he's known as the father

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.920
 of modern computing?

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.200
 Yeah, the cheering test.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.800
 The cheering test is named after him.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.400
 Yeah, so this is what happened.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.720
 This was in 1940.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.800
 Alan Shurring got really scared of a potential German invasion.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.720
 So he converted all of his life savings into two bars of silver,

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.400
 which at the time were at about 250 pounds.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.480
 He wheeled them to some woods near Shanley

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.960
 and he buried them both under the forest floor,

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.200
 one of them under the forest floor,

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.320
 one under a bridge by a bed of a stream.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.480
 He then made a code of where he buried it.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.240
 And then he made a code of the code.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.440
 And no one knows exactly how many codes are the codes

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.400
 that he made, but he made a number so that no one--

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.560
 Do we have the codes?

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.160
 No.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.600
 Because I imagine it would be X marks a spot.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.960
 X equals Y.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.040
 Oh yeah.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:01.760
 So five years later, he returns with a metal detector in hand.

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.160
 And he goes to where he buried them

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.600
 and he couldn't crack his own codes.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.280
 And he kept trying and kept trying and kept trying.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.240
 He did three expeditions to try and find his buried treasure

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.240
 in each time.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.080
 He couldn't do it.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.000
 And on top of it, in those five years,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.160
 the landscape had changed.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.320
 Someone had knocked down the bridge

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.240
 where he put it near the bed of the stream.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.440
 And so he never found it.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:26.080
 And so unless someone has found it and not told anyone about it,

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.840
 Alan Turing's silver hoard is still buried somewhere in Shanley.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.080
 But we don't know what his code was to be.

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.040
 It was probably like, yeah, look at this bridge

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:34.840
 and there's a poppy field to your left.

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.800
 And I think the man who helped crack the enigma code,

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:39.600
 probably used something a bit more complex.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:43.160
 He can't take four hops towards the last year each.

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.080
 It was a double bluff.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.040
 Three rolly polies for you.

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.440
 So simple, it's completely.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.640
 That's actually also how he cracked the enigma code

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.040
 in the first place.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.720
 So do you know who, if you find treasure in the UK,

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.040
 do you know who you report it to?

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.440
 The local coroner.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.600
 So all he does is get his dead bodies and treasure reported to him.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:05.040
 You know what you'd be hoping for, don't you?

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:08.240
 In France, you can't metal detect without a license to do so.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.000
 And much stricter on it than we are.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.360
 So I don't know whether that means there's

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.840
 much more buried treasure in France,

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.320
 just because there aren't enthusiastic amateurs

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.200
 going around the country and seeing what they can find.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.200
 Yeah, because something like 90% of treasure

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.200
 in the UK is found by people with metal detects

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.480
 is just amateurs, I think.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.200
 Do you know how many coins you have to find for it

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.720
 to qualify as like a hoard?

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.640
 You know, like he's just like a real hoarder.

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:29.080
 He's got a hoard of 100.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:29.760
 I reckon not many.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.160
 I reckon 20.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.040
 Yeah, it's two.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:32.880
 Two.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:36.720
 As long as they're at least 10% precious metal.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:37.520
 Oh, it's great.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.440
 I've got several hordes in my wallet, that's brilliant.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.120
 Well, they have to be 300 years old at least, sorry.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:42.960
 I'm very thrifty.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.080
 So.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.600
 I'm very old.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.800
 So are you allowed to keep a coin?

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.160
 But you're not allowed to keep a hoard?

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.440
 Do you then have to go to the corner?

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:51.800
 Yes.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.280
 Couldn't you just say, oh, I found a coin,

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.920
 then walk away for a bit, then walk back.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:55.880
 Oh, another coin.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.920
 Another coin.

00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:58.760
 How much?

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:00.040
 This is such a great idea.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:00.960
 I'll be excellent.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.160
 I found a coin 50 times.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.040
 They're going to have to rewrite the law right now.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.600
 There's a great story of a book that was published in 1979

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:11.080
 in England.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.640
 It was kind of the world's first global treasure hunt.

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.840
 And it was a book called The Masquerade by Kit Williams.

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:22.200
 It's only about 20 pages, and it's all illustrations.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.720
 And the story doesn't really matter.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.920
 It's the fact that in every single page,

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:29.360
 there's hidden codes to the location

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.680
 of what the boy finds at the end of the story book, which

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.520
 is this golden masquerade hair.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.360
 And Kit Williams buried it somewhere in the world.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.680
 He didn't say where.

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:38.600
 And if you cracked the code of the book,

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.000
 you would find the masquerade hair.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:40.960
 Did anyone find it?

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:44.640
 Someone eventually did, but it really made people go insane

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.120
 in the search for it, because they became obsessed with it.

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.880
 It was a really, really hard code to crack.

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:53.720
 People actually were sectioned for psychiatric help,

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:56.520
 because they were so obsessed, and they were just--

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:57.320
 Yeah, not getting to it.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:00.360
 And unfortunately, the code was cracked by a couple,

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.800
 and they wrote the letter to Kit Williams

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.040
 to say that we'd found it.

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:05.200
 And the day before that letter had arrived,

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.800
 a neighboring person came to the house and said,

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:08.880
 Kit, I've got the answer.

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.800
 I know where it is, and then dug it up.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.440
 But they were told by one of Kit Williams' friends,

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.120
 the location.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.840
 So they cheated in order to get it.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:17.360
 Oh, bust.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.160
 So he told his friends, the location.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.640
 Somehow, like he must have slipped in the pub

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:22.120
 or something.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.160
 I don't know what it was.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:23.840
 Oh, damn it.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.560
 Yeah, the person who did find it then

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:29.560
 tried to replicate the experience with a computer game,

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:32.280
 but it became so expensive to make it.

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.320
 And no one understood it once it came out.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.920
 That the company went bankrupt, and he

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.560
 had to put the mass-grade hair itself up for auction.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:39.840
 It went up for auction in Sotheby's.

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.320
 It was bought by an anonymous bidder.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:44.760
 And since it was bought 30 something odd years ago,

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.600
 no one knows its location currently.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.080
 Yeah, so it's still out there.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.120
 It's sliding.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.440
 Yeah, get the car, though.

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.200
 Yeah.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.960
 Just talking about lost things.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.560
 People always lose their pincoats on their credit cards

00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:58.040
 and whatever.

00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:59.280
 That happens all the time.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:02.480
 And I saw an article in the independent from 1996,

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:05.160
 which thought that in the future, instead of pincoats,

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.760
 people would use their fingerprints

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.760
 to say who they are when they put their credit card in.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:12.520
 People, obviously, are a little bit worried

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:13.840
 about whether that would work or not.

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:16.200
 And so they managed to stop any worry

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.200
 by saying a similar program in South Africa,

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.760
 which distributes payments to 450,000 pensioners,

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.040
 has resulted in only one attempt

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:29.080
 to use an amputated finger in more than six years.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.480
 So that sounds pretty safe.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.760
 Wow.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.960
 That's just the one they found out about presumably.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.920
 I mean, how many people with amputated fingers

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:37.640
 are there buried in someone's dungeon?

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:40.000
 When they had the line-up, they were like,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.680
 points are the guy who did this.

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.800
 [LAUGHTER]

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:47.040
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:49.280
 OK, mine's from fact number three,

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:52.440
 and we're going to do you, Anna.

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:56.080
 Yeah, my effect is that in 2011, the largest sperm bank

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:59.480
 in the world stopped accepting sperm from retets.

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.000
 They swore.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.160
 They swore at each other.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.000
 Well, it was a supply and demand issue, I think.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 It was cryos international sperm bank in Denmark.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.160
 I think Denmark calls itself the sperm capital of the world

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.720
 because there--

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:13.120
 Is that really right but the airport?

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:13.880
 Yes, it is.

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:16.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000
 They're very proud of it.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.600
 Everyone in Denmark, whenever they answer phone,

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.400
 has to say, welcome to Denmark, sperm capital of the world.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:21.920
 That's true.

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:23.800
 So was the sperm bank capital?

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.200
 Sperm bank capital, yeah, I don't think

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.200
 they just have really well-independent.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.560
 I actually use the sperm building society.

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:29.960
 I think it's more ethical.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.120
 There's a lovely fact of just the idea

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:35.360
 of having that logo on at the airport that in Scotland,

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:38.520
 they spent the tourism board spent hundreds of thousands

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:41.240
 of pounds trying to refine a great slogan

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.200
 to arrive to for all of Scotland.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.280
 And after brainstorms that lasted for however long,

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.800
 hundreds of thousands of pounds,

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.480
 they arrived at welcome to Scotland.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.800
 That's the oldies of the goodies, aren't they?

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:53.880
 Sorry, Anna, go on.

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:56.160
 Yeah, so there's a quote from Ollie Schoo.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.800
 And he says, there are too many.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:00.120
 So he runs the sperm bank in Denmark.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.320
 Cryous international sperm bank.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.120
 And he said, there are too many redheads in relation to demand.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:07.040
 I do not think you choose a redhead unless the partner,

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.760
 for example, the sterile male, has red hair,

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.560
 or because the lone woman has a preference for redheads.

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:16.600
 And that's perhaps not so many, especially in the latter case.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:17.640
 Anyway, it's obviously not fair,

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.960
 because there's absolutely nothing wrong with redheads.

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.560
 Just want to make that clear as the QI view.

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:26.800
 And he also stopped accepting Ollie Schoo,

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:30.200
 stopped accepting donations from a lot of Scandinavians as well,

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:33.840
 because they export a lot of their sperm internationally.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:35.920
 And there's not so people like to have children

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.480
 that kind of look like them.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.960
 Wow, what a weird way of making your country bigger

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:40.760
 on the global map.

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:42.760
 10% of their sperm go to Britain, in fact.

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:44.680
 And he just wraps them up in a little package,

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:46.120
 sends them, you can receive it in the post,

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:49.560
 and then you can, like, it's all DIY, order it online.

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:50.080
 Really?

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.240
 What? So it comes refrigerated?

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.880
 Or what customs just sort of wave it through?

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:54.920
 I believe so.

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:55.400
 Wow.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:56.400
 Yeah.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.480
 So it's not over the liquids amount.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.760
 A lot of it.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:00.960
 I mean, don't think so.

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.640
 I know something which is over the liquids amount.

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:04.800
 Unfortunately, this was in 2011.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.920
 There were lots of zerofishers trying to establish a sperm bank

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:09.480
 for elephants in North America, because there aren't enough

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:13.040
 elephants, and they're going to start becoming too closely

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:16.320
 related to each other in a week in the gene pool.

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:19.400
 So 16 liters of elephant semen were

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:23.200
 being kept in South African export office,

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.480
 because American import had no idea

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:26.520
 what to classify it as.

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:28.720
 There's a lot of bureaucracy in the USA.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:32.640
 So it was just kept waiting there frozen in limbo for ages.

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.400
 And I think it might still be there.

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.200
 And that was three years ago.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:40.040
 So there's 16 liters of semen waiting somewhere

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.920
 as part of Project Frozen Dumbo.

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:45.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:46.920
 Shouldn't have declared.

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:48.400
 Should have just gone through questions.

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.080
 This has gone through.

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.960
 There's over 100 miles, very tricky.

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.920
 You'd have to have a lot of tiny bottles of shampoo.

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.120
 Yeah.

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.720
 She goes in the 90% of your sperm is deformed.

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.080
 You three specifically.

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:00.480
 I told that all the time.

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.480
 [LAUGHTER]

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:03.240
 So long.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.240
 What do you mean?

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:07.920
 90% of men's sperm has either two heads or two

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:10.760
 tail, or multiple heads and tails, or a coiled tail,

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:11.800
 or a broken tail.

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.280
 So you mean superhero?

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:15.360
 Yeah, yeah, OK.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:16.280
 Superhuman.

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:19.440
 But a lot of these men actually get the clip,

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:23.240
 so they can't have babies, by a notorious villain known

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:26.080
 as Jack the Sniffer.

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:29.360
 He's killing the superheroes before they're born.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:33.120
 For me, when I hear the word redheads as an Australian,

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:36.080
 I immediately think of our matches.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:39.000
 Because in Australia, that's the leading brand of matches.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.200
 They're called redheads.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.600
 Redheads were originally made in Australia,

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:46.120
 but then they got outsourced to Sweden.

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:47.760
 And so they were no longer an Australian product.

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:49.960
 And we have a guy in Australia called Dick Smith.

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:53.640
 And he runs Dick Smith's electronics, Dick Smith's Foods.

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:56.160
 And he's kind of Australia's Richard Branson.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:00.040
 And he decided that he wasn't going to allow redheads

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:02.440
 to become the leading brand of Australian matches.

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:04.680
 So he created his own brand, which you can buy and shop.

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:05.800
 So I think you can still buy them.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:09.560
 And they're called Dickheads, his Dick Smith Dickheads.

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:13.920
 And Dickheads became a hugely popular product in Australia.

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.600
 That reminds me a little bit of, do you

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:19.560
 know about redhead day in the Netherlands?

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:20.600
 It's a summer festival.

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:23.320
 It takes place each first weekend of September

00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:24.840
 in the city of Brayda.

00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:27.120
 And all the redheads from around the world

00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:30.040
 come along and have fun and party.

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.600
 It's very popular.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.800
 But for the first few years, it wasn't so popular

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:36.920
 because it clashed with a local pumpkin contest.

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.020
 But now it's--

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:39.400
 Which orange to choose?

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:40.960
 Is that what they're doing?

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:42.440
 Why do redheads get such a hard time?

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:43.160
 I've never understood that.

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.320
 Neither of us.

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:45.360
 I always wanted to be redhead.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:46.680
 Yeah, it means you're special.

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:47.280
 Yeah.

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.520
 The Irish like redheads.

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:51.160
 There's a high demand still for redheads amongst the Irish.

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:52.640
 They're still asking for redheads.

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:54.480
 Apparently very popular in Germany as well,

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:58.760
 though as a sex researcher called Professor Dr. Werner Habermel.

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:01.440
 And he said, the sex lives of women with red hair

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.400
 is clearly more active than those with other hair color,

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.680
 with more partners and having sex more often than the average.

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:11.640
 I find it quite interesting that the human sperm cell

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:14.360
 is the smallest cell in the human body.

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.640
 And a lot of people know the egg, the female egg,

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.920
 is one of the largest, I think.

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:23.200
 But a blue whale sperm is only a very tiny amount longer

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.560
 than a human's one.

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:25.560
 Oh, it's interesting.

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:28.760
 So it's completely different by species.

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:30.240
 Yeah, it's totally random.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:31.840
 I don't know people-- I don't know why.

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.960
 They certainly don't know why the fruit fly sperm is so big.

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:36.280
 And yeah, why have a small sperm or a big sperm?

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:38.200
 Several times as long as the actual fruit fly, isn't it?

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:38.960
 20 times.

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:39.920
 20 times as long.

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:41.880
 Although I couldn't work at the work this out.

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:45.480
 So the average male ejaculate is half a teaspoon.

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:49.120
 And that's where the bang got its name from.

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:50.120
 Really?

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:50.920
 I didn't know that.

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:54.480
 brackets, I haven't also heard of the band.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.360
 It contains 200 million sperm.

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:59.120
 If you lined up all the sperm in one ejaculate,

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:01.120
 it'd stretch six miles.

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.120
 So you managed to get your sperm into one line.

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:04.320
 It's six miles up.

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:05.320
 I don't know.

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:07.560
 If you're asking them all to queue up in the blink,

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:10.040
 you need a spatula or something.

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:13.160
 You with two heads to the back.

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:16.000
 The man who first discovered the man who first saw sperm

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.560
 under a microscope who was called Van Liewenhook.

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:22.800
 So he discovered them in 1677.

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:24.360
 He was very clear whenever he wrote about it,

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:25.280
 I'll spoke about that.

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.400
 The sperm that I found were not obtained

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:29.960
 by any sinful contrivance on my part,

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:31.920
 but were the excess which nature provided me

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:33.920
 in conjugal relation.

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:37.200
 One thing I found is that it takes five people

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:39.640
 to get semen out of a vulture.

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:40.960
 Right.

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:43.240
 Is that your first hand experience?

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:44.320
 I've got that news for you.

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:47.560
 Andy, there's only four of us.

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:51.160
 What am I going to do with this guy?

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.080
 No, one person takes the limbs, one takes the head,

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:55.960
 one takes the wings, a fourth person massages it back.

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:58.280
 So after the massage, the bird gets aroused

00:19:58.280 --> 00:19:59.960
 and then it's a cloaca appears, which

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.320
 is like the sexual opening that my spurts have.

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:05.520
 And then so the fourth person then grabs the cloaca

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:09.000
 between Tham and index finger, at which point the fifth person

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.960
 collects the semen in a glass funnel.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.720
 All receptacle of their choice.

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.320
 It doesn't matter.

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:15.880
 Once you've gone to that much effort, though,

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:17.960
 you may as well get a glass funnel.

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:19.640
 And that's the stag night over.

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:27.160
 OK, final fact of the show.

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:29.680
 And we head over to Andy Murray.

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:31.280
 My fact is that the English language

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:35.360
 has more words borrowed from Hawaiian than it has from Welsh,

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.360
 which is surprising.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.280
 Yeah, because it's quite a long way away, Hawaiian.

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:41.120
 And whereas Wales is quite close.

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.440
 Almost next door.

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.280
 [LAUGHTER]

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:45.280
 So let me think.

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:49.800
 So maybe that is because things in Hawaii are more unusual

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:52.040
 to us, things that are in Wales, we just

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:53.440
 use the English words for our past.

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:56.480
 Well, possibly, but there seems to be a theory

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:59.720
 that it's actually snobbery, that it was Anglo-Saxon snobbery

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.440
 that repressed the Welsh language.

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:04.800
 And it was suppressed for a long time in the 19th century.

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.720
 So this is acclaimed by Dr. Philip Durkin,

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.560
 who's the author of borrowed words.

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.840
 And he's also the deputy editor of the OED.

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:12.680
 So he knows his stuff.

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:14.280
 And he's ranked a lot of different languages in terms

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:17.720
 of how many words from them have ended up in the OED.

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:20.840
 And Latin comes first and French comes second.

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:26.040
 But Hawaiian manages to beat Welsh, as does Turkish and Icelandic.

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:27.480
 Hawaiian words that we have include things

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:30.680
 like a hula hoop from Hula, the hula does,

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:33.960
 ukulele, aloha, and wiki, which means quickly.

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.240
 So wikipedia.

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.800
 So if you go to Hawaii, I've been to Hawaii,

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:40.680
 and if you get a bus from the airport to wherever you need to go,

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:43.600
 they're called wiki, wiki buses, because they're quinks, right?

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.800
 There's a bunch of words that I think someone

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.520
 recently wrote a book on was that the English language

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:48.720
 used to have that we should bring back,

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:52.000
 but the only one that springs to mind is fizzle,

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.120
 which used to mean in the 15th and 16th centuries,

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:59.000
 it was a verb, it meant to break wind without making a noise.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.400
 Which you don't have anymore, but apparently, yeah.

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.280
 Fizzle is where we get the word feisty from.

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:07.760
 Andy, you actually have invented new words, haven't you,

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.640
 for you were one of the kind of silent authors

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:13.720
 of the new meaning of the lift book after this.

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:15.080
 It was a book there, what was it, Andy?

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:15.760
 It's a book there.

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:17.720
 It's a book of things that there should be words for,

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:18.520
 but aren't.

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:21.720
 So the original one was in the 80s, and it was one of the words,

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:24.000
 and that was Abilene, which is the pleasant coolness

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.640
 on the other side of a pillow, which is lovely.

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:27.560
 There's no word for that on a hot night when you turn

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.240
 your pillow over, oh, it's so nice.

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:32.640
 So all the words in it, all the definitions

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:34.680
 of real place names from around the world,

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:36.240
 matched with things that--

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:38.280
 Experiences that don't yet have a word to condense them.

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:39.080
 Exactly, yes.

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:42.120
 So Angram, an amusing anagram you've come up with,

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:45.280
 which doesn't quite work, for example.

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:47.800
 Or Dambi Whisk, which is the bit of kitchen equipment,

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:50.040
 that you don't know what it's for, but it always

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:52.240
 means that you can't quite shut the drawer properly.

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:53.880
 And you have to sort of charm it in.

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:56.640
 So that kind of stuff, that's great.

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:59.960
 Going to the Welsh thing, there are several thousand people

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:03.120
 in Patagonia in Argentina who descended from the Welsh

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:05.880
 and speak Welsh and Spanish as their two main languages.

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:08.040
 There are nearly as many Welsh speakers there

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:09.120
 as their own Wales.

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.240
 That's bizarre.

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:10.440
 Yeah.

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:13.480
 I really love it when language gets kind of preserved,

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.440
 because you're in an isolated place.

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:16.960
 I remember going to North Carolina

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.680
 and being right on the coastline.

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:20.320
 And obviously, that's where some of the first people

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.720
 landed from a South-West coast.

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:25.840
 And everyone there spoke with kind of a really thick Devonshire

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:26.200
 accent.

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:27.200
 It's so weird.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.200
 So you're in North Carolina.

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:30.320
 And people are talking like this to you.

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:32.120
 I'm not very good at that accent.

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:34.880
 I'll be proud to present Palmerston Island, I think,

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.720
 in the middle of the Pacific.

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.640
 And they all speak with a Gloucestershire accent.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:39.440
 Yeah, that's so clear.

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:40.320
 This is not a real island.

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:41.160
 Oh, really?

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:43.200
 My favourite word is Grockel, which is a Devon word,

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.960
 which means somebody's not from around here.

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:45.800
 Yeah, that's good.

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:46.800
 Very definitely.

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:47.400
 I'm not from Grockel.

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:49.200
 The Hawaiians have a word for that, actually.

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:52.160
 How, how, how, how, how, how, something like that,

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:54.240
 which means someone who's not from around there.

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:54.920
 Oh, yeah.

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:55.720
 Yeah, yeah.

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:57.720
 There are some other Hawaiian words,

00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.760
 which we should probably borrow in a bit,

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:01.800
 similar to what we do with Afterlif.

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:03.240
 These are quite cool words.

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:06.840
 Makahaka-haka is someone with deep-set eyeballs.

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:07.720
 Which is very good.

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:08.520
 Oh, that's me.

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:09.320
 I've got deep-set eyes.

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:09.840
 Is it?

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:10.680
 Oh, yeah.

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:13.320
 If you're listening at home, we can barely see Danzai's,

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:14.880
 because they're just so far away.

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:17.560
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:18.200
 There's another one.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:21.760
 It's Ulaia, which means to live like a hermit

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.240
 because of disappointment.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.080
 Wow.

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:25.520
 Oh, my god, that's amazing.

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:26.560
 It's very specific as well.

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:28.160
 The fact that you need a word for that implies

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.640
 that there are a lot of people living as hermits

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:31.160
 because of disappointment.

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.160
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:34.920
 They should meet up and not be hermits anymore.

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:35.720
 That is just--

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:37.520
 This is completely off-topic.

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:39.240
 But do you know that thing about the hermits

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:41.040
 in like the first of the fourth century?

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:43.920
 It was a fashion for people who were religious

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:46.200
 to go and live in the desert as a hermit.

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:48.800
 A few people did it, and then it became more fashionable,

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:50.920
 and more fashionable, and more fashionable still.

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.160
 And then you have all these writings of these hermits

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:54.920
 living in the desert going, I can't move

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:56.240
 for all these other hermits.

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.560
 It's just totally hermit.

00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:59.360
 I read the other day that one of the things

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.960
 that people used to do to sort out their melancholy--

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:04.000
 this was the rich back in the days--

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.480
 that they would hire a hermit to live on their grounds,

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:07.760
 and they would build a hermitage.

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:09.360
 And they would go and talk to that hermit,

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:11.360
 and then they would let the problem sit with the hermit,

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:14.160
 and the hermit would then just mull on them on their behalf.

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:16.400
 But sometimes, if you couldn't afford the hermit,

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:18.840
 they would often just build the hermitage.

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:22.200
 They would leave items in particular positions.

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:23.880
 So they looked like the hermit was just--

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:24.960
 he'd just gone out for a walk.

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.400
 He was showing off to your rich friends.

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:27.240
 Oh, I've got a hermit.

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:29.440
 Oh, he must be out of the moment.

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:31.080
 He's out socialising.

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:32.240
 He's gone out on the town.

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:34.200
 You don't really need to do that, because all you have to do

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:35.120
 is say, oh, he's a hermit.

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:36.360
 He doesn't like to be disfigured.

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.520
 I don't think that's true.

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:39.800
 I can't believe there was a theory

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.320
 that it might make you less melancholy

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:44.800
 to go and rearrange the furniture in your fake hermitage house.

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:46.920
 It sounds like I would walk out of that house

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:49.680
 and commit suicide immediately.

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:52.240
 What's my life at a girl?

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:54.720
 Somebody from the University of Leicester School

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.360
 in English who was researching the hermit thing

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:59.240
 said that they would leave reading matter and glasses out,

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:02.360
 a bit like leaving Cheryale for Father Christmas.

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:03.280
 So--

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:04.920
 Yeah, so to look like he was there.

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:05.440
 And yeah.

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:06.720
 I think that's quite charming.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:07.240
 Yeah, yeah.

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:09.040
 And then they'd pretend to turn the pages

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.880
 and put a bit more on kind of new page.

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:11.880
 We're more on kind of it every day.

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:12.640
 Yeah.

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:16.240
 Oh, he's really got a long way with Little Dorit.

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:19.200
 Words that we do get just going back to Welsh,

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:20.920
 because we've gone so far off topic.

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:22.480
 But words that we do get from Welsh

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:26.920
 include flannel, flummery, corgi, and dad.

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:27.480
 Dad.

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.480
 Yeah.

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:29.800
 That was a pretty big hit, sir.

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:30.840
 But not mom.

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:31.960
 No, not mom.

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:36.760
 Isn't Ma the universal word from mother as a result of all babies?

00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:38.000
 It's pretty youthful.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.080
 But there is a place.

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:41.080
 And I think it's Georgia or Armenia,

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:43.840
 where the word for mother is dada.

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:44.360
 Yeah.

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:46.160
 It's one of very few places in the world.

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:47.520
 The corgi thing's quite interesting,

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:51.720
 because it means that the correct plural of corgi

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:55.200
 is cauguin, because that's the way the Welsh plural is made.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.000
 You have another thing about plurals.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.960
 The one is whenever I go to a sandwich shop,

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:05.880
 I get very annoyed if I ask Panini, and they only give me one.

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:08.040
 Because Panini is plural, and it should be--

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:10.560
 and I always ask for a Panino if I only want one of them.

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:12.480
 You're going to be perpetually disappointed.

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.680
 That is such a lovely god.

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:17.680
 And I never invite a QIL 30 kind of shop,

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:20.160
 because you're just going to be bantic at the hour and every day.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.440
 Actually, there's no such thing as a fish.

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:22.760
 Get out of my fish and chip shop.

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:25.560
 You're one of the QILs, aren't you?

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:27.960
 Do you know what the state fish of Hawaii is?

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:30.240
 No, I'm going to tell you.

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:35.400
 It's the Humu, Humu, Nuku, Nuku, A-Pu, A-A.

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:37.840
 This is why we took from Hawaiian, rather than from Welsh,

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:39.360
 because they've lost so many vowels, and vowels

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.280
 are really easy to pronounce, aren't they?

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:45.280
 Hawaiian word, Humu, A-E-O-I-A, meaning certified,

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:47.720
 has the most consecutive vowels of any word

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:49.040
 in the current human speech.

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:52.200
 Just kind of sounds like they're drunk all the time, isn't it?

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.000
 If you're just alighting too many vowels--

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.760
 Sounds better than they're cornish.

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:57.120
 Yeah.

00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:59.720
 I'll see you later.

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:00.680
 OK, we should wrap up.

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:01.920
 Just one final thing, Anna.

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.680
 One final thing, phonetomology.

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:06.360
 The first known use of the word abracadabra

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:09.120
 was from the third century, seems kind of weird to me,

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:11.120
 because he would have thought it was like a modern--

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:13.280
 I don't know, it sounds like such a weird modern concoction,

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:15.000
 but it was used in the third century by a doctor

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 who prescribed it as an anti-malarial.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.560
 It was one of the first proposed cures for malaria, and you--

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:21.080
 Just to say abracadabra?

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:23.640
 Yeah, you actually have to wear it around your neck

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:24.520
 and an amulet, too.

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:26.480
 But I like the idea of someone going to the doctor.

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.240
 He's like, I'm feeling not very good.

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.320
 I think I'm a malaria.

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:31.000
 Oh, I've got the one thing for you.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.040
 Abracadabra!

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:33.040
 Abracadabra!

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:34.640
 Yeah.

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:35.960
 Thanks, I feel much better.

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:42.200
 OK, that's it for our episode.

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:43.120
 That's all our facts.

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:44.800
 Thanks for listening to our show.

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:46.480
 If you want to get in touch with any of us

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:47.960
 about any of the things that we've said,

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:49.960
 you can reach us on our Twitter handles.

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:52.400
 James can be found on @xshaped.

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.560
 Andy, you're on @andruhontoem.

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:56.200
 I'm on @shriverland.

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:58.480
 Anna is not on Twitter at the moment.

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:01.480
 Again, she is still refraining from joining,

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.160
 but we will get her one day.

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:07.720
 In the meantime, she sets up our fantastic qi.com/podcast page

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:09.920
 where we're going to have links and videos and photos
