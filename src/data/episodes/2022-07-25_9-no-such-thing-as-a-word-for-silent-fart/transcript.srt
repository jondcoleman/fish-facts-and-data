1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
 We run it on QI a few years ago.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,160
 Yeah.

3
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,360
 And which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

4
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,640
 It's kind of the nicer thing as a fish.

5
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,040
 No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

6
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,520
 It says it right there, first paragraph, no such thing as a fish.

7
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:26,200
 Hello, and welcome to another edition of "No Such Thing As A Fish"

8
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,960
 a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,120
 in Culverant Garden.

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,520
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

11
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,800
 I'm sitting here with three other QI elves, James,

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,400
 Markin, Hanuch, Zinsky, and Andy Murray.

13
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,680
 And once again, we've gathered around the microphones

14
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,280
 to share our favorite facts from the last seven days.

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,720
 So, in no particular order, here we go.

16
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:48,840
 James, let's begin with you.

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,160
 OK, yeah, my fat this week is it was fashionable in New York

18
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,840
 at the end of the 19th century for ladies

19
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,960
 to wear live lizards as broaches.

20
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,800
 Wow.

21
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,000
 With a pin on them?

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,280
 Well, actually, with a small leash, it seems.

23
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,600
 This was an article in the archive of The New York Times

24
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,080
 about the RSPCA complaining about it.

25
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:09,760
 I'm surprising.

26
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,680
 Yeah, I mean, let me give you a few little bits.

27
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,920
 The lizards have been sold as chameleons.

28
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,120
 They were fastened to cushions by means of tiny colors and chains,

29
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,080
 and they have become quite a plaything with many people.

30
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,680
 Sometimes they were worn in the streets by women

31
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,480
 who had them attached to their bodices.

32
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,560
 It doesn't really give any more information than that.

33
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,440
 And was this popular?

34
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,920
 Was it, did a lot of people do it?

35
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,000
 I imagine it didn't last for very long because the RSPCA

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,600
 in the New York Times got involved.

37
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,800
 Are there any other animals that we've known to have worn?

38
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,600
 Yes, which really recently, maybe used all this as well.

39
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,240
 And I don't really know why I don't remember this.

40
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,840
 Apparently, in 2006, there was a fashion designer

41
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,480
 who designed cockroach broaches.

42
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,960
 I think mainly because of the rhyming thing.

43
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,800
 But they became quite a popular thing.

44
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,680
 And there was a live cockroach on a brooch.

45
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,080
 And so they were decorated with like,

46
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,840
 ornate jewelry and painted gold and stuff.

47
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,080
 And apparently they could last up to a year.

48
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,240
 And they just crawled around using it.

49
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,520
 I think Paris Hilton got one.

50
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,400
 Women used to keep the small pets in their moths.

51
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,560
 They would decorate their moths with jewels

52
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,760
 and they would put pets in there.

53
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,080
 And for a while, it was like a status symbol.

54
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,360
 The larger your moth was, the more rich you were.

55
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,360
 So if you get a horse in there, a 16-hander,

56
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,640
 then that's impressive.

57
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,680
 People are going, she must be a princess or something.

58
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,880
 She has a moth that fits a horse in.

59
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,720
 People would be impressed, yes?

60
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,800
 There was another live animal that people used, apparently,

61
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,520
 in the Middle Ages.

62
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,640
 One recommended cure for the plague

63
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:38,920
 was strapping a live chicken around the bubos on your body.

64
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,440
 Oh, yeah.

65
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,120
 That work?

66
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,920
 No, no, that's why a third of Europe died.

67
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,080
 I find that amazing.

68
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,120
 They used to think that if you got bitten by a snake,

69
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,320
 that if you put a live pigeon on the bite,

70
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,240
 the bottom of a pigeon, it would suck out the venom.

71
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,080
 That's right.

72
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,320
 Yeah, and you would consistently use more and more pigeons

73
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:03,200
 until the final anus sucking pigeon didn't die.

74
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,560
 And then you knew you got all the poison out.

75
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,800
 I have a very dim memory of people in China, a thousand,

76
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,160
 or so years ago, keeping something, a little insect

77
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:15,360
 in a cage around their necks, which had drunk their lovers blood.

78
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,640
 Yeah, that would happen in Europe with fleas.

79
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,480
 Fleas, that's it.

80
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,640
 But I can't imagine a cage smaller enough to keep a flea

81
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,880
 and stop it from escaping.

82
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,560
 There's a poem by John Dunn called "The Flea",

83
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,280
 which is talking about how the fleas bitten her.

84
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,440
 Now it's bitten him and he's saying,

85
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,840
 oh, in the romantic, it's got both of us mingled in it.

86
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,560
 Oh, that's a good poem.

87
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,560
 They all died of the plague soon after that.

88
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,800
 Which isn't caused by rats, again, right?

89
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,000
 I know this always comes around.

90
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,040
 Well, just on that subject of rats and us wearing lizards,

91
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,840
 there's a nice little mouse that we've been giving back to,

92
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,760
 which is a mouse that's going kind of,

93
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,960
 it's gone the endangered list.

94
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,400
 And all the used balls from Wimbledon

95
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,360
 have been donated as little houses for these mice.

96
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,200
 That's very nice.

97
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,040
 Yeah.

98
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,320
 Eurasian harvest mice.

99
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,000
 That's right.

100
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,440
 Yeah, so we should put a picture of on the website

101
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,760
 of them and these little homes.

102
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,200
 I thought you were going to say the reverse of the lizard thing

103
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,520
 is there's an animal that's been wearing a human in some way.

104
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,880
 Is that what horses claim they're doing?

105
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,600
 That's not my credit cesarean again.

106
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,200
 Yeah, the fashion for humans in tight trousers

107
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,560
 and long boots remains.

108
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,600
 I do really like the origin of fashions

109
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,000
 that are quite normal, though.

110
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,960
 I didn't know how people used to wear wigs

111
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,240
 from the 17th century into the 19th century.

112
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,800
 That was because Louis, the 13th,

113
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,320
 had male patterned baldness.

114
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,680
 And so he insisted on wearing wigs all the time to conceal that.

115
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,400
 They used to wear really massive wigs,

116
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,880
 and they're really ridiculous with things

117
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,840
 in the wigs like a ship in a full sail

118
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,960
 or a windmill with farm animals around it.

119
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,040
 And this massive wig, yeah.

120
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,560
 Sometimes they would, if there was something

121
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,160
 would happen in the news, they would wear a wig

122
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,800
 which reflected what was happening in the news at the time.

123
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,320
 No.

124
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,280
 And else, they were quite expensive these wigs.

125
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,280
 If you got a really good one, they were really status symbols.

126
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,360
 And wig theft became a bit of a problem.

127
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,960
 What they would have is you would walk across, if you were a thief,

128
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,400
 you'd walk across with a basket,

129
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,840
 and there'd be a young child inside the basket.

130
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,520
 And then you would distract him for some reason.

131
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,680
 Then the child would pop out, grab the wig,

132
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,080
 pop back in into the basket and you'd run off.

133
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,920
 Oh, how many of those all good moments were there

134
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,080
 from cartoons where the children grabbed someone's hair

135
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,840
 and it turned out not to be a wig.

136
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,760
 And then...

137
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,640
 And people going, "That's definitely my mate,

138
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,640
 "Hindenburg Crash, that you're wearing on your head."

139
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,920
 What were on wig theft?

140
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,720
 Someone, a lot of people in the 1910s and 1920s,

141
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,000
 there were bands on people bobbing their hair,

142
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 whether that was locally enforced.

143
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,400
 There weren't any governmental bands on it,

144
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,720
 but it was very discouraged.

145
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,480
 It was seen as being far too racy.

146
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,600
 And at least one girl blamed her haircut

147
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,800
 on what they called Jack the Clipper.

148
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,760
 As in someone just leaned out and shot my hair.

149
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,560
 So a girl in the Bronx said that a high-witman

150
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,960
 had grabbed her and cut her hair off.

151
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,800
 That sounds like someone where they

152
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,880
 thought of the name of the criminal before.

153
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,960
 Just speaking of things that had done

154
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,040
 one of my all-time favourite cuifax,

155
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,880
 this is just a sentence.

156
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,800
 In 1367, the French King, Charles V,

157
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,640
 prohibited the wearing of shoes shaped like penises.

158
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:17,240
 Presumably because they were uncomfortable.

159
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,360
 What happened was the front of the shoe would go very long.

160
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,400
 And then they got longer and longer and longer.

161
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,120
 And then they got more sticky-upy,

162
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,520
 more sticky-upy because it became more fashionable.

163
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,640
 And then people thought,

164
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,400
 "Oh, something long and sticky-upy,

165
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,960
 why don't we make it into a penis?"

166
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,680
 And they did that and then they handed that out.

167
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,320
 It's just one of my all-time favourite fads.

168
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,720
 A lady Gaga would not have fit in in that court.

169
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,760
 OK, time for fact number two, this one's mine.

170
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,840
 My fact this week is that the great code breaker,

171
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,600
 Alan Shurring, lost his buried treasure

172
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,760
 when he couldn't crack his own code.

173
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,800
 So Alan Shurring, for those, I guess,

174
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,520
 who don't quite know who he is.

175
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,080
 Yeah, he is a great mathematician and code breaker

176
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,440
 from Blechley Park.

177
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,920
 He was very instrumental in helping to crack things

178
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,120
 like the Enigma codes.

179
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,600
 And isn't he the, he's known as the father

180
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,920
 of modern computing?

181
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,200
 Yeah, the cheering test.

182
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,800
 The cheering test is named after him.

183
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,400
 Yeah, so this is what happened.

184
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,720
 This was in 1940.

185
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,800
 Alan Shurring got really scared of a potential German invasion.

186
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,720
 So he converted all of his life savings into two bars of silver,

187
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,400
 which at the time were at about 250 pounds.

188
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,480
 He wheeled them to some woods near Shanley

189
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,960
 and he buried them both under the forest floor,

190
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,200
 one of them under the forest floor,

191
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,320
 one under a bridge by a bed of a stream.

192
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,480
 He then made a code of where he buried it.

193
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,240
 And then he made a code of the code.

194
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,440
 And no one knows exactly how many codes are the codes

195
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,400
 that he made, but he made a number so that no one--

196
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,560
 Do we have the codes?

197
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,160
 No.

198
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,600
 Because I imagine it would be X marks a spot.

199
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,960
 X equals Y.

200
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,040
 Oh yeah.

201
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,760
 So five years later, he returns with a metal detector in hand.

202
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,160
 And he goes to where he buried them

203
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,600
 and he couldn't crack his own codes.

204
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,280
 And he kept trying and kept trying and kept trying.

205
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,240
 He did three expeditions to try and find his buried treasure

206
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,240
 in each time.

207
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,080
 He couldn't do it.

208
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,000
 And on top of it, in those five years,

209
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,160
 the landscape had changed.

210
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,320
 Someone had knocked down the bridge

211
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,240
 where he put it near the bed of the stream.

212
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,440
 And so he never found it.

213
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,080
 And so unless someone has found it and not told anyone about it,

214
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,840
 Alan Turing's silver hoard is still buried somewhere in Shanley.

215
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,080
 But we don't know what his code was to be.

216
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,040
 It was probably like, yeah, look at this bridge

217
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,840
 and there's a poppy field to your left.

218
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,800
 And I think the man who helped crack the enigma code,

219
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,600
 probably used something a bit more complex.

220
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,160
 He can't take four hops towards the last year each.

221
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,080
 It was a double bluff.

222
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,040
 Three rolly polies for you.

223
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,440
 So simple, it's completely.

224
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,640
 That's actually also how he cracked the enigma code

225
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,040
 in the first place.

226
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,720
 So do you know who, if you find treasure in the UK,

227
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,040
 do you know who you report it to?

228
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,440
 The local coroner.

229
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,600
 So all he does is get his dead bodies and treasure reported to him.

230
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,040
 You know what you'd be hoping for, don't you?

231
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,240
 In France, you can't metal detect without a license to do so.

232
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,000
 And much stricter on it than we are.

233
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,360
 So I don't know whether that means there's

234
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,840
 much more buried treasure in France,

235
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,320
 just because there aren't enthusiastic amateurs

236
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,200
 going around the country and seeing what they can find.

237
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,200
 Yeah, because something like 90% of treasure

238
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,200
 in the UK is found by people with metal detects

239
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,480
 is just amateurs, I think.

240
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,200
 Do you know how many coins you have to find for it

241
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,720
 to qualify as like a hoard?

242
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,640
 You know, like he's just like a real hoarder.

243
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,080
 He's got a hoard of 100.

244
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,760
 I reckon not many.

245
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,160
 I reckon 20.

246
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,040
 Yeah, it's two.

247
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,880
 Two.

248
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,720
 As long as they're at least 10% precious metal.

249
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,520
 Oh, it's great.

250
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,440
 I've got several hordes in my wallet, that's brilliant.

251
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,120
 Well, they have to be 300 years old at least, sorry.

252
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:42,960
 I'm very thrifty.

253
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,080
 So.

254
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,600
 I'm very old.

255
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,800
 So are you allowed to keep a coin?

256
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,160
 But you're not allowed to keep a hoard?

257
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,440
 Do you then have to go to the corner?

258
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:51,800
 Yes.

259
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,280
 Couldn't you just say, oh, I found a coin,

260
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,920
 then walk away for a bit, then walk back.

261
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,880
 Oh, another coin.

262
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,920
 Another coin.

263
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,760
 How much?

264
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,040
 This is such a great idea.

265
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,960
 I'll be excellent.

266
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,160
 I found a coin 50 times.

267
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,040
 They're going to have to rewrite the law right now.

268
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,600
 There's a great story of a book that was published in 1979

269
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,080
 in England.

270
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,640
 It was kind of the world's first global treasure hunt.

271
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,840
 And it was a book called The Masquerade by Kit Williams.

272
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,200
 It's only about 20 pages, and it's all illustrations.

273
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,720
 And the story doesn't really matter.

274
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,920
 It's the fact that in every single page,

275
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,360
 there's hidden codes to the location

276
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,680
 of what the boy finds at the end of the story book, which

277
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,520
 is this golden masquerade hair.

278
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,360
 And Kit Williams buried it somewhere in the world.

279
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,680
 He didn't say where.

280
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,600
 And if you cracked the code of the book,

281
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,000
 you would find the masquerade hair.

282
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,960
 Did anyone find it?

283
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,640
 Someone eventually did, but it really made people go insane

284
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,120
 in the search for it, because they became obsessed with it.

285
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,880
 It was a really, really hard code to crack.

286
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,720
 People actually were sectioned for psychiatric help,

287
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,520
 because they were so obsessed, and they were just--

288
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,320
 Yeah, not getting to it.

289
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,360
 And unfortunately, the code was cracked by a couple,

290
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,800
 and they wrote the letter to Kit Williams

291
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,040
 to say that we'd found it.

292
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,200
 And the day before that letter had arrived,

293
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,800
 a neighboring person came to the house and said,

294
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,880
 Kit, I've got the answer.

295
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,800
 I know where it is, and then dug it up.

296
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,440
 But they were told by one of Kit Williams' friends,

297
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,120
 the location.

298
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,840
 So they cheated in order to get it.

299
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,360
 Oh, bust.

300
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,160
 So he told his friends, the location.

301
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,640
 Somehow, like he must have slipped in the pub

302
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,120
 or something.

303
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,160
 I don't know what it was.

304
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:23,840
 Oh, damn it.

305
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,560
 Yeah, the person who did find it then

306
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,560
 tried to replicate the experience with a computer game,

307
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,280
 but it became so expensive to make it.

308
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,320
 And no one understood it once it came out.

309
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,920
 That the company went bankrupt, and he

310
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,560
 had to put the mass-grade hair itself up for auction.

311
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,840
 It went up for auction in Sotheby's.

312
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,320
 It was bought by an anonymous bidder.

313
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,760
 And since it was bought 30 something odd years ago,

314
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,600
 no one knows its location currently.

315
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,080
 Yeah, so it's still out there.

316
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,120
 It's sliding.

317
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,440
 Yeah, get the car, though.

318
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,200
 Yeah.

319
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,960
 Just talking about lost things.

320
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,560
 People always lose their pincoats on their credit cards

321
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,040
 and whatever.

322
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,280
 That happens all the time.

323
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,480
 And I saw an article in the independent from 1996,

324
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,160
 which thought that in the future, instead of pincoats,

325
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,760
 people would use their fingerprints

326
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,760
 to say who they are when they put their credit card in.

327
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,520
 People, obviously, are a little bit worried

328
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,840
 about whether that would work or not.

329
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,200
 And so they managed to stop any worry

330
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,200
 by saying a similar program in South Africa,

331
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,760
 which distributes payments to 450,000 pensioners,

332
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,040
 has resulted in only one attempt

333
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,080
 to use an amputated finger in more than six years.

334
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,480
 So that sounds pretty safe.

335
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,760
 Wow.

336
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,960
 That's just the one they found out about presumably.

337
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,920
 I mean, how many people with amputated fingers

338
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,640
 are there buried in someone's dungeon?

339
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,000
 When they had the line-up, they were like,

340
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,680
 points are the guy who did this.

341
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,800
 [LAUGHTER]

342
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,040
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

343
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,280
 OK, mine's from fact number three,

344
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,440
 and we're going to do you, Anna.

345
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,080
 Yeah, my effect is that in 2011, the largest sperm bank

346
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,480
 in the world stopped accepting sperm from retets.

347
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,000
 They swore.

348
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,160
 They swore at each other.

349
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,000
 Well, it was a supply and demand issue, I think.

350
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 It was cryos international sperm bank in Denmark.

351
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,160
 I think Denmark calls itself the sperm capital of the world

352
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,720
 because there--

353
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,120
 Is that really right but the airport?

354
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,880
 Yes, it is.

355
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,000
 [LAUGHTER]

356
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 They're very proud of it.

357
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,600
 Everyone in Denmark, whenever they answer phone,

358
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,400
 has to say, welcome to Denmark, sperm capital of the world.

359
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:21,920
 That's true.

360
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,800
 So was the sperm bank capital?

361
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,200
 Sperm bank capital, yeah, I don't think

362
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,200
 they just have really well-independent.

363
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,560
 I actually use the sperm building society.

364
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,960
 I think it's more ethical.

365
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,120
 There's a lovely fact of just the idea

366
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,360
 of having that logo on at the airport that in Scotland,

367
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,520
 they spent the tourism board spent hundreds of thousands

368
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,240
 of pounds trying to refine a great slogan

369
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,200
 to arrive to for all of Scotland.

370
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,280
 And after brainstorms that lasted for however long,

371
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,800
 hundreds of thousands of pounds,

372
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,480
 they arrived at welcome to Scotland.

373
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,800
 That's the oldies of the goodies, aren't they?

374
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,880
 Sorry, Anna, go on.

375
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,160
 Yeah, so there's a quote from Ollie Schoo.

376
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,800
 And he says, there are too many.

377
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,120
 So he runs the sperm bank in Denmark.

378
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,320
 Cryous international sperm bank.

379
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,120
 And he said, there are too many redheads in relation to demand.

380
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,040
 I do not think you choose a redhead unless the partner,

381
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,760
 for example, the sterile male, has red hair,

382
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,560
 or because the lone woman has a preference for redheads.

383
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,600
 And that's perhaps not so many, especially in the latter case.

384
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,640
 Anyway, it's obviously not fair,

385
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,960
 because there's absolutely nothing wrong with redheads.

386
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,560
 Just want to make that clear as the QI view.

387
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,800
 And he also stopped accepting Ollie Schoo,

388
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,200
 stopped accepting donations from a lot of Scandinavians as well,

389
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,840
 because they export a lot of their sperm internationally.

390
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,920
 And there's not so people like to have children

391
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,480
 that kind of look like them.

392
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,960
 Wow, what a weird way of making your country bigger

393
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,760
 on the global map.

394
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,760
 10% of their sperm go to Britain, in fact.

395
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,680
 And he just wraps them up in a little package,

396
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,120
 sends them, you can receive it in the post,

397
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,560
 and then you can, like, it's all DIY, order it online.

398
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,080
 Really?

399
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,240
 What? So it comes refrigerated?

400
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,880
 Or what customs just sort of wave it through?

401
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,920
 I believe so.

402
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,400
 Wow.

403
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,400
 Yeah.

404
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,480
 So it's not over the liquids amount.

405
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,760
 A lot of it.

406
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,960
 I mean, don't think so.

407
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,640
 I know something which is over the liquids amount.

408
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,800
 Unfortunately, this was in 2011.

409
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,920
 There were lots of zerofishers trying to establish a sperm bank

410
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,480
 for elephants in North America, because there aren't enough

411
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,040
 elephants, and they're going to start becoming too closely

412
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,320
 related to each other in a week in the gene pool.

413
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,400
 So 16 liters of elephant semen were

414
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,200
 being kept in South African export office,

415
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,480
 because American import had no idea

416
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,520
 what to classify it as.

417
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,720
 There's a lot of bureaucracy in the USA.

418
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,640
 So it was just kept waiting there frozen in limbo for ages.

419
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,400
 And I think it might still be there.

420
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,200
 And that was three years ago.

421
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,040
 So there's 16 liters of semen waiting somewhere

422
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,920
 as part of Project Frozen Dumbo.

423
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,840
 [LAUGHTER]

424
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,920
 Shouldn't have declared.

425
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,400
 Should have just gone through questions.

426
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,080
 This has gone through.

427
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,960
 There's over 100 miles, very tricky.

428
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,920
 You'd have to have a lot of tiny bottles of shampoo.

429
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,120
 Yeah.

430
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,720
 She goes in the 90% of your sperm is deformed.

431
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,080
 You three specifically.

432
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,480
 I told that all the time.

433
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,480
 [LAUGHTER]

434
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,240
 So long.

435
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,240
 What do you mean?

436
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,920
 90% of men's sperm has either two heads or two

437
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,760
 tail, or multiple heads and tails, or a coiled tail,

438
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,800
 or a broken tail.

439
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,280
 So you mean superhero?

440
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,360
 Yeah, yeah, OK.

441
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,280
 Superhuman.

442
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,440
 But a lot of these men actually get the clip,

443
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,240
 so they can't have babies, by a notorious villain known

444
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,080
 as Jack the Sniffer.

445
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,360
 He's killing the superheroes before they're born.

446
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,120
 For me, when I hear the word redheads as an Australian,

447
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,080
 I immediately think of our matches.

448
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,000
 Because in Australia, that's the leading brand of matches.

449
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,200
 They're called redheads.

450
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,600
 Redheads were originally made in Australia,

451
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,120
 but then they got outsourced to Sweden.

452
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,760
 And so they were no longer an Australian product.

453
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,960
 And we have a guy in Australia called Dick Smith.

454
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:53,640
 And he runs Dick Smith's electronics, Dick Smith's Foods.

455
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,160
 And he's kind of Australia's Richard Branson.

456
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,040
 And he decided that he wasn't going to allow redheads

457
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,440
 to become the leading brand of Australian matches.

458
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,680
 So he created his own brand, which you can buy and shop.

459
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,800
 So I think you can still buy them.

460
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,560
 And they're called Dickheads, his Dick Smith Dickheads.

461
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:13,920
 And Dickheads became a hugely popular product in Australia.

462
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,600
 That reminds me a little bit of, do you

463
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,560
 know about redhead day in the Netherlands?

464
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,600
 It's a summer festival.

465
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,320
 It takes place each first weekend of September

466
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,840
 in the city of Brayda.

467
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,120
 And all the redheads from around the world

468
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,040
 come along and have fun and party.

469
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,600
 It's very popular.

470
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,800
 But for the first few years, it wasn't so popular

471
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,920
 because it clashed with a local pumpkin contest.

472
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,020
 But now it's--

473
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,400
 Which orange to choose?

474
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,960
 Is that what they're doing?

475
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,440
 Why do redheads get such a hard time?

476
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,160
 I've never understood that.

477
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,320
 Neither of us.

478
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,360
 I always wanted to be redhead.

479
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,680
 Yeah, it means you're special.

480
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,280
 Yeah.

481
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,520
 The Irish like redheads.

482
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,160
 There's a high demand still for redheads amongst the Irish.

483
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,640
 They're still asking for redheads.

484
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,480
 Apparently very popular in Germany as well,

485
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,760
 though as a sex researcher called Professor Dr. Werner Habermel.

486
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,440
 And he said, the sex lives of women with red hair

487
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,400
 is clearly more active than those with other hair color,

488
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,680
 with more partners and having sex more often than the average.

489
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:11,640
 I find it quite interesting that the human sperm cell

490
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,360
 is the smallest cell in the human body.

491
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,640
 And a lot of people know the egg, the female egg,

492
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,920
 is one of the largest, I think.

493
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:23,200
 But a blue whale sperm is only a very tiny amount longer

494
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,560
 than a human's one.

495
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,560
 Oh, it's interesting.

496
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,760
 So it's completely different by species.

497
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,240
 Yeah, it's totally random.

498
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,840
 I don't know people-- I don't know why.

499
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,960
 They certainly don't know why the fruit fly sperm is so big.

500
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,280
 And yeah, why have a small sperm or a big sperm?

501
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,200
 Several times as long as the actual fruit fly, isn't it?

502
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:38,960
 20 times.

503
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,920
 20 times as long.

504
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,880
 Although I couldn't work at the work this out.

505
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,480
 So the average male ejaculate is half a teaspoon.

506
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,120
 And that's where the bang got its name from.

507
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,120
 Really?

508
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:50,920
 I didn't know that.

509
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,480
 brackets, I haven't also heard of the band.

510
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,360
 It contains 200 million sperm.

511
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,120
 If you lined up all the sperm in one ejaculate,

512
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,120
 it'd stretch six miles.

513
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,120
 So you managed to get your sperm into one line.

514
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,320
 It's six miles up.

515
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,320
 I don't know.

516
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,560
 If you're asking them all to queue up in the blink,

517
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,040
 you need a spatula or something.

518
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,160
 You with two heads to the back.

519
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,000
 The man who first discovered the man who first saw sperm

520
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,560
 under a microscope who was called Van Liewenhook.

521
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,800
 So he discovered them in 1677.

522
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,360
 He was very clear whenever he wrote about it,

523
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,280
 I'll spoke about that.

524
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,400
 The sperm that I found were not obtained

525
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,960
 by any sinful contrivance on my part,

526
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,920
 but were the excess which nature provided me

527
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,920
 in conjugal relation.

528
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:37,200
 One thing I found is that it takes five people

529
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,640
 to get semen out of a vulture.

530
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,960
 Right.

531
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,240
 Is that your first hand experience?

532
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,320
 I've got that news for you.

533
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,560
 Andy, there's only four of us.

534
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:51,160
 What am I going to do with this guy?

535
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,080
 No, one person takes the limbs, one takes the head,

536
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,960
 one takes the wings, a fourth person massages it back.

537
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,280
 So after the massage, the bird gets aroused

538
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,960
 and then it's a cloaca appears, which

539
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,320
 is like the sexual opening that my spurts have.

540
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,520
 And then so the fourth person then grabs the cloaca

541
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,000
 between Tham and index finger, at which point the fifth person

542
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,960
 collects the semen in a glass funnel.

543
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,720
 All receptacle of their choice.

544
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,320
 It doesn't matter.

545
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,880
 Once you've gone to that much effort, though,

546
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,960
 you may as well get a glass funnel.

547
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,640
 And that's the stag night over.

548
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,000
 [LAUGHTER]

549
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:27,160
 OK, final fact of the show.

550
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,680
 And we head over to Andy Murray.

551
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,280
 My fact is that the English language

552
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,360
 has more words borrowed from Hawaiian than it has from Welsh,

553
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,360
 which is surprising.

554
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,280
 Yeah, because it's quite a long way away, Hawaiian.

555
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,120
 And whereas Wales is quite close.

556
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,440
 Almost next door.

557
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,280
 [LAUGHTER]

558
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,280
 So let me think.

559
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,800
 So maybe that is because things in Hawaii are more unusual

560
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,040
 to us, things that are in Wales, we just

561
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,440
 use the English words for our past.

562
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,480
 Well, possibly, but there seems to be a theory

563
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,720
 that it's actually snobbery, that it was Anglo-Saxon snobbery

564
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,440
 that repressed the Welsh language.

565
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,800
 And it was suppressed for a long time in the 19th century.

566
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,720
 So this is acclaimed by Dr. Philip Durkin,

567
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,560
 who's the author of borrowed words.

568
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,840
 And he's also the deputy editor of the OED.

569
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,680
 So he knows his stuff.

570
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,280
 And he's ranked a lot of different languages in terms

571
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,720
 of how many words from them have ended up in the OED.

572
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,840
 And Latin comes first and French comes second.

573
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:26,040
 But Hawaiian manages to beat Welsh, as does Turkish and Icelandic.

574
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,480
 Hawaiian words that we have include things

575
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,680
 like a hula hoop from Hula, the hula does,

576
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,960
 ukulele, aloha, and wiki, which means quickly.

577
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,240
 So wikipedia.

578
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,800
 So if you go to Hawaii, I've been to Hawaii,

579
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,680
 and if you get a bus from the airport to wherever you need to go,

580
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,600
 they're called wiki, wiki buses, because they're quinks, right?

581
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,800
 There's a bunch of words that I think someone

582
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,520
 recently wrote a book on was that the English language

583
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,720
 used to have that we should bring back,

584
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,000
 but the only one that springs to mind is fizzle,

585
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,120
 which used to mean in the 15th and 16th centuries,

586
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,000
 it was a verb, it meant to break wind without making a noise.

587
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,400
 Which you don't have anymore, but apparently, yeah.

588
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,280
 Fizzle is where we get the word feisty from.

589
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,760
 Andy, you actually have invented new words, haven't you,

590
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,640
 for you were one of the kind of silent authors

591
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,720
 of the new meaning of the lift book after this.

592
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,080
 It was a book there, what was it, Andy?

593
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:15,760
 It's a book there.

594
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,720
 It's a book of things that there should be words for,

595
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,520
 but aren't.

596
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,720
 So the original one was in the 80s, and it was one of the words,

597
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,000
 and that was Abilene, which is the pleasant coolness

598
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,640
 on the other side of a pillow, which is lovely.

599
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,560
 There's no word for that on a hot night when you turn

600
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,240
 your pillow over, oh, it's so nice.

601
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,640
 So all the words in it, all the definitions

602
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,680
 of real place names from around the world,

603
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,240
 matched with things that--

604
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,280
 Experiences that don't yet have a word to condense them.

605
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,080
 Exactly, yes.

606
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,120
 So Angram, an amusing anagram you've come up with,

607
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:45,280
 which doesn't quite work, for example.

608
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,800
 Or Dambi Whisk, which is the bit of kitchen equipment,

609
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,040
 that you don't know what it's for, but it always

610
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,240
 means that you can't quite shut the drawer properly.

611
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,880
 And you have to sort of charm it in.

612
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,640
 So that kind of stuff, that's great.

613
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,960
 Going to the Welsh thing, there are several thousand people

614
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,120
 in Patagonia in Argentina who descended from the Welsh

615
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,880
 and speak Welsh and Spanish as their two main languages.

616
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,040
 There are nearly as many Welsh speakers there

617
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,120
 as their own Wales.

618
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,240
 That's bizarre.

619
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:10,440
 Yeah.

620
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,480
 I really love it when language gets kind of preserved,

621
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,440
 because you're in an isolated place.

622
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,960
 I remember going to North Carolina

623
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,680
 and being right on the coastline.

624
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,320
 And obviously, that's where some of the first people

625
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,720
 landed from a South-West coast.

626
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,840
 And everyone there spoke with kind of a really thick Devonshire

627
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,200
 accent.

628
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,200
 It's so weird.

629
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,200
 So you're in North Carolina.

630
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,320
 And people are talking like this to you.

631
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,120
 I'm not very good at that accent.

632
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,880
 I'll be proud to present Palmerston Island, I think,

633
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,720
 in the middle of the Pacific.

634
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,640
 And they all speak with a Gloucestershire accent.

635
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,440
 Yeah, that's so clear.

636
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,320
 This is not a real island.

637
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,160
 Oh, really?

638
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,200
 My favourite word is Grockel, which is a Devon word,

639
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,960
 which means somebody's not from around here.

640
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,800
 Yeah, that's good.

641
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,800
 Very definitely.

642
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,400
 I'm not from Grockel.

643
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,200
 The Hawaiians have a word for that, actually.

644
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,160
 How, how, how, how, how, how, something like that,

645
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,240
 which means someone who's not from around there.

646
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:54,920
 Oh, yeah.

647
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,720
 Yeah, yeah.

648
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,720
 There are some other Hawaiian words,

649
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,760
 which we should probably borrow in a bit,

650
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,800
 similar to what we do with Afterlif.

651
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,240
 These are quite cool words.

652
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,840
 Makahaka-haka is someone with deep-set eyeballs.

653
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,720
 Which is very good.

654
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,520
 Oh, that's me.

655
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,320
 I've got deep-set eyes.

656
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:09,840
 Is it?

657
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,680
 Oh, yeah.

658
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,320
 If you're listening at home, we can barely see Danzai's,

659
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,880
 because they're just so far away.

660
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,560
 [LAUGHTER]

661
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,200
 There's another one.

662
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,760
 It's Ulaia, which means to live like a hermit

663
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,240
 because of disappointment.

664
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,080
 Wow.

665
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,520
 Oh, my god, that's amazing.

666
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,560
 It's very specific as well.

667
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,160
 The fact that you need a word for that implies

668
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,640
 that there are a lot of people living as hermits

669
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,160
 because of disappointment.

670
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,160
 [LAUGHTER]

671
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,920
 They should meet up and not be hermits anymore.

672
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,720
 That is just--

673
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,520
 This is completely off-topic.

674
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,240
 But do you know that thing about the hermits

675
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,040
 in like the first of the fourth century?

676
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,920
 It was a fashion for people who were religious

677
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,200
 to go and live in the desert as a hermit.

678
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,800
 A few people did it, and then it became more fashionable,

679
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,920
 and more fashionable, and more fashionable still.

680
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,160
 And then you have all these writings of these hermits

681
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,920
 living in the desert going, I can't move

682
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,240
 for all these other hermits.

683
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,560
 It's just totally hermit.

684
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,360
 I read the other day that one of the things

685
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,960
 that people used to do to sort out their melancholy--

686
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,000
 this was the rich back in the days--

687
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,480
 that they would hire a hermit to live on their grounds,

688
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,760
 and they would build a hermitage.

689
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,360
 And they would go and talk to that hermit,

690
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,360
 and then they would let the problem sit with the hermit,

691
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,160
 and the hermit would then just mull on them on their behalf.

692
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,400
 But sometimes, if you couldn't afford the hermit,

693
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,840
 they would often just build the hermitage.

694
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,200
 They would leave items in particular positions.

695
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,880
 So they looked like the hermit was just--

696
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,960
 he'd just gone out for a walk.

697
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,400
 He was showing off to your rich friends.

698
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,240
 Oh, I've got a hermit.

699
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,440
 Oh, he must be out of the moment.

700
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,080
 He's out socialising.

701
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,240
 He's gone out on the town.

702
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,200
 You don't really need to do that, because all you have to do

703
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,120
 is say, oh, he's a hermit.

704
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,360
 He doesn't like to be disfigured.

705
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,520
 I don't think that's true.

706
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,800
 I can't believe there was a theory

707
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,320
 that it might make you less melancholy

708
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,800
 to go and rearrange the furniture in your fake hermitage house.

709
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,920
 It sounds like I would walk out of that house

710
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,680
 and commit suicide immediately.

711
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,240
 What's my life at a girl?

712
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,720
 Somebody from the University of Leicester School

713
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,360
 in English who was researching the hermit thing

714
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,240
 said that they would leave reading matter and glasses out,

715
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,360
 a bit like leaving Cheryale for Father Christmas.

716
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,280
 So--

717
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,920
 Yeah, so to look like he was there.

718
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,440
 And yeah.

719
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,720
 I think that's quite charming.

720
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,240
 Yeah, yeah.

721
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,040
 And then they'd pretend to turn the pages

722
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,880
 and put a bit more on kind of new page.

723
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,880
 We're more on kind of it every day.

724
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,640
 Yeah.

725
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,240
 Oh, he's really got a long way with Little Dorit.

726
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,200
 Words that we do get just going back to Welsh,

727
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,920
 because we've gone so far off topic.

728
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,480
 But words that we do get from Welsh

729
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,920
 include flannel, flummery, corgi, and dad.

730
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,480
 Dad.

731
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,480
 Yeah.

732
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,800
 That was a pretty big hit, sir.

733
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,840
 But not mom.

734
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,960
 No, not mom.

735
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:36,760
 Isn't Ma the universal word from mother as a result of all babies?

736
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,000
 It's pretty youthful.

737
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,080
 But there is a place.

738
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,080
 And I think it's Georgia or Armenia,

739
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,840
 where the word for mother is dada.

740
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,360
 Yeah.

741
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,160
 It's one of very few places in the world.

742
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,520
 The corgi thing's quite interesting,

743
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,720
 because it means that the correct plural of corgi

744
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,200
 is cauguin, because that's the way the Welsh plural is made.

745
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,000
 You have another thing about plurals.

746
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,960
 The one is whenever I go to a sandwich shop,

747
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,880
 I get very annoyed if I ask Panini, and they only give me one.

748
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,040
 Because Panini is plural, and it should be--

749
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,560
 and I always ask for a Panino if I only want one of them.

750
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,480
 You're going to be perpetually disappointed.

751
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,680
 That is such a lovely god.

752
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,680
 And I never invite a QIL 30 kind of shop,

753
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,160
 because you're just going to be bantic at the hour and every day.

754
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,440
 Actually, there's no such thing as a fish.

755
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,760
 Get out of my fish and chip shop.

756
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,560
 You're one of the QILs, aren't you?

757
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,960
 Do you know what the state fish of Hawaii is?

758
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,240
 No, I'm going to tell you.

759
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,400
 It's the Humu, Humu, Nuku, Nuku, A-Pu, A-A.

760
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,840
 This is why we took from Hawaiian, rather than from Welsh,

761
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,360
 because they've lost so many vowels, and vowels

762
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,280
 are really easy to pronounce, aren't they?

763
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:45,280
 Hawaiian word, Humu, A-E-O-I-A, meaning certified,

764
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,720
 has the most consecutive vowels of any word

765
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,040
 in the current human speech.

766
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,200
 Just kind of sounds like they're drunk all the time, isn't it?

767
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,000
 If you're just alighting too many vowels--

768
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,760
 Sounds better than they're cornish.

769
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,120
 Yeah.

770
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,720
 I'll see you later.

771
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,680
 OK, we should wrap up.

772
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,920
 Just one final thing, Anna.

773
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,680
 One final thing, phonetomology.

774
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,360
 The first known use of the word abracadabra

775
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,120
 was from the third century, seems kind of weird to me,

776
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,120
 because he would have thought it was like a modern--

777
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,280
 I don't know, it sounds like such a weird modern concoction,

778
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,000
 but it was used in the third century by a doctor

779
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 who prescribed it as an anti-malarial.

780
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,560
 It was one of the first proposed cures for malaria, and you--

781
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,080
 Just to say abracadabra?

782
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,640
 Yeah, you actually have to wear it around your neck

783
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,520
 and an amulet, too.

784
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,480
 But I like the idea of someone going to the doctor.

785
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,240
 He's like, I'm feeling not very good.

786
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,320
 I think I'm a malaria.

787
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,000
 Oh, I've got the one thing for you.

788
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,040
 Abracadabra!

789
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,040
 Abracadabra!

790
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,640
 Yeah.

791
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,960
 Thanks, I feel much better.

792
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:42,200
 OK, that's it for our episode.

793
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,120
 That's all our facts.

794
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,800
 Thanks for listening to our show.

795
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,480
 If you want to get in touch with any of us

796
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,960
 about any of the things that we've said,

797
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,960
 you can reach us on our Twitter handles.

798
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,400
 James can be found on @xshaped.

799
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,560
 Andy, you're on @andruhontoem.

800
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,200
 I'm on @shriverland.

801
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,480
 Anna is not on Twitter at the moment.

802
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,480
 Again, she is still refraining from joining,

803
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,160
 but we will get her one day.

804
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:07,720
 In the meantime, she sets up our fantastic qi.com/podcast page

805
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,920
 where we're going to have links and videos and photos

806
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,200
 of all the things that we've spoken about over the course

807
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,120
 of this episode.

808
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,520
 So if you go there and check it out, that'd be great.

809
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,680
 And we'll see you guys again next week.

810
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,840
 So thanks for listening to No Such Thing as a Fish.

811
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,840
 Goodbye.
