00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:14,800
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,440
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,240
 a weekly podcast coming to you

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,680
 from the QI offices in Hoburn.

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,040
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,240
 I'm sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,400
 James Harkin and Anna Tyshinski.

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,720
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,720
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

11
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,360
 And in no particular order, here we go.

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,800
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Anna.

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,640
 - My fact this week is that if an eel

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,200
 ends up in a predator's stomach,

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,960
 it can reverse out through its gills.

16
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,160
 - That's pretty amazing.

17
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,640
 - This is Japanese eels.

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,840
 And it's recently found out that they can get swallowed

19
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,800
 by these sleeper fish, dark sleeper fish.

20
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,640
 And then they go through the digestive tract,

21
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,360
 but then they are just able to wibble their way back,

22
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,640
 back out towards the gills and then slink out.

23
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,360
 I think some slunk out through the mouth

24
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,760
 and then some were able to slink their way out

25
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,460
 actually through the slits that were the gills.

26
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,560
 - Yeah, that's amazing.

27
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,080
 I actually don't really have a good idea of fish anatomy.

28
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,560
 I wouldn't have thought that the gills

29
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,440
 would be attached to the digestive system.

30
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,780
 - It does sound all hollow, doesn't it?

31
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:21,620
 - Yeah.

32
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,460
 - We say that.

33
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,200
 - Our gills, as people.

34
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,040
 - Our lungs.

35
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,400
 - Yeah, are sort of connected.

36
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,160
 - You know, there's a bit where the pipe's branch, but--

37
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,000
 - That's true.

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,640
 It's like if you swallow a piece of apple

39
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,480
 the wrong way it goes down towards your lungs.

40
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,320
 - Exactly.

41
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,560
 I mean, kind of sort of the same way

42
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,400
 they're coming out of the bit.

43
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,560
 We use the breathing.

44
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,000
 - Yeah, you tend to take a few turns, probably.

45
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,840
 - Yeah, yeah.

46
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,680
 But it is mad.

47
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,520
 - It is insane.

48
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,360
 - And the scientists who did it,

49
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,240
 I love it, it was a team at Nagasaki University.

50
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,760
 And they filled the eels with the chemical

51
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,120
 that meant they could be x-ray,

52
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,640
 they could show up on an x-ray.

53
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,680
 And then, it was really a bit mean,

54
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,280
 they just introduced the eels to the dark sleeper fish,

55
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,320
 which we're gonna be very hungry for them.

56
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,360
 And one would get swallowed and then they'd just observe.

57
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,300
 And about a third of the time, the eel escaped.

58
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,560
 - That's interesting.

59
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,440
 Do we think it happens in the wild, then?

60
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,480
 - I think it definitely does.

61
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,880
 - Yeah, it does, I think.

62
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,760
 And they see that some make it halfway out,

63
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,080
 some almost make it out,

64
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,080
 but they get stuck with their heads.

65
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,640
 It's not, yeah, it's not a foolproof process.

66
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,560
 But what a weird thing to be the sleeper fish.

67
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,400
 You eat your lunch.

68
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,240
 - I know.

69
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,240
 - And then it's sitting next to you a minute later.

70
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,640
 - It does happen a bit in nature.

71
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,480
 Doesn't it?

72
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,440
 That things get eaten and then can escape.

73
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,280
 - Yes.

74
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,120
 - I reckon.

75
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,940
 Like Jonah.

76
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:30,780
 - Jonah?

77
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,620
 - I think is one of them.

78
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,460
 - Is that his nature?

79
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:36,640
 - There's a snail called Tornatelides boiningi

80
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,040
 that's also found in Japan.

81
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,960
 And it's swallowed by this bird.

82
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,160
 And 5% of them are able to escape out of the bum.

83
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,440
 - Out of the bum?

84
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,280
 - Out of the bum.

85
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,120
 - Okay.

86
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,960
 - That's all the way through.

87
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,800
 That's very impressive, isn't it?

88
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,640
 - That's a waiting game.

89
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,680
 - Well, on the other hand, you don't have to reverse.

90
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,520
 You just put your head down and go for it.

91
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,360
 - I do.

92
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,200
 - Yeah.

93
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,720
 - But then 5% of them can get through and survive

94
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,080
 for at least one week.

95
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,760
 And actually quite often when they come out,

96
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,720
 if it's a female who's pregnant,

97
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,960
 they'll give birth straight afterwards.

98
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,800
 And some people-

99
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,000
 - That, as in like it brings on neighbor.

100
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,840
 - Yeah.

101
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,880
 - Wow, like eating a curry or something.

102
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,960
 Maybe she did it on purpose.

103
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,800
 She was so sick, big time.

104
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,320
 - I don't think it's like in the Lansdale community,

105
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,960
 they're like, oh, maybe if we have sex,

106
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,720
 then the baby will come.

107
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,180
 And they're like, yeah, but maybe if we get eaten

108
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,520
 by a bird, it will come.

109
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,120
 - That's just the inducing method.

110
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,480
 Imagine that at hospitals,

111
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,240
 if you have to be swallowed by an animal at all.

112
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,680
 Baby needs to come early.

113
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,040
 I found this great book called Eels by James Prosek.

114
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,880
 It's one of those classic books that we love

115
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,240
 where it's just the single subject,

116
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,120
 the whole history of the animal.

117
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,120
 And it's pretty fascinating.

118
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,240
 We've spoken about before about how Eels,

119
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,280
 they have the call,

120
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,440
 which kind of brings them back to the ocean.

121
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,080
 'Cause they are born in salt water

122
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,520
 and they find river water in order to give birth.

123
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,560
 And most animals do the opposite of that.

124
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,280
 Salmon will do the opposite of that.

125
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,360
 They're so mysterious.

126
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,200
 And we've spoken about this.

127
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,360
 They've never, we just never have seen

128
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,080
 any pregnant Eels really or how they give birth.

129
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,360
 But what's fascinating is how strong that call is.

130
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,000
 So this guy, James Prosek,

131
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 he has some Eels in his house, in a tank.

132
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,600
 And he said he woke up one morning

133
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,240
 and they had busted through the top,

134
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,520
 which was held down with rocks

135
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,240
 and they were wriggling on the floor,

136
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,440
 just trying to get out.

137
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,520
 - You're joking.

138
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,440
 - So then he reinforced it, he put them back in,

139
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,680
 put the lid on and then he came down

140
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,640
 and they were slamming their heads into the sea.

141
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,440
 - They were constructing a rudimentary drill

142
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,920
 from the stuff in their tank.

143
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,760
 That was incredible.

144
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,720
 - So basically some of them,

145
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,520
 even like to the point of kill themselves,

146
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,760
 but they were smacking their heads

147
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,640
 so hard to try and get through this thing.

148
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,240
 - Okay, I'm not going to say that that's not true,

149
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,480
 but that's amazing.

150
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,320
 - It's horror film.

151
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,600
 - It's in his book and he's like a lead illness writer.

152
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,760
 - I was implying, there's a subtext there that I think.

153
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,920
 There is a thing that when they first realized

154
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,760
 that there was a homininstinct in birds,

155
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,840
 one of the experiments they did was,

156
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,080
 they got the birds in a cage

157
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,720
 and put little sort of ink on their feet

158
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,080
 and then they would put paper on the floor of the cage

159
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,520
 and then they could see that the birds

160
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,080
 were trying to go in a certain direction.

161
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,920
 - Right.

162
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,760
 - God, it's so interesting.

163
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,800
 - It is amazing 'cause they will often,

164
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,320
 if there's a bit of damp ground in a field,

165
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,080
 they will make their way out of their pond

166
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,640
 or whatever bit of fresh water they're in

167
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,640
 and they'll slither along

168
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,200
 and start eating some farmland stuff and come back.

169
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,960
 But when they want to go back to the ocean,

170
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,280
 this is all true, James.

171
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,520
 They can stay in wait.

172
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,680
 They just wait and wait until the circumstances are right

173
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,160
 to get them back to the ocean.

174
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,920
 And then once they need to make that trip,

175
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,120
 once a storm has come

176
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,520
 and the water levels have risen a bit

177
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,640
 and everything's wet,

178
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,160
 they perform like ninja-like abilities.

179
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,120
 So if they get to a hill,

180
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,320
 they roll into a ball and roll down the hill.

181
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,160
 - No way.

182
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,000
 - Yeah, yeah.

183
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,760
 They can climb up walls by braiding themselves

184
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,600
 along the side of moths, walls, and it's extraordinary.

185
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,800
 - Did you watch a cartoon?

186
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,440
 - This is James Prasek, Eels.

187
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,600
 - It is incredible.

188
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,120
 Do you know where has an eel festival, by the way?

189
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,960
 - Eely?

190
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,760
 - Because, oh, Eely, yeah, Eely.

191
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,760
 - Correct.

192
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,600
 - Which one?

193
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,440
 - Eely.

194
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,280
 - Well, there we go.

195
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,120
 - Not Eely, London.

196
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,960
 - It wasn't a trick question.

197
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,400
 It was actually just an on-the-nose.

198
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,280
 - Because Eely is named after the eels, isn't it?

199
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,320
 - I believe so.

200
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,040
 But very sadly, the last eel catcher in Eely

201
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,680
 retired 10 years ago.

202
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,640
 Because they've had this terrible decline of population,

203
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,720
 mostly due to humans.

204
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,280
 But you know, there used to be a staple food in Cambridgeshire.

205
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,720
 I just find that so bizarre.

206
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,560
 - Yeah.

207
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,400
 - You just, like, a thousand years ago,

208
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,480
 you had a rock, you had an eel, effectively.

209
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,840
 And the main thing to do now is removing barriers in rivers.

210
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,160
 'Cause there are just so many

211
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,520
 hundreds and thousands of these things.

212
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,040
 And most of them are out at, like, a defunct.

213
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,960
 They're like an old water mill.

214
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,800
 - Yeah.

215
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,640
 - You know, build a barrier across the river

216
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,800
 'cause they needed to harness the power of--

217
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,640
 - And locks and stuff.

218
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,800
 Like, we've got quite a lot of eel,

219
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,760
 we've got quite a lot of eel stares near us.

220
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,600
 - Do you know?

221
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,440
 - Which would like to go over locks,

222
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,280
 'cause I live in the Fens,

223
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,120
 which is where they used to be all over the stuff.

224
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,960
 - Yes.

225
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,800
 - Like your eel country.

226
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,620
 - Were it?

227
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,460
 Well, yeah, I'm really, yeah.

228
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:43,920
 It's really hard to get an atlas of eel barriers

229
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,700
 because the researchers looking at it found

230
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,220
 there are 300 different words

231
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,340
 which describe obstacles and rivers.

232
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,260
 Which I find insane. - Really?

233
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,180
 - You know, a sluice, or a lock, or a weir,

234
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,740
 or, like, all of these things.

235
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,260
 There are hundreds of terms, so you need to map them.

236
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,340
 But there aren't, like, groups removing them slowly,

237
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,500
 but surely, which is very cool.

238
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,700
 - I think it's a bit mysterious

239
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,260
 why their numbers have declined so rapidly, you know,

240
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,100
 by 90% in the last 50 years.

241
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,740
 But they're so sought after now.

242
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:13,100
 - There are 350 million eels taken from Europe to Asia

243
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:13,940
 every year.

244
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,780
 - Is this legal or illegal?

245
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,100
 - All illegal, very illegal.

246
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,140
 - This is smug eel, smuggling?

247
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,140
 - Yes, because they're very endangered now,

248
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,180
 and so they're very protected.

249
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,900
 You're only allowed to take certain ones and...

250
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,380
 - I'd love if they get there,

251
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,900
 and then they wake up the next morning

252
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,460
 after having arrived,

253
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,380
 all the eels have just migrated back.

254
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,700
 (all laughing)

255
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,940
 - Eel shape holes in all of the buildings.

256
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,020
 (all laughing)

257
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,340
 - Which are just holes, aren't they?

258
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,460
 (all laughing)

259
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:40,180
 - Well, if they might go sideways through the wall.

260
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,660
 Speaking of smuggling, or not speaking of smuggling,

261
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,180
 but you'll see where the connection is.

262
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,540
 Last year, there was doctors in Vietnam

263
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:51,020
 who pulled out a two-foot eel from man's intestines

264
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,420
 after he inserted it into his bottom.

265
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,860
 - Oh, dear.

266
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,900
 - And the problem was not so much putting the eel up there,

267
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,940
 although that was quite bad,

268
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,620
 but he'd also shoved a lemon up there

269
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,180
 so that it couldn't escape.

270
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:05,940
 - No, I don't believe this, James.

271
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,060
 - Well, it's true, it's true.

272
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,660
 - It sounds like he's trying to make a delicious meal

273
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,500
 inside himself, a squeeze of lemon,

274
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,380
 and then was it a sprinkle of salt?

275
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,740
 - The man survived,

276
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,980
 even though the eel had started biting

277
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,860
 through his abdominal cavity.

278
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,100
 - I don't think we can blame the eel a touch for that.

279
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,260
 - No, no, I've not blamed the eel, I've not.

280
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,620
 - I'm blaming you for raising this,

281
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,180
 and I certainly, for one, I'm not finding it funny,

282
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,660
 because I'm well aware that in 2013,

283
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,740
 there was a similar, very serious incident,

284
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:36,060
 and 33 people, staff at Auckland City Hospital,

285
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,140
 were punished, and a few of them sacked

286
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,540
 for looking at an x-ray unnecessarily

287
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,620
 of a man who had an eel stuck

288
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,380
 in the lowest parts of his digestive system.

289
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,580
 - Well, you can get fired for looking at an x-ray?

290
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,740
 - It was found that they did not need

291
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,940
 to be looking at the x-ray, all his notes.

292
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,500
 - Oh, I can see his notes. - Oh, come on.

293
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,500
 - Maybe if it has incriminating--

294
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,660
 - Down over here, speaking up for medical malpractice.

295
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,140
 (all laughing)

296
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,500
 If as long as it's funny.

297
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,980
 - You have to learn.

298
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,540
 - As a doctor, to see things you would not normally see.

299
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,580
 - Exactly, what happens if then the next day,

300
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,180
 someone else comes with an eagle up the bum,

301
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,140
 but you don't recognize it?

302
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,740
 - Yeah, sorry, I don't know what to do.

303
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,060
 It was too funny, and I wasn't allowed to do it.

304
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,300
 (all laughing)

305
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:19,060
 - Do you know where European and American eels come from?

306
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,020
 - European America?

307
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,700
 - No, the ocean bits, where they're born, do you know?

308
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,860
 - They haven't been said on the orders from the Sargasso Sea.

309
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:27,500
 - Sargasso Sea, but do you know where the Sargasso Sea is?

310
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,060
 - It's in the Atlantic. - Is it Bermuda?

311
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,220
 - It's Bermuda. - Oh, God.

312
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,300
 - Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

313
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,900
 It is within the Triangle.

314
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,020
 Let's head this off at the path.

315
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,180
 - Is it within the Triangle?

316
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,900
 - Well, the Triangle is an undefined border.

317
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,900
 We don't really know how far the Triangle extends.

318
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,740
 - Are we in the Triangle now?

319
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,940
 - Technically, yes.

320
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:46,340
 - I thought it went from Bermuda to the tip of Florida

321
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,300
 to the tip of South America.

322
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,660
 I thought it was defined, no.

323
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,420
 - I don't know, I don't really know about this stuff.

324
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,340
 (all laughing)

325
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,260
 - It might be my area of interest.

326
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,540
 It might be a lumpy triangle.

327
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,860
 There might be a little bit of flexibility.

328
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,780
 - I heard it on a podcast called The Crypto-Tactics.

329
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:05,020
 They were very clear about the definitions.

330
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,300
 - Oh, well, trust them, great show.

331
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,260
 - What's your theory?

332
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,100
 They're all getting started outside there.

333
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,620
 - Just saying the mystery of them,

334
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,220
 I can't believe that hasn't been folded in

335
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,260
 as an extraordinary creation.

336
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:19,100
 - If they're being called to a, let's say a mothership,

337
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,340
 metaphorically speaking,

338
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,780
 that's they're being drawn to a mothership, aren't they?

339
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,620
 - And they talk about it.

340
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,020
 They say the mystery of them being,

341
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,700
 this calling to the Sargasso Sea.

342
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,940
 They left as glass eggs, basically, in their look.

343
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,340
 They get carried in the currents all over the world.

344
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,180
 They end up in fresh water.

345
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,220
 They live there up to a hundred years.

346
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,460
 And then they somehow find their way back to the Sargasso.

347
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:45,420
 - I suppose that is also true of many, many, many other species

348
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,780
 that they managed to go back to their original breeding grounds.

349
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,860
 - They are mysterious, aren't they?

350
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,100
 They are kind of, it's incredible we haven't cracked it.

351
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,900
 Even with all our knowledge.

352
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,540
 You know, you can, all your computers and all of that

353
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,900
 and all your internet and you still can't do it, can you?

354
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,820
 - Can't crack the eels.

355
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,220
 - Yeah, get on to it, eel on musk.

356
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,300
 - Oh God.

357
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,540
 - Well done, well done.

358
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,700
 Let's distract them with that.

359
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,740
 We've mostly been talking about,

360
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,300
 yeah, European and European eels.

361
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,820
 But conger eels, we have, and they're massive.

362
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,060
 And they all hold on to each other.

363
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,900
 - They all go back to the Sargasso Sea in one big line.

364
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,580
 Apart from when one line of congery

365
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,220
 is accidentally breaks off and goes to the wrong place.

366
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,140
 - That's the European eel, the American eel.

367
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,820
 - No, the conger eels, different spelling,

368
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,940
 are, well, hunted all over British Isles,

369
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,540
 particularly in Cornwall and the Isles of Silly.

370
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,260
 And I just read in an old book,

371
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,420
 and I can't find it anywhere else,

372
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,820
 but the way to catch conger eels,

373
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,460
 you know, sometimes you'll put a stick into a river

374
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,900
 and the eels would wind around it and then you'd pull it up.

375
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,740
 - Didn't know that, okay.

376
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,820
 - I think that's what people did.

377
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,020
 Well, apparently the traditional way to catch them

378
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:55,580
 in the Isles of Silly is you suspend a small boy

379
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:58,660
 upside down in front of the hole in which they live,

380
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,020
 wait for the eel to wrap itself around him.

381
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,500
 And these things can be up to three meters long.

382
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,820
 And then you pull the boy up.

383
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,740
 - Why does he need to be upside down?

384
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,020
 - I think maybe he wants me to grab them.

385
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,860
 - He would get ahead of it before too long, this boy.

386
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:13,900
 - I think they come pretty fast.

387
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,340
 - We don't seem to be concerned about his welfare,

388
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,660
 so it's fine, but.

389
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,060
 - He's happy to oblige.

390
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,540
 He gets some of the jelly deal.

391
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,900
 - Do you guys remember, I'm sure I pitched an eel fact

392
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,820
 about six months ago and it didn't get any traction

393
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,160
 with you guys.

394
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,000
 - Oh, there we go.

395
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,700
 - It was because in my local news agent,

396
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,620
 they had a fisherman monthly magazine.

397
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,140
 And it had a picture on the front of a guy

398
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,780
 with the largest eel you've ever seen.

399
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,620
 It was incredible.

400
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,540
 - Yeah, but that's not a fact.

401
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,380
 That's the thing.

402
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,740
 You can't just say my fact this week

403
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,420
 is you get really big eels.

404
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,740
 - He'd broken the record for biggest eel caught in Britain.

405
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:42,620
 I can't remember his name now.

406
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,780
 I wrote it down at the time, but I've forgotten it.

407
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,780
 - And what was the fact?

408
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,020
 - It's just like the record for the largest eel

409
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,300
 fished in Britain have been smashed by this guy.

410
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,100
 But guys, honestly, it was like an elephant's trunk.

411
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:53,940
 It was incredible.

412
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,780
 - Yeah.

413
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,740
 - It was a few feet long.

414
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,940
 - I think this is maybe because this was this period

415
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,980
 where all your facts were the most massive kettle

416
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,420
 in just everything was an undefinable size.

417
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,780
 You refused to tell us the measurements of.

418
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,820
 - It was a trolley big eel.

419
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,540
 Anyway, I bought that magazine and I think I'm sure

420
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,060
 there's a fisherman near where I live

421
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,540
 who's gone absolutely devastated

422
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,180
 'cause he trots along to his news agent

423
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,780
 for the one copy they stocked with this magazine.

424
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,460
 It's not a big rack of them.

425
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:22,340
 - Oh, he's missed the biggest eel news in the century.

426
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,620
 - He's still living in a full paradise.

427
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,980
 - He's done the time, Andy.

428
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,260
 He owned that edition.

429
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:30,340
 I feel like there's an elephant in the room

430
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,980
 given that we're doing a fact about things

431
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,380
 surviving being eaten.

432
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,540
 In years to come, people will have forgotten this news story

433
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,340
 that has been quite big this month

434
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,780
 of the person who's been eaten by a whale.

435
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:42,540
 - He was a kayaker, wasn't he, a Venezuelan guy?

436
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,380
 - Did that happen?

437
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,860
 'Cause I saw the headline, didn't read the article

438
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:48,300
 and then saw a debunk and didn't read the article either.

439
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,140
 - It did happen.

440
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:52,460
 - The video is quite good.

441
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,300
 - The video is amazing.

442
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,820
 - How enticing does something have to be there

443
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,060
 before you all click on it?

444
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:00,540
 - I go through a lot of web pages every single day.

445
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,860
 - I'm like, yeah, yeah, whatever.

446
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:02,940
 - He got into the world's mouth

447
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,780
 and then the world's matter of mouth.

448
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,580
 - So he did go through into this.

449
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,420
 - No, no, no.

450
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,260
 There was no happening. - It was a few seconds later.

451
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,420
 I actually, I heard about this story on a recent episode

452
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,380
 of what was the show you were talking about?

453
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,220
 Cryptid fact.

454
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:15,940
 - They did a really good breakdown of that whole story.

455
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,900
 - Did you go through that bit by bit?

456
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,740
 - They did, yeah.

457
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,580
 - Actually, that was the thing

458
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,580
 where I saw the headline that just scrolled past it.

459
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,460
 (all laughing)

460
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,700
 - Very sensible.

461
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,620
 - I saw the weird thing about it.

462
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,180
 Well, there were two, there were two quite sweet things.

463
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,980
 So they were going on a kayaking trip

464
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,300
 for this guy's dad's birthday.

465
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,580
 Initially, the headlines were like,

466
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,140
 caught on camera by his dad.

467
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,900
 And I thought, oh my God, this insensitive father's

468
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,340
 filming the whole bloody thing.

469
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,540
 But he did have a kayak mounted camera.

470
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,980
 If that's what anyone else is worried about,

471
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,940
 he wasn't holding the camera rather than saving his boy.

472
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,700
 - Yeah, oh yeah, did you take the picture

473
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,420
 of the insensitive dad on your show?

474
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,660
 - I defended him because I think that if you know

475
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,260
 the eating habits, you'd probably go,

476
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,380
 he's not going to swallow him.

477
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,660
 He'll be back in a second.

478
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,620
 - That's about defense.

479
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,220
 - And also, he was a distance away.

480
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,060
 - Yeah.

481
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:00,900
 - What are you going to do?

482
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,220
 Swim over and have a word?

483
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,580
 You just keep filming at that point.

484
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,980
 - You're both fathers.

485
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,180
 - Also, you'll need a crime reference number

486
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,980
 from the police, so they need evidence.

487
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,980
 Take it from me.

488
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,580
 - I mean, I'm not normally on the side of this kind of thing,

489
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,380
 but I've just been skiing with my three-year-old

490
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,620
 for the number of times I've filmed her falling over

491
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,100
 as opposed to going and helping her.

492
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:18,940
 - Yeah.

493
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,300
 - Right, you guys, social services are coming for everyone.

494
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,660
 Imagine, this is all right.

495
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,900
 I'm sure he'll come out with a mouth any time now.

496
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,220
 So it was mounted on his kayak,

497
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,580
 so the dad was not just holding a camera filming him,

498
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,700
 but I thought the quite interesting thing

499
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,500
 about human reactions is the dad didn't make a sound

500
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,580
 when it happened, so he's seen what happens,

501
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,580
 but he's so shocked.

502
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,420
 And when the guy was then spat out of the whale's mouth,

503
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,140
 the dad was like, mate, you're okay.

504
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,540
 Shit, don't panic.

505
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,460
 It's still there.

506
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,620
 Get back in your kayak.

507
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,580
 - But it's silent.

508
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,540
 I see, what does his son get followed by a whale?

509
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,700
 - Well, men don't like talking to each other.

510
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,540
 What do you want?

511
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,940
 (all laughing)

512
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,460
 Unless it's in a podcast format.

513
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,060
 - Even then, the only question is,

514
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,020
 is that the new kayak that's just been...

515
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,060
 (all laughing)

516
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,540
 - I think we want to normalize this,

517
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,900
 and we want to say to guys, if you're listening to this,

518
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,820
 if your son has ever eaten by a whale,

519
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,420
 then do try and talk about it.

520
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,580
 - Yeah.

521
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,420
 - Yeah, make yourself.

522
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,260
 - Be a legend.

523
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,420
 Have a chat.

524
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:10,000
 (upbeat music)

525
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,080
 (upbeat music)

526
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,240
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two,

527
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,440
 and that is James.

528
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,860
 - Okay, my fact this week is that

529
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,760
 Sweden's Minister for Equality

530
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:23,360
 has a pathological fear of bananas.

531
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,920
 - But all bananas equally.

532
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,160
 (all laughing)

533
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,760
 - Very nice.

534
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,600
 - Yeah.

535
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,480
 - This is incredible.

536
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,720
 I mean, it really is a fear, isn't it?

537
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,680
 - It's, well, yes, it is a fear.

538
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,380
 It was in the newspapers quite recently,

539
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:40,980
 especially in Sweden, unsurprisingly.

540
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,320
 - That's where it started, didn't it?

541
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,440
 - Yeah, "Sweet Afraid of Bananas."

542
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,280
 - Oh, yeah.

543
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,280
 - She herself is a vegetable, yes?

544
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,480
 - Oh, yeah.

545
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,320
 - I suppose so.

546
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,300
 - Sweet, sweet.

547
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,780
 - She, there was some leaked emails

548
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:55,220
 to a tabloid newspaper called Expressen,

549
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,980
 and they said that this lady,

550
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,140
 who's called Paulina Brandberg,

551
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,280
 has a strong allergy to bananas,

552
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,660
 so we would appreciate it if there were no bananas

553
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,140
 in the room where she'll be staying.

554
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,820
 And the big scandal really is

555
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,460
 that she isn't allergic to bananas.

556
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,700
 She's just scared of them.

557
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,540
 - Yes.

558
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,500
 - And she said, like, they asked her,

559
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,220
 they were like, "Are you really allergic to bananas?"

560
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:19,200
 And she's like, "Well, it's sort of analogy, you could say.

561
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,780
 It's something that I got professional help for."

562
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,260
 And then eventually it came out

563
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,620
 that she was just really hated them.

564
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:27,700
 But, I mean, in fairness, you know, it's equally bad.

565
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,980
 Is it equally bad?

566
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,700
 Well, it depends how bad your allergy is.

567
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,860
 - Yeah, I don't think it's, this is a big,

568
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,660
 I don't think this is a big scandal.

569
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:37,100
 There have been bigger in the world of politics.

570
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,580
 - I know Sweden's politics are, you know, changing,

571
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,820
 but it's still, guys,

572
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,980
 if this is still what you're concerned with.

573
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:43,820
 - And you know what?

574
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,260
 Like, the opposition party,

575
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,900
 they could have taken advantage of this

576
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,420
 and maybe brought down the Swedish government.

577
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:53,180
 But one of the opposition social democrats,

578
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:57,500
 Teresa Carvalho said that she also has fear of bananas.

579
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,340
 - I love that.

580
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,740
 - And on this issue, we stand united

581
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,100
 against a common enemy.

582
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:01,940
 - Yeah.

583
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,100
 - That's not plausible.

584
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,940
 So I'll try to jump on the bandwagon.

585
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,500
 - There can't be two, you're right.

586
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,420
 - It's quite a rare phobia.

587
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,260
 - Well, I think it's lovely.

588
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:12,460
 And she, you know, she can't just spot a banana

589
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,500
 and be alarmed by it.

590
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,140
 She can smell bananas

591
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:18,100
 or if someone has recently eaten a banana in the room,

592
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,340
 she can truffle that out.

593
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,860
 - You know why, speaking of truffles,

594
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:24,260
 it's a bit like my severe hatred of mushrooms.

595
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,100
 - Yeah.

596
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:25,940
 - Isn't it?

597
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:26,780
 Like, I can tell if there's a mushroom

598
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,100
 in someone's eater mushrooms recently and stuff.

599
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,340
 - You don't have a phobia of mushrooms.

600
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,260
 - I think I do really, actually, yeah.

601
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,140
 - I find them really disgusting,

602
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,100
 but also if there's one growing in the corner,

603
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,940
 I'll try not walk near it kind of thing.

604
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,620
 - It's a stronger version to something

605
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,980
 which actually is not gonna harm you.

606
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,620
 - The Prime Minister backed her as well.

607
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,780
 He sort of said, yeah.

608
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,180
 So like, when he found out it was a phobia.

609
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,700
 - What was the alternative to sack her, basically?

610
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,260
 - I think she was getting mocked

611
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,260
 and he said we shouldn't be mocking people

612
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,620
 for their various little known phobias.

613
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,460
 - Well, it's hard, isn't it?

614
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,580
 'Cause loads of people have phobias

615
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,420
 of things that are quite mainstream.

616
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:01,340
 I mean, like, height, is that a phobia?

617
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,460
 - It's a bit dangerous.

618
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,220
 Spiders, some spiders are dangerous, you know.

619
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,700
 - I would say these are phobias.

620
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,900
 'Cause these are like, they're phobias of things

621
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,380
 that aren't going to harm you.

622
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:14,300
 A phobia of spiders in this country is totally rational.

623
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,580
 - There is a theory that there's some kind of spider called,

624
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,860
 I think it's called the six-eyed,

625
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,180
 I can't remember, is it? - More spider.

626
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,540
 - It's a bad one.

627
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:24,700
 And it can be lethal if it bites a human.

628
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,300
 And that lives in the plains of Africa,

629
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,820
 which are the cradle of humanity.

630
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,820
 So maybe there's something genetic going on there.

631
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,500
 So that might be where spider fear comes from.

632
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,500
 - Yeah, six-eyed, sound spider.

633
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,340
 - And spider, there you go.

634
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,780
 - And I think the problem, like,

635
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,780
 the reason that the Prime Minister of Sweden

636
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,340
 and the opposition sort of backed her on this

637
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,340
 is, one, because it's ridiculous

638
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,140
 that anyone should care about it.

639
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,740
 But two, because it was kind of distracting

640
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,460
 from the good work that this woman's doing

641
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,420
 in her equality. - The famously unequal

642
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,620
 country of Sweden. (laughing)

643
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,660
 - It's not as obscure as you think.

644
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,220
 It was an issue that was brought up on Loose Women

645
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,500
 because one of the stars, Charlene White,

646
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,020
 has a phobia of bananas as well.

647
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:58,860
 - I don't know. - Yeah.

648
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,260
 - It's common, all these people suddenly claiming.

649
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,620
 - There is one person with a banana phobia

650
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:07,020
 who is the most ironic person given the name.

651
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,860
 - Oh. - Can you guess who it is?

652
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,260
 - The guy who voiced Banana Man.

653
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,140
 - No. - No.

654
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,580
 - Banana Rama, the band? - Oh, the band.

655
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,860
 I actually checked to see if they were allergic.

656
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,300
 - The founder of the Big Yellow Storage Company.

657
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,620
 - Oh, very good, but no.

658
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:24,220
 So this person's surname is very related to bananas.

659
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,340
 - John Peele.

660
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,660
 - Very good, but no.

661
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,140
 - Okay. - Oh.

662
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:31,140
 - Monkey, something. - Famous types of banana.

663
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:34,220
 - Oh, Cavendish, the Duke of Cavendish.

664
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,020
 - Cyclist Mark Cavendish.

665
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,620
 - Yes, sorry. - All right.

666
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,660
 - We both know that it's the first Cavendish you think of.

667
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,660
 - The first Cavendish that all of our listeners

668
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,020
 will be thinking of when they hear that name,

669
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,060
 the Duke of Cavendish.

670
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,540
 No, Mark Cavendish, the cyclist,

671
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,060
 he says even seeing someone eating a banana

672
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,620
 gives him goosebumps and even thinking about it

673
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,860
 makes him gag.

674
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,060
 - That's incredible. - Wow.

675
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,620
 - And he said it's the stringy bits on a banana

676
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,900
 that he really hates.

677
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,340
 - They're not the best bits, for sure.

678
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,860
 - They're not the sweetest part.

679
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:09,380
 - Well, he once won a bike race in Elania in Turkey

680
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,860
 and he was given the world's biggest bunch of bananas

681
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,700
 at price.

682
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:16,180
 - Oh, God, that's terrible. - That's the scar of your fears.

683
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,340
 And that's why it's bad having one of these niche phobias

684
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,780
 because it's very hard to, like,

685
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,860
 no one presents you with it like a bouquet of pigeons

686
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,860
 at the end of it.

687
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,780
 - Another person who has a fear of bananas,

688
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,660
 Harriet Kemsley, the comedian.

689
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,500
 - The comedian.

690
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,500
 - Yeah, on another podcast called Off Menu,

691
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,340
 which I've never heard of.

692
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,660
 Have you guys heard of that?

693
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,700
 - No, I think it's the cryptid factor,

694
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,900
 I think the fans of it.

695
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:41,140
 - Yeah, well, she was on that and she said,

696
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:44,940
 she hates it when you throw a banana peel into a bin

697
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,780
 and it doesn't go all the way in

698
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,300
 so it looks like it's crawling out.

699
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,700
 - Yeah, I can see that. - And I think I can see that,

700
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,460
 actually. - Oh, gosh.

701
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,740
 People have a lot of time to think, don't they?

702
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,580
 (all laugh)

703
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,580
 - Sorry, but just...

704
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,420
 - I think it's instinct.

705
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,060
 - I mean, really, non-intended, yeah.

706
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,620
 Did we say that the Cavendish is named after,

707
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,540
 the Cavendish banana is named after the Duke of Cavendish?

708
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,580
 We'll just get emails otherwise.

709
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,100
 - I think we have meant, I think, yeah.

710
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,220
 - I think all of our listeners are very familiar

711
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,660
 with the Duke of Cavendish, aren't they?

712
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:13,460
 - Fears of bananas, the Guardian did a bit of digging

713
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:16,220
 into this, I think, off the back of the Swedish politician.

714
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:19,140
 They found a woman with a banana phobia who had it

715
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,460
 pretty strongly, like, again, breaks out in a sweat,

716
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,420
 can't bear being around them,

717
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,260
 avoids them in the supermarket, that kind of thing.

718
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,100
 She once was on a flight, quite a long-haul flight.

719
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,660
 She woke up in the morning after everyone on the flight

720
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,940
 had been asleep, and everyone around her

721
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:34,300
 had been given their mid-morning snack, a banana.

722
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,060
 I mean, just absolute nightmare territory.

723
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,620
 - Imagine, you're in a plane.

724
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,580
 - Banana's on a plane.

725
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,420
 - It's basically...

726
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,740
 - Yeah, motherfucking!

727
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,580
 (all laugh)

728
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:47,500
 - I was looking at kind of more common, uncommon phobias,

729
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,540
 and bananas was a surprising one.

730
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,980
 I didn't know that it was quite common

731
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,020
 among the uncommon phobias,

732
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,740
 but it does seem to be bananas,

733
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:58,100
 Psydonglobophobia, which is an intense fear of cotton balls,

734
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,460
 seems to be another one.

735
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,580
 - Psydonglobophobia.

736
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,660
 - That's surely more niche these days.

737
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,700
 - Cotton balls?

738
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,740
 - Are cotton balls still a big part of...

739
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,140
 - I use them every day.

740
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,620
 (all laugh)

741
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,620
 - Okay, grandma.

742
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,180
 (all laugh)

743
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:15,460
 - Actually, you know, Anna has an extremely common accent,

744
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,460
 but she puts them in her cheeks and it makes her speak this way.

745
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,940
 - Exactly.

746
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,660
 - I've got a lovely glass antique container next to the bath

747
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,500
 full of cotton balls.

748
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,140
 - It doesn't surprise me as a leaf.

749
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:25,980
 It doesn't surprise me.

750
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,540
 Are they useful for washing things?

751
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,820
 - Yeah, I actually do it to...

752
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,140
 - Makeup removal.

753
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:34,420
 - For women will be more I favor with cotton balls than men.

754
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,380
 - I mean, I have more makeup in the time that you've known me.

755
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,220
 - Okay.

756
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,060
 (all laugh)

757
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,540
 - It's washing food off a child's mouth.

758
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,380
 - Yeah.

759
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,220
 - Right, okay.

760
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,940
 - Cleaning very, very young babies' bums,

761
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,020
 you would use cotton balls.

762
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:45,860
 - Yes.

763
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,180
 - That's right.

764
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,620
 - Whenever you wear makeup,

765
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,660
 you basically continue to wear makeup

766
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,860
 for the next two weeks until it goes off.

767
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,260
 - Whenever we do a photo shoot every couple of years,

768
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,700
 I look more and more like I've got black eyes.

769
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,140
 (all laugh)

770
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,420
 But another one is balloons.

771
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,780
 I need some with a phobia of balloons.

772
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,620
 - Oh yeah.

773
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,460
 - And...

774
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,300
 - Oprah Winfrey.

775
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,140
 - Really?

776
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,340
 - Yeah, she's got a fear of balloons.

777
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:09,060
 The popping sound reminds her of a gunshot.

778
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,700
 So apparently balloons are not allowed near Oprah,

779
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,100
 in the same way bananas are not allowed near this Swedish...

780
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,060
 - Well, there was one guy who has a phobia of balloons

781
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,900
 who had to miss his brother's wedding

782
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,300
 'cause his brother had balloons at the wedding.

783
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,860
 And I just thought, as his brother,

784
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:26,180
 are you gonna insist on balloons at your wedding

785
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,420
 or let your brother come to your wedding?

786
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,380
 - Good point.

787
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,860
 I mean, balloons are not a big feature of a wedding

788
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,980
 unless both parties are nine years old

789
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,780
 and it's one of those European royal weddings.

790
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,900
 - They always get balloons at weddings.

791
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,300
 Every wedding that I've been to, I reckon.

792
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,540
 - Excuse me, James, you're at my wedding.

793
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:42,060
 I challenge you to spot a single balloon in there.

794
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,020
 (all laugh)

795
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,060
 - James brought me this over.

796
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,300
 - I floated in on a wicker chair.

797
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,900
 - Stop the wedding!

798
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:50,820
 (all laugh)

799
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,140
 It should have been me!

800
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,940
 - But would you, if the groom had said,

801
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,980
 "Listen, my brother has an extreme phobia of balloons

802
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:59,220
 "and can't come if you have the balloons,"

803
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,540
 would you have gone to the trouble

804
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,380
 of taking the balloons away?

805
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,460
 - That's such a good point.

806
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,620
 Dodgy phobias, I just love this,

807
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,700
 in 2014, a French government minister,

808
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:10,820
 he had failed to pay his income tax for three years

809
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:13,820
 and explained it was due to administrative phobia.

810
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,220
 (James laughs)

811
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,740
 - Which also meant he hadn't paid rent

812
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,980
 on his flat in Paris for three years

813
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,820
 and he also hadn't declared a company he owned.

814
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:21,660
 - You know what?

815
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,820
 I didn't read about that,

816
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:25,740
 but I did read about a man in Sweden

817
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,780
 who got a load of letters saying that he'd been speeding

818
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,580
 but had a phobia of brown envelopes.

819
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,740
 And he got off.

820
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,900
 He said, "I thought I hadn't got any warnings

821
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,660
 "because I hadn't read any of my things."

822
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:38,940
 - No, come on.

823
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,700
 - Well, and then I went onto the Oxford Dictionary

824
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,700
 of National Biography

825
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,700
 and looked if there was any weird phobias on there.

826
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,820
 And I found someone called Gina Fratini,

827
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:51,060
 who was a British fashion designer in the '70s.

828
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,020
 And she also had a brown envelope phobia,

829
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,060
 according to the ODMB.

830
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:54,900
 - Really?

831
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,660
 - So I think it is like this thing of,

832
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,660
 you know, you think it's gonna be bad news all the time.

833
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,500
 - Well, it is bad news.

834
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,340
 (both laugh)

835
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,180
 - It's the tax of writing.

836
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,020
 - You're so scared of it

837
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,380
 that you just won't open any of the envelopes.

838
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,220
 - Yeah.

839
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,500
 - I can kind of see what it comes from.

840
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,260
 - You knew they'd arrived, hadn't you?

841
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,020
 So you've seen that.

842
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,980
 What did you think was in the brown envelope?

843
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,740
 - Couple of other famous names who have phobias.

844
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,460
 Macaulay Culkin, after making "Home Alone",

845
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,660
 developed a phobia of leaving the house.

846
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,500
 - Really?

847
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,140
 - Yeah, he had agrophobia, and that was because

848
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:27,020
 his life absolutely changed the paparazzi

849
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,460
 everywhere, leaping out of bushes,

850
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,660
 sort of following him in cars.

851
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:32,100
 He got petrified, so he needed to stay at home.

852
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,740
 He needed to be away from everyone.

853
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,580
 - Pretty reasonable.

854
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:37,100
 - Nile Horan from One Direction, the band,

855
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,940
 petrified phobia of pigeons.

856
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,220
 And when they're on tour,

857
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:44,020
 they have people sweep the area for pigeons

858
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,900
 if he's going to a venue.

859
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,060
 - You would think he would just carry

860
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,540
 like a sparrow hawk with him wherever he went.

861
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,380
 - Or a duckstead.

862
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,540
 - A sparrow hawk's better.

863
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,020
 Sorry, that's more rock and roll.

864
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,620
 Much more rock and roll.

865
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,220
 I wasn't thinking about the optics.

866
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:01,420
 - On agrophobia, as you mentioned,

867
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:04,220
 I think that was the first ever modern recorded phobia,

868
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:07,780
 really, when psychologists started talking about phobias.

869
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:10,300
 And it was a guy called Westphal,

870
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,980
 who was a psychologist in the 1870s.

871
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,780
 But people were quite obsessed with it

872
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,980
 in the late 19th century.

873
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:17,820
 And Westphal described a patient who,

874
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,100
 it basically was a fear of anything

875
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,540
 that doesn't remind them of home.

876
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,940
 So he'd be out in a big square

877
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,380
 and he'd have to cling to the buildings

878
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,660
 on the way around 'cause that reminds you

879
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:28,100
 of being like surrounded by your awful walls.

880
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,980
 And then he said, to get home,

881
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:32,420
 if he has to get home and can't cling to the buildings,

882
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:35,140
 then he'll either follow someone very, very closely.

883
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,900
 So he's like, there's another human.

884
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,740
 Or he'll acquaint himself with a lady of the night

885
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:42,380
 and begin to talk to her until she realizes

886
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:44,500
 that he's not trying to get any custom.

887
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,260
 - Officer. (laughing)

888
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:51,260
 Let me assure you, this is all a simple misunderstanding.

889
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:53,780
 - Read Freud and he'll understand.

890
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,300
 - Would he go to walk him home?

891
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,700
 - He'd get a number of ladies of the night to walk him home.

892
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,980
 So he'd go with a chain of things.

893
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,980
 - Officer, officer.

894
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:02,980
 - Me again.

895
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:05,220
 - It's not an erotic conga, it's...

896
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,460
 (laughing)

897
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:15,180
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

898
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,460
 and that is Andy.

899
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,260
 My fact is that after Chernobyl,

900
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:21,380
 nearby children were treated for potential radiation sickness

901
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:24,260
 with compulsory hourly drinks of red wine.

902
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:26,860
 So, yeah. - Very nice, yeah.

903
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:29,540
 - This, I think, was sent in originally by Billy Vishen.

904
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,300
 So thank you, Billy.

905
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,620
 Chernobyl was in Soviet Union, now in Ukraine.

906
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:36,220
 It was a nuclear reactor, it fell over in 1986,

907
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,060
 had a big-- - Fell over.

908
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,340
 - Well, it didn't, you know what I mean.

909
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,700
 - It fell over. - It went badly wrong.

910
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,780
 - It went bang.

911
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,420
 - It went bang, it was a huge explosion,

912
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,700
 and in the wake of it, obviously, lots of radiation,

913
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,820
 which spread all the way across a big chunk of Europe.

914
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:49,980
 - Including the UK.

915
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,580
 - Including the UK.

916
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:55,700
 And in the local area, there was a belief

917
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,500
 that red wine was good for radiation sickness,

918
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,940
 and doctors recommended it.

919
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,660
 And there were numerous cases of children

920
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,420
 who were hospitalized, not because of radiation sickness,

921
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,660
 but because their parents have been giving them red wine

922
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,500
 on the hour every day.

923
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,740
 - It wasn't just around the areas

924
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,300
 in the whole of the Soviet Union.

925
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,140
 - Really, okay.

926
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:13,860
 - So I spoke to my in-laws who were there at the time.

927
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,260
 Apparently, it was common opinion

928
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:18,540
 that alcohol helped radiation poisoning.

929
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,060
 And they said that actually most people,

930
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,100
 as opposed to red wine,

931
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,260
 they would drink something called rectified spirit,

932
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:26,140
 which is 97.2% alcohol.

933
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:26,980
 - Oof, yeah.

934
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:29,580
 - You can't actually kind of get by getting normal vodka,

935
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,940
 and then distilling it, and distilling it,

936
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,020
 and distilling it until it's really, really strong.

937
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:33,940
 - Wow.

938
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:36,140
 - Well, the red wine connection was,

939
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,420
 there was a talk that went around at the time

940
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:42,020
 that Soviet submarine sailors would have wine

941
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,580
 with all of their dinner meals while they were down there,

942
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:47,020
 and the idea was to clean the system of radiation

943
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,380
 in the submarines.

944
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,740
 - Wait, so were they actually doing that?

945
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,060
 Oh, that was a rumor that they did that.

946
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,300
 - They were definitely, I saw a menu

947
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,180
 from a submarine, a Soviet submarine.

948
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,020
 - I'm sorry.

949
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:55,860
 - Incredible menu.

950
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:56,700
 - Really?

951
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,660
 - Yeah, I wasn't aware there were menus.

952
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,500
 - Yeah.

953
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,860
 - Okay, you're in it.

954
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,700
 - As you sit down.

955
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,980
 - Do you have anything a bit further away

956
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,140
 from the reactor, please?

957
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,900
 (all laughing)

958
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,740
 - I ought to be ill, but it escaped.

959
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,540
 (all laughing)

960
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,380
 - Wow.

961
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,260
 - Yeah, and you would have a ration of red wine

962
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,420
 for most dinner meals of most of the week.

963
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,860
 So, yeah, so rumor went around that.

964
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,980
 - And was that because of radiation?

965
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,980
 - Who knows, but that was what, yeah,

966
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:24,100
 according to people who lived in Chernobyl at the time,

967
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:24,940
 who recounted stories.

968
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:27,140
 - And of course, we now know that actually it does help.

969
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:30,540
 - Yes, bizarrely, it seems to have been a study,

970
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,260
 hasn't there, that sort of proved it.

971
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,100
 - Yeah, a bit.

972
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,700
 - A study from the University of Pittsburgh

973
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:38,220
 School of Medicine in 2008 found that something called

974
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:42,140
 resveratol, which is an antioxidant found in red wine,

975
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,580
 may offer protection against radiation.

976
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:48,500
 It helps cells, you got some cells in a Petri dish,

977
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,540
 then it helps them against radiation,

978
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:53,860
 but it didn't help mice when they tried it on mice.

979
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,620
 - Oh, I thought we did help some of the mice.

980
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:59,420
 - No, there was something called acetyl resveratol,

981
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:02,340
 which is like the previous thing that I tried to pronounce,

982
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,100
 but has got acetyl at the start of it,

983
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,140
 and that does help mice.

984
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:05,980
 - Right, okay.

985
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,860
 - But the thing that you get in red wine on its own,

986
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:08,700
 doesn't.

987
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,380
 - And also, as they said, it was a really funny thing

988
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:14,380
 to report because journalism is mad.

989
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:17,780
 Every headline, red wine can be,

990
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:19,940
 like the telegraph headline literally was,

991
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:22,460
 red wine can protect against radiation.

992
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,860
 Scientists may soon recommend that it is best you start

993
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,420
 drinking heavily if exposed.

994
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,140
 All of them saying it will protect you.

995
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,620
 - The scientist who did the study was very clear.

996
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:33,220
 He said that the dosage you would need to get enough

997
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,020
 to help you with any kind of radiation sickness

998
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,300
 would be 720 bottles of wine.

999
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,660
 - Yeah, right.

1000
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,220
 - It's pretty amazing, all the stuff that happened

1001
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:43,220
 just after Chernobyl had the moment

1002
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:47,020
 where everyone in the government was trying to downplay it

1003
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,220
 within the Soviet Union, trying to say,

1004
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,540
 "Oh, it's not as bad as it seems."

1005
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,780
 So I've read this amazing article

1006
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:54,740
 by a lady called Natalia Charakova,

1007
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,860
 who spoke about being there and what it was like

1008
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,780
 and all the things that were being done.

1009
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:01,340
 She was saying that experts were going up onto TV

1010
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,020
 just saying, "You know what, actually,

1011
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:05,060
 "small doses of radiation are really beneficial

1012
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,260
 "we found in rat health."

1013
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,740
 And so actually, this is--

1014
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:10,740
 - God, it's like the study for a white, wow.

1015
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,260
 - So it's not actually gonna be too bad for you.

1016
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,100
 - Like that happened in the US as well

1017
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:17,820
 after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

1018
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:21,500
 There were 132 news items in the New York Times

1019
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,460
 about the bombings and not a single one

1020
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,540
 mentioned anything about the radiation.

1021
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:28,940
 And there were 15 articles in the 10 months

1022
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:31,380
 after the blast that mentioned radiation at all,

1023
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,700
 and they all said there are some medical

1024
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,260
 and biological benefits to be gained from radiation.

1025
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,980
 And the other thing is Oppenheimer said,

1026
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,180
 "There is every reason to believe

1027
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,420
 "that there was no appreciable radio activity

1028
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,380
 "on the ground in Hiroshima."

1029
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,180
 So he was just like, "Oh, no, it's all fine."

1030
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,460
 "Yeah, no, we just blew them up."

1031
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:49,620
 - Gosh, at Chernobyl when it happened,

1032
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,660
 they flew over in helicopters,

1033
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:54,660
 they dropped 5,000 tons of sand and lead and clay

1034
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:57,180
 on top of the fire to snuff it out, basically,

1035
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,100
 to stop the rest of it.

1036
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,860
 'Cause only a small amount of the radioactive material

1037
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,820
 in Chernobyl actually was in this explosion.

1038
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:06,180
 And so the impetus was to put out that fire,

1039
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,740
 which they managed to do.

1040
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,300
 'Cause if the rest of it had gone up,

1041
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,420
 Europe might've become uninhabitable, basically.

1042
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,340
 - Yeah, wow.

1043
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,180
 - Yeah, and it worked.

1044
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,700
 I mean, what they, you know.

1045
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,540
 - It worked eventually, although I didn't realize

1046
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:19,020
 that the sound, the dumping in the first three days

1047
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:22,500
 was almost completely ineffectual, the sound and boron.

1048
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,460
 So they dumped lots of sand to try and put out the fires

1049
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:28,780
 and the boron was to counteract the radioactivity.

1050
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,860
 But I read the opening in the roof

1051
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:33,020
 where they were trying to get it was really small

1052
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:35,220
 and basically all the sand missed it at first.

1053
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,300
 And also when you dump sand,

1054
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,940
 you picture it going down in a big lump.

1055
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,380
 I hadn't thought about it, but when you dump sand,

1056
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,340
 it all like scatters out in the air

1057
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,700
 and sort of ends up floating down.

1058
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,020
 - They should've put more water in it.

1059
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:46,180
 - Should've made wet sand, didn't they?

1060
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,820
 - Oh, big hourglass.

1061
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:50,420
 I'm sorry to have some creative thinking here,

1062
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,340
 but you know, that funnels it, doesn't it?

1063
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,180
 - Yeah.

1064
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,420
 - Oh, you mean the top half of an hourglass?

1065
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,020
 - Yeah, I wouldn't have the whole hourglass.

1066
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,980
 - Yeah, it just goes up and down.

1067
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,980
 - Or gigantic sandcastle bucket

1068
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,860
 where you just lower the sand on top

1069
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,620
 and just build a lot of good solutions.

1070
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:06,340
 - The interesting thing about the hourglass

1071
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:08,900
 is you can have as big an hourglass as you want,

1072
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,100
 but the little funnel bit has to be the same size

1073
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,820
 'cause it has to be the size of a grain of sand.

1074
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:17,700
 So actually you're only gonna get a tiny trickle of sand.

1075
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:20,180
 - That's a good point, it will take a while.

1076
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:22,460
 - We're sitting in that helicopter day nine.

1077
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,660
 (both laughing)

1078
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,180
 Andy, are we sure about this?

1079
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:28,780
 - So then obviously you've got to cover this thing over.

1080
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,540
 So they built what they called a sarcophagus,

1081
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,340
 like this massive steel and concrete structure

1082
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:35,380
 to cover the reactor, what's left of the reactor.

1083
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,540
 And I find this amazing.

1084
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,740
 The crane operators who put that sarcophagus in place

1085
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:42,540
 did so without ever seeing what they were doing.

1086
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,380
 - What do you mean?

1087
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,220
 - Riddle me that.

1088
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,540
 - Okay.

1089
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,700
 - Okay, so they're in a crane

1090
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,260
 next to this thing that's happening.

1091
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,100
 - Yep.

1092
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,140
 - They would give them blindfolds

1093
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:54,820
 because they weren't allowed to know where it was

1094
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,260
 and they got led away.

1095
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,260
 - Any advance on that?

1096
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,140
 (both laughing)

1097
00:34:59,140 --> 00:34:59,980
 - Not bad, not bad.

1098
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:00,820
 - Sorry, I was thinking.

1099
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:01,660
 - Official secrecy.

1100
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:04,860
 - Yeah, 'cause like, who's grave was it?

1101
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,340
 Were they blindfolded everyone?

1102
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,980
 - I feel like it was Genghis Khan.

1103
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,500
 - Yeah, or Attila, yeah.

1104
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,820
 - Yeah.

1105
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,820
 - It was nighttime.

1106
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,900
 - Oh, that's good, that's good thinking.

1107
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,580
 - That's actually the, did they just use a pencil?

1108
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,420
 - Yeah.

1109
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,340
 - Oh, I was gonna do that one, yeah.

1110
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:21,580
 - What it was is they were inside lead lined cabins

1111
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,740
 because the radio activity when this was being lowered

1112
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,740
 was more well known about and it was very high.

1113
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:29,240
 So they were following instructions over the radio.

1114
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,660
 They were basically doing pin the sarcophagus

1115
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,500
 on the reactor.

1116
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,340
 - Wow.

1117
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,380
 - Like they were getting instructions

1118
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:36,020
 from people who were observing from a long distance.

1119
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:36,860
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1120
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:37,700
 - And they just were doing it blind.

1121
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,820
 - Left, left, no, mine left, no, mine left.

1122
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,740
 (both laughing)

1123
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,780
 - Okay, we're gonna need another sarcophagus now.

1124
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,580
 - Well, they did put a second one on in the end, didn't they?

1125
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,420
 - They did.

1126
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,540
 - In fact, this is something we talked about

1127
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,900
 on No. 6 Things in the News, our short-lived TV show.

1128
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,740
 - Oh yeah.

1129
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:51,580
 - Yeah.

1130
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,660
 - 'Cause I think it was around that time

1131
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:55,660
 when they put a new big bit of concrete over it

1132
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,220
 and it was like the biggest dome

1133
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,340
 that had ever been created.

1134
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,180
 - Is it concrete?

1135
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,780
 I thought it was, one of them was steel, right?

1136
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,220
 'Cause I felt like the first one was concrete

1137
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,540
 and that got dilapidated

1138
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,460
 and then they have now made this steel dome

1139
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:08,300
 which I think is gonna last 100 years-ish.

1140
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,940
 But it still feels like you're gonna have to set an alarm

1141
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,620
 for 100 years time when you've forgotten about it.

1142
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,940
 - It's just snoozing, isn't it, basically?

1143
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:13,940
 - Yeah.

1144
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,420
 - 'Cause it basically, it's Chernobyl turned into

1145
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,500
 basically a giant Russian doll.

1146
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,340
 - Oh.

1147
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,420
 - It's just bigger and bigger, yeah.

1148
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,220
 - Massive Ukrainian doll, we should say.

1149
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,460
 - Yeah, Ukrainian doll.

1150
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,780
 You can now, given that we're talking about alcohol

1151
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:28,740
 at Chernobyl, you can get a drink called Atomic

1152
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,940
 and I've ordered some of this, I love this.

1153
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:33,980
 It's harvested from apples from abandoned orchards

1154
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:36,580
 in the local area, all of which are now producing apples

1155
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:39,060
 which are very low in radiation.

1156
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,300
 So it's completely safe for consumption

1157
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,580
 and it goes to funding local bits of Ukraine

1158
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:45,700
 which have been, you know, severely hammered

1159
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,740
 not only by the nuclear reactor going off,

1160
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,580
 but also by the war.

1161
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:51,140
 And it's still being made and distributed, I believe, so.

1162
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:51,980
 - That's good, I know.

1163
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:54,180
 - I think it's you don't drink vodka, so.

1164
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,140
 - I'm gonna try.

1165
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:55,980
 - But good on you.

1166
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:56,820
 - I'm gonna have a bag of apples,

1167
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,980
 it might be more like snaps.

1168
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,860
 - It's exactly, I think it is actually.

1169
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:00,980
 I think it's basically snaps.

1170
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,140
 - Is it an apple sour?

1171
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,500
 - Yeah, it's an apple very sour, yeah.

1172
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,260
 - It's amazing the fallout, how far it did travel.

1173
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,540
 Like they have found a little layer

1174
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:12,140
 of radioactive materials at the bottom of Loch Ness,

1175
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,540
 for example, which has come.

1176
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,380
 - Here we go.

1177
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:15,220
 - Hey, listen, I can't.

1178
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,540
 - Did the Beatles find it?

1179
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,380
 My only chance.

1180
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:22,780
 - They were in a yellow submarine on the menu each night.

1181
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:25,820
 - But no, do you know what's interesting?

1182
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,780
 Talking earlier about the sort of the experts

1183
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,020
 coming on and trying to downplay it.

1184
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:32,700
 As a result, people sort of started thinking,

1185
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,140
 actually, this might not be true.

1186
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,660
 And according to Natalia,

1187
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,220
 whose article I read about the experience

1188
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,260
 of living there at the time,

1189
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:41,380
 she said everyone started experiencing radiophobia,

1190
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,980
 like her grandmother used to put iodine in her meals

1191
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:46,420
 just to make sure that, yeah.

1192
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:48,340
 Then also parents were just,

1193
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,700
 if they couldn't get out from where they were,

1194
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,700
 we're just putting their kids onto trains

1195
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:54,300
 with their names, and this is my name,

1196
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,260
 please look after me and just saying, go.

1197
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,940
 And they sent them out in further away,

1198
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:58,780
 in further away.

1199
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,020
 - 'Cause these weren't people in the exclusion zone,

1200
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:02,500
 'cause the exclusion zone was completely evacuated.

1201
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,580
 But people who were just close enough

1202
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,100
 that they thought, I'm really scared now.

1203
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,060
 - Yeah, it just spread around there.

1204
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,380
 Like how far did this travel?

1205
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,980
 - A lot of people in the UK were scared as well.

1206
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,820
 It's in all the newspapers.

1207
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:12,260
 I probably would have been quite scared, yeah.

1208
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,740
 - I got one of the letters that was sent out

1209
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,900
 to people living in the local area at the time.

1210
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:16,940
 It's really interesting the phrasing,

1211
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,740
 'cause they're trying to persuade people

1212
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:19,620
 to take some precautions,

1213
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:21,340
 but also trying to say, it's all fine.

1214
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:24,820
 So the letter begins, dear comrades, positive.

1215
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:26,260
 The result of detailed analysis showed

1216
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,620
 that living and working in your village

1217
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,980
 will cause no harm to adults or children.

1218
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:30,820
 Great news.

1219
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,540
 And then it said, we've got a few tips.

1220
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:35,620
 Do not eat berries and mushrooms gathered this year.

1221
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,340
 Children should not enter the forest.

1222
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,380
 Limit fresh greens.

1223
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,820
 Remove topsoil from the garden

1224
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,380
 and bury it in specially prepared graves

1225
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,660
 far from the village.

1226
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:43,500
 But apart from that, you're all fine.

1227
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,660
 - I think mushrooms like are particularly bad, aren't they?

1228
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:48,580
 'Cause they sort of get the nutrients from the soil

1229
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,980
 and they can't really.

1230
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:50,820
 - Now.

1231
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:51,660
 - Is that not true?

1232
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,260
 - Is this where your mushroom thing comes from?

1233
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,900
 - Oh, maybe.

1234
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,420
 - You look at a mushroom and you see radiation.

1235
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,540
 You were alive at the time.

1236
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,380
 It was in the news.

1237
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:00,220
 - It's true, it's true.

1238
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,980
 - There might have been a triggering incident.

1239
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:02,820
 - Could have been.

1240
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,100
 That's usually the case, isn't it?

1241
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:04,940
 That's what they all say,

1242
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,540
 that these people who are scared of bananas

1243
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,780
 must have had some terrible bananas.

1244
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,620
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1245
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,780
 - There was a woman who was electrocuted

1246
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:13,220
 while looking at a bowl of bananas.

1247
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,060
 Sorry, it's not funny.

1248
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:14,900
 It's not funny.

1249
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:15,740
 - No.

1250
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:16,820
 - Like, got an electric shock.

1251
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:17,660
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1252
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:18,500
 - Electrocuted.

1253
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,340
 - Electrified.

1254
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,180
 - Well, she wasn't,

1255
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,860
 she didn't convert to run on electricity.

1256
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,780
 (laughing)

1257
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,580
 It's a word we haven't worked out yet.

1258
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:26,860
 - Have you guys heard about this?

1259
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:27,900
 Many things about this.

1260
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,860
 Samosally, they're the people who chose to return.

1261
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:33,820
 So about 1,200 people, after they're evacuated,

1262
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:34,780
 decided, you know what?

1263
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,660
 My home's Chernobyl or the surrounding area.

1264
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,500
 I'm going back.

1265
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,220
 And they went back and a couple of years that followed.

1266
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,900
 - Wow, like two, three years after.

1267
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,780
 - Like some of them went back months after.

1268
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:45,620
 A lot of them did.

1269
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:47,020
 And there are about 200 of them left.

1270
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,140
 And it's fascinating

1271
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:51,100
 'cause they're spread across about 164 villages.

1272
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:54,020
 So there were just over one person per village.

1273
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:56,340
 And they live extraordinary lives.

1274
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,460
 I was reading an interview with one called Ivan

1275
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,500
 who was remembering the time

1276
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,220
 and said that, you know, they weren't really scared.

1277
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:03,740
 He remembered going and handing alcohol

1278
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:06,180
 to everyone there 'cause they all knew it would cure them.

1279
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:08,940
 And he lives in a village with two other women.

1280
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,780
 The journalist said, do you ever see them?

1281
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,260
 And he said, no, we almost never socialize.

1282
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:14,740
 - I'm really sorry to say this, but sitcom?

1283
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:19,020
 I know I say it all the time

1284
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,380
 when something like this terrible thing happens.

1285
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,340
 - But you think this is the one?

1286
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:23,820
 - I mean, one guy and two women

1287
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,140
 living in a village on the road

1288
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:27,460
 and they never like to speak to each other.

1289
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:30,340
 - It's a recipe for comedy.

1290
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:34,100
 - Did you see Bionerd, 23?

1291
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:34,940
 - What's that?

1292
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:37,220
 - She's someone who had a YouTube channel

1293
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:39,100
 and she made over 60 videos of her

1294
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,500
 going in the exclusion zone.

1295
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,060
 And she would do things like pick apples off a tree

1296
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,460
 and take a bite into them.

1297
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:45,660
 But she was also a scientist.

1298
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,260
 And so she would show you that it was safe.

1299
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:50,380
 But she hasn't posted, I think, in about five years now.

1300
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,540
 And she never gave her name

1301
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,380
 and no one really knows who she is.

1302
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,820
 So we don't know what's happened to her.

1303
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:58,020
 But she's a legit sort of YouTuber from back in the day.

1304
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,620
 - A legit YouTuber, what is a legit YouTuber?

1305
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,660
 - Well, she was a scientist

1306
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:03,140
 who was trying to show you that it's changed.

1307
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:03,980
 - Yeah, legit.

1308
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,300
 - 'Cause a legit YouTuber is just someone

1309
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,900
 who has a camera on their phone.

1310
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:07,740
 - There it is, yeah.

1311
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:08,980
 - So everyone apart from you.

1312
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:11,140
 (all laughing)

1313
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:13,860
 There are a lot of dogs around Chernobyl today.

1314
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:17,220
 And they're genetically distinct from dogs

1315
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,620
 that are just about 10 or 20 miles away.

1316
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:21,020
 - Is that just they've mated with each other?

1317
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:21,980
 They've got their own clan.

1318
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,100
 And so they've become a little different.

1319
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:23,940
 - It honestly is that.

1320
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,460
 It's just they've kept themselves to themselves.

1321
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:29,020
 And the other dogs have kept themselves to themselves.

1322
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,780
 And they've lived apart for long enough

1323
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,100
 that they have genetic markers

1324
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,580
 that are different between the two dogs now.

1325
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:34,420
 - Do they?

1326
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,260
 - Wow, that's incredible.

1327
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,100
 - That's interesting.

1328
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:38,500
 'Cause they're basically survivors of the cull, aren't they?

1329
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,980
 When one of the less,

1330
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,900
 well, all the jobs are quite unpleasant after it,

1331
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,700
 but a specific police squad were sent in

1332
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:46,060
 to kill all the pets that were left in Chernobyl

1333
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:48,460
 so that they didn't go and spread.

1334
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:50,980
 - The idea is perhaps there was something about them

1335
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:53,500
 that made them able to survive the cull.

1336
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,740
 And that's like a slightly genetic difference

1337
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,420
 that has them, you know.

1338
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,260
 - Wow.

1339
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:01,860
 - The ability to hide under a sofa.

1340
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:02,700
 - But that's the same.

1341
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:05,740
 All the frogs around there are now black.

1342
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:06,580
 And this is very weird.

1343
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:08,420
 It's 'cause initially slightly darker frogs

1344
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:10,780
 were slightly likely to survive the radiation.

1345
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:13,060
 And this is how long ago, nearly 40 years now,

1346
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:15,420
 which is 10 to 15 frog generations.

1347
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:18,020
 So they have observed micro evolution even in this time.

1348
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:20,500
 And darker ones in the exclusion zone,

1349
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,340
 the frogs are all black now.

1350
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:25,300
 - I've read recently that gray squirrels are turning black.

1351
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,140
 - Is that so?

1352
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:27,340
 - We've got black squirrels around us.

1353
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:28,940
 And I always wonder what the hell they're doing there.

1354
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:31,860
 - Well, apparently they are more likely to survive

1355
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:35,060
 if they're dark because it means they can hide.

1356
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:36,980
 - I don't know what they blend in with.

1357
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,100
 - That's a bit depressing, isn't it?

1358
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,540
 - I read that in a study this week.

1359
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:41,580
 So actually, I just read the headline.

1360
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:43,540
 I haven't read the study yet.

1361
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:44,980
 - The hang on concrete is gray.

1362
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:46,420
 I would have thought gray squirrel or gray concrete

1363
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:47,940
 is perfect for them.

1364
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,940
 - And then you'll come, you get run over.

1365
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:52,300
 Black squirrel used to stand out.

1366
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,940
 - And is that why, do they want to stand out?

1367
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:55,580
 - I really wish I'd read this article now.

1368
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:57,620
 - No, it feels like it would have helped us a lot.

1369
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:58,460
 - That's just what you're like wildly,

1370
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:00,500
 it's what Dan's all the podcast is.

1371
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:03,080
 (upbeat music)

1372
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:08,580
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show.

1373
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:09,740
 And that is my fact.

1374
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:13,900
 My fact this week is that the song "Take Me Home Country Roads"

1375
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:16,380
 was written by three people who had never been

1376
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:17,900
 to West Virginia.

1377
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:20,940
 Take Me Out to the Ball Game was written by two people

1378
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:23,420
 who had never been to a ball game.

1379
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:26,060
 And the Pina Collada song was written by one person

1380
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,260
 who had never drunk one.

1381
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:28,100
 - Lovely.

1382
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,260
 - A lot of this makes sense.

1383
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:31,340
 I mean, the reason you want to be taken to a ball game

1384
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:32,980
 'cause you've never been to one.

1385
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:33,820
 - Oh, that's true.

1386
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:34,660
 - That holds together, doesn't it?

1387
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:36,740
 - But on the other hand, "Take Me Home"

1388
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:38,820
 to West Virginia. - Doesn't play, yeah.

1389
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:40,180
 - That's tougher.

1390
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:42,060
 - So that famously is a John Denver song written

1391
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:46,420
 by three people, Bill Danoff, Taffy Nivert and John Denver.

1392
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:48,740
 The first two were in a band before

1393
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:51,380
 and Danoff wrote that song "Afternoon Delight",

1394
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:52,220
 if you know that.

1395
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:53,740
 - My rock is in flight.

1396
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:54,580
 - Yeah, exactly.

1397
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:57,620
 If you've seen "Anchorman", you'll know that movie.

1398
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:58,820
 Sorry, you'll know that song.

1399
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:01,460
 But yeah, so they were riding around in their car

1400
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:04,140
 on Clopper Road in Montgomery County, Maryland.

1401
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:06,820
 And they had an idea for this song.

1402
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:07,660
 But it didn't scan.

1403
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:09,740
 - "Take Me Home", Clopper Road.

1404
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:11,580
 (all laughing)

1405
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:12,420
 - Yeah, it didn't scan.

1406
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:14,500
 And they were writing the lyrics one night

1407
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:17,220
 and John Denver happened to come over to their house

1408
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:18,660
 having busted his thumb

1409
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:20,780
 and gone to emergency hospital surgery.

1410
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:23,140
 He was sitting with them in their house early in the morning.

1411
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:25,060
 They'd planned to sell it to Johnny Cash.

1412
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:26,700
 And he started hearing the song.

1413
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:27,740
 He thought, "This is incredible."

1414
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:29,660
 And they stayed up all night writing the song.

1415
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:31,780
 And because none of them had been to West Virginia,

1416
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:33,380
 they got an encyclopedia down

1417
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:34,940
 and they had to look up all the details

1418
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:37,060
 in order to make the lyrics work.

1419
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:37,900
 - Is the rest of the song,

1420
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:40,140
 does it show an encyclopedic knowledge of West Virginia?

1421
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:40,980
 'Cause I've come over.

1422
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:43,900
 - Full violation, 384,000.

1423
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:46,540
 (all laughing)

1424
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:51,220
 - I heard that they basically liked the scanning

1425
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:54,020
 of Blue Ridge Mountains and Shenador River

1426
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:54,860
 and stuff like that.

1427
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:56,780
 They like these phrases.

1428
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:59,100
 And that's kind of why they went for West Virginia.

1429
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,420
 - 'Cause those are the famous bits.

1430
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:01,940
 If you just do the main population centers,

1431
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:03,620
 it's probably gonna be less romantic.

1432
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:06,140
 - Yeah, but also they were gonna use Massachusetts

1433
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:08,340
 'cause it's got four syllables as well.

1434
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:10,060
 Just looking for something with four syllables in it.

1435
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:12,700
 - Right, West Virginia, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1436
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:14,060
 What about this ball game thing?

1437
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:15,180
 - Oh, the ball game?

1438
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:18,100
 - Well, ball game, that was written in 1908

1439
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:20,220
 and that was written by a guy called Jack Norworth

1440
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:23,100
 and he wrote the lyrics and he brought the song,

1441
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:25,540
 the lyrics to this guy called Albert von Tilzer

1442
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:27,980
 and he put it to the tune that we now know it as.

1443
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:30,540
 Both of them had never been to a game before.

1444
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:33,140
 They would only go one of them 32 years later

1445
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:36,060
 after writing the song and then the other 20 years later

1446
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:38,300
 after writing the song, but it became popular

1447
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:40,060
 because it was an incredible announcer

1448
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:42,060
 for the Chicago White Sox.

1449
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:44,500
 He would announce their games called Harry Carrie.

1450
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:46,780
 Who used to sing it?

1451
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:47,940
 - We should just say that this is,

1452
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:49,820
 if you go to a baseball game,

1453
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:51,500
 they play it at every baseball game in America.

1454
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,220
 So that's why it's kind of famous.

1455
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:55,060
 - It's massive and they play it at the same point

1456
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:56,700
 as well as during the Seventh Innings.

1457
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:58,060
 - I don't think I know it.

1458
00:45:58,060 --> 00:45:59,400
 Is it like the equivalent of like--

1459
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,100
 - I like thinking British people wouldn't know it.

1460
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:01,940
 - I don't know.

1461
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:04,460
 ♪ Take me out to the ball game ♪

1462
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:05,700
 - Wow, really?

1463
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:06,780
 - British people would not know that song.

1464
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:08,900
 - It's just in so many American movies and--

1465
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,500
 - Is it the equivalent of the rare,

1466
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,060
 the referee, the wanker?

1467
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:12,900
 - That's it, yeah.

1468
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,420
 - It was their follow-up, it's just--

1469
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:15,940
 - That was actually written by a man

1470
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,260
 who had never masturbated.

1471
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:19,500
 (all laughing)

1472
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,140
 - A lot of people look back on this song now

1473
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:23,220
 because most people don't know the lyrics to the song,

1474
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:24,260
 certainly the first verse.

1475
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:25,340
 They just know "Take me out."

1476
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:27,300
 They know the main chorus, which is sung.

1477
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:29,980
 But it's pushed as a really progressive song

1478
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:30,900
 for women at the time.

1479
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:33,100
 And this was a result of he based it on,

1480
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:35,460
 he was having an affair at the time

1481
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:36,940
 with two vaudeville characters.

1482
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:41,060
 - His main girlfriend was someone called Trixie Fraganza,

1483
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:42,220
 who's also a bit--

1484
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:44,460
 - Sorry, Trixie, but not a real name.

1485
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:47,580
 - Before you say so, she was an outspoken suffragist

1486
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:49,020
 as well as a vaudeville.

1487
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:50,340
 - No good honest, incredible.

1488
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:51,900
 - Sounds like a suffragist's name,

1489
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:53,980
 doesn't it, Trixie Fraganza?

1490
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:57,580
 But she had, her most famous act was striptease,

1491
00:46:57,580 --> 00:47:00,180
 where every time it looked like she was gonna take off

1492
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:02,020
 an item of clothing, she did,

1493
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:02,940
 but you never saw anything

1494
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:05,220
 'cause there was always more clothing underneath.

1495
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:06,060
 She would just keep going,

1496
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:07,660
 and there'd be more and more and more clothes.

1497
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:10,100
 - She's covered in layers of suffragist pamphlets.

1498
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:10,940
 - Yes.

1499
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:13,380
 - But it's pushed as a really progressive song

1500
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:14,300
 for women at the time.

1501
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:16,980
 And this was a result of him basing it on Trixie.

1502
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:20,180
 So the lyrics basically say she was baseball mad.

1503
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:21,580
 This was a time, 1908,

1504
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:23,100
 where women weren't going to baseball,

1505
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:24,940
 and it was, so it was a real push.

1506
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:25,980
 - Cool. - It was good.

1507
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:27,300
 - Go Trixie. - Aggressive.

1508
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:28,420
 - I won't hear a word against her.

1509
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:29,420
 - Okay, what was the last one?

1510
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:31,620
 - Oh, Pina Colada. - Pina Colada.

1511
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:32,540
 - Yeah, I love this.

1512
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:33,980
 - Yeah, well, do you wanna take over, Andy?

1513
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:38,380
 - Well, so Rupert Holmes from Northwich in Cheshire?

1514
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:39,340
 - Really? - Yeah.

1515
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:40,340
 - Who wrote the Pina Colada song?

1516
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:42,380
 - He wrote the Pina Colada song, Northwich.

1517
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:43,660
 - Lovely part of the world.

1518
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:44,980
 - Is it? I've never been.

1519
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:45,820
 - No.

1520
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:48,060
 - Well, it now has a Pina Colada festival every year.

1521
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:49,260
 - It does.

1522
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:50,700
 - And he had never had one.

1523
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,780
 And also it wasn't meant to be Pina Colada in the song.

1524
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:56,780
 Initially when he was writing it, it was Humphrey Bogart.

1525
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:57,780
 - Yeah.

1526
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:59,700
 - If you like Humphrey Bogart.

1527
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:02,220
 - If you like Humphrey Bogart.

1528
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:04,180
 - Yeah, you would have to say Humphrey Bogart.

1529
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:05,180
 - No, I think you can go,

1530
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:07,180
 if you like Humphrey Bogart.

1531
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:11,100
 - No, guys, if you like Humphrey Bogart, that's easy.

1532
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:13,660
 - If you like Humphrey Bogart.

1533
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:15,660
 - But so yeah, he just thought,

1534
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:17,140
 what is a nice sounding drink?

1535
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:18,500
 He had never had it.

1536
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,020
 And the sales were terrible of the song at first,

1537
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:22,940
 despite the song being mega popular.

1538
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:24,420
 So it's a great, it's a brilliant song.

1539
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:27,460
 It's about this guy who's bored of his lady.

1540
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:28,780
 And he posts--

1541
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,700
 - Are you gonna spoil a Pina Colada song now?

1542
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,540
 - I think I am actually.

1543
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:33,580
 He reads an advert in the newspaper.

1544
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:34,980
 - If you're halfway through listening

1545
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:38,540
 to the Pina Colada song, just turn off now.

1546
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,060
 - He reads this advert in the newspaper saying,

1547
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:42,980
 if you like Pina Colada and getting caught in the rain,

1548
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:45,100
 if you blah, blah, blah, blah, then, you know,

1549
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:46,100
 let's get together.

1550
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:49,380
 And then he turns up and it's his wife.

1551
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:51,780
 They realize they did love each other.

1552
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:54,420
 They are compatible, but anyway, whatever.

1553
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:55,260
 - What a lovely story.

1554
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:56,820
 - And the thing is, come with me and escape.

1555
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:58,540
 And the song is called Escape.

1556
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:00,020
 And everyone was listening on the radio.

1557
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,780
 The radio fans were going nuts for it.

1558
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:03,260
 DJs were playing it all the time,

1559
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:05,060
 but no one was buying it 'cause they could not remember

1560
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:06,380
 the name of the song.

1561
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:07,220
 - Oh my God.

1562
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:08,060
 - It was what's that song?

1563
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:09,500
 It's the, oh, you know, the Pina Colada song.

1564
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:10,340
 And then his record label--

1565
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:11,780
 - How helpful were shopkeepers in those days?

1566
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:14,620
 If you went in and said, what's the song about Pina Colada?

1567
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:15,940
 And they're like, what's the seal?

1568
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:17,660
 - Nope, nope, never heard of that.

1569
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:18,660
 Nope.

1570
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:20,300
 - And his record label put,

1571
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:24,700
 his record label put on escape brackets of the Pina Colada song.

1572
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:26,500
 - I just love the idea of him saying,

1573
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,580
 unless you say the exact correct name,

1574
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:29,580
 I'm not gonna get it.

1575
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:31,380
 - A lot of record shots were starved

1576
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:33,180
 by Rumpelstiltskin in those days.

1577
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:35,340
 (both laughing)

1578
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:36,820
 But the record label added those brackets,

1579
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:38,740
 literally escape brackets, the Pina Colada song,

1580
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:40,380
 and it went quadruple platinum.

1581
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:42,780
 - Really? - It just went nuts, yeah, yeah.

1582
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:46,940
 - On sort of songs that don't fit their writers,

1583
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:49,180
 which I suppose is the topic of this,

1584
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:50,380
 a hard one to research.

1585
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:53,380
 But the famous one really is the Barry Manilow song,

1586
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:56,020
 I Write the Songs, which he didn't write.

1587
00:49:56,020 --> 00:50:00,140
 It was actually written by Bruce Johnson of The Beach Boys.

1588
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:02,340
 - Wow. - Which I hadn't realized.

1589
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:03,980
 And Manilow did say at the time

1590
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:05,340
 that he knew that he would be in trouble

1591
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:06,900
 as soon as his producer handed it to him.

1592
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,780
 And he said, look, I know that I'm gonna get in shit

1593
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:10,460
 for this 'cause I didn't write it.

1594
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:12,540
 But have you ever heard the Barry Manilow song?

1595
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:13,900
 I really do write the songs.

1596
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:14,740
 - No. (both laughing)

1597
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:17,140
 - It's really good. - I love a song sequel.

1598
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:19,380
 - It's so good, so it's a spoof,

1599
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:21,340
 basically responding to all his critics who were saying,

1600
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:23,100
 but he didn't write, I write the songs.

1601
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:26,100
 And it's a manual for how to write a song.

1602
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:29,340
 So it has lyrics like, you start off with the verse,

1603
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:30,540
 and that's the part that tells you

1604
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:32,420
 what the song's gonna be about.

1605
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:34,260
 And you can talk about dope or death,

1606
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:36,020
 but love is probably the best.

1607
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:37,580
 It's better than this, the actual lyrics.

1608
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:38,700
 - It does sound like they have used

1609
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,700
 an encyclopedia entry for that one.

1610
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:42,540
 (both laughing)

1611
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:44,220
 - You know the thing with I Write the Songs?

1612
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:46,100
 He didn't want to sing it

1613
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:48,900
 because he wanted to write his own songs.

1614
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:52,740
 And he was presented with it by his producer.

1615
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:55,860
 And it's the singer of the song is the spirit of music.

1616
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:58,100
 It's actually from the perspective of music itself.

1617
00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:59,420
 I write the songs, right?

1618
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:01,820
 Like I'm the inspiration for the channel.

1619
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:03,140
 But when he read the lyrics, he thought,

1620
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:04,940
 this just sounds like me, Barry Manilow,

1621
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:06,300
 singing I write the songs.

1622
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:07,540
 And that's what people interpret it as.

1623
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:08,980
 So I don't want to do that.

1624
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:12,380
 And Bruce Johnson said, no, this is God narrating the song.

1625
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:14,380
 - And it's gonna come off as much better

1626
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:15,220
 if you're speaking as God.

1627
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:17,220
 - Yeah, he really didn't want to sing it

1628
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:19,020
 until he was strong armed into it by his producer.

1629
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:20,340
 And then went to number one.

1630
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:22,220
 - I think he quite enjoyed it.

1631
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:24,740
 As in, I think now, like doing that piss take

1632
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:25,940
 that ends in the climax.

1633
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:27,460
 Sometimes I really do write the songs.

1634
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:28,580
 And he does refer to it.

1635
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:29,820
 I feel like he's taken it quite well.

1636
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:32,100
 You could have got quite pissed off about that tension.

1637
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:34,140
 I'm not like Frank Sinatra actually did a version,

1638
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:35,380
 which I didn't know.

1639
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:36,780
 And he insisted on changing the lyrics

1640
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:39,860
 to I sing the songs, which I think is a bit of a cop out.

1641
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:40,700
 - Yeah, it is.

1642
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:43,460
 - Do you guys know the song Girls Just Wanna Have Fun?

1643
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:44,660
 - Of course. - Love it.

1644
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:45,580
 Cindy Lauper.

1645
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:47,540
 - Well, she didn't write it.

1646
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:50,300
 It was written by a man called Robert Hazard.

1647
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:54,300
 And the amazing thing is not only did he write it,

1648
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:55,940
 he also sang it.

1649
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:57,940
 And he sang the same lyrics more or less.

1650
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:00,100
 It's slightly different, but they're more or less the same.

1651
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:02,780
 But when you listen to them, how he sang them,

1652
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:04,620
 it's got a really different meaning.

1653
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:05,460
 - I bet.

1654
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:07,580
 - So if you think about it, my daddy said,

1655
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:09,300
 "What are you gonna do with your life?

1656
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:10,620
 "You're not the fortunate one.

1657
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:11,820
 "Girls just wanna have fun."

1658
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:13,300
 What he's saying is,

1659
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:15,300
 "I'm not gonna care what I'm doing in my life.

1660
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,620
 "I'm going out and I'm gonna sleep with a load of women

1661
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:19,500
 "because they just wanna have fun."

1662
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,940
 - Fair enough.

1663
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:22,780
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1664
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:23,620
 But it's a different song.

1665
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:24,460
 - It's a very different song.

1666
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:25,420
 - It's a different tone, isn't it?

1667
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:26,700
 - Yeah, yeah, definitely.

1668
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:27,900
 - I think "I'm Every Woman"

1669
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:29,980
 was also largely written by a man.

1670
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:30,820
 - Was it?

1671
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:31,940
 - Yeah, yeah.

1672
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:33,060
 - What do you mean largely written?

1673
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:35,020
 Like, he wrote "I'm Every Man."

1674
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:36,500
 Someone had to do the WO.

1675
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:37,420
 - I think it was co-written,

1676
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:38,620
 but he wrote most of the lyrics.

1677
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:39,460
 - Oh, really?

1678
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:40,300
 - Yeah, yeah.

1679
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:43,680
 - I do know that respect R-E-S-P-E-C-T.

1680
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,580
 Indeed, Ari Frankes,

1681
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:48,980
 which was a big feminist anthem, obviously,

1682
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:50,460
 and a civil rights anthem.

1683
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:53,580
 But that was originally written about a man

1684
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:55,500
 saying, "My wife's got to respect me

1685
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:58,900
 when I come home tired from work after a long, old day."

1686
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:00,740
 And yeah.

1687
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:01,580
 - Oh, wow.

1688
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:02,420
 - She just reclaimed it.

1689
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:04,220
 - One little tweak, yeah, yeah.

1690
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:05,180
 - Yeah.

1691
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:06,700
 - My favorite one's always been that

1692
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:08,620
 the song "It Wasn't Me" by Shaggy.

1693
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:10,260
 15 years after the song was released,

1694
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:12,260
 he revealed that it was in fact him.

1695
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:14,140
 He was the cheater in the song.

1696
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:15,540
 - 'Cause it's about someone cheating.

1697
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:16,380
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1698
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:19,260
 It's actually used legally now as the Shaggy defense.

1699
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:21,500
 - It's where you got irrefutable evidence

1700
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:22,620
 that you did something and you just say,

1701
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:23,460
 "No, I didn't do it."

1702
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:24,620
 - Exactly, yeah.

1703
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:25,460
 The Shaggy defense.

1704
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:26,300
 - The toddler defense.

1705
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:27,140
 - It's a bad defense.

1706
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:28,140
 - It's a Trump defense.

1707
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:28,980
 - Look at this, yeah.

1708
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:31,260
 - Toto, you can guess what I'm about to say about them.

1709
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:32,460
 - Africa, they've never been to Africa.

1710
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:34,940
 - Yeah, and this is David Page, who wrote,

1711
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:36,740
 I was reading about, I basically thought,

1712
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:38,500
 "I bet Toto had never been to Africa."

1713
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:42,180
 And I looked at Africa and they hadn't when they wrote it.

1714
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:44,620
 And the guy who wrote it was a member of the band

1715
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:45,460
 called David Page.

1716
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:47,660
 And he sounds quite arrogant.

1717
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:49,940
 He said he was humming the melody

1718
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:51,540
 and then the words came to him

1719
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:52,740
 and he thought to himself,

1720
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:55,260
 "Hang on, I'm a very talented songwriter,

1721
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:57,220
 "but even I'm not this talented,

1722
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:59,860
 "our higher power is writing through me."

1723
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:01,180
 - That God again.

1724
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:03,100
 - That bloody God he gets everywhere.

1725
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:05,380
 And he used descriptions that he'd read

1726
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:06,420
 in National Geographic.

1727
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:09,220
 And I think he'd read a biography of Dr. Livingston

1728
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:10,940
 to get his Africa...

1729
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:15,500
 - Okay, we'll just bang up to the minute

1730
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:17,900
 for the very latest news out of the continent.

1731
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:19,820
 - He'd basically been, I think we can say.

1732
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:21,260
 - Are there any brilliant Congress lyrics in the song?

1733
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:22,460
 I can't remember how it goes.

1734
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:23,780
 - There are a few.

1735
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:25,420
 - I hear the reins down in Africa, is that it?

1736
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:26,260
 - Yeah.

1737
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:27,900
 - The Serengeti is in the wrong place.

1738
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:29,300
 I can't remember what the lyric is.

1739
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:30,340
 Like something rises over,

1740
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:31,540
 a mountain rises over the Serengeti.

1741
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:33,980
 Kill the manjaro over the Serengeti, I think.

1742
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:34,820
 Which isn't...

1743
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:35,980
 - It's not too far away, isn't it?

1744
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:38,300
 - It's not too far away.

1745
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:39,540
 - Close enough.

1746
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:40,580
 It's all Africa.

1747
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:41,780
 Yeah, okay, got it.

1748
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:44,100
 - He didn't admit that he hadn't been.

1749
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:46,340
 And then he went in the late 1990s.

1750
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:47,540
 So he wrote it in 1982.

1751
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:49,260
 Then they toured in South Africa.

1752
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:51,860
 And apparently he said when he was touring South Africa,

1753
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:54,420
 all the South Africans ran up to him and said,

1754
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:56,060
 "Wow, so when were you in Africa?"

1755
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:58,020
 And when he said he wasn't, they said,

1756
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:00,620
 "But you described it so perfectly."

1757
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:03,180
 - The way that the pyramids reflect the beauties

1758
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:05,100
 of Johannesburg, it's incredible.

1759
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:07,780
 - The other toto.

1760
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:09,540
 Sorry, I've just got one more thing about the other toto.

1761
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:10,380
 - Yeah?

1762
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:11,220
 - The toto of the dog.

1763
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:12,700
 Wizard of Oz.

1764
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:13,700
 What's the famous song?

1765
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:15,100
 - We're off to see the wizard.

1766
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:15,940
 - Oh, sorry.

1767
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:17,260
 - Somewhere over the rainbow.

1768
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:20,740
 - Oh my God, the author had never seen a rainbow.

1769
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:21,980
 - I shouldn't have picked a film

1770
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:24,580
 which is banger after banger after banger.

1771
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:26,140
 Somewhere over the rainbow is the song I'm thinking of.

1772
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:27,860
 There were concerns about that song.

1773
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:29,380
 Can you guess why?

1774
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:32,820
 So it's an ecosystem based on selling sheet music.

1775
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:35,620
 Studio executives were very nervous about this song.

1776
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:36,460
 - Is it 'cause it's a set?

1777
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:37,860
 It's very short.

1778
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:40,220
 - It's because of the way the notes muck around.

1779
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:41,740
 There's an octave leap.

1780
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:43,060
 Somewhere.

1781
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:46,780
 And it's really, it's hard for amateur singers

1782
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:47,620
 to sing that well.

1783
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:48,780
 And the studio bosses were like,

1784
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:50,700
 "No one's going to buy the sheet music.

1785
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:52,980
 "This is junk, change it."

1786
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:54,340
 - 'Cause you can't sing along to it easily.

1787
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:55,180
 - Pretty much, yeah.

1788
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:57,580
 And so therefore that would damage their margins of the film.

1789
00:55:57,580 --> 00:55:59,020
 - How interesting.

1790
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:01,780
 I think I should shout out to our colleague, James Rawson,

1791
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:03,220
 who I appealed to for this fact.

1792
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:05,900
 And he just really wants to air something

1793
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:06,900
 that's annoyed him for years,

1794
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:10,700
 which is the Alicia Keys debut album Songs in A Minor,

1795
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:11,900
 which was a great album.

1796
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:13,540
 (all laughing)

1797
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:14,380
 - Where's this going?

1798
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:15,820
 (all laughing)

1799
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:16,660
 - You might remember.

1800
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:17,500
 - I'm not songs.

1801
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,620
 - They're all the A Minor, it's fine.

1802
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:21,180
 Yeah, there's only...

1803
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:23,980
 Well, the internet says there's only one song in A Minor

1804
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,660
 and I wasted quite a lot of time.

1805
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:28,660
 I'm not very good at the piano, putting Spotify on,

1806
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:30,300
 and then working out what key they're all in.

1807
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:32,260
 And I think there are two songs in A Minor on it,

1808
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:34,580
 but it's still not all of the songs.

1809
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:36,340
 It's only two out of 16.

1810
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:37,660
 So Alicia...

1811
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:38,500
 - That's great.

1812
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,860
 - Sort yourself out.

1813
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:42,060
 And then I learned you had a son called Egypt,

1814
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:43,260
 but he has been to Egypt.

1815
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:44,660
 (all laughing)

1816
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:46,660
 - But in fairness, she's called Alicia Keys.

1817
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:48,900
 So obviously it's going to be in different keys.

1818
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:49,740
 - Brilliant.

1819
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:50,580
 - That's a good point.

1820
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:51,500
 She's pulled it back.

1821
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:54,060
 (all laughing)

1822
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:56,380
 - Here's an interesting thing.

1823
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:58,460
 The song Ain't No Sunshine by Bill Withers.

1824
00:56:58,460 --> 00:56:59,860
 - Yep. - Oh yeah.

1825
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:01,500
 - Is Unfinished.

1826
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:02,460
 - Is it? - Yeah.

1827
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:03,300
 - Really?

1828
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:04,140
 'Cause it just goes,

1829
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:06,700
 ♪ I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know ♪

1830
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:08,700
 And I've never got to the end of that bit.

1831
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:10,180
 - That's the bit.

1832
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:12,420
 He got to the recording booth with the song Unfinished

1833
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:14,100
 and he just improvised,

1834
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:15,860
 ♪ I know, I know, I know, I know, I know ♪

1835
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:18,140
 And he was like, "I'll do this later."

1836
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:20,260
 - It walked out the booth so it sounded like a fade.

1837
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:21,620
 (all laughing)

1838
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:22,460
 - Is that true?

1839
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:23,660
 - Yeah. - That's really funny.

1840
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:25,340
 - Well, thinking it'll come to me in the moment,

1841
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:26,180
 it's fine. - Yeah.

1842
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:28,140
 (all laughing)

1843
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:28,980
 - That's great.

1844
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:29,980
 - But yeah, if you listen long enough,

1845
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:31,140
 it goes, "No, I don't know."

1846
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:33,340
 (all laughing)

1847
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:35,920
 (upbeat music)

1848
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:39,340
 - Okay, that's it.

1849
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:40,300
 That is all of our facts.

1850
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:41,620
