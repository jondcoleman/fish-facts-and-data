00:00:02,00:00:14,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:14,00:00:16,"of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:16,00:00:18,a weekly podcast coming to you
00:00:18,00:00:20,from the QI offices in Hoburn.
00:00:20,00:00:22,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:22,00:00:24,"I'm sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:24,00:00:26,James Harkin and Anna Tyshinski.
00:00:26,00:00:28,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:28,00:00:31,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:31,00:00:35,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:35,00:00:38,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Anna."
00:00:38,00:00:41,- My fact this week is that if an eel
00:00:41,00:00:43,"ends up in a predator's stomach,"
00:00:43,00:00:45,it can reverse out through its gills.
00:00:45,00:00:49,- That's pretty amazing.
00:00:49,00:00:50,- This is Japanese eels.
00:00:50,00:00:52,And it's recently found out that they can get swallowed
00:00:52,00:00:56,"by these sleeper fish, dark sleeper fish."
00:00:56,00:00:59,"And then they go through the digestive tract,"
00:00:59,00:01:03,"but then they are just able to wibble their way back,"
00:01:03,00:01:05,back out towards the gills and then slink out.
00:01:05,00:01:07,I think some slunk out through the mouth
00:01:07,00:01:08,and then some were able to slink their way out
00:01:08,00:01:11,actually through the slits that were the gills.
00:01:11,00:01:12,"- Yeah, that's amazing."
00:01:12,00:01:16,I actually don't really have a good idea of fish anatomy.
00:01:16,00:01:17,I wouldn't have thought that the gills
00:01:17,00:01:19,would be attached to the digestive system.
00:01:19,00:01:20,"- It does sound all hollow, doesn't it?"
00:01:20,00:01:21,- Yeah.
00:01:21,00:01:22,- We say that.
00:01:22,00:01:24,"- Our gills, as people."
00:01:24,00:01:25,- Our lungs.
00:01:25,00:01:26,"- Yeah, are sort of connected."
00:01:26,00:01:29,"- You know, there's a bit where the pipe's branch, but--"
00:01:29,00:01:30,- That's true.
00:01:30,00:01:31,It's like if you swallow a piece of apple
00:01:31,00:01:33,the wrong way it goes down towards your lungs.
00:01:33,00:01:34,- Exactly.
00:01:34,00:01:36,"I mean, kind of sort of the same way"
00:01:36,00:01:37,they're coming out of the bit.
00:01:37,00:01:38,We use the breathing.
00:01:38,00:01:41,"- Yeah, you tend to take a few turns, probably."
00:01:41,00:01:41,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:01:41,00:01:42,But it is mad.
00:01:42,00:01:43,- It is insane.
00:01:43,00:01:44,"- And the scientists who did it,"
00:01:44,00:01:46,"I love it, it was a team at Nagasaki University."
00:01:46,00:01:49,And they filled the eels with the chemical
00:01:49,00:01:51,"that meant they could be x-ray,"
00:01:51,00:01:52,they could show up on an x-ray.
00:01:52,00:01:54,"And then, it was really a bit mean,"
00:01:54,00:01:57,"they just introduced the eels to the dark sleeper fish,"
00:01:57,00:01:59,which we're gonna be very hungry for them.
00:01:59,00:02:01,And one would get swallowed and then they'd just observe.
00:02:01,00:02:04,"And about a third of the time, the eel escaped."
00:02:04,00:02:05,- That's interesting.
00:02:05,00:02:07,"Do we think it happens in the wild, then?"
00:02:07,00:02:08,- I think it definitely does.
00:02:08,00:02:09,"- Yeah, it does, I think."
00:02:09,00:02:12,"And they see that some make it halfway out,"
00:02:12,00:02:14,"some almost make it out,"
00:02:14,00:02:16,but they get stuck with their heads.
00:02:16,00:02:17,"It's not, yeah, it's not a foolproof process."
00:02:17,00:02:19,But what a weird thing to be the sleeper fish.
00:02:19,00:02:20,You eat your lunch.
00:02:20,00:02:21,- I know.
00:02:21,00:02:23,- And then it's sitting next to you a minute later.
00:02:23,00:02:24,- It does happen a bit in nature.
00:02:24,00:02:25,Doesn't it?
00:02:25,00:02:27,That things get eaten and then can escape.
00:02:27,00:02:28,- Yes.
00:02:28,00:02:29,- I reckon.
00:02:29,00:02:29,Like Jonah.
00:02:29,00:02:30,- Jonah?
00:02:30,00:02:31,- I think is one of them.
00:02:31,00:02:32,- Is that his nature?
00:02:32,00:02:36,- There's a snail called Tornatelides boiningi
00:02:36,00:02:38,that's also found in Japan.
00:02:38,00:02:39,And it's swallowed by this bird.
00:02:39,00:02:44,And 5% of them are able to escape out of the bum.
00:02:44,00:02:45,- Out of the bum?
00:02:45,00:02:46,- Out of the bum.
00:02:46,00:02:47,- Okay.
00:02:47,00:02:47,- That's all the way through.
00:02:47,00:02:48,"That's very impressive, isn't it?"
00:02:48,00:02:49,- That's a waiting game.
00:02:49,00:02:51,"- Well, on the other hand, you don't have to reverse."
00:02:51,00:02:53,You just put your head down and go for it.
00:02:53,00:02:54,- I do.
00:02:54,00:02:55,- Yeah.
00:02:55,00:02:57,- But then 5% of them can get through and survive
00:02:57,00:02:59,for at least one week.
00:02:59,00:03:00,"And actually quite often when they come out,"
00:03:00,00:03:02,"if it's a female who's pregnant,"
00:03:02,00:03:04,they'll give birth straight afterwards.
00:03:04,00:03:05,And some people-
00:03:05,00:03:07,"- That, as in like it brings on neighbor."
00:03:07,00:03:07,- Yeah.
00:03:07,00:03:08,"- Wow, like eating a curry or something."
00:03:08,00:03:09,Maybe she did it on purpose.
00:03:09,00:03:10,"She was so sick, big time."
00:03:10,00:03:13,"- I don't think it's like in the Lansdale community,"
00:03:13,00:03:14,"they're like, oh, maybe if we have sex,"
00:03:14,00:03:16,then the baby will come.
00:03:16,00:03:18,"And they're like, yeah, but maybe if we get eaten"
00:03:18,00:03:19,"by a bird, it will come."
00:03:19,00:03:21,- That's just the inducing method.
00:03:21,00:03:22,"Imagine that at hospitals,"
00:03:22,00:03:25,if you have to be swallowed by an animal at all.
00:03:25,00:03:26,Baby needs to come early.
00:03:26,00:03:31,I found this great book called Eels by James Prosek.
00:03:31,00:03:32,It's one of those classic books that we love
00:03:32,00:03:34,"where it's just the single subject,"
00:03:34,00:03:36,the whole history of the animal.
00:03:36,00:03:38,And it's pretty fascinating.
00:03:38,00:03:40,"We've spoken about before about how Eels,"
00:03:40,00:03:41,"they have the call,"
00:03:41,00:03:43,which kind of brings them back to the ocean.
00:03:43,00:03:45,'Cause they are born in salt water
00:03:45,00:03:48,and they find river water in order to give birth.
00:03:48,00:03:50,And most animals do the opposite of that.
00:03:50,00:03:52,Salmon will do the opposite of that.
00:03:52,00:03:53,They're so mysterious.
00:03:53,00:03:54,And we've spoken about this.
00:03:54,00:03:56,"They've never, we just never have seen"
00:03:56,00:03:59,any pregnant Eels really or how they give birth.
00:03:59,00:04:01,But what's fascinating is how strong that call is.
00:04:01,00:04:03,"So this guy, James Prosek,"
00:04:03,00:04:06,"he has some Eels in his house, in a tank."
00:04:06,00:04:07,And he said he woke up one morning
00:04:07,00:04:09,"and they had busted through the top,"
00:04:09,00:04:10,which was held down with rocks
00:04:10,00:04:12,"and they were wriggling on the floor,"
00:04:12,00:04:13,just trying to get out.
00:04:13,00:04:14,- You're joking.
00:04:14,00:04:16,"- So then he reinforced it, he put them back in,"
00:04:16,00:04:18,put the lid on and then he came down
00:04:18,00:04:21,and they were slamming their heads into the sea.
00:04:21,00:04:24,- They were constructing a rudimentary drill
00:04:24,00:04:25,from the stuff in their tank.
00:04:25,00:04:26,That was incredible.
00:04:26,00:04:27,"- So basically some of them,"
00:04:27,00:04:29,"even like to the point of kill themselves,"
00:04:29,00:04:30,but they were smacking their heads
00:04:30,00:04:32,so hard to try and get through this thing.
00:04:32,00:04:34,"- Okay, I'm not going to say that that's not true,"
00:04:34,00:04:35,but that's amazing.
00:04:35,00:04:36,- It's horror film.
00:04:36,00:04:39,- It's in his book and he's like a lead illness writer.
00:04:39,00:04:42,"- I was implying, there's a subtext there that I think."
00:04:42,00:04:44,There is a thing that when they first realized
00:04:44,00:04:46,"that there was a homininstinct in birds,"
00:04:46,00:04:48,"one of the experiments they did was,"
00:04:48,00:04:50,they got the birds in a cage
00:04:50,00:04:52,and put little sort of ink on their feet
00:04:52,00:04:55,and then they would put paper on the floor of the cage
00:04:55,00:04:56,and then they could see that the birds
00:04:56,00:04:58,were trying to go in a certain direction.
00:04:58,00:04:58,- Right.
00:04:58,00:04:59,"- God, it's so interesting."
00:04:59,00:05:01,"- It is amazing 'cause they will often,"
00:05:01,00:05:04,"if there's a bit of damp ground in a field,"
00:05:04,00:05:06,they will make their way out of their pond
00:05:06,00:05:07,or whatever bit of fresh water they're in
00:05:07,00:05:08,and they'll slither along
00:05:08,00:05:11,and start eating some farmland stuff and come back.
00:05:11,00:05:12,"But when they want to go back to the ocean,"
00:05:12,00:05:14,"this is all true, James."
00:05:14,00:05:16,They can stay in wait.
00:05:16,00:05:18,They just wait and wait until the circumstances are right
00:05:18,00:05:20,to get them back to the ocean.
00:05:20,00:05:21,"And then once they need to make that trip,"
00:05:21,00:05:23,once a storm has come
00:05:23,00:05:24,and the water levels have risen a bit
00:05:24,00:05:25,"and everything's wet,"
00:05:25,00:05:28,they perform like ninja-like abilities.
00:05:28,00:05:29,"So if they get to a hill,"
00:05:29,00:05:31,they roll into a ball and roll down the hill.
00:05:31,00:05:32,- No way.
00:05:32,00:05:33,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:05:33,00:05:34,They can climb up walls by braiding themselves
00:05:34,00:05:38,"along the side of moths, walls, and it's extraordinary."
00:05:38,00:05:39,- Did you watch a cartoon?
00:05:39,00:05:42,"- This is James Prasek, Eels."
00:05:42,00:05:43,- It is incredible.
00:05:43,00:05:46,"Do you know where has an eel festival, by the way?"
00:05:46,00:05:46,- Eely?
00:05:46,00:05:48,"- Because, oh, Eely, yeah, Eely."
00:05:48,00:05:49,- Correct.
00:05:49,00:05:50,- Which one?
00:05:50,00:05:51,- Eely.
00:05:51,00:05:52,"- Well, there we go."
00:05:52,00:05:53,"- Not Eely, London."
00:05:53,00:05:53,- It wasn't a trick question.
00:05:53,00:05:55,It was actually just an on-the-nose.
00:05:55,00:05:57,"- Because Eely is named after the eels, isn't it?"
00:05:57,00:05:58,- I believe so.
00:05:58,00:06:02,"But very sadly, the last eel catcher in Eely"
00:06:02,00:06:03,retired 10 years ago.
00:06:03,00:06:06,"Because they've had this terrible decline of population,"
00:06:06,00:06:08,mostly due to humans.
00:06:08,00:06:11,"But you know, there used to be a staple food in Cambridgeshire."
00:06:11,00:06:12,I just find that so bizarre.
00:06:12,00:06:13,- Yeah.
00:06:13,00:06:14,"- You just, like, a thousand years ago,"
00:06:14,00:06:16,"you had a rock, you had an eel, effectively."
00:06:16,00:06:20,And the main thing to do now is removing barriers in rivers.
00:06:20,00:06:22,'Cause there are just so many
00:06:22,00:06:23,hundreds and thousands of these things.
00:06:23,00:06:25,"And most of them are out at, like, a defunct."
00:06:25,00:06:26,They're like an old water mill.
00:06:26,00:06:27,- Yeah.
00:06:27,00:06:28,"- You know, build a barrier across the river"
00:06:28,00:06:29,'cause they needed to harness the power of--
00:06:29,00:06:30,- And locks and stuff.
00:06:30,00:06:31,"Like, we've got quite a lot of eel,"
00:06:31,00:06:33,we've got quite a lot of eel stares near us.
00:06:33,00:06:34,- Do you know?
00:06:34,00:06:35,"- Which would like to go over locks,"
00:06:35,00:06:36,"'cause I live in the Fens,"
00:06:36,00:06:37,which is where they used to be all over the stuff.
00:06:37,00:06:37,- Yes.
00:06:37,00:06:38,- Like your eel country.
00:06:38,00:06:39,- Were it?
00:06:39,00:06:40,"Well, yeah, I'm really, yeah."
00:06:40,00:06:43,It's really hard to get an atlas of eel barriers
00:06:43,00:06:45,because the researchers looking at it found
00:06:45,00:06:47,there are 300 different words
00:06:47,00:06:49,which describe obstacles and rivers.
00:06:49,00:06:51,Which I find insane. - Really?
00:06:51,00:06:54,"- You know, a sluice, or a lock, or a weir,"
00:06:54,00:06:55,"or, like, all of these things."
00:06:55,00:06:58,"There are hundreds of terms, so you need to map them."
00:06:58,00:07:00,"But there aren't, like, groups removing them slowly,"
00:07:00,00:07:01,"but surely, which is very cool."
00:07:01,00:07:02,- I think it's a bit mysterious
00:07:02,00:07:05,"why their numbers have declined so rapidly, you know,"
00:07:05,00:07:07,by 90% in the last 50 years.
00:07:07,00:07:09,But they're so sought after now.
00:07:09,00:07:13,- There are 350 million eels taken from Europe to Asia
00:07:13,00:07:13,every year.
00:07:13,00:07:14,- Is this legal or illegal?
00:07:14,00:07:16,"- All illegal, very illegal."
00:07:16,00:07:17,"- This is smug eel, smuggling?"
00:07:17,00:07:19,"- Yes, because they're very endangered now,"
00:07:19,00:07:20,and so they're very protected.
00:07:20,00:07:22,You're only allowed to take certain ones and...
00:07:22,00:07:24,"- I'd love if they get there,"
00:07:24,00:07:25,and then they wake up the next morning
00:07:25,00:07:27,"after having arrived,"
00:07:27,00:07:29,all the eels have just migrated back.
00:07:29,00:07:30,(all laughing)
00:07:30,00:07:32,- Eel shape holes in all of the buildings.
00:07:32,00:07:34,(all laughing)
00:07:34,00:07:35,"- Which are just holes, aren't they?"
00:07:35,00:07:37,(all laughing)
00:07:37,00:07:40,"- Well, if they might go sideways through the wall."
00:07:40,00:07:42,"Speaking of smuggling, or not speaking of smuggling,"
00:07:42,00:07:45,but you'll see where the connection is.
00:07:45,00:07:47,"Last year, there was doctors in Vietnam"
00:07:47,00:07:51,who pulled out a two-foot eel from man's intestines
00:07:51,00:07:53,after he inserted it into his bottom.
00:07:53,00:07:54,"- Oh, dear."
00:07:54,00:07:57,"- And the problem was not so much putting the eel up there,"
00:07:57,00:07:58,"although that was quite bad,"
00:07:58,00:08:00,but he'd also shoved a lemon up there
00:08:00,00:08:02,so that it couldn't escape.
00:08:02,00:08:05,"- No, I don't believe this, James."
00:08:05,00:08:08,"- Well, it's true, it's true."
00:08:08,00:08:09,- It sounds like he's trying to make a delicious meal
00:08:09,00:08:11,"inside himself, a squeeze of lemon,"
00:08:11,00:08:13,and then was it a sprinkle of salt?
00:08:13,00:08:14,"- The man survived,"
00:08:14,00:08:16,even though the eel had started biting
00:08:16,00:08:18,through his abdominal cavity.
00:08:18,00:08:21,- I don't think we can blame the eel a touch for that.
00:08:21,00:08:23,"- No, no, I've not blamed the eel, I've not."
00:08:23,00:08:25,"- I'm blaming you for raising this,"
00:08:25,00:08:28,"and I certainly, for one, I'm not finding it funny,"
00:08:28,00:08:30,"because I'm well aware that in 2013,"
00:08:30,00:08:32,"there was a similar, very serious incident,"
00:08:32,00:08:36,"and 33 people, staff at Auckland City Hospital,"
00:08:36,00:08:38,"were punished, and a few of them sacked"
00:08:38,00:08:40,for looking at an x-ray unnecessarily
00:08:40,00:08:42,of a man who had an eel stuck
00:08:42,00:08:45,in the lowest parts of his digestive system.
00:08:45,00:08:47,"- Well, you can get fired for looking at an x-ray?"
00:08:47,00:08:48,- It was found that they did not need
00:08:48,00:08:50,"to be looking at the x-ray, all his notes."
00:08:50,00:08:52,"- Oh, I can see his notes. - Oh, come on."
00:08:52,00:08:54,- Maybe if it has incriminating--
00:08:54,00:08:56,"- Down over here, speaking up for medical malpractice."
00:08:56,00:08:58,(all laughing)
00:08:58,00:08:59,If as long as it's funny.
00:08:59,00:09:00,- You have to learn.
00:09:00,00:09:04,"- As a doctor, to see things you would not normally see."
00:09:04,00:09:06,"- Exactly, what happens if then the next day,"
00:09:06,00:09:08,"someone else comes with an eagle up the bum,"
00:09:08,00:09:09,but you don't recognize it?
00:09:09,00:09:10,"- Yeah, sorry, I don't know what to do."
00:09:10,00:09:13,"It was too funny, and I wasn't allowed to do it."
00:09:13,00:09:15,(all laughing)
00:09:15,00:09:19,- Do you know where European and American eels come from?
00:09:19,00:09:20,- European America?
00:09:20,00:09:22,"- No, the ocean bits, where they're born, do you know?"
00:09:22,00:09:24,- They haven't been said on the orders from the Sargasso Sea.
00:09:24,00:09:27,"- Sargasso Sea, but do you know where the Sargasso Sea is?"
00:09:27,00:09:30,- It's in the Atlantic. - Is it Bermuda?
00:09:30,00:09:31,"- It's Bermuda. - Oh, God."
00:09:31,00:09:33,"- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
00:09:33,00:09:34,It is within the Triangle.
00:09:34,00:09:36,Let's head this off at the path.
00:09:36,00:09:37,- Is it within the Triangle?
00:09:37,00:09:38,"- Well, the Triangle is an undefined border."
00:09:38,00:09:40,We don't really know how far the Triangle extends.
00:09:40,00:09:41,- Are we in the Triangle now?
00:09:41,00:09:42,"- Technically, yes."
00:09:42,00:09:46,- I thought it went from Bermuda to the tip of Florida
00:09:46,00:09:48,to the tip of South America.
00:09:48,00:09:49,"I thought it was defined, no."
00:09:49,00:09:51,"- I don't know, I don't really know about this stuff."
00:09:51,00:09:54,(all laughing)
00:09:54,00:09:56,- It might be my area of interest.
00:09:56,00:09:58,It might be a lumpy triangle.
00:09:58,00:09:59,There might be a little bit of flexibility.
00:09:59,00:10:02,- I heard it on a podcast called The Crypto-Tactics.
00:10:02,00:10:05,They were very clear about the definitions.
00:10:05,00:10:07,"- Oh, well, trust them, great show."
00:10:07,00:10:08,- What's your theory?
00:10:08,00:10:10,They're all getting started outside there.
00:10:10,00:10:12,"- Just saying the mystery of them,"
00:10:12,00:10:14,I can't believe that hasn't been folded in
00:10:14,00:10:15,as an extraordinary creation.
00:10:15,00:10:19,"- If they're being called to a, let's say a mothership,"
00:10:19,00:10:21,"metaphorically speaking,"
00:10:21,00:10:23,"that's they're being drawn to a mothership, aren't they?"
00:10:23,00:10:24,- And they talk about it.
00:10:24,00:10:26,"They say the mystery of them being,"
00:10:26,00:10:27,this calling to the Sargasso Sea.
00:10:27,00:10:31,"They left as glass eggs, basically, in their look."
00:10:31,00:10:34,They get carried in the currents all over the world.
00:10:34,00:10:36,They end up in fresh water.
00:10:36,00:10:38,They live there up to a hundred years.
00:10:38,00:10:41,And then they somehow find their way back to the Sargasso.
00:10:41,00:10:45,"- I suppose that is also true of many, many, many other species"
00:10:45,00:10:48,that they managed to go back to their original breeding grounds.
00:10:48,00:10:49,"- They are mysterious, aren't they?"
00:10:49,00:10:52,"They are kind of, it's incredible we haven't cracked it."
00:10:52,00:10:53,Even with all our knowledge.
00:10:53,00:10:56,"You know, you can, all your computers and all of that"
00:10:56,00:10:58,"and all your internet and you still can't do it, can you?"
00:10:58,00:10:59,- Can't crack the eels.
00:10:59,00:11:02,"- Yeah, get on to it, eel on musk."
00:11:02,00:11:03,- Oh God.
00:11:03,00:11:04,"- Well done, well done."
00:11:04,00:11:05,Let's distract them with that.
00:11:05,00:11:08,"We've mostly been talking about,"
00:11:08,00:11:12,"yeah, European and European eels."
00:11:12,00:11:15,"But conger eels, we have, and they're massive."
00:11:15,00:11:18,And they all hold on to each other.
00:11:18,00:11:20,- They all go back to the Sargasso Sea in one big line.
00:11:20,00:11:24,Apart from when one line of congery
00:11:24,00:11:27,is accidentally breaks off and goes to the wrong place.
00:11:27,00:11:30,"- That's the European eel, the American eel."
00:11:30,00:11:32,"- No, the conger eels, different spelling,"
00:11:32,00:11:35,"are, well, hunted all over British Isles,"
00:11:35,00:11:37,particularly in Cornwall and the Isles of Silly.
00:11:37,00:11:40,"And I just read in an old book,"
00:11:40,00:11:41,"and I can't find it anywhere else,"
00:11:41,00:11:42,"but the way to catch conger eels,"
00:11:42,00:11:45,"you know, sometimes you'll put a stick into a river"
00:11:45,00:11:47,and the eels would wind around it and then you'd pull it up.
00:11:47,00:11:48,"- Didn't know that, okay."
00:11:48,00:11:49,- I think that's what people did.
00:11:49,00:11:52,"Well, apparently the traditional way to catch them"
00:11:52,00:11:55,in the Isles of Silly is you suspend a small boy
00:11:55,00:11:58,"upside down in front of the hole in which they live,"
00:11:58,00:12:01,wait for the eel to wrap itself around him.
00:12:01,00:12:03,And these things can be up to three meters long.
00:12:03,00:12:05,And then you pull the boy up.
00:12:05,00:12:07,- Why does he need to be upside down?
00:12:07,00:12:10,- I think maybe he wants me to grab them.
00:12:10,00:12:12,"- He would get ahead of it before too long, this boy."
00:12:12,00:12:13,- I think they come pretty fast.
00:12:13,00:12:15,"- We don't seem to be concerned about his welfare,"
00:12:15,00:12:16,"so it's fine, but."
00:12:16,00:12:18,- He's happy to oblige.
00:12:18,00:12:19,He gets some of the jelly deal.
00:12:19,00:12:21,"- Do you guys remember, I'm sure I pitched an eel fact"
00:12:21,00:12:23,about six months ago and it didn't get any traction
00:12:23,00:12:25,with you guys.
00:12:25,00:12:26,"- Oh, there we go."
00:12:26,00:12:27,"- It was because in my local news agent,"
00:12:27,00:12:30,they had a fisherman monthly magazine.
00:12:30,00:12:32,And it had a picture on the front of a guy
00:12:32,00:12:33,with the largest eel you've ever seen.
00:12:33,00:12:34,It was incredible.
00:12:34,00:12:35,"- Yeah, but that's not a fact."
00:12:35,00:12:36,That's the thing.
00:12:36,00:12:37,You can't just say my fact this week
00:12:37,00:12:39,is you get really big eels.
00:12:39,00:12:41,- He'd broken the record for biggest eel caught in Britain.
00:12:41,00:12:42,I can't remember his name now.
00:12:42,00:12:44,"I wrote it down at the time, but I've forgotten it."
00:12:44,00:12:45,- And what was the fact?
00:12:45,00:12:48,- It's just like the record for the largest eel
00:12:48,00:12:50,fished in Britain have been smashed by this guy.
00:12:50,00:12:53,"But guys, honestly, it was like an elephant's trunk."
00:12:53,00:12:53,It was incredible.
00:12:53,00:12:54,- Yeah.
00:12:54,00:12:55,- It was a few feet long.
00:12:55,00:12:57,- I think this is maybe because this was this period
00:12:57,00:13:00,where all your facts were the most massive kettle
00:13:00,00:13:04,in just everything was an undefinable size.
00:13:04,00:13:06,You refused to tell us the measurements of.
00:13:06,00:13:07,- It was a trolley big eel.
00:13:07,00:13:09,"Anyway, I bought that magazine and I think I'm sure"
00:13:09,00:13:11,there's a fisherman near where I live
00:13:11,00:13:12,who's gone absolutely devastated
00:13:12,00:13:14,'cause he trots along to his news agent
00:13:14,00:13:16,for the one copy they stocked with this magazine.
00:13:16,00:13:18,It's not a big rack of them.
00:13:18,00:13:22,"- Oh, he's missed the biggest eel news in the century."
00:13:22,00:13:24,- He's still living in a full paradise.
00:13:24,00:13:25,"- He's done the time, Andy."
00:13:25,00:13:27,He owned that edition.
00:13:27,00:13:30,I feel like there's an elephant in the room
00:13:30,00:13:31,given that we're doing a fact about things
00:13:31,00:13:33,surviving being eaten.
00:13:33,00:13:35,"In years to come, people will have forgotten this news story"
00:13:35,00:13:37,that has been quite big this month
00:13:37,00:13:39,of the person who's been eaten by a whale.
00:13:39,00:13:42,"- He was a kayaker, wasn't he, a Venezuelan guy?"
00:13:42,00:13:43,- Did that happen?
00:13:43,00:13:45,"'Cause I saw the headline, didn't read the article"
00:13:45,00:13:48,and then saw a debunk and didn't read the article either.
00:13:48,00:13:49,- It did happen.
00:13:49,00:13:52,- The video is quite good.
00:13:52,00:13:53,- The video is amazing.
00:13:53,00:13:54,- How enticing does something have to be there
00:13:54,00:13:57,before you all click on it?
00:13:57,00:14:00,- I go through a lot of web pages every single day.
00:14:00,00:14:01,"- I'm like, yeah, yeah, whatever."
00:14:01,00:14:02,- He got into the world's mouth
00:14:02,00:14:03,and then the world's matter of mouth.
00:14:03,00:14:05,- So he did go through into this.
00:14:05,00:14:06,"- No, no, no."
00:14:06,00:14:08,There was no happening. - It was a few seconds later.
00:14:08,00:14:10,"I actually, I heard about this story on a recent episode"
00:14:10,00:14:11,of what was the show you were talking about?
00:14:11,00:14:12,Cryptid fact.
00:14:12,00:14:15,- They did a really good breakdown of that whole story.
00:14:15,00:14:17,- Did you go through that bit by bit?
00:14:17,00:14:18,"- They did, yeah."
00:14:18,00:14:19,"- Actually, that was the thing"
00:14:19,00:14:21,where I saw the headline that just scrolled past it.
00:14:21,00:14:23,(all laughing)
00:14:23,00:14:24,- Very sensible.
00:14:24,00:14:26,- I saw the weird thing about it.
00:14:26,00:14:28,"Well, there were two, there were two quite sweet things."
00:14:28,00:14:29,So they were going on a kayaking trip
00:14:29,00:14:32,for this guy's dad's birthday.
00:14:32,00:14:33,"Initially, the headlines were like,"
00:14:33,00:14:35,caught on camera by his dad.
00:14:35,00:14:37,"And I thought, oh my God, this insensitive father's"
00:14:37,00:14:39,filming the whole bloody thing.
00:14:39,00:14:41,But he did have a kayak mounted camera.
00:14:41,00:14:42,"If that's what anyone else is worried about,"
00:14:42,00:14:45,he wasn't holding the camera rather than saving his boy.
00:14:45,00:14:47,"- Yeah, oh yeah, did you take the picture"
00:14:47,00:14:49,of the insensitive dad on your show?
00:14:49,00:14:52,- I defended him because I think that if you know
00:14:52,00:14:54,"the eating habits, you'd probably go,"
00:14:54,00:14:55,he's not going to swallow him.
00:14:55,00:14:56,He'll be back in a second.
00:14:56,00:14:57,- That's about defense.
00:14:57,00:14:59,"- And also, he was a distance away."
00:14:59,00:15:00,- Yeah.
00:15:00,00:15:00,- What are you going to do?
00:15:00,00:15:02,Swim over and have a word?
00:15:02,00:15:03,You just keep filming at that point.
00:15:03,00:15:04,- You're both fathers.
00:15:04,00:15:07,"- Also, you'll need a crime reference number"
00:15:07,00:15:08,"from the police, so they need evidence."
00:15:08,00:15:09,Take it from me.
00:15:09,00:15:12,"- I mean, I'm not normally on the side of this kind of thing,"
00:15:12,00:15:14,but I've just been skiing with my three-year-old
00:15:14,00:15:16,for the number of times I've filmed her falling over
00:15:16,00:15:18,as opposed to going and helping her.
00:15:18,00:15:18,- Yeah.
00:15:18,00:15:21,"- Right, you guys, social services are coming for everyone."
00:15:21,00:15:22,"Imagine, this is all right."
00:15:22,00:15:24,I'm sure he'll come out with a mouth any time now.
00:15:24,00:15:26,"So it was mounted on his kayak,"
00:15:26,00:15:28,"so the dad was not just holding a camera filming him,"
00:15:28,00:15:29,but I thought the quite interesting thing
00:15:29,00:15:32,about human reactions is the dad didn't make a sound
00:15:32,00:15:34,"when it happened, so he's seen what happens,"
00:15:34,00:15:35,but he's so shocked.
00:15:35,00:15:37,"And when the guy was then spat out of the whale's mouth,"
00:15:37,00:15:39,"the dad was like, mate, you're okay."
00:15:39,00:15:40,"Shit, don't panic."
00:15:40,00:15:41,It's still there.
00:15:41,00:15:42,Get back in your kayak.
00:15:42,00:15:43,- But it's silent.
00:15:43,00:15:45,"I see, what does his son get followed by a whale?"
00:15:45,00:15:46,"- Well, men don't like talking to each other."
00:15:46,00:15:47,What do you want?
00:15:47,00:15:48,(all laughing)
00:15:48,00:15:50,Unless it's in a podcast format.
00:15:50,00:15:52,"- Even then, the only question is,"
00:15:52,00:15:54,is that the new kayak that's just been...
00:15:54,00:15:56,(all laughing)
00:15:56,00:15:57,"- I think we want to normalize this,"
00:15:57,00:15:59,"and we want to say to guys, if you're listening to this,"
00:15:59,00:16:01,"if your son has ever eaten by a whale,"
00:16:01,00:16:03,then do try and talk about it.
00:16:03,00:16:04,- Yeah.
00:16:04,00:16:05,"- Yeah, make yourself."
00:16:05,00:16:06,- Be a legend.
00:16:06,00:16:07,Have a chat.
00:16:07,00:16:10,(upbeat music)
00:16:10,00:16:13,(upbeat music)
00:16:13,00:16:15,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two,"
00:16:15,00:16:16,and that is James.
00:16:16,00:16:17,"- Okay, my fact this week is that"
00:16:17,00:16:19,Sweden's Minister for Equality
00:16:19,00:16:23,has a pathological fear of bananas.
00:16:23,00:16:24,- But all bananas equally.
00:16:24,00:16:26,(all laughing)
00:16:26,00:16:27,- Very nice.
00:16:27,00:16:28,- Yeah.
00:16:28,00:16:29,- This is incredible.
00:16:29,00:16:31,"I mean, it really is a fear, isn't it?"
00:16:31,00:16:34,"- It's, well, yes, it is a fear."
00:16:34,00:16:37,"It was in the newspapers quite recently,"
00:16:37,00:16:40,"especially in Sweden, unsurprisingly."
00:16:40,00:16:42,"- That's where it started, didn't it?"
00:16:42,00:16:44,"- Yeah, ""Sweet Afraid of Bananas."""
00:16:44,00:16:45,"- Oh, yeah."
00:16:45,00:16:46,"- She herself is a vegetable, yes?"
00:16:46,00:16:47,"- Oh, yeah."
00:16:47,00:16:48,- I suppose so.
00:16:48,00:16:49,"- Sweet, sweet."
00:16:49,00:16:51,"- She, there was some leaked emails"
00:16:51,00:16:55,"to a tabloid newspaper called Expressen,"
00:16:55,00:16:56,"and they said that this lady,"
00:16:56,00:16:59,"who's called Paulina Brandberg,"
00:16:59,00:17:01,"has a strong allergy to bananas,"
00:17:01,00:17:03,so we would appreciate it if there were no bananas
00:17:03,00:17:06,in the room where she'll be staying.
00:17:06,00:17:07,And the big scandal really is
00:17:07,00:17:09,that she isn't allergic to bananas.
00:17:09,00:17:10,She's just scared of them.
00:17:10,00:17:11,- Yes.
00:17:11,00:17:13,"- And she said, like, they asked her,"
00:17:13,00:17:15,"they were like, ""Are you really allergic to bananas?"""
00:17:15,00:17:19,"And she's like, ""Well, it's sort of analogy, you could say."
00:17:19,00:17:21,"It's something that I got professional help for."""
00:17:21,00:17:23,And then eventually it came out
00:17:23,00:17:24,that she was just really hated them.
00:17:24,00:17:27,"But, I mean, in fairness, you know, it's equally bad."
00:17:27,00:17:28,Is it equally bad?
00:17:28,00:17:30,"Well, it depends how bad your allergy is."
00:17:30,00:17:32,"- Yeah, I don't think it's, this is a big,"
00:17:32,00:17:34,I don't think this is a big scandal.
00:17:34,00:17:37,There have been bigger in the world of politics.
00:17:37,00:17:40,"- I know Sweden's politics are, you know, changing,"
00:17:40,00:17:41,"but it's still, guys,"
00:17:41,00:17:42,if this is still what you're concerned with.
00:17:42,00:17:43,- And you know what?
00:17:43,00:17:45,"Like, the opposition party,"
00:17:45,00:17:46,they could have taken advantage of this
00:17:46,00:17:49,and maybe brought down the Swedish government.
00:17:49,00:17:53,"But one of the opposition social democrats,"
00:17:53,00:17:57,Teresa Carvalho said that she also has fear of bananas.
00:17:57,00:17:58,- I love that.
00:17:58,00:17:59,"- And on this issue, we stand united"
00:17:59,00:18:01,against a common enemy.
00:18:01,00:18:01,- Yeah.
00:18:01,00:18:03,- That's not plausible.
00:18:03,00:18:04,So I'll try to jump on the bandwagon.
00:18:04,00:18:06,"- There can't be two, you're right."
00:18:06,00:18:08,- It's quite a rare phobia.
00:18:08,00:18:09,"- Well, I think it's lovely."
00:18:09,00:18:12,"And she, you know, she can't just spot a banana"
00:18:12,00:18:13,and be alarmed by it.
00:18:13,00:18:15,She can smell bananas
00:18:15,00:18:18,"or if someone has recently eaten a banana in the room,"
00:18:18,00:18:19,she can truffle that out.
00:18:19,00:18:20,"- You know why, speaking of truffles,"
00:18:20,00:18:24,it's a bit like my severe hatred of mushrooms.
00:18:24,00:18:25,- Yeah.
00:18:25,00:18:25,- Isn't it?
00:18:25,00:18:26,"Like, I can tell if there's a mushroom"
00:18:26,00:18:29,in someone's eater mushrooms recently and stuff.
00:18:29,00:18:30,- You don't have a phobia of mushrooms.
00:18:30,00:18:32,"- I think I do really, actually, yeah."
00:18:32,00:18:34,"- I find them really disgusting,"
00:18:34,00:18:36,"but also if there's one growing in the corner,"
00:18:36,00:18:37,I'll try not walk near it kind of thing.
00:18:37,00:18:39,- It's a stronger version to something
00:18:39,00:18:41,which actually is not gonna harm you.
00:18:41,00:18:43,- The Prime Minister backed her as well.
00:18:43,00:18:44,"He sort of said, yeah."
00:18:44,00:18:46,"So like, when he found out it was a phobia."
00:18:46,00:18:47,"- What was the alternative to sack her, basically?"
00:18:47,00:18:50,- I think she was getting mocked
00:18:50,00:18:52,and he said we shouldn't be mocking people
00:18:52,00:18:54,for their various little known phobias.
00:18:54,00:18:55,"- Well, it's hard, isn't it?"
00:18:55,00:18:56,'Cause loads of people have phobias
00:18:56,00:18:58,of things that are quite mainstream.
00:18:58,00:19:01,"I mean, like, height, is that a phobia?"
00:19:01,00:19:02,- It's a bit dangerous.
00:19:02,00:19:05,"Spiders, some spiders are dangerous, you know."
00:19:05,00:19:06,- I would say these are phobias.
00:19:06,00:19:08,"'Cause these are like, they're phobias of things"
00:19:08,00:19:10,that aren't going to harm you.
00:19:10,00:19:14,A phobia of spiders in this country is totally rational.
00:19:14,00:19:16,"- There is a theory that there's some kind of spider called,"
00:19:16,00:19:18,"I think it's called the six-eyed,"
00:19:18,00:19:20,"I can't remember, is it? - More spider."
00:19:20,00:19:21,- It's a bad one.
00:19:21,00:19:24,And it can be lethal if it bites a human.
00:19:24,00:19:26,"And that lives in the plains of Africa,"
00:19:26,00:19:27,which are the cradle of humanity.
00:19:27,00:19:29,So maybe there's something genetic going on there.
00:19:29,00:19:31,So that might be where spider fear comes from.
00:19:31,00:19:33,"- Yeah, six-eyed, sound spider."
00:19:33,00:19:34,"- And spider, there you go."
00:19:34,00:19:35,"- And I think the problem, like,"
00:19:35,00:19:37,the reason that the Prime Minister of Sweden
00:19:37,00:19:40,and the opposition sort of backed her on this
00:19:40,00:19:42,"is, one, because it's ridiculous"
00:19:42,00:19:44,that anyone should care about it.
00:19:44,00:19:45,"But two, because it was kind of distracting"
00:19:45,00:19:47,from the good work that this woman's doing
00:19:47,00:19:49,in her equality. - The famously unequal
00:19:49,00:19:51,country of Sweden. (laughing)
00:19:51,00:19:52,- It's not as obscure as you think.
00:19:52,00:19:54,It was an issue that was brought up on Loose Women
00:19:54,00:19:56,"because one of the stars, Charlene White,"
00:19:56,00:19:58,has a phobia of bananas as well.
00:19:58,00:19:58,- I don't know. - Yeah.
00:19:58,00:20:01,"- It's common, all these people suddenly claiming."
00:20:01,00:20:03,- There is one person with a banana phobia
00:20:03,00:20:07,who is the most ironic person given the name.
00:20:07,00:20:08,- Oh. - Can you guess who it is?
00:20:08,00:20:10,- The guy who voiced Banana Man.
00:20:10,00:20:11,- No. - No.
00:20:11,00:20:13,"- Banana Rama, the band? - Oh, the band."
00:20:13,00:20:15,I actually checked to see if they were allergic.
00:20:15,00:20:18,- The founder of the Big Yellow Storage Company.
00:20:18,00:20:19,"- Oh, very good, but no."
00:20:19,00:20:24,So this person's surname is very related to bananas.
00:20:24,00:20:25,- John Peele.
00:20:25,00:20:26,"- Very good, but no."
00:20:26,00:20:28,- Okay. - Oh.
00:20:28,00:20:31,"- Monkey, something. - Famous types of banana."
00:20:31,00:20:34,"- Oh, Cavendish, the Duke of Cavendish."
00:20:34,00:20:36,- Cyclist Mark Cavendish.
00:20:36,00:20:37,"- Yes, sorry. - All right."
00:20:37,00:20:40,- We both know that it's the first Cavendish you think of.
00:20:40,00:20:42,- The first Cavendish that all of our listeners
00:20:42,00:20:45,"will be thinking of when they hear that name,"
00:20:45,00:20:47,the Duke of Cavendish.
00:20:47,00:20:49,"No, Mark Cavendish, the cyclist,"
00:20:49,00:20:52,he says even seeing someone eating a banana
00:20:52,00:20:54,gives him goosebumps and even thinking about it
00:20:54,00:20:55,makes him gag.
00:20:55,00:20:57,- That's incredible. - Wow.
00:20:57,00:20:59,- And he said it's the stringy bits on a banana
00:20:59,00:21:00,that he really hates.
00:21:00,00:21:03,"- They're not the best bits, for sure."
00:21:03,00:21:05,- They're not the sweetest part.
00:21:05,00:21:09,"- Well, he once won a bike race in Elania in Turkey"
00:21:09,00:21:11,and he was given the world's biggest bunch of bananas
00:21:11,00:21:12,at price.
00:21:12,00:21:16,"- Oh, God, that's terrible. - That's the scar of your fears."
00:21:16,00:21:18,And that's why it's bad having one of these niche phobias
00:21:18,00:21:19,"because it's very hard to, like,"
00:21:19,00:21:22,no one presents you with it like a bouquet of pigeons
00:21:22,00:21:24,at the end of it.
00:21:24,00:21:26,"- Another person who has a fear of bananas,"
00:21:26,00:21:28,"Harriet Kemsley, the comedian."
00:21:28,00:21:29,- The comedian.
00:21:29,00:21:32,"- Yeah, on another podcast called Off Menu,"
00:21:32,00:21:33,which I've never heard of.
00:21:33,00:21:34,Have you guys heard of that?
00:21:34,00:21:36,"- No, I think it's the cryptid factor,"
00:21:36,00:21:37,I think the fans of it.
00:21:37,00:21:41,"- Yeah, well, she was on that and she said,"
00:21:41,00:21:44,she hates it when you throw a banana peel into a bin
00:21:44,00:21:46,and it doesn't go all the way in
00:21:46,00:21:48,so it looks like it's crawling out.
00:21:48,00:21:49,"- Yeah, I can see that. - And I think I can see that,"
00:21:49,00:21:51,"actually. - Oh, gosh."
00:21:51,00:21:53,"People have a lot of time to think, don't they?"
00:21:53,00:21:54,(all laugh)
00:21:54,00:21:56,"- Sorry, but just..."
00:21:56,00:21:57,- I think it's instinct.
00:21:57,00:21:59,"- I mean, really, non-intended, yeah."
00:21:59,00:22:00,"Did we say that the Cavendish is named after,"
00:22:00,00:22:02,the Cavendish banana is named after the Duke of Cavendish?
00:22:02,00:22:03,We'll just get emails otherwise.
00:22:03,00:22:05,"- I think we have meant, I think, yeah."
00:22:05,00:22:07,- I think all of our listeners are very familiar
00:22:07,00:22:09,"with the Duke of Cavendish, aren't they?"
00:22:09,00:22:13,"- Fears of bananas, the Guardian did a bit of digging"
00:22:13,00:22:16,"into this, I think, off the back of the Swedish politician."
00:22:16,00:22:19,They found a woman with a banana phobia who had it
00:22:19,00:22:21,"pretty strongly, like, again, breaks out in a sweat,"
00:22:21,00:22:22,"can't bear being around them,"
00:22:22,00:22:24,"avoids them in the supermarket, that kind of thing."
00:22:24,00:22:27,"She once was on a flight, quite a long-haul flight."
00:22:27,00:22:29,She woke up in the morning after everyone on the flight
00:22:29,00:22:30,"had been asleep, and everyone around her"
00:22:30,00:22:34,"had been given their mid-morning snack, a banana."
00:22:34,00:22:37,"I mean, just absolute nightmare territory."
00:22:37,00:22:38,"- Imagine, you're in a plane."
00:22:38,00:22:39,- Banana's on a plane.
00:22:39,00:22:40,- It's basically...
00:22:40,00:22:41,"- Yeah, motherfucking!"
00:22:41,00:22:43,(all laugh)
00:22:43,00:22:47,"- I was looking at kind of more common, uncommon phobias,"
00:22:47,00:22:49,and bananas was a surprising one.
00:22:49,00:22:50,I didn't know that it was quite common
00:22:50,00:22:52,"among the uncommon phobias,"
00:22:52,00:22:53,"but it does seem to be bananas,"
00:22:53,00:22:58,"Psydonglobophobia, which is an intense fear of cotton balls,"
00:22:58,00:22:59,seems to be another one.
00:22:59,00:23:01,- Psydonglobophobia.
00:23:01,00:23:03,- That's surely more niche these days.
00:23:03,00:23:04,- Cotton balls?
00:23:04,00:23:06,- Are cotton balls still a big part of...
00:23:06,00:23:08,- I use them every day.
00:23:08,00:23:09,(all laugh)
00:23:09,00:23:10,"- Okay, grandma."
00:23:10,00:23:12,(all laugh)
00:23:12,00:23:15,"- Actually, you know, Anna has an extremely common accent,"
00:23:15,00:23:18,but she puts them in her cheeks and it makes her speak this way.
00:23:18,00:23:19,- Exactly.
00:23:19,00:23:22,- I've got a lovely glass antique container next to the bath
00:23:22,00:23:23,full of cotton balls.
00:23:23,00:23:25,- It doesn't surprise me as a leaf.
00:23:25,00:23:25,It doesn't surprise me.
00:23:25,00:23:27,Are they useful for washing things?
00:23:27,00:23:29,"- Yeah, I actually do it to..."
00:23:29,00:23:31,- Makeup removal.
00:23:31,00:23:34,- For women will be more I favor with cotton balls than men.
00:23:34,00:23:36,"- I mean, I have more makeup in the time that you've known me."
00:23:36,00:23:37,- Okay.
00:23:37,00:23:38,(all laugh)
00:23:38,00:23:40,- It's washing food off a child's mouth.
00:23:40,00:23:41,- Yeah.
00:23:41,00:23:42,"- Right, okay."
00:23:42,00:23:43,"- Cleaning very, very young babies' bums,"
00:23:43,00:23:45,you would use cotton balls.
00:23:45,00:23:45,- Yes.
00:23:45,00:23:47,- That's right.
00:23:47,00:23:48,"- Whenever you wear makeup,"
00:23:48,00:23:50,you basically continue to wear makeup
00:23:50,00:23:52,for the next two weeks until it goes off.
00:23:52,00:23:55,"- Whenever we do a photo shoot every couple of years,"
00:23:55,00:23:57,I look more and more like I've got black eyes.
00:23:57,00:23:59,(all laugh)
00:23:59,00:24:00,But another one is balloons.
00:24:00,00:24:01,I need some with a phobia of balloons.
00:24:01,00:24:02,- Oh yeah.
00:24:02,00:24:03,- And...
00:24:03,00:24:04,- Oprah Winfrey.
00:24:04,00:24:05,- Really?
00:24:05,00:24:06,"- Yeah, she's got a fear of balloons."
00:24:06,00:24:09,The popping sound reminds her of a gunshot.
00:24:09,00:24:11,"So apparently balloons are not allowed near Oprah,"
00:24:11,00:24:15,in the same way bananas are not allowed near this Swedish...
00:24:15,00:24:17,"- Well, there was one guy who has a phobia of balloons"
00:24:17,00:24:18,who had to miss his brother's wedding
00:24:18,00:24:21,'cause his brother had balloons at the wedding.
00:24:21,00:24:23,"And I just thought, as his brother,"
00:24:23,00:24:26,are you gonna insist on balloons at your wedding
00:24:26,00:24:27,or let your brother come to your wedding?
00:24:27,00:24:28,- Good point.
00:24:28,00:24:29,"I mean, balloons are not a big feature of a wedding"
00:24:29,00:24:31,unless both parties are nine years old
00:24:31,00:24:34,and it's one of those European royal weddings.
00:24:34,00:24:36,- They always get balloons at weddings.
00:24:36,00:24:38,"Every wedding that I've been to, I reckon."
00:24:38,00:24:39,"- Excuse me, James, you're at my wedding."
00:24:39,00:24:42,I challenge you to spot a single balloon in there.
00:24:42,00:24:43,(all laugh)
00:24:43,00:24:45,- James brought me this over.
00:24:45,00:24:47,- I floated in on a wicker chair.
00:24:47,00:24:49,- Stop the wedding!
00:24:49,00:24:50,(all laugh)
00:24:50,00:24:52,It should have been me!
00:24:52,00:24:54,"- But would you, if the groom had said,"
00:24:54,00:24:56,"""Listen, my brother has an extreme phobia of balloons"
00:24:56,00:24:59,"""and can't come if you have the balloons,"""
00:24:59,00:25:00,would you have gone to the trouble
00:25:00,00:25:01,of taking the balloons away?
00:25:01,00:25:02,- That's such a good point.
00:25:02,00:25:04,"Dodgy phobias, I just love this,"
00:25:04,00:25:06,"in 2014, a French government minister,"
00:25:06,00:25:10,he had failed to pay his income tax for three years
00:25:10,00:25:13,and explained it was due to administrative phobia.
00:25:14,00:25:15,(James laughs)
00:25:15,00:25:16,- Which also meant he hadn't paid rent
00:25:16,00:25:18,on his flat in Paris for three years
00:25:18,00:25:20,and he also hadn't declared a company he owned.
00:25:20,00:25:21,- You know what?
00:25:21,00:25:22,"I didn't read about that,"
00:25:22,00:25:25,but I did read about a man in Sweden
00:25:25,00:25:28,who got a load of letters saying that he'd been speeding
00:25:28,00:25:31,but had a phobia of brown envelopes.
00:25:31,00:25:33,And he got off.
00:25:33,00:25:35,"He said, ""I thought I hadn't got any warnings"
00:25:35,00:25:37,"""because I hadn't read any of my things."""
00:25:37,00:25:38,"- No, come on."
00:25:38,00:25:41,"- Well, and then I went onto the Oxford Dictionary"
00:25:41,00:25:42,of National Biography
00:25:42,00:25:44,and looked if there was any weird phobias on there.
00:25:44,00:25:46,"And I found someone called Gina Fratini,"
00:25:46,00:25:51,who was a British fashion designer in the '70s.
00:25:51,00:25:53,"And she also had a brown envelope phobia,"
00:25:53,00:25:54,according to the ODMB.
00:25:54,00:25:54,- Really?
00:25:54,00:25:56,"- So I think it is like this thing of,"
00:25:56,00:25:58,"you know, you think it's gonna be bad news all the time."
00:25:58,00:25:59,"- Well, it is bad news."
00:25:59,00:26:00,(both laugh)
00:26:00,00:26:01,- It's the tax of writing.
00:26:01,00:26:02,- You're so scared of it
00:26:02,00:26:04,that you just won't open any of the envelopes.
00:26:04,00:26:05,- Yeah.
00:26:05,00:26:07,- I can kind of see what it comes from.
00:26:07,00:26:09,"- You knew they'd arrived, hadn't you?"
00:26:09,00:26:11,So you've seen that.
00:26:11,00:26:13,What did you think was in the brown envelope?
00:26:13,00:26:16,- Couple of other famous names who have phobias.
00:26:16,00:26:19,"Macaulay Culkin, after making ""Home Alone"","
00:26:19,00:26:21,developed a phobia of leaving the house.
00:26:21,00:26:22,- Really?
00:26:22,00:26:24,"- Yeah, he had agrophobia, and that was because"
00:26:24,00:26:27,his life absolutely changed the paparazzi
00:26:27,00:26:28,"everywhere, leaping out of bushes,"
00:26:28,00:26:29,sort of following him in cars.
00:26:29,00:26:32,"He got petrified, so he needed to stay at home."
00:26:32,00:26:33,He needed to be away from everyone.
00:26:33,00:26:34,- Pretty reasonable.
00:26:34,00:26:37,"- Nile Horan from One Direction, the band,"
00:26:37,00:26:39,petrified phobia of pigeons.
00:26:39,00:26:41,"And when they're on tour,"
00:26:41,00:26:44,they have people sweep the area for pigeons
00:26:44,00:26:45,if he's going to a venue.
00:26:45,00:26:47,- You would think he would just carry
00:26:47,00:26:49,like a sparrow hawk with him wherever he went.
00:26:49,00:26:50,- Or a duckstead.
00:26:50,00:26:51,- A sparrow hawk's better.
00:26:51,00:26:53,"Sorry, that's more rock and roll."
00:26:53,00:26:54,Much more rock and roll.
00:26:54,00:26:56,I wasn't thinking about the optics.
00:26:56,00:27:01,"- On agrophobia, as you mentioned,"
00:27:01,00:27:04,"I think that was the first ever modern recorded phobia,"
00:27:04,00:27:07,"really, when psychologists started talking about phobias."
00:27:07,00:27:10,"And it was a guy called Westphal,"
00:27:10,00:27:11,who was a psychologist in the 1870s.
00:27:11,00:27:13,But people were quite obsessed with it
00:27:13,00:27:14,in the late 19th century.
00:27:14,00:27:17,"And Westphal described a patient who,"
00:27:17,00:27:19,it basically was a fear of anything
00:27:19,00:27:20,that doesn't remind them of home.
00:27:20,00:27:22,So he'd be out in a big square
00:27:22,00:27:24,and he'd have to cling to the buildings
00:27:24,00:27:25,on the way around 'cause that reminds you
00:27:25,00:27:28,of being like surrounded by your awful walls.
00:27:28,00:27:29,"And then he said, to get home,"
00:27:29,00:27:32,"if he has to get home and can't cling to the buildings,"
00:27:32,00:27:35,"then he'll either follow someone very, very closely."
00:27:35,00:27:36,"So he's like, there's another human."
00:27:36,00:27:39,Or he'll acquaint himself with a lady of the night
00:27:39,00:27:42,and begin to talk to her until she realizes
00:27:42,00:27:44,that he's not trying to get any custom.
00:27:44,00:27:46,- Officer. (laughing)
00:27:46,00:27:51,"Let me assure you, this is all a simple misunderstanding."
00:27:51,00:27:53,- Read Freud and he'll understand.
00:27:53,00:27:55,- Would he go to walk him home?
00:27:55,00:27:57,- He'd get a number of ladies of the night to walk him home.
00:27:57,00:27:59,So he'd go with a chain of things.
00:27:59,00:28:01,"- Officer, officer."
00:28:01,00:28:02,- Me again.
00:28:02,00:28:05,"- It's not an erotic conga, it's..."
00:28:05,00:28:07,(laughing)
00:28:07,00:28:15,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:28:15,00:28:16,and that is Andy.
00:28:16,00:28:18,"My fact is that after Chernobyl,"
00:28:18,00:28:21,nearby children were treated for potential radiation sickness
00:28:21,00:28:24,with compulsory hourly drinks of red wine.
00:28:24,00:28:26,"So, yeah. - Very nice, yeah."
00:28:26,00:28:29,"- This, I think, was sent in originally by Billy Vishen."
00:28:29,00:28:31,"So thank you, Billy."
00:28:31,00:28:33,"Chernobyl was in Soviet Union, now in Ukraine."
00:28:33,00:28:36,"It was a nuclear reactor, it fell over in 1986,"
00:28:36,00:28:37,had a big-- - Fell over.
00:28:37,00:28:38,"- Well, it didn't, you know what I mean."
00:28:38,00:28:40,- It fell over. - It went badly wrong.
00:28:40,00:28:41,- It went bang.
00:28:41,00:28:43,"- It went bang, it was a huge explosion,"
00:28:43,00:28:45,"and in the wake of it, obviously, lots of radiation,"
00:28:45,00:28:48,which spread all the way across a big chunk of Europe.
00:28:48,00:28:49,- Including the UK.
00:28:49,00:28:51,- Including the UK.
00:28:51,00:28:55,"And in the local area, there was a belief"
00:28:55,00:28:58,"that red wine was good for radiation sickness,"
00:28:58,00:28:59,and doctors recommended it.
00:28:59,00:29:01,And there were numerous cases of children
00:29:01,00:29:03,"who were hospitalized, not because of radiation sickness,"
00:29:03,00:29:05,but because their parents have been giving them red wine
00:29:05,00:29:07,on the hour every day.
00:29:07,00:29:08,- It wasn't just around the areas
00:29:08,00:29:10,in the whole of the Soviet Union.
00:29:10,00:29:11,"- Really, okay."
00:29:11,00:29:13,- So I spoke to my in-laws who were there at the time.
00:29:13,00:29:15,"Apparently, it was common opinion"
00:29:15,00:29:18,that alcohol helped radiation poisoning.
00:29:18,00:29:20,"And they said that actually most people,"
00:29:20,00:29:21,"as opposed to red wine,"
00:29:21,00:29:23,"they would drink something called rectified spirit,"
00:29:23,00:29:26,which is 97.2% alcohol.
00:29:26,00:29:26,"- Oof, yeah."
00:29:26,00:29:29,"- You can't actually kind of get by getting normal vodka,"
00:29:29,00:29:30,"and then distilling it, and distilling it,"
00:29:30,00:29:33,"and distilling it until it's really, really strong."
00:29:33,00:29:33,- Wow.
00:29:33,00:29:36,"- Well, the red wine connection was,"
00:29:36,00:29:38,there was a talk that went around at the time
00:29:38,00:29:42,that Soviet submarine sailors would have wine
00:29:42,00:29:44,"with all of their dinner meals while they were down there,"
00:29:44,00:29:47,and the idea was to clean the system of radiation
00:29:47,00:29:48,in the submarines.
00:29:48,00:29:49,"- Wait, so were they actually doing that?"
00:29:49,00:29:51,"Oh, that was a rumor that they did that."
00:29:51,00:29:52,"- They were definitely, I saw a menu"
00:29:52,00:29:54,"from a submarine, a Soviet submarine."
00:29:54,00:29:55,- I'm sorry.
00:29:55,00:29:55,- Incredible menu.
00:29:55,00:29:56,- Really?
00:29:56,00:29:59,"- Yeah, I wasn't aware there were menus."
00:29:59,00:30:00,- Yeah.
00:30:00,00:30:01,"- Okay, you're in it."
00:30:01,00:30:02,- As you sit down.
00:30:02,00:30:03,- Do you have anything a bit further away
00:30:03,00:30:05,"from the reactor, please?"
00:30:05,00:30:06,(all laughing)
00:30:06,00:30:08,"- I ought to be ill, but it escaped."
00:30:08,00:30:11,(all laughing)
00:30:11,00:30:12,- Wow.
00:30:12,00:30:14,"- Yeah, and you would have a ration of red wine"
00:30:14,00:30:16,for most dinner meals of most of the week.
00:30:16,00:30:17,"So, yeah, so rumor went around that."
00:30:17,00:30:19,- And was that because of radiation?
00:30:19,00:30:21,"- Who knows, but that was what, yeah,"
00:30:21,00:30:24,"according to people who lived in Chernobyl at the time,"
00:30:24,00:30:24,who recounted stories.
00:30:24,00:30:27,"- And of course, we now know that actually it does help."
00:30:27,00:30:30,"- Yes, bizarrely, it seems to have been a study,"
00:30:30,00:30:32,"hasn't there, that sort of proved it."
00:30:32,00:30:33,"- Yeah, a bit."
00:30:33,00:30:34,- A study from the University of Pittsburgh
00:30:34,00:30:38,School of Medicine in 2008 found that something called
00:30:38,00:30:42,"resveratol, which is an antioxidant found in red wine,"
00:30:42,00:30:44,may offer protection against radiation.
00:30:44,00:30:48,"It helps cells, you got some cells in a Petri dish,"
00:30:48,00:30:50,"then it helps them against radiation,"
00:30:50,00:30:53,but it didn't help mice when they tried it on mice.
00:30:53,00:30:55,"- Oh, I thought we did help some of the mice."
00:30:55,00:30:59,"- No, there was something called acetyl resveratol,"
00:30:59,00:31:02,"which is like the previous thing that I tried to pronounce,"
00:31:02,00:31:04,"but has got acetyl at the start of it,"
00:31:04,00:31:05,and that does help mice.
00:31:05,00:31:05,"- Right, okay."
00:31:05,00:31:07,"- But the thing that you get in red wine on its own,"
00:31:07,00:31:08,doesn't.
00:31:08,00:31:11,"- And also, as they said, it was a really funny thing"
00:31:11,00:31:14,to report because journalism is mad.
00:31:14,00:31:17,"Every headline, red wine can be,"
00:31:17,00:31:19,"like the telegraph headline literally was,"
00:31:19,00:31:22,red wine can protect against radiation.
00:31:22,00:31:24,Scientists may soon recommend that it is best you start
00:31:24,00:31:26,drinking heavily if exposed.
00:31:26,00:31:28,All of them saying it will protect you.
00:31:28,00:31:30,- The scientist who did the study was very clear.
00:31:30,00:31:33,He said that the dosage you would need to get enough
00:31:33,00:31:35,to help you with any kind of radiation sickness
00:31:35,00:31:37,would be 720 bottles of wine.
00:31:37,00:31:38,"- Yeah, right."
00:31:38,00:31:40,"- It's pretty amazing, all the stuff that happened"
00:31:40,00:31:43,just after Chernobyl had the moment
00:31:43,00:31:47,where everyone in the government was trying to downplay it
00:31:47,00:31:48,"within the Soviet Union, trying to say,"
00:31:48,00:31:50,"""Oh, it's not as bad as it seems."""
00:31:50,00:31:51,So I've read this amazing article
00:31:51,00:31:54,"by a lady called Natalia Charakova,"
00:31:54,00:31:56,who spoke about being there and what it was like
00:31:56,00:31:58,and all the things that were being done.
00:31:58,00:32:01,She was saying that experts were going up onto TV
00:32:01,00:32:03,"just saying, ""You know what, actually,"
00:32:03,00:32:05,"""small doses of radiation are really beneficial"
00:32:05,00:32:06,"""we found in rat health."""
00:32:06,00:32:07,"And so actually, this is--"
00:32:07,00:32:10,"- God, it's like the study for a white, wow."
00:32:10,00:32:12,- So it's not actually gonna be too bad for you.
00:32:12,00:32:14,- Like that happened in the US as well
00:32:14,00:32:17,after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
00:32:17,00:32:21,There were 132 news items in the New York Times
00:32:21,00:32:23,about the bombings and not a single one
00:32:23,00:32:25,mentioned anything about the radiation.
00:32:25,00:32:28,And there were 15 articles in the 10 months
00:32:28,00:32:31,"after the blast that mentioned radiation at all,"
00:32:31,00:32:33,and they all said there are some medical
00:32:33,00:32:36,and biological benefits to be gained from radiation.
00:32:36,00:32:37,"And the other thing is Oppenheimer said,"
00:32:37,00:32:39,"""There is every reason to believe"
00:32:39,00:32:41,"""that there was no appreciable radio activity"
00:32:41,00:32:43,"""on the ground in Hiroshima."""
00:32:43,00:32:45,"So he was just like, ""Oh, no, it's all fine."""
00:32:45,00:32:46,"""Yeah, no, we just blew them up."""
00:32:46,00:32:49,"- Gosh, at Chernobyl when it happened,"
00:32:49,00:32:51,"they flew over in helicopters,"
00:32:51,00:32:54,"they dropped 5,000 tons of sand and lead and clay"
00:32:54,00:32:57,"on top of the fire to snuff it out, basically,"
00:32:57,00:32:59,to stop the rest of it.
00:32:59,00:33:00,'Cause only a small amount of the radioactive material
00:33:00,00:33:03,in Chernobyl actually was in this explosion.
00:33:03,00:33:06,"And so the impetus was to put out that fire,"
00:33:06,00:33:07,which they managed to do.
00:33:07,00:33:09,"'Cause if the rest of it had gone up,"
00:33:09,00:33:11,"Europe might've become uninhabitable, basically."
00:33:11,00:33:12,"- Yeah, wow."
00:33:12,00:33:13,"- Yeah, and it worked."
00:33:13,00:33:14,"I mean, what they, you know."
00:33:14,00:33:16,"- It worked eventually, although I didn't realize"
00:33:16,00:33:19,"that the sound, the dumping in the first three days"
00:33:19,00:33:22,"was almost completely ineffectual, the sound and boron."
00:33:22,00:33:25,So they dumped lots of sand to try and put out the fires
00:33:25,00:33:28,and the boron was to counteract the radioactivity.
00:33:28,00:33:30,But I read the opening in the roof
00:33:30,00:33:33,where they were trying to get it was really small
00:33:33,00:33:35,and basically all the sand missed it at first.
00:33:35,00:33:36,"And also when you dump sand,"
00:33:36,00:33:37,you picture it going down in a big lump.
00:33:37,00:33:39,"I hadn't thought about it, but when you dump sand,"
00:33:39,00:33:41,it all like scatters out in the air
00:33:41,00:33:42,and sort of ends up floating down.
00:33:42,00:33:44,- They should've put more water in it.
00:33:44,00:33:46,"- Should've made wet sand, didn't they?"
00:33:46,00:33:47,"- Oh, big hourglass."
00:33:47,00:33:50,"I'm sorry to have some creative thinking here,"
00:33:50,00:33:52,"but you know, that funnels it, doesn't it?"
00:33:52,00:33:53,- Yeah.
00:33:53,00:33:54,"- Oh, you mean the top half of an hourglass?"
00:33:54,00:33:56,"- Yeah, I wouldn't have the whole hourglass."
00:33:56,00:33:57,"- Yeah, it just goes up and down."
00:33:57,00:33:59,- Or gigantic sandcastle bucket
00:33:59,00:34:01,where you just lower the sand on top
00:34:01,00:34:03,and just build a lot of good solutions.
00:34:03,00:34:06,- The interesting thing about the hourglass
00:34:06,00:34:08,"is you can have as big an hourglass as you want,"
00:34:08,00:34:11,but the little funnel bit has to be the same size
00:34:11,00:34:13,'cause it has to be the size of a grain of sand.
00:34:13,00:34:17,So actually you're only gonna get a tiny trickle of sand.
00:34:17,00:34:20,"- That's a good point, it will take a while."
00:34:20,00:34:22,- We're sitting in that helicopter day nine.
00:34:22,00:34:23,(both laughing)
00:34:23,00:34:25,"Andy, are we sure about this?"
00:34:25,00:34:28,- So then obviously you've got to cover this thing over.
00:34:28,00:34:30,"So they built what they called a sarcophagus,"
00:34:30,00:34:32,like this massive steel and concrete structure
00:34:32,00:34:35,"to cover the reactor, what's left of the reactor."
00:34:35,00:34:36,And I find this amazing.
00:34:36,00:34:39,The crane operators who put that sarcophagus in place
00:34:39,00:34:42,did so without ever seeing what they were doing.
00:34:42,00:34:43,- What do you mean?
00:34:43,00:34:44,- Riddle me that.
00:34:44,00:34:45,- Okay.
00:34:45,00:34:47,"- Okay, so they're in a crane"
00:34:47,00:34:49,next to this thing that's happening.
00:34:49,00:34:50,- Yep.
00:34:50,00:34:52,- They would give them blindfolds
00:34:52,00:34:54,because they weren't allowed to know where it was
00:34:54,00:34:56,and they got led away.
00:34:56,00:34:57,- Any advance on that?
00:34:57,00:34:59,(both laughing)
00:34:59,00:34:59,"- Not bad, not bad."
00:34:59,00:35:00,"- Sorry, I was thinking."
00:35:00,00:35:01,- Official secrecy.
00:35:01,00:35:04,"- Yeah, 'cause like, who's grave was it?"
00:35:04,00:35:06,Were they blindfolded everyone?
00:35:06,00:35:07,- I feel like it was Genghis Khan.
00:35:07,00:35:09,"- Yeah, or Attila, yeah."
00:35:09,00:35:10,- Yeah.
00:35:10,00:35:11,- It was nighttime.
00:35:11,00:35:13,"- Oh, that's good, that's good thinking."
00:35:13,00:35:16,"- That's actually the, did they just use a pencil?"
00:35:16,00:35:17,- Yeah.
00:35:17,00:35:18,"- Oh, I was gonna do that one, yeah."
00:35:18,00:35:21,- What it was is they were inside lead lined cabins
00:35:21,00:35:23,because the radio activity when this was being lowered
00:35:23,00:35:26,was more well known about and it was very high.
00:35:26,00:35:29,So they were following instructions over the radio.
00:35:29,00:35:31,They were basically doing pin the sarcophagus
00:35:31,00:35:32,on the reactor.
00:35:32,00:35:33,- Wow.
00:35:33,00:35:34,- Like they were getting instructions
00:35:34,00:35:36,from people who were observing from a long distance.
00:35:36,00:35:36,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:35:36,00:35:37,- And they just were doing it blind.
00:35:37,00:35:39,"- Left, left, no, mine left, no, mine left."
00:35:39,00:35:41,(both laughing)
00:35:41,00:35:43,"- Okay, we're gonna need another sarcophagus now."
00:35:43,00:35:45,"- Well, they did put a second one on in the end, didn't they?"
00:35:45,00:35:46,- They did.
00:35:46,00:35:47,"- In fact, this is something we talked about"
00:35:47,00:35:49,"on No. 6 Things in the News, our short-lived TV show."
00:35:49,00:35:50,- Oh yeah.
00:35:50,00:35:51,- Yeah.
00:35:51,00:35:52,- 'Cause I think it was around that time
00:35:52,00:35:55,when they put a new big bit of concrete over it
00:35:55,00:35:57,and it was like the biggest dome
00:35:57,00:35:58,that had ever been created.
00:35:58,00:35:59,- Is it concrete?
00:35:59,00:36:00,"I thought it was, one of them was steel, right?"
00:36:00,00:36:02,'Cause I felt like the first one was concrete
00:36:02,00:36:03,and that got dilapidated
00:36:03,00:36:05,and then they have now made this steel dome
00:36:05,00:36:08,which I think is gonna last 100 years-ish.
00:36:08,00:36:09,But it still feels like you're gonna have to set an alarm
00:36:09,00:36:11,for 100 years time when you've forgotten about it.
00:36:11,00:36:12,"- It's just snoozing, isn't it, basically?"
00:36:12,00:36:13,- Yeah.
00:36:13,00:36:15,"- 'Cause it basically, it's Chernobyl turned into"
00:36:15,00:36:17,basically a giant Russian doll.
00:36:17,00:36:18,- Oh.
00:36:18,00:36:20,"- It's just bigger and bigger, yeah."
00:36:20,00:36:22,"- Massive Ukrainian doll, we should say."
00:36:22,00:36:23,"- Yeah, Ukrainian doll."
00:36:23,00:36:25,"You can now, given that we're talking about alcohol"
00:36:25,00:36:28,"at Chernobyl, you can get a drink called Atomic"
00:36:28,00:36:30,"and I've ordered some of this, I love this."
00:36:30,00:36:33,It's harvested from apples from abandoned orchards
00:36:33,00:36:36,"in the local area, all of which are now producing apples"
00:36:36,00:36:39,which are very low in radiation.
00:36:39,00:36:41,So it's completely safe for consumption
00:36:41,00:36:43,and it goes to funding local bits of Ukraine
00:36:43,00:36:45,"which have been, you know, severely hammered"
00:36:45,00:36:47,"not only by the nuclear reactor going off,"
00:36:47,00:36:48,but also by the war.
00:36:48,00:36:51,"And it's still being made and distributed, I believe, so."
00:36:51,00:36:51,"- That's good, I know."
00:36:51,00:36:54,"- I think it's you don't drink vodka, so."
00:36:54,00:36:55,- I'm gonna try.
00:36:55,00:36:55,- But good on you.
00:36:55,00:36:56,"- I'm gonna have a bag of apples,"
00:36:56,00:36:57,it might be more like snaps.
00:36:57,00:36:59,"- It's exactly, I think it is actually."
00:36:59,00:37:00,I think it's basically snaps.
00:37:00,00:37:02,- Is it an apple sour?
00:37:02,00:37:04,"- Yeah, it's an apple very sour, yeah."
00:37:04,00:37:07,"- It's amazing the fallout, how far it did travel."
00:37:07,00:37:09,Like they have found a little layer
00:37:09,00:37:12,"of radioactive materials at the bottom of Loch Ness,"
00:37:12,00:37:13,"for example, which has come."
00:37:13,00:37:14,- Here we go.
00:37:14,00:37:15,"- Hey, listen, I can't."
00:37:15,00:37:16,- Did the Beatles find it?
00:37:16,00:37:17,My only chance.
00:37:17,00:37:22,- They were in a yellow submarine on the menu each night.
00:37:22,00:37:25,"- But no, do you know what's interesting?"
00:37:25,00:37:27,Talking earlier about the sort of the experts
00:37:27,00:37:30,coming on and trying to downplay it.
00:37:30,00:37:32,"As a result, people sort of started thinking,"
00:37:32,00:37:34,"actually, this might not be true."
00:37:34,00:37:35,"And according to Natalia,"
00:37:35,00:37:37,whose article I read about the experience
00:37:37,00:37:38,"of living there at the time,"
00:37:38,00:37:41,"she said everyone started experiencing radiophobia,"
00:37:41,00:37:43,like her grandmother used to put iodine in her meals
00:37:43,00:37:46,"just to make sure that, yeah."
00:37:46,00:37:48,"Then also parents were just,"
00:37:48,00:37:49,"if they couldn't get out from where they were,"
00:37:49,00:37:51,we're just putting their kids onto trains
00:37:51,00:37:54,"with their names, and this is my name,"
00:37:54,00:37:56,"please look after me and just saying, go."
00:37:56,00:37:57,"And they sent them out in further away,"
00:37:57,00:37:58,in further away.
00:37:58,00:38:00,"- 'Cause these weren't people in the exclusion zone,"
00:38:00,00:38:02,'cause the exclusion zone was completely evacuated.
00:38:02,00:38:03,But people who were just close enough
00:38:03,00:38:05,"that they thought, I'm really scared now."
00:38:05,00:38:06,"- Yeah, it just spread around there."
00:38:06,00:38:07,Like how far did this travel?
00:38:07,00:38:08,- A lot of people in the UK were scared as well.
00:38:08,00:38:09,It's in all the newspapers.
00:38:09,00:38:12,"I probably would have been quite scared, yeah."
00:38:12,00:38:13,- I got one of the letters that was sent out
00:38:13,00:38:15,to people living in the local area at the time.
00:38:15,00:38:16,"It's really interesting the phrasing,"
00:38:16,00:38:18,'cause they're trying to persuade people
00:38:18,00:38:19,"to take some precautions,"
00:38:19,00:38:21,"but also trying to say, it's all fine."
00:38:21,00:38:24,"So the letter begins, dear comrades, positive."
00:38:24,00:38:26,The result of detailed analysis showed
00:38:26,00:38:27,that living and working in your village
00:38:27,00:38:29,will cause no harm to adults or children.
00:38:29,00:38:30,Great news.
00:38:30,00:38:32,"And then it said, we've got a few tips."
00:38:32,00:38:35,Do not eat berries and mushrooms gathered this year.
00:38:35,00:38:37,Children should not enter the forest.
00:38:37,00:38:38,Limit fresh greens.
00:38:38,00:38:39,Remove topsoil from the garden
00:38:39,00:38:41,and bury it in specially prepared graves
00:38:41,00:38:42,far from the village.
00:38:42,00:38:43,"But apart from that, you're all fine."
00:38:43,00:38:45,"- I think mushrooms like are particularly bad, aren't they?"
00:38:45,00:38:48,'Cause they sort of get the nutrients from the soil
00:38:48,00:38:49,and they can't really.
00:38:49,00:38:50,- Now.
00:38:50,00:38:51,- Is that not true?
00:38:51,00:38:53,- Is this where your mushroom thing comes from?
00:38:53,00:38:54,"- Oh, maybe."
00:38:54,00:38:57,- You look at a mushroom and you see radiation.
00:38:57,00:38:58,You were alive at the time.
00:38:58,00:38:59,It was in the news.
00:38:59,00:39:00,"- It's true, it's true."
00:39:00,00:39:01,- There might have been a triggering incident.
00:39:01,00:39:02,- Could have been.
00:39:02,00:39:04,"That's usually the case, isn't it?"
00:39:04,00:39:04,"That's what they all say,"
00:39:04,00:39:06,that these people who are scared of bananas
00:39:06,00:39:08,must have had some terrible bananas.
00:39:08,00:39:09,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:39:09,00:39:10,- There was a woman who was electrocuted
00:39:10,00:39:13,while looking at a bowl of bananas.
00:39:13,00:39:14,"Sorry, it's not funny."
00:39:14,00:39:14,It's not funny.
00:39:14,00:39:15,- No.
00:39:15,00:39:16,"- Like, got an electric shock."
00:39:16,00:39:17,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:39:17,00:39:18,- Electrocuted.
00:39:18,00:39:19,- Electrified.
00:39:19,00:39:20,"- Well, she wasn't,"
00:39:20,00:39:21,she didn't convert to run on electricity.
00:39:21,00:39:23,(laughing)
00:39:23,00:39:25,It's a word we haven't worked out yet.
00:39:25,00:39:26,- Have you guys heard about this?
00:39:26,00:39:27,Many things about this.
00:39:27,00:39:30,"Samosally, they're the people who chose to return."
00:39:30,00:39:33,"So about 1,200 people, after they're evacuated,"
00:39:33,00:39:34,"decided, you know what?"
00:39:34,00:39:36,My home's Chernobyl or the surrounding area.
00:39:36,00:39:37,I'm going back.
00:39:37,00:39:40,And they went back and a couple of years that followed.
00:39:40,00:39:42,"- Wow, like two, three years after."
00:39:42,00:39:44,- Like some of them went back months after.
00:39:44,00:39:45,A lot of them did.
00:39:45,00:39:47,And there are about 200 of them left.
00:39:47,00:39:48,And it's fascinating
00:39:48,00:39:51,'cause they're spread across about 164 villages.
00:39:51,00:39:54,So there were just over one person per village.
00:39:54,00:39:56,And they live extraordinary lives.
00:39:56,00:39:58,I was reading an interview with one called Ivan
00:39:58,00:40:00,who was remembering the time
00:40:00,00:40:02,"and said that, you know, they weren't really scared."
00:40:02,00:40:03,He remembered going and handing alcohol
00:40:03,00:40:06,to everyone there 'cause they all knew it would cure them.
00:40:06,00:40:08,And he lives in a village with two other women.
00:40:08,00:40:10,"The journalist said, do you ever see them?"
00:40:10,00:40:12,"And he said, no, we almost never socialize."
00:40:12,00:40:14,"- I'm really sorry to say this, but sitcom?"
00:40:14,00:40:19,I know I say it all the time
00:40:19,00:40:21,when something like this terrible thing happens.
00:40:21,00:40:22,- But you think this is the one?
00:40:22,00:40:23,"- I mean, one guy and two women"
00:40:23,00:40:25,living in a village on the road
00:40:25,00:40:27,and they never like to speak to each other.
00:40:27,00:40:30,- It's a recipe for comedy.
00:40:31,00:40:34,"- Did you see Bionerd, 23?"
00:40:34,00:40:34,- What's that?
00:40:34,00:40:37,- She's someone who had a YouTube channel
00:40:37,00:40:39,and she made over 60 videos of her
00:40:39,00:40:40,going in the exclusion zone.
00:40:40,00:40:43,And she would do things like pick apples off a tree
00:40:43,00:40:44,and take a bite into them.
00:40:44,00:40:45,But she was also a scientist.
00:40:45,00:40:47,And so she would show you that it was safe.
00:40:47,00:40:50,"But she hasn't posted, I think, in about five years now."
00:40:50,00:40:51,And she never gave her name
00:40:51,00:40:53,and no one really knows who she is.
00:40:53,00:40:54,So we don't know what's happened to her.
00:40:54,00:40:58,But she's a legit sort of YouTuber from back in the day.
00:40:58,00:40:59,"- A legit YouTuber, what is a legit YouTuber?"
00:40:59,00:41:00,"- Well, she was a scientist"
00:41:00,00:41:03,who was trying to show you that it's changed.
00:41:03,00:41:03,"- Yeah, legit."
00:41:03,00:41:05,- 'Cause a legit YouTuber is just someone
00:41:05,00:41:06,who has a camera on their phone.
00:41:06,00:41:07,"- There it is, yeah."
00:41:07,00:41:08,- So everyone apart from you.
00:41:08,00:41:11,(all laughing)
00:41:11,00:41:13,There are a lot of dogs around Chernobyl today.
00:41:13,00:41:17,And they're genetically distinct from dogs
00:41:17,00:41:19,that are just about 10 or 20 miles away.
00:41:19,00:41:21,- Is that just they've mated with each other?
00:41:21,00:41:21,They've got their own clan.
00:41:21,00:41:23,And so they've become a little different.
00:41:23,00:41:23,- It honestly is that.
00:41:23,00:41:26,It's just they've kept themselves to themselves.
00:41:26,00:41:29,And the other dogs have kept themselves to themselves.
00:41:29,00:41:30,And they've lived apart for long enough
00:41:30,00:41:32,that they have genetic markers
00:41:32,00:41:33,that are different between the two dogs now.
00:41:33,00:41:34,- Do they?
00:41:34,00:41:35,"- Wow, that's incredible."
00:41:35,00:41:36,- That's interesting.
00:41:36,00:41:38,"'Cause they're basically survivors of the cull, aren't they?"
00:41:38,00:41:39,"When one of the less,"
00:41:39,00:41:41,"well, all the jobs are quite unpleasant after it,"
00:41:41,00:41:43,but a specific police squad were sent in
00:41:43,00:41:46,to kill all the pets that were left in Chernobyl
00:41:46,00:41:48,so that they didn't go and spread.
00:41:48,00:41:50,- The idea is perhaps there was something about them
00:41:50,00:41:53,that made them able to survive the cull.
00:41:53,00:41:55,And that's like a slightly genetic difference
00:41:55,00:41:57,"that has them, you know."
00:41:57,00:41:58,- Wow.
00:41:58,00:42:01,- The ability to hide under a sofa.
00:42:01,00:42:02,- But that's the same.
00:42:02,00:42:05,All the frogs around there are now black.
00:42:05,00:42:06,And this is very weird.
00:42:06,00:42:08,It's 'cause initially slightly darker frogs
00:42:08,00:42:10,were slightly likely to survive the radiation.
00:42:10,00:42:13,"And this is how long ago, nearly 40 years now,"
00:42:13,00:42:15,which is 10 to 15 frog generations.
00:42:15,00:42:18,So they have observed micro evolution even in this time.
00:42:18,00:42:20,"And darker ones in the exclusion zone,"
00:42:20,00:42:21,the frogs are all black now.
00:42:21,00:42:25,- I've read recently that gray squirrels are turning black.
00:42:25,00:42:26,- Is that so?
00:42:26,00:42:27,- We've got black squirrels around us.
00:42:27,00:42:28,And I always wonder what the hell they're doing there.
00:42:28,00:42:31,"- Well, apparently they are more likely to survive"
00:42:31,00:42:35,if they're dark because it means they can hide.
00:42:35,00:42:36,- I don't know what they blend in with.
00:42:36,00:42:38,"- That's a bit depressing, isn't it?"
00:42:38,00:42:39,- I read that in a study this week.
00:42:39,00:42:41,"So actually, I just read the headline."
00:42:41,00:42:43,I haven't read the study yet.
00:42:43,00:42:44,- The hang on concrete is gray.
00:42:44,00:42:46,I would have thought gray squirrel or gray concrete
00:42:46,00:42:47,is perfect for them.
00:42:47,00:42:49,"- And then you'll come, you get run over."
00:42:49,00:42:52,Black squirrel used to stand out.
00:42:52,00:42:53,"- And is that why, do they want to stand out?"
00:42:53,00:42:55,- I really wish I'd read this article now.
00:42:55,00:42:57,"- No, it feels like it would have helped us a lot."
00:42:57,00:42:58,"- That's just what you're like wildly,"
00:42:58,00:43:00,it's what Dan's all the podcast is.
00:43:00,00:43:03,(upbeat music)
00:43:03,00:43:08,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show."
00:43:08,00:43:09,And that is my fact.
00:43:09,00:43:13,"My fact this week is that the song ""Take Me Home Country Roads"""
00:43:13,00:43:16,was written by three people who had never been
00:43:16,00:43:17,to West Virginia.
00:43:17,00:43:20,Take Me Out to the Ball Game was written by two people
00:43:20,00:43:23,who had never been to a ball game.
00:43:23,00:43:26,And the Pina Collada song was written by one person
00:43:26,00:43:27,who had never drunk one.
00:43:27,00:43:28,- Lovely.
00:43:28,00:43:29,- A lot of this makes sense.
00:43:29,00:43:31,"I mean, the reason you want to be taken to a ball game"
00:43:31,00:43:32,'cause you've never been to one.
00:43:32,00:43:33,"- Oh, that's true."
00:43:33,00:43:34,"- That holds together, doesn't it?"
00:43:34,00:43:36,"- But on the other hand, ""Take Me Home"""
00:43:36,00:43:38,"to West Virginia. - Doesn't play, yeah."
00:43:38,00:43:40,- That's tougher.
00:43:40,00:43:42,- So that famously is a John Denver song written
00:43:42,00:43:46,"by three people, Bill Danoff, Taffy Nivert and John Denver."
00:43:46,00:43:48,The first two were in a band before
00:43:48,00:43:51,"and Danoff wrote that song ""Afternoon Delight"","
00:43:51,00:43:52,if you know that.
00:43:52,00:43:53,- My rock is in flight.
00:43:53,00:43:54,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:43:54,00:43:57,"If you've seen ""Anchorman"", you'll know that movie."
00:43:57,00:43:58,"Sorry, you'll know that song."
00:43:58,00:44:01,"But yeah, so they were riding around in their car"
00:44:01,00:44:04,"on Clopper Road in Montgomery County, Maryland."
00:44:04,00:44:06,And they had an idea for this song.
00:44:06,00:44:07,But it didn't scan.
00:44:07,00:44:09,"- ""Take Me Home"", Clopper Road."
00:44:09,00:44:11,(all laughing)
00:44:11,00:44:12,"- Yeah, it didn't scan."
00:44:12,00:44:14,And they were writing the lyrics one night
00:44:14,00:44:17,and John Denver happened to come over to their house
00:44:17,00:44:18,having busted his thumb
00:44:18,00:44:20,and gone to emergency hospital surgery.
00:44:20,00:44:23,He was sitting with them in their house early in the morning.
00:44:23,00:44:25,They'd planned to sell it to Johnny Cash.
00:44:25,00:44:26,And he started hearing the song.
00:44:26,00:44:27,"He thought, ""This is incredible."""
00:44:27,00:44:29,And they stayed up all night writing the song.
00:44:29,00:44:31,"And because none of them had been to West Virginia,"
00:44:31,00:44:33,they got an encyclopedia down
00:44:33,00:44:34,and they had to look up all the details
00:44:34,00:44:37,in order to make the lyrics work.
00:44:37,00:44:37,"- Is the rest of the song,"
00:44:37,00:44:40,does it show an encyclopedic knowledge of West Virginia?
00:44:40,00:44:40,'Cause I've come over.
00:44:40,00:44:43,"- Full violation, 384,000."
00:44:43,00:44:46,(all laughing)
00:44:46,00:44:51,- I heard that they basically liked the scanning
00:44:51,00:44:54,of Blue Ridge Mountains and Shenador River
00:44:54,00:44:54,and stuff like that.
00:44:54,00:44:56,They like these phrases.
00:44:56,00:44:59,And that's kind of why they went for West Virginia.
00:44:59,00:45:00,- 'Cause those are the famous bits.
00:45:00,00:45:01,"If you just do the main population centers,"
00:45:01,00:45:03,it's probably gonna be less romantic.
00:45:03,00:45:06,"- Yeah, but also they were gonna use Massachusetts"
00:45:06,00:45:08,'cause it's got four syllables as well.
00:45:08,00:45:10,Just looking for something with four syllables in it.
00:45:10,00:45:12,"- Right, West Virginia, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:45:12,00:45:14,What about this ball game thing?
00:45:14,00:45:15,"- Oh, the ball game?"
00:45:15,00:45:18,"- Well, ball game, that was written in 1908"
00:45:18,00:45:20,and that was written by a guy called Jack Norworth
00:45:20,00:45:23,"and he wrote the lyrics and he brought the song,"
00:45:23,00:45:25,the lyrics to this guy called Albert von Tilzer
00:45:25,00:45:27,and he put it to the tune that we now know it as.
00:45:27,00:45:30,Both of them had never been to a game before.
00:45:30,00:45:33,They would only go one of them 32 years later
00:45:33,00:45:36,after writing the song and then the other 20 years later
00:45:36,00:45:38,"after writing the song, but it became popular"
00:45:38,00:45:40,because it was an incredible announcer
00:45:40,00:45:42,for the Chicago White Sox.
00:45:42,00:45:44,He would announce their games called Harry Carrie.
00:45:45,00:45:46,Who used to sing it?
00:45:46,00:45:47,"- We should just say that this is,"
00:45:47,00:45:49,"if you go to a baseball game,"
00:45:49,00:45:51,they play it at every baseball game in America.
00:45:51,00:45:53,So that's why it's kind of famous.
00:45:53,00:45:55,- It's massive and they play it at the same point
00:45:55,00:45:56,as well as during the Seventh Innings.
00:45:56,00:45:58,- I don't think I know it.
00:45:58,00:45:59,Is it like the equivalent of like--
00:45:59,00:46:01,- I like thinking British people wouldn't know it.
00:46:01,00:46:01,- I don't know.
00:46:01,00:46:04,♪ Take me out to the ball game ♪
00:46:04,00:46:05,"- Wow, really?"
00:46:05,00:46:06,- British people would not know that song.
00:46:06,00:46:08,- It's just in so many American movies and--
00:46:08,00:46:10,"- Is it the equivalent of the rare,"
00:46:10,00:46:12,"the referee, the wanker?"
00:46:12,00:46:12,"- That's it, yeah."
00:46:12,00:46:14,"- It was their follow-up, it's just--"
00:46:14,00:46:15,- That was actually written by a man
00:46:15,00:46:17,who had never masturbated.
00:46:17,00:46:19,(all laughing)
00:46:19,00:46:21,- A lot of people look back on this song now
00:46:21,00:46:23,"because most people don't know the lyrics to the song,"
00:46:23,00:46:24,certainly the first verse.
00:46:24,00:46:25,"They just know ""Take me out."""
00:46:25,00:46:27,"They know the main chorus, which is sung."
00:46:27,00:46:29,But it's pushed as a really progressive song
00:46:29,00:46:30,for women at the time.
00:46:30,00:46:33,"And this was a result of he based it on,"
00:46:33,00:46:35,he was having an affair at the time
00:46:35,00:46:36,with two vaudeville characters.
00:46:36,00:46:41,"- His main girlfriend was someone called Trixie Fraganza,"
00:46:41,00:46:42,who's also a bit--
00:46:42,00:46:44,"- Sorry, Trixie, but not a real name."
00:46:44,00:46:47,"- Before you say so, she was an outspoken suffragist"
00:46:47,00:46:49,as well as a vaudeville.
00:46:49,00:46:50,"- No good honest, incredible."
00:46:50,00:46:51,"- Sounds like a suffragist's name,"
00:46:51,00:46:53,"doesn't it, Trixie Fraganza?"
00:46:53,00:46:57,"But she had, her most famous act was striptease,"
00:46:57,00:47:00,where every time it looked like she was gonna take off
00:47:00,00:47:02,"an item of clothing, she did,"
00:47:02,00:47:02,but you never saw anything
00:47:02,00:47:05,'cause there was always more clothing underneath.
00:47:05,00:47:06,"She would just keep going,"
00:47:06,00:47:07,and there'd be more and more and more clothes.
00:47:07,00:47:10,- She's covered in layers of suffragist pamphlets.
00:47:10,00:47:10,- Yes.
00:47:10,00:47:13,- But it's pushed as a really progressive song
00:47:13,00:47:14,for women at the time.
00:47:14,00:47:16,And this was a result of him basing it on Trixie.
00:47:16,00:47:20,So the lyrics basically say she was baseball mad.
00:47:20,00:47:21,"This was a time, 1908,"
00:47:21,00:47:23,"where women weren't going to baseball,"
00:47:23,00:47:24,"and it was, so it was a real push."
00:47:24,00:47:25,- Cool. - It was good.
00:47:25,00:47:27,- Go Trixie. - Aggressive.
00:47:27,00:47:28,- I won't hear a word against her.
00:47:28,00:47:29,"- Okay, what was the last one?"
00:47:29,00:47:31,"- Oh, Pina Colada. - Pina Colada."
00:47:31,00:47:32,"- Yeah, I love this."
00:47:32,00:47:33,"- Yeah, well, do you wanna take over, Andy?"
00:47:33,00:47:38,"- Well, so Rupert Holmes from Northwich in Cheshire?"
00:47:38,00:47:39,- Really? - Yeah.
00:47:39,00:47:40,- Who wrote the Pina Colada song?
00:47:40,00:47:42,"- He wrote the Pina Colada song, Northwich."
00:47:42,00:47:43,- Lovely part of the world.
00:47:43,00:47:44,- Is it? I've never been.
00:47:44,00:47:45,- No.
00:47:45,00:47:48,"- Well, it now has a Pina Colada festival every year."
00:47:48,00:47:49,- It does.
00:47:49,00:47:50,- And he had never had one.
00:47:50,00:47:52,And also it wasn't meant to be Pina Colada in the song.
00:47:52,00:47:56,"Initially when he was writing it, it was Humphrey Bogart."
00:47:56,00:47:57,- Yeah.
00:47:57,00:47:59,- If you like Humphrey Bogart.
00:47:59,00:48:02,- If you like Humphrey Bogart.
00:48:02,00:48:04,"- Yeah, you would have to say Humphrey Bogart."
00:48:04,00:48:05,"- No, I think you can go,"
00:48:05,00:48:07,if you like Humphrey Bogart.
00:48:07,00:48:11,"- No, guys, if you like Humphrey Bogart, that's easy."
00:48:11,00:48:13,- If you like Humphrey Bogart.
00:48:13,00:48:15,"- But so yeah, he just thought,"
00:48:15,00:48:17,what is a nice sounding drink?
00:48:17,00:48:18,He had never had it.
00:48:18,00:48:21,"And the sales were terrible of the song at first,"
00:48:21,00:48:22,despite the song being mega popular.
00:48:22,00:48:24,"So it's a great, it's a brilliant song."
00:48:24,00:48:27,It's about this guy who's bored of his lady.
00:48:27,00:48:28,And he posts--
00:48:28,00:48:30,- Are you gonna spoil a Pina Colada song now?
00:48:30,00:48:32,- I think I am actually.
00:48:32,00:48:33,He reads an advert in the newspaper.
00:48:33,00:48:34,- If you're halfway through listening
00:48:34,00:48:38,"to the Pina Colada song, just turn off now."
00:48:38,00:48:40,"- He reads this advert in the newspaper saying,"
00:48:40,00:48:42,"if you like Pina Colada and getting caught in the rain,"
00:48:42,00:48:45,"if you blah, blah, blah, blah, then, you know,"
00:48:45,00:48:46,let's get together.
00:48:46,00:48:49,And then he turns up and it's his wife.
00:48:49,00:48:51,They realize they did love each other.
00:48:51,00:48:54,"They are compatible, but anyway, whatever."
00:48:54,00:48:55,- What a lovely story.
00:48:55,00:48:56,"- And the thing is, come with me and escape."
00:48:56,00:48:58,And the song is called Escape.
00:48:58,00:49:00,And everyone was listening on the radio.
00:49:00,00:49:01,The radio fans were going nuts for it.
00:49:01,00:49:03,"DJs were playing it all the time,"
00:49:03,00:49:05,but no one was buying it 'cause they could not remember
00:49:05,00:49:06,the name of the song.
00:49:06,00:49:07,- Oh my God.
00:49:07,00:49:08,- It was what's that song?
00:49:08,00:49:09,"It's the, oh, you know, the Pina Colada song."
00:49:09,00:49:10,And then his record label--
00:49:10,00:49:11,- How helpful were shopkeepers in those days?
00:49:11,00:49:14,"If you went in and said, what's the song about Pina Colada?"
00:49:14,00:49:15,"And they're like, what's the seal?"
00:49:15,00:49:17,"- Nope, nope, never heard of that."
00:49:17,00:49:18,Nope.
00:49:18,00:49:20,"- And his record label put,"
00:49:20,00:49:24,his record label put on escape brackets of the Pina Colada song.
00:49:24,00:49:26,"- I just love the idea of him saying,"
00:49:26,00:49:28,"unless you say the exact correct name,"
00:49:28,00:49:29,I'm not gonna get it.
00:49:29,00:49:31,- A lot of record shots were starved
00:49:31,00:49:33,by Rumpelstiltskin in those days.
00:49:33,00:49:35,(both laughing)
00:49:35,00:49:36,"But the record label added those brackets,"
00:49:36,00:49:38,"literally escape brackets, the Pina Colada song,"
00:49:38,00:49:40,and it went quadruple platinum.
00:49:40,00:49:42,"- Really? - It just went nuts, yeah, yeah."
00:49:42,00:49:46,"- On sort of songs that don't fit their writers,"
00:49:46,00:49:49,"which I suppose is the topic of this,"
00:49:49,00:49:50,a hard one to research.
00:49:50,00:49:53,"But the famous one really is the Barry Manilow song,"
00:49:53,00:49:56,"I Write the Songs, which he didn't write."
00:49:56,00:50:00,It was actually written by Bruce Johnson of The Beach Boys.
00:50:00,00:50:02,- Wow. - Which I hadn't realized.
00:50:02,00:50:03,And Manilow did say at the time
00:50:03,00:50:05,that he knew that he would be in trouble
00:50:05,00:50:06,as soon as his producer handed it to him.
00:50:06,00:50:08,"And he said, look, I know that I'm gonna get in shit"
00:50:08,00:50:10,for this 'cause I didn't write it.
00:50:10,00:50:12,But have you ever heard the Barry Manilow song?
00:50:12,00:50:13,I really do write the songs.
00:50:13,00:50:14,- No. (both laughing)
00:50:14,00:50:17,- It's really good. - I love a song sequel.
00:50:17,00:50:19,"- It's so good, so it's a spoof,"
00:50:19,00:50:21,"basically responding to all his critics who were saying,"
00:50:21,00:50:23,"but he didn't write, I write the songs."
00:50:23,00:50:26,And it's a manual for how to write a song.
00:50:26,00:50:29,"So it has lyrics like, you start off with the verse,"
00:50:29,00:50:30,and that's the part that tells you
00:50:30,00:50:32,what the song's gonna be about.
00:50:32,00:50:34,"And you can talk about dope or death,"
00:50:34,00:50:36,but love is probably the best.
00:50:36,00:50:37,"It's better than this, the actual lyrics."
00:50:37,00:50:38,- It does sound like they have used
00:50:38,00:50:40,an encyclopedia entry for that one.
00:50:40,00:50:42,(both laughing)
00:50:42,00:50:44,- You know the thing with I Write the Songs?
00:50:44,00:50:46,He didn't want to sing it
00:50:46,00:50:48,because he wanted to write his own songs.
00:50:48,00:50:52,And he was presented with it by his producer.
00:50:52,00:50:55,And it's the singer of the song is the spirit of music.
00:50:55,00:50:58,It's actually from the perspective of music itself.
00:50:58,00:50:59,"I write the songs, right?"
00:50:59,00:51:01,Like I'm the inspiration for the channel.
00:51:01,00:51:03,"But when he read the lyrics, he thought,"
00:51:03,00:51:04,"this just sounds like me, Barry Manilow,"
00:51:04,00:51:06,singing I write the songs.
00:51:06,00:51:07,And that's what people interpret it as.
00:51:07,00:51:08,So I don't want to do that.
00:51:08,00:51:12,"And Bruce Johnson said, no, this is God narrating the song."
00:51:12,00:51:14,- And it's gonna come off as much better
00:51:14,00:51:15,if you're speaking as God.
00:51:15,00:51:17,"- Yeah, he really didn't want to sing it"
00:51:17,00:51:19,until he was strong armed into it by his producer.
00:51:19,00:51:20,And then went to number one.
00:51:20,00:51:22,- I think he quite enjoyed it.
00:51:22,00:51:24,"As in, I think now, like doing that piss take"
00:51:24,00:51:25,that ends in the climax.
00:51:25,00:51:27,Sometimes I really do write the songs.
00:51:27,00:51:28,And he does refer to it.
00:51:28,00:51:29,I feel like he's taken it quite well.
00:51:29,00:51:32,You could have got quite pissed off about that tension.
00:51:32,00:51:34,"I'm not like Frank Sinatra actually did a version,"
00:51:34,00:51:35,which I didn't know.
00:51:35,00:51:36,And he insisted on changing the lyrics
00:51:36,00:51:39,"to I sing the songs, which I think is a bit of a cop out."
00:51:39,00:51:40,"- Yeah, it is."
00:51:40,00:51:43,- Do you guys know the song Girls Just Wanna Have Fun?
00:51:43,00:51:44,- Of course. - Love it.
00:51:44,00:51:45,Cindy Lauper.
00:51:45,00:51:47,"- Well, she didn't write it."
00:51:47,00:51:50,It was written by a man called Robert Hazard.
00:51:50,00:51:54,"And the amazing thing is not only did he write it,"
00:51:54,00:51:55,he also sang it.
00:51:55,00:51:57,And he sang the same lyrics more or less.
00:51:57,00:52:00,"It's slightly different, but they're more or less the same."
00:52:00,00:52:02,"But when you listen to them, how he sang them,"
00:52:02,00:52:04,it's got a really different meaning.
00:52:04,00:52:05,- I bet.
00:52:05,00:52:07,"- So if you think about it, my daddy said,"
00:52:07,00:52:09,"""What are you gonna do with your life?"
00:52:09,00:52:10,"""You're not the fortunate one."
00:52:10,00:52:11,"""Girls just wanna have fun."""
00:52:11,00:52:13,"What he's saying is,"
00:52:13,00:52:15,"""I'm not gonna care what I'm doing in my life."
00:52:15,00:52:17,"""I'm going out and I'm gonna sleep with a load of women"
00:52:17,00:52:19,"""because they just wanna have fun."""
00:52:19,00:52:21,- Fair enough.
00:52:21,00:52:22,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:52:22,00:52:23,But it's a different song.
00:52:23,00:52:24,- It's a very different song.
00:52:24,00:52:25,"- It's a different tone, isn't it?"
00:52:25,00:52:26,"- Yeah, yeah, definitely."
00:52:26,00:52:27,"- I think ""I'm Every Woman"""
00:52:27,00:52:29,was also largely written by a man.
00:52:29,00:52:30,- Was it?
00:52:30,00:52:31,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:52:31,00:52:33,- What do you mean largely written?
00:52:33,00:52:35,"Like, he wrote ""I'm Every Man."""
00:52:35,00:52:36,Someone had to do the WO.
00:52:36,00:52:37,"- I think it was co-written,"
00:52:37,00:52:38,but he wrote most of the lyrics.
00:52:38,00:52:39,"- Oh, really?"
00:52:39,00:52:40,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:52:40,00:52:43,- I do know that respect R-E-S-P-E-C-T.
00:52:43,00:52:45,"Indeed, Ari Frankes,"
00:52:45,00:52:48,"which was a big feminist anthem, obviously,"
00:52:48,00:52:50,and a civil rights anthem.
00:52:50,00:52:53,But that was originally written about a man
00:52:53,00:52:55,"saying, ""My wife's got to respect me"
00:52:55,00:52:58,"when I come home tired from work after a long, old day."""
00:52:58,00:53:00,And yeah.
00:53:00,00:53:01,"- Oh, wow."
00:53:01,00:53:02,- She just reclaimed it.
00:53:02,00:53:04,"- One little tweak, yeah, yeah."
00:53:04,00:53:05,- Yeah.
00:53:05,00:53:06,- My favorite one's always been that
00:53:06,00:53:08,"the song ""It Wasn't Me"" by Shaggy."
00:53:08,00:53:10,"15 years after the song was released,"
00:53:10,00:53:12,he revealed that it was in fact him.
00:53:12,00:53:14,He was the cheater in the song.
00:53:14,00:53:15,- 'Cause it's about someone cheating.
00:53:15,00:53:16,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:53:16,00:53:19,It's actually used legally now as the Shaggy defense.
00:53:19,00:53:21,- It's where you got irrefutable evidence
00:53:21,00:53:22,"that you did something and you just say,"
00:53:22,00:53:23,"""No, I didn't do it."""
00:53:23,00:53:24,"- Exactly, yeah."
00:53:24,00:53:25,The Shaggy defense.
00:53:25,00:53:26,- The toddler defense.
00:53:26,00:53:27,- It's a bad defense.
00:53:27,00:53:28,- It's a Trump defense.
00:53:28,00:53:28,"- Look at this, yeah."
00:53:28,00:53:31,"- Toto, you can guess what I'm about to say about them."
00:53:31,00:53:32,"- Africa, they've never been to Africa."
00:53:32,00:53:34,"- Yeah, and this is David Page, who wrote,"
00:53:34,00:53:36,"I was reading about, I basically thought,"
00:53:36,00:53:38,"""I bet Toto had never been to Africa."""
00:53:38,00:53:42,And I looked at Africa and they hadn't when they wrote it.
00:53:42,00:53:44,And the guy who wrote it was a member of the band
00:53:44,00:53:45,called David Page.
00:53:45,00:53:47,And he sounds quite arrogant.
00:53:47,00:53:49,He said he was humming the melody
00:53:49,00:53:51,and then the words came to him
00:53:51,00:53:52,"and he thought to himself,"
00:53:52,00:53:55,"""Hang on, I'm a very talented songwriter,"
00:53:55,00:53:57,"""but even I'm not this talented,"
00:53:57,00:53:59,"""our higher power is writing through me."""
00:53:59,00:54:01,- That God again.
00:54:01,00:54:03,- That bloody God he gets everywhere.
00:54:03,00:54:05,And he used descriptions that he'd read
00:54:05,00:54:06,in National Geographic.
00:54:06,00:54:09,And I think he'd read a biography of Dr. Livingston
00:54:09,00:54:10,to get his Africa...
00:54:10,00:54:15,"- Okay, we'll just bang up to the minute"
00:54:15,00:54:17,for the very latest news out of the continent.
00:54:17,00:54:19,"- He'd basically been, I think we can say."
00:54:19,00:54:21,- Are there any brilliant Congress lyrics in the song?
00:54:21,00:54:22,I can't remember how it goes.
00:54:22,00:54:23,- There are a few.
00:54:23,00:54:25,"- I hear the reins down in Africa, is that it?"
00:54:25,00:54:26,- Yeah.
00:54:26,00:54:27,- The Serengeti is in the wrong place.
00:54:27,00:54:29,I can't remember what the lyric is.
00:54:29,00:54:30,"Like something rises over,"
00:54:30,00:54:31,a mountain rises over the Serengeti.
00:54:31,00:54:33,"Kill the manjaro over the Serengeti, I think."
00:54:33,00:54:34,Which isn't...
00:54:34,00:54:35,"- It's not too far away, isn't it?"
00:54:35,00:54:38,- It's not too far away.
00:54:38,00:54:39,- Close enough.
00:54:39,00:54:40,It's all Africa.
00:54:40,00:54:41,"Yeah, okay, got it."
00:54:41,00:54:44,- He didn't admit that he hadn't been.
00:54:44,00:54:46,And then he went in the late 1990s.
00:54:46,00:54:47,So he wrote it in 1982.
00:54:47,00:54:49,Then they toured in South Africa.
00:54:49,00:54:51,"And apparently he said when he was touring South Africa,"
00:54:51,00:54:54,"all the South Africans ran up to him and said,"
00:54:54,00:54:56,"""Wow, so when were you in Africa?"""
00:54:56,00:54:58,"And when he said he wasn't, they said,"
00:54:58,00:55:00,"""But you described it so perfectly."""
00:55:00,00:55:03,- The way that the pyramids reflect the beauties
00:55:03,00:55:05,"of Johannesburg, it's incredible."
00:55:05,00:55:07,- The other toto.
00:55:07,00:55:09,"Sorry, I've just got one more thing about the other toto."
00:55:09,00:55:10,- Yeah?
00:55:10,00:55:11,- The toto of the dog.
00:55:11,00:55:12,Wizard of Oz.
00:55:12,00:55:13,What's the famous song?
00:55:13,00:55:15,- We're off to see the wizard.
00:55:15,00:55:15,"- Oh, sorry."
00:55:15,00:55:17,- Somewhere over the rainbow.
00:55:17,00:55:20,"- Oh my God, the author had never seen a rainbow."
00:55:20,00:55:21,- I shouldn't have picked a film
00:55:21,00:55:24,which is banger after banger after banger.
00:55:24,00:55:26,Somewhere over the rainbow is the song I'm thinking of.
00:55:26,00:55:27,There were concerns about that song.
00:55:27,00:55:29,Can you guess why?
00:55:29,00:55:32,So it's an ecosystem based on selling sheet music.
00:55:32,00:55:35,Studio executives were very nervous about this song.
00:55:35,00:55:36,- Is it 'cause it's a set?
00:55:36,00:55:37,It's very short.
00:55:37,00:55:40,- It's because of the way the notes muck around.
00:55:40,00:55:41,There's an octave leap.
00:55:41,00:55:43,Somewhere.
00:55:43,00:55:46,"And it's really, it's hard for amateur singers"
00:55:46,00:55:47,to sing that well.
00:55:47,00:55:48,"And the studio bosses were like,"
00:55:48,00:55:50,"""No one's going to buy the sheet music."
00:55:50,00:55:52,"""This is junk, change it."""
00:55:52,00:55:54,- 'Cause you can't sing along to it easily.
00:55:54,00:55:55,"- Pretty much, yeah."
00:55:55,00:55:57,And so therefore that would damage their margins of the film.
00:55:57,00:55:59,- How interesting.
00:55:59,00:56:01,"I think I should shout out to our colleague, James Rawson,"
00:56:01,00:56:03,who I appealed to for this fact.
00:56:03,00:56:05,And he just really wants to air something
00:56:05,00:56:06,"that's annoyed him for years,"
00:56:06,00:56:10,"which is the Alicia Keys debut album Songs in A Minor,"
00:56:10,00:56:11,which was a great album.
00:56:11,00:56:13,(all laughing)
00:56:13,00:56:14,- Where's this going?
00:56:14,00:56:15,(all laughing)
00:56:15,00:56:16,- You might remember.
00:56:16,00:56:17,- I'm not songs.
00:56:17,00:56:19,"- They're all the A Minor, it's fine."
00:56:19,00:56:21,"Yeah, there's only..."
00:56:21,00:56:23,"Well, the internet says there's only one song in A Minor"
00:56:23,00:56:25,and I wasted quite a lot of time.
00:56:25,00:56:28,"I'm not very good at the piano, putting Spotify on,"
00:56:28,00:56:30,and then working out what key they're all in.
00:56:30,00:56:32,"And I think there are two songs in A Minor on it,"
00:56:32,00:56:34,but it's still not all of the songs.
00:56:34,00:56:36,It's only two out of 16.
00:56:36,00:56:37,So Alicia...
00:56:37,00:56:38,- That's great.
00:56:38,00:56:39,- Sort yourself out.
00:56:39,00:56:42,"And then I learned you had a son called Egypt,"
00:56:42,00:56:43,but he has been to Egypt.
00:56:43,00:56:44,(all laughing)
00:56:44,00:56:46,"- But in fairness, she's called Alicia Keys."
00:56:46,00:56:48,So obviously it's going to be in different keys.
00:56:48,00:56:49,- Brilliant.
00:56:49,00:56:50,- That's a good point.
00:56:50,00:56:51,She's pulled it back.
00:56:51,00:56:54,(all laughing)
00:56:54,00:56:56,- Here's an interesting thing.
00:56:56,00:56:58,The song Ain't No Sunshine by Bill Withers.
00:56:58,00:56:59,- Yep. - Oh yeah.
00:56:59,00:57:01,- Is Unfinished.
00:57:01,00:57:02,- Is it? - Yeah.
00:57:02,00:57:03,- Really?
00:57:03,00:57:04,"'Cause it just goes,"
00:57:04,00:57:06,"♪ I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know ♪"
00:57:06,00:57:08,And I've never got to the end of that bit.
00:57:08,00:57:10,- That's the bit.
00:57:10,00:57:12,He got to the recording booth with the song Unfinished
00:57:12,00:57:14,"and he just improvised,"
00:57:14,00:57:15,"♪ I know, I know, I know, I know, I know ♪"
00:57:15,00:57:18,"And he was like, ""I'll do this later."""
00:57:18,00:57:20,- It walked out the booth so it sounded like a fade.
00:57:20,00:57:21,(all laughing)
00:57:21,00:57:22,- Is that true?
00:57:22,00:57:23,- Yeah. - That's really funny.
00:57:23,00:57:25,"- Well, thinking it'll come to me in the moment,"
00:57:25,00:57:26,it's fine. - Yeah.
00:57:26,00:57:28,(all laughing)
00:57:28,00:57:28,- That's great.
00:57:28,00:57:29,"- But yeah, if you listen long enough,"
00:57:29,00:57:31,"it goes, ""No, I don't know."""
00:57:31,00:57:33,(all laughing)
00:57:33,00:57:35,(upbeat music)
00:57:35,00:57:39,"- Okay, that's it."
