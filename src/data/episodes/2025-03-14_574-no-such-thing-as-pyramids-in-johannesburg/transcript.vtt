00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:14.800
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.440
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.240
 a weekly podcast coming to you

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.680
 from the QI offices in Hoburn.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.040
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.240
 I'm sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.400
 James Harkin and Anna Tyshinski.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.720
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.720
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.360
 And in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.800
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Anna.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.640
 - My fact this week is that if an eel

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.200
 ends up in a predator's stomach,

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.960
 it can reverse out through its gills.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.160
 - That's pretty amazing.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.640
 - This is Japanese eels.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.840
 And it's recently found out that they can get swallowed

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.800
 by these sleeper fish, dark sleeper fish.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.640
 And then they go through the digestive tract,

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.360
 but then they are just able to wibble their way back,

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.640
 back out towards the gills and then slink out.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.360
 I think some slunk out through the mouth

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.760
 and then some were able to slink their way out

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.460
 actually through the slits that were the gills.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.560
 - Yeah, that's amazing.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.080
 I actually don't really have a good idea of fish anatomy.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.560
 I wouldn't have thought that the gills

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.440
 would be attached to the digestive system.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.780
 - It does sound all hollow, doesn't it?

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:21.620
 - Yeah.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:22.460
 - We say that.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.200
 - Our gills, as people.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.040
 - Our lungs.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.400
 - Yeah, are sort of connected.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.160
 - You know, there's a bit where the pipe's branch, but--

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.000
 - That's true.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.640
 It's like if you swallow a piece of apple

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.480
 the wrong way it goes down towards your lungs.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.320
 - Exactly.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.560
 I mean, kind of sort of the same way

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.400
 they're coming out of the bit.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.560
 We use the breathing.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.000
 - Yeah, you tend to take a few turns, probably.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.840
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.680
 But it is mad.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.520
 - It is insane.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.360
 - And the scientists who did it,

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.240
 I love it, it was a team at Nagasaki University.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.760
 And they filled the eels with the chemical

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.120
 that meant they could be x-ray,

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.640
 they could show up on an x-ray.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.680
 And then, it was really a bit mean,

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.280
 they just introduced the eels to the dark sleeper fish,

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.320
 which we're gonna be very hungry for them.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.360
 And one would get swallowed and then they'd just observe.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.300
 And about a third of the time, the eel escaped.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.560
 - That's interesting.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.440
 Do we think it happens in the wild, then?

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.480
 - I think it definitely does.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.880
 - Yeah, it does, I think.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.760
 And they see that some make it halfway out,

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.080
 some almost make it out,

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.080
 but they get stuck with their heads.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.640
 It's not, yeah, it's not a foolproof process.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.560
 But what a weird thing to be the sleeper fish.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.400
 You eat your lunch.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.240
 - I know.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.240
 - And then it's sitting next to you a minute later.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.640
 - It does happen a bit in nature.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:25.480
 Doesn't it?

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.440
 That things get eaten and then can escape.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.280
 - Yes.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.120
 - I reckon.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.940
 Like Jonah.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:30.780
 - Jonah?

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:31.620
 - I think is one of them.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.460
 - Is that his nature?

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.640
 - There's a snail called Tornatelides boiningi

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.040
 that's also found in Japan.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.960
 And it's swallowed by this bird.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.160
 And 5% of them are able to escape out of the bum.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.440
 - Out of the bum?

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.280
 - Out of the bum.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.120
 - Okay.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.960
 - That's all the way through.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:48.800
 That's very impressive, isn't it?

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.640
 - That's a waiting game.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.680
 - Well, on the other hand, you don't have to reverse.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.520
 You just put your head down and go for it.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.360
 - I do.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.200
 - Yeah.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.720
 - But then 5% of them can get through and survive

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.080
 for at least one week.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.760
 And actually quite often when they come out,

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.720
 if it's a female who's pregnant,

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.960
 they'll give birth straight afterwards.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:05.800
 And some people-

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.000
 - That, as in like it brings on neighbor.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.840
 - Yeah.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:08.880
 - Wow, like eating a curry or something.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:09.960
 Maybe she did it on purpose.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:10.800
 She was so sick, big time.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.320
 - I don't think it's like in the Lansdale community,

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.960
 they're like, oh, maybe if we have sex,

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.720
 then the baby will come.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.180
 And they're like, yeah, but maybe if we get eaten

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.520
 by a bird, it will come.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.120
 - That's just the inducing method.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.480
 Imagine that at hospitals,

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.240
 if you have to be swallowed by an animal at all.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.680
 Baby needs to come early.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.040
 I found this great book called Eels by James Prosek.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.880
 It's one of those classic books that we love

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.240
 where it's just the single subject,

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.120
 the whole history of the animal.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.120
 And it's pretty fascinating.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.240
 We've spoken about before about how Eels,

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.280
 they have the call,

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.440
 which kind of brings them back to the ocean.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.080
 'Cause they are born in salt water

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.520
 and they find river water in order to give birth.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.560
 And most animals do the opposite of that.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.280
 Salmon will do the opposite of that.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.360
 They're so mysterious.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.200
 And we've spoken about this.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.360
 They've never, we just never have seen

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.080
 any pregnant Eels really or how they give birth.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.360
 But what's fascinating is how strong that call is.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.000
 So this guy, James Prosek,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 he has some Eels in his house, in a tank.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.600
 And he said he woke up one morning

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.240
 and they had busted through the top,

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.520
 which was held down with rocks

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.240
 and they were wriggling on the floor,

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.440
 just trying to get out.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.520
 - You're joking.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.440
 - So then he reinforced it, he put them back in,

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.680
 put the lid on and then he came down

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.640
 and they were slamming their heads into the sea.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.440
 - They were constructing a rudimentary drill

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.920
 from the stuff in their tank.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:26.760
 That was incredible.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.720
 - So basically some of them,

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.520
 even like to the point of kill themselves,

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.760
 but they were smacking their heads

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.640
 so hard to try and get through this thing.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.240
 - Okay, I'm not going to say that that's not true,

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.480
 but that's amazing.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.320
 - It's horror film.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.600
 - It's in his book and he's like a lead illness writer.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.760
 - I was implying, there's a subtext there that I think.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.920
 There is a thing that when they first realized

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.760
 that there was a homininstinct in birds,

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.840
 one of the experiments they did was,

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.080
 they got the birds in a cage

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.720
 and put little sort of ink on their feet

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.080
 and then they would put paper on the floor of the cage

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.520
 and then they could see that the birds

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.080
 were trying to go in a certain direction.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.920
 - Right.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:59.760
 - God, it's so interesting.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.800
 - It is amazing 'cause they will often,

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.320
 if there's a bit of damp ground in a field,

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.080
 they will make their way out of their pond

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.640
 or whatever bit of fresh water they're in

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:08.640
 and they'll slither along

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.200
 and start eating some farmland stuff and come back.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.960
 But when they want to go back to the ocean,

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.280
 this is all true, James.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.520
 They can stay in wait.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.680
 They just wait and wait until the circumstances are right

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.160
 to get them back to the ocean.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.920
 And then once they need to make that trip,

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.120
 once a storm has come

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.520
 and the water levels have risen a bit

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.640
 and everything's wet,

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.160
 they perform like ninja-like abilities.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.120
 So if they get to a hill,

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.320
 they roll into a ball and roll down the hill.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.160
 - No way.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.000
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.760
 They can climb up walls by braiding themselves

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.600
 along the side of moths, walls, and it's extraordinary.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.800
 - Did you watch a cartoon?

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.440
 - This is James Prasek, Eels.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.600
 - It is incredible.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.120
 Do you know where has an eel festival, by the way?

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.960
 - Eely?

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.760
 - Because, oh, Eely, yeah, Eely.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:49.760
 - Correct.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:50.600
 - Which one?

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.440
 - Eely.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.280
 - Well, there we go.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.120
 - Not Eely, London.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.960
 - It wasn't a trick question.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.400
 It was actually just an on-the-nose.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.280
 - Because Eely is named after the eels, isn't it?

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.320
 - I believe so.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.040
 But very sadly, the last eel catcher in Eely

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.680
 retired 10 years ago.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.640
 Because they've had this terrible decline of population,

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.720
 mostly due to humans.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.280
 But you know, there used to be a staple food in Cambridgeshire.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.720
 I just find that so bizarre.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.560
 - Yeah.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.400
 - You just, like, a thousand years ago,

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.480
 you had a rock, you had an eel, effectively.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:20.840
 And the main thing to do now is removing barriers in rivers.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.160
 'Cause there are just so many

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.520
 hundreds and thousands of these things.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.040
 And most of them are out at, like, a defunct.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.960
 They're like an old water mill.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:27.800
 - Yeah.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:28.640
 - You know, build a barrier across the river

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.800
 'cause they needed to harness the power of--

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:30.640
 - And locks and stuff.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.800
 Like, we've got quite a lot of eel,

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.760
 we've got quite a lot of eel stares near us.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:34.600
 - Do you know?

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.440
 - Which would like to go over locks,

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.280
 'cause I live in the Fens,

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.120
 which is where they used to be all over the stuff.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.960
 - Yes.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:38.800
 - Like your eel country.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.620
 - Were it?

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:40.460
 Well, yeah, I'm really, yeah.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.920
 It's really hard to get an atlas of eel barriers

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.700
 because the researchers looking at it found

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.220
 there are 300 different words

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.340
 which describe obstacles and rivers.

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.260
 Which I find insane. - Really?

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.180
 - You know, a sluice, or a lock, or a weir,

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.740
 or, like, all of these things.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.260
 There are hundreds of terms, so you need to map them.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.340
 But there aren't, like, groups removing them slowly,

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:01.500
 but surely, which is very cool.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:02.700
 - I think it's a bit mysterious

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.260
 why their numbers have declined so rapidly, you know,

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.100
 by 90% in the last 50 years.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.740
 But they're so sought after now.

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:13.100
 - There are 350 million eels taken from Europe to Asia

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:13.940
 every year.

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:14.780
 - Is this legal or illegal?

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.100
 - All illegal, very illegal.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.140
 - This is smug eel, smuggling?

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.140
 - Yes, because they're very endangered now,

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:20.180
 and so they're very protected.

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.900
 You're only allowed to take certain ones and...

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:24.380
 - I'd love if they get there,

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:25.900
 and then they wake up the next morning

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.460
 after having arrived,

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:29.380
 all the eels have just migrated back.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:30.700
 (all laughing)

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.940
 - Eel shape holes in all of the buildings.

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:34.020
 (all laughing)

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.340
 - Which are just holes, aren't they?

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:37.460
 (all laughing)

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.180
 - Well, if they might go sideways through the wall.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.660
 Speaking of smuggling, or not speaking of smuggling,

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:45.180
 but you'll see where the connection is.

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:47.540
 Last year, there was doctors in Vietnam

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:51.020
 who pulled out a two-foot eel from man's intestines

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:53.420
 after he inserted it into his bottom.

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:54.860
 - Oh, dear.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.900
 - And the problem was not so much putting the eel up there,

00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:58.940
 although that was quite bad,

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:00.620
 but he'd also shoved a lemon up there

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:02.180
 so that it couldn't escape.

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:05.940
 - No, I don't believe this, James.

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.060
 - Well, it's true, it's true.

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:09.660
 - It sounds like he's trying to make a delicious meal

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.500
 inside himself, a squeeze of lemon,

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.380
 and then was it a sprinkle of salt?

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:14.740
 - The man survived,

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:16.980
 even though the eel had started biting

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:18.860
 through his abdominal cavity.

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:21.100
 - I don't think we can blame the eel a touch for that.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.260
 - No, no, I've not blamed the eel, I've not.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.620
 - I'm blaming you for raising this,

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:28.180
 and I certainly, for one, I'm not finding it funny,

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.660
 because I'm well aware that in 2013,

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:32.740
 there was a similar, very serious incident,

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:36.060
 and 33 people, staff at Auckland City Hospital,

00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:38.140
 were punished, and a few of them sacked

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.540
 for looking at an x-ray unnecessarily

00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:42.620
 of a man who had an eel stuck

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.380
 in the lowest parts of his digestive system.

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:47.580
 - Well, you can get fired for looking at an x-ray?

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:48.740
 - It was found that they did not need

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:50.940
 to be looking at the x-ray, all his notes.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:52.500
 - Oh, I can see his notes. - Oh, come on.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.500
 - Maybe if it has incriminating--

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.660
 - Down over here, speaking up for medical malpractice.

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:58.140
 (all laughing)

00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:59.500
 If as long as it's funny.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:00.980
 - You have to learn.

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:04.540
 - As a doctor, to see things you would not normally see.

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:06.580
 - Exactly, what happens if then the next day,

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:08.180
 someone else comes with an eagle up the bum,

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.140
 but you don't recognize it?

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:10.740
 - Yeah, sorry, I don't know what to do.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.060
 It was too funny, and I wasn't allowed to do it.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.300
 (all laughing)

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:19.060
 - Do you know where European and American eels come from?

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:20.020
 - European America?

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:22.700
 - No, the ocean bits, where they're born, do you know?

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:24.860
 - They haven't been said on the orders from the Sargasso Sea.

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:27.500
 - Sargasso Sea, but do you know where the Sargasso Sea is?

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.060
 - It's in the Atlantic. - Is it Bermuda?

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:31.220
 - It's Bermuda. - Oh, God.

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:33.300
 - Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:34.900
 It is within the Triangle.

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.020
 Let's head this off at the path.

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:37.180
 - Is it within the Triangle?

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:38.900
 - Well, the Triangle is an undefined border.

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:40.900
 We don't really know how far the Triangle extends.

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:41.740
 - Are we in the Triangle now?

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:42.940
 - Technically, yes.

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:46.340
 - I thought it went from Bermuda to the tip of Florida

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:48.300
 to the tip of South America.

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:49.660
 I thought it was defined, no.

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:51.420
 - I don't know, I don't really know about this stuff.

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:54.340
 (all laughing)

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:56.260
 - It might be my area of interest.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.540
 It might be a lumpy triangle.

00:09:58.540 --> 00:09:59.860
 There might be a little bit of flexibility.

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:02.780
 - I heard it on a podcast called The Crypto-Tactics.

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:05.020
 They were very clear about the definitions.

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:07.300
 - Oh, well, trust them, great show.

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.260
 - What's your theory?

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.100
 They're all getting started outside there.

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:12.620
 - Just saying the mystery of them,

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:14.220
 I can't believe that hasn't been folded in

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:15.260
 as an extraordinary creation.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:19.100
 - If they're being called to a, let's say a mothership,

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.340
 metaphorically speaking,

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:23.780
 that's they're being drawn to a mothership, aren't they?

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:24.620
 - And they talk about it.

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:26.020
 They say the mystery of them being,

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:27.700
 this calling to the Sargasso Sea.

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:31.940
 They left as glass eggs, basically, in their look.

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:34.340
 They get carried in the currents all over the world.

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:36.180
 They end up in fresh water.

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:38.220
 They live there up to a hundred years.

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:41.460
 And then they somehow find their way back to the Sargasso.

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:45.420
 - I suppose that is also true of many, many, many other species

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:48.780
 that they managed to go back to their original breeding grounds.

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:49.860
 - They are mysterious, aren't they?

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:52.100
 They are kind of, it's incredible we haven't cracked it.

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:53.900
 Even with all our knowledge.

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:56.540
 You know, you can, all your computers and all of that

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:58.900
 and all your internet and you still can't do it, can you?

00:10:58.900 --> 00:10:59.820
 - Can't crack the eels.

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.220
 - Yeah, get on to it, eel on musk.

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:03.300
 - Oh God.

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:04.540
 - Well done, well done.

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:05.700
 Let's distract them with that.

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.740
 We've mostly been talking about,

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:12.300
 yeah, European and European eels.

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:15.820
 But conger eels, we have, and they're massive.

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:18.060
 And they all hold on to each other.

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:20.900
 - They all go back to the Sargasso Sea in one big line.

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:24.580
 Apart from when one line of congery

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:27.220
 is accidentally breaks off and goes to the wrong place.

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:30.140
 - That's the European eel, the American eel.

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:32.820
 - No, the conger eels, different spelling,

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:35.940
 are, well, hunted all over British Isles,

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:37.540
 particularly in Cornwall and the Isles of Silly.

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:40.260
 And I just read in an old book,

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:41.420
 and I can't find it anywhere else,

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:42.820
 but the way to catch conger eels,

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:45.460
 you know, sometimes you'll put a stick into a river

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:47.900
 and the eels would wind around it and then you'd pull it up.

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:48.740
 - Didn't know that, okay.

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:49.820
 - I think that's what people did.

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:52.020
 Well, apparently the traditional way to catch them

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:55.580
 in the Isles of Silly is you suspend a small boy

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:58.660
 upside down in front of the hole in which they live,

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:01.020
 wait for the eel to wrap itself around him.

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:03.500
 And these things can be up to three meters long.

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.820
 And then you pull the boy up.

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:07.740
 - Why does he need to be upside down?

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:10.020
 - I think maybe he wants me to grab them.

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.860
 - He would get ahead of it before too long, this boy.

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:13.900
 - I think they come pretty fast.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.340
 - We don't seem to be concerned about his welfare,

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:16.660
 so it's fine, but.

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:18.060
 - He's happy to oblige.

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:19.540
 He gets some of the jelly deal.

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.900
 - Do you guys remember, I'm sure I pitched an eel fact

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:23.820
 about six months ago and it didn't get any traction

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:25.160
 with you guys.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:26.000
 - Oh, there we go.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.700
 - It was because in my local news agent,

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.620
 they had a fisherman monthly magazine.

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:32.140
 And it had a picture on the front of a guy

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:33.780
 with the largest eel you've ever seen.

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:34.620
 It was incredible.

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:35.540
 - Yeah, but that's not a fact.

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:36.380
 That's the thing.

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:37.740
 You can't just say my fact this week

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:39.420
 is you get really big eels.

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:41.740
 - He'd broken the record for biggest eel caught in Britain.

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:42.620
 I can't remember his name now.

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:44.780
 I wrote it down at the time, but I've forgotten it.

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:45.780
 - And what was the fact?

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:48.020
 - It's just like the record for the largest eel

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:50.300
 fished in Britain have been smashed by this guy.

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:53.100
 But guys, honestly, it was like an elephant's trunk.

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:53.940
 It was incredible.

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:54.780
 - Yeah.

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:55.740
 - It was a few feet long.

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:57.940
 - I think this is maybe because this was this period

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:00.980
 where all your facts were the most massive kettle

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:04.420
 in just everything was an undefinable size.

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:06.780
 You refused to tell us the measurements of.

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:07.820
 - It was a trolley big eel.

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:09.540
 Anyway, I bought that magazine and I think I'm sure

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:11.060
 there's a fisherman near where I live

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:12.540
 who's gone absolutely devastated

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:14.180
 'cause he trots along to his news agent

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.780
 for the one copy they stocked with this magazine.

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:18.460
 It's not a big rack of them.

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:22.340
 - Oh, he's missed the biggest eel news in the century.

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:24.620
 - He's still living in a full paradise.

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:25.980
 - He's done the time, Andy.

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:27.260
 He owned that edition.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.340
 I feel like there's an elephant in the room

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:31.980
 given that we're doing a fact about things

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:33.380
 surviving being eaten.

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:35.540
 In years to come, people will have forgotten this news story

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:37.340
 that has been quite big this month

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:39.780
 of the person who's been eaten by a whale.

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:42.540
 - He was a kayaker, wasn't he, a Venezuelan guy?

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:43.380
 - Did that happen?

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:45.860
 'Cause I saw the headline, didn't read the article

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:48.300
 and then saw a debunk and didn't read the article either.

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:49.140
 - It did happen.

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:52.460
 - The video is quite good.

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:53.300
 - The video is amazing.

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:54.820
 - How enticing does something have to be there

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:57.060
 before you all click on it?

00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:00.540
 - I go through a lot of web pages every single day.

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:01.860
 - I'm like, yeah, yeah, whatever.

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:02.940
 - He got into the world's mouth

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:03.780
 and then the world's matter of mouth.

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:05.580
 - So he did go through into this.

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:06.420
 - No, no, no.

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:08.260
 There was no happening. - It was a few seconds later.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.420
 I actually, I heard about this story on a recent episode

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:11.380
 of what was the show you were talking about?

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:12.220
 Cryptid fact.

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:15.940
 - They did a really good breakdown of that whole story.

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:17.900
 - Did you go through that bit by bit?

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:18.740
 - They did, yeah.

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:19.580
 - Actually, that was the thing

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:21.580
 where I saw the headline that just scrolled past it.

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:23.460
 (all laughing)

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:24.700
 - Very sensible.

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:26.620
 - I saw the weird thing about it.

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:28.180
 Well, there were two, there were two quite sweet things.

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:29.980
 So they were going on a kayaking trip

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:32.300
 for this guy's dad's birthday.

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:33.580
 Initially, the headlines were like,

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:35.140
 caught on camera by his dad.

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:37.900
 And I thought, oh my God, this insensitive father's

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:39.340
 filming the whole bloody thing.

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:41.540
 But he did have a kayak mounted camera.

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:42.980
 If that's what anyone else is worried about,

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:45.940
 he wasn't holding the camera rather than saving his boy.

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:47.700
 - Yeah, oh yeah, did you take the picture

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:49.420
 of the insensitive dad on your show?

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:52.660
 - I defended him because I think that if you know

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:54.260
 the eating habits, you'd probably go,

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:55.380
 he's not going to swallow him.

00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:56.660
 He'll be back in a second.

00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:57.620
 - That's about defense.

00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:59.220
 - And also, he was a distance away.

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:00.060
 - Yeah.

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:00.900
 - What are you going to do?

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.220
 Swim over and have a word?

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:03.580
 You just keep filming at that point.

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:04.980
 - You're both fathers.

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:07.180
 - Also, you'll need a crime reference number

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:08.980
 from the police, so they need evidence.

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:09.980
 Take it from me.

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:12.580
 - I mean, I'm not normally on the side of this kind of thing,

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:14.380
 but I've just been skiing with my three-year-old

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:16.620
 for the number of times I've filmed her falling over

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:18.100
 as opposed to going and helping her.

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:18.940
 - Yeah.

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:21.300
 - Right, you guys, social services are coming for everyone.

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:22.660
 Imagine, this is all right.

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.900
 I'm sure he'll come out with a mouth any time now.

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:26.220
 So it was mounted on his kayak,

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.580
 so the dad was not just holding a camera filming him,

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:29.700
 but I thought the quite interesting thing

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:32.500
 about human reactions is the dad didn't make a sound

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.580
 when it happened, so he's seen what happens,

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:35.580
 but he's so shocked.

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:37.420
 And when the guy was then spat out of the whale's mouth,

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:39.140
 the dad was like, mate, you're okay.

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:40.540
 Shit, don't panic.

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:41.460
 It's still there.

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:42.620
 Get back in your kayak.

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:43.580
 - But it's silent.

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:45.540
 I see, what does his son get followed by a whale?

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:46.700
 - Well, men don't like talking to each other.

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:47.540
 What do you want?

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:48.940
 (all laughing)

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:50.460
 Unless it's in a podcast format.

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:52.060
 - Even then, the only question is,

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:54.020
 is that the new kayak that's just been...

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:56.060
 (all laughing)

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:57.540
 - I think we want to normalize this,

00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:59.900
 and we want to say to guys, if you're listening to this,

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:01.820
 if your son has ever eaten by a whale,

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:03.420
 then do try and talk about it.

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:04.580
 - Yeah.

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:05.420
 - Yeah, make yourself.

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:06.260
 - Be a legend.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:07.420
 Have a chat.

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:10.000
 (upbeat music)

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.080
 (upbeat music)

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.240
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two,

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:16.440
 and that is James.

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:17.860
 - Okay, my fact this week is that

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:19.760
 Sweden's Minister for Equality

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:23.360
 has a pathological fear of bananas.

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.920
 - But all bananas equally.

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:26.160
 (all laughing)

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:27.760
 - Very nice.

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:28.600
 - Yeah.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:29.480
 - This is incredible.

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.720
 I mean, it really is a fear, isn't it?

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.680
 - It's, well, yes, it is a fear.

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:37.380
 It was in the newspapers quite recently,

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:40.980
 especially in Sweden, unsurprisingly.

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:42.320
 - That's where it started, didn't it?

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:44.440
 - Yeah, "Sweet Afraid of Bananas."

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:45.280
 - Oh, yeah.

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:46.280
 - She herself is a vegetable, yes?

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:47.480
 - Oh, yeah.

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:48.320
 - I suppose so.

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:49.300
 - Sweet, sweet.

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.780
 - She, there was some leaked emails

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:55.220
 to a tabloid newspaper called Expressen,

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:56.980
 and they said that this lady,

00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:59.140
 who's called Paulina Brandberg,

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:01.280
 has a strong allergy to bananas,

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.660
 so we would appreciate it if there were no bananas

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:06.140
 in the room where she'll be staying.

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:07.820
 And the big scandal really is

00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:09.460
 that she isn't allergic to bananas.

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:10.700
 She's just scared of them.

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:11.540
 - Yes.

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:13.500
 - And she said, like, they asked her,

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.220
 they were like, "Are you really allergic to bananas?"

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:19.200
 And she's like, "Well, it's sort of analogy, you could say.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.780
 It's something that I got professional help for."

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:23.260
 And then eventually it came out

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:24.620
 that she was just really hated them.

00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:27.700
 But, I mean, in fairness, you know, it's equally bad.

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:28.980
 Is it equally bad?

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:30.700
 Well, it depends how bad your allergy is.

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:32.860
 - Yeah, I don't think it's, this is a big,

00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:34.660
 I don't think this is a big scandal.

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:37.100
 There have been bigger in the world of politics.

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:40.580
 - I know Sweden's politics are, you know, changing,

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:41.820
 but it's still, guys,

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:42.980
 if this is still what you're concerned with.

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:43.820
 - And you know what?

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:45.260
 Like, the opposition party,

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:46.900
 they could have taken advantage of this

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:49.420
 and maybe brought down the Swedish government.

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:53.180
 But one of the opposition social democrats,

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:57.500
 Teresa Carvalho said that she also has fear of bananas.

00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:58.340
 - I love that.

00:17:58.340 --> 00:17:59.740
 - And on this issue, we stand united

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:01.100
 against a common enemy.

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:01.940
 - Yeah.

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:03.100
 - That's not plausible.

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:04.940
 So I'll try to jump on the bandwagon.

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:06.500
 - There can't be two, you're right.

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:08.420
 - It's quite a rare phobia.

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:09.260
 - Well, I think it's lovely.

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:12.460
 And she, you know, she can't just spot a banana

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:13.500
 and be alarmed by it.

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:15.140
 She can smell bananas

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:18.100
 or if someone has recently eaten a banana in the room,

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:19.340
 she can truffle that out.

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:20.860
 - You know why, speaking of truffles,

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:24.260
 it's a bit like my severe hatred of mushrooms.

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:25.100
 - Yeah.

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:25.940
 - Isn't it?

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:26.780
 Like, I can tell if there's a mushroom

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:29.100
 in someone's eater mushrooms recently and stuff.

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:30.340
 - You don't have a phobia of mushrooms.

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:32.260
 - I think I do really, actually, yeah.

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:34.140
 - I find them really disgusting,

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:36.100
 but also if there's one growing in the corner,

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:37.940
 I'll try not walk near it kind of thing.

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:39.620
 - It's a stronger version to something

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:41.980
 which actually is not gonna harm you.

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:43.620
 - The Prime Minister backed her as well.

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:44.780
 He sort of said, yeah.

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:46.180
 So like, when he found out it was a phobia.

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:47.700
 - What was the alternative to sack her, basically?

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:50.260
 - I think she was getting mocked

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.260
 and he said we shouldn't be mocking people

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:54.620
 for their various little known phobias.

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:55.460
 - Well, it's hard, isn't it?

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:56.580
 'Cause loads of people have phobias

00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:58.420
 of things that are quite mainstream.

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:01.340
 I mean, like, height, is that a phobia?

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:02.460
 - It's a bit dangerous.

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:05.220
 Spiders, some spiders are dangerous, you know.

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:06.700
 - I would say these are phobias.

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:08.900
 'Cause these are like, they're phobias of things

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:10.380
 that aren't going to harm you.

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:14.300
 A phobia of spiders in this country is totally rational.

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:16.580
 - There is a theory that there's some kind of spider called,

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:18.860
 I think it's called the six-eyed,

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:20.180
 I can't remember, is it? - More spider.

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:21.540
 - It's a bad one.

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:24.700
 And it can be lethal if it bites a human.

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:26.300
 And that lives in the plains of Africa,

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:27.820
 which are the cradle of humanity.

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:29.820
 So maybe there's something genetic going on there.

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:31.500
 So that might be where spider fear comes from.

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:33.500
 - Yeah, six-eyed, sound spider.

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:34.340
 - And spider, there you go.

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:35.780
 - And I think the problem, like,

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:37.780
 the reason that the Prime Minister of Sweden

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:40.340
 and the opposition sort of backed her on this

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:42.340
 is, one, because it's ridiculous

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:44.140
 that anyone should care about it.

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:45.740
 But two, because it was kind of distracting

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:47.460
 from the good work that this woman's doing

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:49.420
 in her equality. - The famously unequal

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:51.620
 country of Sweden. (laughing)

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:52.660
 - It's not as obscure as you think.

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:54.220
 It was an issue that was brought up on Loose Women

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:56.500
 because one of the stars, Charlene White,

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:58.020
 has a phobia of bananas as well.

00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:58.860
 - I don't know. - Yeah.

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:01.260
 - It's common, all these people suddenly claiming.

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:03.620
 - There is one person with a banana phobia

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:07.020
 who is the most ironic person given the name.

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:08.860
 - Oh. - Can you guess who it is?

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:10.260
 - The guy who voiced Banana Man.

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:11.140
 - No. - No.

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:13.580
 - Banana Rama, the band? - Oh, the band.

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:15.860
 I actually checked to see if they were allergic.

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:18.300
 - The founder of the Big Yellow Storage Company.

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:19.620
 - Oh, very good, but no.

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:24.220
 So this person's surname is very related to bananas.

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:25.340
 - John Peele.

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:26.660
 - Very good, but no.

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:28.140
 - Okay. - Oh.

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:31.140
 - Monkey, something. - Famous types of banana.

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:34.220
 - Oh, Cavendish, the Duke of Cavendish.

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:36.020
 - Cyclist Mark Cavendish.

00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:37.620
 - Yes, sorry. - All right.

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:40.660
 - We both know that it's the first Cavendish you think of.

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:42.660
 - The first Cavendish that all of our listeners

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:45.020
 will be thinking of when they hear that name,

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:47.060
 the Duke of Cavendish.

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:49.540
 No, Mark Cavendish, the cyclist,

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:52.060
 he says even seeing someone eating a banana

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:54.620
 gives him goosebumps and even thinking about it

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:55.860
 makes him gag.

00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:57.060
 - That's incredible. - Wow.

00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:59.620
 - And he said it's the stringy bits on a banana

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:00.900
 that he really hates.

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:03.340
 - They're not the best bits, for sure.

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:05.860
 - They're not the sweetest part.

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:09.380
 - Well, he once won a bike race in Elania in Turkey

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:11.860
 and he was given the world's biggest bunch of bananas

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:12.700
 at price.

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:16.180
 - Oh, God, that's terrible. - That's the scar of your fears.

00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:18.340
 And that's why it's bad having one of these niche phobias

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:19.780
 because it's very hard to, like,

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:22.860
 no one presents you with it like a bouquet of pigeons

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:24.860
 at the end of it.

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:26.780
 - Another person who has a fear of bananas,

00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:28.660
 Harriet Kemsley, the comedian.

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:29.500
 - The comedian.

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:32.500
 - Yeah, on another podcast called Off Menu,

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:33.340
 which I've never heard of.

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:34.660
 Have you guys heard of that?

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:36.700
 - No, I think it's the cryptid factor,

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:37.900
 I think the fans of it.

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:41.140
 - Yeah, well, she was on that and she said,

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:44.940
 she hates it when you throw a banana peel into a bin

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:46.780
 and it doesn't go all the way in

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:48.300
 so it looks like it's crawling out.

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:49.700
 - Yeah, I can see that. - And I think I can see that,

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:51.460
 actually. - Oh, gosh.

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:53.740
 People have a lot of time to think, don't they?

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:54.580
 (all laugh)

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:56.580
 - Sorry, but just...

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:57.420
 - I think it's instinct.

00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:59.060
 - I mean, really, non-intended, yeah.

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:00.620
 Did we say that the Cavendish is named after,

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:02.540
 the Cavendish banana is named after the Duke of Cavendish?

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:03.580
 We'll just get emails otherwise.

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:05.100
 - I think we have meant, I think, yeah.

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:07.220
 - I think all of our listeners are very familiar

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:09.660
 with the Duke of Cavendish, aren't they?

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:13.460
 - Fears of bananas, the Guardian did a bit of digging

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:16.220
 into this, I think, off the back of the Swedish politician.

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:19.140
 They found a woman with a banana phobia who had it

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:21.460
 pretty strongly, like, again, breaks out in a sweat,

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:22.420
 can't bear being around them,

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:24.260
 avoids them in the supermarket, that kind of thing.

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:27.100
 She once was on a flight, quite a long-haul flight.

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:29.660
 She woke up in the morning after everyone on the flight

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:30.940
 had been asleep, and everyone around her

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:34.300
 had been given their mid-morning snack, a banana.

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:37.060
 I mean, just absolute nightmare territory.

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:38.620
 - Imagine, you're in a plane.

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:39.580
 - Banana's on a plane.

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:40.420
 - It's basically...

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:41.740
 - Yeah, motherfucking!

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:43.580
 (all laugh)

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:47.500
 - I was looking at kind of more common, uncommon phobias,

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:49.540
 and bananas was a surprising one.

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:50.980
 I didn't know that it was quite common

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:52.020
 among the uncommon phobias,

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:53.740
 but it does seem to be bananas,

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:58.100
 Psydonglobophobia, which is an intense fear of cotton balls,

00:22:58.100 --> 00:22:59.460
 seems to be another one.

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:01.580
 - Psydonglobophobia.

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:03.660
 - That's surely more niche these days.

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:04.700
 - Cotton balls?

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:06.740
 - Are cotton balls still a big part of...

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:08.140
 - I use them every day.

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:09.620
 (all laugh)

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:10.620
 - Okay, grandma.

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:12.180
 (all laugh)

00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:15.460
 - Actually, you know, Anna has an extremely common accent,

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:18.460
 but she puts them in her cheeks and it makes her speak this way.

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:19.940
 - Exactly.

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:22.660
 - I've got a lovely glass antique container next to the bath

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:23.500
 full of cotton balls.

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.140
 - It doesn't surprise me as a leaf.

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:25.980
 It doesn't surprise me.

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:27.540
 Are they useful for washing things?

00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:29.820
 - Yeah, I actually do it to...

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:31.140
 - Makeup removal.

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:34.420
 - For women will be more I favor with cotton balls than men.

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:36.380
 - I mean, I have more makeup in the time that you've known me.

00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:37.220
 - Okay.

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:38.060
 (all laugh)

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:40.540
 - It's washing food off a child's mouth.

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:41.380
 - Yeah.

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:42.220
 - Right, okay.

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:43.940
 - Cleaning very, very young babies' bums,

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:45.020
 you would use cotton balls.

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:45.860
 - Yes.

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:47.180
 - That's right.

00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:48.620
 - Whenever you wear makeup,

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:50.660
 you basically continue to wear makeup

00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:52.860
 for the next two weeks until it goes off.

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:55.260
 - Whenever we do a photo shoot every couple of years,

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:57.700
 I look more and more like I've got black eyes.

00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:59.140
 (all laugh)

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:00.420
 But another one is balloons.

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:01.780
 I need some with a phobia of balloons.

00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:02.620
 - Oh yeah.

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:03.460
 - And...

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:04.300
 - Oprah Winfrey.

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:05.140
 - Really?

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:06.340
 - Yeah, she's got a fear of balloons.

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:09.060
 The popping sound reminds her of a gunshot.

00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:11.700
 So apparently balloons are not allowed near Oprah,

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:15.100
 in the same way bananas are not allowed near this Swedish...

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:17.060
 - Well, there was one guy who has a phobia of balloons

00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:18.900
 who had to miss his brother's wedding

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:21.300
 'cause his brother had balloons at the wedding.

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:23.860
 And I just thought, as his brother,

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:26.180
 are you gonna insist on balloons at your wedding

00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:27.420
 or let your brother come to your wedding?

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:28.380
 - Good point.

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:29.860
 I mean, balloons are not a big feature of a wedding

00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:31.980
 unless both parties are nine years old

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:34.780
 and it's one of those European royal weddings.

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:36.900
 - They always get balloons at weddings.

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:38.300
 Every wedding that I've been to, I reckon.

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:39.540
 - Excuse me, James, you're at my wedding.

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:42.060
 I challenge you to spot a single balloon in there.

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:43.020
 (all laugh)

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:45.060
 - James brought me this over.

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:47.300
 - I floated in on a wicker chair.

00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:49.900
 - Stop the wedding!

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:50.820
 (all laugh)

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:52.140
 It should have been me!

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:54.940
 - But would you, if the groom had said,

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:56.980
 "Listen, my brother has an extreme phobia of balloons

00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:59.220
 "and can't come if you have the balloons,"

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:00.540
 would you have gone to the trouble

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:01.380
 of taking the balloons away?

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:02.460
 - That's such a good point.

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:04.620
 Dodgy phobias, I just love this,

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:06.700
 in 2014, a French government minister,

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:10.820
 he had failed to pay his income tax for three years

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:13.820
 and explained it was due to administrative phobia.

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:15.220
 (James laughs)

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:16.740
 - Which also meant he hadn't paid rent

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:18.980
 on his flat in Paris for three years

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:20.820
 and he also hadn't declared a company he owned.

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:21.660
 - You know what?

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:22.820
 I didn't read about that,

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:25.740
 but I did read about a man in Sweden

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:28.780
 who got a load of letters saying that he'd been speeding

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:31.580
 but had a phobia of brown envelopes.

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:33.740
 And he got off.

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:35.900
 He said, "I thought I hadn't got any warnings

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:37.660
 "because I hadn't read any of my things."

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:38.940
 - No, come on.

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:41.700
 - Well, and then I went onto the Oxford Dictionary

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:42.700
 of National Biography

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:44.700
 and looked if there was any weird phobias on there.

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:46.820
 And I found someone called Gina Fratini,

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:51.060
 who was a British fashion designer in the '70s.

00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:53.020
 And she also had a brown envelope phobia,

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:54.060
 according to the ODMB.

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:54.900
 - Really?

00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:56.660
 - So I think it is like this thing of,

00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:58.660
 you know, you think it's gonna be bad news all the time.

00:25:58.660 --> 00:25:59.500
 - Well, it is bad news.

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:00.340
 (both laugh)

00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:01.180
 - It's the tax of writing.

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:02.020
 - You're so scared of it

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:04.380
 that you just won't open any of the envelopes.

00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:05.220
 - Yeah.

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:07.500
 - I can kind of see what it comes from.

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:09.260
 - You knew they'd arrived, hadn't you?

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:11.020
 So you've seen that.

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:13.980
 What did you think was in the brown envelope?

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:16.740
 - Couple of other famous names who have phobias.

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:19.460
 Macaulay Culkin, after making "Home Alone",

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:21.660
 developed a phobia of leaving the house.

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:22.500
 - Really?

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:24.140
 - Yeah, he had agrophobia, and that was because

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:27.020
 his life absolutely changed the paparazzi

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:28.460
 everywhere, leaping out of bushes,

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:29.660
 sort of following him in cars.

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:32.100
 He got petrified, so he needed to stay at home.

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:33.740
 He needed to be away from everyone.

00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:34.580
 - Pretty reasonable.

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:37.100
 - Nile Horan from One Direction, the band,

00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:39.940
 petrified phobia of pigeons.

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:41.220
 And when they're on tour,

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:44.020
 they have people sweep the area for pigeons

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:45.900
 if he's going to a venue.

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:47.060
 - You would think he would just carry

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:49.540
 like a sparrow hawk with him wherever he went.

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:50.380
 - Or a duckstead.

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:51.540
 - A sparrow hawk's better.

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:53.020
 Sorry, that's more rock and roll.

00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:54.620
 Much more rock and roll.

00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:56.220
 I wasn't thinking about the optics.

00:26:56.220 --> 00:27:01.420
 - On agrophobia, as you mentioned,

00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:04.220
 I think that was the first ever modern recorded phobia,

00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:07.780
 really, when psychologists started talking about phobias.

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:10.300
 And it was a guy called Westphal,

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:11.980
 who was a psychologist in the 1870s.

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:13.780
 But people were quite obsessed with it

00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:14.980
 in the late 19th century.

00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:17.820
 And Westphal described a patient who,

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:19.100
 it basically was a fear of anything

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:20.540
 that doesn't remind them of home.

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:22.940
 So he'd be out in a big square

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:24.380
 and he'd have to cling to the buildings

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:25.660
 on the way around 'cause that reminds you

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:28.100
 of being like surrounded by your awful walls.

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:29.980
 And then he said, to get home,

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:32.420
 if he has to get home and can't cling to the buildings,

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:35.140
 then he'll either follow someone very, very closely.

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:36.900
 So he's like, there's another human.

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:39.740
 Or he'll acquaint himself with a lady of the night

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:42.380
 and begin to talk to her until she realizes

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:44.500
 that he's not trying to get any custom.

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:46.260
 - Officer. (laughing)

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:51.260
 Let me assure you, this is all a simple misunderstanding.

00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:53.780
 - Read Freud and he'll understand.

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:55.300
 - Would he go to walk him home?

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:57.700
 - He'd get a number of ladies of the night to walk him home.

00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:59.980
 So he'd go with a chain of things.

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:01.980
 - Officer, officer.

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:02.980
 - Me again.

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:05.220
 - It's not an erotic conga, it's...

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:07.460
 (laughing)

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:15.180
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:16.460
 and that is Andy.

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:18.260
 My fact is that after Chernobyl,

00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:21.380
 nearby children were treated for potential radiation sickness

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:24.260
 with compulsory hourly drinks of red wine.

00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:26.860
 So, yeah. - Very nice, yeah.

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:29.540
 - This, I think, was sent in originally by Billy Vishen.

00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:31.300
 So thank you, Billy.

00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:33.620
 Chernobyl was in Soviet Union, now in Ukraine.

00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:36.220
 It was a nuclear reactor, it fell over in 1986,

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:37.060
 had a big-- - Fell over.

00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:38.340
 - Well, it didn't, you know what I mean.

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:40.700
 - It fell over. - It went badly wrong.

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:41.780
 - It went bang.

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:43.420
 - It went bang, it was a huge explosion,

00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:45.700
 and in the wake of it, obviously, lots of radiation,

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:48.820
 which spread all the way across a big chunk of Europe.

00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:49.980
 - Including the UK.

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:51.580
 - Including the UK.

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:55.700
 And in the local area, there was a belief

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:58.500
 that red wine was good for radiation sickness,

00:28:58.500 --> 00:28:59.940
 and doctors recommended it.

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:01.660
 And there were numerous cases of children

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:03.420
 who were hospitalized, not because of radiation sickness,

00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:05.660
 but because their parents have been giving them red wine

00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:07.500
 on the hour every day.

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:08.740
 - It wasn't just around the areas

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:10.300
 in the whole of the Soviet Union.

00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:11.140
 - Really, okay.

00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:13.860
 - So I spoke to my in-laws who were there at the time.

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:15.260
 Apparently, it was common opinion

00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:18.540
 that alcohol helped radiation poisoning.

00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:20.060
 And they said that actually most people,

00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:21.100
 as opposed to red wine,

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:23.260
 they would drink something called rectified spirit,

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:26.140
 which is 97.2% alcohol.

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:26.980
 - Oof, yeah.

00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:29.580
 - You can't actually kind of get by getting normal vodka,

00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:30.940
 and then distilling it, and distilling it,

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:33.020
 and distilling it until it's really, really strong.

00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:33.940
 - Wow.

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:36.140
 - Well, the red wine connection was,

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:38.420
 there was a talk that went around at the time

00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:42.020
 that Soviet submarine sailors would have wine

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:44.580
 with all of their dinner meals while they were down there,

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:47.020
 and the idea was to clean the system of radiation

00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:48.380
 in the submarines.

00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:49.740
 - Wait, so were they actually doing that?

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:51.060
 Oh, that was a rumor that they did that.

00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:52.300
 - They were definitely, I saw a menu

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:54.180
 from a submarine, a Soviet submarine.

00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:55.020
 - I'm sorry.

00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:55.860
 - Incredible menu.

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:56.700
 - Really?

00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:59.660
 - Yeah, I wasn't aware there were menus.

00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:00.500
 - Yeah.

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:01.860
 - Okay, you're in it.

00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:02.700
 - As you sit down.

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:03.980
 - Do you have anything a bit further away

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:05.140
 from the reactor, please?

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:06.900
 (all laughing)

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:08.740
 - I ought to be ill, but it escaped.

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:11.540
 (all laughing)

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:12.380
 - Wow.

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:14.260
 - Yeah, and you would have a ration of red wine

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:16.420
 for most dinner meals of most of the week.

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:17.860
 So, yeah, so rumor went around that.

00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:19.980
 - And was that because of radiation?

00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:21.980
 - Who knows, but that was what, yeah,

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:24.100
 according to people who lived in Chernobyl at the time,

00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:24.940
 who recounted stories.

00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:27.140
 - And of course, we now know that actually it does help.

00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:30.540
 - Yes, bizarrely, it seems to have been a study,

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:32.260
 hasn't there, that sort of proved it.

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:33.100
 - Yeah, a bit.

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:34.700
 - A study from the University of Pittsburgh

00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:38.220
 School of Medicine in 2008 found that something called

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:42.140
 resveratol, which is an antioxidant found in red wine,

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:44.580
 may offer protection against radiation.

00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:48.500
 It helps cells, you got some cells in a Petri dish,

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:50.540
 then it helps them against radiation,

00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:53.860
 but it didn't help mice when they tried it on mice.

00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:55.620
 - Oh, I thought we did help some of the mice.

00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:59.420
 - No, there was something called acetyl resveratol,

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:02.340
 which is like the previous thing that I tried to pronounce,

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:04.100
 but has got acetyl at the start of it,

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:05.140
 and that does help mice.

00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:05.980
 - Right, okay.

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:07.860
 - But the thing that you get in red wine on its own,

00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:08.700
 doesn't.

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:11.380
 - And also, as they said, it was a really funny thing

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:14.380
 to report because journalism is mad.

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:17.780
 Every headline, red wine can be,

00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:19.940
 like the telegraph headline literally was,

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:22.460
 red wine can protect against radiation.

00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:24.860
 Scientists may soon recommend that it is best you start

00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:26.420
 drinking heavily if exposed.

00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:28.140
 All of them saying it will protect you.

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:30.620
 - The scientist who did the study was very clear.

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:33.220
 He said that the dosage you would need to get enough

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:35.020
 to help you with any kind of radiation sickness

00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:37.300
 would be 720 bottles of wine.

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:38.660
 - Yeah, right.

00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:40.220
 - It's pretty amazing, all the stuff that happened

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:43.220
 just after Chernobyl had the moment

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:47.020
 where everyone in the government was trying to downplay it

00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:48.220
 within the Soviet Union, trying to say,

00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:50.540
 "Oh, it's not as bad as it seems."

00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:51.780
 So I've read this amazing article

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:54.740
 by a lady called Natalia Charakova,

00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:56.860
 who spoke about being there and what it was like

00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:58.780
 and all the things that were being done.

00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:01.340
 She was saying that experts were going up onto TV

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:03.020
 just saying, "You know what, actually,

00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:05.060
 "small doses of radiation are really beneficial

00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:06.260
 "we found in rat health."

00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:07.740
 And so actually, this is--

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:10.740
 - God, it's like the study for a white, wow.

00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:12.260
 - So it's not actually gonna be too bad for you.

00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:14.100
 - Like that happened in the US as well

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:17.820
 after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:21.500
 There were 132 news items in the New York Times

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:23.460
 about the bombings and not a single one

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:25.540
 mentioned anything about the radiation.

00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:28.940
 And there were 15 articles in the 10 months

00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:31.380
 after the blast that mentioned radiation at all,

00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:33.700
 and they all said there are some medical

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:36.260
 and biological benefits to be gained from radiation.

00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:37.980
 And the other thing is Oppenheimer said,

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:39.180
 "There is every reason to believe

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:41.420
 "that there was no appreciable radio activity

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:43.380
 "on the ground in Hiroshima."

00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:45.180
 So he was just like, "Oh, no, it's all fine."

00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:46.460
 "Yeah, no, we just blew them up."

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:49.620
 - Gosh, at Chernobyl when it happened,

00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:51.660
 they flew over in helicopters,

00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:54.660
 they dropped 5,000 tons of sand and lead and clay

00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:57.180
 on top of the fire to snuff it out, basically,

00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:59.100
 to stop the rest of it.

00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:00.860
 'Cause only a small amount of the radioactive material

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:03.820
 in Chernobyl actually was in this explosion.

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:06.180
 And so the impetus was to put out that fire,

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:07.740
 which they managed to do.

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:09.300
 'Cause if the rest of it had gone up,

00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:11.420
 Europe might've become uninhabitable, basically.

00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:12.340
 - Yeah, wow.

00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:13.180
 - Yeah, and it worked.

00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:14.700
 I mean, what they, you know.

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:16.540
 - It worked eventually, although I didn't realize

00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:19.020
 that the sound, the dumping in the first three days

00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:22.500
 was almost completely ineffectual, the sound and boron.

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:25.460
 So they dumped lots of sand to try and put out the fires

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:28.780
 and the boron was to counteract the radioactivity.

00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:30.860
 But I read the opening in the roof

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:33.020
 where they were trying to get it was really small

00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:35.220
 and basically all the sand missed it at first.

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:36.300
 And also when you dump sand,

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:37.940
 you picture it going down in a big lump.

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:39.380
 I hadn't thought about it, but when you dump sand,

00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:41.340
 it all like scatters out in the air

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:42.700
 and sort of ends up floating down.

00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:44.020
 - They should've put more water in it.

00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:46.180
 - Should've made wet sand, didn't they?

00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:47.820
 - Oh, big hourglass.

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:50.420
 I'm sorry to have some creative thinking here,

00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:52.340
 but you know, that funnels it, doesn't it?

00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:53.180
 - Yeah.

00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:54.420
 - Oh, you mean the top half of an hourglass?

00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:56.020
 - Yeah, I wouldn't have the whole hourglass.

00:33:56.020 --> 00:33:57.980
 - Yeah, it just goes up and down.

00:33:57.980 --> 00:33:59.980
 - Or gigantic sandcastle bucket

00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:01.860
 where you just lower the sand on top

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:03.620
 and just build a lot of good solutions.

00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:06.340
 - The interesting thing about the hourglass

00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:08.900
 is you can have as big an hourglass as you want,

00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:11.100
 but the little funnel bit has to be the same size

00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:13.820
 'cause it has to be the size of a grain of sand.

00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:17.700
 So actually you're only gonna get a tiny trickle of sand.

00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:20.180
 - That's a good point, it will take a while.

00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:22.460
 - We're sitting in that helicopter day nine.

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:23.660
 (both laughing)

00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:25.180
 Andy, are we sure about this?

00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:28.780
 - So then obviously you've got to cover this thing over.

00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:30.540
 So they built what they called a sarcophagus,

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:32.340
 like this massive steel and concrete structure

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:35.380
 to cover the reactor, what's left of the reactor.

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:36.540
 And I find this amazing.

00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:39.740
 The crane operators who put that sarcophagus in place

00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:42.540
 did so without ever seeing what they were doing.

00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:43.380
 - What do you mean?

00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:44.220
 - Riddle me that.

00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:45.540
 - Okay.

00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:47.700
 - Okay, so they're in a crane

00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:49.260
 next to this thing that's happening.

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:50.100
 - Yep.

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:52.140
 - They would give them blindfolds

00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:54.820
 because they weren't allowed to know where it was

00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:56.260
 and they got led away.

00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:57.260
 - Any advance on that?

00:34:57.260 --> 00:34:59.140
 (both laughing)

00:34:59.140 --> 00:34:59.980
 - Not bad, not bad.

00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:00.820
 - Sorry, I was thinking.

00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:01.660
 - Official secrecy.

00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:04.860
 - Yeah, 'cause like, who's grave was it?

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:06.340
 Were they blindfolded everyone?

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:07.980
 - I feel like it was Genghis Khan.

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:09.500
 - Yeah, or Attila, yeah.

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:10.820
 - Yeah.

00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:11.820
 - It was nighttime.

00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:13.900
 - Oh, that's good, that's good thinking.

00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:16.580
 - That's actually the, did they just use a pencil?

00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:17.420
 - Yeah.

00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:18.340
 - Oh, I was gonna do that one, yeah.

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:21.580
 - What it was is they were inside lead lined cabins

00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:23.740
 because the radio activity when this was being lowered

00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:26.740
 was more well known about and it was very high.

00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:29.240
 So they were following instructions over the radio.

00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:31.660
 They were basically doing pin the sarcophagus

00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:32.500
 on the reactor.

00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:33.340
 - Wow.

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:34.380
 - Like they were getting instructions

00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:36.020
 from people who were observing from a long distance.

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:36.860
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:37.700
 - And they just were doing it blind.

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:39.820
 - Left, left, no, mine left, no, mine left.

00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:41.740
 (both laughing)

00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:43.780
 - Okay, we're gonna need another sarcophagus now.

00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:45.580
 - Well, they did put a second one on in the end, didn't they?

00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:46.420
 - They did.

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:47.540
 - In fact, this is something we talked about

00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:49.900
 on No. 6 Things in the News, our short-lived TV show.

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:50.740
 - Oh yeah.

00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:51.580
 - Yeah.

00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:52.660
 - 'Cause I think it was around that time

00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:55.660
 when they put a new big bit of concrete over it

00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:57.220
 and it was like the biggest dome

00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:58.340
 that had ever been created.

00:35:58.340 --> 00:35:59.180
 - Is it concrete?

00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:00.780
 I thought it was, one of them was steel, right?

00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:02.220
 'Cause I felt like the first one was concrete

00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:03.540
 and that got dilapidated

00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:05.460
 and then they have now made this steel dome

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:08.300
 which I think is gonna last 100 years-ish.

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:09.940
 But it still feels like you're gonna have to set an alarm

00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:11.620
 for 100 years time when you've forgotten about it.

00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:12.940
 - It's just snoozing, isn't it, basically?

00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:13.940
 - Yeah.

00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:15.420
 - 'Cause it basically, it's Chernobyl turned into

00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:17.500
 basically a giant Russian doll.

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:18.340
 - Oh.

00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:20.420
 - It's just bigger and bigger, yeah.

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:22.220
 - Massive Ukrainian doll, we should say.

00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:23.460
 - Yeah, Ukrainian doll.

00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:25.780
 You can now, given that we're talking about alcohol

00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:28.740
 at Chernobyl, you can get a drink called Atomic

00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:30.940
 and I've ordered some of this, I love this.

00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:33.980
 It's harvested from apples from abandoned orchards

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:36.580
 in the local area, all of which are now producing apples

00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:39.060
 which are very low in radiation.

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:41.300
 So it's completely safe for consumption

00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:43.580
 and it goes to funding local bits of Ukraine

00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:45.700
 which have been, you know, severely hammered

00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:47.740
 not only by the nuclear reactor going off,

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:48.580
 but also by the war.

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:51.140
 And it's still being made and distributed, I believe, so.

00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:51.980
 - That's good, I know.

00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:54.180
 - I think it's you don't drink vodka, so.

00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:55.140
 - I'm gonna try.

00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:55.980
 - But good on you.

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:56.820
 - I'm gonna have a bag of apples,

00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:57.980
 it might be more like snaps.

00:36:57.980 --> 00:36:59.860
 - It's exactly, I think it is actually.

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:00.980
 I think it's basically snaps.

00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:02.140
 - Is it an apple sour?

00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:04.500
 - Yeah, it's an apple very sour, yeah.

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:07.260
 - It's amazing the fallout, how far it did travel.

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:09.540
 Like they have found a little layer

00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:12.140
 of radioactive materials at the bottom of Loch Ness,

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:13.540
 for example, which has come.

00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:14.380
 - Here we go.

00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:15.220
 - Hey, listen, I can't.

00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:16.540
 - Did the Beatles find it?

00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:17.380
 My only chance.

00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:22.780
 - They were in a yellow submarine on the menu each night.

00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:25.820
 - But no, do you know what's interesting?

00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:27.780
 Talking earlier about the sort of the experts

00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:30.020
 coming on and trying to downplay it.

00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:32.700
 As a result, people sort of started thinking,

00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:34.140
 actually, this might not be true.

00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:35.660
 And according to Natalia,

00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:37.220
 whose article I read about the experience

00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:38.260
 of living there at the time,

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:41.380
 she said everyone started experiencing radiophobia,

00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:43.980
 like her grandmother used to put iodine in her meals

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:46.420
 just to make sure that, yeah.

00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:48.340
 Then also parents were just,

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:49.700
 if they couldn't get out from where they were,

00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:51.700
 we're just putting their kids onto trains

00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:54.300
 with their names, and this is my name,

00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:56.260
 please look after me and just saying, go.

00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:57.940
 And they sent them out in further away,

00:37:57.940 --> 00:37:58.780
 in further away.

00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:00.020
 - 'Cause these weren't people in the exclusion zone,

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:02.500
 'cause the exclusion zone was completely evacuated.

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:03.580
 But people who were just close enough

00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:05.100
 that they thought, I'm really scared now.

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:06.060
 - Yeah, it just spread around there.

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:07.380
 Like how far did this travel?

00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:08.980
 - A lot of people in the UK were scared as well.

00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:09.820
 It's in all the newspapers.

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:12.260
 I probably would have been quite scared, yeah.

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:13.740
 - I got one of the letters that was sent out

00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:15.900
 to people living in the local area at the time.

00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:16.940
 It's really interesting the phrasing,

00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:18.740
 'cause they're trying to persuade people

00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:19.620
 to take some precautions,

00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:21.340
 but also trying to say, it's all fine.

00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:24.820
 So the letter begins, dear comrades, positive.

00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:26.260
 The result of detailed analysis showed

00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:27.620
 that living and working in your village

00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:29.980
 will cause no harm to adults or children.

00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:30.820
 Great news.

00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:32.540
 And then it said, we've got a few tips.

00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:35.620
 Do not eat berries and mushrooms gathered this year.

00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:37.340
 Children should not enter the forest.

00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:38.380
 Limit fresh greens.

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:39.820
 Remove topsoil from the garden

00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:41.380
 and bury it in specially prepared graves

00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:42.660
 far from the village.

00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:43.500
 But apart from that, you're all fine.

00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:45.660
 - I think mushrooms like are particularly bad, aren't they?

00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:48.580
 'Cause they sort of get the nutrients from the soil

00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:49.980
 and they can't really.

00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:50.820
 - Now.

00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:51.660
 - Is that not true?

00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:53.260
 - Is this where your mushroom thing comes from?

00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:54.900
 - Oh, maybe.

00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:57.420
 - You look at a mushroom and you see radiation.

00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:58.540
 You were alive at the time.

00:38:58.540 --> 00:38:59.380
 It was in the news.

00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:00.220
 - It's true, it's true.

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:01.980
 - There might have been a triggering incident.

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:02.820
 - Could have been.

00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:04.100
 That's usually the case, isn't it?

00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:04.940
 That's what they all say,

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:06.540
 that these people who are scared of bananas

00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:08.780
 must have had some terrible bananas.

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:09.620
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:10.780
 - There was a woman who was electrocuted

00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:13.220
 while looking at a bowl of bananas.

00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:14.060
 Sorry, it's not funny.

00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:14.900
 It's not funny.

00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:15.740
 - No.

00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:16.820
 - Like, got an electric shock.

00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:17.660
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:18.500
 - Electrocuted.

00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:19.340
 - Electrified.

00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:20.180
 - Well, she wasn't,

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:21.860
 she didn't convert to run on electricity.

00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:23.780
 (laughing)

00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:25.580
 It's a word we haven't worked out yet.

00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:26.860
 - Have you guys heard about this?

00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:27.900
 Many things about this.

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:30.860
 Samosally, they're the people who chose to return.

00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:33.820
 So about 1,200 people, after they're evacuated,

00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:34.780
 decided, you know what?

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:36.660
 My home's Chernobyl or the surrounding area.

00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:37.500
 I'm going back.

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:40.220
 And they went back and a couple of years that followed.

00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:42.900
 - Wow, like two, three years after.

00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:44.780
 - Like some of them went back months after.

00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:45.620
 A lot of them did.

00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:47.020
 And there are about 200 of them left.

00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:48.140
 And it's fascinating

00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:51.100
 'cause they're spread across about 164 villages.

00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:54.020
 So there were just over one person per village.

00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:56.340
 And they live extraordinary lives.

00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:58.460
 I was reading an interview with one called Ivan

00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:00.500
 who was remembering the time

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:02.220
 and said that, you know, they weren't really scared.

00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:03.740
 He remembered going and handing alcohol

00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:06.180
 to everyone there 'cause they all knew it would cure them.

00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:08.940
 And he lives in a village with two other women.

00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:10.780
 The journalist said, do you ever see them?

00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:12.260
 And he said, no, we almost never socialize.

00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:14.740
 - I'm really sorry to say this, but sitcom?

00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:19.020
 I know I say it all the time

00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:21.380
 when something like this terrible thing happens.

00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:22.340
 - But you think this is the one?

00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:23.820
 - I mean, one guy and two women

00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:25.140
 living in a village on the road

00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:27.460
 and they never like to speak to each other.

00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:30.340
 - It's a recipe for comedy.

00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:34.100
 - Did you see Bionerd, 23?

00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:34.940
 - What's that?

00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:37.220
 - She's someone who had a YouTube channel

00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:39.100
 and she made over 60 videos of her

00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:40.500
 going in the exclusion zone.

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:43.060
 And she would do things like pick apples off a tree

00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:44.460
 and take a bite into them.

00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:45.660
 But she was also a scientist.

00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:47.260
 And so she would show you that it was safe.

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:50.380
 But she hasn't posted, I think, in about five years now.

00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:51.540
 And she never gave her name

00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:53.380
 and no one really knows who she is.

00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:54.820
 So we don't know what's happened to her.

00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:58.020
 But she's a legit sort of YouTuber from back in the day.

00:40:58.020 --> 00:40:59.620
 - A legit YouTuber, what is a legit YouTuber?

00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:00.660
 - Well, she was a scientist

00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:03.140
 who was trying to show you that it's changed.

00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:03.980
 - Yeah, legit.

00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:05.300
 - 'Cause a legit YouTuber is just someone

00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:06.900
 who has a camera on their phone.

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:07.740
 - There it is, yeah.

00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:08.980
 - So everyone apart from you.

00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:11.140
 (all laughing)

00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:13.860
 There are a lot of dogs around Chernobyl today.

00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:17.220
 And they're genetically distinct from dogs

00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:19.620
 that are just about 10 or 20 miles away.

00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:21.020
 - Is that just they've mated with each other?

00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:21.980
 They've got their own clan.

00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:23.100
 And so they've become a little different.

00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:23.940
 - It honestly is that.

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:26.460
 It's just they've kept themselves to themselves.

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:29.020
 And the other dogs have kept themselves to themselves.

00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:30.780
 And they've lived apart for long enough

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:32.100
 that they have genetic markers

00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:33.580
 that are different between the two dogs now.

00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:34.420
 - Do they?

00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:35.260
 - Wow, that's incredible.

00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:36.100
 - That's interesting.

00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:38.500
 'Cause they're basically survivors of the cull, aren't they?

00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:39.980
 When one of the less,

00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:41.900
 well, all the jobs are quite unpleasant after it,

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:43.700
 but a specific police squad were sent in

00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:46.060
 to kill all the pets that were left in Chernobyl

00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:48.460
 so that they didn't go and spread.

00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:50.980
 - The idea is perhaps there was something about them

00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:53.500
 that made them able to survive the cull.

00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:55.740
 And that's like a slightly genetic difference

00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:57.420
 that has them, you know.

00:41:57.420 --> 00:41:58.260
 - Wow.

00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:01.860
 - The ability to hide under a sofa.

00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:02.700
 - But that's the same.

00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:05.740
 All the frogs around there are now black.

00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:06.580
 And this is very weird.

00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:08.420
 It's 'cause initially slightly darker frogs

00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:10.780
 were slightly likely to survive the radiation.

00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:13.060
 And this is how long ago, nearly 40 years now,

00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:15.420
 which is 10 to 15 frog generations.

00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:18.020
 So they have observed micro evolution even in this time.

00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:20.500
 And darker ones in the exclusion zone,

00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:21.340
 the frogs are all black now.

00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:25.300
 - I've read recently that gray squirrels are turning black.

00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:26.140
 - Is that so?

00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:27.340
 - We've got black squirrels around us.

00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:28.940
 And I always wonder what the hell they're doing there.

00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:31.860
 - Well, apparently they are more likely to survive

00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:35.060
 if they're dark because it means they can hide.

00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:36.980
 - I don't know what they blend in with.

00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:38.100
 - That's a bit depressing, isn't it?

00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:39.540
 - I read that in a study this week.

00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:41.580
 So actually, I just read the headline.

00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:43.540
 I haven't read the study yet.

00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:44.980
 - The hang on concrete is gray.

00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:46.420
 I would have thought gray squirrel or gray concrete

00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:47.940
 is perfect for them.

00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:49.940
 - And then you'll come, you get run over.

00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:52.300
 Black squirrel used to stand out.

00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:53.940
 - And is that why, do they want to stand out?

00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:55.580
 - I really wish I'd read this article now.

00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:57.620
 - No, it feels like it would have helped us a lot.

00:42:57.620 --> 00:42:58.460
 - That's just what you're like wildly,

00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:00.500
 it's what Dan's all the podcast is.

00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:03.080
 (upbeat music)

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:08.580
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show.

00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:09.740
 And that is my fact.

00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:13.900
 My fact this week is that the song "Take Me Home Country Roads"

00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:16.380
 was written by three people who had never been

00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:17.900
 to West Virginia.

00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:20.940
 Take Me Out to the Ball Game was written by two people

00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:23.420
 who had never been to a ball game.

00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:26.060
 And the Pina Collada song was written by one person

00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:27.260
 who had never drunk one.

00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:28.100
 - Lovely.

00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:29.260
 - A lot of this makes sense.

00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:31.340
 I mean, the reason you want to be taken to a ball game

00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:32.980
 'cause you've never been to one.

00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:33.820
 - Oh, that's true.

00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:34.660
 - That holds together, doesn't it?

00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:36.740
 - But on the other hand, "Take Me Home"

00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:38.820
 to West Virginia. - Doesn't play, yeah.

00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:40.180
 - That's tougher.

00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:42.060
 - So that famously is a John Denver song written

00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:46.420
 by three people, Bill Danoff, Taffy Nivert and John Denver.

00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:48.740
 The first two were in a band before

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:51.380
 and Danoff wrote that song "Afternoon Delight",

00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:52.220
 if you know that.

00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:53.740
 - My rock is in flight.

00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:54.580
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:43:54.580 --> 00:43:57.620
 If you've seen "Anchorman", you'll know that movie.

00:43:57.620 --> 00:43:58.820
 Sorry, you'll know that song.

00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:01.460
 But yeah, so they were riding around in their car

00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:04.140
 on Clopper Road in Montgomery County, Maryland.

00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:06.820
 And they had an idea for this song.

00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:07.660
 But it didn't scan.

00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:09.740
 - "Take Me Home", Clopper Road.

00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:11.580
 (all laughing)

00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:12.420
 - Yeah, it didn't scan.

00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:14.500
 And they were writing the lyrics one night

00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:17.220
 and John Denver happened to come over to their house

00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:18.660
 having busted his thumb

00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:20.780
 and gone to emergency hospital surgery.

00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:23.140
 He was sitting with them in their house early in the morning.

00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:25.060
 They'd planned to sell it to Johnny Cash.

00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:26.700
 And he started hearing the song.

00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:27.740
 He thought, "This is incredible."

00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:29.660
 And they stayed up all night writing the song.

00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:31.780
 And because none of them had been to West Virginia,

00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:33.380
 they got an encyclopedia down

00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:34.940
 and they had to look up all the details

00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:37.060
 in order to make the lyrics work.

00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:37.900
 - Is the rest of the song,

00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:40.140
 does it show an encyclopedic knowledge of West Virginia?

00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:40.980
 'Cause I've come over.

00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:43.900
 - Full violation, 384,000.

00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:46.540
 (all laughing)

00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:51.220
 - I heard that they basically liked the scanning

00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:54.020
 of Blue Ridge Mountains and Shenador River

00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:54.860
 and stuff like that.

00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:56.780
 They like these phrases.

00:44:56.780 --> 00:44:59.100
 And that's kind of why they went for West Virginia.

00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:00.420
 - 'Cause those are the famous bits.

00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:01.940
 If you just do the main population centers,

00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:03.620
 it's probably gonna be less romantic.

00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:06.140
 - Yeah, but also they were gonna use Massachusetts

00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:08.340
 'cause it's got four syllables as well.

00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:10.060
 Just looking for something with four syllables in it.

00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:12.700
 - Right, West Virginia, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:14.060
 What about this ball game thing?

00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:15.180
 - Oh, the ball game?

00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:18.100
 - Well, ball game, that was written in 1908

00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:20.220
 and that was written by a guy called Jack Norworth

00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:23.100
 and he wrote the lyrics and he brought the song,

00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:25.540
 the lyrics to this guy called Albert von Tilzer

00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:27.980
 and he put it to the tune that we now know it as.

00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:30.540
 Both of them had never been to a game before.

00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:33.140
 They would only go one of them 32 years later

00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:36.060
 after writing the song and then the other 20 years later

00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:38.300
 after writing the song, but it became popular

00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:40.060
 because it was an incredible announcer

00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:42.060
 for the Chicago White Sox.

00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:44.500
 He would announce their games called Harry Carrie.

00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:46.780
 Who used to sing it?

00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:47.940
 - We should just say that this is,

00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:49.820
 if you go to a baseball game,

00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:51.500
 they play it at every baseball game in America.

00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:53.220
 So that's why it's kind of famous.

00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:55.060
 - It's massive and they play it at the same point

00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:56.700
 as well as during the Seventh Innings.

00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:58.060
 - I don't think I know it.

00:45:58.060 --> 00:45:59.400
 Is it like the equivalent of like--

00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:01.100
 - I like thinking British people wouldn't know it.

00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:01.940
 - I don't know.

00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:04.460
 ♪ Take me out to the ball game ♪

00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:05.700
 - Wow, really?

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:06.780
 - British people would not know that song.

00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:08.900
 - It's just in so many American movies and--

00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:10.500
 - Is it the equivalent of the rare,

00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:12.060
 the referee, the wanker?

00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:12.900
 - That's it, yeah.

00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:14.420
 - It was their follow-up, it's just--

00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:15.940
 - That was actually written by a man

00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:17.260
 who had never masturbated.

00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:19.500
 (all laughing)

00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:21.140
 - A lot of people look back on this song now

00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:23.220
 because most people don't know the lyrics to the song,

00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:24.260
 certainly the first verse.

00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:25.340
 They just know "Take me out."

00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:27.300
 They know the main chorus, which is sung.

00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:29.980
 But it's pushed as a really progressive song

00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:30.900
 for women at the time.

00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:33.100
 And this was a result of he based it on,

00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:35.460
 he was having an affair at the time

00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:36.940
 with two vaudeville characters.

00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:41.060
 - His main girlfriend was someone called Trixie Fraganza,

00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:42.220
 who's also a bit--

00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:44.460
 - Sorry, Trixie, but not a real name.

00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:47.580
 - Before you say so, she was an outspoken suffragist

00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:49.020
 as well as a vaudeville.

00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:50.340
 - No good honest, incredible.

00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:51.900
 - Sounds like a suffragist's name,

00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:53.980
 doesn't it, Trixie Fraganza?

00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:57.580
 But she had, her most famous act was striptease,

00:46:57.580 --> 00:47:00.180
 where every time it looked like she was gonna take off

00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:02.020
 an item of clothing, she did,

00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:02.940
 but you never saw anything

00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:05.220
 'cause there was always more clothing underneath.

00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:06.060
 She would just keep going,

00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:07.660
 and there'd be more and more and more clothes.

00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:10.100
 - She's covered in layers of suffragist pamphlets.

00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:10.940
 - Yes.

00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:13.380
 - But it's pushed as a really progressive song

00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:14.300
 for women at the time.

00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:16.980
 And this was a result of him basing it on Trixie.

00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:20.180
 So the lyrics basically say she was baseball mad.

00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:21.580
 This was a time, 1908,

00:47:21.580 --> 00:47:23.100
 where women weren't going to baseball,

00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:24.940
 and it was, so it was a real push.

00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:25.980
 - Cool. - It was good.

00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:27.300
 - Go Trixie. - Aggressive.

00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:28.420
 - I won't hear a word against her.

00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:29.420
 - Okay, what was the last one?

00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:31.620
 - Oh, Pina Colada. - Pina Colada.

00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:32.540
 - Yeah, I love this.

00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:33.980
 - Yeah, well, do you wanna take over, Andy?

00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:38.380
 - Well, so Rupert Holmes from Northwich in Cheshire?

00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:39.340
 - Really? - Yeah.

00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:40.340
 - Who wrote the Pina Colada song?

00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:42.380
 - He wrote the Pina Colada song, Northwich.

00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:43.660
 - Lovely part of the world.

00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:44.980
 - Is it? I've never been.

00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:45.820
 - No.

00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:48.060
 - Well, it now has a Pina Colada festival every year.

00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:49.260
 - It does.

00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:50.700
 - And he had never had one.

00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:52.780
 And also it wasn't meant to be Pina Colada in the song.

00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:56.780
 Initially when he was writing it, it was Humphrey Bogart.

00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:57.780
 - Yeah.

00:47:57.780 --> 00:47:59.700
 - If you like Humphrey Bogart.

00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:02.220
 - If you like Humphrey Bogart.

00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:04.180
 - Yeah, you would have to say Humphrey Bogart.

00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:05.180
 - No, I think you can go,

00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:07.180
 if you like Humphrey Bogart.

00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:11.100
 - No, guys, if you like Humphrey Bogart, that's easy.

00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:13.660
 - If you like Humphrey Bogart.

00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:15.660
 - But so yeah, he just thought,

00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:17.140
 what is a nice sounding drink?

00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:18.500
 He had never had it.

00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:21.020
 And the sales were terrible of the song at first,

00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:22.940
 despite the song being mega popular.

00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:24.420
 So it's a great, it's a brilliant song.

00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:27.460
 It's about this guy who's bored of his lady.

00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:28.780
 And he posts--

00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:30.700
 - Are you gonna spoil a Pina Colada song now?

00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:32.540
 - I think I am actually.

00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:33.580
 He reads an advert in the newspaper.

00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:34.980
 - If you're halfway through listening

00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:38.540
 to the Pina Colada song, just turn off now.

00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:40.060
 - He reads this advert in the newspaper saying,

00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:42.980
 if you like Pina Colada and getting caught in the rain,

00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:45.100
 if you blah, blah, blah, blah, then, you know,

00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:46.100
 let's get together.

00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:49.380
 And then he turns up and it's his wife.

00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:51.780
 They realize they did love each other.

00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:54.420
 They are compatible, but anyway, whatever.

00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:55.260
 - What a lovely story.

00:48:55.260 --> 00:48:56.820
 - And the thing is, come with me and escape.

00:48:56.820 --> 00:48:58.540
 And the song is called Escape.

00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:00.020
 And everyone was listening on the radio.

00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:01.780
 The radio fans were going nuts for it.

00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:03.260
 DJs were playing it all the time,

00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:05.060
 but no one was buying it 'cause they could not remember

00:49:05.060 --> 00:49:06.380
 the name of the song.

00:49:06.380 --> 00:49:07.220
 - Oh my God.

00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:08.060
 - It was what's that song?

00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:09.500
 It's the, oh, you know, the Pina Colada song.

00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:10.340
 And then his record label--

00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:11.780
 - How helpful were shopkeepers in those days?

00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:14.620
 If you went in and said, what's the song about Pina Colada?

00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:15.940
 And they're like, what's the seal?

00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:17.660
 - Nope, nope, never heard of that.

00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:18.660
 Nope.

00:49:18.660 --> 00:49:20.300
 - And his record label put,

00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:24.700
 his record label put on escape brackets of the Pina Colada song.

00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:26.500
 - I just love the idea of him saying,

00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:28.580
 unless you say the exact correct name,

00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:29.580
 I'm not gonna get it.

00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:31.380
 - A lot of record shots were starved

00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:33.180
 by Rumpelstiltskin in those days.

00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:35.340
 (both laughing)

00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:36.820
 But the record label added those brackets,

00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:38.740
 literally escape brackets, the Pina Colada song,

00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:40.380
 and it went quadruple platinum.

00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:42.780
 - Really? - It just went nuts, yeah, yeah.

00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:46.940
 - On sort of songs that don't fit their writers,

00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:49.180
 which I suppose is the topic of this,

00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:50.380
 a hard one to research.

00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:53.380
 But the famous one really is the Barry Manilow song,

00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:56.020
 I Write the Songs, which he didn't write.

00:49:56.020 --> 00:50:00.140
 It was actually written by Bruce Johnson of The Beach Boys.

00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:02.340
 - Wow. - Which I hadn't realized.

00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:03.980
 And Manilow did say at the time

00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:05.340
 that he knew that he would be in trouble

00:50:05.340 --> 00:50:06.900
 as soon as his producer handed it to him.

00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:08.780
 And he said, look, I know that I'm gonna get in shit

00:50:08.780 --> 00:50:10.460
 for this 'cause I didn't write it.

00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:12.540
 But have you ever heard the Barry Manilow song?

00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:13.900
 I really do write the songs.

00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:14.740
 - No. (both laughing)

00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:17.140
 - It's really good. - I love a song sequel.

00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:19.380
 - It's so good, so it's a spoof,

00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:21.340
 basically responding to all his critics who were saying,

00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:23.100
 but he didn't write, I write the songs.

00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:26.100
 And it's a manual for how to write a song.

00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:29.340
 So it has lyrics like, you start off with the verse,

00:50:29.340 --> 00:50:30.540
 and that's the part that tells you

00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:32.420
 what the song's gonna be about.

00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:34.260
 And you can talk about dope or death,

00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:36.020
 but love is probably the best.

00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:37.580
 It's better than this, the actual lyrics.

00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:38.700
 - It does sound like they have used

00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:40.700
 an encyclopedia entry for that one.

00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:42.540
 (both laughing)

00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:44.220
 - You know the thing with I Write the Songs?

00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:46.100
 He didn't want to sing it

00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:48.900
 because he wanted to write his own songs.

00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:52.740
 And he was presented with it by his producer.

00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:55.860
 And it's the singer of the song is the spirit of music.

00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:58.100
 It's actually from the perspective of music itself.

00:50:58.100 --> 00:50:59.420
 I write the songs, right?

00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:01.820
 Like I'm the inspiration for the channel.

00:51:01.820 --> 00:51:03.140
 But when he read the lyrics, he thought,

00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:04.940
 this just sounds like me, Barry Manilow,

00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:06.300
 singing I write the songs.

00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:07.540
 And that's what people interpret it as.

00:51:07.540 --> 00:51:08.980
 So I don't want to do that.

00:51:08.980 --> 00:51:12.380
 And Bruce Johnson said, no, this is God narrating the song.

00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:14.380
 - And it's gonna come off as much better

00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:15.220
 if you're speaking as God.

00:51:15.220 --> 00:51:17.220
 - Yeah, he really didn't want to sing it

00:51:17.220 --> 00:51:19.020
 until he was strong armed into it by his producer.

00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:20.340
 And then went to number one.

00:51:20.340 --> 00:51:22.220
 - I think he quite enjoyed it.

00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:24.740
 As in, I think now, like doing that piss take

00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:25.940
 that ends in the climax.

00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:27.460
 Sometimes I really do write the songs.

00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:28.580
 And he does refer to it.

00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:29.820
 I feel like he's taken it quite well.

00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:32.100
 You could have got quite pissed off about that tension.

00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:34.140
 I'm not like Frank Sinatra actually did a version,

00:51:34.140 --> 00:51:35.380
 which I didn't know.

00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:36.780
 And he insisted on changing the lyrics

00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:39.860
 to I sing the songs, which I think is a bit of a cop out.

00:51:39.860 --> 00:51:40.700
 - Yeah, it is.

00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:43.460
 - Do you guys know the song Girls Just Wanna Have Fun?

00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:44.660
 - Of course. - Love it.

00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:45.580
 Cindy Lauper.

00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:47.540
 - Well, she didn't write it.

00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:50.300
 It was written by a man called Robert Hazard.

00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:54.300
 And the amazing thing is not only did he write it,

00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:55.940
 he also sang it.

00:51:55.940 --> 00:51:57.940
 And he sang the same lyrics more or less.

00:51:57.940 --> 00:52:00.100
 It's slightly different, but they're more or less the same.

00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:02.780
 But when you listen to them, how he sang them,

00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:04.620
 it's got a really different meaning.

00:52:04.620 --> 00:52:05.460
 - I bet.

00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:07.580
 - So if you think about it, my daddy said,

00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:09.300
 "What are you gonna do with your life?

00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:10.620
 "You're not the fortunate one.

00:52:10.620 --> 00:52:11.820
 "Girls just wanna have fun."

00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:13.300
 What he's saying is,

00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:15.300
 "I'm not gonna care what I'm doing in my life.

00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:17.620
 "I'm going out and I'm gonna sleep with a load of women

00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:19.500
 "because they just wanna have fun."

00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:21.940
 - Fair enough.

00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:22.780
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:23.620
 But it's a different song.

00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:24.460
 - It's a very different song.

00:52:24.460 --> 00:52:25.420
 - It's a different tone, isn't it?

00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:26.700
 - Yeah, yeah, definitely.

00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:27.900
 - I think "I'm Every Woman"

00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:29.980
 was also largely written by a man.

00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:30.820
 - Was it?

00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:31.940
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:52:31.940 --> 00:52:33.060
 - What do you mean largely written?

00:52:33.060 --> 00:52:35.020
 Like, he wrote "I'm Every Man."

00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:36.500
 Someone had to do the WO.

00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:37.420
 - I think it was co-written,

00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:38.620
 but he wrote most of the lyrics.

00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:39.460
 - Oh, really?

00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:40.300
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:43.680
 - I do know that respect R-E-S-P-E-C-T.

00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:45.580
 Indeed, Ari Frankes,

00:52:45.580 --> 00:52:48.980
 which was a big feminist anthem, obviously,

00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:50.460
 and a civil rights anthem.

00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:53.580
 But that was originally written about a man

00:52:53.580 --> 00:52:55.500
 saying, "My wife's got to respect me

00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:58.900
 when I come home tired from work after a long, old day."

00:52:58.900 --> 00:53:00.740
 And yeah.

00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:01.580
 - Oh, wow.

00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:02.420
 - She just reclaimed it.

00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:04.220
 - One little tweak, yeah, yeah.

00:53:04.220 --> 00:53:05.180
 - Yeah.

00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:06.700
 - My favorite one's always been that

00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:08.620
 the song "It Wasn't Me" by Shaggy.

00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:10.260
 15 years after the song was released,

00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:12.260
 he revealed that it was in fact him.

00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:14.140
 He was the cheater in the song.

00:53:14.140 --> 00:53:15.540
 - 'Cause it's about someone cheating.

00:53:15.540 --> 00:53:16.380
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:19.260
 It's actually used legally now as the Shaggy defense.

00:53:19.260 --> 00:53:21.500
 - It's where you got irrefutable evidence

00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:22.620
 that you did something and you just say,

00:53:22.620 --> 00:53:23.460
 "No, I didn't do it."

00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:24.620
 - Exactly, yeah.

00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:25.460
 The Shaggy defense.

00:53:25.460 --> 00:53:26.300
 - The toddler defense.

00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:27.140
 - It's a bad defense.

00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:28.140
 - It's a Trump defense.

00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:28.980
 - Look at this, yeah.

00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:31.260
 - Toto, you can guess what I'm about to say about them.

00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:32.460
 - Africa, they've never been to Africa.

00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:34.940
 - Yeah, and this is David Page, who wrote,

00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:36.740
 I was reading about, I basically thought,

00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:38.500
 "I bet Toto had never been to Africa."

00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:42.180
 And I looked at Africa and they hadn't when they wrote it.

00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:44.620
 And the guy who wrote it was a member of the band

00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:45.460
 called David Page.

00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:47.660
 And he sounds quite arrogant.

00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:49.940
 He said he was humming the melody

00:53:49.940 --> 00:53:51.540
 and then the words came to him

00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:52.740
 and he thought to himself,

00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:55.260
 "Hang on, I'm a very talented songwriter,

00:53:55.260 --> 00:53:57.220
 "but even I'm not this talented,

00:53:57.220 --> 00:53:59.860
 "our higher power is writing through me."

00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:01.180
 - That God again.

00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:03.100
 - That bloody God he gets everywhere.

00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:05.380
 And he used descriptions that he'd read

00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:06.420
 in National Geographic.

00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:09.220
 And I think he'd read a biography of Dr. Livingston

00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:10.940
 to get his Africa...

00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:15.500
 - Okay, we'll just bang up to the minute

00:54:15.500 --> 00:54:17.900
 for the very latest news out of the continent.

00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:19.820
 - He'd basically been, I think we can say.

00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:21.260
 - Are there any brilliant Congress lyrics in the song?

00:54:21.260 --> 00:54:22.460
 I can't remember how it goes.

00:54:22.460 --> 00:54:23.780
 - There are a few.

00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:25.420
 - I hear the reins down in Africa, is that it?

00:54:25.420 --> 00:54:26.260
 - Yeah.

00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:27.900
 - The Serengeti is in the wrong place.

00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:29.300
 I can't remember what the lyric is.

00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:30.340
 Like something rises over,

00:54:30.340 --> 00:54:31.540
 a mountain rises over the Serengeti.

00:54:31.540 --> 00:54:33.980
 Kill the manjaro over the Serengeti, I think.

00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:34.820
 Which isn't...

00:54:34.820 --> 00:54:35.980
 - It's not too far away, isn't it?

00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:38.300
 - It's not too far away.

00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:39.540
 - Close enough.

00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:40.580
 It's all Africa.

00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:41.780
 Yeah, okay, got it.

00:54:41.780 --> 00:54:44.100
 - He didn't admit that he hadn't been.

00:54:44.100 --> 00:54:46.340
 And then he went in the late 1990s.

00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:47.540
 So he wrote it in 1982.

00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:49.260
 Then they toured in South Africa.

00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:51.860
 And apparently he said when he was touring South Africa,

00:54:51.860 --> 00:54:54.420
 all the South Africans ran up to him and said,

00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:56.060
 "Wow, so when were you in Africa?"

00:54:56.060 --> 00:54:58.020
 And when he said he wasn't, they said,

00:54:58.020 --> 00:55:00.620
 "But you described it so perfectly."

00:55:00.620 --> 00:55:03.180
 - The way that the pyramids reflect the beauties

00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:05.100
 of Johannesburg, it's incredible.

00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:07.780
 - The other toto.

00:55:07.780 --> 00:55:09.540
 Sorry, I've just got one more thing about the other toto.

00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:10.380
 - Yeah?

00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:11.220
 - The toto of the dog.

00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:12.700
 Wizard of Oz.

00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:13.700
 What's the famous song?

00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:15.100
 - We're off to see the wizard.

00:55:15.100 --> 00:55:15.940
 - Oh, sorry.

00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:17.260
 - Somewhere over the rainbow.

00:55:17.260 --> 00:55:20.740
 - Oh my God, the author had never seen a rainbow.

00:55:20.740 --> 00:55:21.980
 - I shouldn't have picked a film

00:55:21.980 --> 00:55:24.580
 which is banger after banger after banger.

00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:26.140
 Somewhere over the rainbow is the song I'm thinking of.

00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:27.860
 There were concerns about that song.

00:55:27.860 --> 00:55:29.380
 Can you guess why?

00:55:29.380 --> 00:55:32.820
 So it's an ecosystem based on selling sheet music.

00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:35.620
 Studio executives were very nervous about this song.

00:55:35.620 --> 00:55:36.460
 - Is it 'cause it's a set?

00:55:36.460 --> 00:55:37.860
 It's very short.

00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:40.220
 - It's because of the way the notes muck around.

00:55:40.220 --> 00:55:41.740
 There's an octave leap.

00:55:41.740 --> 00:55:43.060
 Somewhere.

00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:46.780
 And it's really, it's hard for amateur singers

00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:47.620
 to sing that well.

00:55:47.620 --> 00:55:48.780
 And the studio bosses were like,

00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:50.700
 "No one's going to buy the sheet music.

00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:52.980
 "This is junk, change it."

00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:54.340
 - 'Cause you can't sing along to it easily.

00:55:54.340 --> 00:55:55.180
 - Pretty much, yeah.

00:55:55.180 --> 00:55:57.580
 And so therefore that would damage their margins of the film.

00:55:57.580 --> 00:55:59.020
 - How interesting.

00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:01.780
 I think I should shout out to our colleague, James Rawson,

00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:03.220
 who I appealed to for this fact.

00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:05.900
 And he just really wants to air something

00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:06.900
 that's annoyed him for years,

00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:10.700
 which is the Alicia Keys debut album Songs in A Minor,

00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:11.900
 which was a great album.

00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:13.540
 (all laughing)

00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:14.380
 - Where's this going?

00:56:14.380 --> 00:56:15.820
 (all laughing)

00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:16.660
 - You might remember.

00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:17.500
 - I'm not songs.

00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:19.620
 - They're all the A Minor, it's fine.

00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:21.180
 Yeah, there's only...

00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:23.980
 Well, the internet says there's only one song in A Minor

00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:25.660
 and I wasted quite a lot of time.

00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:28.660
 I'm not very good at the piano, putting Spotify on,

00:56:28.660 --> 00:56:30.300
 and then working out what key they're all in.

00:56:30.300 --> 00:56:32.260
 And I think there are two songs in A Minor on it,

00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:34.580
 but it's still not all of the songs.

00:56:34.580 --> 00:56:36.340
 It's only two out of 16.

00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:37.660
 So Alicia...

00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:38.500
 - That's great.

00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:39.860
 - Sort yourself out.

00:56:39.860 --> 00:56:42.060
 And then I learned you had a son called Egypt,

00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:43.260
 but he has been to Egypt.

00:56:43.260 --> 00:56:44.660
 (all laughing)

00:56:44.660 --> 00:56:46.660
 - But in fairness, she's called Alicia Keys.

00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:48.900
 So obviously it's going to be in different keys.

00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:49.740
 - Brilliant.

00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:50.580
 - That's a good point.

00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:51.500
 She's pulled it back.

00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:54.060
 (all laughing)

00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:56.380
 - Here's an interesting thing.

00:56:56.380 --> 00:56:58.460
 The song Ain't No Sunshine by Bill Withers.

00:56:58.460 --> 00:56:59.860
 - Yep. - Oh yeah.

00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:01.500
 - Is Unfinished.

00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:02.460
 - Is it? - Yeah.

00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:03.300
 - Really?

00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:04.140
 'Cause it just goes,

00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:06.700
 ♪ I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know ♪

00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:08.700
 And I've never got to the end of that bit.

00:57:08.700 --> 00:57:10.180
 - That's the bit.

00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:12.420
 He got to the recording booth with the song Unfinished

00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:14.100
 and he just improvised,

00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:15.860
 ♪ I know, I know, I know, I know, I know ♪

00:57:15.860 --> 00:57:18.140
 And he was like, "I'll do this later."

00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:20.260
 - It walked out the booth so it sounded like a fade.

00:57:20.260 --> 00:57:21.620
 (all laughing)

00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:22.460
 - Is that true?

00:57:22.460 --> 00:57:23.660
 - Yeah. - That's really funny.

00:57:23.660 --> 00:57:25.340
 - Well, thinking it'll come to me in the moment,

00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:26.180
 it's fine. - Yeah.

00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:28.140
 (all laughing)

00:57:28.140 --> 00:57:28.980
 - That's great.

00:57:28.980 --> 00:57:29.980
 - But yeah, if you listen long enough,

00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:31.140
 it goes, "No, I don't know."

00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:33.340
 (all laughing)

00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:35.920
 (upbeat music)

00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:39.340
 - Okay, that's it.

00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:40.300
 That is all of our facts.

00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:41.620
