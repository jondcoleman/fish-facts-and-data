1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
 We run it on QI a few years ago. Yeah. Which was there's no such thing as a fish.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,600
 It's a nice such thing as a fish. No, seriously. It's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,480
 It says it right there. First paragraph. No such thing as a fish.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:23,200
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,520
 from the QI offices in Covern Garden. My name is Dan Shriver. I'm sitting here with three

6
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:32,640
 of the regular elves. It is James Harkin, Anne Chazinski and Andy Murray. And once again,

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,040
 we've got our four favorite facts from the last seven days and here they are in no particular order.

8
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:43,520
 James, starting with you. What's your fact? Okay, my fact this week is that the head of the

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,920
 International Chess Federation believes that chess was brought to earth by aliens.

10
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,520
 And he should know. Yeah. What kind of evidence does he have for that?

11
00:00:54,240 --> 00:01:00,880
 He has first hand evidence because he was abducted by aliens in 1997 and shown around the galaxy.

12
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:08,080
 And they told him the earth is set to collide with the planet Nibiru, killing us all if mankind does

13
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:14,080
 not cleanse its aura by playing more chess. That was it. In an interview in Time Magazine. That was.

14
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:21,600
 What's his name again? Mr. Ilyum Jinoff. He's a politician as well. He's the head of the

15
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,760
 Kalminkir province of Russia and he has friends such as Chuck Norris and he was friends with

16
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:33,760
 Salam Hussein. He's friends with David Ike. Why do these political guys? All these sort of like

17
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:40,320
 eccentric characters always have an American action hero as a good mate. They all have Chuck Norris

18
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:46,080
 being his mate or like Kim Jong Un having Dennis Rodney. Yeah. I guess it's like a trophy friend.

19
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:52,880
 Trophy American mate for some kind of buddy movie that may erupt one. Any biography movie done

20
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,560
 of a big political leader of our time is effectively going to come out like rush hour.

21
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:04,160
 Chuck Norris just quickly on him. I read this thing whereby he despite being in violent movies,

22
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,560
 hates that his kids would have to watch violent movies but they all want to watch his movies.

23
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,760
 So he does this thing where he edits out all the fight scenes from his movies and lets his kids

24
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,280
 watch that and I cannot think of anything more painful than watching a Chuck Norris movie without the

25
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,080
 fighting scenes. Yeah. Do they think that he's in a load of 26-minute-long feature films?

26
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:32,000
 Just back to this guy, Mr. Ilyum Jinoff, he said that aliens gave us chess. That's one thing but he

27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,440
 also said they gave us something else. Anyone know what it is? No. What is it? A technology

28
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,680
 or an illness or a body part? No. Sweetcorn. He says they gave a sweetcorn but he says it was a

29
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,560
 different civilization that gave us sweetcorn. Maybe the Aztecs are the Incans or something.

30
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,880
 And are they threatening the world with destruction unless we eat as much sweetcorn as he is

31
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:58,160
 only possible? Do you know what? He's been more asked about the chess donation from space

32
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,680
 than he knows the sweetcorn. I can't find anything else out there. You know what guys? I was really

33
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,120
 hoping this was going to be about chess. Can I tell you the fact about chess? Yes, please.

34
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:14,080
 Okay. In 1999 Gary Kasperov, obviously great chess champion, played the world at chess. Oh yeah.

35
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,760
 He played 50,000 different people from more than 75 countries in one game. So they also

36
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,960
 met a vote on what move they should take as a team and whichever move received most votes was the

37
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:30,000
 move that the world made against Gary Kasperov. After four months the game ended at move 62,

38
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:39,120
 when 51% of the world's team voted to resign. 49% must have been levied. Yeah. But they weren't even

39
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,880
 acting on that. So 50,000 people, but they weren't even on their own even as 50,000. They had four

40
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:49,200
 chess experts guiding them, acting as world team coaches and suggesting moves and strategies.

41
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:57,280
 So even with expert help, 50,000 people cannot be Gary Kasperov. Gary Kasperov, so famously he

42
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,160
 obviously had the two matches against deep blue, the Supercomputer, the latter of which was in 9,

43
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:07,040
 so he won the first one, which was a set of six games. And then in 1997 he played another set of six

44
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:14,000
 games. And in the first game of the six he won, but he basically had a mental breakdown after

45
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,520
 the finish because the computer had done what he thought was a completely ingenious move that even he

46
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:25,360
 couldn't understand. So Gary Kasperov was winning, but the computer moved a rook in a really random

47
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,440
 position. And Gary Kasperov couldn't work out why that possibly would make any computing sense.

48
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,520
 So suddenly he went, "Oh my god, I can't work out the logic of what this computer is doing. It

49
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,480
 must be better than me." And that was the last game that he ever won against the computer because

50
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:45,200
 he became so frightened that this has superhuman intelligence. And actually one of the computer engineers

51
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:51,600
 admitted to Nate Silver 15 years later that there was a bug in the computer and it just resulted

52
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,840
 to randomly moving a piece, totally at random. It would have been better if someone had just moved

53
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:01,040
 the horse in the wrong way. He's like, "Yes, that would have been a horror baby." Just knocked the

54
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,400
 table over. "Oh my god, you can move a horse three up and five across." "I have no one tell me this."

55
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,560
 He thought it was a sign that there were humans intervening with the computer.

56
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,920
 Oh yeah, and he thought they were very interesting. Just about your thing about Kasperov versus the

57
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:23,440
 world and there's, "I can go one better on that," which is the first ever world chess champion

58
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:30,640
 was called Bill Helm Steinitz and he was a great player and he beat everyone and then he started to

59
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:37,280
 slightly lose his marbles a little bit and he challenged God to a match and he would play God quite

60
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:43,360
 often and he quite often beat God and he got so much better than God that he would start giving God

61
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,360
 like a pawn extra to try and make it a bit more even. When you say he beat God? Yeah, it was God playing.

62
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,480
 Well, I think he was slightly schizophrenic so he was getting the moves himself and go,

63
00:05:54,480 --> 00:06:01,280
 "Oh, God did that. Oh, God, you idiot!" And so he would be God and very sadly, he ended up in a

64
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:07,280
 mental asylum and died penniless. He was the first ever chess champion called Bill Helm Steinitz.

65
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,160
 There is a debate about where the chess makes you mad or not. There's a really good

66
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,600
 Nabokov quote about the fact that everyone who plays chess must eventually go insane. But my

67
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,800
 favorite chess player is this guy called Nathan Shoransky who is now an Israeli politician, I think,

68
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,400
 but he was a human rights campaigner in Soviet Russia and he was a childhood chess prodigy

69
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,640
 and he was put in a Siberian prison in 1977 for nine years and he said chess kept him sane. So he

70
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:38,080
 was in this tiny freezing-cold cell, slightly given any food. It was completely dark. There was

71
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,160
 absolutely nothing in the cell just stone and he just played chess in his head against himself

72
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,280
 for nine years and said that that was the only way that he survived it.

73
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,240
 Well, that kept him sane. Yeah. I think it's in a round. They banned the, you know, when you get

74
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,720
 the pawn to the end and you can turn it into a queen. Yeah. I think they banned that move because

75
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,600
 it promoted bigamy because then the king had two wives. Surely it would be promoting transvestism.

76
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:06,320
 Are you assuming that pawns are men? Yes, I am. Are they? I don't know. I'm comfortable with that.

77
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:11,840
 Queens used to only be able to move less like they could only move one space like in any direction.

78
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,960
 Yeah, they were rubbish. They were the worst. And then they could move like knights for a while

79
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,920
 for some reason, which is kind of bizarre because you would have thought knights could move like that

80
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:22,320
 because their horses. Queen could do it too. Sorry. Just the logic is like, well, they're on horses,

81
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,920
 so that makes sense. She has never struck me that doesn't make sense, doesn't it? The knight's

82
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,920
 can move too. The horses can jump over. I think they can jump over a base. Yeah, they can jump,

83
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,320
 but there's no particular reason why a horse could would move too forward and one to the side.

84
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,320
 At the same time, the evil carnivals of the chess world. Do you guys, when you play Monopoly,

85
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,040
 are you going, okay, I'm going to get the car because that moves faster than a hat.

86
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:46,880
 This is a bit too much logic. Oh, I get a battleship. Blow up the iron. Yeah,

87
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,520
 when you see them, they brought out new pieces for the Monopoly board. Yeah, they brought in a cat

88
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,840
 last year, didn't they? Yeah, they've got rid of the iron or the old boot, possibly, and replaced it

89
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:02,080
 with a cat. But is it? Sorry, go on, Andy. Sorry, just on the Monopoly thing, the cat won a vote,

90
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:08,000
 a popular online vote, and it beat a robot helicopter diamond ring and a guitar. And one of the guys

91
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,120
 from Hasbro said, I think there were a lot of cat lovers in the world that reached out. They're always

92
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:19,760
 bloody reaching out. Robot should have won. King Canute, who we all know, turned back the waves.

93
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:26,560
 He once had a chess game with an Earl of his called Earl Ulf, and he did a move. I think it was a

94
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,880
 nice move, but he realized it was a bad one. Try to take it back. Earl Ulf said, no, you can't do that.

95
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:38,320
 It turned into a massive argument. Can you tip up the table, went off in a half, and then had Earl

96
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:44,480
 Ulf killed? Wow. Napoleon got really angry playing chess. Well, according to one account, Napoleon

97
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,600
 got really angry playing chess against the mechanical Turk, didn't he? Yeah, we should explain who the

98
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,480
 mechanical Turk was. Yeah, so the mechanical Turk was a fake chess machine that existed between

99
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:02,160
 1770 and 1854, and it was theoretically, it was this robot that was dressed up like a Turk,

100
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,760
 and it managed to beat Napoleon, Franklin, Babbage, other famous people at chess, and it sort of

101
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,880
 toured the globe, and it was this Turkish man with a huge box on which he had a chess board,

102
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,040
 that he apparently played by some robotic power. So I don't know why no one ever said, hey,

103
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,920
 can this Turk play without the huge box? Because inside the huge box under the chess board was

104
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,480
 obviously a guy who was controlling the chess pieces. Why does our box keep sneezing? Yeah.

105
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:34,320
 What? Maybe this is why the robot's not allowed on the monopoly boy. All games have been banned from.

106
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:41,680
 Gays Napoleon puts into death. But yeah, at one point in Napoleon, I think, wrapped a shawl around

107
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,880
 the mechanical Turk's head so that he wouldn't be able to see the board, which obviously didn't make

108
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:54,000
 a blind bit of difference. There was another famous chess player who always had excuses, and he'd lost

109
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,800
 five games in a row. He was five nil down, and he said, oh, the first one I lost because I had two

110
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,880
 thugs, and the second one I lost because I had a headache, and the third one I lost because I had

111
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,680
 rheumatism in my legs, and the fourth one I lost because it just wasn't feeling very well,

112
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,800
 and then they said, oh, why did you lose the fifth one? And he said, what, am I expected to win every game?

113
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:23,040
 That was like when David Hay, after his match where he lost his eye arch, you know, I twisted my ankle

114
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:29,040
 this morning, and that was his excuse. No, he broke a toe. He broke a toe. I broke my toe,

115
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:35,200
 and I really affected how I punched with my arms. I just wish I'd learn. Oh, yeah, come on,

116
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,320
 that's all right. Yeah. What, you toe? Yeah, you can't move. Can be really painful. No, he was,

117
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,360
 he was fine. Can I just say if David Hayes listening, I believe you. Oh, me too, actually.

118
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,480
 Yeah. Sorry, David. I don't, but I don't know who you are. I thought you were a chess player.

119
00:10:50,480 --> 00:11:00,320
 Come on, let's bring weedy chess player Hay over here. This is rash. I broke his other toe.

120
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:09,200
 Okay, time for fact number two, and that is my fact. My fact this week concerns the Greenland shark,

121
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,760
 which is a shark I didn't know existed until a few days ago. What I love about it is the Greenland

122
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:20,480
 shark is so slow that it basically needs all of his food to be asleep in order to eat it,

123
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,840
 because otherwise if it can move, anything can out swim it because its fastest speed is one mile per

124
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:31,440
 hour. Why is this slow? Because it's in cold water, and so it needs to preserve all of its energy,

125
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,760
 and so on. They can do a little burst of speed. Are they the sharks? They can, but when they say,

126
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,520
 when they, in everything I've read, I could be, if someone out there knows any different, because

127
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:45,760
 I'd love to know, apparently with the bursts of speed, they can only get up to about 1.6 miles

128
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,400
 and that's their burst of speed. That's amazing. Yeah, it's not as much a burst, is it? They're

129
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,320
 amazing looking. They're 20 feet long as well. They're huge. Yeah, they're ginormous. Yeah.

130
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:00,000
 So it eats seals, the Greenland shark, and the problem with eating seals is that it's fine if they

131
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,520
 can manage to get the seal, but the seal can swim at two miles per hour. So it's always just in front

132
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:10,560
 of this shark who's given it its all gone gone. It's not always just in front. It's always increasing

133
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,800
 its distance. That's true. That's true. That's right. A mile every hour. So basically they have to wait

134
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:20,960
 to find a sleeping seal, and here's the thing. The seals are their main predator or the polar bearers

135
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:26,160
 up on the ice, and they would rather be in the ocean and risk being asleep, because they can probably

136
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,800
 have a good sleep. Notice a shark on its way, and by the time it wakes up, it can still get away. Yeah,

137
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:36,800
 you could press snooze quite a few times before it gets you could. But their extraordinary creatures,

138
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,720
 just generally, their skin is poisonous. I don't know if I've read about that within any other

139
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,800
 sharks. Not the rest of them too, the flesh as well. That's sorry. Yeah, yeah, so they're completely

140
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,280
 poisonous. We couldn't eat them. And do you know what it does to you if you eat it? Do you know

141
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:54,640
 the effects it has? What's the poison? The poison. So the poison is try methylene oxide, and so if

142
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,960
 you eat the flesh of the shark, that has the effect of extreme drunkenness. Does it? So if you

143
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,360
 manage to not eat too much, then you can just get really pissed. Oh, so it's like licking a toad,

144
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,440
 except if you don't like drugs and you like alcohol. Yeah, exactly. Wow, like a hallucinogenic toad.

145
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,920
 You can lick this shark. Looking, I think you'd have a nibble. You can't cook it, though. There are

146
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:19,920
 ways of preparing it properly, but it's a very disgusting way of cooking it. You have to bury the meat

147
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,800
 in the ground for it's one of these, is it? Yeah, for six to twelve weeks, and then you expose it

148
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,720
 every so often, and you thaw it out, and then you freeze it again. Then you have to hang it up to

149
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,720
 try it for several months, and then you finally cut it into bite-sized cubes. Well, I think in order to

150
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,200
 eat that, you'd have to be pretty drunk. Yeah, and it says the end product, which is called

151
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:43,200
 a heckarl, or a heckarl, is a delicacy, which is the universal way of describing foods that are

152
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:50,480
 horrible, but rare. They can live, these sharks can live up to 200 years, they think. No, that can't

153
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,280
 be right. Yeah, this is what they say. They know this because scientists have said that they can

154
00:13:55,280 --> 00:14:00,240
 live up to roughly 200 years of age. They know this because they measure how much they grow per year,

155
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,520
 and they only grow about one, between half and one centimeter per year, and so they found them the

156
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:10,560
 size of great white sharks, and they made an assumption that that's how large they can get. It's really

157
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,040
 weird how little we know about this shark as well. They were only first photographed in 1995, and the

158
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:20,720
 first bit of actual footage of them is from 2003. So they're kind of this new species to us, really.

159
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:27,440
 It was actually thought that sharks, in general, died in their 20s, but then they did radioactive tests

160
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,240
 on them because the radiation that went from the nuclear test into the environment meant that you

161
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,280
 can test how old things are, and they found that sharks now routinely live into their 70s. At

162
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:42,240
 least. Wow. Wow. Okay. Yeah. That's such a strange thought, isn't it, elderly shark? They have found

163
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,240
 inside the Greenland shark, haven't they? Some pretty impressive animals given that they move so

164
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:51,440
 slowly. They think that they've got, they found reindeer and they found really fast moving seals inside

165
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:57,120
 it. A lion, a cheetah. A polar bear. A polar bear. A polar bear. It's found inside one of them. Yeah,

166
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:04,000
 they, which is weird. They basically eat everything because they don't have many options of living things

167
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,560
 to eat because everything can swim away. They're genuinely, they're scavengers. They just, if they see

168
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,680
 something dead and it looks edible, they will eat it because that's, their, their three options are,

169
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:19,280
 it's either asleep, it's dead or it's swam into my face. Those are the three eating options that they have.

170
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:27,200
 I want to talk about some slow chases. Okay. Yeah. So in, I don't know when this was. A few years ago,

171
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:36,000
 there was a news report of a guy called Mr. Smith who stole a JCB and then he drove off at 10 to

172
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,400
 15 miles an hour. The police were called. They started chasing him, but then realized that he was

173
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:47,600
 just going and they couldn't stop him. And so the, the policeman got out and chased him on foot.

174
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:57,280
 And he said, I was able to keep pace at a fast jog, which is quite a good police chase. And I was also

175
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:02,560
 reading about this really cool thing called the marathon de Madoc, which is a French marathon. And

176
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:08,960
 it's known as the world's longest marathon. And it's a full 26 miles and there are 23 wine

177
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:17,840
 stops on the way. And a lot of these. He just paused to complain. Sadly, no, it's where you drink wine.

178
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:25,440
 And they stops also offer specialties such as steak and ice cream when you get to stop. And at 23

179
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:31,040
 miles, there's an oyster stop. So you can have some oysters. And according to the organizers,

180
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:37,600
 this marathon has the most medical support of any marathon in the world. Wow. Of course. Yeah.

181
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,960
 And no one's ever finished it. Come for the steak. Stay for the heart attack.

182
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:52,000
 Slowest animals. The slope is obviously a good guy and can only move three meters per minute.

183
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,560
 But I think that's fine because it can do so much other cool stuff. So it can spin its head 270 degrees,

184
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,440
 which I didn't know. Exorcist style. Quite impressive. Yeah, James is trying it now. You've got about 40,

185
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,320
 I would say 40 degrees. You've managed. Oh, come on. No, you've got about 90.

186
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:11,680
 It certainly went over 90. But I didn't know the slopes were so sudden through the algae grows

187
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:18,000
 on their coat. And they use it as camouflage. Well, they're justifying that after the fact. No,

188
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,200
 this is camouflage. And to do it guys. They eat it as well. Don't they? The algae.

189
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:27,840
 There you go. Multi purpose. This leads to a brilliant, interesting thing about the slowest,

190
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:34,640
 which is the two-toed variety. I think they climb down from the tree to defecate. And that uses up

191
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,480
 eight percent of all their energy, which is a lot of energy just to go to the toilet. Yeah,

192
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:45,600
 it's terrifying that we 12 shits away from death. One uses eight percent of your energy. Oh, yeah.

193
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:51,280
 You will be counting in your head. That's four. That's like you can see like the energy bar at

194
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,080
 like the top of Street Fighter. That's how you can break that down. You'd have to really conserve it,

195
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,240
 wouldn't you? And do they know that? I can hold it for another six hours. But it's been 11.

196
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:09,040
 Okay, time for fact number three. And that is you Chazinski. My effect is that in the 19th

197
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:14,880
 century, you could be committed to an asylum for novel reading. No, it was up your court reading

198
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:20,960
 a novel. Yeah, banged up. Was it specific novels? I didn't say actually, it was just so this is,

199
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:27,040
 well, I found records from West Virginia asylum from between 1864 and 1889. And Pennsylvania State

200
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,440
 Lunar State Hospital are just two sources that I found, which give lists of reasons for admission.

201
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,120
 And one of them is novel reading other reasons for admission into the West Virginia asylum in that

202
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:43,600
 time period include kicked in their head by a horse, bad whiskey and imaginary female trouble.

203
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,960
 Don't know what that is. Yeah, hysteria, I guess. But imaginary. You know, there's a separate one.

204
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,120
 The hysteria is totally separate and menstrual trouble is separate. It could be an imaginary female

205
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:58,800
 trouble with the wife. It was only men. You're not married. Get to be asylum now. Actually,

206
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:04,000
 speaking of that, so in the other asylum, the Pennsylvania asylum novel reading was cited as a cause

207
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:11,040
 of lunacy in two patients. One man was admitted for mortified pride, but the most common cause of

208
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:16,160
 admission, so the most common illness or the most common reason for going mad for which 226

209
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:24,160
 patients were admitted in one year in 1866 was just trouble. Yeah, I got trouble. It's an incredible

210
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:29,760
 list. It includes things like the war. There's another reason for admission to an asylum. Yeah.

211
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:36,720
 Sure, and that's PTSD. That would be must be shell, shell, shell. That would be yeah, two more

212
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:45,680
 of my favorites from that list. One of them is tobacco and masturbation. Are those paired together?

213
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:49,760
 Yes, they are. There's a separate one for masturbation. And then tobacco and masturbation,

214
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:54,320
 I believe is a different question. There's masturbation and syphilis, suppressed masturbation,

215
00:19:54,320 --> 00:20:02,720
 masturbation for 30 years, and my favorite deranged masturbation. That's your favorite one.

216
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:11,040
 Hobby. Yeah, this is like a list of our weekend. It's my to-do list.

217
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:16,560
 Masturbation also thought to be caused by novel reading in the 19th century.

218
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:21,360
 Yep, I was reading an extract from a book called Disease and Sanity and Deformity written in 1860

219
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:26,080
 and it said masturbation often caused by novel reading. And the way you can spot masturbation

220
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,160
 in some, so obviously it's a terrible sin. I know how to spot it.

221
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:37,040
 I don't need a guide. It's hard to identify. Give me a line up. I'll spot the guy.

222
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:44,240
 It's number four. You can tell because he's got tobacco.

223
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:52,560
 Oh, how do you really spot it? You can spot it by some congastly eyes and clammy, greasy skin,

224
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:56,880
 irritability, eyes averted when they meet us, basically all the symptoms of being a teenager.

225
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:03,760
 Oh, I had a good one. Sorry, I have a good thing in the, this was in 1869 and it was an essay by

226
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,880
 the Reverend JT Crane about novel reading about why it's so bad for you. And there was loads of

227
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,760
 different reasons. Mostly it's about encouraging imagination and obviously that's not to be

228
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:19,280
 encouraged. But one of the things says that a novel reader is merged in the hero of the story,

229
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:25,040
 handsome in person, brilliant in mind, endowed with every excellent and excellent and bearing

230
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:30,640
 a name of at least three syllables. So basically if you read novels, it makes you think you have a name

231
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:36,560
 of three syllables. He soon imagines he is desperately in love with some little damsel in the

232
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:42,000
 neighborhood. He begins to canvas her. She turns him down and eventually he commits suicide.

233
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,480
 And that's apparently if you read novels, that's what will happen to you.

234
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:50,320
 To every person who read a novel, really, it is extraordinary, but we don't realize that the novel

235
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:58,240
 was a new form in the, in the 18th and early 19th centuries, but it's extraordinary, but it's

236
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,280
 extraordinary to think of a world in which novels were unknown and then suddenly people were writing

237
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,520
 these, no, they were, yeah, and it was a lot of worried of course typical to the time about the

238
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,560
 effect on young women. Oh, it was all about women. How they would imagine themselves to be, as you say,

239
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:17,040
 James, heroines and things like that. Yeah, yeah. That would lead them to abandon their studies. The

240
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:21,680
 wholesome pursuits actually, Jane Austen mounts a very lively defense of novel reading in North

241
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:26,320
 Anger Abbey. She says they contain everything that's excellent in mankind. Yeah, she didn't have

242
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:31,280
 a vested interest. That's being a novel writer. Oh, you've blown the lid right on this one, James,

243
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:37,920
 going in private eye now. Not just women, because what about Gertr's sorrows of your

244
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:44,560
 verta? I like that it's Gertr's sorrows of verta. Yeah, I do like that. No, but that was the novel he

245
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:49,760
 wrote, wasn't it? Yeah, it was the character. The main character commits suicide. One of the characters

246
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,440
 was very distinctively dressed. I can't really remember it. It was like he had yellow trousers or

247
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,680
 and a red jacket or something that I commit suicide and then everyone supposedly copied him.

248
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:03,760
 And there was two thousand suicides in Europe blamed on that novel. God, wow. So they are dangerous.

249
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,400
 Yeah. Stay away from the novels. Okay, we've got to move on. Anyone got anything else so we're

250
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,440
 chucking? Yeah, just some really good stuff about how they dealt with the mentally ill in the 19th

251
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,160
 century. So when you were put into your asylum for novel reading, some things that you could have

252
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,680
 done to you were so freezing cold showers and shaved heads were often administered because it

253
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:25,520
 was thought that you could release the madness through your head and you'd have an application of

254
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:30,000
 blisters where your skin was burnt a lot. So you blistered up. So a blister would be prescribed.

255
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,240
 But the funnest, I think, a whirling chairs. So these were what they sound like, really,

256
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,920
 where you get sat in a chair tied to it and it spins around and around and around and it's

257
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:44,320
 supposed to send your madness propelling from your body. So there's a great account, for instance,

258
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:49,520
 in 1822. Did it work? Yeah, it worked like a charm, like a dream. In all the accounts I've read,

259
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,760
 I've read tons. It's always no improvement, no improvement. They never caught on. If there was a

260
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:59,600
 transcript of just like the doctor's kitchen where they all met during the day, they would sound

261
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,800
 way more mad than anyone who was in that side. How's as your day been? I put him on the whirling

262
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:10,000
 charity, you know, propel his madness out of it. How did it go? It didn't work. I don't know if we've

263
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,040
 got a faulty chair. I don't know what's going on. Does the conversations would have been insane in

264
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:23,280
 that? You did a whirling fast enough. Okay, time for our final fact and that is Andy.

265
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:29,440
 Hello, my fact is that the Japanese Yakuza crime syndicate has its own website, which has a theme

266
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,240
 tune designed to attract new members. Wait, so just very quickly because I know much about them.

267
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:41,280
 This is like a real kind of like menacing mafia like, yeah, except that there's a lot of acceptance

268
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:48,000
 of them in Japanese society and it's not illegal to be a member, but it is illegal to do obviously a

269
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,760
 lot of the activities, which is extortion or or rackets of one kind or another. So they have a very

270
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,080
 interesting racket, which is basically large scale bribery where they buy shares in a company

271
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,240
 enough to get them to a shareholder's meeting where they can speak in public. And then they just find

272
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,600
 dirt on the company's executives, get in touch with them and say, if you don't pay us a significant

273
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,600
 whack of money, we will come to the shareholder's meeting and read out all this terrible stuff about

274
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:17,440
 you. And so they do it. And the only effective method against them apparently is to have everyone's

275
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:24,880
 shareholder meetings on the same day so that they can't be everywhere at once. So now 90% of

276
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,400
 companies on the Tokyo Stock Exchange have their annual shareholder meetings on the same day now.

277
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:35,280
 Yeah. Yeah. But it's very weirdly half accepted and then they see themselves as not being

278
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:40,160
 criminals. They see themselves as having a proper coat of honor and having, you know, like night and

279
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:45,360
 they sometimes do, I mean, whether it's a cynical act or not, they, for instance, in 2011,

280
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:51,840
 were some of the first people to get to the tsunami. The tsunami affected areas with aid, weren't they?

281
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:57,760
 And in 1995, the same thing in Kobe in when the earthquake hit, they think that if the U.K.s hadn't

282
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:02,160
 arrived in time with their aid, then there would have been much, much more damage done because

283
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:06,960
 other agencies couldn't get in fast enough. Yeah. So they're controversial because they don't,

284
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:13,760
 they're not totally unpopular. They've got this thing. I read that they have a 12-page exam now

285
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,000
 for all of our members. Yeah. Just to make sure because they keep getting in trouble for kind of

286
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,720
 rookie errors and the way that laws are changing and so on. I think it's because they don't mind doing

287
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,120
 their big racketeering and stuff, but they don't want to get in with a brawl or just like

288
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,760
 a lane, like a parking fine or something like that. They're trying to stop them doing the small things.

289
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,320
 But that's what's really funny because in a normal exam, if you were doing that for normal people

290
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,960
 who just live quite a sort of legal life, it would be stuff like not parking your car in a certain spot.

291
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:48,720
 The stuff that they have, the topics that they cover are dumping industrial waste and vehicle theft,

292
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:54,080
 which is normal. I love that dumping industrial waste. They also have a newsletter that they do.

293
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,920
 Yeah. And it's, what do you want to know? No, no, you go for it.

294
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:03,040
 So it goes only to the regular members. You have to be a proper full-time member to get one

295
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:09,840
 of the newsletters, but that's 28,000 people. And it's articles, motivational articles from the

296
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,120
 management about the difficult times we're going through it and I'm going to pick up soon.

297
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:20,640
 Haikus articles on fishing, in treaties to perform good works. So I think it's designed

298
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,440
 partly as a little propaganda thing because they know that people outside, or also going to read it.

299
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,040
 Hey, these guys, they sound like pretty fun. We should go angling sometime with them.

300
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:33,680
 Did you go on to their website that you were talking about? Yeah, I did. And it's very old school.

301
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:39,360
 You can translate it into English, can't you? And a lot of it is about anti-Marijuana saying that

302
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,720
 marijuana shouldn't be allowed in the country and all that kind of stuff. Yeah, exactly.

303
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:48,640
 The banished drugs and purified the nation league is the front for it.

304
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,040
 Yeah, um, isn't there a branch with that's that is quite anti-drug zone? I got it's called the

305
00:27:53,040 --> 00:28:00,640
 Yamaguchi Gumi. Yeah, the Yamaguchi Gumi is genuinely quite anti-drugs or parts of it are very

306
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:06,880
 anti-drugs. Yes, yes, they are. So they're selective about the crimes they commit. They are exactly.

307
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:12,560
 It's more a kind of power extortion racketeering thing. I should say where I got this fact from.

308
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:16,400
 It's from this magazine called delayed gratification quarterly, which is a very cool magazine because

309
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:20,800
 it's all news from three months ago, which has been filtered and written about really carefully.

310
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:25,120
 And there's this incredible photo feature which you should check out by a guy called Anton Kuster's

311
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,760
 who was allowed into the syndicate for two years to photograph them. Their tattoos are

312
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,240
 extraordinary. They often don't get a say. Oh, well, put these up on the side. Yeah,

313
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:40,320
 yeah, there's a few Google Anton Kuster's. It's a K-U-S-T-E-R-S, then you'll find his photos often.

314
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,800
 Right. This magazine just sounds like an excuse for a newspaper that was very slow getting to

315
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:51,120
 the press. It sounds like if Greenland Sharks made a newspaper. I did genuinely try to get hold

316
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:56,160
 of delayed gratification quarterly on Monday last week and they said, come back on Wednesday.

317
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:03,760
 Hell's Angels, another, well, the US Department of Justice,

318
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:09,360
 Consentism, a crime syndicate. And anyway, I was reading a news story on the other day where a

319
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:14,080
 German student moond a group of Hell's Angels and hold a puppy at them before escaping on a stolen

320
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,640
 bulldozer. So he ran outside, presumably, where every single one of their Harley-Davidson's

321
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:24,080
 was sitting, thought, I need an escape vehicle. Need to get away from these guys real quick.

322
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:29,360
 Bulldozer. He must have thought that the dog would distract them somehow. Well, it must have,

323
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,720
 because he was stopped by the police, not the Hell's Angels. Perhaps they thought they didn't

324
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,480
 really care that much. They'd rather go on drinking. Did they have a theme tune as well? Oh,

325
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,040
 speaking the theme tunes. Have we got, did you manage to find the Yakuza? Yeah. So here it is.

326
00:29:41,040 --> 00:30:01,680
 So there's nothing but my courage in this body. I'll trust myself to the life of the Yakuza and

327
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:06,480
 follow this path I've decided on. Wow. It's not as jingly as I was hoping it would be.

328
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,440
 No, it's not really. I was hoping it was more like an advert trying to get you to a KFC or a McDonald's

329
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,000
 or something like that. Yeah, I'm not signing up after hearing that. It should be like don't be a loser

330
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:22,640
 join the Yakuza. Change has been the whole podcast planning that. So speaking of theme tunes,

331
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:28,160
 did you guys know that Salmon Rushdie wrote a theme tune once? No. For a TV show we all know and

332
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:34,320
 love. Nope. He wrote a theme tune. It was titled The Best Things Begin With Bee and it was for

333
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:39,200
 the Burnley Building Society. He wrote the lyrics to it. You can dream a little, you can dream a lot,

334
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,640
 but the best dreams of all are the ones you've got building in the Burnley. That is fun. And I can't

335
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,480
 find any evidence of online. I reckon he goes through the internet every day and make sure he

336
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,560
 deletes every reference to it. That's great though. I didn't even know Burnley had a building

337
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:57,920
 society. He didn't do its job. Apparently he was a very bad advertising. The one thing I know about

338
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:03,040
 Burnley is they drink more Benedictine than anywhere else in the world. Do they? Well, the best

339
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:09,440
 things in life do begin with B. Benny Hottens working. They drink it in Benny and Hottens, which is

340
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,160
 Benedictine and Hotwater and it's a specific club especially in a certain area of Burnley and they

341
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:20,480
 all drink Benedictine. Really? And then invest their money very sensibly. Yes. That's what they're into.

342
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:26,400
 There was something else. Oh yeah. He worked, he came up with a slogan for fresh cream cakes,

343
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:32,560
 naughty but nice. Yes, he did. And he also invented the word irresistible. Yep.

344
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:38,080
 For arrow chocolate bars. Pretty cool. So that obviously prefigured a lot of his magical realism

345
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:43,840
 later on. Can I tell you something about theme tunes? Yes, please. Yes. Okay, I have a couple of

346
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,840
 things about theme tunes which I really like. So you know the theme tune to Desert Island Discs?

347
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:57,600
 Yes. Very nice. It was inspired by the view of a bogna region. Yeah. He composed a rotate

348
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,080
 looking across the lagoon towards Bogna. It's called the blue lagoon or something, isn't it?

349
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,760
 Yeah, it is sleepy lagoon. Sleepy lagoon? Yeah. I kind of makes you want to go there.

350
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,400
 Good old bogna region, so it gets really bad rap, doesn't it? It does. Yeah. I shouldn't, as you say.

351
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:15,040
 It's like water just a quick interjection. Waterloo sunset was originally called Liverpool sunset,

352
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:20,080
 wasn't it? Because it was about the beauty of a sunset of Liverpool. And then it was changed because

353
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:25,280
 I think the kinks felt that Waterloo might resonate with more people. Burnley sunset would have been

354
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,720
 better, wouldn't it? Burnley sunset. Yeah. The best things in life begin with B.

355
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:34,080
 Yeah. Simon Rushdie is working on his sequel now. I'm Burnley building's a side sunset.

356
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:42,160
 Did you know that the Star Wars theme tune has lyrics? Well, I know. Yeah. What are the lyrics?

357
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:46,720
 So, okay, basically, there was a holiday special that was made that George Lucas has since said

358
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,960
 if he had enough time and a hammer, he would go around smashing every pirated copy out there

359
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:56,080
 that still exists. And it was basically the story of Chewbacca going home for Chewbacca

360
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:01,440
 a wookie day with his family. During it had all these very surreal moments and all the actors from

361
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:07,840
 Star Wars were in it, including Princess Leia, who then sings the Star Wars theme tune with lyrics.

362
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:12,800
 Yeah. And the lyrics are roughly, we celebrate a day of peace, a day of harmony, a day of joy,

363
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,800
 we can all share together joy. It's a really boring lyrics, but it's a really nice, it's a really

364
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:24,080
 nice thing to the lyrics are out there for that song. There was, and I don't know if it's right to

365
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:29,920
 call this a theme tune, but early American presidential candidates, they would have songs associated

366
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:36,160
 with, oh yeah, I kind of are like theme tunes. So, John Quincy Adams was the president in 1828 and

367
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:44,080
 he was the incumbent and he was facing Andrew Jackson. So, John Quincy Adams, he didn't write it,

368
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:51,520
 but a song penned on his behalf was called Little Little No Yee Who's Coming. And it warns of

369
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:57,920
 fire and slavery and pestilence if John Quincy Adams loses the election. Lyrics are, fires are coming,

370
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:02,720
 swords are coming, pistols, guns and knives are coming, if John Quincy not be coming.

371
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:10,480
 And then he lost the election by a landslide. And did Wars America overtaken for the next 100

372
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:15,680
 years by fire and brimstone? It was not. You were just talking about presidential theme tunes,

373
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:19,680
 I really like the fact that was it Bill Clinton's one of the democratic conventions when Bill Clinton

374
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:24,320
 was incumbent. It was originally going to be the theme tune for the convention was going to be

375
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:29,280
 a manbo number five until the song. A smart person pointed out that it contains that they're

376
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:35,920
 a little bit of moniker in my life. So, they changed that. I think Bill Clinton used to go up to

377
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:42,720
 ladies and go, the best things in life begin with a B. That's very funny. Have we got any more on

378
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:47,280
 this? So, there was a gang of counterfeiters that tried to con the Bank of England a few years

379
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:54,080
 ago out of £28 billion. And they did that by claiming to have a collection of £1,000 and £5,000

380
00:34:54,080 --> 00:35:00,800
 banknotes. According to the news article, the audacious plot was foiled by the fact that the £1,000 banknotes

381
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:06,640
 had not been legal tender for more than 60 years and the £500,000 version never existed.

382
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:11,280
 My Roman coin scam is going to go really bad.

383
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:18,560
 Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts. Thank you so much everyone for listening. If you want to get

384
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:24,000
 in contact with any of us about the stuff we've been talking about, you can head to @QIPodcast on Twitter

385
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,880
 as a main stop. But if you want to get to us individually, I can be got an @Sriberland James.

386
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:37,920
 Take shapes. Andy @UndrewHunterM. And Anna, you can email me on podcast@QI.com. Why are you chocolate?

387
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,200
 I don't know. You always, when you say it, the fact that you're not on Twitter and then you say

388
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,880
 an email, it sounds as far away as like, say, a fax number. Telegram?

389
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:53,040
 Yeah, you can, yeah. Okay, that's it. You can also head to our website. No such thing as a fish.com

390
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:57,760
 where we've got all the previous episodes of these series that we've made so far. It's about 27

391
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:08,240
 episodes. Otherwise, we'll see you again next week for another episode and catch you then. Good bye.
