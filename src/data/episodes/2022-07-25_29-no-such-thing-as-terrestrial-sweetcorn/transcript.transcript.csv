00:00:00,00:00:04,We run it on QI a few years ago. Yeah. Which was there's no such thing as a fish.
00:00:04,00:00:09,"It's a nice such thing as a fish. No, seriously. It's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life."
00:00:09,00:00:12,It says it right there. First paragraph. No such thing as a fish.
00:00:12,00:00:23,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:00:23,00:00:27,from the QI offices in Covern Garden. My name is Dan Shriver. I'm sitting here with three
00:00:27,00:00:32,"of the regular elves. It is James Harkin, Anne Chazinski and Andy Murray. And once again,"
00:00:32,00:00:37,we've got our four favorite facts from the last seven days and here they are in no particular order.
00:00:37,00:00:43,"James, starting with you. What's your fact? Okay, my fact this week is that the head of the"
00:00:43,00:00:47,International Chess Federation believes that chess was brought to earth by aliens.
00:00:47,00:00:53,And he should know. Yeah. What kind of evidence does he have for that?
00:00:54,00:01:00,He has first hand evidence because he was abducted by aliens in 1997 and shown around the galaxy.
00:01:00,00:01:08,"And they told him the earth is set to collide with the planet Nibiru, killing us all if mankind does"
00:01:08,00:01:14,not cleanse its aura by playing more chess. That was it. In an interview in Time Magazine. That was.
00:01:14,00:01:21,What's his name again? Mr. Ilyum Jinoff. He's a politician as well. He's the head of the
00:01:21,00:01:27,Kalminkir province of Russia and he has friends such as Chuck Norris and he was friends with
00:01:27,00:01:33,Salam Hussein. He's friends with David Ike. Why do these political guys? All these sort of like
00:01:33,00:01:40,eccentric characters always have an American action hero as a good mate. They all have Chuck Norris
00:01:40,00:01:46,being his mate or like Kim Jong Un having Dennis Rodney. Yeah. I guess it's like a trophy friend.
00:01:46,00:01:52,Trophy American mate for some kind of buddy movie that may erupt one. Any biography movie done
00:01:52,00:01:56,of a big political leader of our time is effectively going to come out like rush hour.
00:01:56,00:02:04,"Chuck Norris just quickly on him. I read this thing whereby he despite being in violent movies,"
00:02:04,00:02:08,hates that his kids would have to watch violent movies but they all want to watch his movies.
00:02:08,00:02:13,So he does this thing where he edits out all the fight scenes from his movies and lets his kids
00:02:13,00:02:19,watch that and I cannot think of anything more painful than watching a Chuck Norris movie without the
00:02:19,00:02:24,fighting scenes. Yeah. Do they think that he's in a load of 26-minute-long feature films?
00:02:24,00:02:32,"Just back to this guy, Mr. Ilyum Jinoff, he said that aliens gave us chess. That's one thing but he"
00:02:32,00:02:37,also said they gave us something else. Anyone know what it is? No. What is it? A technology
00:02:37,00:02:43,or an illness or a body part? No. Sweetcorn. He says they gave a sweetcorn but he says it was a
00:02:43,00:02:48,different civilization that gave us sweetcorn. Maybe the Aztecs are the Incans or something.
00:02:48,00:02:52,And are they threatening the world with destruction unless we eat as much sweetcorn as he is
00:02:52,00:02:58,only possible? Do you know what? He's been more asked about the chess donation from space
00:02:58,00:03:01,than he knows the sweetcorn. I can't find anything else out there. You know what guys? I was really
00:03:01,00:03:07,"hoping this was going to be about chess. Can I tell you the fact about chess? Yes, please."
00:03:07,00:03:14,"Okay. In 1999 Gary Kasperov, obviously great chess champion, played the world at chess. Oh yeah."
00:03:14,00:03:19,"He played 50,000 different people from more than 75 countries in one game. So they also"
00:03:19,00:03:24,met a vote on what move they should take as a team and whichever move received most votes was the
00:03:24,00:03:30,"move that the world made against Gary Kasperov. After four months the game ended at move 62,"
00:03:30,00:03:39,when 51% of the world's team voted to resign. 49% must have been levied. Yeah. But they weren't even
00:03:39,00:03:44,"acting on that. So 50,000 people, but they weren't even on their own even as 50,000. They had four"
00:03:44,00:03:49,"chess experts guiding them, acting as world team coaches and suggesting moves and strategies."
00:03:49,00:03:57,"So even with expert help, 50,000 people cannot be Gary Kasperov. Gary Kasperov, so famously he"
00:03:57,00:04:02,"obviously had the two matches against deep blue, the Supercomputer, the latter of which was in 9,"
00:04:02,00:04:07,"so he won the first one, which was a set of six games. And then in 1997 he played another set of six"
00:04:07,00:04:14,"games. And in the first game of the six he won, but he basically had a mental breakdown after"
00:04:14,00:04:19,the finish because the computer had done what he thought was a completely ingenious move that even he
00:04:19,00:04:25,"couldn't understand. So Gary Kasperov was winning, but the computer moved a rook in a really random"
00:04:25,00:04:29,position. And Gary Kasperov couldn't work out why that possibly would make any computing sense.
00:04:29,00:04:33,"So suddenly he went, ""Oh my god, I can't work out the logic of what this computer is doing. It"
00:04:33,00:04:38,"must be better than me."" And that was the last game that he ever won against the computer because"
00:04:38,00:04:45,he became so frightened that this has superhuman intelligence. And actually one of the computer engineers
00:04:45,00:04:51,admitted to Nate Silver 15 years later that there was a bug in the computer and it just resulted
00:04:51,00:04:55,"to randomly moving a piece, totally at random. It would have been better if someone had just moved"
00:04:55,00:05:01,"the horse in the wrong way. He's like, ""Yes, that would have been a horror baby."" Just knocked the"
00:05:01,00:05:06,"table over. ""Oh my god, you can move a horse three up and five across."" ""I have no one tell me this."""
00:05:06,00:05:10,He thought it was a sign that there were humans intervening with the computer.
00:05:10,00:05:15,"Oh yeah, and he thought they were very interesting. Just about your thing about Kasperov versus the"
00:05:15,00:05:23,"world and there's, ""I can go one better on that,"" which is the first ever world chess champion"
00:05:23,00:05:30,was called Bill Helm Steinitz and he was a great player and he beat everyone and then he started to
00:05:30,00:05:37,slightly lose his marbles a little bit and he challenged God to a match and he would play God quite
00:05:37,00:05:43,often and he quite often beat God and he got so much better than God that he would start giving God
00:05:43,00:05:49,"like a pawn extra to try and make it a bit more even. When you say he beat God? Yeah, it was God playing."
00:05:49,00:05:54,"Well, I think he was slightly schizophrenic so he was getting the moves himself and go,"
00:05:54,00:06:01,"""Oh, God did that. Oh, God, you idiot!"" And so he would be God and very sadly, he ended up in a"
00:06:01,00:06:07,mental asylum and died penniless. He was the first ever chess champion called Bill Helm Steinitz.
00:06:07,00:06:10,There is a debate about where the chess makes you mad or not. There's a really good
00:06:10,00:06:15,Nabokov quote about the fact that everyone who plays chess must eventually go insane. But my
00:06:15,00:06:20,"favorite chess player is this guy called Nathan Shoransky who is now an Israeli politician, I think,"
00:06:20,00:06:26,but he was a human rights campaigner in Soviet Russia and he was a childhood chess prodigy
00:06:26,00:06:32,and he was put in a Siberian prison in 1977 for nine years and he said chess kept him sane. So he
00:06:32,00:06:38,"was in this tiny freezing-cold cell, slightly given any food. It was completely dark. There was"
00:06:38,00:06:42,absolutely nothing in the cell just stone and he just played chess in his head against himself
00:06:42,00:06:45,for nine years and said that that was the only way that he survived it.
00:06:45,00:06:50,"Well, that kept him sane. Yeah. I think it's in a round. They banned the, you know, when you get"
00:06:50,00:06:54,the pawn to the end and you can turn it into a queen. Yeah. I think they banned that move because
00:06:54,00:06:59,it promoted bigamy because then the king had two wives. Surely it would be promoting transvestism.
00:06:59,00:07:06,"Are you assuming that pawns are men? Yes, I am. Are they? I don't know. I'm comfortable with that."
00:07:06,00:07:11,Queens used to only be able to move less like they could only move one space like in any direction.
00:07:11,00:07:14,"Yeah, they were rubbish. They were the worst. And then they could move like knights for a while"
00:07:14,00:07:17,"for some reason, which is kind of bizarre because you would have thought knights could move like that"
00:07:17,00:07:22,"because their horses. Queen could do it too. Sorry. Just the logic is like, well, they're on horses,"
00:07:22,00:07:25,"so that makes sense. She has never struck me that doesn't make sense, doesn't it? The knight's"
00:07:25,00:07:29,"can move too. The horses can jump over. I think they can jump over a base. Yeah, they can jump,"
00:07:29,00:07:34,but there's no particular reason why a horse could would move too forward and one to the side.
00:07:34,00:07:38,"At the same time, the evil carnivals of the chess world. Do you guys, when you play Monopoly,"
00:07:38,00:07:41,"are you going, okay, I'm going to get the car because that moves faster than a hat."
00:07:41,00:07:46,"This is a bit too much logic. Oh, I get a battleship. Blow up the iron. Yeah,"
00:07:46,00:07:51,"when you see them, they brought out new pieces for the Monopoly board. Yeah, they brought in a cat"
00:07:51,00:07:55,"last year, didn't they? Yeah, they've got rid of the iron or the old boot, possibly, and replaced it"
00:07:55,00:08:02,"with a cat. But is it? Sorry, go on, Andy. Sorry, just on the Monopoly thing, the cat won a vote,"
00:08:02,00:08:08,"a popular online vote, and it beat a robot helicopter diamond ring and a guitar. And one of the guys"
00:08:08,00:08:13,"from Hasbro said, I think there were a lot of cat lovers in the world that reached out. They're always"
00:08:13,00:08:19,"bloody reaching out. Robot should have won. King Canute, who we all know, turned back the waves."
00:08:19,00:08:26,"He once had a chess game with an Earl of his called Earl Ulf, and he did a move. I think it was a"
00:08:26,00:08:32,"nice move, but he realized it was a bad one. Try to take it back. Earl Ulf said, no, you can't do that."
00:08:32,00:08:38,"It turned into a massive argument. Can you tip up the table, went off in a half, and then had Earl"
00:08:38,00:08:44,"Ulf killed? Wow. Napoleon got really angry playing chess. Well, according to one account, Napoleon"
00:08:44,00:08:49,"got really angry playing chess against the mechanical Turk, didn't he? Yeah, we should explain who the"
00:08:49,00:08:54,"mechanical Turk was. Yeah, so the mechanical Turk was a fake chess machine that existed between"
00:08:54,00:09:02,"1770 and 1854, and it was theoretically, it was this robot that was dressed up like a Turk,"
00:09:02,00:09:07,"and it managed to beat Napoleon, Franklin, Babbage, other famous people at chess, and it sort of"
00:09:07,00:09:12,"toured the globe, and it was this Turkish man with a huge box on which he had a chess board,"
00:09:12,00:09:17,"that he apparently played by some robotic power. So I don't know why no one ever said, hey,"
00:09:17,00:09:21,can this Turk play without the huge box? Because inside the huge box under the chess board was
00:09:21,00:09:26,obviously a guy who was controlling the chess pieces. Why does our box keep sneezing? Yeah.
00:09:26,00:09:34,What? Maybe this is why the robot's not allowed on the monopoly boy. All games have been banned from.
00:09:34,00:09:41,"Gays Napoleon puts into death. But yeah, at one point in Napoleon, I think, wrapped a shawl around"
00:09:41,00:09:46,"the mechanical Turk's head so that he wouldn't be able to see the board, which obviously didn't make"
00:09:46,00:09:54,"a blind bit of difference. There was another famous chess player who always had excuses, and he'd lost"
00:09:54,00:09:58,"five games in a row. He was five nil down, and he said, oh, the first one I lost because I had two"
00:09:58,00:10:02,"thugs, and the second one I lost because I had a headache, and the third one I lost because I had"
00:10:02,00:10:07,"rheumatism in my legs, and the fourth one I lost because it just wasn't feeling very well,"
00:10:07,00:10:12,"and then they said, oh, why did you lose the fifth one? And he said, what, am I expected to win every game?"
00:10:15,00:10:23,"That was like when David Hay, after his match where he lost his eye arch, you know, I twisted my ankle"
00:10:23,00:10:29,"this morning, and that was his excuse. No, he broke a toe. He broke a toe. I broke my toe,"
00:10:29,00:10:35,"and I really affected how I punched with my arms. I just wish I'd learn. Oh, yeah, come on,"
00:10:35,00:10:40,"that's all right. Yeah. What, you toe? Yeah, you can't move. Can be really painful. No, he was,"
00:10:40,00:10:45,"he was fine. Can I just say if David Hayes listening, I believe you. Oh, me too, actually."
00:10:45,00:10:50,"Yeah. Sorry, David. I don't, but I don't know who you are. I thought you were a chess player."
00:10:50,00:11:00,"Come on, let's bring weedy chess player Hay over here. This is rash. I broke his other toe."
00:11:00,00:11:09,"Okay, time for fact number two, and that is my fact. My fact this week concerns the Greenland shark,"
00:11:09,00:11:13,which is a shark I didn't know existed until a few days ago. What I love about it is the Greenland
00:11:13,00:11:20,"shark is so slow that it basically needs all of his food to be asleep in order to eat it,"
00:11:20,00:11:25,"because otherwise if it can move, anything can out swim it because its fastest speed is one mile per"
00:11:25,00:11:31,"hour. Why is this slow? Because it's in cold water, and so it needs to preserve all of its energy,"
00:11:31,00:11:35,"and so on. They can do a little burst of speed. Are they the sharks? They can, but when they say,"
00:11:35,00:11:39,"when they, in everything I've read, I could be, if someone out there knows any different, because"
00:11:39,00:11:45,"I'd love to know, apparently with the bursts of speed, they can only get up to about 1.6 miles"
00:11:45,00:11:50,"and that's their burst of speed. That's amazing. Yeah, it's not as much a burst, is it? They're"
00:11:50,00:11:54,"amazing looking. They're 20 feet long as well. They're huge. Yeah, they're ginormous. Yeah."
00:11:54,00:12:00,"So it eats seals, the Greenland shark, and the problem with eating seals is that it's fine if they"
00:12:00,00:12:05,"can manage to get the seal, but the seal can swim at two miles per hour. So it's always just in front"
00:12:05,00:12:10,of this shark who's given it its all gone gone. It's not always just in front. It's always increasing
00:12:10,00:12:14,its distance. That's true. That's true. That's right. A mile every hour. So basically they have to wait
00:12:14,00:12:20,"to find a sleeping seal, and here's the thing. The seals are their main predator or the polar bearers"
00:12:20,00:12:26,"up on the ice, and they would rather be in the ocean and risk being asleep, because they can probably"
00:12:26,00:12:30,"have a good sleep. Notice a shark on its way, and by the time it wakes up, it can still get away. Yeah,"
00:12:30,00:12:36,"you could press snooze quite a few times before it gets you could. But their extraordinary creatures,"
00:12:36,00:12:40,"just generally, their skin is poisonous. I don't know if I've read about that within any other"
00:12:40,00:12:44,"sharks. Not the rest of them too, the flesh as well. That's sorry. Yeah, yeah, so they're completely"
00:12:44,00:12:49,poisonous. We couldn't eat them. And do you know what it does to you if you eat it? Do you know
00:12:49,00:12:54,"the effects it has? What's the poison? The poison. So the poison is try methylene oxide, and so if"
00:12:54,00:12:58,"you eat the flesh of the shark, that has the effect of extreme drunkenness. Does it? So if you"
00:12:58,00:13:03,"manage to not eat too much, then you can just get really pissed. Oh, so it's like licking a toad,"
00:13:03,00:13:07,"except if you don't like drugs and you like alcohol. Yeah, exactly. Wow, like a hallucinogenic toad."
00:13:07,00:13:13,"You can lick this shark. Looking, I think you'd have a nibble. You can't cook it, though. There are"
00:13:13,00:13:19,"ways of preparing it properly, but it's a very disgusting way of cooking it. You have to bury the meat"
00:13:19,00:13:24,"in the ground for it's one of these, is it? Yeah, for six to twelve weeks, and then you expose it"
00:13:24,00:13:28,"every so often, and you thaw it out, and then you freeze it again. Then you have to hang it up to"
00:13:28,00:13:32,"try it for several months, and then you finally cut it into bite-sized cubes. Well, I think in order to"
00:13:32,00:13:37,"eat that, you'd have to be pretty drunk. Yeah, and it says the end product, which is called"
00:13:37,00:13:43,"a heckarl, or a heckarl, is a delicacy, which is the universal way of describing foods that are"
00:13:43,00:13:50,"horrible, but rare. They can live, these sharks can live up to 200 years, they think. No, that can't"
00:13:50,00:13:55,"be right. Yeah, this is what they say. They know this because scientists have said that they can"
00:13:55,00:14:00,"live up to roughly 200 years of age. They know this because they measure how much they grow per year,"
00:14:00,00:14:05,"and they only grow about one, between half and one centimeter per year, and so they found them the"
00:14:05,00:14:10,"size of great white sharks, and they made an assumption that that's how large they can get. It's really"
00:14:10,00:14:15,"weird how little we know about this shark as well. They were only first photographed in 1995, and the"
00:14:15,00:14:20,"first bit of actual footage of them is from 2003. So they're kind of this new species to us, really."
00:14:20,00:14:27,"It was actually thought that sharks, in general, died in their 20s, but then they did radioactive tests"
00:14:27,00:14:32,on them because the radiation that went from the nuclear test into the environment meant that you
00:14:32,00:14:37,"can test how old things are, and they found that sharks now routinely live into their 70s. At"
00:14:37,00:14:42,"least. Wow. Wow. Okay. Yeah. That's such a strange thought, isn't it, elderly shark? They have found"
00:14:42,00:14:46,"inside the Greenland shark, haven't they? Some pretty impressive animals given that they move so"
00:14:46,00:14:51,"slowly. They think that they've got, they found reindeer and they found really fast moving seals inside"
00:14:51,00:14:57,"it. A lion, a cheetah. A polar bear. A polar bear. A polar bear. It's found inside one of them. Yeah,"
00:14:57,00:15:04,"they, which is weird. They basically eat everything because they don't have many options of living things"
00:15:04,00:15:08,"to eat because everything can swim away. They're genuinely, they're scavengers. They just, if they see"
00:15:08,00:15:13,"something dead and it looks edible, they will eat it because that's, their, their three options are,"
00:15:13,00:15:19,"it's either asleep, it's dead or it's swam into my face. Those are the three eating options that they have."
00:15:19,00:15:27,"I want to talk about some slow chases. Okay. Yeah. So in, I don't know when this was. A few years ago,"
00:15:27,00:15:36,there was a news report of a guy called Mr. Smith who stole a JCB and then he drove off at 10 to
00:15:36,00:15:42,"15 miles an hour. The police were called. They started chasing him, but then realized that he was"
00:15:42,00:15:47,"just going and they couldn't stop him. And so the, the policeman got out and chased him on foot."
00:15:47,00:15:57,"And he said, I was able to keep pace at a fast jog, which is quite a good police chase. And I was also"
00:15:57,00:16:02,"reading about this really cool thing called the marathon de Madoc, which is a French marathon. And"
00:16:02,00:16:08,it's known as the world's longest marathon. And it's a full 26 miles and there are 23 wine
00:16:08,00:16:17,"stops on the way. And a lot of these. He just paused to complain. Sadly, no, it's where you drink wine."
00:16:17,00:16:25,And they stops also offer specialties such as steak and ice cream when you get to stop. And at 23
00:16:25,00:16:31,"miles, there's an oyster stop. So you can have some oysters. And according to the organizers,"
00:16:31,00:16:37,this marathon has the most medical support of any marathon in the world. Wow. Of course. Yeah.
00:16:37,00:16:40,And no one's ever finished it. Come for the steak. Stay for the heart attack.
00:16:40,00:16:52,Slowest animals. The slope is obviously a good guy and can only move three meters per minute.
00:16:52,00:16:56,"But I think that's fine because it can do so much other cool stuff. So it can spin its head 270 degrees,"
00:16:56,00:17:01,"which I didn't know. Exorcist style. Quite impressive. Yeah, James is trying it now. You've got about 40,"
00:17:01,00:17:06,"I would say 40 degrees. You've managed. Oh, come on. No, you've got about 90."
00:17:06,00:17:11,It certainly went over 90. But I didn't know the slopes were so sudden through the algae grows
00:17:11,00:17:18,"on their coat. And they use it as camouflage. Well, they're justifying that after the fact. No,"
00:17:18,00:17:23,this is camouflage. And to do it guys. They eat it as well. Don't they? The algae.
00:17:23,00:17:27,"There you go. Multi purpose. This leads to a brilliant, interesting thing about the slowest,"
00:17:27,00:17:34,which is the two-toed variety. I think they climb down from the tree to defecate. And that uses up
00:17:34,00:17:38,"eight percent of all their energy, which is a lot of energy just to go to the toilet. Yeah,"
00:17:38,00:17:45,"it's terrifying that we 12 shits away from death. One uses eight percent of your energy. Oh, yeah."
00:17:45,00:17:51,You will be counting in your head. That's four. That's like you can see like the energy bar at
00:17:51,00:17:56,"like the top of Street Fighter. That's how you can break that down. You'd have to really conserve it,"
00:17:56,00:18:00,wouldn't you? And do they know that? I can hold it for another six hours. But it's been 11.
00:18:02,00:18:09,"Okay, time for fact number three. And that is you Chazinski. My effect is that in the 19th"
00:18:09,00:18:14,"century, you could be committed to an asylum for novel reading. No, it was up your court reading"
00:18:14,00:18:20,"a novel. Yeah, banged up. Was it specific novels? I didn't say actually, it was just so this is,"
00:18:20,00:18:27,"well, I found records from West Virginia asylum from between 1864 and 1889. And Pennsylvania State"
00:18:27,00:18:31,"Lunar State Hospital are just two sources that I found, which give lists of reasons for admission."
00:18:32,00:18:37,And one of them is novel reading other reasons for admission into the West Virginia asylum in that
00:18:37,00:18:43,"time period include kicked in their head by a horse, bad whiskey and imaginary female trouble."
00:18:43,00:18:48,"Don't know what that is. Yeah, hysteria, I guess. But imaginary. You know, there's a separate one."
00:18:48,00:18:53,The hysteria is totally separate and menstrual trouble is separate. It could be an imaginary female
00:18:53,00:18:58,"trouble with the wife. It was only men. You're not married. Get to be asylum now. Actually,"
00:18:58,00:19:04,"speaking of that, so in the other asylum, the Pennsylvania asylum novel reading was cited as a cause"
00:19:04,00:19:11,"of lunacy in two patients. One man was admitted for mortified pride, but the most common cause of"
00:19:11,00:19:16,"admission, so the most common illness or the most common reason for going mad for which 226"
00:19:16,00:19:24,"patients were admitted in one year in 1866 was just trouble. Yeah, I got trouble. It's an incredible"
00:19:24,00:19:29,list. It includes things like the war. There's another reason for admission to an asylum. Yeah.
00:19:29,00:19:36,"Sure, and that's PTSD. That would be must be shell, shell, shell. That would be yeah, two more"
00:19:36,00:19:45,of my favorites from that list. One of them is tobacco and masturbation. Are those paired together?
00:19:45,00:19:49,"Yes, they are. There's a separate one for masturbation. And then tobacco and masturbation,"
00:19:49,00:19:54,"I believe is a different question. There's masturbation and syphilis, suppressed masturbation,"
00:19:54,00:20:02,"masturbation for 30 years, and my favorite deranged masturbation. That's your favorite one."
00:20:02,00:20:11,"Hobby. Yeah, this is like a list of our weekend. It's my to-do list."
00:20:11,00:20:16,Masturbation also thought to be caused by novel reading in the 19th century.
00:20:16,00:20:21,"Yep, I was reading an extract from a book called Disease and Sanity and Deformity written in 1860"
00:20:21,00:20:26,and it said masturbation often caused by novel reading. And the way you can spot masturbation
00:20:26,00:20:30,"in some, so obviously it's a terrible sin. I know how to spot it."
00:20:30,00:20:37,I don't need a guide. It's hard to identify. Give me a line up. I'll spot the guy.
00:20:37,00:20:44,It's number four. You can tell because he's got tobacco.
00:20:44,00:20:52,"Oh, how do you really spot it? You can spot it by some congastly eyes and clammy, greasy skin,"
00:20:52,00:20:56,"irritability, eyes averted when they meet us, basically all the symptoms of being a teenager."
00:20:56,00:21:03,"Oh, I had a good one. Sorry, I have a good thing in the, this was in 1869 and it was an essay by"
00:21:03,00:21:08,the Reverend JT Crane about novel reading about why it's so bad for you. And there was loads of
00:21:08,00:21:13,different reasons. Mostly it's about encouraging imagination and obviously that's not to be
00:21:13,00:21:19,"encouraged. But one of the things says that a novel reader is merged in the hero of the story,"
00:21:19,00:21:25,"handsome in person, brilliant in mind, endowed with every excellent and excellent and bearing"
00:21:25,00:21:30,"a name of at least three syllables. So basically if you read novels, it makes you think you have a name"
00:21:30,00:21:36,of three syllables. He soon imagines he is desperately in love with some little damsel in the
00:21:36,00:21:42,neighborhood. He begins to canvas her. She turns him down and eventually he commits suicide.
00:21:42,00:21:44,"And that's apparently if you read novels, that's what will happen to you."
00:21:44,00:21:50,"To every person who read a novel, really, it is extraordinary, but we don't realize that the novel"
00:21:50,00:21:58,"was a new form in the, in the 18th and early 19th centuries, but it's extraordinary, but it's"
00:21:58,00:22:03,extraordinary to think of a world in which novels were unknown and then suddenly people were writing
00:22:03,00:22:07,"these, no, they were, yeah, and it was a lot of worried of course typical to the time about the"
00:22:07,00:22:12,"effect on young women. Oh, it was all about women. How they would imagine themselves to be, as you say,"
00:22:12,00:22:17,"James, heroines and things like that. Yeah, yeah. That would lead them to abandon their studies. The"
00:22:17,00:22:21,"wholesome pursuits actually, Jane Austen mounts a very lively defense of novel reading in North"
00:22:21,00:22:26,"Anger Abbey. She says they contain everything that's excellent in mankind. Yeah, she didn't have"
00:22:26,00:22:31,"a vested interest. That's being a novel writer. Oh, you've blown the lid right on this one, James,"
00:22:31,00:22:37,"going in private eye now. Not just women, because what about Gertr's sorrows of your"
00:22:37,00:22:44,"verta? I like that it's Gertr's sorrows of verta. Yeah, I do like that. No, but that was the novel he"
00:22:44,00:22:49,"wrote, wasn't it? Yeah, it was the character. The main character commits suicide. One of the characters"
00:22:49,00:22:53,was very distinctively dressed. I can't really remember it. It was like he had yellow trousers or
00:22:53,00:22:57,and a red jacket or something that I commit suicide and then everyone supposedly copied him.
00:22:57,00:23:03,"And there was two thousand suicides in Europe blamed on that novel. God, wow. So they are dangerous."
00:23:03,00:23:08,"Yeah. Stay away from the novels. Okay, we've got to move on. Anyone got anything else so we're"
00:23:08,00:23:13,"chucking? Yeah, just some really good stuff about how they dealt with the mentally ill in the 19th"
00:23:13,00:23:18,"century. So when you were put into your asylum for novel reading, some things that you could have"
00:23:18,00:23:21,done to you were so freezing cold showers and shaved heads were often administered because it
00:23:21,00:23:25,was thought that you could release the madness through your head and you'd have an application of
00:23:25,00:23:30,blisters where your skin was burnt a lot. So you blistered up. So a blister would be prescribed.
00:23:30,00:23:36,"But the funnest, I think, a whirling chairs. So these were what they sound like, really,"
00:23:36,00:23:39,where you get sat in a chair tied to it and it spins around and around and around and it's
00:23:39,00:23:44,"supposed to send your madness propelling from your body. So there's a great account, for instance,"
00:23:44,00:23:49,"in 1822. Did it work? Yeah, it worked like a charm, like a dream. In all the accounts I've read,"
00:23:49,00:23:53,"I've read tons. It's always no improvement, no improvement. They never caught on. If there was a"
00:23:53,00:23:59,"transcript of just like the doctor's kitchen where they all met during the day, they would sound"
00:23:59,00:24:04,way more mad than anyone who was in that side. How's as your day been? I put him on the whirling
00:24:04,00:24:10,"charity, you know, propel his madness out of it. How did it go? It didn't work. I don't know if we've"
00:24:10,00:24:15,got a faulty chair. I don't know what's going on. Does the conversations would have been insane in
00:24:15,00:24:23,"that? You did a whirling fast enough. Okay, time for our final fact and that is Andy."
00:24:23,00:24:29,"Hello, my fact is that the Japanese Yakuza crime syndicate has its own website, which has a theme"
00:24:29,00:24:34,"tune designed to attract new members. Wait, so just very quickly because I know much about them."
00:24:34,00:24:41,"This is like a real kind of like menacing mafia like, yeah, except that there's a lot of acceptance"
00:24:41,00:24:48,"of them in Japanese society and it's not illegal to be a member, but it is illegal to do obviously a"
00:24:48,00:24:53,"lot of the activities, which is extortion or or rackets of one kind or another. So they have a very"
00:24:53,00:24:58,"interesting racket, which is basically large scale bribery where they buy shares in a company"
00:24:58,00:25:02,enough to get them to a shareholder's meeting where they can speak in public. And then they just find
00:25:02,00:25:07,"dirt on the company's executives, get in touch with them and say, if you don't pay us a significant"
00:25:07,00:25:11,"whack of money, we will come to the shareholder's meeting and read out all this terrible stuff about"
00:25:11,00:25:17,you. And so they do it. And the only effective method against them apparently is to have everyone's
00:25:17,00:25:24,shareholder meetings on the same day so that they can't be everywhere at once. So now 90% of
00:25:24,00:25:28,companies on the Tokyo Stock Exchange have their annual shareholder meetings on the same day now.
00:25:28,00:25:35,Yeah. Yeah. But it's very weirdly half accepted and then they see themselves as not being
00:25:35,00:25:40,"criminals. They see themselves as having a proper coat of honor and having, you know, like night and"
00:25:40,00:25:45,"they sometimes do, I mean, whether it's a cynical act or not, they, for instance, in 2011,"
00:25:45,00:25:51,"were some of the first people to get to the tsunami. The tsunami affected areas with aid, weren't they?"
00:25:51,00:25:57,"And in 1995, the same thing in Kobe in when the earthquake hit, they think that if the U.K.s hadn't"
00:25:57,00:26:02,"arrived in time with their aid, then there would have been much, much more damage done because"
00:26:02,00:26:06,"other agencies couldn't get in fast enough. Yeah. So they're controversial because they don't,"
00:26:06,00:26:13,they're not totally unpopular. They've got this thing. I read that they have a 12-page exam now
00:26:13,00:26:18,for all of our members. Yeah. Just to make sure because they keep getting in trouble for kind of
00:26:18,00:26:22,rookie errors and the way that laws are changing and so on. I think it's because they don't mind doing
00:26:22,00:26:27,"their big racketeering and stuff, but they don't want to get in with a brawl or just like"
00:26:27,00:26:31,"a lane, like a parking fine or something like that. They're trying to stop them doing the small things."
00:26:31,00:26:36,"But that's what's really funny because in a normal exam, if you were doing that for normal people"
00:26:36,00:26:40,"who just live quite a sort of legal life, it would be stuff like not parking your car in a certain spot."
00:26:40,00:26:48,"The stuff that they have, the topics that they cover are dumping industrial waste and vehicle theft,"
00:26:48,00:26:54,which is normal. I love that dumping industrial waste. They also have a newsletter that they do.
00:26:54,00:26:57,"Yeah. And it's, what do you want to know? No, no, you go for it."
00:26:57,00:27:03,So it goes only to the regular members. You have to be a proper full-time member to get one
00:27:03,00:27:09,"of the newsletters, but that's 28,000 people. And it's articles, motivational articles from the"
00:27:09,00:27:13,management about the difficult times we're going through it and I'm going to pick up soon.
00:27:13,00:27:20,"Haikus articles on fishing, in treaties to perform good works. So I think it's designed"
00:27:20,00:27:25,"partly as a little propaganda thing because they know that people outside, or also going to read it."
00:27:25,00:27:29,"Hey, these guys, they sound like pretty fun. We should go angling sometime with them."
00:27:29,00:27:33,"Did you go on to their website that you were talking about? Yeah, I did. And it's very old school."
00:27:33,00:27:39,"You can translate it into English, can't you? And a lot of it is about anti-Marijuana saying that"
00:27:39,00:27:42,"marijuana shouldn't be allowed in the country and all that kind of stuff. Yeah, exactly."
00:27:42,00:27:48,The banished drugs and purified the nation league is the front for it.
00:27:48,00:27:53,"Yeah, um, isn't there a branch with that's that is quite anti-drug zone? I got it's called the"
00:27:53,00:28:00,"Yamaguchi Gumi. Yeah, the Yamaguchi Gumi is genuinely quite anti-drugs or parts of it are very"
00:28:00,00:28:06,"anti-drugs. Yes, yes, they are. So they're selective about the crimes they commit. They are exactly."
00:28:06,00:28:12,It's more a kind of power extortion racketeering thing. I should say where I got this fact from.
00:28:12,00:28:16,"It's from this magazine called delayed gratification quarterly, which is a very cool magazine because"
00:28:16,00:28:20,"it's all news from three months ago, which has been filtered and written about really carefully."
00:28:20,00:28:25,And there's this incredible photo feature which you should check out by a guy called Anton Kuster's
00:28:25,00:28:29,who was allowed into the syndicate for two years to photograph them. Their tattoos are
00:28:29,00:28:34,"extraordinary. They often don't get a say. Oh, well, put these up on the side. Yeah,"
00:28:34,00:28:40,"yeah, there's a few Google Anton Kuster's. It's a K-U-S-T-E-R-S, then you'll find his photos often."
00:28:40,00:28:44,Right. This magazine just sounds like an excuse for a newspaper that was very slow getting to
00:28:44,00:28:51,the press. It sounds like if Greenland Sharks made a newspaper. I did genuinely try to get hold
00:28:51,00:28:56,"of delayed gratification quarterly on Monday last week and they said, come back on Wednesday."
00:28:56,00:29:03,"Hell's Angels, another, well, the US Department of Justice,"
00:29:03,00:29:09,"Consentism, a crime syndicate. And anyway, I was reading a news story on the other day where a"
00:29:09,00:29:14,German student moond a group of Hell's Angels and hold a puppy at them before escaping on a stolen
00:29:14,00:29:18,"bulldozer. So he ran outside, presumably, where every single one of their Harley-Davidson's"
00:29:18,00:29:24,"was sitting, thought, I need an escape vehicle. Need to get away from these guys real quick."
00:29:24,00:29:29,"Bulldozer. He must have thought that the dog would distract them somehow. Well, it must have,"
00:29:29,00:29:32,"because he was stopped by the police, not the Hell's Angels. Perhaps they thought they didn't"
00:29:32,00:29:36,"really care that much. They'd rather go on drinking. Did they have a theme tune as well? Oh,"
00:29:36,00:29:41,"speaking the theme tunes. Have we got, did you manage to find the Yakuza? Yeah. So here it is."
00:29:41,00:30:01,So there's nothing but my courage in this body. I'll trust myself to the life of the Yakuza and
00:30:01,00:30:06,follow this path I've decided on. Wow. It's not as jingly as I was hoping it would be.
00:30:06,00:30:11,"No, it's not really. I was hoping it was more like an advert trying to get you to a KFC or a McDonald's"
00:30:11,00:30:16,"or something like that. Yeah, I'm not signing up after hearing that. It should be like don't be a loser"
00:30:16,00:30:22,"join the Yakuza. Change has been the whole podcast planning that. So speaking of theme tunes,"
00:30:22,00:30:28,did you guys know that Salmon Rushdie wrote a theme tune once? No. For a TV show we all know and
00:30:28,00:30:34,love. Nope. He wrote a theme tune. It was titled The Best Things Begin With Bee and it was for
00:30:34,00:30:39,"the Burnley Building Society. He wrote the lyrics to it. You can dream a little, you can dream a lot,"
00:30:39,00:30:44,but the best dreams of all are the ones you've got building in the Burnley. That is fun. And I can't
00:30:44,00:30:48,find any evidence of online. I reckon he goes through the internet every day and make sure he
00:30:48,00:30:52,deletes every reference to it. That's great though. I didn't even know Burnley had a building
00:30:52,00:30:57,society. He didn't do its job. Apparently he was a very bad advertising. The one thing I know about
00:30:57,00:31:03,"Burnley is they drink more Benedictine than anywhere else in the world. Do they? Well, the best"
00:31:03,00:31:09,"things in life do begin with B. Benny Hottens working. They drink it in Benny and Hottens, which is"
00:31:09,00:31:14,Benedictine and Hotwater and it's a specific club especially in a certain area of Burnley and they
00:31:14,00:31:20,all drink Benedictine. Really? And then invest their money very sensibly. Yes. That's what they're into.
00:31:20,00:31:26,"There was something else. Oh yeah. He worked, he came up with a slogan for fresh cream cakes,"
00:31:26,00:31:32,"naughty but nice. Yes, he did. And he also invented the word irresistible. Yep."
00:31:32,00:31:38,For arrow chocolate bars. Pretty cool. So that obviously prefigured a lot of his magical realism
00:31:38,00:31:43,"later on. Can I tell you something about theme tunes? Yes, please. Yes. Okay, I have a couple of"
00:31:43,00:31:47,things about theme tunes which I really like. So you know the theme tune to Desert Island Discs?
00:31:47,00:31:57,Yes. Very nice. It was inspired by the view of a bogna region. Yeah. He composed a rotate
00:31:57,00:32:02,"looking across the lagoon towards Bogna. It's called the blue lagoon or something, isn't it?"
00:32:02,00:32:05,"Yeah, it is sleepy lagoon. Sleepy lagoon? Yeah. I kind of makes you want to go there."
00:32:05,00:32:10,"Good old bogna region, so it gets really bad rap, doesn't it? It does. Yeah. I shouldn't, as you say."
00:32:10,00:32:15,"It's like water just a quick interjection. Waterloo sunset was originally called Liverpool sunset,"
00:32:15,00:32:20,wasn't it? Because it was about the beauty of a sunset of Liverpool. And then it was changed because
00:32:20,00:32:25,I think the kinks felt that Waterloo might resonate with more people. Burnley sunset would have been
00:32:25,00:32:28,"better, wouldn't it? Burnley sunset. Yeah. The best things in life begin with B."
00:32:28,00:32:34,Yeah. Simon Rushdie is working on his sequel now. I'm Burnley building's a side sunset.
00:32:34,00:32:42,"Did you know that the Star Wars theme tune has lyrics? Well, I know. Yeah. What are the lyrics?"
00:32:42,00:32:46,"So, okay, basically, there was a holiday special that was made that George Lucas has since said"
00:32:46,00:32:50,"if he had enough time and a hammer, he would go around smashing every pirated copy out there"
00:32:50,00:32:56,that still exists. And it was basically the story of Chewbacca going home for Chewbacca
00:32:56,00:33:01,a wookie day with his family. During it had all these very surreal moments and all the actors from
00:33:01,00:33:07,"Star Wars were in it, including Princess Leia, who then sings the Star Wars theme tune with lyrics."
00:33:07,00:33:12,"Yeah. And the lyrics are roughly, we celebrate a day of peace, a day of harmony, a day of joy,"
00:33:12,00:33:16,"we can all share together joy. It's a really boring lyrics, but it's a really nice, it's a really"
00:33:16,00:33:24,"nice thing to the lyrics are out there for that song. There was, and I don't know if it's right to"
00:33:24,00:33:29,"call this a theme tune, but early American presidential candidates, they would have songs associated"
