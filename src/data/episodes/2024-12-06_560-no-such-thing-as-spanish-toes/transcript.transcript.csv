00:00:03,00:00:05,"Hi guys, I know what you're thinking, it's December"
00:00:05,00:00:08,and so all these brands are gonna start trying to
00:00:08,00:00:12,flog me all of their merch to give as gifts to people
00:00:12,00:00:14,where I can't think what else to give them.
00:00:14,00:00:17,And I bet that's what those fish are about to do as well.
00:00:17,00:00:20,"Well, yes and no, because look,"
00:00:20,00:00:22,our merch is not just any merch.
00:00:22,00:00:24,Our merch is really cool swag
00:00:24,00:00:26,that your bestest friends in the world
00:00:26,00:00:29,"and any fish fan in your life doesn't just want,"
00:00:29,00:00:30,they need it.
00:00:30,00:00:31,So what have we got to offer you?
00:00:31,00:00:33,"Well, we've got a pair of t-shirts"
00:00:33,00:00:36,and a lot of people on tour in Australia
00:00:36,00:00:38,where we just were sporting these t-shirts
00:00:38,00:00:41,"and they were looking, dare I say it, pretty damn cool."
00:00:41,00:00:42,For the more understated fan
00:00:42,00:00:44,"who doesn't quite wanna commit to a full t-shirt,"
00:00:44,00:00:48,we've got a couple of very stylish little pin badges.
00:00:48,00:00:50,"We also have our, no such thing as a fish,"
00:00:50,00:00:54,"ultimate guide, our tour book full of weird stuff"
00:00:54,00:00:55,we've written over the years.
00:00:55,00:00:57,James has got some poetry in there
00:00:57,00:00:58,and he's got a moss wall.
00:00:58,00:01:00,I think there's some photos of me
00:01:00,00:01:01,or nights out after shows
00:01:01,00:01:03,"that I never thought would see the light of day,"
00:01:03,00:01:04,that sort of thing.
00:01:04,00:01:05,"Anyway, to get all of that stuff,"
00:01:05,00:01:09,go to no such thing as a fish.com/shop
00:01:09,00:01:11,"and also, do you wanna get something"
00:01:11,00:01:13,a bit more hefty for somebody?
00:01:13,00:01:14,"Well, look no further"
00:01:14,00:01:17,because we have three books out between us.
00:01:17,00:01:20,Dan has a kid's book called Impossible Things.
00:01:20,00:01:23,You'll find that at the top of our website as well.
00:01:23,00:01:26,"Andy has a beginner's guide to breaking and entering,"
00:01:26,00:01:27,kind of thriller come comedy
00:01:27,00:01:31,and James and I have written a load of old balls
00:01:31,00:01:33,out of QI history of sport.
00:01:33,00:01:34,"So, there you go."
00:01:34,00:01:35,That's Christmas done for you.
00:01:35,00:01:36,You're welcome.
00:01:36,00:01:39,I am now off to audition for the shopping channel.
00:01:39,00:01:40,On with the show.
00:01:56,00:01:58,(audience cheering)
00:01:58,00:02:03,Hello and welcome to another episode
00:02:03,00:02:05,"of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:02:05,00:02:07,a weekly podcast.
00:02:07,00:02:09,"This week, coming to you all right"
00:02:09,00:02:11,for the Sydney Opera House.
00:02:11,00:02:18,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:02:18,00:02:20,"I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,"
00:02:20,00:02:23,Andrew Hunts and Murray and James Harkin.
00:02:23,00:02:24,"And once again,"
00:02:24,00:02:26,the four of us are gathered around the micropods
00:02:26,00:02:29,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:02:29,00:02:33,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:02:33,00:02:36,Starting with fact number one and that is James.
00:02:36,00:02:37,"Okay, my fact."
00:02:37,00:02:41,"Okay, my fact this week"
00:02:41,00:02:45,is that break dancing can make you go bold.
00:02:45,00:02:52,"For the people at home,"
00:02:52,00:02:53,we've put up a picture of the greatest
00:02:53,00:02:55,Australian sporting person.
00:02:55,00:02:58,"Ever perhaps, yeah."
00:02:58,00:02:59,"Yeah, Ray Gunn."
00:02:59,00:03:02,But this is a new study that's been done recently
00:03:02,00:03:07,"that describes break dancers' bulge, which is--"
00:03:07,00:03:09,It sounds so much sexier than it is.
00:03:09,00:03:11,"It's really not, well, you know,"
00:03:11,00:03:12,"takes all sorts, doesn't it?"
00:03:12,00:03:15,It's like it gives you a bit of a cone head.
00:03:15,00:03:17,"Okay, because your break dancing too much."
00:03:17,00:03:20,This was about a guy in his early 30s
00:03:20,00:03:24,who'd been doing head spins for more than 19 years.
00:03:24,00:03:25,"With breaks in between, right?"
00:03:25,00:03:28,"Yes, definitely."
00:03:28,00:03:30,Although it's five times a week
00:03:30,00:03:32,for one and a half hours at a time.
00:03:32,00:03:34,So he's doing a hell of a lot of head spins.
00:03:34,00:03:37,"And it was the case talked all about him,"
00:03:37,00:03:38,"but in the middle of the paper,"
00:03:38,00:03:40,"it said that they spoke into other breakers,"
00:03:40,00:03:42,"especially in Germany,"
00:03:42,00:03:46,and they found that 31% had had some kind of hair loss.
00:03:46,00:03:50,"Yeah, and you get this sort of lump of squishy matter"
00:03:50,00:03:52,"on top of your head, which is all you."
00:03:52,00:03:55,"But it's just you've been redistributed upwards, basically."
00:03:55,00:03:56,It's like you--
00:03:56,00:03:58,"Where does it come from, do you think?"
00:03:58,00:03:59,Where does it go? That's amazing.
00:03:59,00:04:01,Where does it come from?
00:04:01,00:04:03,"So you're defying gravity, basically."
00:04:03,00:04:04,You're heading upwards.
00:04:04,00:04:05,"You sort of-- Well, you're just--"
00:04:05,00:04:06,It's 'cause you're upside down.
00:04:06,00:04:08,"So gravity still wins, actually."
00:04:08,00:04:10,"Oh, actually, yeah. You're upside down."
00:04:10,00:04:12,"You're right, that's doing all the work, yeah."
00:04:12,00:04:14,"It's-- So this guy had an operation,"
00:04:14,00:04:15,and it can be dealt with with an operation.
00:04:15,00:04:18,He was really happy 'cause he said he can go out in public again
00:04:18,00:04:20,"and people said he looked, you know,"
00:04:20,00:04:22,he looked a lot better than when he had this cone head.
00:04:22,00:04:25,But some breakdancers will wear two hats to deal with hair loss.
00:04:25,00:04:27,"That's one strategy, really."
00:04:27,00:04:28,Why not wear one hat?
00:04:28,00:04:30,"What? They do wear one hat,"
00:04:30,00:04:32,and then they wear another hat on top of that.
00:04:32,00:04:34,That doesn't make you look even less like you've lost your hair.
00:04:34,00:04:36,"It's not, it's to cover your head."
00:04:36,00:04:37,It's to protect against the spinning.
00:04:37,00:04:39,"It's to stop you going bald, 'cause it's the friction on the floor."
00:04:39,00:04:42,"Sorry, so it's not to conceal the boldness."
00:04:42,00:04:44,No.
00:04:44,00:04:46,Just make the first hat not transparent.
00:04:46,00:04:49,"I've got to say, Anna, look, I'm a man in my 40s."
00:04:49,00:04:51,I've got 12 hats under this one.
00:04:51,00:04:55,"Yeah, so it's called, more broadly,"
00:04:55,00:04:59,"it's called Breakdancer Overuse Syndrome, this thing."
00:04:59,00:05:01,"And with the hair loss, with the bald thing,"
00:05:01,00:05:04,it's basically that the hair follicles become damaged
00:05:04,00:05:06,because you're rubbing them on the floor so much
00:05:06,00:05:08,and the hair just refuses to grow.
00:05:08,00:05:10,"Yeah, I went to Google it"
00:05:10,00:05:13,and I put Olympic Bolge and Breakdancing in.
00:05:13,00:05:15,OK. Yeah.
00:05:15,00:05:17,"And I forgot, and I think it's, we probably will all remember,"
00:05:17,00:05:20,but it's worth just saying that one of the finest moments
00:05:20,00:05:24,of the recent Olympics was the guy who lost the poll vote.
00:05:24,00:05:25,Yeah.
00:05:25,00:05:30,Because his Bolge took down the poll on the way over.
00:05:30,00:05:33,"So there were more embarrassing bolges in the Olympic, is what I mean."
00:05:33,00:05:36,"It feels like he sort of won the moral victory there, doesn't it?"
00:05:36,00:05:38,He may have lost the contest.
00:05:38,00:05:40,"Yeah, that's true."
00:05:40,00:05:41,"It's not a safe pursuit,"
00:05:41,00:05:43,"spinning around many, many times on your head."
00:05:43,00:05:44,I don't think it's very bad for you.
00:05:44,00:05:47,"A much more long-term thing is Breakdancing Neck,"
00:05:47,00:05:49,"which has been known about since the 1980s,"
00:05:49,00:05:53,which basically comes from putting so much weight on your neck
00:05:53,00:05:54,the whole time. It's spinal cord injury.
00:05:54,00:05:59,"But people do it so many times, the spinning round, that is."
00:05:59,00:06:01,"The record for the most spins,"
00:06:01,00:06:05,"and that both the male and female records are held by B-boys and B-girls,"
00:06:05,00:06:06,as I think they're called.
00:06:06,00:06:07,"But that is Breakdancers, yeah."
00:06:07,00:06:08,"Yeah, the spins on that."
00:06:08,00:06:10,"Well, you could just be into spinning around on your head."
00:06:10,00:06:12,(LAUGHTER)
00:06:12,00:06:13,I retract my comment.
00:06:13,00:06:15,(LAUGHTER)
00:06:15,00:06:16,Apologies.
00:06:16,00:06:19,"Imagine if in the Olympics in the B-boying,"
00:06:19,00:06:21,"someone came in who'd never done it before,"
00:06:21,00:06:23,but just loved spinning around on their heads.
00:06:23,00:06:25,"Are they getting gold if they just, the whole time,"
00:06:25,00:06:26,they just do one big spin?
00:06:26,00:06:29,Because I think the record is 137 spins.
00:06:29,00:06:30,"Oh, wow. Yeah."
00:06:30,00:06:33,"Complete full, yeah, yeah."
00:06:33,00:06:35,You were allowed to use your hands to keep the spin going.
00:06:35,00:06:37,"Oh, are you? OK."
00:06:37,00:06:40,"This year, it was, because it was the Paris Olympics,"
00:06:40,00:06:42,"and it was held, I really just like this,"
00:06:42,00:06:43,"in the Place de la Concorde,"
00:06:43,00:06:47,which is where Marie Antoinette was guillotined 230 years ago.
00:06:47,00:06:49,Wow. And that's just nice.
00:06:49,00:06:51,"That just sort of matches, doesn't it?"
00:06:51,00:06:53,Do you think her head spun around as it came up there?
00:06:53,00:06:55,"Yeah, it probably did."
00:06:55,00:06:56,"Do you think if she had more head,"
00:06:56,00:06:57,"they would have just lobbed that bit off,"
00:06:57,00:06:59,"and she would have sort of, like,"
00:06:59,00:07:01,just painted a little face on the top cone.
00:07:01,00:07:03,(LAUGHTER)
00:07:03,00:07:05,With her big rough around her head.
00:07:05,00:07:07,"I should just say, I think we're showing ourselves up"
00:07:07,00:07:10,"as massive docks because it isn't called Breakdancing,"
00:07:10,00:07:12,it is called B-boying and B-girling.
00:07:12,00:07:13,"Yeah. Yeah, it's..."
00:07:13,00:07:16,"Breakdancing is a very, very uncool word to use."
00:07:16,00:07:18,"Breaking. You say breaking, isn't it?"
00:07:18,00:07:19,Because I'm breaking. Yeah.
00:07:19,00:07:22,But I gather it's one of the four pillars of hip-hop.
00:07:22,00:07:23,"Islam. Oh, yeah, hip-hop. Sorry."
00:07:23,00:07:26,(LAUGHTER)
00:07:26,00:07:29,"Five of Islam, four of hip-hop,"
00:07:29,00:07:32,three for any sort of podium.
00:07:32,00:07:36,"Anyway, and the others, I mean, I don't need to say it to you guys,"
00:07:36,00:07:38,"but they're DJing, MCing and graffiti."
00:07:38,00:07:41,"Oh, OK. Is that Islam still?"
00:07:41,00:07:42,That's Islam. (LAUGHTER)
00:07:42,00:07:44,"Because with the breakdancing,"
00:07:44,00:07:47,"that was coined by the newspapers,"
00:07:47,00:07:49,whereas the B-boys and B-girlers themselves
00:07:49,00:07:50,wouldn't call it breakdancing.
00:07:50,00:07:52,Did they call it breaking at the start? Yes.
00:07:52,00:07:54,Because it's the break in the music.
00:07:54,00:07:56,"It's where you don't have lyrics, right?"
00:07:56,00:07:58,"Yeah, so you have the song, song, song, song, song, song,"
00:07:58,00:08:00,then you have a little break where it's just the music.
00:08:00,00:08:01,"Drum. Oh, it's a drum, right?"
00:08:01,00:08:03,"Oh, it's a drum, stuff like that."
00:08:03,00:08:05,And then the DJs would just repeat that again and again
00:08:05,00:08:07,and again so that people could dance in that little break.
00:08:07,00:08:10,I don't think we've ever looked so uncool in our lives.
00:08:10,00:08:13,I don't know. Then what just happened just then?
00:08:13,00:08:14,What are you talking about?
00:08:14,00:08:17,We're passing ourselves off as hip-hop aficionados.
00:08:17,00:08:21,"Yeah, OK. I want to talk about the coolest person alive,"
00:08:21,00:08:23,"speaking of hip-hop. Oh, I love that, please."
00:08:23,00:08:24,I think the coolest person who ever happened.
00:08:24,00:08:25,I'm right here.
00:08:25,00:08:27,"I know, I don't want to embarrass you, James."
00:08:27,00:08:28,"No, your second coolest,"
00:08:28,00:08:31,"coolest is the person who invented hip-hop,"
00:08:31,00:08:34,or the person because of whom hip-hop came about.
00:08:34,00:08:37,I just think it's amazing that it was a schoolgirl
00:08:37,00:08:40,who wanted to raise money to buy some new clothes for school.
00:08:40,00:08:42,Really? It's so cool.
00:08:42,00:08:45,"1973, there's a schoolgirl called Cindy Campbell"
00:08:45,00:08:49,and her parents have migrated in the previous five years or so
00:08:49,00:08:50,from Jamaica to the US.
00:08:50,00:08:53,"And she wants to look a bit cooler, buy some new school clothes."
00:08:53,00:08:55,"She's like, ""I'll just throw a big house party."""
00:08:55,00:08:57,"Now, I tried to throw parties when I was 15"
00:08:57,00:08:59,and what happened to her did not happen to me.
00:08:59,00:09:01,Everyone in the neighborhood came.
00:09:01,00:09:04,"She asked her brother, her big brother to DJ,"
00:09:04,00:09:06,a guy called DJ Cool Hook.
00:09:06,00:09:08,I don't think he was christened like that.
00:09:08,00:09:12,"In fact, he was christened Clive, which is not a cool name."
00:09:12,00:09:15,And that was the birth of hip-hop.
00:09:15,00:09:18,"And everyone in the hip-hop movement knows that this,"
00:09:18,00:09:20,"like, this is the origin story."
00:09:20,00:09:22,"A 16, 15, 16-year-old girl went,"
00:09:22,00:09:24,"""I'm going to have a little party in my parents' house."""
00:09:24,00:09:26,And that's where hip-hop was born.
00:09:26,00:09:28,"And everyone says that they were there, don't they?"
00:09:28,00:09:31,"Like, anyone who was there near the start of breakdancing,"
00:09:31,00:09:33,"they all say, ""Well, I was at the party, of course."""
00:09:33,00:09:35,"Yeah, I was there."
00:09:35,00:09:37,"Weirdly, in parental connections, there's another one,"
00:09:37,00:09:41,"because I think Australia's best male breakdancers,"
00:09:41,00:09:43,"Jeff Dunn, is that correct?"
00:09:43,00:09:44,J-Attack.
00:09:44,00:09:47,"Oh, so you guys aren't cool either, that's good."
00:09:47,00:09:48,What a surprise.
00:09:48,00:09:49,J-Attack.
00:09:49,00:09:50,J-Attack.
00:09:50,00:09:54,"J-Attack, as he's known, or Jeff, is 16,"
00:09:54,00:09:56,and his mum is present at all his gigs.
00:09:56,00:09:58,"He's the best in the world, best in Australia."
00:09:58,00:09:59,"Best Australian man, yeah, yeah."
00:09:59,00:10:03,"But the thing I didn't know about Olympic break-king,"
00:10:03,00:10:04,"I'm just going to say breakdancing,"
00:10:04,00:10:06,"I'm not fooling anyone,"
00:10:06,00:10:08,"is that I thought that, like, ice skating,"
00:10:08,00:10:09,you get to pick your own music.
00:10:09,00:10:11,"You know, you have your tune, you go out to that,"
00:10:11,00:10:13,"and then, and it's not the case."
00:10:13,00:10:16,"In breakdancing, the DJ selects the tune,"
00:10:16,00:10:17,and you just have to adapt to that.
00:10:17,00:10:18,You have to improvise to it.
00:10:18,00:10:19,You have to improvise.
00:10:19,00:10:22,"So that's part of the, like, it's execution and originality,"
00:10:22,00:10:24,"and your vocab of moves and technique,"
00:10:24,00:10:25,all of it counts in the judges.
00:10:25,00:10:26,"Oh, your vocab of moves, eh?"
00:10:26,00:10:28,"Yeah, I was just..."
00:10:28,00:10:29,I'm desperately trying to get it back
00:10:29,00:10:32,"to something vocabulary-based, and, um..."
00:10:32,00:10:33,"But so, for the Olympics, there was a problem."
00:10:33,00:10:36,"They couldn't just let the DJs play whatever they wanted,"
00:10:36,00:10:38,"because it's going out on telly,"
00:10:38,00:10:40,so it has to be music that they've cleared the rights to.
00:10:40,00:10:44,"Oh! So they had a library of 390 songs,"
00:10:44,00:10:45,which the rights have been cleared.
00:10:45,00:10:48,"So 390 is a lot of songs you probably couldn't learn,"
00:10:48,00:10:50,"you know, all of them and react in time."
00:10:50,00:10:53,"Yeah. And also, the DJs were not allowed to spend any time at all"
00:10:53,00:10:54,"with the breakdancers,"
00:10:54,00:10:56,"in case the breakdancers lean over and said,"
00:10:56,00:10:58,"""Oh, can you play, like, Eleanor Rigby,"" or whatever."
00:10:58,00:10:59,"Like, whatever."
00:10:59,00:11:01,LAUGHTER
00:11:01,00:11:03,Classic breakdance.
00:11:03,00:11:05,"You know what I mean, like, a silent night, whatever."
00:11:05,00:11:07,"Like, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:11:07,00:11:09,Have you thought about entering?
00:11:09,00:11:11,"I have, like, I don't know."
00:11:11,00:11:13,"You know what's weird, Andy? You mentioned Eleanor Rigby."
00:11:13,00:11:15,"Paul McCartney, who wrote that song,"
00:11:15,00:11:19,spends five minutes every morning upside down on his head.
00:11:19,00:11:21,Wow. Even at this age...
00:11:21,00:11:22,Spinning?
00:11:22,00:11:25,"I think it's static. I think he's, yeah."
00:11:25,00:11:26,That's pretty good.
00:11:26,00:11:29,"So he does yoga, and every morning, he's hit 80s, you know?"
00:11:29,00:11:32,"He's upside down on his head for five solid minutes,"
00:11:32,00:11:34,and I want to see if the cone has arrived.
00:11:34,00:11:36,LAUGHTER
00:11:36,00:11:38,"Possibly has, right?"
00:11:38,00:11:39,Can I just talk about the...
00:11:39,00:11:42,"If you're too cool even for breaking, as I am,"
00:11:42,00:11:45,what you're really into is crumping.
00:11:45,00:11:46,Do you guys know about crumping?
00:11:46,00:11:47,Crumping? No.
00:11:47,00:11:49,Can I just get a poll to judge how cool this audience is?
00:11:49,00:11:51,Who knows about crumping?
00:11:51,00:11:52,CHEERING
00:11:52,00:11:53,They all know. Quite a few.
00:11:53,00:11:55,Do they? It's basically clowning.
00:11:55,00:11:59,"But I find this so cool, because hip-hop is the epitome of cool, right?"
00:11:59,00:12:04,"But crumping is a key, kind of new part of hip-hop dance culture,"
00:12:04,00:12:06,and it was invented by a children's birthday clown
00:12:06,00:12:08,"called Tommy the Clown in the 1990s,"
00:12:08,00:12:10,"who wanted to liven up kids' birthday parties,"
00:12:10,00:12:15,"so he started, like, jerking his body in, kind of, really asymmetrical ways,"
00:12:15,00:12:17,"and he'd keep... It's where you keep one bit of your body still,"
00:12:17,00:12:20,"and then you just, like, jerk one tiny bit of it."
00:12:20,00:12:22,It looks cooler than what I'd just do with my hand on stage.
00:12:22,00:12:27,"And it became huge, and it's the big thing in hip-hop now,"
00:12:27,00:12:29,and people go and do it in full clown gear.
00:12:29,00:12:31,Wow. I'm really interested to know
00:12:31,00:12:34,"what the people of the audience thought it was,"
00:12:34,00:12:36,who all said they knew what it was.
00:12:36,00:12:40,"Yeah. Was that it? Well, they're all in clown suits, so I assume..."
00:12:40,00:12:43,"You all came in one cart, didn't you, today?"
00:12:43,00:12:49,"Hey, we need to move on now to our next fact."
00:12:49,00:12:53,"It is time for fact number two, and that is Anna."
00:12:53,00:12:55,"My fact this week is that in North Korea,"
00:12:55,00:12:58,it's illegal to rest your cup of tea on a newspaper
00:12:58,00:13:02,if that newspaper has a picture of Kim Il-sung on it.
00:13:02,00:13:07,And how many newspapers don't have a picture of Kim Il-sung on them?
00:13:07,00:13:09,"That's the question I think quite a lot of them do,"
00:13:09,00:13:13,"and, in fact, it's the two subsequent Kims, as well, I believe."
00:13:13,00:13:17,So it's probably quite hard in North Korea to avoid a newspaper
00:13:17,00:13:21,"with any of their dear leaders in it, and it's very, very illegal."
00:13:21,00:13:24,"So I read this in an interview, it was an interview in 2010,"
00:13:24,00:13:27,"but I've checked it out, it still is the case from what we know,"
00:13:27,00:13:30,"but an interview with a teenage girl who'd escaped from North Korea,"
00:13:30,00:13:32,"crossed the border into China,"
00:13:32,00:13:35,"and she was saying that any defacement of the image of Kim Il-sung,"
00:13:35,00:13:38,"of course, the founder of North Korea, was punished."
00:13:38,00:13:42,"So if you destroyed any notes, any bank notes with his face on them,"
00:13:42,00:13:45,"you're shot, and it's, yeah, the newspaper thing,"
00:13:45,00:13:48,"illegal to put anything on that newspaper,"
00:13:48,00:13:51,"which I don't know if there's a coaster, I don't know if that excuses you."
00:13:51,00:13:53,His face is probably on the coaster.
00:13:53,00:13:57,"Yes, it's illegal to put your tea on a coaster with the face on."
00:13:57,00:13:59,"No, you should put it on the coaster."
00:13:59,00:14:02,"In fact, it's punishable to not put it on the coaster."
00:14:02,00:14:04,"In my house, it's punishable not to use a coaster."
00:14:04,00:14:06,I'm trying to say.
00:14:06,00:14:08,"And again, that's just shot straight up, isn't it?"
00:14:08,00:14:09,"Yeah, that's right, yeah."
00:14:09,00:14:12,So these laws are actually quite common around the world
00:14:12,00:14:16,"to various degrees, right, they're called less majest, are they called?"
00:14:16,00:14:19,And it's basically insulting your leaders.
00:14:19,00:14:24,"And in the UK, in fact, the Trees and Felony Act of 1848"
00:14:24,00:14:28,makes it an offence to say that you want the monarchy to be abolished.
00:14:28,00:14:29,"Oh, what?"
00:14:29,00:14:32,"You can get life imprisonment under the act,"
00:14:32,00:14:35,"or in theory, you could be transported to Australia."
00:14:35,00:14:39,[LAUGHTER]
00:14:39,00:14:42,Is that... Is that too soon?
00:14:42,00:14:43,That's true.
00:14:43,00:14:44,Is that still on the books?
00:14:44,00:14:47,"It is still on the books, but obviously they would never do anything about it."
00:14:47,00:14:48,Very rarely prosecuted.
00:14:48,00:14:50,"They would never be prosecuted,"
00:14:50,00:14:53,"but they keep it on the books because of, you know, just ceremonial reasons."
00:14:53,00:14:54,Just in case.
00:14:54,00:14:58,"Well, yeah, just be a bit more careful about what you say these days, Australia."
00:14:58,00:15:01,We've heard some of the rumblings.
00:15:01,00:15:04,"This is, I mean, so as you say, this is around the globe."
00:15:04,00:15:07,"Remember when we did, so back in the UK,"
00:15:07,00:15:11,we did a BBC Two show version of our show called No Such Thing as the News.
00:15:11,00:15:17,"And, yeah, that's roughly how many people watched it as well."
00:15:17,00:15:21,But we were told there was at one point that we were going to do a fact
00:15:21,00:15:25,"about the King of Thailand, and they said to us, the BBC, you can't."
00:15:25,00:15:28,You can't do it because if anyone who's connected to your family lives there
00:15:28,00:15:32,"and they make that connection by you insulting the King of Thailand,"
00:15:32,00:15:35,"you will go to jail if you go to Thailand, or one of your family will."
00:15:35,00:15:38,"And they would have to bring all of the BBC reporters out of Thailand,"
00:15:38,00:15:40,they told us if we did that.
00:15:40,00:15:42,It was the only thing we weren't allowed to make jokes about.
00:15:42,00:15:43,That's true.
00:15:43,00:15:46,"But we're not currently planning a tour to Thailand, so let's get into it."
00:15:46,00:15:47,100%.
00:15:47,00:15:49,And let's have some laughs.
00:15:49,00:15:50,I still have family there.
00:15:50,00:15:53,"OK, well, OK, well, sorry for them, Dan."
00:15:53,00:15:56,"I don't like them that much though, so it's fine."
00:15:56,00:15:58,"You knock yourself out, buddy."
00:15:58,00:16:00,"So it's still very much on the books,"
00:16:00,00:16:03,"and the weird thing about it is anyone can complain about anyone,"
00:16:03,00:16:05,and the police have to start an investigation.
00:16:05,00:16:08,"I could just go to the police and say, I heard James being a bit rude about the King."
00:16:08,00:16:10,And you'll be... I didn't.
00:16:10,00:16:11,"Well, I heard it."
00:16:11,00:16:12,What?
00:16:12,00:16:15,And then an investigation is automatically opened.
00:16:15,00:16:19,"So one guy got his brother locked up for a year with a Les Majest accusation,"
00:16:19,00:16:21,"and actually, their dogs had just got into a fight,"
00:16:21,00:16:23,and he was annoyed with his brother.
00:16:23,00:16:24,"Oh, my God."
00:16:24,00:16:25,It's an inefficient system.
00:16:25,00:16:29,There used to be a system in ancient Rome whereby the person in power
00:16:29,00:16:33,needed to be reminded not to go too far.
00:16:33,00:16:34,They were known as humblers.
00:16:34,00:16:38,"If the Roman emperor was speaking, the humbler behind would go,"
00:16:38,00:16:39,"""Yeah, but you're still a bit shit, mate."""
00:16:39,00:16:43,"Like, they would just say things to bring them back down."
00:16:43,00:16:45,Australian version of an ancient Roman custom.
00:16:45,00:16:47,I've ever heard.
00:16:47,00:16:50,"""Yeah, nah, you're not great at all. Nah, nah, nah, nah."""
00:16:50,00:16:51,"""You're not all that."""
00:16:51,00:16:52,"Yeah, and that used to be a thing."
00:16:52,00:16:53,Was it real?
00:16:53,00:16:57,"I've read in multiple places that it's been a long time, Andy."
00:16:57,00:16:58,I don't know.
00:16:58,00:16:59,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:16:59,00:17:01,"Well, it's the same old as a jester, I suppose, really, wasn't it?"
00:17:01,00:17:02,Yes.
00:17:02,00:17:03,"If there's a fine line, you have to walk."
00:17:03,00:17:06,"Your job is sort of to take the piss out of the King,"
00:17:06,00:17:09,but be very careful when you do it.
00:17:09,00:17:13,"I think there was one of my favourites is Francis I, 16th century jester."
00:17:13,00:17:15,"I'm sure we all remember, Triboulay."
00:17:15,00:17:17,He used to do quite fun things.
00:17:17,00:17:19,"So once he slapped the King on the buttocks,"
00:17:19,00:17:21,"and that was one step too far, the King said,"
00:17:21,00:17:24,"""Sorry, one step too far, I'm going to execute you now."""
00:17:24,00:17:28,Unless you can think of something more insulting than that slap.
00:17:28,00:17:29,"And so, of course, he replied,"
00:17:29,00:17:31,"""I'm so sorry, sir, I didn't mean to do it."
00:17:31,00:17:33,"I mistook you for your queen."""
00:17:33,00:17:35,Nice.
00:17:35,00:17:36,Got that off.
00:17:36,00:17:38,"You know, you got to hand it to him."
00:17:38,00:17:39,"Yeah, that's pretty good."
00:17:39,00:17:42,Is it even more insulting to imply he's got a womanly bottom?
00:17:42,00:17:44,Is that... I'm struggling to work out why that's an insult.
00:17:44,00:17:48,I think he's saying that his wife is so disgusting
00:17:48,00:17:50,that her bear arms looked like that.
00:17:50,00:17:53,"Wait, the arses were bare? Why were the arses bare?"
00:17:53,00:17:57,They all went around dressed like Donald Duck in the 16th century.
00:17:57,00:17:59,I didn't know that.
00:17:59,00:18:00,That's amazing.
00:18:00,00:18:02,"No, you're right. They probably weren't naked."
00:18:02,00:18:05,"One of the things, just jumping back to North Korea quickly,"
00:18:05,00:18:08,"and Kim Il-sung and the descendants of him,"
00:18:08,00:18:11,"is that you're not allowed to insult,"
00:18:11,00:18:14,but the flip side of it is you actively constantly need to praise.
00:18:14,00:18:18,"There are over 34,000 statues of Kim Il-sung,"
00:18:18,00:18:21,"who is still the president of North Korea,"
00:18:21,00:18:23,"despite being dead for many, many years."
00:18:23,00:18:25,He's still an actively running president.
00:18:25,00:18:28,"Well, he's not actively running."
00:18:28,00:18:31,He's hardly walking these days.
00:18:31,00:18:34,But he's still listed as the president.
00:18:34,00:18:35,Forever president.
00:18:35,00:18:38,Even a tourist phrase book has helpful icebreakers
00:18:38,00:18:40,in a section when you're sightseeing the city.
00:18:40,00:18:43,"It'll say things like, ""Why don't you just randomly say to someone,"
00:18:43,00:18:47,'Comrade Kim Il-sung was the most distinguished leader of our times.'
00:18:47,00:18:48,"That will break the ice."""
00:18:48,00:18:50,"And then there was a journalist, a Western journalist,"
00:18:50,00:18:53,who went over there and he went to the zoo.
00:18:53,00:18:56,"And the first thing that they showed him was a parrot,"
00:18:56,00:18:58,"who has learned to squawk,"
00:18:58,00:19:01,"""Long live the great leader, Comrade Kim Il-sung!"""
00:19:01,00:19:03,"That's what you see at the zoo,"
00:19:03,00:19:07,"which, by the way, sounds like the most fucked-up zoo I've ever read about."
00:19:07,00:19:11,They've got basketball playing monkeys.
00:19:11,00:19:15,They've got a dove that is part of a figure skating routine.
00:19:15,00:19:19,They've got a dog who is trained to manipulate an abacus
00:19:19,00:19:21,and just do sums in the corner.
00:19:21,00:19:24,And then there's a monkey that just smokes ciggies all day long.
00:19:24,00:19:26,"It's just, you walk up, I've seen photos."
00:19:26,00:19:29,"It's just got a pack of ciggies and it just pulls out a new one each time,"
00:19:29,00:19:31,"lights it up, and he's like..."
00:19:31,00:19:33,"""Oh, I'm not really enjoying this basketball."""
00:19:33,00:19:39,"How much do I pay for it? Rack this up on your abacus, dude."
00:19:39,00:19:43,The one person who is very positive to the leaders of North Korea
00:19:43,00:19:45,is their poet laureate.
00:19:45,00:19:48,"And he became very, very close to Kim Jong-il,"
00:19:48,00:19:51,"and so much so that when he wrote a really long poem,"
00:19:51,00:19:54,he got immediately turned into the law of the land.
00:19:54,00:19:55,Isn't that amazing?
00:19:55,00:19:58,I find poems hard to interpret the best of times.
00:19:58,00:19:59,I don't know how I translate it into the law.
00:19:59,00:20:01,"Say something about it, like no lettering or what..."
00:20:01,00:20:07,"It's kind of tells the history of the great leaders and stuff like that,"
00:20:07,00:20:09,and it becomes part of the national history.
00:20:09,00:20:10,So it's become kind of canon.
00:20:10,00:20:11,"Yeah, yeah."
00:20:11,00:20:14,He's got to be careful when he's writing because it is illegal.
00:20:14,00:20:18,"If you're writing any of the Kim's names, Kim Jong-un's name,"
00:20:18,00:20:20,it's illegal to let it run over two lines.
00:20:20,00:20:24,"So, you know, if you're publishing a book and you have to let a word fall over two lines,"
00:20:24,00:20:26,that's very illegal. Don't do that.
00:20:26,00:20:29,"If you're writing a letter and you're getting up close to the edge,"
00:20:29,00:20:30,"you've got to start a new line, mate."
00:20:30,00:20:32,Don't split those guys up.
00:20:32,00:20:32,I'm always doing that.
00:20:32,00:20:36,Is it really insulting if you start writing it and you realise you're running out of space
00:20:36,00:20:38,and write it smaller and smaller and smaller?
00:20:38,00:20:40,I think that's extreme torture.
00:20:40,00:20:41,"Oh, my God."
00:20:41,00:20:43,Do you know what the People's Instrument is in North Korea?
00:20:43,00:20:44,I rather like this.
00:20:44,00:20:46,Can we hazard a guess?
00:20:46,00:20:48,You can have as many guesses as you like.
00:20:48,00:20:49,I'd be impressed if you get asked.
00:20:49,00:20:50,"So what was the question, sorry?"
00:20:50,00:20:52,What is the People's Instrument?
00:20:52,00:20:52,Oh.
00:20:52,00:20:53,Kazoo.
00:20:53,00:20:53,Musical instrument.
00:20:53,00:20:54,Not kazoo.
00:20:54,00:20:54,Good guess.
00:20:54,00:20:55,Theramen.
00:20:55,00:20:56,Theramen is nice.
00:20:56,00:20:56,No.
00:20:56,00:20:58,"It's lower tech, but not much lower tech."
00:20:58,00:20:59,Recorder.
00:20:59,00:21:00,Higher tech.
00:21:00,00:21:01,Synthesiser.
00:21:01,00:21:03,Nearly accordion.
00:21:03,00:21:05,Someone shouted out in the audience and it is the accordion.
00:21:05,00:21:06,OK.
00:21:06,00:21:07,There he is.
00:21:07,00:21:08,Wow.
00:21:08,00:21:08,OK.
00:21:08,00:21:12,"If you wanted to be a teacher in North Korea in the 1990s,"
00:21:12,00:21:14,you had to first pass an accordion exam.
00:21:14,00:21:15,Wow.
00:21:15,00:21:15,Really?
00:21:15,00:21:18,"Because it was for songs, basically,"
00:21:18,00:21:20,"so you could lead propaganda songs, things like that."
00:21:20,00:21:20,Wow.
00:21:20,00:21:21,Yeah.
00:21:21,00:21:24,There's one very famous story about Kim Jong Il
00:21:24,00:21:28,"that he played 18 holes of golf, scoring 34,"
00:21:28,00:21:30,"including four holes in one,"
00:21:30,00:21:31,which would be 20 shots better
00:21:31,00:21:34,than the best goal I ever shot by anyone else on Earth
00:21:34,00:21:35,with playing golf.
00:21:35,00:21:36,Right.
00:21:36,00:21:36,Yeah.
00:21:36,00:21:39,"But actually, there's been more recent stories about it,"
00:21:39,00:21:43,and what we think is that they used a different way of scoring.
00:21:43,00:21:46,So a par would be zero points.
00:21:46,00:21:47,A bogey would be one.
00:21:47,00:21:49,"So like, if you do what you're supposed to do,"
00:21:49,00:21:51,you would get zero.
00:21:51,00:21:52,"If you're slightly worse, you would get one."
00:21:52,00:21:55,"If you're much worse, you would get two, etc., etc."
00:21:55,00:21:56,"And if that's true,"
00:21:56,00:21:58,"then he would have actually shot 106,"
00:21:58,00:22:00,"which is quite good for someone in the first game,"
00:22:00,00:22:02,"but not impossible, I would say."
00:22:02,00:22:04,Are you saying it could be the case
00:22:04,00:22:05,with this whole North Korean thing?
00:22:05,00:22:07,We've just been misunderstanding them the whole time.
00:22:07,00:22:09,"Well, the truth is that a lot of it"
00:22:09,00:22:11,comes from South Korean propaganda.
00:22:11,00:22:11,"Totally, yeah."
00:22:11,00:22:13,"A lot of the things that we say and that we learn,"
00:22:13,00:22:15,"it comes through South Korean press,"
00:22:15,00:22:16,"who have an axe to grind, of course."
00:22:16,00:22:17,"Totally, yeah."
00:22:17,00:22:19,"Well, this is from People in Exile."
00:22:19,00:22:21,That's basically the only place you get actual information
00:22:21,00:22:23,is people who have got away and said early.
00:22:23,00:22:24,Absolutely.
00:22:24,00:22:26,So it might be that Kim Jong-il
00:22:26,00:22:28,was not lying about his golf.
00:22:28,00:22:29,"Donald Trump, on the other hand,"
00:22:29,00:22:35,he claims to be scoring 73 on a regular basis at golf.
00:22:35,00:22:35,"And if he did that,"
00:22:35,00:22:38,he would be the best golfer of his age in the world.
00:22:38,00:22:39,"Oh, okay."
00:22:39,00:22:40,That's fair enough.
00:22:40,00:22:42,"Well, he's pretty good at stuff, isn't he?"
00:22:42,00:22:47,"Just for clarity, I didn't vote for him."
00:22:47,00:22:49,I didn't get a vote.
00:22:49,00:22:50,Wish I could have.
00:22:52,00:22:54,"But Kim Jong-il, Kim Il-sung, by the way,"
00:22:54,00:22:58,"I think the North Koreans are very good at sometimes saying,"
00:22:58,00:22:59,"actually, do you know what?"
00:22:59,00:23:00,We were lying about that.
00:23:00,00:23:04,"Because recently, they revealed that Kim Il-sung cannot,"
00:23:04,00:23:07,"in fact, manage to teleport by folding space,"
00:23:07,00:23:12,which previously they suggested he absolutely could.
00:23:12,00:23:13,"Yeah, yeah."
00:23:13,00:23:16,"Since he's died,"
00:23:16,00:23:18,he's stopped being able to teleport by folding space.
00:23:18,00:23:19,"That's probably what that is, yes."
00:23:19,00:23:20,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:23:20,00:23:21,"Okay, so he still could do it"
00:23:21,00:23:22,"while he was alive, check that out."
00:23:22,00:23:26,"He was born supposedly, again, who knows,"
00:23:26,00:23:27,"on the day the Titanic sank,"
00:23:27,00:23:31,which is a harbinger of the fall of Western imperialism.
00:23:31,00:23:33,"Oh, is that why?"
00:23:33,00:23:33,Is it?
00:23:33,00:23:34,Is that why?
00:23:34,00:23:34,It's what they say it is.
00:23:34,00:23:35,"Mm-hmm, right."
00:23:35,00:23:36,Yep.
00:23:36,00:23:38,Then he wrote an eight-volume memoir about his life.
00:23:38,00:23:39,Okay.
00:23:39,00:23:40,You read it?
00:23:40,00:23:40,I haven't read it.
00:23:40,00:23:42,I think that's too long.
00:23:42,00:23:42,"Well, don't judge."
00:23:42,00:23:44,I think it could have done with the day.
00:23:44,00:23:45,That's too many.
00:23:45,00:23:46,"Yeah, yeah."
00:23:46,00:23:47,"We're going to have to move on in a minute, guys."
00:23:47,00:23:49,"Okay, well, just quickly back to insulting leaders."
00:23:49,00:23:50,Yeah.
00:23:50,00:23:52,"There was someone called Danny Lim,"
00:23:52,00:23:54,who people in the audience might remember.
00:23:54,00:23:57,Who's that?
00:23:57,00:23:58,"About seven or eight years ago,"
00:23:58,00:24:00,"he had a sign that said,"
00:24:00,00:24:02,"""People can change Tony."
00:24:02,00:24:05,"You can't,"" referring to Tony Abbott."
00:24:05,00:24:05,Abbott?
00:24:05,00:24:06,Abbott.
00:24:06,00:24:08,But the letter A in the word can't
00:24:08,00:24:10,had been turned upside down
00:24:10,00:24:13,and sort of rounded at the bottom.
00:24:13,00:24:13,"Oh, weird."
00:24:13,00:24:16,And with the cross kind of not very visible.
00:24:16,00:24:17,"Oh, strange."
00:24:17,00:24:18,That must have made it very hard
00:24:18,00:24:19,to understand what the sign was.
00:24:19,00:24:20,"Yeah, people..."
00:24:20,00:24:23,"I'll be honest, people misunderstood it quite a lot."
00:24:23,00:24:24,"Oh, no."
00:24:24,00:24:26,But he did get off because the judge ruled
00:24:26,00:24:28,that he hadn't unequivocably used the word...
00:24:28,00:24:30,"Abbott, right, right, right."
00:24:30,00:24:30,Abbott.
00:24:30,00:24:33,Fair enough.
00:24:33,00:24:40,"It is time for fact number three,"
00:24:40,00:24:42,and that is my fact.
00:24:42,00:24:45,"My fact this week is that in the UK,"
00:24:45,00:24:47,there is a football competition
00:24:47,00:24:49,called the Tolstoy Cup.
00:24:49,00:24:51,In which the War Study Department
00:24:51,00:24:53,at King's College London
00:24:53,00:24:55,takes on the Peace Studies Department
00:24:55,00:24:58,at the University of Bradford.
00:24:58,00:25:00,Peace is currently beating war 10 to 3.
00:25:00,00:25:06,"It's not real life, guys."
00:25:06,00:25:07,Let's not get too excited.
00:25:07,00:25:08,It's very much the opposite is true
00:25:08,00:25:09,in the actual world.
00:25:09,00:25:10,"Oh, it's pretty..."
00:25:10,00:25:12,What is a lovely tournament.
00:25:12,00:25:13,It's a lovely tournament.
00:25:13,00:25:13,It's been going for years.
00:25:13,00:25:15,"There was a break during the pandemic,"
00:25:15,00:25:17,"and then they had one very recently,"
00:25:17,00:25:19,"and we got to meet the four of us,"
00:25:19,00:25:23,"the captain of the peace team, Dr. Alex Waterman."
00:25:23,00:25:26,And so what's really great is they all represent someone
00:25:26,00:25:28,"who represents war and peace,"
00:25:28,00:25:31,and that's the name that appears on their back.
00:25:31,00:25:33,"For example, the match that happened recently,"
00:25:33,00:25:35,"it was like real nail-biting,"
00:25:35,00:25:36,three to two in the end.
00:25:36,00:25:38,Mother Teresa got a yellow card.
00:25:38,00:25:44,"Yeah, and Martin Luther King made it two-one for peace,"
00:25:44,00:25:45,22 minutes in.
00:25:45,00:25:47,Some controversial choices.
00:25:47,00:25:48,"I mean, Jesus, for instance,"
00:25:48,00:25:49,did he belong on the peace team?
00:25:49,00:25:51,A lot of people would say some wars
00:25:51,00:25:52,are based around Christianity.
00:25:52,00:25:56,"Did Tony Blair belong on the war team, which he was?"
00:25:56,00:25:57,Or did he actually bring peace
00:25:57,00:25:58,to a formerly troubled region?
00:25:58,00:26:01,We're not here to decide.
00:26:01,00:26:06,"Yeah, no, it does sound really cool, as in it's a nice..."
00:26:06,00:26:07,They're both interesting institutions in different ways.
00:26:07,00:26:09,"So the peace department at Bradford,"
00:26:09,00:26:11,"they actually, they have the original studies."
00:26:11,00:26:13,But you know the peace symbol?
00:26:13,00:26:14,"The... Oh, yeah."
00:26:14,00:26:15,The upside down Mercedes with the extra one.
00:26:16,00:26:19,"Yeah, that was designed in 1958"
00:26:19,00:26:20,"and by a guy called Gerald Holtom,"
00:26:20,00:26:21,and they have the originals there.
00:26:21,00:26:23,"Oh, and the anti-nuclear thing."
00:26:23,00:26:25,"Exactly, yeah, really. Very cool."
00:26:25,00:26:26,That's Bradford?
00:26:26,00:26:28,"That's at Bradford, yeah, it's not at the war studies one."
00:26:28,00:26:29,"The war studies one is really interesting, though."
00:26:29,00:26:31,"They do big war game exercises,"
00:26:31,00:26:33,trying to work out what would happen if a war broke out.
00:26:33,00:26:35,"And they actually, I mean, they're kind of on the side of peace."
00:26:35,00:26:37,They're not gunning for it.
00:26:37,00:26:40,"They're trying to avert wars, despite the name."
00:26:40,00:26:41,"But there are a lot of really interesting people there,"
00:26:41,00:26:42,"a lot of spooks as well, actually."
00:26:42,00:26:44,"Oh, really? In Bradford?"
00:26:44,00:26:46,"No, the war studies department."
00:26:46,00:26:51,"Well, let me talk about a real sort of rivalry in sport."
00:26:51,00:26:51,Okay.
00:26:51,00:26:54,Cricket between England and Australia.
00:26:54,00:26:54,Oh.
00:26:54,00:26:57,There was a few interesting things about this.
00:26:57,00:27:01,"After World War II, there were some things called victory tests"
00:27:01,00:27:04,that were held between English and Australian servicemen.
00:27:04,00:27:08,"And there was one Australian bowler called Graham Williams,"
00:27:08,00:27:10,who'd only been released from prisoner of war camp
00:27:10,00:27:12,"a couple of weeks earlier,"
00:27:12,00:27:16,"who was 35 kilograms below his pre-war weight,"
00:27:16,00:27:18,and he had to take glucose tablets throughout the match.
00:27:18,00:27:20,He was given a standing ovation
00:27:20,00:27:21,whenever he did anything on the pitch.
00:27:21,00:27:22,That's incredible.
00:27:22,00:27:25,"And there was a guy called, an Aussie called Keith Miller,"
00:27:25,00:27:28,who's got a century in the first of those tests.
00:27:28,00:27:30,"And when he was asked about the pressure of playing against England,"
00:27:30,00:27:33,"he said, ""Pressure is a mesh of smith up your arse."
00:27:33,00:27:36,"Playing cricket is not."""
00:27:36,00:27:41,"I mean, quickening rivalries are obviously a big thing"
00:27:41,00:27:42,"in both of our respective countries,"
00:27:42,00:27:46,"but university rivalries, which this is, also are everywhere."
00:27:46,00:27:49,And one of the most famous British university rivalries
00:27:49,00:27:51,is a cricket one.
00:27:51,00:27:53,"And it's the annual cricket match between Eaton and Harrow,"
00:27:53,00:27:58,which are just two just very common man schools back in England.
00:27:58,00:28:01,"No, they're two incredibly posh schools,"
00:28:01,00:28:04,and they've been playing the same cricket match at Lord's since 1805.
00:28:04,00:28:06,"Not the same one, they do the same one every year."
00:28:06,00:28:08,"They do go on a while, those cricket matches, don't they?"
00:28:08,00:28:09,They've been playing for a long time.
00:28:09,00:28:12,"Well, it's Test Cricket, so God knows when it's going to finish."
00:28:12,00:28:16,"It's the oldest cricket fixture played at Lord's,"
00:28:16,00:28:17,still played today.
00:28:17,00:28:19,"And I really liked the account of the first one,"
00:28:19,00:28:23,so it was Harrow actually thrashed Eaton in the first one.
00:28:23,00:28:27,But one man you might have heard of who participated was Lord Byron.
00:28:27,00:28:30,"Yes, he did indeed play."
00:28:30,00:28:31,He played for Eaton.
00:28:31,00:28:32,"He went to Eaton, didn't he?"
00:28:32,00:28:33,I think he went to Harrow.
00:28:33,00:28:36,Cool. He played for Harrow.
00:28:36,00:28:36,"Oh, I'm not..."
00:28:36,00:28:38,One of those will be correct.
00:28:38,00:28:38,I think so.
00:28:39,00:28:42,"And so he appeared in the game, but he had a club foot,"
00:28:42,00:28:44,so he needed a runner to run for him.
00:28:44,00:28:47,"He did some batting, and then he had someone else run for him."
00:28:47,00:28:50,"He batted really badly, but it's quite sweet."
00:28:50,00:28:52,"His whole team batted very badly, so actually you're right,"
00:28:52,00:28:54,but he batted for the losing team.
00:28:54,00:28:57,"And he wrote a letter to his brother afterwards,"
00:28:57,00:29:00,"saying that he'd played really well, and it's just quite endearing."
00:29:00,00:29:01,"No, saying that he'd played..."
00:29:01,00:29:04,"He said, ""Look, our team did dreadfully awfully,"
00:29:04,00:29:08,"but I, you know, comported myself quite impressively"
00:29:08,00:29:11,"by comparison, and only batted the third best of everyone,"
00:29:11,00:29:14,"which still meant he only scored about six runs."""
00:29:14,00:29:18,"But it's just so sweet knowing him as this great ego,"
00:29:18,00:29:20,"desperately trying to say, ""I'm good at cricket."""
00:29:20,00:29:23,"And then he said, ""Later, to be sure, we were most of us"
00:29:23,00:29:25,"very drunk and went together to the Haymarket Theatre,"
00:29:25,00:29:28,"where we kicked up a row, as you may suppose,"
00:29:28,00:29:31,"when so many Herovians and Atonians meet in one place."""
00:29:31,00:29:31,Wow.
00:29:31,00:29:32,Which plews that change.
00:29:32,00:29:35,"Speaking quite similarly, actually, kind of similarly."
00:29:35,00:29:39,"In 1908, the Aussie Rules League in Australia"
00:29:39,00:29:42,"had a team from Melbourne University join the league,"
00:29:42,00:29:44,and everyone else at the time was amateur.
00:29:44,00:29:45,They were all workers.
00:29:45,00:29:47,"But this team from Melbourne University,"
00:29:47,00:29:49,you could only play for them if you'd matriculated
00:29:49,00:29:51,or if you had a higher-class degree.
00:29:51,00:29:53,"Otherwise, you weren't allowed to play for the team."
00:29:53,00:29:56,And they left the league in 1916
00:29:56,00:29:58,after losing 51 games in a row.
00:29:58,00:30:00,[LAUGHTER]
00:30:00,00:30:01,"Yeah, it is."
00:30:01,00:30:02,That's superb.
00:30:03,00:30:07,"Australia has quite a lot of great rivalries, I think."
00:30:07,00:30:10,"Not just with other places, but also internal ones."
00:30:10,00:30:12,"So, for example, which is better to live?"
00:30:12,00:30:13,Sydney or Melbourne?
00:30:13,00:30:15,"See, it's very mixed."
00:30:15,00:30:18,Canberra!
00:30:18,00:30:23,"Well, you know, 40% of Australia's population"
00:30:23,00:30:24,live in one of those two cities.
00:30:24,00:30:25,Right.
00:30:25,00:30:27,"And obviously, neither have you got to be the capital."
00:30:27,00:30:32,But the rivalries are very tight on either side.
00:30:32,00:30:34,"So, for example, Sydney has been named"
00:30:34,00:30:36,the world's best city eight consecutive times
00:30:36,00:30:37,by Condé Nast Traveller.
00:30:37,00:30:38,"Oh, yeah."
00:30:38,00:30:38,Pretty good.
00:30:38,00:30:42,But Melbourne has been named the world's most liveable city
00:30:42,00:30:44,seven times by the Economist.
00:30:44,00:30:47,"So, is it rather to live in the best city"
00:30:47,00:30:48,or the most liveable one?
00:30:48,00:30:49,Let's ask the room.
00:30:49,00:30:51,Which one would you rather?
00:30:51,00:30:54,"I regret... Sorry, the room is curdling like milk"
00:30:54,00:30:55,as I'm reading this stuff out.
00:30:55,00:30:56,[LAUGHTER]
00:30:56,00:30:58,"So, can I tell you about a pumpkin growing thing?"
00:30:58,00:30:58,"Yes, please."
00:30:58,00:30:59,Thank you.
00:30:59,00:31:00,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:00,00:31:02,Which city is best at great pumpkins?
00:31:02,00:31:05,Sydney.
00:31:05,00:31:05,Sydney.
00:31:05,00:31:06,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:06,00:31:08,"The great Australian rivalry, number one,"
00:31:08,00:31:11,is the Atlantic Giant Pumpkin Growing Championship.
00:31:11,00:31:12,"Oh, yeah."
00:31:12,00:31:12,This is amazing.
00:31:12,00:31:14,"The two guys called Gary Smith and Dale Oliver,"
00:31:14,00:31:16,and they try and grow heavier pumpkins than each other.
00:31:16,00:31:19,The Australian record is 743 kilos.
00:31:19,00:31:22,"For a pumpkin, but they're very..."
00:31:22,00:31:24,"Nicely, they are sort of trying to beat each other,"
00:31:24,00:31:25,but they're also very relaxed.
00:31:25,00:31:27,"So, Dale Oliver was asked,"
00:31:27,00:31:29,"""What about Gary Smith, this guy who's trying to beat you?"""
00:31:29,00:31:31,"And he replied, ""Well, I hope he does."
00:31:31,00:31:33,"He puts a lot of effort in, so that would be great."""
00:31:33,00:31:34,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:34,00:31:34,"Oh, that's nice."
00:31:34,00:31:36,"That was actually a tie, though."
00:31:36,00:31:36,"It was, ""I hope he dies."""
00:31:36,00:31:41,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:41,00:31:45,I think we can't talk about rivalry
00:31:45,00:31:48,without talking about the longest-term rivalry of all time.
00:31:48,00:31:50,"And it's just so epic, blues versus greens."
00:31:50,00:31:52,I don't think we talk about it enough.
00:31:52,00:31:56,"Ancient Rome, blues versus greens, went on for 400 years."
00:31:56,00:31:57,What do you mean? What's that?
00:31:57,00:31:59,"So, they were the two sports teams, basically."
00:31:59,00:32:00,They were the chariot racers.
00:32:00,00:32:02,They were split into four teams.
00:32:02,00:32:04,"Originally, it was reds, whites, greens, and blues."
00:32:04,00:32:07,"And then, eventually, it became blues and greens,"
00:32:07,00:32:09,"and reds and whites joined one each, respectively."
00:32:09,00:32:11,And they were fanatical.
00:32:11,00:32:14,And it really reached its climax
00:32:14,00:32:17,"by about the 6th century, when it was the Byzantine Empire."
00:32:17,00:32:19,"And it was things like, you know,"
00:32:19,00:32:20,that you'd be in a big stadium
00:32:20,00:32:23,"and 3,000 people would be massacred"
00:32:23,00:32:26,"as a result of this just, like, hot-headed rivalry."
00:32:26,00:32:27,"And it wasn't about chariot racing anymore,"
00:32:27,00:32:30,much like football rivalries or sports rivalries today.
00:32:30,00:32:33,It was just kind of people who were either blue or green
00:32:33,00:32:35,running and beating each other up.
00:32:35,00:32:38,"And this epic moment in early Byzantine history,"
00:32:38,00:32:43,"the Niko riots, happened because of this weird sports rivalry,"
00:32:43,00:32:45,"which was, it was the most violent disturbance"
00:32:45,00:32:47,in Constantinople's history.
00:32:47,00:32:50,It was the year 532.
00:32:50,00:32:52,There was a massive fight between blues and greens.
00:32:52,00:32:56,"And the emperor was like, you're all, you're all detentioned."
00:32:56,00:32:58,"You know, you're all doing lines."
00:32:58,00:33:00,I'm punishing you all.
00:33:00,00:33:02,The leaders of both of you are being executed.
00:33:02,00:33:04,"Come along with me, get executed."
00:33:04,00:33:06,Two of the executions were botched.
00:33:06,00:33:09,But it was one from the blues and one from the greenside.
00:33:09,00:33:12,So that was a lovely coming together moment.
00:33:12,00:33:17,"Because they were both like, oh, you've botched our executions."
00:33:17,00:33:19,"And everyone was like, oh, well, let them go."
00:33:19,00:33:20,You fucked up their executions.
00:33:20,00:33:21,"You know, just let them free."
00:33:21,00:33:23,How do you mess up an execution in nature?
00:33:23,00:33:26,"Oh, it's a lot more complicated than the scaffold broke."
00:33:26,00:33:28,"Oh, yeah, that'll do."
00:33:28,00:33:29,It's a project management problem.
00:33:29,00:33:31,"OK, yeah, yeah, sorry."
00:33:31,00:33:33,I'm sure a carpenter was fired.
00:33:33,00:33:33,"Yeah, yeah."
00:33:33,00:33:36,But there were still battles between the blues and the greens
00:33:36,00:33:38,"and the whites and the reds, right?"
00:33:38,00:33:41,"The Calcio Fiorentino tournament still goes on,"
00:33:41,00:33:47,"which is like, it's like soccer/rugby/ lots of different sports."
00:33:47,00:33:48,And they play in Italy.
00:33:48,00:33:51,"And it's very, very, very violent."
00:33:51,00:33:54,"There was a guy called Mirko Cardelli,"
00:33:54,00:33:56,"who broke both his hands during the game,"
00:33:56,00:33:59,but carried on playing and complained afterwards
00:33:59,00:34:02,that the main problem was he couldn't urinate properly for weeks.
00:34:02,00:34:03,Right.
00:34:03,00:34:03,What?
00:34:03,00:34:05,Because his hands were broken.
00:34:05,00:34:07,I think it meant he couldn't hold his.
00:34:07,00:34:09,Not that he was urinated through his fingers.
00:34:09,00:34:13,"And they brought in new rules about maybe about 10 years ago,"
00:34:13,00:34:18,saying that convicted criminals are not allowed to play in the tournament.
00:34:18,00:34:21,And the green team lost 20 players due to that rule.
00:34:21,00:34:21,No.
00:34:22,00:34:25,"Is it a descendant of the Byzantine one, do we think?"
00:34:25,00:34:26,Not really.
00:34:26,00:34:30,"The Calcio's only got, well, it goes back to about the 13th century."
00:34:30,00:34:31,"Wait, and not two."
00:34:31,00:34:34,Because this one actually did end in them being wiped out
00:34:34,00:34:35,during this botched execution thing.
00:34:35,00:34:39,"30,000 people died, 10% of the population of the city killed,"
00:34:39,00:34:40,because they got together and rose up against the emperor.
00:34:40,00:34:43,"They were like, hang on, I bet we're better together."
00:34:43,00:34:46,Do you know why we are rivals with each other?
00:34:46,00:34:47,"Us, here, today, we're not."
00:34:47,00:34:49,"We're all on the same team, Andy."
00:34:49,00:34:51,"Okay, that's, that's loser talk."
00:34:52,00:34:52,Wow.
00:34:52,00:34:56,"Is, what is it, not like a sexual selection thing?"
00:34:56,00:34:57,Oh.
00:34:57,00:34:59,Not tonight.
00:34:59,00:35:02,And we sexually selected each other.
00:35:02,00:35:03,Wow.
00:35:03,00:35:05,"There is, I just, I like the..."
00:35:05,00:35:07,"You know, sometimes you forget there's two and a half thousand people in the room."
00:35:07,00:35:11,"I'm just thinking, how is it possible for three people"
00:35:11,00:35:13,to have lost this competition between three people?
00:35:13,00:35:13,But go on.
00:35:13,00:35:16,"Why are we rivals, Andy?"
00:35:16,00:35:20,"There's a theory that is from the Unheimlich,"
00:35:20,00:35:22,"which is the German for the Uncanny, right?"
00:35:22,00:35:24,"So Freud had this theory that the rival,"
00:35:24,00:35:27,it's a double who reveals uncomfortable truths about ourselves.
00:35:27,00:35:30,You sort of see yourself reflected in them.
00:35:30,00:35:31,You know what I mean?
00:35:31,00:35:32,"You see the similarities between you,"
00:35:32,00:35:36,"which creates a sense of, you know, unhappiness and unease within you."
00:35:36,00:35:38,"Therefore, you react with kind of hostility and aggression."
00:35:38,00:35:40,"You know, like those bastards in Melbourne, whatever."
00:35:40,00:35:45,"That's the principle, like you hate and you undermine them."
00:35:45,00:35:46,I must be the true one.
00:35:46,00:35:48,"It can't be these guys, because they're so similar to me that I find them."
00:35:48,00:35:49,"Yeah, yeah."
00:35:49,00:35:50,Which I quite like.
00:35:50,00:35:54,"I just think that word is too close to Heimlich,"
00:35:54,00:35:56,"which is a very important manoeuvre,"
00:35:56,00:35:58,"which I don't want anyone in a restaurant going,"
00:35:58,00:35:59,"""Does anyone know the Heimlich?"""
00:35:59,00:36:01,"And you getting up going, ""Ah, the Unheimlich?"""
00:36:01,00:36:03,"Yes, it is a..."
00:36:03,00:36:06,The Unheimlich manoeuvre is when you put more things inside their mouth.
00:36:06,00:36:17,"It is time for our final fact, and that is Andy."
00:36:17,00:36:19,My fact is that Spanish people have no way
00:36:19,00:36:22,of telling the afternoon from the evening.
00:36:22,00:36:24,Come on.
00:36:24,00:36:25,It can't be done.
00:36:25,00:36:28,"Well, until now, because we're here to tell them, Spain,"
00:36:28,00:36:30,"is when it gets a little bit darker, a bit more difficult to see."
00:36:30,00:36:31,End of fact.
00:36:31,00:36:32,There you go.
00:36:32,00:36:34,What the hell are you talking about?
00:36:34,00:36:35,You are from La Spana.
00:36:35,00:36:36,This is great.
00:36:36,00:36:36,This is...
00:36:36,00:36:38,"OK, so this is based on a brilliant piece"
00:36:38,00:36:41,that was in the Financial Times by Barney Jobs and Kudos to him.
00:36:41,00:36:43,"So there is a word, ""latarde"", right?"
00:36:43,00:36:44,Afternoon.
00:36:44,00:36:45,What's the word for the evening?
00:36:45,00:36:47,Latarde.
00:36:47,00:36:48,Uh-oh.
00:36:48,00:36:48,Yeah.
00:36:48,00:36:50,"So ""tarde"" is, as far as I can gather,"
00:36:50,00:36:53,"either from soon after 12, not actually at 12,"
00:36:53,00:36:56,"it's either soon after 12 or potentially from 4pm, right?"
00:36:56,00:36:58,So there's a gap.
00:36:58,00:37:00,"But if you have lunch at 4pm or maybe 5pm,"
00:37:00,00:37:03,"which is very common, it's not ""latarde"" until 5 o'clock."
00:37:03,00:37:05,And then you go back to work at 6 o'clock.
00:37:05,00:37:08,"But if you say ""buenas noches"" to someone before 11pm,"
00:37:08,00:37:10,they'll look at you like you're insane.
00:37:10,00:37:10,Yeah.
00:37:10,00:37:13,"They'll say, ""That's sort of an ultimate faux pas."""
00:37:13,00:37:14,It's like calling your teacher mum.
00:37:14,00:37:16,It's just so embarrassing.
00:37:17,00:37:22,So does the whole country grind to a halt every single day?
00:37:22,00:37:26,"Well, it's not for me to say what's grinding to a halt or not."
00:37:26,00:37:30,Or are they just able to tell everything by context?
00:37:30,00:37:31,Why do we need to tell?
00:37:31,00:37:33,"The question I found myself asking is when you mentioned this,"
00:37:33,00:37:35,"""Why in earth do we need to?"""
00:37:35,00:37:37,"You know, it's afternoon and it's pre-noon."
00:37:37,00:37:38,That's there.
00:37:38,00:37:40,"I spoke to my brother-in-law, who is Spanish,"
00:37:40,00:37:41,and that is exactly his attitude.
00:37:41,00:37:44,"And I was like, ""No, but then say it's like you're reading a novel."""
00:37:44,00:37:45,And they say these words.
00:37:45,00:37:46,"""How do you know?"""
00:37:46,00:37:47,"And he went, ""We know."""
00:37:47,00:37:50,They just know.
00:37:50,00:37:50,I know.
00:37:50,00:37:53,It's quite baffling as a non-Spanish speaker
00:37:53,00:37:54,to try and get your head around this.
00:37:54,00:37:56,But I think it creates problems.
00:37:56,00:37:57,Because when do you have your tea?
00:37:57,00:37:58,When do you have your afternoon tea?
00:37:58,00:38:01,What if you have it at 7pm by mistake?
00:38:01,00:38:02,You screwed up.
00:38:02,00:38:02,Disaster.
00:38:02,00:38:03,They won't.
00:38:03,00:38:04,Because they know.
00:38:04,00:38:05,I know.
00:38:05,00:38:08,But Spain has really mixed up about time in general.
00:38:08,00:38:10,So Spain is on the wrong time zone.
00:38:10,00:38:11,I think we've mentioned before.
00:38:11,00:38:16,"But in about 1940, General Franco was trying to kiss up"
00:38:16,00:38:19,to Nazi Germany and set Spanish time pegadit to Germany.
00:38:19,00:38:21,"And that means that for half a year,"
00:38:21,00:38:24,they're on the same time as the very eastern edge of Germany.
00:38:24,00:38:26,"The other half, they're like halfway across Ukraine,"
00:38:26,00:38:29,is where the sunshine and midday matches the clock.
00:38:29,00:38:31,So everyone is completely out of work.
00:38:31,00:38:33,They don't have a random bit of the country
00:38:33,00:38:35,"that's half an hour different than everywhere else, do they?"
00:38:35,00:38:37,"No, that would be insane."
00:38:40,00:38:43,I think I read something that said it probably has a lot to do
00:38:43,00:38:45,with the fact that it's lighter a lot more often.
00:38:45,00:38:48,And it stays light later.
00:38:48,00:38:49,And it's the same in Arabic.
00:38:49,00:38:51,You don't really distinguish between afternoon and evening
00:38:51,00:38:51,in the same way.
00:38:51,00:38:54,"You have the specific prayer times,"
00:38:54,00:38:56,which refer to five specific times a day.
00:38:56,00:38:59,But you basically have something that means good afternoon
00:38:59,00:39:00,and something that means good night.
00:39:00,00:39:03,"And that's, I guess, it's light."
00:39:03,00:39:06,"And maybe because in the UK, because it gets dark much earlier,"
00:39:06,00:39:09,you know basically whether it's the afternoon or the evening.
00:39:09,00:39:11,So Spanish people get very annoyed if you suggest
00:39:11,00:39:12,they all have a siesta for three hours a day
00:39:12,00:39:14,"because they actually, they really don't."
00:39:14,00:39:16,"Yeah, I think only about 20% of them do these days, don't you?"
00:39:16,00:39:17,"Yeah, and it's much shorter."
00:39:17,00:39:20,But the problem is that the workday goes from 9 a.m. till about 8 p.m.
00:39:20,00:39:24,They're like some of the longest workers in Europe by hours.
00:39:24,00:39:26,And the good TV doesn't start until 10 p.m.
00:39:26,00:39:30,A children's TV sometimes doesn't start until 9.30 p.m.
00:39:30,00:39:30,Really?
00:39:30,00:39:32,"Children's TV, yeah."
00:39:32,00:39:33,"Okay, this is the maddest thing I've found."
00:39:33,00:39:38,"In 2017, in Spain, MasterChef Junior ended at one in the morning."
00:39:38,00:39:40,(LAUGHTER)
00:39:40,00:39:42,"And like MPs complained about it and said,"
00:39:42,00:39:46,"""Could they possibly turn off the children's TV by 11 p.m.?"""
00:39:46,00:39:47,Everyone is under-slept.
00:39:47,00:39:49,"Yeah, amazing, yeah."
00:39:49,00:39:50,"My brother-in-law, he keeps telling me"
00:39:50,00:39:53,that Spanish is the superior language
00:39:53,00:39:56,whenever we're talking about our respective first languages.
00:39:56,00:39:57,And...
00:39:57,00:39:59,"Well, I mean, compared to your language, yes, Dan,"
00:39:59,00:40:03,but he should compare Spanish to English one of these days.
00:40:03,00:40:05,"Okay, I mean, the language I speak is Australian,"
00:40:05,00:40:09,"so that's a bold little statement there, mate."
00:40:09,00:40:10,(LAUGHTER)
00:40:10,00:40:12,"But I don't know, do we have Spanish speakers in the crowd?"
00:40:12,00:40:14,"Okay, a few, right?"
00:40:14,00:40:18,"Because while hunting, it's so hard to tell sometimes"
00:40:18,00:40:20,whether a translation is a bit too wild or not.
00:40:20,00:40:23,"But so, for example, I read that the Spanish"
00:40:23,00:40:26,"don't have a distinct word for toes, for the feet, right?"
00:40:26,00:40:27,Feel toes.
00:40:27,00:40:28,Yeah.
00:40:28,00:40:31,"They call them des dos des los pies,"
00:40:31,00:40:33,"which means ""the fingers of the feet."""
00:40:33,00:40:35,(LAUGHTER)
00:40:35,00:40:36,Makes sense.
00:40:36,00:40:39,You know how we always say you have three-toed sloth
00:40:39,00:40:41,and a two-toed sloth?
00:40:41,00:40:41,"Yeah, yes."
00:40:41,00:40:44,"But actually, they all have the same number of toes,"
00:40:44,00:40:46,but they have a different number of fingers.
00:40:46,00:40:47,"Oh, wow, yeah."
00:40:47,00:40:51,But the problem is that it all came from a Spanish translation
00:40:51,00:40:53,where they called everything fingers.
00:40:53,00:40:55,"Ah, so it's a three-fingered sloth,"
00:40:55,00:40:58,and we assumed it was three-finger-of-the-footed sloth.
00:40:58,00:40:59,Exactly.
00:40:59,00:41:00,But it's just three-fingered sloth.
00:41:00,00:41:01,So it can be a problem.
00:41:01,00:41:04,"Yeah, how big a problem has that been?"
00:41:04,00:41:06,"The sloth world, honestly."
00:41:06,00:41:07,It's ground to a halt every afternoon.
00:41:07,00:41:09,(LAUGHTER)
00:41:09,00:41:12,An amazing language thing relating to day times
00:41:12,00:41:13,between Spanish and English.
00:41:13,00:41:16,"I've always loved the English word ""day"""
00:41:16,00:41:18,"and the Spanish word ""dea."""
00:41:18,00:41:20,"You know, they're completely unrelated to each other."
00:41:20,00:41:21,Really?
00:41:21,00:41:22,Isn't that so cool?
00:41:22,00:41:23,Okay.
00:41:23,00:41:24,"The Spanish is from Latin, D.A.'s,"
00:41:24,00:41:26,which all the other Romance languages are.
00:41:26,00:41:28,Our day has absolutely nothing to do with that.
00:41:28,00:41:30,So there's come some heavenly sky.
00:41:30,00:41:32,"You know, it's right to the lightness of the sky,"
00:41:32,00:41:35,"which is why it's quite similar to Deus, God."
00:41:35,00:41:38,"Whereas the English word comes from Old English, ""dague."""
00:41:38,00:41:39,Nothing to do with Latin.
00:41:39,00:41:40,Isn't that so cool?
00:41:40,00:41:41,That's weird.
00:41:41,00:41:41,That's weird.
00:41:41,00:41:42,That's very cool.
00:41:42,00:41:46,"In Spanish, they use reflexive verbs quite a lot."
00:41:46,00:41:48,"So if I knock over this water,"
00:41:48,00:41:51,you might say James knocked over the water.
00:41:51,00:41:53,"But in Spanish, you would say the water"
00:41:53,00:41:55,knocked over itself by James.
00:41:55,00:41:57,(LAUGHTER)
00:41:57,00:41:59,"And, Dan, your brother-in-law says this is a superior language."
00:41:59,00:42:01,"That's what I'm talking about, right?"
00:42:01,00:42:05,But what actually means is when you show someone from Spain
00:42:05,00:42:08,"like a drawing of something that's happened,"
00:42:08,00:42:09,like there's a vase on the floor
00:42:09,00:42:11,and there's one person looking guilty
00:42:11,00:42:12,"and one person not looking guilty,"
00:42:12,00:42:14,they find it more difficult to work out
00:42:14,00:42:17,who knocked over the vase than English people.
00:42:17,00:42:18,"Because as far as they're concerned,"
00:42:18,00:42:19,the vase broke itself.
00:42:19,00:42:21,(LAUGHTER)
00:42:21,00:42:22,"And they can still do it,"
00:42:22,00:42:24,but it just takes the brain a bit longer to process.
00:42:24,00:42:26,That's so interesting.
00:42:26,00:42:27,Does it also mean murder mysteries
00:42:27,00:42:28,or a little bit more exciting?
00:42:28,00:42:30,Because there's the waiting.
00:42:30,00:42:32,He was killed by...
00:42:32,00:42:33,"Dun, dun, dun."
00:42:33,00:42:35,"Whereas we just go, ""Oh, Barry killed him."""
00:42:35,00:42:37,"Like, ""Where's the suspense there?"""
00:42:37,00:42:41,But there's a thing about how the Spanish speakers
00:42:41,00:42:42,"and English speakers think about time,"
00:42:42,00:42:43,which is just the same.
00:42:43,00:42:45,You get a different conceptual universe
00:42:45,00:42:46,by the way your language is shaped.
00:42:46,00:42:49,So English speakers think of time as a length.
00:42:49,00:42:51,"It was a long time, right?"
00:42:51,00:42:51,"Oh, OK."
00:42:51,00:42:53,It does a length stretching out.
00:42:53,00:42:54,"It's centimetres, you know?"
00:42:54,00:42:55,"It's a sausage, right?"
00:42:55,00:42:55,Spanish speakers...
00:42:55,00:42:57,(LAUGHTER)
00:42:57,00:42:59,"Everything comes down to sausages with you, doesn't it, Andy?"
00:42:59,00:43:02,"In Spain, it's a volume."
00:43:02,00:43:03,It's a swelling.
00:43:03,00:43:04,It's a...
00:43:04,00:43:05,"Again, a sausage."
00:43:05,00:43:08,(LAUGHTER)
00:43:08,00:43:12,"It's an orb sausage, if I could put it that way."
00:43:12,00:43:13,"Yeah, like a haggis."
00:43:13,00:43:15,It's a constantly growing haggis.
00:43:15,00:43:16,That's right.
00:43:16,00:43:16,"Oh, yeah."
00:43:16,00:43:18,So does that change things?
00:43:18,00:43:19,"Maybe, a bit."
00:43:19,00:43:20,(LAUGHTER)
00:43:20,00:43:20,Yeah.
00:43:20,00:43:23,It's funny when you get to...
00:43:23,00:43:24,"Like, when I talk to my brother-in-law"
00:43:24,00:43:27,"about his impressions of English,"
00:43:27,00:43:28,"you know, we could equally be doing a fact"
00:43:28,00:43:30,"about how weird our language is, right?"
00:43:30,00:43:30,"Oh, yeah."
00:43:30,00:43:31,"One of the first things is,"
00:43:31,00:43:34,"when he started dating my sister-in-law,"
00:43:34,00:43:35,"and they eventually got married,"
00:43:35,00:43:37,there was a bit of religion going on at the time.
00:43:37,00:43:39,They used to go to church a lot.
00:43:39,00:43:42,His impression of how we generally spoke to each other
00:43:42,00:43:46,was to speak in a voice like this.
00:43:46,00:43:47,(LAUGHTER)
00:43:47,00:43:50,"And so, that just used to be a thing at the dinner table."
00:43:50,00:43:52,Can you pass me those old Daniel?
00:43:52,00:43:54,(LAUGHTER)
00:43:54,00:43:54,He just thought that was...
00:43:54,00:43:55,Why?
00:43:55,00:43:56,"Wait, because he's..."
00:43:56,00:43:57,He just thought it was a beautiful invention.
00:43:57,00:44:00,"No, because he just used to hear the beaches."
00:44:00,00:44:01,I see.
00:44:01,00:44:03,So does that mean when he heard you
00:44:03,00:44:05,"and he didn't really know what he was hearing,"
00:44:05,00:44:07,that's just the sound that made in his head?
00:44:07,00:44:10,"Yeah, he was trying to adopt certain accents"
00:44:10,00:44:11,in ways that were spoken.
00:44:11,00:44:13,"And the same way that if you were speaking Spanish,"
00:44:13,00:44:15,you might put on a slightly racist Spanish accent.
00:44:15,00:44:16,(LAUGHTER)
00:44:16,00:44:20,"Now, I know you're referring to a previous episode"
00:44:20,00:44:22,in which I tried to explain that I find their lisp
00:44:22,00:44:25,"very sexy, that sort of..."
00:44:25,00:44:26,"Oh, yeah."
00:44:26,00:44:27,(SPEAKING SPANISH)
00:44:27,00:44:28,That kind of...
00:44:28,00:44:31,"Because it's not a speech impediment,"
00:44:31,00:44:33,it's a thing that they purposefully
00:44:33,00:44:34,"have trained their language to be, right?"
00:44:34,00:44:35,Yeah.
00:44:35,00:44:36,(SPEAKING SPANISH)
00:44:36,00:44:40,"Okay, I think it's important that we move on."
00:44:40,00:44:41,Can I teach you some Spanish?
00:44:41,00:44:42,"Yeah, sure."
00:44:42,00:44:43,Okay.
00:44:43,00:44:45,"Can you spell the word ""sox"" in English?"
00:44:45,00:44:47,S-O-C-K-S.
00:44:47,00:44:49,S-O-C-K-S is Spanish for...
00:44:49,00:44:50,That's really what it is.
00:44:50,00:44:50,No.
00:44:50,00:44:52,S-O-C-K-S.
00:44:52,00:44:53,"Oh, really?"
00:44:53,00:44:55,S-O-C-K-S.
00:44:55,00:44:57,These are really cool.
00:44:57,00:44:58,Can I just...
00:44:58,00:44:59,"I don't think that's racist, right?"
00:44:59,00:45:02,"Like, that is the thing that they've built into the language."
00:45:02,00:45:02,Am I cool with this?
00:45:02,00:45:04,Are we all right?
00:45:04,00:45:05,It's really racist!
00:45:05,00:45:06,I'm going to stop it.
00:45:06,00:45:08,I'm going to stop it.
00:45:08,00:45:08,I'm going to...
00:45:08,00:45:09,"Okay, let's try this one then."
00:45:09,00:45:10,I'm going to apologize.
00:45:10,00:45:13,"Um, say I meant to kill you,"
00:45:13,00:45:16,but in a slightly Irish accent.
00:45:16,00:45:16,Nope.
00:45:16,00:45:17,Or you meant...
00:45:17,00:45:18,I'll do it.
00:45:18,00:45:19,I'll say this one.
00:45:19,00:45:20,Let's try that one.
00:45:20,00:45:20,No way.
00:45:20,00:45:22,Irish or Northern Irish?
00:45:22,00:45:23,"Ah, Republic."
00:45:23,00:45:24,Or you meant to kill you?
00:45:24,00:45:24,"Oh, do it, do it, do it, do it."
00:45:24,00:45:26,"Oh, you meant to kill you."
00:45:26,00:45:28,"Oh, you meant to kill you."
00:45:28,00:45:31,"Well, I meant to kill you is the butter in Spanish."
00:45:31,00:45:32,"Oh, you meant to kill you?"
00:45:32,00:45:32,Yeah.
00:45:32,00:45:33,"Oh, you meant to kill you."
00:45:33,00:45:34,How does it break down?
00:45:34,00:45:35,"Oh, I'm..."
00:45:35,00:45:35,What?
00:45:35,00:45:37,Why do you think so full-fledged about it?
00:45:37,00:45:40,"Oh, I've only ever heard them when they sing in choirs."
00:45:40,00:45:45,I meant to kill you.
00:45:45,00:45:49,"Um, just two more of those."
00:45:49,00:45:52,Fireman Derrick sounds like thank you in Albanian.
00:45:52,00:45:53,Say it again?
00:45:53,00:45:54,Fireman Derrick.
00:45:54,00:45:54,Fireman Derrick.
00:45:54,00:45:55,Fireman Derrick.
00:45:55,00:45:58,"Yeah, and 12 months in Estonian sounds exactly the same"
00:45:58,00:46:00,as cox tastes good.
00:46:00,00:46:03,Gladly.
00:46:03,00:46:07,"There's one word in Spanish that can be spoken,"
00:46:07,00:46:09,but that cannot be written down.
00:46:09,00:46:10,Oh.
00:46:10,00:46:13,"And this has been stated by the Royal Spanish Academy,"
00:46:13,00:46:16,"which is, you know, the French has the Académie Française,"
00:46:16,00:46:17,which monitors their language.
00:46:17,00:46:18,"Spain has exactly the same thing,"
00:46:18,00:46:21,which monitors the Spanish language
00:46:21,00:46:25,made up of immortals who tell you what the rules are.
00:46:25,00:46:27,"And there's this word, which I find fascinating,"
00:46:27,00:46:31,"and it's the word that means, uh, get out,"
00:46:31,00:46:33,"and you like get out to him or get out to her,"
00:46:33,00:46:35,"you know, get out to him and help him out."
00:46:35,00:46:37,"It is not super common, but it is used a fair bit,"
00:46:37,00:46:41,"and it's written S-A-L-L-E, or it should be."
00:46:41,00:46:44,"But if you pronounce that, you'd say say yeah,"
00:46:44,00:46:46,but it's actually pronounced when people say it.
00:46:46,00:46:48,S-O-L-L-E.
00:46:48,00:46:49,"And it's incredibly confusing,"
00:46:49,00:46:51,"and the Royal Spanish Academy have said,"
00:46:51,00:46:54,"""Because this word has no spelling"
00:46:54,00:46:56,"that matches the way we say it,"
00:46:56,00:46:58,"this word is not allowed to be written down."""
00:46:58,00:47:02,"So this is the one word you can say S-O-L-L-E,"
00:47:02,00:47:04,"but there is no correct way to spell it,"
00:47:04,00:47:06,"and it suggests if you do want to write it down,"
00:47:06,00:47:08,find an alternative.
00:47:08,00:47:08,They're crazy.
00:47:08,00:47:09,Right.
00:47:09,00:47:11,"They are so, they're so hardcore."
00:47:11,00:47:12,"I love, I love the Royal Spanish Academy."
00:47:12,00:47:13,I think they're brilliant.
00:47:13,00:47:14,"So they, in a few years ago,"
00:47:14,00:47:17,they printed an 800-page guide to the proper use of Spanish.
00:47:17,00:47:19,"Like, they really care."
00:47:19,00:47:21,"Last year, only last year,"
00:47:21,00:47:24,"they finished a 13-year battle over the use of the word ""solo"""
00:47:24,00:47:28,and whether it should have an acute accent over the first O.
00:47:28,00:47:28,Okay?
00:47:28,00:47:32,That was a 13-year struggle in Spanish linguistics.
00:47:32,00:47:32,Right.
00:47:32,00:47:34,And I think they concluded no.
00:47:34,00:47:38,No acute accent over the first O in solo.
00:47:38,00:47:41,"But a very famous Spanish author called Arturo Perez-Riverte,"
00:47:41,00:47:46,"he declared, ""I will put solo with an accent until the cold of the grave."""
00:47:46,00:47:48,Wow.
00:47:48,00:47:49,People care.
00:47:49,00:47:49,They do.
00:47:49,00:47:53,"Which he has met prematurely and mysteriously now, hasn't he?"
00:47:53,00:47:56,A huge acute accent sticking out.
00:47:56,00:48:00,They're great.
00:48:00,00:48:01,Can I tell you guys a quick thing?
00:48:01,00:48:03,"I've just suddenly remembered speaking of my brother-in-law,"
00:48:03,00:48:05,so he's Spanish.
00:48:05,00:48:06,They...
00:48:06,00:48:06,Is he Spanish?
00:48:06,00:48:07,Yeah.
00:48:07,00:48:07,Wow.
00:48:07,00:48:07,Yeah.
00:48:07,00:48:10,"So he got married in Spain,"
00:48:10,00:48:14,"and two nights before he got married, he decided to throw a stag do."
00:48:14,00:48:16,"And so I was invited to the stag do,"
00:48:16,00:48:19,"and it was him and all his Spanish friends and me,"
00:48:19,00:48:21,who speaks no Spanish whatsoever.
00:48:21,00:48:21,Wow.
00:48:21,00:48:25,"So we went to this bar, and my soon-to-be-wife Fenella,"
00:48:25,00:48:28,"and I should say what I'm about to say next,"
00:48:28,00:48:30,put the whole idea of marriage and jeopardy.
00:48:30,00:48:34,"She and her family went home and we stayed out,"
00:48:34,00:48:35,"and we were having one more drink,"
00:48:35,00:48:36,"and just before we were going,"
00:48:36,00:48:37,"one of the bartenders spoke Spanish,"
00:48:37,00:48:38,"I didn't understand anything,"
00:48:39,00:48:43,"but slammed a drink down as a courtesy bottle for us to have for free,"
00:48:43,00:48:44,and it was called Thunder Bitch.
00:48:44,00:48:45,And...
00:48:45,00:48:48,"Sorry, is that Thunder Bitch,"
00:48:48,00:48:49,but you're doing the sexy accent.
00:48:49,00:48:54,"Yeah, it was called Thunder Bitch,"
00:48:54,00:48:57,"and that is all I remember from the end of the evening, right?"
00:48:57,00:49:01,"I woke up, I woke up in a hut, in a farm,"
00:49:01,00:49:04,"with a man holding a bowl of paella over me,"
00:49:04,00:49:06,"going, ""Eat up!"""
00:49:06,00:49:08,"And I was like, ""Where am I?"""
00:49:09,00:49:10,"Fortunately, the groom was there as well."
00:49:10,00:49:11,I called my wife.
00:49:11,00:49:13,"She's like, ""Where the fuck are you?"
00:49:13,00:49:16,"We're in rural Spain, and you've disappeared."""
00:49:16,00:49:17,"So I thought, and I was like,"
00:49:17,00:49:18,"""Oh, I was trying to look after him,"
00:49:18,00:49:20,"but I had no memory of the night."""
00:49:20,00:49:23,"So two days later, we went back to that bar,"
00:49:23,00:49:24,"and I thought, ""This will be fine,"
00:49:24,00:49:27,because we couldn't speak to each other.
00:49:27,00:49:28,"There's no chat that would have happened, right?"""
00:49:28,00:49:32,"I get to the bar, and I've told her that I've had a very casual night."
00:49:32,00:49:34,"We walk up and we say,"
00:49:34,00:49:37,"""Hi, can we get a couple of glasses of wine?"""
00:49:37,00:49:41,"And the bartender looks at me and goes, ""Oh, my God, crazy, Dan is back?"""
00:49:41,00:49:45,"And he went to everyone,"
00:49:45,00:49:47,"""Guys, crazy party, Dan is back!"""
00:49:47,00:49:51,"And they were like, ""You were amazing."
00:49:51,00:49:53,"You were on all the tops of the bars dancing."""
00:49:53,00:49:55,"And Fradella was like, ""You fucking what?"""
00:49:55,00:50:00,I can't believe a conversation
00:50:00,00:50:02,about the intricacies of the beautiful Spanish language
00:50:02,00:50:05,"has descended into a stag-do story from ""Dance Driver."""
00:50:06,00:50:09,And that was one incredible afternoon.
00:50:09,00:50:24,"Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts."
00:50:24,00:50:25,Thank you so much for listening.
00:50:25,00:50:28,"Sydney, you have been amazing."
00:50:28,00:50:31,Thank you for having us at the Opera House.
00:50:31,00:50:34,We will be back again next week with another episode.
00:50:34,00:50:36,And we'll see you then. Goodbye!
00:50:36,00:50:38,Bye!
