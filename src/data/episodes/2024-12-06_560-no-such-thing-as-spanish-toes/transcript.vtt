00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320
 (upbeat music)

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.740
 Hi guys, I know what you're thinking, it's December

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.020
 and so all these brands are gonna start trying to

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.260
 flog me all of their merch to give as gifts to people

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.460
 where I can't think what else to give them.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.780
 And I bet that's what those fish are about to do as well.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.420
 Well, yes and no, because look,

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.260
 our merch is not just any merch.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.780
 Our merch is really cool swag

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.940
 that your bestest friends in the world

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.420
 and any fish fan in your life doesn't just want,

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:30.700
 they need it.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.780
 So what have we got to offer you?

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.660
 Well, we've got a pair of t-shirts

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.140
 and a lot of people on tour in Australia

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.220
 where we just were sporting these t-shirts

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.380
 and they were looking, dare I say it, pretty damn cool.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:42.780
 For the more understated fan

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.860
 who doesn't quite wanna commit to a full t-shirt,

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.380
 we've got a couple of very stylish little pin badges.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.340
 We also have our, no such thing as a fish,

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.340
 ultimate guide, our tour book full of weird stuff

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.420
 we've written over the years.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.060
 James has got some poetry in there

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.740
 and he's got a moss wall.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.460
 I think there's some photos of me

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.660
 or nights out after shows

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.100
 that I never thought would see the light of day,

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.420
 that sort of thing.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.980
 Anyway, to get all of that stuff,

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.540
 go to no such thing as a fish.com/shop

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.660
 and also, do you wanna get something

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.420
 a bit more hefty for somebody?

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.820
 Well, look no further

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.940
 because we have three books out between us.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.700
 Dan has a kid's book called Impossible Things.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.420
 You'll find that at the top of our website as well.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.460
 Andy has a beginner's guide to breaking and entering,

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.900
 kind of thriller come comedy

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.140
 and James and I have written a load of old balls

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.220
 out of QI history of sport.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.060
 So, there you go.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.460
 That's Christmas done for you.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.500
 You're welcome.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.460
 I am now off to audition for the shopping channel.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.700
 On with the show.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.740
 (audience cheering)

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.380
 Hello and welcome to another episode

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.540
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.220
 a weekly podcast.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.260
 This week, coming to you all right

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.700
 for the Sydney Opera House.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:18.340
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.580
 I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.260
 Andrew Hunts and Murray and James Harkin.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.620
 And once again,

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.740
 the four of us are gathered around the micropods

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.500
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.220
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.540
 Starting with fact number one and that is James.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.900
 Okay, my fact.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.940
 Okay, my fact this week

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.460
 is that break dancing can make you go bold.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:52.260
 For the people at home,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.980
 we've put up a picture of the greatest

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.900
 Australian sporting person.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.220
 Ever perhaps, yeah.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.780
 Yeah, Ray Gunn.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.180
 But this is a new study that's been done recently

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.100
 that describes break dancers' bulge, which is--

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.060
 It sounds so much sexier than it is.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.100
 It's really not, well, you know,

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.180
 takes all sorts, doesn't it?

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.260
 It's like it gives you a bit of a cone head.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.780
 Okay, because your break dancing too much.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.540
 This was about a guy in his early 30s

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.060
 who'd been doing head spins for more than 19 years.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.740
 With breaks in between, right?

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.940
 Yes, definitely.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.220
 Although it's five times a week

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.420
 for one and a half hours at a time.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.660
 So he's doing a hell of a lot of head spins.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.100
 And it was the case talked all about him,

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.420
 but in the middle of the paper,

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.860
 it said that they spoke into other breakers,

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.260
 especially in Germany,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.620
 and they found that 31% had had some kind of hair loss.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.220
 Yeah, and you get this sort of lump of squishy matter

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.060
 on top of your head, which is all you.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.300
 But it's just you've been redistributed upwards, basically.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.300
 It's like you--

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.500
 Where does it come from, do you think?

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.780
 Where does it go? That's amazing.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.140
 Where does it come from?

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.380
 So you're defying gravity, basically.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.380
 You're heading upwards.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.580
 You sort of-- Well, you're just--

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:06.740
 It's 'cause you're upside down.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.300
 So gravity still wins, actually.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.140
 Oh, actually, yeah. You're upside down.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.220
 You're right, that's doing all the work, yeah.

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.540
 It's-- So this guy had an operation,

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:15.820
 and it can be dealt with with an operation.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.300
 He was really happy 'cause he said he can go out in public again

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.020
 and people said he looked, you know,

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.220
 he looked a lot better than when he had this cone head.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.980
 But some breakdancers will wear two hats to deal with hair loss.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.260
 That's one strategy, really.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.700
 Why not wear one hat?

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.540
 What? They do wear one hat,

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.140
 and then they wear another hat on top of that.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.620
 That doesn't make you look even less like you've lost your hair.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.220
 It's not, it's to cover your head.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.380
 It's to protect against the spinning.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.820
 It's to stop you going bald, 'cause it's the friction on the floor.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.380
 Sorry, so it's not to conceal the boldness.

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.380
 No.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.580
 Just make the first hat not transparent.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.500
 I've got to say, Anna, look, I'm a man in my 40s.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.500
 I've got 12 hats under this one.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.620
 Yeah, so it's called, more broadly,

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.500
 it's called Breakdancer Overuse Syndrome, this thing.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.300
 And with the hair loss, with the bald thing,

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.780
 it's basically that the hair follicles become damaged

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.700
 because you're rubbing them on the floor so much

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.540
 and the hair just refuses to grow.

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.580
 Yeah, I went to Google it

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.620
 and I put Olympic Bolge and Breakdancing in.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.020
 OK. Yeah.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.820
 And I forgot, and I think it's, we probably will all remember,

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.180
 but it's worth just saying that one of the finest moments

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.300
 of the recent Olympics was the guy who lost the poll vote.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.300
 Yeah.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.300
 Because his Bolge took down the poll on the way over.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.380
 So there were more embarrassing bolges in the Olympic, is what I mean.

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.420
 It feels like he sort of won the moral victory there, doesn't it?

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.500
 He may have lost the contest.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.140
 Yeah, that's true.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.540
 It's not a safe pursuit,

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.740
 spinning around many, many times on your head.

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:44.940
 I don't think it's very bad for you.

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.260
 A much more long-term thing is Breakdancing Neck,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.420
 which has been known about since the 1980s,

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:53.020
 which basically comes from putting so much weight on your neck

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.940
 the whole time. It's spinal cord injury.

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.420
 But people do it so many times, the spinning round, that is.

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.540
 The record for the most spins,

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.700
 and that both the male and female records are held by B-boys and B-girls,

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:06.540
 as I think they're called.

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:07.940
 But that is Breakdancers, yeah.

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:08.740
 Yeah, the spins on that.

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.740
 Well, you could just be into spinning around on your head.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.660
 (LAUGHTER)

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:13.820
 I retract my comment.

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.220
 (LAUGHTER)

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:16.220
 Apologies.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.220
 Imagine if in the Olympics in the B-boying,

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.060
 someone came in who'd never done it before,

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.700
 but just loved spinning around on their heads.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.540
 Are they getting gold if they just, the whole time,

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:26.820
 they just do one big spin?

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.340
 Because I think the record is 137 spins.

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:30.820
 Oh, wow. Yeah.

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.180
 Complete full, yeah, yeah.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.700
 You were allowed to use your hands to keep the spin going.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.340
 Oh, are you? OK.

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.500
 This year, it was, because it was the Paris Olympics,

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.020
 and it was held, I really just like this,

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.260
 in the Place de la Concorde,

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:47.820
 which is where Marie Antoinette was guillotined 230 years ago.

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.660
 Wow. And that's just nice.

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.020
 That just sort of matches, doesn't it?

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.500
 Do you think her head spun around as it came up there?

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.020
 Yeah, it probably did.

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.260
 Do you think if she had more head,

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:57.620
 they would have just lobbed that bit off,

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.060
 and she would have sort of, like,

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.940
 just painted a little face on the top cone.

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.060
 (LAUGHTER)

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.300
 With her big rough around her head.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.660
 I should just say, I think we're showing ourselves up

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.860
 as massive docks because it isn't called Breakdancing,

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:12.500
 it is called B-boying and B-girling.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:13.700
 Yeah. Yeah, it's...

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.860
 Breakdancing is a very, very uncool word to use.

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.140
 Breaking. You say breaking, isn't it?

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:19.580
 Because I'm breaking. Yeah.

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.340
 But I gather it's one of the four pillars of hip-hop.

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:23.980
 Islam. Oh, yeah, hip-hop. Sorry.

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.860
 (LAUGHTER)

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:29.940
 Five of Islam, four of hip-hop,

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.940
 three for any sort of podium.

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.340
 Anyway, and the others, I mean, I don't need to say it to you guys,

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.860
 but they're DJing, MCing and graffiti.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.060
 Oh, OK. Is that Islam still?

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.860
 That's Islam. (LAUGHTER)

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:44.660
 Because with the breakdancing,

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:47.460
 that was coined by the newspapers,

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.740
 whereas the B-boys and B-girlers themselves

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:50.940
 wouldn't call it breakdancing.

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:52.660
 Did they call it breaking at the start? Yes.

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:54.660
 Because it's the break in the music.

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:56.060
 It's where you don't have lyrics, right?

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.140
 Yeah, so you have the song, song, song, song, song, song,

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:00.380
 then you have a little break where it's just the music.

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:01.940
 Drum. Oh, it's a drum, right?

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.140
 Oh, it's a drum, stuff like that.

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:05.540
 And then the DJs would just repeat that again and again

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:07.900
 and again so that people could dance in that little break.

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.700
 I don't think we've ever looked so uncool in our lives.

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.100
 I don't know. Then what just happened just then?

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:14.660
 What are you talking about?

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:17.620
 We're passing ourselves off as hip-hop aficionados.

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:21.500
 Yeah, OK. I want to talk about the coolest person alive,

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.060
 speaking of hip-hop. Oh, I love that, please.

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:24.660
 I think the coolest person who ever happened.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:25.660
 I'm right here.

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:27.540
 I know, I don't want to embarrass you, James.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:28.980
 No, your second coolest,

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:31.180
 coolest is the person who invented hip-hop,

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:34.260
 or the person because of whom hip-hop came about.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.300
 I just think it's amazing that it was a schoolgirl

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:40.460
 who wanted to raise money to buy some new clothes for school.

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.380
 Really? It's so cool.

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:45.100
 1973, there's a schoolgirl called Cindy Campbell

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:49.300
 and her parents have migrated in the previous five years or so

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:50.820
 from Jamaica to the US.

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:53.180
 And she wants to look a bit cooler, buy some new school clothes.

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:55.180
 She's like, "I'll just throw a big house party."

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.340
 Now, I tried to throw parties when I was 15

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.740
 and what happened to her did not happen to me.

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:01.900
 Everyone in the neighborhood came.

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:04.540
 She asked her brother, her big brother to DJ,

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:06.340
 a guy called DJ Cool Hook.

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:08.460
 I don't think he was christened like that.

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:12.900
 In fact, he was christened Clive, which is not a cool name.

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.340
 And that was the birth of hip-hop.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:18.540
 And everyone in the hip-hop movement knows that this,

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:20.060
 like, this is the origin story.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.340
 A 16, 15, 16-year-old girl went,

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:24.780
 "I'm going to have a little party in my parents' house."

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:26.180
 And that's where hip-hop was born.

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:28.020
 And everyone says that they were there, don't they?

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:31.340
 Like, anyone who was there near the start of breakdancing,

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:33.340
 they all say, "Well, I was at the party, of course."

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:35.020
 Yeah, I was there.

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:37.980
 Weirdly, in parental connections, there's another one,

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:41.180
 because I think Australia's best male breakdancers,

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.060
 Jeff Dunn, is that correct?

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:44.300
 J-Attack.

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.740
 Oh, so you guys aren't cool either, that's good.

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:48.820
 What a surprise.

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:49.820
 J-Attack.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:50.820
 J-Attack.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:54.100
 J-Attack, as he's known, or Jeff, is 16,

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:56.180
 and his mum is present at all his gigs.

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:58.100
 He's the best in the world, best in Australia.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.700
 Best Australian man, yeah, yeah.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:03.100
 But the thing I didn't know about Olympic break-king,

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:04.780
 I'm just going to say breakdancing,

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:06.100
 I'm not fooling anyone,

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.180
 is that I thought that, like, ice skating,

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:09.620
 you get to pick your own music.

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:11.740
 You know, you have your tune, you go out to that,

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:13.100
 and then, and it's not the case.

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:16.140
 In breakdancing, the DJ selects the tune,

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:17.340
 and you just have to adapt to that.

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:18.460
 You have to improvise to it.

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:19.300
 You have to improvise.

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:22.380
 So that's part of the, like, it's execution and originality,

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:24.140
 and your vocab of moves and technique,

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.380
 all of it counts in the judges.

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:26.940
 Oh, your vocab of moves, eh?

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.140
 Yeah, I was just...

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:29.140
 I'm desperately trying to get it back

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:32.260
 to something vocabulary-based, and, um...

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:33.900
 But so, for the Olympics, there was a problem.

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.340
 They couldn't just let the DJs play whatever they wanted,

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:38.100
 because it's going out on telly,

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.700
 so it has to be music that they've cleared the rights to.

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:44.780
 Oh! So they had a library of 390 songs,

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:45.980
 which the rights have been cleared.

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:48.380
 So 390 is a lot of songs you probably couldn't learn,

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:50.020
 you know, all of them and react in time.

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:53.580
 Yeah. And also, the DJs were not allowed to spend any time at all

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:54.900
 with the breakdancers,

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:56.540
 in case the breakdancers lean over and said,

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:58.580
 "Oh, can you play, like, Eleanor Rigby," or whatever.

00:10:58.580 --> 00:10:59.580
 Like, whatever.

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:01.260
 LAUGHTER

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.020
 Classic breakdance.

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:05.540
 You know what I mean, like, a silent night, whatever.

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:07.540
 Like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:09.300
 Have you thought about entering?

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.020
 I have, like, I don't know.

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:13.660
 You know what's weird, Andy? You mentioned Eleanor Rigby.

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:15.700
 Paul McCartney, who wrote that song,

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:19.340
 spends five minutes every morning upside down on his head.

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:21.020
 Wow. Even at this age...

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:22.020
 Spinning?

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:25.020
 I think it's static. I think he's, yeah.

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:26.020
 That's pretty good.

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:29.260
 So he does yoga, and every morning, he's hit 80s, you know?

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.100
 He's upside down on his head for five solid minutes,

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:34.580
 and I want to see if the cone has arrived.

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:36.460
 LAUGHTER

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:38.300
 Possibly has, right?

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:39.620
 Can I just talk about the...

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:42.900
 If you're too cool even for breaking, as I am,

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.020
 what you're really into is crumping.

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:46.260
 Do you guys know about crumping?

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:47.740
 Crumping? No.

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.780
 Can I just get a poll to judge how cool this audience is?

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:51.020
 Who knows about crumping?

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:52.660
 CHEERING

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:53.980
 They all know. Quite a few.

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.940
 Do they? It's basically clowning.

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:59.580
 But I find this so cool, because hip-hop is the epitome of cool, right?

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:04.260
 But crumping is a key, kind of new part of hip-hop dance culture,

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.460
 and it was invented by a children's birthday clown

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:08.860
 called Tommy the Clown in the 1990s,

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:10.980
 who wanted to liven up kids' birthday parties,

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:15.420
 so he started, like, jerking his body in, kind of, really asymmetrical ways,

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:17.620
 and he'd keep... It's where you keep one bit of your body still,

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:20.060
 and then you just, like, jerk one tiny bit of it.

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:22.940
 It looks cooler than what I'd just do with my hand on stage.

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:27.180
 And it became huge, and it's the big thing in hip-hop now,

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:29.580
 and people go and do it in full clown gear.

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:31.540
 Wow. I'm really interested to know

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:34.620
 what the people of the audience thought it was,

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:36.820
 who all said they knew what it was.

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:40.260
 Yeah. Was that it? Well, they're all in clown suits, so I assume...

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.140
 You all came in one cart, didn't you, today?

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:49.860
 Hey, we need to move on now to our next fact.

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:53.100
 It is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:55.340
 My fact this week is that in North Korea,

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:58.700
 it's illegal to rest your cup of tea on a newspaper

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:02.620
 if that newspaper has a picture of Kim Il-sung on it.

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:07.140
 And how many newspapers don't have a picture of Kim Il-sung on them?

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.860
 That's the question I think quite a lot of them do,

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:13.740
 and, in fact, it's the two subsequent Kims, as well, I believe.

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:17.260
 So it's probably quite hard in North Korea to avoid a newspaper

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:21.220
 with any of their dear leaders in it, and it's very, very illegal.

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:24.700
 So I read this in an interview, it was an interview in 2010,

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:27.980
 but I've checked it out, it still is the case from what we know,

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:30.980
 but an interview with a teenage girl who'd escaped from North Korea,

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:32.340
 crossed the border into China,

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:35.780
 and she was saying that any defacement of the image of Kim Il-sung,

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:38.340
 of course, the founder of North Korea, was punished.

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:42.220
 So if you destroyed any notes, any bank notes with his face on them,

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:45.300
 you're shot, and it's, yeah, the newspaper thing,

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:48.380
 illegal to put anything on that newspaper,

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:51.540
 which I don't know if there's a coaster, I don't know if that excuses you.

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:53.260
 His face is probably on the coaster.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:57.780
 Yes, it's illegal to put your tea on a coaster with the face on.

00:13:57.780 --> 00:13:59.540
 No, you should put it on the coaster.

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:02.500
 In fact, it's punishable to not put it on the coaster.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.420
 In my house, it's punishable not to use a coaster.

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:06.500
 I'm trying to say.

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:08.420
 And again, that's just shot straight up, isn't it?

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:09.300
 Yeah, that's right, yeah.

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:12.420
 So these laws are actually quite common around the world

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:16.900
 to various degrees, right, they're called less majest, are they called?

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:19.300
 And it's basically insulting your leaders.

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:24.620
 And in the UK, in fact, the Trees and Felony Act of 1848

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:28.820
 makes it an offence to say that you want the monarchy to be abolished.

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:29.660
 Oh, what?

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:32.460
 You can get life imprisonment under the act,

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:35.700
 or in theory, you could be transported to Australia.

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:39.300
 [LAUGHTER]

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:42.620
 Is that... Is that too soon?

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:43.700
 That's true.

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:44.740
 Is that still on the books?

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:47.940
 It is still on the books, but obviously they would never do anything about it.

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:48.900
 Very rarely prosecuted.

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:50.340
 They would never be prosecuted,

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:53.580
 but they keep it on the books because of, you know, just ceremonial reasons.

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:54.340
 Just in case.

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:58.940
 Well, yeah, just be a bit more careful about what you say these days, Australia.

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:01.900
 We've heard some of the rumblings.

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:04.860
 This is, I mean, so as you say, this is around the globe.

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:07.300
 Remember when we did, so back in the UK,

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:11.540
 we did a BBC Two show version of our show called No Such Thing as the News.

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:17.140
 And, yeah, that's roughly how many people watched it as well.

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:21.060
 But we were told there was at one point that we were going to do a fact

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:25.020
 about the King of Thailand, and they said to us, the BBC, you can't.

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:28.740
 You can't do it because if anyone who's connected to your family lives there

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:32.620
 and they make that connection by you insulting the King of Thailand,

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:35.780
 you will go to jail if you go to Thailand, or one of your family will.

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:38.780
 And they would have to bring all of the BBC reporters out of Thailand,

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:40.220
 they told us if we did that.

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:42.540
 It was the only thing we weren't allowed to make jokes about.

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:43.180
 That's true.

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:46.300
 But we're not currently planning a tour to Thailand, so let's get into it.

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:47.620
 100%.

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:49.020
 And let's have some laughs.

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:50.300
 I still have family there.

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:53.660
 OK, well, OK, well, sorry for them, Dan.

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:56.660
 I don't like them that much though, so it's fine.

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:58.180
 You knock yourself out, buddy.

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:00.860
 So it's still very much on the books,

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:03.900
 and the weird thing about it is anyone can complain about anyone,

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:05.940
 and the police have to start an investigation.

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:08.860
 I could just go to the police and say, I heard James being a bit rude about the King.

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:10.140
 And you'll be... I didn't.

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:11.460
 Well, I heard it.

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:12.540
 What?

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:15.380
 And then an investigation is automatically opened.

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:19.980
 So one guy got his brother locked up for a year with a Les Majest accusation,

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:21.780
 and actually, their dogs had just got into a fight,

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:23.780
 and he was annoyed with his brother.

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:24.700
 Oh, my God.

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:25.820
 It's an inefficient system.

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:29.980
 There used to be a system in ancient Rome whereby the person in power

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:33.460
 needed to be reminded not to go too far.

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:34.820
 They were known as humblers.

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:38.020
 If the Roman emperor was speaking, the humbler behind would go,

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:39.580
 "Yeah, but you're still a bit shit, mate."

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:43.020
 Like, they would just say things to bring them back down.

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:45.860
 Australian version of an ancient Roman custom.

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:47.580
 I've ever heard.

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:50.300
 "Yeah, nah, you're not great at all. Nah, nah, nah, nah."

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:51.300
 "You're not all that."

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:52.740
 Yeah, and that used to be a thing.

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:53.740
 Was it real?

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:57.300
 I've read in multiple places that it's been a long time, Andy.

00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:58.300
 I don't know.

00:16:58.300 --> 00:16:59.300
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.900
 Well, it's the same old as a jester, I suppose, really, wasn't it?

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:02.900
 Yes.

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:03.900
 If there's a fine line, you have to walk.

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:06.420
 Your job is sort of to take the piss out of the King,

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:09.060
 but be very careful when you do it.

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:13.580
 I think there was one of my favourites is Francis I, 16th century jester.

00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:15.900
 I'm sure we all remember, Triboulay.

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:17.220
 He used to do quite fun things.

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:19.620
 So once he slapped the King on the buttocks,

00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:21.620
 and that was one step too far, the King said,

00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:24.020
 "Sorry, one step too far, I'm going to execute you now."

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:28.100
 Unless you can think of something more insulting than that slap.

00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:29.380
 And so, of course, he replied,

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:31.140
 "I'm so sorry, sir, I didn't mean to do it.

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:33.500
 I mistook you for your queen."

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:35.500
 Nice.

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:36.500
 Got that off.

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:38.180
 You know, you got to hand it to him.

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:39.500
 Yeah, that's pretty good.

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:42.620
 Is it even more insulting to imply he's got a womanly bottom?

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:44.860
 Is that... I'm struggling to work out why that's an insult.

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:48.020
 I think he's saying that his wife is so disgusting

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:50.660
 that her bear arms looked like that.

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:53.540
 Wait, the arses were bare? Why were the arses bare?

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:57.980
 They all went around dressed like Donald Duck in the 16th century.

00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:59.500
 I didn't know that.

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:00.500
 That's amazing.

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.500
 No, you're right. They probably weren't naked.

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:05.860
 One of the things, just jumping back to North Korea quickly,

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:08.580
 and Kim Il-sung and the descendants of him,

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:11.140
 is that you're not allowed to insult,

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:14.940
 but the flip side of it is you actively constantly need to praise.

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:18.660
 There are over 34,000 statues of Kim Il-sung,

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:21.260
 who is still the president of North Korea,

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.300
 despite being dead for many, many years.

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:25.820
 He's still an actively running president.

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:28.060
 Well, he's not actively running.

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:31.580
 He's hardly walking these days.

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:34.300
 But he's still listed as the president.

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:35.300
 Forever president.

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:38.420
 Even a tourist phrase book has helpful icebreakers

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:40.500
 in a section when you're sightseeing the city.

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:43.300
 It'll say things like, "Why don't you just randomly say to someone,

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:47.220
 'Comrade Kim Il-sung was the most distinguished leader of our times.'

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:48.940
 That will break the ice."

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:50.900
 And then there was a journalist, a Western journalist,

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.380
 who went over there and he went to the zoo.

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:56.540
 And the first thing that they showed him was a parrot,

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:58.100
 who has learned to squawk,

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:01.300
 "Long live the great leader, Comrade Kim Il-sung!"

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:03.300
 That's what you see at the zoo,

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:07.460
 which, by the way, sounds like the most fucked-up zoo I've ever read about.

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:11.220
 They've got basketball playing monkeys.

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:15.980
 They've got a dove that is part of a figure skating routine.

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:19.300
 They've got a dog who is trained to manipulate an abacus

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:21.620
 and just do sums in the corner.

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:24.500
 And then there's a monkey that just smokes ciggies all day long.

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:26.660
 It's just, you walk up, I've seen photos.

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:29.300
 It's just got a pack of ciggies and it just pulls out a new one each time,

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:31.300
 lights it up, and he's like...

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:33.780
 "Oh, I'm not really enjoying this basketball."

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:39.300
 How much do I pay for it? Rack this up on your abacus, dude.

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:43.300
 The one person who is very positive to the leaders of North Korea

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:45.300
 is their poet laureate.

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:48.980
 And he became very, very close to Kim Jong-il,

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:51.860
 and so much so that when he wrote a really long poem,

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:54.900
 he got immediately turned into the law of the land.

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:55.940
 Isn't that amazing?

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:58.100
 I find poems hard to interpret the best of times.

00:19:58.100 --> 00:19:59.780
 I don't know how I translate it into the law.

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:01.780
 Say something about it, like no lettering or what...

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:07.380
 It's kind of tells the history of the great leaders and stuff like that,

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:09.460
 and it becomes part of the national history.

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:10.820
 So it's become kind of canon.

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:11.700
 Yeah, yeah.

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:14.980
 He's got to be careful when he's writing because it is illegal.

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:18.580
 If you're writing any of the Kim's names, Kim Jong-un's name,

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:20.980
 it's illegal to let it run over two lines.

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:24.820
 So, you know, if you're publishing a book and you have to let a word fall over two lines,

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:26.500
 that's very illegal. Don't do that.

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:29.460
 If you're writing a letter and you're getting up close to the edge,

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:30.980
 you've got to start a new line, mate.

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:32.020
 Don't split those guys up.

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:32.820
 I'm always doing that.

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:36.500
 Is it really insulting if you start writing it and you realise you're running out of space

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:38.260
 and write it smaller and smaller and smaller?

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:40.740
 I think that's extreme torture.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:41.220
 Oh, my God.

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:43.620
 Do you know what the People's Instrument is in North Korea?

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:44.260
 I rather like this.

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:46.580
 Can we hazard a guess?

00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:48.500
 You can have as many guesses as you like.

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:49.380
 I'd be impressed if you get asked.

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:50.580
 So what was the question, sorry?

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:52.020
 What is the People's Instrument?

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:52.420
 Oh.

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:53.060
 Kazoo.

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:53.700
 Musical instrument.

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:54.420
 Not kazoo.

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:54.660
 Good guess.

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:55.460
 Theramen.

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:56.500
 Theramen is nice.

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:56.900
 No.

00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:58.980
 It's lower tech, but not much lower tech.

00:20:58.980 --> 00:20:59.940
 Recorder.

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:00.500
 Higher tech.

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:01.300
 Synthesiser.

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:03.380
 Nearly accordion.

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:05.620
 Someone shouted out in the audience and it is the accordion.

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:06.180
 OK.

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:07.380
 There he is.

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:08.100
 Wow.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:08.500
 OK.

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:12.260
 If you wanted to be a teacher in North Korea in the 1990s,

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:14.020
 you had to first pass an accordion exam.

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:15.300
 Wow.

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:15.460
 Really?

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:18.020
 Because it was for songs, basically,

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:20.020
 so you could lead propaganda songs, things like that.

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:20.660
 Wow.

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:21.380
 Yeah.

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:24.660
 There's one very famous story about Kim Jong Il

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:28.260
 that he played 18 holes of golf, scoring 34,

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:30.260
 including four holes in one,

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:31.940
 which would be 20 shots better

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:34.980
 than the best goal I ever shot by anyone else on Earth

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:35.780
 with playing golf.

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:36.260
 Right.

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:36.900
 Yeah.

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:39.460
 But actually, there's been more recent stories about it,

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:43.380
 and what we think is that they used a different way of scoring.

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:46.820
 So a par would be zero points.

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:47.940
 A bogey would be one.

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:49.940
 So like, if you do what you're supposed to do,

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:51.060
 you would get zero.

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:52.740
 If you're slightly worse, you would get one.

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:55.300
 If you're much worse, you would get two, etc., etc.

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:56.180
 And if that's true,

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:58.740
 then he would have actually shot 106,

00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:00.500
 which is quite good for someone in the first game,

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.500
 but not impossible, I would say.

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.020
 Are you saying it could be the case

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:05.060
 with this whole North Korean thing?

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:07.540
 We've just been misunderstanding them the whole time.

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:09.860
 Well, the truth is that a lot of it

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:11.220
 comes from South Korean propaganda.

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:11.620
 Totally, yeah.

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:13.860
 A lot of the things that we say and that we learn,

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:15.940
 it comes through South Korean press,

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:16.980
 who have an axe to grind, of course.

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:17.620
 Totally, yeah.

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:19.940
 Well, this is from People in Exile.

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:21.700
 That's basically the only place you get actual information

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:23.540
 is people who have got away and said early.

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:24.420
 Absolutely.

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:26.340
 So it might be that Kim Jong-il

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:28.100
 was not lying about his golf.

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:29.460
 Donald Trump, on the other hand,

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:35.140
 he claims to be scoring 73 on a regular basis at golf.

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:35.940
 And if he did that,

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:38.900
 he would be the best golfer of his age in the world.

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:39.700
 Oh, okay.

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:40.420
 That's fair enough.

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:42.660
 Well, he's pretty good at stuff, isn't he?

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:47.540
 Just for clarity, I didn't vote for him.

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:49.860
 I didn't get a vote.

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:50.500
 Wish I could have.

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:54.020
 But Kim Jong-il, Kim Il-sung, by the way,

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:58.660
 I think the North Koreans are very good at sometimes saying,

00:22:58.660 --> 00:22:59.780
 actually, do you know what?

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:00.980
 We were lying about that.

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:04.820
 Because recently, they revealed that Kim Il-sung cannot,

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:07.780
 in fact, manage to teleport by folding space,

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:12.580
 which previously they suggested he absolutely could.

00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:13.860
 Yeah, yeah.

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:16.180
 Since he's died,

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:18.340
 he's stopped being able to teleport by folding space.

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:19.540
 That's probably what that is, yes.

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:20.260
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:21.460
 Okay, so he still could do it

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:22.900
 while he was alive, check that out.

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:26.100
 He was born supposedly, again, who knows,

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:27.940
 on the day the Titanic sank,

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:31.700
 which is a harbinger of the fall of Western imperialism.

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:33.140
 Oh, is that why?

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:33.140
 Is it?

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:34.020
 Is that why?

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:34.740
 It's what they say it is.

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:35.380
 Mm-hmm, right.

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:36.020
 Yep.

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:38.900
 Then he wrote an eight-volume memoir about his life.

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:39.620
 Okay.

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:40.340
 You read it?

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:40.980
 I haven't read it.

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:42.180
 I think that's too long.

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:42.900
 Well, don't judge.

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:44.500
 I think it could have done with the day.

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:45.300
 That's too many.

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:46.020
 Yeah, yeah.

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:47.220
 We're going to have to move on in a minute, guys.

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:49.940
 Okay, well, just quickly back to insulting leaders.

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:50.820
 Yeah.

00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:52.420
 There was someone called Danny Lim,

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:54.820
 who people in the audience might remember.

00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:57.060
 Who's that?

00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:58.420
 About seven or eight years ago,

00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:00.260
 he had a sign that said,

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:02.020
 "People can change Tony.

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:05.220
 You can't," referring to Tony Abbott.

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:05.460
 Abbott?

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:06.260
 Abbott.

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:08.820
 But the letter A in the word can't

00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:10.260
 had been turned upside down

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:13.060
 and sort of rounded at the bottom.

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:13.780
 Oh, weird.

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:16.340
 And with the cross kind of not very visible.

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:17.380
 Oh, strange.

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:18.340
 That must have made it very hard

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:19.460
 to understand what the sign was.

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:20.740
 Yeah, people...

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:23.060
 I'll be honest, people misunderstood it quite a lot.

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:24.100
 Oh, no.

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:26.100
 But he did get off because the judge ruled

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:28.900
 that he hadn't unequivocably used the word...

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:30.580
 Abbott, right, right, right.

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:30.900
 Abbott.

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:33.060
 Fair enough.

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:40.980
 It is time for fact number three,

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:42.260
 and that is my fact.

00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:45.460
 My fact this week is that in the UK,

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:47.220
 there is a football competition

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:49.060
 called the Tolstoy Cup.

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:51.780
 In which the War Study Department

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:53.380
 at King's College London

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:55.300
 takes on the Peace Studies Department

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:58.260
 at the University of Bradford.

00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:00.500
 Peace is currently beating war 10 to 3.

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:06.020
 It's not real life, guys.

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:07.380
 Let's not get too excited.

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:08.900
 It's very much the opposite is true

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:09.780
 in the actual world.

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:10.900
 Oh, it's pretty...

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:12.100
 What is a lovely tournament.

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:13.140
 It's a lovely tournament.

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:13.940
 It's been going for years.

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:15.220
 There was a break during the pandemic,

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:17.460
 and then they had one very recently,

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:19.540
 and we got to meet the four of us,

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:23.300
 the captain of the peace team, Dr. Alex Waterman.

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:26.900
 And so what's really great is they all represent someone

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:28.580
 who represents war and peace,

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:31.220
 and that's the name that appears on their back.

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:33.940
 For example, the match that happened recently,

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:35.380
 it was like real nail-biting,

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:36.500
 three to two in the end.

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:38.980
 Mother Teresa got a yellow card.

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:44.420
 Yeah, and Martin Luther King made it two-one for peace,

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:45.780
 22 minutes in.

00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:47.140
 Some controversial choices.

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:48.340
 I mean, Jesus, for instance,

00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:49.860
 did he belong on the peace team?

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:51.300
 A lot of people would say some wars

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:52.820
 are based around Christianity.

00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:56.020
 Did Tony Blair belong on the war team, which he was?

00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:57.540
 Or did he actually bring peace

00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:58.900
 to a formerly troubled region?

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:01.860
 We're not here to decide.

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:06.100
 Yeah, no, it does sound really cool, as in it's a nice...

00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:07.940
 They're both interesting institutions in different ways.

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:09.700
 So the peace department at Bradford,

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:11.700
 they actually, they have the original studies.

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:13.140
 But you know the peace symbol?

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:14.180
 The... Oh, yeah.

00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:15.780
 The upside down Mercedes with the extra one.

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:19.220
 Yeah, that was designed in 1958

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:20.660
 and by a guy called Gerald Holtom,

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:21.940
 and they have the originals there.

00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:23.620
 Oh, and the anti-nuclear thing.

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:25.140
 Exactly, yeah, really. Very cool.

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:26.500
 That's Bradford?

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:28.420
 That's at Bradford, yeah, it's not at the war studies one.

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:29.780
 The war studies one is really interesting, though.

00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:31.140
 They do big war game exercises,

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:33.860
 trying to work out what would happen if a war broke out.

00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:35.860
 And they actually, I mean, they're kind of on the side of peace.

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:37.300
 They're not gunning for it.

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:40.100
 They're trying to avert wars, despite the name.

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:41.300
 But there are a lot of really interesting people there,

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:42.580
 a lot of spooks as well, actually.

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:44.100
 Oh, really? In Bradford?

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:46.100
 No, the war studies department.

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:51.300
 Well, let me talk about a real sort of rivalry in sport.

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:51.940
 Okay.

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:54.020
 Cricket between England and Australia.

00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:54.260
 Oh.

00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:57.700
 There was a few interesting things about this.

00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:01.300
 After World War II, there were some things called victory tests

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:04.100
 that were held between English and Australian servicemen.

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:08.020
 And there was one Australian bowler called Graham Williams,

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:10.340
 who'd only been released from prisoner of war camp

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:12.020
 a couple of weeks earlier,

00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:16.020
 who was 35 kilograms below his pre-war weight,

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:18.660
 and he had to take glucose tablets throughout the match.

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:20.180
 He was given a standing ovation

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:21.940
 whenever he did anything on the pitch.

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:22.740
 That's incredible.

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:25.940
 And there was a guy called, an Aussie called Keith Miller,

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:28.580
 who's got a century in the first of those tests.

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:30.980
 And when he was asked about the pressure of playing against England,

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:33.860
 he said, "Pressure is a mesh of smith up your arse.

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:36.260
 Playing cricket is not."

00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:41.380
 I mean, quickening rivalries are obviously a big thing

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:42.740
 in both of our respective countries,

00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:46.900
 but university rivalries, which this is, also are everywhere.

00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:49.940
 And one of the most famous British university rivalries

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:51.140
 is a cricket one.

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:53.940
 And it's the annual cricket match between Eaton and Harrow,

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:58.660
 which are just two just very common man schools back in England.

00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:01.540
 No, they're two incredibly posh schools,

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:04.820
 and they've been playing the same cricket match at Lord's since 1805.

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:06.740
 Not the same one, they do the same one every year.

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:08.740
 They do go on a while, those cricket matches, don't they?

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:09.620
 They've been playing for a long time.

00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:12.260
 Well, it's Test Cricket, so God knows when it's going to finish.

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:16.340
 It's the oldest cricket fixture played at Lord's,

00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:17.460
 still played today.

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:19.940
 And I really liked the account of the first one,

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:23.860
 so it was Harrow actually thrashed Eaton in the first one.

00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:27.060
 But one man you might have heard of who participated was Lord Byron.

00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:30.660
 Yes, he did indeed play.

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:31.780
 He played for Eaton.

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:32.820
 He went to Eaton, didn't he?

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:33.780
 I think he went to Harrow.

00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:36.020
 Cool. He played for Harrow.

00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:36.980
 Oh, I'm not...

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:38.020
 One of those will be correct.

00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:38.500
 I think so.

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:42.660
 And so he appeared in the game, but he had a club foot,

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:44.500
 so he needed a runner to run for him.

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:47.300
 He did some batting, and then he had someone else run for him.

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:50.260
 He batted really badly, but it's quite sweet.

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:52.580
 His whole team batted very badly, so actually you're right,

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:54.580
 but he batted for the losing team.

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:57.700
 And he wrote a letter to his brother afterwards,

00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:00.740
 saying that he'd played really well, and it's just quite endearing.

00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:01.780
 No, saying that he'd played...

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:04.820
 He said, "Look, our team did dreadfully awfully,

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:08.180
 but I, you know, comported myself quite impressively

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:11.940
 by comparison, and only batted the third best of everyone,

00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:14.260
 which still meant he only scored about six runs."

00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:18.340
 But it's just so sweet knowing him as this great ego,

00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:20.260
 desperately trying to say, "I'm good at cricket."

00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:23.220
 And then he said, "Later, to be sure, we were most of us

00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:25.860
 very drunk and went together to the Haymarket Theatre,

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:28.420
 where we kicked up a row, as you may suppose,

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:31.300
 when so many Herovians and Atonians meet in one place."

00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:31.780
 Wow.

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:32.980
 Which plews that change.

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:35.860
 Speaking quite similarly, actually, kind of similarly.

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:39.220
 In 1908, the Aussie Rules League in Australia

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:42.340
 had a team from Melbourne University join the league,

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:44.420
 and everyone else at the time was amateur.

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:45.460
 They were all workers.

00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:47.220
 But this team from Melbourne University,

00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:49.540
 you could only play for them if you'd matriculated

00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:51.780
 or if you had a higher-class degree.

00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:53.780
 Otherwise, you weren't allowed to play for the team.

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:56.180
 And they left the league in 1916

00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:58.340
 after losing 51 games in a row.

00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:00.580
 [LAUGHTER]

00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:01.220
 Yeah, it is.

00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:02.900
 That's superb.

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:07.220
 Australia has quite a lot of great rivalries, I think.

00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:10.340
 Not just with other places, but also internal ones.

00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:12.340
 So, for example, which is better to live?

00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:13.060
 Sydney or Melbourne?

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:15.700
 See, it's very mixed.

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:18.340
 Canberra!

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:23.060
 Well, you know, 40% of Australia's population

00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:24.420
 live in one of those two cities.

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:25.220
 Right.

00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:27.780
 And obviously, neither have you got to be the capital.

00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:32.340
 But the rivalries are very tight on either side.

00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:34.180
 So, for example, Sydney has been named

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:36.420
 the world's best city eight consecutive times

00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:37.700
 by Condé Nast Traveller.

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:38.100
 Oh, yeah.

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:38.740
 Pretty good.

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:42.980
 But Melbourne has been named the world's most liveable city

00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:44.980
 seven times by the Economist.

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:47.620
 So, is it rather to live in the best city

00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:48.820
 or the most liveable one?

00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:49.860
 Let's ask the room.

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:51.060
 Which one would you rather?

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:54.100
 I regret... Sorry, the room is curdling like milk

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:55.060
 as I'm reading this stuff out.

00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:56.660
 [LAUGHTER]

00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:58.420
 So, can I tell you about a pumpkin growing thing?

00:30:58.420 --> 00:30:58.900
 Yes, please.

00:30:58.900 --> 00:30:59.300
 Thank you.

00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:00.580
 [LAUGHTER]

00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:02.820
 Which city is best at great pumpkins?

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:05.140
 Sydney.

00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:05.700
 Sydney.

00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:06.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:08.820
 The great Australian rivalry, number one,

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:11.380
 is the Atlantic Giant Pumpkin Growing Championship.

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:12.020
 Oh, yeah.

00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:12.980
 This is amazing.

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:14.900
 The two guys called Gary Smith and Dale Oliver,

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:16.900
 and they try and grow heavier pumpkins than each other.

00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:19.460
 The Australian record is 743 kilos.

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:22.340
 For a pumpkin, but they're very...

00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:24.260
 Nicely, they are sort of trying to beat each other,

00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:25.540
 but they're also very relaxed.

00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:27.540
 So, Dale Oliver was asked,

00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:29.780
 "What about Gary Smith, this guy who's trying to beat you?"

00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:31.460
 And he replied, "Well, I hope he does.

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:33.460
 He puts a lot of effort in, so that would be great."

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:34.180
 [LAUGHTER]

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:34.900
 Oh, that's nice.

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:36.020
 That was actually a tie, though.

00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:36.900
 It was, "I hope he dies."

00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:41.860
 [LAUGHTER]

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:45.380
 I think we can't talk about rivalry

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:48.740
 without talking about the longest-term rivalry of all time.

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:50.900
 And it's just so epic, blues versus greens.

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:52.180
 I don't think we talk about it enough.

00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:56.020
 Ancient Rome, blues versus greens, went on for 400 years.

00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:57.300
 What do you mean? What's that?

00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:59.380
 So, they were the two sports teams, basically.

00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:00.740
 They were the chariot racers.

00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:02.020
 They were split into four teams.

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:04.900
 Originally, it was reds, whites, greens, and blues.

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:07.300
 And then, eventually, it became blues and greens,

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:09.540
 and reds and whites joined one each, respectively.

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:11.700
 And they were fanatical.

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:14.500
 And it really reached its climax

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:17.780
 by about the 6th century, when it was the Byzantine Empire.

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:19.620
 And it was things like, you know,

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:20.900
 that you'd be in a big stadium

00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:23.380
 and 3,000 people would be massacred

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:26.020
 as a result of this just, like, hot-headed rivalry.

00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:27.700
 And it wasn't about chariot racing anymore,

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:30.820
 much like football rivalries or sports rivalries today.

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:33.300
 It was just kind of people who were either blue or green

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:35.300
 running and beating each other up.

00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:38.500
 And this epic moment in early Byzantine history,

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:43.860
 the Niko riots, happened because of this weird sports rivalry,

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:45.860
 which was, it was the most violent disturbance

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:47.780
 in Constantinople's history.

00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:50.500
 It was the year 532.

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:52.820
 There was a massive fight between blues and greens.

00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:56.500
 And the emperor was like, you're all, you're all detentioned.

00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:58.100
 You know, you're all doing lines.

00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:00.260
 I'm punishing you all.

00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:02.820
 The leaders of both of you are being executed.

00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:04.740
 Come along with me, get executed.

00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:06.740
 Two of the executions were botched.

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:09.540
 But it was one from the blues and one from the greenside.

00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:12.980
 So that was a lovely coming together moment.

00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:17.380
 Because they were both like, oh, you've botched our executions.

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:19.220
 And everyone was like, oh, well, let them go.

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:20.580
 You fucked up their executions.

00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:21.860
 You know, just let them free.

00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:23.780
 How do you mess up an execution in nature?

00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:26.100
 Oh, it's a lot more complicated than the scaffold broke.

00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:28.500
 Oh, yeah, that'll do.

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:29.940
 It's a project management problem.

00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:31.620
 OK, yeah, yeah, sorry.

00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:33.300
 I'm sure a carpenter was fired.

00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:33.780
 Yeah, yeah.

00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:36.500
 But there were still battles between the blues and the greens

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:38.340
 and the whites and the reds, right?

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:41.780
 The Calcio Fiorentino tournament still goes on,

00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:47.300
 which is like, it's like soccer/rugby/ lots of different sports.

00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:48.740
 And they play in Italy.

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:51.460
 And it's very, very, very violent.

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:54.260
 There was a guy called Mirko Cardelli,

00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:56.340
 who broke both his hands during the game,

00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:59.540
 but carried on playing and complained afterwards

00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:02.180
 that the main problem was he couldn't urinate properly for weeks.

00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:03.380
 Right.

00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:03.780
 What?

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:05.460
 Because his hands were broken.

00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:07.540
 I think it meant he couldn't hold his.

00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:09.380
 Not that he was urinated through his fingers.

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:13.620
 And they brought in new rules about maybe about 10 years ago,

00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:18.420
 saying that convicted criminals are not allowed to play in the tournament.

00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:21.300
 And the green team lost 20 players due to that rule.

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:21.620
 No.

00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:25.940
 Is it a descendant of the Byzantine one, do we think?

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:26.900
 Not really.

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:30.260
 The Calcio's only got, well, it goes back to about the 13th century.

00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:31.620
 Wait, and not two.

00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:34.580
 Because this one actually did end in them being wiped out

00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:35.860
 during this botched execution thing.

00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:39.140
 30,000 people died, 10% of the population of the city killed,

00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:40.900
 because they got together and rose up against the emperor.

00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:43.140
 They were like, hang on, I bet we're better together.

00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:46.100
 Do you know why we are rivals with each other?

00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:47.620
 Us, here, today, we're not.

00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:49.300
 We're all on the same team, Andy.

00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:51.780
 Okay, that's, that's loser talk.

00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:52.660
 Wow.

00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:56.980
 Is, what is it, not like a sexual selection thing?

00:34:56.980 --> 00:34:57.860
 Oh.

00:34:57.860 --> 00:34:59.700
 Not tonight.

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:02.900
 And we sexually selected each other.

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:03.380
 Wow.

00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:05.060
 There is, I just, I like the...

00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:07.940
 You know, sometimes you forget there's two and a half thousand people in the room.

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:11.220
 I'm just thinking, how is it possible for three people

00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:13.300
 to have lost this competition between three people?

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:13.860
 But go on.

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:16.420
 Why are we rivals, Andy?

00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:20.660
 There's a theory that is from the Unheimlich,

00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:22.820
 which is the German for the Uncanny, right?

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:24.900
 So Freud had this theory that the rival,

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:27.780
 it's a double who reveals uncomfortable truths about ourselves.

00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:30.660
 You sort of see yourself reflected in them.

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:31.140
 You know what I mean?

00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:32.740
 You see the similarities between you,

00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:36.260
 which creates a sense of, you know, unhappiness and unease within you.

00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:38.420
 Therefore, you react with kind of hostility and aggression.

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:40.660
 You know, like those bastards in Melbourne, whatever.

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:45.300
 That's the principle, like you hate and you undermine them.

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:46.580
 I must be the true one.

00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:48.820
 It can't be these guys, because they're so similar to me that I find them.

00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:49.460
 Yeah, yeah.

00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:50.500
 Which I quite like.

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:54.260
 I just think that word is too close to Heimlich,

00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:56.100
 which is a very important manoeuvre,

00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:58.340
 which I don't want anyone in a restaurant going,

00:35:58.340 --> 00:35:59.620
 "Does anyone know the Heimlich?"

00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:01.700
 And you getting up going, "Ah, the Unheimlich?"

00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:03.060
 Yes, it is a...

00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:06.100
 The Unheimlich manoeuvre is when you put more things inside their mouth.

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:17.700
 It is time for our final fact, and that is Andy.

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:19.940
 My fact is that Spanish people have no way

00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:22.100
 of telling the afternoon from the evening.

00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:24.580
 Come on.

00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:25.700
 It can't be done.

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:28.340
 Well, until now, because we're here to tell them, Spain,

00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:30.740
 is when it gets a little bit darker, a bit more difficult to see.

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:31.940
 End of fact.

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:32.340
 There you go.

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:34.340
 What the hell are you talking about?

00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:35.460
 You are from La Spana.

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:36.260
 This is great.

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:36.660
 This is...

00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:38.260
 OK, so this is based on a brilliant piece

00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:41.060
 that was in the Financial Times by Barney Jobs and Kudos to him.

00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:43.380
 So there is a word, "latarde", right?

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:44.420
 Afternoon.

00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:45.940
 What's the word for the evening?

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:47.060
 Latarde.

00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:48.180
 Uh-oh.

00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:48.900
 Yeah.

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:50.740
 So "tarde" is, as far as I can gather,

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:53.620
 either from soon after 12, not actually at 12,

00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:56.660
 it's either soon after 12 or potentially from 4pm, right?

00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:58.260
 So there's a gap.

00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:00.740
 But if you have lunch at 4pm or maybe 5pm,

00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:03.620
 which is very common, it's not "latarde" until 5 o'clock.

00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:05.140
 And then you go back to work at 6 o'clock.

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:08.740
 But if you say "buenas noches" to someone before 11pm,

00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:10.180
 they'll look at you like you're insane.

00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:10.580
 Yeah.

00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:13.300
 They'll say, "That's sort of an ultimate faux pas."

00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:14.580
 It's like calling your teacher mum.

00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:16.340
 It's just so embarrassing.

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:22.420
 So does the whole country grind to a halt every single day?

00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:26.740
 Well, it's not for me to say what's grinding to a halt or not.

00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:30.100
 Or are they just able to tell everything by context?

00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:31.460
 Why do we need to tell?

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:33.860
 The question I found myself asking is when you mentioned this,

00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:35.380
 "Why in earth do we need to?"

00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:37.780
 You know, it's afternoon and it's pre-noon.

00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:38.340
 That's there.

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:40.260
 I spoke to my brother-in-law, who is Spanish,

00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:41.860
 and that is exactly his attitude.

00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:44.580
 And I was like, "No, but then say it's like you're reading a novel."

00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:45.700
 And they say these words.

00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:46.420
 "How do you know?"

00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:47.700
 And he went, "We know."

00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:50.500
 They just know.

00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:50.900
 I know.

00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:53.700
 It's quite baffling as a non-Spanish speaker

00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:54.900
 to try and get your head around this.

00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:56.100
 But I think it creates problems.

00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:57.380
 Because when do you have your tea?

00:37:57.380 --> 00:37:58.580
 When do you have your afternoon tea?

00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:01.540
 What if you have it at 7pm by mistake?

00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:02.180
 You screwed up.

00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:02.580
 Disaster.

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:03.060
 They won't.

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:04.820
 Because they know.

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:05.620
 I know.

00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:08.420
 But Spain has really mixed up about time in general.

00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:10.500
 So Spain is on the wrong time zone.

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:11.620
 I think we've mentioned before.

00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:16.260
 But in about 1940, General Franco was trying to kiss up

00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:19.940
 to Nazi Germany and set Spanish time pegadit to Germany.

00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:21.940
 And that means that for half a year,

00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:24.260
 they're on the same time as the very eastern edge of Germany.

00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:26.500
 The other half, they're like halfway across Ukraine,

00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:29.540
 is where the sunshine and midday matches the clock.

00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:31.460
 So everyone is completely out of work.

00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:33.060
 They don't have a random bit of the country

00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:35.460
 that's half an hour different than everywhere else, do they?

00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:37.940
 No, that would be insane.

00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:43.540
 I think I read something that said it probably has a lot to do

00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:45.780
 with the fact that it's lighter a lot more often.

00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:48.020
 And it stays light later.

00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:49.460
 And it's the same in Arabic.

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:51.300
 You don't really distinguish between afternoon and evening

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:51.940
 in the same way.

00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:54.420
 You have the specific prayer times,

00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:56.580
 which refer to five specific times a day.

00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:59.700
 But you basically have something that means good afternoon

00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:00.820
 and something that means good night.

00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:03.140
 And that's, I guess, it's light.

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:06.660
 And maybe because in the UK, because it gets dark much earlier,

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:09.300
 you know basically whether it's the afternoon or the evening.

00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:11.140
 So Spanish people get very annoyed if you suggest

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:12.500
 they all have a siesta for three hours a day

00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:14.420
 because they actually, they really don't.

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:16.340
 Yeah, I think only about 20% of them do these days, don't you?

00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:17.620
 Yeah, and it's much shorter.

00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:20.820
 But the problem is that the workday goes from 9 a.m. till about 8 p.m.

00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:24.180
 They're like some of the longest workers in Europe by hours.

00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:26.580
 And the good TV doesn't start until 10 p.m.

00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:30.180
 A children's TV sometimes doesn't start until 9.30 p.m.

00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:30.900
 Really?

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:32.020
 Children's TV, yeah.

00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:33.940
 Okay, this is the maddest thing I've found.

00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:38.340
 In 2017, in Spain, MasterChef Junior ended at one in the morning.

00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:40.980
 (LAUGHTER)

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:42.900
 And like MPs complained about it and said,

00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:46.180
 "Could they possibly turn off the children's TV by 11 p.m.?"

00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:47.620
 Everyone is under-slept.

00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:49.460
 Yeah, amazing, yeah.

00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:50.900
 My brother-in-law, he keeps telling me

00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:53.460
 that Spanish is the superior language

00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:56.900
 whenever we're talking about our respective first languages.

00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:57.460
 And...

00:39:57.460 --> 00:39:59.620
 Well, I mean, compared to your language, yes, Dan,

00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:03.220
 but he should compare Spanish to English one of these days.

00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:05.620
 Okay, I mean, the language I speak is Australian,

00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:09.060
 so that's a bold little statement there, mate.

00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:10.260
 (LAUGHTER)

00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:12.820
 But I don't know, do we have Spanish speakers in the crowd?

00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:14.900
 Okay, a few, right?

00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:18.020
 Because while hunting, it's so hard to tell sometimes

00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:20.180
 whether a translation is a bit too wild or not.

00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:23.460
 But so, for example, I read that the Spanish

00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:26.740
 don't have a distinct word for toes, for the feet, right?

00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:27.460
 Feel toes.

00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:28.180
 Yeah.

00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:31.300
 They call them des dos des los pies,

00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:33.940
 which means "the fingers of the feet."

00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:35.540
 (LAUGHTER)

00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:36.500
 Makes sense.

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:39.940
 You know how we always say you have three-toed sloth

00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:41.140
 and a two-toed sloth?

00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:41.940
 Yeah, yes.

00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:44.580
 But actually, they all have the same number of toes,

00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:46.420
 but they have a different number of fingers.

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:47.780
 Oh, wow, yeah.

00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:51.620
 But the problem is that it all came from a Spanish translation

00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:53.220
 where they called everything fingers.

00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:55.700
 Ah, so it's a three-fingered sloth,

00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:58.500
 and we assumed it was three-finger-of-the-footed sloth.

00:40:58.500 --> 00:40:59.140
 Exactly.

00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:00.340
 But it's just three-fingered sloth.

00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:01.620
 So it can be a problem.

00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:04.020
 Yeah, how big a problem has that been?

00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:06.020
 The sloth world, honestly.

00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:07.700
 It's ground to a halt every afternoon.

00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:09.060
 (LAUGHTER)

00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:12.740
 An amazing language thing relating to day times

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:13.860
 between Spanish and English.

00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:16.180
 I've always loved the English word "day"

00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:18.420
 and the Spanish word "dea."

00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:20.500
 You know, they're completely unrelated to each other.

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:21.540
 Really?

00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:22.420
 Isn't that so cool?

00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:23.060
 Okay.

00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:24.820
 The Spanish is from Latin, D.A.'s,

00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:26.420
 which all the other Romance languages are.

00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:28.580
 Our day has absolutely nothing to do with that.

00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:30.980
 So there's come some heavenly sky.

00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:32.660
 You know, it's right to the lightness of the sky,

00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:35.060
 which is why it's quite similar to Deus, God.

00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:38.180
 Whereas the English word comes from Old English, "dague."

00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:39.700
 Nothing to do with Latin.

00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:40.500
 Isn't that so cool?

00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:41.140
 That's weird.

00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:41.540
 That's weird.

00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:42.340
 That's very cool.

00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:46.340
 In Spanish, they use reflexive verbs quite a lot.

00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:48.180
 So if I knock over this water,

00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:51.220
 you might say James knocked over the water.

00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:53.620
 But in Spanish, you would say the water

00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:55.460
 knocked over itself by James.

00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:57.300
 (LAUGHTER)

00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:59.860
 And, Dan, your brother-in-law says this is a superior language.

00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:01.300
 That's what I'm talking about, right?

00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:05.860
 But what actually means is when you show someone from Spain

00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:08.580
 like a drawing of something that's happened,

00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:09.860
 like there's a vase on the floor

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:11.220
 and there's one person looking guilty

00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:12.820
 and one person not looking guilty,

00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:14.900
 they find it more difficult to work out

00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:17.460
 who knocked over the vase than English people.

00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:18.740
 Because as far as they're concerned,

00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:19.860
 the vase broke itself.

00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:21.940
 (LAUGHTER)

00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:22.900
 And they can still do it,

00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:24.900
 but it just takes the brain a bit longer to process.

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:26.340
 That's so interesting.

00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:27.540
 Does it also mean murder mysteries

00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:28.900
 or a little bit more exciting?

00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:30.580
 Because there's the waiting.

00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:32.580
 He was killed by...

00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:33.460
 Dun, dun, dun.

00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:35.460
 Whereas we just go, "Oh, Barry killed him."

00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:37.620
 Like, "Where's the suspense there?"

00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:41.140
 But there's a thing about how the Spanish speakers

00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:42.260
 and English speakers think about time,

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:43.220
 which is just the same.

00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:45.140
 You get a different conceptual universe

00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:46.980
 by the way your language is shaped.

00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:49.700
 So English speakers think of time as a length.

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:51.140
 It was a long time, right?

00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:51.620
 Oh, OK.

00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:53.060
 It does a length stretching out.

00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:54.180
 It's centimetres, you know?

00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:55.220
 It's a sausage, right?

00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:55.940
 Spanish speakers...

00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:57.140
 (LAUGHTER)

00:42:57.140 --> 00:42:59.540
 Everything comes down to sausages with you, doesn't it, Andy?

00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:02.500
 In Spain, it's a volume.

00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:03.460
 It's a swelling.

00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:04.500
 It's a...

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:05.700
 Again, a sausage.

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:08.580
 (LAUGHTER)

00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:12.100
 It's an orb sausage, if I could put it that way.

00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:13.460
 Yeah, like a haggis.

00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:15.540
 It's a constantly growing haggis.

00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:16.020
 That's right.

00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:16.740
 Oh, yeah.

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:18.420
 So does that change things?

00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:19.380
 Maybe, a bit.

00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:20.020
 (LAUGHTER)

00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:20.340
 Yeah.

00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:23.300
 It's funny when you get to...

00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:24.820
 Like, when I talk to my brother-in-law

00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:27.060
 about his impressions of English,

00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:28.500
 you know, we could equally be doing a fact

00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:30.020
 about how weird our language is, right?

00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:30.740
 Oh, yeah.

00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:31.860
 One of the first things is,

00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:34.420
 when he started dating my sister-in-law,

00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:35.860
 and they eventually got married,

00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:37.380
 there was a bit of religion going on at the time.

00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:39.140
 They used to go to church a lot.

00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:42.820
 His impression of how we generally spoke to each other

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:46.420
 was to speak in a voice like this.

00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:47.380
 (LAUGHTER)

00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:50.260
 And so, that just used to be a thing at the dinner table.

00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:52.900
 Can you pass me those old Daniel?

00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:54.340
 (LAUGHTER)

00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:54.980
 He just thought that was...

00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:55.460
 Why?

00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:56.100
 Wait, because he's...

00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:57.620
 He just thought it was a beautiful invention.

00:43:57.620 --> 00:44:00.340
 No, because he just used to hear the beaches.

00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:01.220
 I see.

00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:03.540
 So does that mean when he heard you

00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:05.220
 and he didn't really know what he was hearing,

00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:07.540
 that's just the sound that made in his head?

00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:10.820
 Yeah, he was trying to adopt certain accents

00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:11.940
 in ways that were spoken.

00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:13.220
 And the same way that if you were speaking Spanish,

00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:15.700
 you might put on a slightly racist Spanish accent.

00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:16.900
 (LAUGHTER)

00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:20.180
 Now, I know you're referring to a previous episode

00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:22.980
 in which I tried to explain that I find their lisp

00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:25.060
 very sexy, that sort of...

00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:26.020
 Oh, yeah.

00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:27.300
 (SPEAKING SPANISH)

00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:28.500
 That kind of...

00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:31.220
 Because it's not a speech impediment,

00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:33.220
 it's a thing that they purposefully

00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:34.740
 have trained their language to be, right?

00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:35.380
 Yeah.

00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:36.500
 (SPEAKING SPANISH)

00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:40.340
 Okay, I think it's important that we move on.

00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:41.780
 Can I teach you some Spanish?

00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:42.420
 Yeah, sure.

00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:43.460
 Okay.

00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:45.700
 Can you spell the word "sox" in English?

00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:47.060
 S-O-C-K-S.

00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:49.060
 S-O-C-K-S is Spanish for...

00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:50.820
 That's really what it is.

00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:50.820
 No.

00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:52.820
 S-O-C-K-S.

00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:53.300
 Oh, really?

00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:55.060
 S-O-C-K-S.

00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:57.220
 These are really cool.

00:44:57.220 --> 00:44:58.100
 Can I just...

00:44:58.100 --> 00:44:59.700
 I don't think that's racist, right?

00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:02.100
 Like, that is the thing that they've built into the language.

00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:02.900
 Am I cool with this?

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:04.820
 Are we all right?

00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:05.940
 It's really racist!

00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:06.740
 I'm going to stop it.

00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:08.020
 I'm going to stop it.

00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:08.500
 I'm going to...

00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:09.380
 Okay, let's try this one then.

00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:10.500
 I'm going to apologize.

00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:13.380
 Um, say I meant to kill you,

00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:16.180
 but in a slightly Irish accent.

00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:16.500
 Nope.

00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:17.220
 Or you meant...

00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:18.500
 I'll do it.

00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:19.620
 I'll say this one.

00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:20.420
 Let's try that one.

00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:20.980
 No way.

00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:22.260
 Irish or Northern Irish?

00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:23.220
 Ah, Republic.

00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:24.180
 Or you meant to kill you?

00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:24.900
 Oh, do it, do it, do it, do it.

00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:26.980
 Oh, you meant to kill you.

00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:28.260
 Oh, you meant to kill you.

00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:31.380
 Well, I meant to kill you is the butter in Spanish.

00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:32.420
 Oh, you meant to kill you?

00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:32.740
 Yeah.

00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:33.860
 Oh, you meant to kill you.

00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:34.740
 How does it break down?

00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:35.380
 Oh, I'm...

00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:35.940
 What?

00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:37.780
 Why do you think so full-fledged about it?

00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:40.900
 Oh, I've only ever heard them when they sing in choirs.

00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:45.860
 I meant to kill you.

00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:49.780
 Um, just two more of those.

00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:52.580
 Fireman Derrick sounds like thank you in Albanian.

00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:53.140
 Say it again?

00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:54.180
 Fireman Derrick.

00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:54.820
 Fireman Derrick.

00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:55.140
 Fireman Derrick.

00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:58.900
 Yeah, and 12 months in Estonian sounds exactly the same

00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:00.100
 as cox tastes good.

00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:03.060
 Gladly.

00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:07.300
 There's one word in Spanish that can be spoken,

00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:09.140
 but that cannot be written down.

00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:10.260
 Oh.

00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:13.540
 And this has been stated by the Royal Spanish Academy,

00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:16.260
 which is, you know, the French has the Académie Française,

00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:17.300
 which monitors their language.

00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:18.820
 Spain has exactly the same thing,

00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:21.620
 which monitors the Spanish language

00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:25.140
 made up of immortals who tell you what the rules are.

00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:27.700
 And there's this word, which I find fascinating,

00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:31.060
 and it's the word that means, uh, get out,

00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:33.300
 and you like get out to him or get out to her,

00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:35.300
 you know, get out to him and help him out.

00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:37.620
 It is not super common, but it is used a fair bit,

00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:41.460
 and it's written S-A-L-L-E, or it should be.

00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:44.180
 But if you pronounce that, you'd say say yeah,

00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:46.740
 but it's actually pronounced when people say it.

00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:48.180
 S-O-L-L-E.

00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:49.860
 And it's incredibly confusing,

00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:51.860
 and the Royal Spanish Academy have said,

00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:54.420
 "Because this word has no spelling

00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:56.340
 that matches the way we say it,

00:46:56.340 --> 00:46:58.740
 this word is not allowed to be written down."

00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:02.340
 So this is the one word you can say S-O-L-L-E,

00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:04.180
 but there is no correct way to spell it,

00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:06.660
 and it suggests if you do want to write it down,

00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:08.100
 find an alternative.

00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:08.900
 They're crazy.

00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:09.700
 Right.

00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:11.300
 They are so, they're so hardcore.

00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:12.820
 I love, I love the Royal Spanish Academy.

00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:13.540
 I think they're brilliant.

00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:14.900
 So they, in a few years ago,

00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:17.540
 they printed an 800-page guide to the proper use of Spanish.

00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:19.540
 Like, they really care.

00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:21.060
 Last year, only last year,

00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:24.900
 they finished a 13-year battle over the use of the word "solo"

00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:28.180
 and whether it should have an acute accent over the first O.

00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:28.820
 Okay?

00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:32.180
 That was a 13-year struggle in Spanish linguistics.

00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:32.820
 Right.

00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:34.900
 And I think they concluded no.

00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:38.660
 No acute accent over the first O in solo.

00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:41.780
 But a very famous Spanish author called Arturo Perez-Riverte,

00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:46.340
 he declared, "I will put solo with an accent until the cold of the grave."

00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:48.500
 Wow.

00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:49.540
 People care.

00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:49.860
 They do.

00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:53.140
 Which he has met prematurely and mysteriously now, hasn't he?

00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:56.660
 A huge acute accent sticking out.

00:47:56.660 --> 00:48:00.180
 They're great.

00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:01.460
 Can I tell you guys a quick thing?

00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:03.860
 I've just suddenly remembered speaking of my brother-in-law,

00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:05.060
 so he's Spanish.

00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:06.180
 They...

00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:06.900
 Is he Spanish?

00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:07.380
 Yeah.

00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:07.620
 Wow.

00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:07.860
 Yeah.

00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:10.580
 So he got married in Spain,

00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:14.020
 and two nights before he got married, he decided to throw a stag do.

00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:16.340
 And so I was invited to the stag do,

00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:19.620
 and it was him and all his Spanish friends and me,

00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:21.460
 who speaks no Spanish whatsoever.

00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:21.940
 Wow.

00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:25.860
 So we went to this bar, and my soon-to-be-wife Fenella,

00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:28.340
 and I should say what I'm about to say next,

00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:30.420
 put the whole idea of marriage and jeopardy.

00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:34.020
 She and her family went home and we stayed out,

00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:35.140
 and we were having one more drink,

00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:36.260
 and just before we were going,

00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:37.620
 one of the bartenders spoke Spanish,

00:48:37.620 --> 00:48:38.820
 I didn't understand anything,

00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:43.220
 but slammed a drink down as a courtesy bottle for us to have for free,

00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:44.740
 and it was called Thunder Bitch.

00:48:44.740 --> 00:48:45.700
 And...

00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:48.260
 Sorry, is that Thunder Bitch,

00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:49.700
 but you're doing the sexy accent.

00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:54.500
 Yeah, it was called Thunder Bitch,

00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:57.620
 and that is all I remember from the end of the evening, right?

00:48:57.620 --> 00:49:01.780
 I woke up, I woke up in a hut, in a farm,

00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:04.580
 with a man holding a bowl of paella over me,

00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:06.660
 going, "Eat up!"

00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:08.500
 And I was like, "Where am I?"

00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:10.980
 Fortunately, the groom was there as well.

00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:11.940
 I called my wife.

00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:13.700
 She's like, "Where the fuck are you?

00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:16.500
 We're in rural Spain, and you've disappeared."

00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:17.460
 So I thought, and I was like,

00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:18.900
 "Oh, I was trying to look after him,

00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:20.260
 but I had no memory of the night."

00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:23.460
 So two days later, we went back to that bar,

00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:24.980
 and I thought, "This will be fine,

00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:27.060
 because we couldn't speak to each other.

00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:28.900
 There's no chat that would have happened, right?"

00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:32.420
 I get to the bar, and I've told her that I've had a very casual night.

00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:34.900
 We walk up and we say,

00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:37.060
 "Hi, can we get a couple of glasses of wine?"

00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:41.620
 And the bartender looks at me and goes, "Oh, my God, crazy, Dan is back?"

00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:45.460
 And he went to everyone,

00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:47.940
 "Guys, crazy party, Dan is back!"

00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:51.140
 And they were like, "You were amazing.

00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:53.460
 You were on all the tops of the bars dancing."

00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:55.940
 And Fradella was like, "You fucking what?"

00:49:55.940 --> 00:50:00.180
 I can't believe a conversation

00:50:00.180 --> 00:50:02.500
 about the intricacies of the beautiful Spanish language

00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:05.780
 has descended into a stag-do story from "Dance Driver."

00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:09.460
 And that was one incredible afternoon.

00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:24.020
 Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts.

00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:25.780
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:28.100
 Sydney, you have been amazing.

00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:31.300
 Thank you for having us at the Opera House.

00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:34.420
 We will be back again next week with another episode.

00:50:34.420 --> 00:50:36.420
 And we'll see you then. Goodbye!

00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:38.420
 Bye!

00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:40.420
 [Applause]

00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:42.420
 [Applause]

00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:44.420
 [Applause]

00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:46.420
 [Applause]

00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:49.000
 (upbeat music)
