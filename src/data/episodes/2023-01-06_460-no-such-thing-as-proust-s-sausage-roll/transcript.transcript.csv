00:00:01,00:00:03,"- Hi everyone, happy new year."
00:00:03,00:00:06,We have a little favor to ask you
00:00:06,00:00:09,before we start with the 2013 episodes
00:00:09,00:00:10,"of ""No Such Thing as a Fish."""
00:00:10,00:00:12,- 2013 episodes?
00:00:12,00:00:14,"- Is that not, oh, what year is it?"
00:00:14,00:00:16,"- James, oh my God, this is so sad."
00:00:16,00:00:17,You've just woken up from a coma
00:00:17,00:00:20,and you haven't realized that 10 years have passed.
00:00:20,00:00:22,"- No, no, you mean this is an episode two"
00:00:22,00:00:24,"of ""No Such Thing as a Fish""?"
00:00:24,00:00:26,"- I'm so sorry, but you're gonna be delighted"
00:00:26,00:00:28,with how far we've come in the interim.
00:00:28,00:00:32,"- Wow, well, what have we done while I've been in a coma?"
00:00:32,00:00:34,Have we told the world?
00:00:34,00:00:36,Have we made some books?
00:00:36,00:00:39,Have we won any national comedy awards?
00:00:39,00:00:41,"- Well, do you know, it's funny, you should mention that."
00:00:41,00:00:44,That's the one thing we haven't quite done yet.
00:00:44,00:00:46,And we're delighted to have you back.

00:00:51,00:00:52,'cause that is what we're supposed to be talking about

00:01:42,00:01:44,(upbeat music)
00:01:44,00:01:51,(speaking in foreign language)
00:01:51,00:01:53,(upbeat music)
00:01:53,00:02:00,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:02:00,00:02:02,"of ""No Such Thing as a Fish,"""
00:02:02,00:02:05,"a weekly podcast this week, coming to you live"
00:02:05,00:02:07,from the Bloomsbury Theater in London.
00:02:07,00:02:12,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:02:12,00:02:14,"I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,"
00:02:14,00:02:17,"Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin."
00:02:17,00:02:19,"And once again, we have gathered round the microphones"
00:02:19,00:02:22,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:02:22,00:02:26,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:02:26,00:02:29,"Starting with fact number one, and that is my fact,"
00:02:29,00:02:32,"my fact this week, is that originally Popeye,"
00:02:32,00:02:36,"the sailor man, got his powers, not from eating spinach,"
00:02:36,00:02:39,but by rubbing a lucky magic hen.
00:02:39,00:02:43,"- I love the fact that you need to specify Popeye,"
00:02:43,00:02:45,the sailor man.
00:02:45,00:02:47,"Oh, Popeye, that's how Popeye, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:02:47,00:02:50,"- So this is Popeye, we obviously know the great,"
00:02:50,00:02:52,(speaking in foreign language)
00:02:52,00:02:53,- I think that was the chicken.
00:02:53,00:02:55,"- That was the chicken, was that the chicken?"
00:02:55,00:02:56,"- So Popeye the sailor man,"
00:02:56,00:03:00,"and he was a cartoon back in the early 1900s,"
00:03:00,00:03:01,and when he originally--
00:03:01,00:03:03,"- And also beyond, if you're remembering Popeye,"
00:03:03,00:03:06,"and thinking, ""Shit, am I that old?"""
00:03:06,00:03:10,He lasted even beyond the early 1900s.
00:03:10,00:03:12,"- I don't know if he's still on TV, he might be,"
00:03:12,00:03:15,"but we all still know him, he's such an iconic character,"
00:03:15,00:03:17,"and obviously he derived all of his powers from spinach,"
00:03:17,00:03:19,but when the comic strip that he first appeared in
00:03:19,00:03:21,"was happening, he wasn't a main character,"
00:03:21,00:03:23,he was this sort of peripheral character
00:03:23,00:03:25,who was introduced to the series.
00:03:25,00:03:29,And there's an episode where he finds himself
00:03:29,00:03:31,"hired by Olive Oil, who becomes his girlfriend"
00:03:31,00:03:35,"and eventual wife, by her brother who's called Caster Oil,"
00:03:35,00:03:38,"who sails a ship to Dice Island,"
00:03:38,00:03:41,where he intends to make a lot of money in a casino
00:03:41,00:03:43,"by rubbing the head of a lucky hen,"
00:03:43,00:03:46,"and when he gets there, Popeye gets shot by someone."
00:03:46,00:03:48,So the first time we ever see him
00:03:48,00:03:51,"getting supernatural strength is when after he's shot,"
00:03:51,00:03:53,"this little whiffle hen comes by,"
00:03:53,00:03:54,"and he goes, ""Wow, whiffle hen."""
00:03:54,00:03:56,"Don't know how he talks actually, I can't remember."
00:03:56,00:03:57,There's something like that?
00:03:57,00:03:58,- Yeah.
00:03:58,00:03:58,"- Ah, cock, cock, cock."
00:03:58,00:04:01,"And he rubs the hen's head,"
00:04:01,00:04:02,"and then he gets the supernatural power,"
00:04:02,00:04:04,"and he takes out the shooter with some punches,"
00:04:04,00:04:06,and that's the very first moment.
00:04:06,00:04:07,"- It was a comic strip, right?"
00:04:07,00:04:07,"- Yeah, it was a comic strip."
00:04:07,00:04:09,"- So we wouldn't have known how he spoke, I guess."
00:04:09,00:04:12,"It was just, ""Whatever's in your head is how he spoke."""
00:04:12,00:04:13,- That's a very nice thought.
00:04:13,00:04:15,Isn't there an American restaurant called Popeyes?
00:04:15,00:04:16,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:04:16,00:04:17,- Isn't there a chicken restaurant?
00:04:17,00:04:17,- Oh yeah.
00:04:17,00:04:19,"I go in there, rubbing their chickens."
00:04:19,00:04:22,(laughing)
00:04:22,00:04:23,- You've been told.
00:04:23,00:04:24,"- Spinnich didn't come in until quite a lot later,"
00:04:24,00:04:25,did it?
00:04:25,00:04:26,"- It was a few years later, yeah."
00:04:26,00:04:27,- I think it was 1932.
00:04:27,00:04:28,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:04:28,00:04:29,"- And Popeye, like you say,"
00:04:29,00:04:32,"I think this comic book series started in the teens,"
00:04:32,00:04:34,"the mid teens, 15 or 16,"
00:04:34,00:04:35,but I think Popeye became the main character
00:04:35,00:04:36,in the early 20s.
00:04:36,00:04:39,"So until then, I think he was just relying"
00:04:39,00:04:41,on normal strength.
00:04:41,00:04:42,"- Well, he's very strong."
00:04:42,00:04:43,"I mean, he's very strong normally,"
00:04:43,00:04:45,"but when he has a spirit, he gets extra strong."
00:04:45,00:04:46,"That's the whole point of those forearms, you know."
00:04:46,00:04:47,- Yes.
00:04:47,00:04:48,"- Well, wait a minute,"
00:04:48,00:04:50,because your biceps are what make you strong.
00:04:50,00:04:53,- This has always been the bewildering thing about Popeye.
00:04:53,00:04:55,"- So he's got massive forearms,"
00:04:55,00:04:56,and the muscles in your forearms
00:04:56,00:04:58,are the ones that control your fingers.
00:04:58,00:05:00,So he's just a brilliant pianist.
00:05:00,00:05:01,(laughing)
00:05:01,00:05:03,"- Well, don't do a thumb war with Popeye,"
00:05:03,00:05:05,is what you're saying?
00:05:05,00:05:07,I did not know that Popeye was Jewish.
00:05:07,00:05:08,Is he?
00:05:08,00:05:08,- Popeye was Jewish.
00:05:08,00:05:09,Popeye was Jewish.
00:05:09,00:05:10,So Elsie Seagal was the original cartoonist
00:05:10,00:05:11,who drew Popeye.
00:05:11,00:05:14,"He was Jewish and there was a lot of,"
00:05:14,00:05:17,"there were a lot of sort of very, very subtle Jewish references"
00:05:17,00:05:20,and sort of jokes in the strip.
00:05:20,00:05:23,"Yeah, and to such an extent that in Fascist Italy,"
00:05:23,00:05:25,'cause the cartoon was popular across the world.
00:05:25,00:05:26,"It was so, so popular."
00:05:26,00:05:28,"When it appeared in Fascist Italy,"
00:05:28,00:05:30,"the creator's name, Seagal, was taken off it,"
00:05:30,00:05:33,"because they were pessimistic and so, you know, so, yeah, yeah."
00:05:33,00:05:34,But they still had to have the Popeye.
00:05:34,00:05:36,- Are you saying Popeye the sailor was Jewish
00:05:36,00:05:38,or that Seagal was Jewish?
00:05:38,00:05:40,"- Well, Seagal was Jewish and there are lots of references."
00:05:40,00:05:41,It's a very sort of Jewish inflected
00:05:41,00:05:44,and influenced cartoon.
00:05:44,00:05:47,"There's no actual scene of Popeye, you know,"
00:05:47,00:05:48,having Yom Kippur or whatever.
00:05:48,00:05:51,(laughing)
00:05:51,00:05:52,- That's amazing.
00:05:52,00:05:55,"'Cause weirdly, later on in the Popeye run,"
00:05:55,00:05:57,there was a thing where the original animators
00:05:57,00:06:01,were no longer animating it and it was outsourced
00:06:01,00:06:02,and it was outsourced to Prague
00:06:02,00:06:04,in order for them to make the cartoon.
00:06:04,00:06:05,So there was a whole series
00:06:05,00:06:07,where Tom and Jerry was made in Prague and so on.
00:06:07,00:06:09,And none of the animators out there had seen it.
00:06:09,00:06:11,And this was because there was no money to do it.
00:06:11,00:06:14,"So there was a run of 13 episodes,"
00:06:14,00:06:16,which are often called the worst 13 episodes.
00:06:16,00:06:16,- Of Popeye?
00:06:16,00:06:19,- Of Tom and Jerry because no one had really seen it.
00:06:19,00:06:20,But Popeye was done there as well.
00:06:20,00:06:22,"But the thing was, all of the people,"
00:06:22,00:06:24,"this is a credits thing, who animated in Prague,"
00:06:24,00:06:27,had to have their names changed to American names
00:06:27,00:06:28,because they didn't want audiences
00:06:28,00:06:30,thinking a communist country at the time
00:06:30,00:06:33,was infiltrating communist ideas
00:06:33,00:06:34,into their Popeye and Tom and Jerry cartoon.
00:06:34,00:06:36,"- Also, isn't it landlocked, Chair Republic?"
00:06:36,00:06:39,"So like, how would you have a sailor man there?"
00:06:39,00:06:42,"- Oh, I guess in land waterways, can I?"
00:06:42,00:06:43,- The Danube.
00:06:43,00:06:45,"- The Danube, yeah, canal-based."
00:06:45,00:06:46,"- Popeye, Danube, man."
00:06:46,00:06:47,- Yeah.
00:06:47,00:06:49,"Well, Mongolia has a navy, doesn't it, as well,"
00:06:49,00:06:50,despite being landlocked.
00:06:50,00:06:51,"- It does, yeah."
00:06:51,00:06:52,And Bolivia as well.
00:06:52,00:06:53,"- And Bolivia, yeah."
00:06:53,00:06:56,- Captain Von Trapp is in the sound of music.
00:06:56,00:06:58,"He's a, is he an admiral or something?"
00:06:58,00:07:01,Or a captain in the navy of the landlocked Austria?
00:07:01,00:07:04,- It makes more sense if you're going to have a sailor man
00:07:04,00:07:06,"to have him on a coast, in a coastal country."
00:07:06,00:07:07,- It's weird.
00:07:07,00:07:09,You know how we normally try and blow shit wide open?
00:07:09,00:07:12,We seem to have closed shit wide shut there.
00:07:12,00:07:14,- Yeah.
00:07:14,00:07:15,- I like it.
00:07:15,00:07:16,- That's what we should do.
00:07:16,00:07:17,Closed shit wide shut.
00:07:17,00:07:18,(laughing)
00:07:18,00:07:21,"- Just on chicken rubbing, specifically,"
00:07:21,00:07:24,"there is an Orthodox Jewish ritual called kapparot,"
00:07:24,00:07:26,"where you wave a rooster over someone's head,"
00:07:26,00:07:29,"and you say a particular prayer,"
00:07:29,00:07:30,"and then you slaughter the rooster,"
00:07:30,00:07:32,"and you get the slaughtered rooster to charity,"
00:07:32,00:07:35,and it's an atonement ritual for whoever's having the
00:07:35,00:07:35,chicken waver over there.
00:07:35,00:07:36,"- Do you rub it on their heads,"
00:07:36,00:07:37,or your own head?
00:07:37,00:07:38,- I don't think you rub it specifically.
00:07:38,00:07:40,You just sort of waft it around above them.
00:07:40,00:07:44,"But maybe, maybe the Wiffelhen is a very subtle reference"
00:07:44,00:07:46,to the traditional Jewish kapparot ritual.
00:07:46,00:07:47,"- Yeah, it could be."
00:07:47,00:07:49,- It's almost certainly not.
00:07:49,00:07:52,"- There's also, there was an old English bit of folklore"
00:07:52,00:07:54,where if you wanted to stop your baby
00:07:54,00:07:57,"from getting chicken pox, you would rub it with a chicken."
00:07:57,00:07:58,(laughing)
00:07:58,00:07:59,So it could have been that.
00:07:59,00:08:00,- Right.
00:08:00,00:08:00,- Yeah?
00:08:00,00:08:01,"I'm so glad we're on chicken rubbing stuff,"
00:08:01,00:08:03,'cause I actually did quite a lot of...
00:08:03,00:08:04,"- Chicken rubbing, right."
00:08:04,00:08:06,- I can feel a personal anecdote coming up.
00:08:06,00:08:08,(laughing)
00:08:08,00:08:11,So chickens will sometimes flirt with each other
00:08:11,00:08:15,by rubbing themselves on the ground.
00:08:15,00:08:16,- Okay.
00:08:16,00:08:17,"- So like, yeah, yeah."
00:08:17,00:08:18,"So there's this thing called preening oil,"
00:08:18,00:08:21,which comes out of a kind of gland above the beak.
00:08:21,00:08:23,And it contains lots of information about the birds' genes
00:08:23,00:08:25,"and about it, you know, how suitable it is"
00:08:25,00:08:26,as a mate and things like that.
00:08:26,00:08:29,And so sometimes a cockerel will wipe itself
00:08:29,00:08:30,"on the ground, for example,"
00:08:30,00:08:32,to just show it didn't leave it sent
00:08:32,00:08:33,for a prospective mate.
00:08:33,00:08:35,- Like a genome sequencing act.
00:08:35,00:08:37,It leaves its genome sequence on the ground
00:08:37,00:08:39,"for the male to look at and say,"
00:08:39,00:08:41,"""Oh, you're not prone to sickle cell anemia."
00:08:41,00:08:42,"Thank God."""
00:08:42,00:08:43,(laughing)
00:08:43,00:08:45,"- Yeah, I guess so, yeah."
00:08:45,00:08:47,- The Etruscans used to rub chickens.
00:08:47,00:08:49,"- So glad we're doing all this chicken rubbing stuff,"
00:08:49,00:08:50,'cause this is great.
00:08:50,00:08:51,"Go on, go on."
00:08:51,00:08:53,"- So the Etruscans, and then the Romans after them,"
00:08:53,00:08:55,but they used chickens for divination.
00:08:55,00:08:57,They thought they were kind of quite holy.
00:08:57,00:08:59,"And for good luck, you would get a chicken."
00:08:59,00:09:01,"It was always a dead chicken that you would rub,"
00:09:01,00:09:03,but you would rub it for good luck.
00:09:03,00:09:05,And that's probably where we get the idea
00:09:05,00:09:07,of the wishbone from these guys as well.
00:09:07,00:09:10,"You know, like, if you cook a chicken, you get the bone out."
00:09:10,00:09:13,People used to rub those little bones for luck as well.
00:09:13,00:09:13,- Wow.
00:09:13,00:09:14,- And that's why we do that.
00:09:14,00:09:15,- And now we just snap 'em.
00:09:15,00:09:17,- Now we just snap 'em.
00:09:17,00:09:18,- Rub it too hard.
00:09:18,00:09:21,You don't want that to happen in most rubbing situations.
00:09:21,00:09:22,- So they get snapped.
00:09:22,00:09:24,(laughing)
00:09:24,00:09:26,- The hen in Popeye.
00:09:26,00:09:28,Sorry to stop us from talking about.
00:09:28,00:09:31,I've just got one more chicken rubbing paste.
00:09:31,00:09:31,- Of course you do.
00:09:31,00:09:32,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:09:32,00:09:33,"No, no, please get it out."
00:09:33,00:09:34,I'd hate for the...
00:09:34,00:09:39,- Listener to miss out on your golden research.
00:09:39,00:09:40,"- Appalachian chicken rubbing rituals,"
00:09:40,00:09:42,and I just thought that would be a nice thing.
00:09:42,00:09:45,So there are lots of Kentucky waltz superstitions.
00:09:45,00:09:46,"You know, when you have a waltz."
00:09:46,00:09:47,"- Right, yeah."
00:09:47,00:09:50,- I don't know what Kentucky waltz is though.
00:09:50,00:09:51,"It's deep fried, isn't it?"
00:09:51,00:09:53,(laughing)
00:09:53,00:09:55,- There are so many traditions or superstitions
00:09:55,00:09:56,about what you do with your waltz
00:09:56,00:09:59,to make it disappear in Kentucky specifically.
00:09:59,00:10:01,"Yeah, so, I mean, it's mostly rubbed something on it."
00:10:01,00:10:02,"So, you know, it might be a chicken gizzard"
00:10:02,00:10:03,"or a chicken intestine,"
00:10:03,00:10:05,"but also bacon rind,"
00:10:05,00:10:06,"or beef steak,"
00:10:06,00:10:07,"or one bean,"
00:10:07,00:10:10,or three beans.
00:10:10,00:10:12,- Just don't accidentally rub two beans
00:10:12,00:10:13,"on it, whatever you do."
00:10:13,00:10:14,"- Oh, no, no."
00:10:14,00:10:15,- Then you come out and waltz.
00:10:15,00:10:17,"- You get double waltz, yeah, yeah."
00:10:17,00:10:18,Kill a cat.
00:10:18,00:10:19,That's bad stuff.
00:10:19,00:10:21,"Take it to a graveyard at midnight,"
00:10:21,00:10:23,"and then rub the cat on the waltz,"
00:10:23,00:10:25,and also it gets rid of the waltz.
00:10:25,00:10:27,- It feels like you go with a one bean.
00:10:27,00:10:29,(laughing)
00:10:29,00:10:31,- It's a sort of step change process.
00:10:31,00:10:32,"You know, you try one bean out of three beans,"
00:10:32,00:10:34,then you kill a cat and take it to a graveyard.
00:10:34,00:10:36,(laughing)
00:10:36,00:10:37,Anyway.
00:10:37,00:10:39,- You were gonna say on Popeye's chicken.
00:10:39,00:10:40,"- Sorry, Popeye, yeah."
00:10:40,00:10:41,"- I wanted to drag it back to Popeye, apparently."
00:10:41,00:10:42,"- No, no, no, that's fine."
00:10:42,00:10:43,Let's do more rubbing chickens.
00:10:43,00:10:44,What else you got?
00:10:44,00:10:45,"- Oh, sure, thank you, Dad."
00:10:45,00:10:47,"Well, okay, back, back, back, back."
00:10:47,00:10:48,"Sorry, my mistake."
00:10:48,00:10:50,"No, so in the cartoon,"
00:10:50,00:10:51,"we've got this mystical chicken,"
00:10:51,00:10:52,but it's not the only--
00:10:52,00:10:53,"- In the comic strip, you mean?"
00:10:53,00:10:54,"- Sorry, in the comic strip,"
00:10:54,00:10:57,and it's not the only animal in the comic strip
00:10:57,00:10:59,that had these sort of paranormal mystical powers.
00:10:59,00:11:02,There was also a dog called Eugene the Jeep.
00:11:02,00:11:06,"And this was in a 1936 Thimble Theater comic strip,"
00:11:06,00:11:07,and that's what Popeye was part of.
00:11:07,00:11:09,- I don't think he was a dog per se.
00:11:09,00:11:11,He looked like a dog.
00:11:11,00:11:12,"- We don't fully know what he was,"
00:11:12,00:11:14,"and it led to one of the most existential,"
00:11:14,00:11:17,brilliant comic strips that I think the creator ever wrote.
00:11:17,00:11:19,"The headline of it was, ""What's a Jeep?"""
00:11:19,00:11:21,"Eugene the Jeep, what's a Jeep?"
00:11:21,00:11:23,"And this is what the comic strip for kids said,"
00:11:23,00:11:26,"""A Jeep is an animal living in a three-dimensional world,"
00:11:26,00:11:27,"""in this case, our world,"
00:11:27,00:11:30,"""but really belongs to a fourth-dimensional world."""
00:11:30,00:11:30,Here's what happened.
00:11:30,00:11:33,A number of Jeep life sails were somehow forced
00:11:33,00:11:35,through a dimensional barrier into our world.
00:11:35,00:11:37,They combined at a favorable time
00:11:37,00:11:39,with the life cells of the African hooey hound.
00:11:39,00:11:42,The electrical vibrations of that hooey hound cell
00:11:42,00:11:43,and the foreign cell were the same.
00:11:43,00:11:45,They are a kind of kindred cell.
00:11:45,00:11:47,"In fact, all things are to some extent relative,"
00:11:47,00:11:50,whether they be this or some other world.
00:11:50,00:11:51,Now you see.
00:11:51,00:11:53,(audience laughing)
00:11:53,00:11:56,"For what, for six-year-olds, that is."
00:11:56,00:11:59,"He was based on a Polish person, wasn't he?"
00:11:59,00:12:01,"Which again, Popeye was,"
00:12:01,00:12:03,which I imagine they'd have had to cover up
00:12:03,00:12:04,when they wanted there to be
00:12:04,00:12:06,none of these communist influences.
00:12:06,00:12:08,But this guy sounds like a bit of a legend.
00:12:08,00:12:12,"Frank ""Rocky"" Fiegel, who was from Segar's hometown."
00:12:12,00:12:14,"So he lived in Chester, Illinois,"
00:12:14,00:12:16,which is where Segar came from.
00:12:16,00:12:18,But his parents were Polish immigrants.
00:12:18,00:12:20,"And there's one remaining photo of him,"
00:12:20,00:12:23,"and he does look like Popeye, but it's very hard to tell"
00:12:23,00:12:25,'cause he's basically got a pipe
00:12:25,00:12:26,and he's bald.
00:12:26,00:12:27,And so--
00:12:27,00:12:29,- I think he definitely looks like Popeye.
00:12:29,00:12:30,"- He looks like Popeye,"
00:12:30,00:12:32,"and he was constantly getting into fights,"
00:12:32,00:12:35,"and, which basically is what Popeye does, right?"
00:12:35,00:12:36,"He smokes, he gets into fights."
00:12:36,00:12:37,"- Well, he was a boxer, wasn't he, I think?"
00:12:37,00:12:40,"- He was a boxer, but and a nice guy, though."
00:12:40,00:12:42,"Constantly starting fights,"
00:12:42,00:12:44,but a nice guy and always protected the children.
00:12:44,00:12:46,"- We're talking about the sailor now, right?"
00:12:46,00:12:48,"- We're talking about Fiegel, the sailor."
00:12:48,00:12:51,"And apparently, according to his biographies--"
00:12:51,00:12:53,"- Sorry, that Popeye is a sailor as well."
00:12:53,00:12:55,"- Oh, sorry, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry."
00:12:55,00:12:57,"- He did actually say at the very start,"
00:12:57,00:12:59,"""Popeye the sailor."""
00:12:59,00:13:02,"- Quite specifically, you see why I added it now, Andy."
00:13:02,00:13:04,"- And actually, this guy wasn't a sailor."
00:13:04,00:13:05,- The Polish-- what?
00:13:05,00:13:06,"- No, he wasn't a sailor."
00:13:06,00:13:08,He was just a down and up guy.
00:13:08,00:13:10,- So just a guy who liked getting into fights
00:13:10,00:13:11,is the inspiration.
00:13:11,00:13:12,"- Yeah, okay."
00:13:12,00:13:13,- Maybe he didn't spend so much time
00:13:13,00:13:16,"checking out a rubbing chicken patch, you know?"
00:13:16,00:13:18,"- But he used to get sent money, apparently."
00:13:18,00:13:20,"His assistant, Seagal's assistant,"
00:13:20,00:13:21,said they used to send him a little bit of money
00:13:21,00:13:24,to say thanks for inspiring the character of Popeye.
00:13:24,00:13:24,- Wow.
00:13:24,00:13:28,- Seagal said this to the Randolph County Herald newspaper
00:13:28,00:13:30,that it was based on this guy.
00:13:30,00:13:31,And there was another person in the town
00:13:31,00:13:34,"called John William Shushet,"
00:13:34,00:13:37,who was supposedly what Wimpy was based on.
00:13:37,00:13:38,"- Oh, yeah."
00:13:38,00:13:39,"- So you know Wimpy, the character"
00:13:39,00:13:42,"who's, ""I gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today,"""
00:13:42,00:13:42,and all that.
00:13:42,00:13:44,He's always in debt and he's always eaten hamburgers.
00:13:44,00:13:46,"And according to this historian,"
00:13:46,00:13:50,John William Shushet also liked hamburgers.
00:13:50,00:13:51,- Interesting.
00:13:51,00:13:53,- Open and shut case.
00:13:53,00:13:54,- Shut this shit in my clothes.
00:13:54,00:13:56,(audience laughing)
00:13:56,00:13:58,"- His name means joke, sweetly."
00:13:58,00:13:59,- Seagal.
00:13:59,00:14:00,- Or figure.
00:14:00,00:14:01,"- Oh, yeah."
00:14:01,00:14:02,- His name is prank or joke.
00:14:02,00:14:02,"- Oh, yeah."
00:14:02,00:14:04,- Which is kind of what Popeye is.
00:14:04,00:14:05,- That was pretty funny.
00:14:05,00:14:06,- A comic strip.
00:14:06,00:14:09,"- Well, there is a serious point behind Popeye."
00:14:09,00:14:11,So there was a psychoanalytic piece done about him
00:14:11,00:14:13,in an American paper in 1932.
00:14:13,00:14:15,This is a paper called The Post Dispatch.
00:14:15,00:14:17,"It was a really, really famous paper at the time."
00:14:17,00:14:18,"You may not realize it,"
00:14:18,00:14:21,but Popeye is a suppressed desire.
00:14:21,00:14:23,He personifies the desire most of us have
00:14:23,00:14:26,both to be strong and to sock
00:14:26,00:14:29,some of the unpleasant people we encounter.
00:14:29,00:14:33,A desire suppressed because we lack Popeye's muscles.
00:14:33,00:14:34,(audience groans)
00:14:34,00:14:36,- Although Popeye himself says
00:14:36,00:14:39,he would never hit anyone as hard as he could
00:14:39,00:14:41,'cause it's wrong to kill people.
00:14:41,00:14:43,There's actually quite a sweet.
00:14:43,00:14:45,"- Wait, there's the cartoon character now."
00:14:45,00:14:47,"- Yeah, yeah, the cartoon character."
00:14:47,00:14:48,"- Okay, okay."
00:14:48,00:14:49,- The cartoon character wrote a letter
00:14:49,00:14:51,"to a paper in the 1930s saying,"
00:14:51,00:14:53,"and I suppose Seagull probably helped him write it,"
00:14:53,00:14:56,saying he'd never hit anyone as hard as he could
00:14:56,00:14:57,because it's wrong to kill people.
00:14:57,00:14:59,"And he said he's been shot 120 times,"
00:14:59,00:15:00,"but when bullets go through him,"
00:15:00,00:15:01,"it doesn't bother him at all,"
00:15:01,00:15:03,except that he always has to block up the hole
00:15:03,00:15:05,with a cork 'cause he doesn't like drafts
00:15:05,00:15:06,blowing through him.
00:15:06,00:15:07,(audience laughs)
00:15:07,00:15:08,- Beautiful.
00:15:08,00:15:10,"- Yeah, people complained about the fighting"
00:15:10,00:15:12,'cause it was teaching kids to fight.
00:15:12,00:15:14,"So after that, he carried on fighting,"
00:15:14,00:15:18,but only for the honor of old ladies and children.
00:15:18,00:15:19,Later strips.
00:15:19,00:15:21,- Children have honor.
00:15:21,00:15:23,(audience laughs)
00:15:23,00:15:24,- Yeah.
00:15:24,00:15:26,"- I guess so, original honor."
00:15:26,00:15:27,"- All right, yeah."
00:15:27,00:15:28,- Old babies have.
00:15:28,00:15:31,- But he was really positive for spinach eating at the time.
00:15:31,00:15:31,- Yeah.
00:15:31,00:15:33,"- There were reports, and I don't know how accurate they were,"
00:15:33,00:15:35,"but during the Great Depression,"
00:15:35,00:15:37,they said that the uptake in children
00:15:37,00:15:39,"who were interested in eating food like spinach,"
00:15:39,00:15:42,"well, specifically spinach, was 33%."
00:15:42,00:15:45,And that bumped it up to sort of like the third most
00:15:45,00:15:47,requested food or favorite food of a child during that time.
00:15:47,00:15:50,"- Yeah, the insane claim is that there was a survey done"
00:15:50,00:15:52,which asked children what they liked to eat.
00:15:52,00:15:54,"Their first thing was turkey,"
00:15:54,00:15:57,"and their second thing was ice cream,"
00:15:57,00:15:58,and then they claimed spinach.
00:15:58,00:15:59,- Yeah.
00:15:59,00:16:00,- So it was seems very important.
00:16:00,00:16:01,(audience laughs)
00:16:01,00:16:04,"- And then Popeye later on in the cartoons,"
00:16:04,00:16:07,he stopped eating the spinach directly out of the can.
00:16:07,00:16:09,"So you know he would like squeeze the can in the,"
00:16:09,00:16:11,but apparently they were worried that children
00:16:11,00:16:14,might copy this and might get a can of spinach
00:16:14,00:16:15,and eat directly from it and cut their mouth.
00:16:15,00:16:16,"- Oh, really?"
00:16:16,00:16:17,- Yeah.
00:16:17,00:16:18,"- Yeah, that's the kind of thing I would have done,"
00:16:18,00:16:20,"actually, I think that's fair."
00:16:20,00:16:22,- I need to move us on to our next comment.
00:16:22,00:16:25,"- Can we mention very quickly the madness of the film,"
00:16:25,00:16:28,"Popeye, which is just one thing about it."
00:16:28,00:16:30,"So there's the Robin Williams film, 1980,"
00:16:30,00:16:32,"and it's not very good, apparently."
00:16:32,00:16:32,I haven't seen it.
00:16:32,00:16:33,- It's absolutely brilliant.
00:16:33,00:16:34,I've seen it five times.
00:16:34,00:16:35,It's really good.
00:16:35,00:16:38,"It's a classic, Robin Williams' first film."
00:16:38,00:16:39,It's amazing.
00:16:39,00:16:40,"- Yeah, agreed."
00:16:40,00:16:40,It's great.
00:16:40,00:16:41,- It's mad.
00:16:41,00:16:42,"- All right, it's two against one."
00:16:42,00:16:43,- It's insane.
00:16:43,00:16:44,- But I have better taste.
00:16:44,00:16:46,"No, I haven't seen it, so it might be great."
00:16:46,00:16:47,"But anyway, the crazy thing about it"
00:16:47,00:16:48,is what it was like to film it.
00:16:48,00:16:50,So the producer was a guy called Robert Evans.
00:16:50,00:16:52,Everyone who worked tonight admits
00:16:52,00:16:54,that they were basically rolling in cocaine
00:16:54,00:16:56,the entire time.
00:16:56,00:16:57,"And at one point,"
00:16:57,00:16:59,"and they were all bringing cocaine on set,"
00:16:59,00:17:01,they'd open up like camera packs
00:17:01,00:17:03,and just cocaine would fall out of cameras.
00:17:03,00:17:04,"- I haven't seen this film either,"
00:17:04,00:17:06,but is that what he does instead of spinach?
00:17:06,00:17:07,- Yeah.
00:17:07,00:17:08,"- Yes, it is, yeah."
00:17:08,00:17:13,And Robert Evans had some luggage that was full of cocaine
00:17:13,00:17:15,that he was bringing with him to the set.
00:17:15,00:17:17,"And it went missing at the airport,"
00:17:17,00:17:18,as bags sometimes do.
00:17:18,00:17:20,"And he thought, oh, shit."
00:17:20,00:17:21,"A, we're not gonna get our Coke."
00:17:21,00:17:23,"And B, if someone finds that luggage, I'm in trouble."
00:17:23,00:17:26,And so what he did was he basically
00:17:26,00:17:28,"convinced the Maltese Prime Minister at the time,"
00:17:28,00:17:30,"a guy called Dominic Mintoff,"
00:17:30,00:17:33,to do an exhaustive search of basically the country
00:17:33,00:17:35,to try and find his bags.
00:17:35,00:17:37,"And so Mintoff said, ""Why on earth would I do that?"""
00:17:37,00:17:39,"And he said, ""Ah, well, I'm very good friends"
00:17:39,00:17:40,"""with Henry Kissinger,"
00:17:40,00:17:43,"""and Kissinger's written you a personal note,"
00:17:43,00:17:45,"""which is inside that luggage."""
00:17:45,00:17:46,And I'd really love to give it to you.
00:17:46,00:17:48,So it's really important that we track it down
00:17:48,00:17:50,so you can read his lovely letter.
00:17:50,00:17:52,So he did.
00:17:52,00:17:53,His ego was flattered enough.
00:17:53,00:17:54,He tracked it down for him.
00:17:54,00:17:56,"And then immediately, as soon as he'd done it,"
00:17:56,00:17:58,"Robert Evans had to fly back to the US,"
00:17:58,00:18:00,"meet up with Henry Kissinger,"
00:18:00,00:18:03,"and say, ""Look, Henry, I'm so sorry,"
00:18:03,00:18:05,"""but you have to write a fake letter"
00:18:05,00:18:07,"""to the leader of Malta,"
00:18:07,00:18:08,"""saying what a great guy he is."
00:18:08,00:18:12,"""Long story short, cocaine luggage situation."
00:18:12,00:18:14,"""Do you mind?"""
00:18:14,00:18:15,"And Kissinger was very reluctant,"
00:18:15,00:18:17,'cause Mintoff was an ally of Gaddafi.
00:18:17,00:18:18,It would have been very weird for him
00:18:18,00:18:20,"to write an affectionate letter,"
00:18:20,00:18:24,but he capitulated to save the shit/good film.
00:18:24,00:18:26,He wrote a fake letter.
00:18:26,00:18:26,Did he really?
00:18:26,00:18:28,"Well, it sounds like he wrote... just wrote a letter."
00:18:28,00:18:29,He wrote a letter.
00:18:29,00:18:31,"If you're Henry Kissinger and you are writing a letter,"
00:18:31,00:18:31,that's a letter.
00:18:31,00:18:33,I guess it's fake. He backdated it.
00:18:33,00:18:34,"Oh, OK, that is fake."
00:18:34,00:18:36,"Oh, yeah, that's because I did a fakery."
00:18:36,00:18:38,It's mad.
00:18:38,00:18:40,I've just got a few more facts about chicken rubbing.
00:18:40,00:18:42,"We don't have time, Andy."
00:18:42,00:18:47,MUSIC
00:18:47,00:18:49,"It is time for fact number two,"
00:18:49,00:18:52,and that is Anna.
00:18:52,00:18:54,My fact this week is that Marcel Proust
00:18:54,00:18:58,once woke up the members of a famous string quartet at midnight
00:18:58,00:19:00,and made them all come back to his house
00:19:00,00:19:03,to play a specific piece for him.
00:19:03,00:19:05,"Because he... Oh, wow, that's so cool."
00:19:05,00:19:09,It's such a cool thing to be able to do.
00:19:09,00:19:10,And this is before he was even really famous.
00:19:10,00:19:13,How did he do that?
00:19:13,00:19:17,"He just, I guess, people were more willing to do shit"
00:19:17,00:19:18,back in the day.
00:19:18,00:19:20,"It was sort of pre-telephones, right, this period?"
00:19:20,00:19:21,"Yeah, you know..."
00:19:21,00:19:23,Not everyone's got a telephone.
00:19:23,00:19:24,"Well, no one's calling them."
00:19:24,00:19:25,"Yeah, he's going around to their house."
00:19:25,00:19:28,"Yeah, so four individual houses in the middle of the night"
00:19:28,00:19:29,to wake them up.
00:19:29,00:19:31,It's 11 p.m. He loved chamber music.
00:19:31,00:19:33,"It's crazier than the Kissinger letter, I think."
00:19:33,00:19:35,I don't know how you would organise that.
00:19:35,00:19:38,"Basically, at 11 p.m. he thought,"
00:19:38,00:19:43,"""I'd love to listen to César Franc's String Quartet in D Major."
00:19:43,00:19:45,"""And nothing will stop me."""
00:19:45,00:19:49,And so he knocked on the door of the leading French violinist
00:19:49,00:19:51,"in Paris at the time, Gaston Poulet,"
00:19:51,00:19:53,who was in his pyjamas and answered the door.
00:19:53,00:19:56,"And Proust said, ""I've got a taxi waiting downstairs."
00:19:56,00:19:58,"""We're going to pick up your three mates"
00:19:58,00:19:59,"""and you're going to play me this piece."""
00:19:59,00:20:01,"And so, yeah, he went around all their houses."
00:20:01,00:20:03,"One of them, the violist, was sceptical, apparently,"
00:20:03,00:20:05,because Proust was...
00:20:05,00:20:06,He was wrapped in a big blanket
00:20:06,00:20:08,and he was eating mashed potato.
00:20:08,00:20:12,"The whole time, in his cab."
00:20:12,00:20:14,But they all got in.
00:20:14,00:20:15,Proust had a very weird life.
00:20:15,00:20:16,"Shall we just say, Proust is..."
00:20:16,00:20:17,"Lots of new years, yeah."
00:20:17,00:20:20,"So, author of one of the greatest,"
00:20:20,00:20:23,"certainly one of the longest novels ever written,"
00:20:23,00:20:26,Alasherst de Tompeh do in Search of Lost Time.
00:20:26,00:20:29,"And, you know, that's about it."
00:20:29,00:20:31,"All that was his main thing,"
00:20:31,00:20:33,because he spent a long time writing it and then he died.
00:20:33,00:20:36,And a huge eccentric in that he...
00:20:36,00:20:37,His eccentricities were sort of half-born out
00:20:37,00:20:39,of the illnesses that he had in his life.
00:20:39,00:20:43,But he famously wrote all these books in bed.
00:20:43,00:20:44,He rarely went to sleep.
00:20:44,00:20:46,He was allergic to dust.
00:20:46,00:20:47,He was allergic to so many things.
00:20:47,00:20:50,He had cork walls on his room at home
00:20:50,00:20:53,because he tried to keep out any allergies from getting to him.
00:20:53,00:20:55,"He had really bad asthma, didn't he,"
00:20:55,00:20:57,which he took cigarettes for.
00:20:57,00:20:59,Yeah. Classic.
00:20:59,00:21:02,"I've already had up to ten asthma attacks a day,"
00:21:02,00:21:03,each one lasting up to an hour.
00:21:03,00:21:04,Yeah. Wow.
00:21:04,00:21:06,"It's unbelievable that he wrote one of the longer books ever written,"
00:21:06,00:21:09,"considering how much time he just spent having asthma, basically."
00:21:09,00:21:10,Yeah. But that was the thing.
00:21:10,00:21:12,"By then, you would get these cigarettes,"
00:21:12,00:21:14,"and they would have, like, opium in them and stuff."
00:21:14,00:21:16,"So, you know, they weren't that bad,"
00:21:16,00:21:18,but they were going into your lungs.
00:21:18,00:21:20,"But, yeah. And you said about telephones, Dan."
00:21:20,00:21:22,"So, it was... They did have telephones, then."
00:21:22,00:21:24,"They weren't, obviously, super popular,"
00:21:24,00:21:27,but it was a time... Do you remember we talked about this music
00:21:27,00:21:29,that used to play through the telephone?
00:21:29,00:21:31,"Yeah, that's right. In America, the... Yeah."
00:21:31,00:21:32,"It's like the first Spotify, in a way."
00:21:32,00:21:35,"Exactly. They had this in France, and Proust had it,"
00:21:35,00:21:37,because he was in bed the whole time. Wow.
00:21:37,00:21:41,"And so, he had this kind of wires set up to an earpiece,"
00:21:41,00:21:43,and he would listen to music.
00:21:43,00:21:45,"So, hang on. When you woke up the members of the String Quartet,"
00:21:45,00:21:49,he literally had functioning opera coming into his room.
00:21:49,00:21:51,"It wasn't that functioning, to be honest."
00:21:51,00:21:54,"Like, there was one time when there was a really loud crowd,"
00:21:54,00:21:56,"and he thought that that was the song,"
00:21:56,00:21:58,because you couldn't really tell what was happening.
00:21:58,00:22:00,"So, everyone was cheering. He was, ""Oh, that was beautiful."""
00:22:00,00:22:03,"And they were like, ""No, no, that wasn't the song."""
00:22:03,00:22:05,"But this was called the Theatrophon,"
00:22:05,00:22:07,and it was very popular in France at the time.
00:22:07,00:22:09,Also very popular in Budapest.
00:22:09,00:22:14,And there was Harper's Weekly said that this system in Budapest
00:22:14,00:22:18,"had made it the city that was full of illiterate, blind, bedridden"
00:22:18,00:22:21,"and incurably lazy people,"
00:22:21,00:22:24,because they were all at home just listening to this music.
00:22:24,00:22:25,That feels like quite a personal...
00:22:25,00:22:27,"That's a bit of a sub-tweet on Proust himself, isn't it?"
00:22:27,00:22:29,"I mean, that's what he was... Well, it was a little bit, yeah."
00:22:29,00:22:32,I think they were more slugging off the entire city of Budapest.
00:22:32,00:22:33,"Oh, yeah."
00:22:33,00:22:39,"So, Proust's sort of habits when he was writing."
00:22:39,00:22:41,"So, he went to bed in 1909,"
00:22:41,00:22:44,"and he basically stayed there until 19... I think, 22?"
00:22:44,00:22:46,"22, I think he's 19."
00:22:46,00:22:49,"And he wrote for 13 years, and one of his..."
00:22:49,00:22:51,"And also, he couldn't get a publisher."
00:22:51,00:22:53,"He wrote the first volume, really struggled to get it published."
00:22:53,00:22:54,No publishers were interested.
00:22:54,00:22:58,"He had to self-publish it, you know, at his own expense."
00:22:58,00:23:01,"I think he inherited quite a lot of money, so he was quite well-healed."
00:23:01,00:23:05,And there was one person who believed in him and championed the work
00:23:05,00:23:08,"and wrote a lot of brilliant, you know, reviews saying,"
00:23:08,00:23:11,"""You have to read this author. He is changing the face of literature."""
00:23:11,00:23:17,"And that person was Marcel Proust, under an assumed name."
00:23:17,00:23:18,Really?
00:23:18,00:23:21,He paid for his own early reviews in lots of newspapers.
00:23:21,00:23:22,"Yeah, he wrote them in longhand,"
00:23:22,00:23:24,"and then he secretly had them typed up by his publisher,"
00:23:24,00:23:26,so there was no paper trail.
00:23:26,00:23:29,And he described his own work as a little masterpiece.
00:23:29,00:23:33,"He said, ""What Monsieur Proust sees and feels is completely original."""
00:23:33,00:23:39,"I always think of it as the French trying to get one up on the British and Irish,"
00:23:39,00:23:42,"because I feel like we have James Joyce,"
00:23:42,00:23:46,"and there's this impenetrable, you know, 1,000-plus-page tome"
00:23:46,00:23:50,that we all attempt to get through at some point and then mostly fail.
00:23:50,00:23:52,"And then they have Proust, where they just did that."
00:23:52,00:23:56,"And then he wrote six more volumes, exactly the same on top of it."
00:23:56,00:24:01,"Well, I think Proust came first, or certainly his first book was published before Joyce."
00:24:01,00:24:04,"Because, like Candy says, it was self-published,"
00:24:04,00:24:08,"but he went to a publisher to try and get it published,"
00:24:08,00:24:10,this guy called Gaston Gallimard.
00:24:10,00:24:14,"And Gallimard passed it on to a reader, and the reader just, it was really long,"
00:24:14,00:24:17,"so he just opened it up on a random page, page 62,"
00:24:17,00:24:21,and what he found was a boring and overwritten description of a cup of herbal tea.
00:24:21,00:24:22,[LAUGHTER]
00:24:22,00:24:27,"So he declined it, and then Proust had to do the self-publishing thing."
00:24:27,00:24:30,"But then, 10 years later, Gallimard got another novel."
00:24:30,00:24:34,"It was a very long Irish novel, and it was James Joyce's Ulysses, so..."
00:24:34,00:24:36,"Because I already regretted it for years,"
00:24:36,00:24:37,like the guy who turned down the Beatles.
00:24:37,00:24:40,"He apologized, yeah, he did apologize afterwards, yeah."
00:24:40,00:24:41,They did meet once.
00:24:41,00:24:42,Proust and James Joyce.
00:24:42,00:24:45,"Yeah, 1922, it was the year that he died."
00:24:45,00:24:47,"But it was one of the few times he actually went out, I think,"
00:24:47,00:24:50,"and he went to a dinner party, and James Joyce was there."
00:24:50,00:24:52,"And then all I know is, I think James Joyce got quite pissed"
00:24:52,00:24:55,"and tried to invite himself back to Proust's house,"
00:24:55,00:24:57,and Proust had to sneak away.
00:24:57,00:24:59,But do you have more detail?
00:24:59,00:25:00,"Well, all I've read about the encounter"
00:25:00,00:25:02,is that they hadn't actually read each other's books.
00:25:02,00:25:04,"Oh, yeah, really?"
00:25:04,00:25:06,One of the counter of two of the greatest minds ever.
00:25:06,00:25:08,They had nothing to say.
00:25:08,00:25:09,That's so funny.
00:25:09,00:25:11,"There was a guy, before he wrote his mega series of books,"
00:25:11,00:25:13,"he translated a couple of books, and Ruskin,"
00:25:13,00:25:15,"he was a huge fan of Ruskin, right?"
00:25:15,00:25:17,"And when Ruskin passed away,"
00:25:17,00:25:20,Proust decided that he wanted to make French translations
00:25:20,00:25:23,"of two of the books, except he didn't speak any English."
00:25:23,00:25:26,So he had to ask his mum to translate it for him.
00:25:26,00:25:28,"And then he did a proper, better translation"
00:25:28,00:25:30,of his mum's translation of the book.
00:25:30,00:25:33,"Oh, my God, he bloody loved his mum."
00:25:33,00:25:36,"My God, if anyone's a mummy's boy."
00:25:36,00:25:38,"Yeah, 'cause he lived with his parents until they both died,"
00:25:38,00:25:40,which is fine.
00:25:40,00:25:42,And he used to write letters to his mum from bed
00:25:42,00:25:46,"when he couldn't sleep saying, you know, ""Mother, I'm so sorry,"
00:25:46,00:25:47,"""I won't be able to get up and spend breakfast with you,"
00:25:47,00:25:49,"""and nothing would make me happier."""
00:25:49,00:25:52,"2,000 pages later, he won't get to the point."
00:25:52,00:25:54,"But his dad was quite strange,"
00:25:54,00:25:56,and subjected him to this quite strange experience
00:25:56,00:25:58,"when he was about 16,"
00:25:58,00:26:02,"which was that he was very worried about his son,"
00:26:02,00:26:04,"Marcel's masturbation, and..."
00:26:04,00:26:06,"Too much, not enough, yeah."
00:26:06,00:26:08,I just didn't think he was doing enough.
00:26:08,00:26:10,Doing it weird.
00:26:10,00:26:12,I thought you'd have this fact.
00:26:12,00:26:14,Love the rubbing cock facts.
00:26:14,00:26:15,(LAUGHTER)
00:26:15,00:26:21,"There were no chickens involved,"
00:26:21,00:26:25,"but he was a doctor, Dr. Adrian Proust,"
00:26:25,00:26:28,"and it was a time when people thought masturbation was bad,"
00:26:28,00:26:32,"and Dr. Proust thought that it could lead to homosexuality,"
00:26:32,00:26:34,"'cause Proust was gay, in fact,"
00:26:34,00:26:36,"and so I think that his parents might have thought,"
00:26:36,00:26:38,"""Oh, God, we think he might be gay."""
00:26:38,00:26:40,And so they said to cure him when he was 16.
00:26:40,00:26:43,"His dad gave him 10 francs, sent him to a brothel,"
00:26:43,00:26:46,"and said, ""Here you go, have sex with a prostitute,"
00:26:46,00:26:50,"""at female, please, and that will stop this awful masturbation habit."""
00:26:50,00:26:52,-10 francs? -Yeah.
00:26:52,00:26:56,"-So much that, is it? I don't know. -Well, back in the day,"
00:26:56,00:26:57,"you're not going to splash out on the first experience,"
00:26:57,00:27:01,"'cause it's got nothing to do with it. -Don't be disgusting, Anna."
00:27:01,00:27:04,"Well, speaking of which he didn't, it was a failure."
00:27:04,00:27:05,"This is why we know about it,"
00:27:05,00:27:09,"'cause Marcel Proust wrote a letter to his grandfather the next day,"
00:27:09,00:27:13,"saying, ""I'm really sorry, I need to borrow 13 francs off you."
00:27:13,00:27:17,"""Papa gave me 10 francs so I can get rid of this dreadful masturbation habit."
00:27:17,00:27:19,"""But what I did was I turned up,"
00:27:19,00:27:23,"""I broke the prostitute's three franc chamber pot, embarrassing,"
00:27:23,00:27:25,"""and then I was so embarrassed that I couldn't perform,"
00:27:25,00:27:28,"""and so now I need to go back and try again,"
00:27:28,00:27:30,"""but I also need to pay her for her chamber pot."""
00:27:30,00:27:33,-So... -Amazing.
00:27:33,00:27:35,Poor guy.
00:27:35,00:27:41,We have this impression of him as very sort of ill and constantly retiring to his bed.
00:27:41,00:27:43,"-He did once fight a duel in his life. -Oh, yeah."
00:27:43,00:27:46,"Yeah, and it was clearly something that mattered to him a lot."
00:27:46,00:27:51,"He fought a duel when someone accused him of being gay, of having had a gay affair."
00:27:51,00:27:54,"And his accuser was a literary critic who was called Jean Lorraine,"
00:27:54,00:27:59,"who was also gay, so to be clear, this is two gay guys having a duel"
00:27:59,00:28:01,"because one of them said to the other, ""You are gay."""
00:28:01,00:28:06,"-Yeah. -And they both survived, didn't they?"
00:28:06,00:28:09,"-They both survived, they both shot and... -They both missed."
00:28:09,00:28:12,"Marcel shot first, he went in the sort of region of his feet,"
00:28:12,00:28:14,"but didn't get him, and the other guy missed outright."
00:28:14,00:28:18,"-But you kind of, I guess, have to think about the times. -Of course, yeah."
00:28:18,00:28:21,He was outing him for something that might have got him killed anyway
00:28:21,00:28:25,"for being a homosexual, maybe his dad having written what he wrote was a..."
00:28:25,00:28:27,"-Yeah, it's... -It was a tough show."
00:28:27,00:28:29,"He had a tough life, didn't he, Marcel, or Marcel?"
00:28:29,00:28:30,-Yeah. -Yeah.
00:28:30,00:28:33,He once diagnosed himself with a brain disorder
00:28:33,00:28:37,and said that the only way to cure it was by drilling loads of holes into his skull.
00:28:37,00:28:38,"-Oh, dear. -Did he do that?"
00:28:38,00:28:43,"He begged a doctor to do it, and the doctor, quite responsible for doctors at the time,"
00:28:43,00:28:45,"said, ""I'm not going to do that."""
00:28:45,00:28:49,"-Yeah. -Well, in fairness, that's around 1910, that was standard."
00:28:49,00:28:52,"-Mm-hmm. -Yeah, they were trapanning around that time."
00:28:52,00:28:55,"-Yeah. -Oh, yeah, yeah, someone won a Nobel Prize for it."
00:28:55,00:28:59,"-That's right, they did, yeah. -The main, main character"
00:28:59,00:29:03,in Alarashesh Tapatopadu was going to be the Madeleine.
00:29:03,00:29:06,"So the whole point of it is... Not the whole point, but I read the very start,"
00:29:06,00:29:10,"he's kind of got this Madeleine cake, and he has a bite of it,"
00:29:10,00:29:14,and suddenly he remembers all the history and things that happened
00:29:14,00:29:17,because this evoked such a memory from him.
00:29:17,00:29:19,"-So I thought I'd look into Madeleines. -Oh, yeah."
00:29:19,00:29:22,"Apparently invented by a young girl called Madeleine,"
00:29:22,00:29:25,who stood in for the chef to the Duke of Lorraine.
00:29:25,00:29:28,"We're not quite sure why, but the chef wasn't there,"
00:29:28,00:29:30,"and they were like, ""You, in."""
00:29:30,00:29:34,"And she only knew one recipe, and that was her grandmother's recipe for cakes,"
00:29:34,00:29:38,"and so that's all she made, and so she just made loads and loads of these,"
00:29:38,00:29:41,"and they were named after her, apparently."
00:29:41,00:29:43,"And in 2006, there was a thing called Café Europa,"
00:29:43,00:29:47,"it was an EU thing, where every country in Europe"
00:29:47,00:29:51,"had to give their best cake or their best sweet thing,"
00:29:51,00:29:55,"and then they would celebrate them all, and France gave them Madeleine."
00:29:55,00:29:58,"-Really? Because they're quite crap. -Oh, really?"
00:29:58,00:30:00,"Yeah, they're just... Do you guys know what they are?"
00:30:00,00:30:02,-They're like a little sponge cake. -I've not had one.
00:30:02,00:30:05,You would have had one. They're just so boring.
00:30:05,00:30:07,"You idiot, Dan. Of course you've had one."
00:30:07,00:30:09,"Ironically, they're very easy to forget."
00:30:09,00:30:11,Yes.
00:30:11,00:30:13,They're like a tiny little sponge cake.
00:30:13,00:30:17,"They're shaped like a scallop, a shell, you know, a seashell."
00:30:17,00:30:19,"-They're shaped like that. -Yeah, yeah, okay."
00:30:19,00:30:22,"But in the original book, it was a bit of toast, originally."
00:30:22,00:30:25,"I thought, ""This needs a rewrite."""
00:30:25,00:30:27,I just wondered if you wanted to guess some other countries
00:30:27,00:30:29,"-and what they did for their sweet things. -Oh, my God, yeah."
00:30:29,00:30:31,"Because France has so much France, it's the land of cakes, you know?"
00:30:31,00:30:34,The Eclair. I would have submitted the Eclair.
00:30:34,00:30:36,"Well, you didn't. Have they didn't?"
00:30:36,00:30:38,Yeah. Did they win? Did they win with the Madeleine?
00:30:38,00:30:40,It wasn't a competition. It was just like...
00:30:40,00:30:41,"What's the point of it, then? What is it?"
00:30:41,00:30:43,What's the point of anything if it isn't a competition?
00:30:43,00:30:45,"You know, this isn't a competition, Andy."
00:30:45,00:30:47,No one wins this out of the four of us at the end.
00:30:47,00:30:50,Don't be ridiculous. We've been scoring for the last 450 episodes.
00:30:50,00:30:53,-I'm definitely confident. -I actually can imagine Andy going home
00:30:53,00:30:56,and having a little white barge when he puts that in.
00:30:56,00:30:58,"Another great win, Andy. Well done."
00:30:58,00:31:02,The soul metric is a number of chicken-rubbing references
00:31:02,00:31:04,made throughout the show.
00:31:04,00:31:06,"OK, so what other countries have made it?"
00:31:06,00:31:09,"I mean, yeah, just that. They're all relatively easy to guess. Belgium."
00:31:09,00:31:12,-It has to be a sweet thing. -Croissant?
00:31:12,00:31:15,-Croissants in Belgium. -Sweet chips.
00:31:15,00:31:17,Sweet chips.
00:31:17,00:31:20,"Like, honey... Honeyfried."
00:31:20,00:31:23,"-Waffles. -Waffles, waffles, waffles."
00:31:23,00:31:25,"Portugal, pastel de nata, for instance."
00:31:25,00:31:27,Don't give it all away. Don't give it all away.
00:31:27,00:31:29,"I just thought we'd go straight, maybe, to the UK."
00:31:29,00:31:31,Can you guess what the UK gets? Bloody hell.
00:31:31,00:31:34,"Oh, that sort of pink Tottenham cake that you get in Gregg's."
00:31:34,00:31:36,It's very nice.
00:31:36,00:31:38,It's so nice.
00:31:38,00:31:40,I don't know what that is.
00:31:40,00:31:42,I'm pretty sure it wasn't from Gregg's.
00:31:42,00:31:44,"OK, OK. Victoria's sponge cake."
00:31:44,00:31:46,"No, no."
00:31:46,00:31:48,Thick Norf.
00:31:48,00:31:50,-Thick Norf? -Thick Norf?
00:31:50,00:31:52,"-Oh, those buns. -Fervent Norf."
00:31:52,00:31:54,-Scottish... -Scottish roll.
00:31:54,00:31:56,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:56,00:31:58,A Scotch egg.
00:31:58,00:32:00,They misunderstood the category and they gave a Scotch egg.
00:32:00,00:32:02,A deep-fried Mars bar.
00:32:02,00:32:04,[LAUGHTER]
00:32:04,00:32:06,-A haggis. -A haggis.
00:32:06,00:32:08,-A sweet haggis. -A sweet...
00:32:08,00:32:10,"What, and sausage roll was fine?"
00:32:10,00:32:12,-You said sausage roll. -That was me?
00:32:12,00:32:14,"Oh, my God."
00:32:14,00:32:16,It was shortbread.
00:32:16,00:32:19,"Oh, OK."
00:32:19,00:32:21,"And Denmark went for the Danish pastry,"
00:32:21,00:32:23,even though they were invented in Austria.
00:32:23,00:32:25,-Ooh. -Sneaky.
00:32:25,00:32:27,And who won?
00:32:27,00:32:29,[LAUGHTER]
00:32:29,00:32:31,I think the Madeleine bit
00:32:31,00:32:33,is really only famous because
00:32:33,00:32:35,it's so near the beginning.
00:32:35,00:32:37,It's the only bit anyone's got to.
00:32:37,00:32:39,I have to say I have read
00:32:39,00:32:41,and intend to when I have
00:32:41,00:32:43,a period of time off next year.
00:32:43,00:32:45,"Read properly, but I researched it on Purdue"
00:32:45,00:32:47,"because I think people are really hard on it,"
00:32:47,00:32:49,even at the time they said it was impenetrable.
00:32:49,00:32:52,And I think it's really fun to read from the 40 pages I read.
00:32:52,00:32:54,"But the Madeleine does come up within those 40 pages,"
00:32:54,00:32:56,and it's not that relevant after that.
00:32:56,00:32:58,"But he did, it shows how much he agonised"
00:32:58,00:33:00,"over everything, that as you said, Andy,"
00:33:00,00:33:02,it was a piece of toast for a bit.
00:33:02,00:33:04,"It was also a piece of stale bread,"
00:33:04,00:33:06,"which is quite, I don't know why you would eat that."
00:33:06,00:33:08,It was...
00:33:08,00:33:10,"It was a sausage roll at one stage, wasn't it?"
00:33:10,00:33:12,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:12,00:33:16,"OK, it is time"
00:33:16,00:33:18,"for fact number three,"
00:33:18,00:33:20,and that is Andy.
00:33:20,00:33:22,"My fact is that in the 1920s,"
00:33:22,00:33:24,"a smart young man would have two handkerchiefs,"
00:33:24,00:33:26,a blower and a shower.
00:33:26,00:33:28,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:28,00:33:32,Yeah.
00:33:32,00:33:34,It's disgusting.
00:33:34,00:33:36,It's disgusting.
00:33:36,00:33:38,What's the difference between them?
00:33:38,00:33:40,"Yes, there is a difference."
00:33:40,00:33:42,"So, I got this from, I was reading an old novel"
00:33:42,00:33:44,"called Green Banks by Dorothy Whipple,"
00:33:44,00:33:46,"which is great, she's great,"
00:33:46,00:33:48,and there's a scene in it where there's a young man
00:33:48,00:33:50,"waiting for his girlfriend,"
00:33:50,00:33:52,"and he talks about having his blower in his shower,"
00:33:52,00:33:54,and I just peaked my interest.
00:33:54,00:33:56,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:56,00:33:58,It's very funny.
00:33:58,00:34:00,It's hard to google.
00:34:00,00:34:02,"So, the shower is the one you have"
00:34:02,00:34:04,"in your top pocket, the sort of pocket square"
00:34:04,00:34:06,"that looks incredibly neat and jazzy,"
00:34:06,00:34:08,and then the blower is the one
00:34:08,00:34:10,"you keep up your sleeve with all the snot on it,"
00:34:10,00:34:12,and that's the difference between them.
00:34:12,00:34:14,Could the shower become a blower?
00:34:14,00:34:16,"Oh, yes."
00:34:16,00:34:18,Absolutely.
00:34:18,00:34:20,"But you couldn't make a blower a shower, could you?"
00:34:20,00:34:22,No. No.
00:34:22,00:34:24,"You can blow a shower, but you can't show a blower."
00:34:24,00:34:26,[LAUGHTER]
00:34:26,00:34:28,I disagree.
00:34:28,00:34:30,It depends on where you're blowing on the blower.
00:34:30,00:34:32,"If you blow on the blower in, like, a top corner,"
00:34:32,00:34:34,"and then you fold it down, half of it,"
00:34:34,00:34:36,"it's like an iceberg, a shower."
00:34:36,00:34:38,There's a lot of it below the surface area.
00:34:38,00:34:40,"Well, okay."
00:34:40,00:34:42,"Yeah, just don't blow on the show bit of your blower."
00:34:42,00:34:44,"But it could start to come through the pocket, you know, like..."
00:34:44,00:34:46,How?
00:34:46,00:34:48,If you've got enough... How stocky are you?
00:34:48,00:34:50,"If you've got that cold, then you don't want"
00:34:50,00:34:52,to snot seeping out of the bottom of your pocket
00:34:52,00:34:54,with the shower proudly seeping out the top.
00:34:54,00:34:56,"No, that's true. Yeah."
00:34:56,00:34:58,I say keep them separate. I say keep them separate.
00:34:58,00:35:00,Dan's the one who's proposed this Maverick system where you can...
00:35:00,00:35:02,[LAUGHTER]
00:35:02,00:35:04,"But it's rare, this usage of these phrases,"
00:35:04,00:35:06,but it did exist at the time.
00:35:06,00:35:08,"It crops up in the New York Times in 1927,"
00:35:08,00:35:10,and it's a report about the handkerchief
00:35:10,00:35:12,"being something from ancient China, you know, originally,"
00:35:12,00:35:14,the only show was not blowers.
00:35:14,00:35:16,"And it didn't used to be for that, did it?"
00:35:16,00:35:18,We only actually started blowing anything into handkerchiefs
00:35:18,00:35:20,in about 400 years ago.
00:35:20,00:35:22,And it seems like a long time ago.
00:35:22,00:35:24,"But we had handkerchiefs long before that,"
00:35:24,00:35:26,"or kerchiefs, which are just..."
00:35:26,00:35:28,It's just a word for something that wraps
00:35:28,00:35:30,"around your head, in fact."
00:35:30,00:35:32,A headkerchief?
00:35:32,00:35:34,"Well, this is what's so weird."
00:35:34,00:35:36,"A kerchief is literally a head covering,"
00:35:36,00:35:38,"chief head, and then ker was covering."
00:35:38,00:35:40,"And so now we have a hand-head covering,"
00:35:40,00:35:42,is the word?
00:35:42,00:35:44,"Is a head covering you hold in your hand, basically."
00:35:44,00:35:46,Yeah.
00:35:46,00:35:48,"I always thought that kerchief,"
00:35:48,00:35:50,"when people say it, as they often do,"
00:35:50,00:35:52,was an abbreviation of handkerchief.
00:35:52,00:35:54,Didn't know it had gone the other way.
00:35:54,00:35:56,"We know the first person, possibly,"
00:35:56,00:35:58,who blew their nose on a handkerchief.
00:35:58,00:36:00,"Kidding, really? What?"
00:36:00,00:36:02,"Well, we know the first person who wrote about it."
00:36:02,00:36:04,"And this was a guy called Desiderius Erasmus,"
00:36:04,00:36:06,who we have mentioned once or twice before.
00:36:06,00:36:08,The philosopher?
00:36:08,00:36:10,The philosopher and religious scholar.
00:36:10,00:36:12,"But he also, and we have said this before,"
00:36:12,00:36:14,he wrote a best-selling book
00:36:14,00:36:16,on etiquette.
00:36:16,00:36:18,"And at one stage, it was a best-selling book"
00:36:18,00:36:20,"in the whole of Europe for dozens and dozens,"
00:36:20,00:36:22,if not 100 years after the Bible.
00:36:22,00:36:24,"Basically, the Bible and then this."
00:36:24,00:36:26,"And in this book, it said stuff like,"
00:36:26,00:36:28,"""Do not be afraid of vomiting."
00:36:28,00:36:30,"It is not vomiting, but holding vomits"
00:36:30,00:36:32,"in your throat that's foul."""
00:36:32,00:36:34,Mmm.
00:36:34,00:36:36,Politely disagree.
00:36:36,00:36:38,"OK. Well, let's see."
00:36:38,00:36:40,Having been up and down some high streets
00:36:40,00:36:42,"on an early Sunday morning,"
00:36:42,00:36:44,sometimes you do wish people had held it
00:36:44,00:36:46,in their throat a bit.
00:36:46,00:36:48,"He also said, ""If you cannot swallow"
00:36:48,00:36:50,"a piece of food, turn around discreetly"
00:36:50,00:36:52,"and throw it somewhere."""
00:36:52,00:36:54,"Oh, that is good advice."
00:36:54,00:36:56,"That's good. And finally,"
00:36:56,00:36:58,"""Do not move back and forth on your chair."
00:36:58,00:37:00,Whoever does that gives the impression
00:37:00,00:37:02,of constantly breaking or trying
00:37:02,00:37:04,"to break wind."""
00:37:04,00:37:06,Just America.
00:37:06,00:37:08,"Oh, I think it was him, sorry,"
00:37:08,00:37:10,"who said, ""Because this was just about the time"
00:37:10,00:37:12,when handkerchiefs were starting to be blown
00:37:12,00:37:14,"noses on."""
00:37:14,00:37:16,Have noses blown on them.
00:37:16,00:37:18,"And so, some didn't, some didn't."
00:37:18,00:37:20,"And he said, ""If you need to blow your nose,"
00:37:20,00:37:22,"you can do it on the floor, not a table."""
00:37:22,00:37:24,On the floor? On the floor? Yeah.
00:37:24,00:37:26,"Blow your nose on the floor? Oh, right."
00:37:26,00:37:28,Put your finger to your nostril and blow it
00:37:28,00:37:30,"in the direction. Yeah, sorry."
00:37:30,00:37:32,You don't have to rub your face against the floor.
00:37:32,00:37:34,"Yeah, exactly."
00:37:34,00:37:36,"But he said, ""If it is visible,"
00:37:36,00:37:38,you do have to keep stepping over it
00:37:38,00:37:40,"and on it until it's gone away."""
00:37:40,00:37:42,"Yeah. And he was basically, because people"
00:37:42,00:37:44,were doing that or wiping out on their clothes
00:37:44,00:37:46,"and he said, ""This was an improvement,"" which I think"
00:37:46,00:37:48,even Andy will admit. Yeah.
00:37:48,00:37:50,The handkerchief? Yeah. Definitely an improvement.
00:37:50,00:37:52,"No, no, they're blowing on the floor compared to blowing on your clothes"
00:37:52,00:37:54,"because I would say blowing, I'd probably do a subtle blow"
00:37:54,00:37:56,"into my cuff rather than onto the floor, wouldn't you?"
00:37:56,00:37:58,Depends on the scale of the blow.
00:37:58,00:38:00,"Yeah, it depends. I just think it's completely..."
00:38:00,00:38:02,Sounds like with your leaking handkerchiefs
00:38:02,00:38:04,as a dangerous manoeuvre.
00:38:04,00:38:06,"There was a thing that I read, which is that"
00:38:06,00:38:08,there was a period where people weren't carrying
00:38:08,00:38:10,"two handkerchiefs on them, but 30."
00:38:10,00:38:12,This was actually as part of
00:38:12,00:38:14,defence against
00:38:14,00:38:16,"bullets. So what this was is,"
00:38:16,00:38:18,"in the late 1800s,"
00:38:18,00:38:20,there was a physician called George E. Goodfellow.
00:38:20,00:38:22,"He lived in Tomb Zone, Arizona,"
00:38:22,00:38:24,"or certainly was there at the time,"
00:38:24,00:38:26,and there was a post-mortem that was done on a man
00:38:26,00:38:28,"who'd been shot, and there was a silk handkerchief"
00:38:28,00:38:30,"in his breast pocket, and they realised"
00:38:30,00:38:32,that the silk handkerchief had
00:38:32,00:38:34,significantly helped for the bullet
00:38:34,00:38:36,"to penetrate less. It was like, wow, that dented"
00:38:36,00:38:38,"the force of which it went. So he thought,"
00:38:38,00:38:40,"""What if we dressed"
00:38:40,00:38:42,"in lots of handkerchiefs, then"
00:38:42,00:38:44,"we would never die?"" So he invented"
00:38:44,00:38:46,what was... This is such a chaotic...
00:38:46,00:38:48,"premature bulletproof vest,"
00:38:48,00:38:50,whereby you wore 30 layers
00:38:50,00:38:52,of handkerchiefs on your body.
00:38:52,00:38:54,"Yeah, and I think"
00:38:54,00:38:56,it worked. I think people were shocked.
00:38:56,00:38:58,"He did, until he got a really heavy cold,"
00:38:58,00:39:00,and he just had to keep pulling around.
00:39:00,00:39:02,He became less and less safe.
00:39:02,00:39:04,Did people actually wear it?
00:39:04,00:39:06,Or was it just him trying to market his product?
00:39:06,00:39:08,It was him just experimenting with the idea
00:39:08,00:39:10,of bulletproof vests didn't need
00:39:10,00:39:12,"to be metal plating, which is what everyone"
00:39:12,00:39:14,was using at this point. The problem is
00:39:14,00:39:16,30 handkerchief vests weighed
00:39:16,00:39:18,"much more than a metal plating, so..."
00:39:18,00:39:20,But it is... It is white.
00:39:20,00:39:22,No Morris Dancer has ever been shot.
00:39:22,00:39:24,Because they've got the skills to move the handkerchief
00:39:24,00:39:26,into position at the right time.
00:39:26,00:39:28,"So, handkerchief."
00:39:28,00:39:30,"Yeah. The word ""hanky-panky""."
00:39:30,00:39:32,"Oh, OK."
00:39:32,00:39:34,Does it come... Is it related to handkerchiefs?
00:39:34,00:39:36,It has nothing to do
00:39:36,00:39:38,with handkerchiefs.
00:39:38,00:39:40,It's not short for handkerchief-pankerchief.
00:39:40,00:39:42,LAUGHTER
00:39:42,00:39:46,"No, it's not."
00:39:46,00:39:50,Can it be now?
00:39:50,00:39:52,Yeah. I just
00:39:52,00:39:54,imagined Andy going back home to his wife.
00:39:54,00:39:56,Little bit of handkerchief-pankerchief.
00:39:56,00:39:58,LAUGHTER
00:39:58,00:40:04,I'm only wearing 27 layers
00:40:04,00:40:06,"of handkerchiefs tonight, darling."
00:40:06,00:40:08,Oh...
00:40:08,00:40:10,Is there a factor in that?
00:40:10,00:40:12,"Not really, guys."
00:40:12,00:40:14,It's that handkerchief-panky
00:40:14,00:40:16,has nothing to do with sex.
00:40:16,00:40:18,It's completely originally meant juggling
00:40:18,00:40:20,or trickery.
00:40:20,00:40:22,But still nothing to do with handkerchiefs
00:40:22,00:40:24,because you would think...
00:40:24,00:40:26,It's maybe related to hocus-pocus.
00:40:26,00:40:28,"Right. Hocus-pocus, hanky-panky."
00:40:28,00:40:30,"That's a very sleazy magician, sorry."
00:40:30,00:40:32,"Hocus-pocus, hanky-panky."
00:40:32,00:40:34,LAUGHTER
00:40:34,00:40:36,Have you guys heard of the
00:40:36,00:40:38,Valsalva effect?
00:40:38,00:40:40,No. The Valsalva effect
00:40:40,00:40:42,is something that we've probably all done.
00:40:42,00:40:44,"We must have all done this, which is"
00:40:44,00:40:46,when your ears are blocked
00:40:46,00:40:48,"or you're on a plane and you get descending,"
00:40:48,00:40:50,there's action of holding your nose
00:40:50,00:40:52,and holding your mouth
00:40:52,00:40:54,and blowing to get your ears popping.
00:40:54,00:40:56,"That's what you do to equalize as well, isn't it?"
00:40:56,00:40:58,Yeah. So it's the opposite of blowing your nose.
00:40:58,00:41:00,You're sucking in...
00:41:00,00:41:02,You're using the pressure that's shooting inwards.
00:41:02,00:41:04,So that's used for a number of things.
00:41:04,00:41:06,It's for relieving your ears.
00:41:06,00:41:08,It's for people with abnormal heart rhythms.
00:41:08,00:41:10,They use it to relieve chest pain.
00:41:10,00:41:12,They say if you do have
00:41:12,00:41:14,abnormal heart problems that you should always
00:41:14,00:41:16,"consult a doctor before doing that,"
00:41:16,00:41:18,just to make sure that you don't
00:41:18,00:41:20,make the situation worse.
00:41:20,00:41:22,But another thing that it's used for
00:41:22,00:41:24,is for people who suffer from premature ejaculation.
00:41:24,00:41:26,"Oh, really?"
00:41:26,00:41:28,Because I have very bad sinuses
00:41:28,00:41:30,and have...
00:41:30,00:41:32,..and literally do that
00:41:32,00:41:34,"Valsalva effect, I would say about"
00:41:34,00:41:36,20 times a day.
00:41:36,00:41:38,Right.
00:41:38,00:41:40,I don't want to know what person or link you're making
00:41:40,00:41:42,to what bit of get-first is coming.
00:41:42,00:41:44,I want to know what's coming.
00:41:44,00:41:46,Not you.
00:41:46,00:41:52,You manage it.
00:41:52,00:41:54,"Yeah, so pretty exciting, isn't it?"
00:41:54,00:41:56,So you're supposed to do that mid-to-sex?
00:41:56,00:41:58,I think... I couldn't see where they said
00:41:58,00:42:00,"if it was before or during,"
00:42:00,00:42:02,"but I imagine it's during, and I'm not sure"
00:42:02,00:42:04,how you can disguise that as a sexy thing.
00:42:04,00:42:06,"So next time you're having handkerchief,"
00:42:06,00:42:08,handkerchief at home maybe.
00:42:08,00:42:10,Try it out and let us know
00:42:10,00:42:12,if it's before or during that it's required.
00:42:12,00:42:14,"They are sexy things, though, aren't they?"
00:42:14,00:42:16,Handkerchiefs. They were used
00:42:16,00:42:18,for sexy purposes back in the day.
00:42:18,00:42:20,"In the 19th century, there were another one of these things"
00:42:20,00:42:22,where there was a whole language behind handkerchiefs
00:42:22,00:42:24,that lovers could use to convey
00:42:24,00:42:26,messages to each other.
00:42:26,00:42:28,"And there's actually a book, because we've talked before,"
00:42:28,00:42:30,I think about the language of flowers.
00:42:30,00:42:32,"If you sent flowers in a certain arrangement,"
00:42:32,00:42:34,it meant different things.
00:42:34,00:42:36,"Fans, the language of fans."
00:42:36,00:42:38,"If your fan is three-quarters open, it means I'd like a handjob"
00:42:38,00:42:40,but not a blowjob or whatever.
00:42:40,00:42:42,"As you see, the woman with the fan."
00:42:42,00:42:44,"So actually, anyway..."
00:42:44,00:42:46,You're an absolute menace
00:42:46,00:42:48,"in the summer, aren't you, Anna?"
00:42:48,00:42:50,LAUGHTER
00:42:50,00:42:56,"Question one, if you just want to keep cool."
00:42:56,00:42:58,Being pounced on.
00:42:58,00:43:00,There's a book published in 1879
00:43:00,00:43:02,"called ""A Complete Guide"
00:43:02,00:43:04,"to Glertation, Containing Handkerchief,"
00:43:04,00:43:06,"a Glove, Fan and Paracel Flirtations"
00:43:06,00:43:08,and a Complete Language
00:43:08,00:43:10,"of Flowers"". So we have to assume everyone"
00:43:10,00:43:12,"memorized this at the time, so they understood"
00:43:12,00:43:14,what each other was saying.
00:43:14,00:43:16,"But drawing a handkerchief across your forehead,"
00:43:16,00:43:18,do you know what that means?
00:43:18,00:43:20,Sweaty. Yeah.
00:43:20,00:43:22,It either means you're sweating profusely
00:43:22,00:43:24,or it means we are being watched.
00:43:24,00:43:26,Oh.
00:43:26,00:43:28,Don't jump me.
00:43:28,00:43:32,"Across the cheeks was ""I Love You""."
00:43:32,00:43:34,Face cheeks?
00:43:34,00:43:36,LAUGHTER
00:43:36,00:43:38,LAUGHTER
00:43:38,00:43:40,"The face cheeks, yes."
00:43:40,00:43:42,It's worth knowing.
00:43:42,00:43:44,Yeah. It doesn't actually...
00:43:44,00:43:46,"This is where the problems can come, if you don't know."
00:43:46,00:43:48,"I didn't actually note down the arse cheeks one,"
00:43:48,00:43:50,so you'll have to just decide for yourselves.
00:43:50,00:43:52,"Through the hands, if someone, you're talking to someone,"
00:43:52,00:43:54,they'll weave a handkerchief through their hands.
00:43:54,00:43:56,"Oh, yeah. I hate you."
00:43:56,00:43:58,Oh! Really?
00:43:58,00:44:00,It's horrible.
00:44:00,00:44:02,"There was another one later in the 1970s,"
00:44:02,00:44:04,which was in the LGBTQ community.
00:44:04,00:44:06,And you might wear
00:44:06,00:44:08,"different handkerchiefs or bandanas,"
00:44:08,00:44:10,and the colour might tell you what your fetish was.
00:44:10,00:44:12,"So if you're in a club with like-minded people,"
00:44:12,00:44:14,it would tell them what you're thinking.
00:44:14,00:44:16,"Also, cartoon characters tend to wear"
00:44:16,00:44:18,hankies and bandanas around their necks
00:44:18,00:44:20,because necks are quite hard to draw.
00:44:20,00:44:22,"Oh, really?"
00:44:22,00:44:24,"And so... Oh, no."
00:44:24,00:44:26,Fred Flintstone wears a light blue sort of
00:44:26,00:44:28,cloth around his neck.
00:44:28,00:44:30,"Apparently, he's into fallatio."
00:44:30,00:44:32,LAUGHTER
00:44:32,00:44:34,I'll rattle through these.
00:44:34,00:44:36,"Fred from Scooby-Doo,"
00:44:36,00:44:38,"red, fisting, and..."
00:44:38,00:44:40,Oh!
00:44:40,00:44:42,"Captain Pugwash,"
00:44:42,00:44:44,"light cream, rimming."
00:44:44,00:44:46,So...
00:44:46,00:44:48,"It's just if they happen to be in a club,"
00:44:48,00:44:50,then that's what we've got.
00:44:50,00:44:52,Wow.
00:44:52,00:44:56,"OK, it's time for our final fact of the show,"
00:44:56,00:44:58,and that is James.
00:44:58,00:45:01,"OK, my fact this week is that in the 1960s,"
00:45:01,00:45:03,owners of a theme park in Pennsylvania
00:45:03,00:45:05,had guards with plastic bats
00:45:05,00:45:07,in the Tunnel of Love ride
00:45:07,00:45:09,who were instructed to give an admonishing
00:45:09,00:45:11,thwack to any bear bums
00:45:11,00:45:13,that they saw.
00:45:13,00:45:15,LAUGHTER
00:45:15,00:45:17,Cover that with a handkerchief now!
00:45:17,00:45:19,LAUGHTER
00:45:19,00:45:21,So this is a true thing that happened.
00:45:21,00:45:23,"In actual fact, it didn't just happen in Pennsylvania."
00:45:23,00:45:25,It happened in a few different places.
00:45:25,00:45:27,"And when you're saying plastic bats,"
00:45:27,00:45:29,I'm thinking of table tennis bats.
00:45:29,00:45:31,I'm not thinking of a plastic
00:45:31,00:45:33,winged mammal bat.
00:45:33,00:45:35,LAUGHTER
00:45:35,00:45:37,I have seen them. They are table tennis bats.
00:45:37,00:45:39,Nice. Some of them were actually almost in the shape
00:45:39,00:45:41,"of a hand, you know, like one of those big, sort of foam hands."
00:45:41,00:45:43,Yeah.
00:45:43,00:45:45,"It was plastic, and they would whack the bums like that."
00:45:45,00:45:47,"Oh, wow. And it's cos they didn't want people"
00:45:47,00:45:49,making out all worse in their Tunnels of Love.
00:45:49,00:45:51,"No, handkerchief, handkerchief. No."
00:45:51,00:45:53,LAUGHTER
00:45:53,00:45:55,So this was an article.
00:45:55,00:45:57,"Originally, I read this in Mental Floss,"
00:45:57,00:45:59,and I followed it up and found an article
00:45:59,00:46:01,in the Pittsburgh City Paper.
00:46:01,00:46:03,And this is about a place called Kenneword Theme Park.
00:46:03,00:46:05,And there is a ride there called The Old Mill.
00:46:05,00:46:07,It was constructed in 1901.
00:46:07,00:46:09,It's the oldest roller coaster in the whole place.
00:46:09,00:46:11,"And it's one of these, you know, like a log flume,"
00:46:11,00:46:13,"where you're going in the water,"
00:46:13,00:46:15,but there's no up and down bits.
00:46:15,00:46:17,You're just kind of slowly going round in the water.
00:46:17,00:46:19,Yeah.
00:46:19,00:46:21,And there's like things to see on the side.
00:46:21,00:46:23,So there might be scary things.
00:46:23,00:46:25,"There might be skeletons, or there might be sexy things,"
00:46:25,00:46:27,or whatever.
00:46:27,00:46:29,Yeah. Yeah? Yeah.
00:46:29,00:46:31,"Yeah, fair enough."
00:46:31,00:46:33,And then I found this YouTuber
00:46:33,00:46:35,"called Defunctland,"
00:46:35,00:46:37,"and he's done a video on this,"
00:46:37,00:46:39,and it's one of the best videos I've ever seen
00:46:39,00:46:41,in my entire life on YouTube.
00:46:41,00:46:43,It's all about this place.
00:46:43,00:46:45,And he found an article from 1934
00:46:45,00:46:47,saying that this Tunnel of Love
00:46:47,00:46:49,was a really good place for people to make out.
00:46:49,00:46:51,And he found other Tunnels of Love
00:46:51,00:46:53,where people were whacking birdbombs.
00:46:53,00:46:55,"And he asked people,"
00:46:55,00:46:57,"""Have you or anyone you know"
00:46:57,00:46:59,ever kissed
00:46:59,00:47:01,or had sex
00:47:01,00:47:03,on the Tunnel of Love
00:47:03,00:47:05,"in Kennywood?"""
00:47:05,00:47:07,And he tweeted saying that
00:47:07,00:47:09,"""I have received the most explicit,"
00:47:09,00:47:11,disgusting and shocking emails
00:47:11,00:47:13,"I have ever read."""
00:47:13,00:47:15,[laughter]
00:47:15,00:47:17,So this was really...
00:47:17,00:47:19,"And there are newspaper articles from the 30s, 40s, 50s,"
00:47:19,00:47:21,"60s, even, all of them saying"
00:47:21,00:47:23,this is the place to go and make out.
00:47:23,00:47:25,This is where kids make out.
00:47:25,00:47:27,This is so famous for that.
00:47:27,00:47:29,"It's only six minutes long, the ride."
00:47:29,00:47:31,"Four minutes more than I need, buddy."
00:47:31,00:47:33,[laughter]
00:47:33,00:47:35,"Well, I've got a technique with a nose."
00:47:35,00:47:37,[laughter]
00:47:37,00:47:39,I wonder for how many people
00:47:39,00:47:41,"who got slapped on the butt by the ping-pong paddle,"
00:47:41,00:47:43,that turned into
00:47:43,00:47:45,a sort of exciting new fetish that they didn't realise.
00:47:45,00:47:47,I think there might have been a bit of that.
00:47:47,00:47:49,There must have been so many Christmases where
00:47:49,00:47:51,"they were going, ""Yeah, yeah, I've got some ping-pong paddles."
00:47:51,00:47:53,"I don't know, I just want to get into the sport."""
00:47:53,00:47:55,There's no reason.
00:47:55,00:47:57,Can I say something incredibly boring
00:47:57,00:47:59,"about this theme park, Kennywood?"
00:47:59,00:48:01,Yeah.
00:48:01,00:48:03,"So it was a trolley park originally,"
00:48:03,00:48:05,and a few weeks ago on the podcast we mentioned trams.
00:48:05,00:48:07,Yeah.
00:48:07,00:48:09,"That episode hasn't gone out yet,"
00:48:09,00:48:11,but we will have recently mentioned trams.
00:48:11,00:48:13,[laughter]
00:48:13,00:48:15,And what's a trolley park?
00:48:15,00:48:17,"I'm so glad you asked, Dan."
00:48:17,00:48:19,"It is a miniature adventure park,"
00:48:19,00:48:21,"or a park with rides,"
00:48:21,00:48:23,that's put at the end of a trolley line.
00:48:23,00:48:25,"So trolley is just an American word for a tram, basically."
00:48:25,00:48:27,And it was to encourage people
00:48:27,00:48:29,to use the trolley car network at weekends.
00:48:29,00:48:31,"So you would normally use them to get to work,"
00:48:31,00:48:33,"but at the weekend they weren't being used,"
00:48:33,00:48:35,so they put something to attract people.
00:48:35,00:48:37,Exactly.
00:48:37,00:48:39,"And so, sorry, I just thought we were all having so much fun,"
00:48:39,00:48:41,and I just wanted to talk about tram infrastructure.
00:48:41,00:48:43,[laughter]
00:48:43,00:48:45,"No, it's a good pallet cleanser."
00:48:45,00:48:47,Any more on this?
00:48:47,00:48:49,"Well, just one other ride that there was"
00:48:49,00:48:51,"at Kennywood in the early days,"
00:48:51,00:48:53,"which was, sorry, not a ride."
00:48:53,00:48:55,"There was one thing, an attraction called the House of Mystery,"
00:48:55,00:48:57,but no one knows what it was.
00:48:57,00:48:59,[laughter]
00:48:59,00:49:01,That's pretty good.
00:49:01,00:49:03,Did no one ever come out of it?
00:49:03,00:49:05,"It's been lost to history, unfortunately."
00:49:05,00:49:07,"And there was one thing called spring water,"
00:49:07,00:49:09,"which was just a water fountain,"
00:49:09,00:49:11,the stream of water coming from a spring.
00:49:11,00:49:13,"There was a tin cup you could use to get a drink,"
00:49:13,00:49:15,"but you could use the water,"
00:49:15,00:49:17,so that you would just get an electric shock
00:49:17,00:49:19,every time you tried to have a drink.
00:49:19,00:49:21,That was entertainment.
00:49:21,00:49:23,"These rides are tunnels of love,"
00:49:23,00:49:25,which you don't really see much anymore.
00:49:25,00:49:27,"In fact, I don't think I've ever seen one myself,"
00:49:27,00:49:29,a fairground ride or a theme park or whatever.
00:49:29,00:49:31,"There's a few, like, in the UK."
00:49:31,00:49:33,"Yeah, yeah."
00:49:33,00:49:35,But they're basically the equivalent of rides
00:49:35,00:49:37,that we've all seen at parks where you essentially get on them
00:49:37,00:49:39,"when you can't be asked a cue for one of the good rides again,"
00:49:39,00:49:41,"and so you just sit on this really slow, boring boat."
00:49:41,00:49:44,And so they were often haunted rides
00:49:44,00:49:47,"that were converted to tunnels of love or vice versa, weren't they?"
00:49:47,00:49:49,"So I think this one, at Kennywood,"
00:49:49,00:49:51,"went on to become hard-headed Harold,"
00:49:51,00:49:53,"horrendously humorous, haunted hideaway."
00:49:53,00:49:55,That's right.
00:49:55,00:49:57,It sounds like a worse ride.
00:49:57,00:50:00,They also branded it as a Panama Canal.
00:50:00,00:50:02,"So you would go down here,"
00:50:02,00:50:04,and it was this few going along the Panama Canal.
00:50:04,00:50:05,That's great.
00:50:05,00:50:07,"It is, but the Panama Canal is literally just a canal."
00:50:07,00:50:09,There's no fun stuff on either side.
00:50:09,00:50:10,"No, you're right."
00:50:10,00:50:12,"And then in the end,"
00:50:12,00:50:15,it was rebranded as Garfield's Nightmare Ride.
00:50:15,00:50:17,All of these...
00:50:17,00:50:19,Cat. Yeah.
00:50:19,00:50:21,Or President James Garfield.
00:50:21,00:50:23,Who wastes everything through his anus
00:50:23,00:50:25,for the last three months of his life.
00:50:25,00:50:27,Weird ride.
00:50:27,00:50:29,But I want to ride.
00:50:29,00:50:31,"This guy, Defunkland,"
00:50:31,00:50:33,"who did this amazing video,"
00:50:33,00:50:37,"he said that he thinks, after getting all these emails,"
00:50:37,00:50:39,that there are at least two people
00:50:39,00:50:41,who were conceived on that ride.
00:50:41,00:50:43,"Oh, great, really?"
00:50:43,00:50:46,"And Kennywood Theme Park now uses the slogan,"
00:50:46,00:50:48,"""Welcome to the family."""
00:50:48,00:50:50,But that's just a coincidence.
00:50:50,00:50:51,That's okay.
00:50:51,00:50:53,"The Tunnel of Love, really."
00:50:53,00:50:56,"I've read something saying there used to be hundreds,"
00:50:56,00:50:58,as in maybe 700 across the USA.
00:50:58,00:51:01,"Yeah, the USA is big, but that has a lot of Tunnels of Love."
00:51:01,00:51:03,But it all sort of sadly came into an end
00:51:03,00:51:05,because of the sexual revolution.
00:51:05,00:51:07,"Yeah, but that's the thing."
00:51:07,00:51:09,The humanity became liberalised.
00:51:09,00:51:11,So basically you could snog in public.
00:51:11,00:51:13,You didn't have to go into a tunnel.
00:51:13,00:51:15,"And because they were such a shit ride,"
00:51:15,00:51:17,that was really the only good thing about them.
00:51:17,00:51:20,Another strike against the sexual revolution.
00:51:20,00:51:23,Do you guys know what was the fastest way to travel
00:51:23,00:51:25,in the entire world in 1880?
00:51:25,00:51:28,I'm going to say Tunnel of Love.
00:51:28,00:51:31,That is a ridiculous thing to say.
00:51:31,00:51:34,I don't know if everything was slow at the time.
00:51:34,00:51:36,Maybe there was a point in 1880 where all trains broke.
00:51:36,00:51:38,All the horses in the lane.
00:51:38,00:51:40,All the horses died.
00:51:40,00:51:42,Was it?
00:51:42,00:51:44,I'm just kind of...
00:51:44,00:51:46,"Because I know this sneaky man, what he does."
00:51:46,00:51:48,I start seeking.
00:51:48,00:51:50,Was it an underground train system
00:51:50,00:51:52,"that was one of the first of its kind,"
00:51:52,00:51:54,underground in Paris that led to the Louvre?
00:51:54,00:51:57,And so it was the Tunnel of Love.
00:51:57,00:51:59,The Louvre?
00:51:59,00:52:02,He's seeking. He's not the Riddler.
00:52:04,00:52:07,"OK, I'm going to have a pun."
00:52:07,00:52:09,Fastest trains at the time.
00:52:09,00:52:12,"In America, they were only about 30 or 40 miles an hour."
00:52:12,00:52:15,"In the UK, I think we had up to about 60 or 70 miles an hour."
00:52:15,00:52:18,I'm talking about something that was going at 112 miles an hour.
00:52:18,00:52:20,And this was public transport.
00:52:20,00:52:22,It was something you could travel on.
00:52:22,00:52:25,Because if you jump off the Eiffel Tower or something...
00:52:25,00:52:28,I wouldn't say jumping off the Eiffel Tower is transport.
00:52:28,00:52:31,"And in 1880, definitely not."
00:52:31,00:52:34,"Another bad commute, darling."
00:52:34,00:52:36,"OK, no, no, but I think..."
00:52:36,00:52:38,So the Tunnel of Love is a kind of boat ride that you go on.
00:52:38,00:52:41,Is it something like a log flume?
00:52:41,00:52:43,It's exactly a log flume.
00:52:43,00:52:47,So I found an article in the Chicago Herald in 1886
00:52:47,00:52:49,"that told of a group of loggers, right?"
00:52:49,00:52:51,"So they're at the top of a mountain,"
00:52:51,00:52:54,and they created these flumes.
00:52:54,00:52:56,"They were kind of metal flumes,"
00:52:56,00:52:58,"which they would send the logs down,"
00:52:58,00:53:00,"and they would all go down to the bottom,"
00:53:00,00:53:02,and that's where they would process them.
00:53:02,00:53:04,"You cut them at the top, you would send them down."
00:53:04,00:53:06,"Really, really steep."
00:53:06,00:53:08,"Now, at the end of the day,"
00:53:08,00:53:11,all of these workers would get on one of these logs
00:53:11,00:53:13,and fly down.
00:53:13,00:53:15,"OK, there was a quote, and they said,"
00:53:15,00:53:17,"""We all looked at our watches."
00:53:17,00:53:20,"We had made 16 miles in eight minutes and 40 seconds."""
00:53:20,00:53:23,So that is an average speed of 112 miles an hour.
00:53:23,00:53:25,But they did come down there.
00:53:25,00:53:27,It's so terrifying.
00:53:27,00:53:30,"There was a journalist in 1875, I think,"
00:53:30,00:53:33,"who went to report on the Nevada log flumes,"
00:53:33,00:53:35,"and they looked so cool,"
00:53:35,00:53:37,"and there is video footage of the logs going down them,"
00:53:37,00:53:41,"and they were built really high on scaffolding into the air,"
00:53:41,00:53:43,"like 70 feet in the air,"
00:53:43,00:53:46,"and they were these channels, which they zoomed down."
00:53:46,00:53:48,"And yeah, this journalist said,"
00:53:48,00:53:50,"""Does anyone ever go down it?"""
00:53:50,00:53:52,"And they said, ""Yeah, yeah, you can totally do that."""
00:53:52,00:53:54,"Now, I still don't know if the log was on this one,"
00:53:54,00:53:56,"actually did go down it, or they were pranking the journalist,"
00:53:56,00:53:58,"because the journalist said, ""OK, I will."""
00:53:58,00:54:00,"The two owners of the log flume said,"
00:54:00,00:54:03,"""All right, well, if you're doing it, I guess we'll do it."""
00:54:03,00:54:06,And none of the loggers agreed to get in with them.
00:54:06,00:54:09,"And as they pushed him off, one of the loggers shouted,"
00:54:09,00:54:11,"""A flume has no element of safety."
00:54:11,00:54:14,You cannot stop. You cannot lessen your speed.
00:54:14,00:54:16,"You have only to sit still, shut your eyes,"
00:54:16,00:54:19,"say your prayers, and wait for eternity. Bye!"""
00:54:19,00:54:21,Smile for the camera.
00:54:23,00:54:26,"And that's what their log flume rides are based on, those, right?"
00:54:26,00:54:28,"Right, yeah, yeah."
00:54:28,00:54:30,"I think they've all shut down other log flumes,"
00:54:30,00:54:33,but I think there was one operating relatively recently
00:54:33,00:54:35,"in Washington, in the state of Washington,"
00:54:35,00:54:38,"which took an hour to go along, so it might have been a bit slower."
00:54:38,00:54:40,"Yeah, yeah, they weren't all really steep,"
00:54:40,00:54:42,just the ones on mountains were.
00:54:42,00:54:44,Lassie went on that one.
00:54:44,00:54:47,She did an episode of Lassie where Lassie went on a log flume.
00:54:47,00:54:49,"OK, great."
00:54:49,00:54:51,Nice. Good.
00:54:52,00:54:54,She deserves a break.
00:54:54,00:54:56,Is Lassie a she? Yeah.
00:54:56,00:54:58,I didn't know that. Lassie.
00:54:58,00:55:00,"Oh, Lassie."
00:55:00,00:55:04,It's in the name. It is in the name.
00:55:04,00:55:06,Jane Austen could have gone on a log flume.
00:55:06,00:55:08,That's the exciting...
00:55:08,00:55:10,It's one of my main interests is whether Jane Austen
00:55:10,00:55:12,could have done any of the tech we talk about.
00:55:12,00:55:14,So she was alive when...
00:55:14,00:55:17,"But not the ride, the log flume, the actual log flume thing."
00:55:17,00:55:19,A tunneled boat ride.
00:55:19,00:55:22,"This was a ride, actually. It was in France in 1817,"
00:55:22,00:55:24,"which is the year Austen died,"
00:55:24,00:55:26,so she wouldn't have had a great time on it.
00:55:26,00:55:28,What a way to go.
00:55:28,00:55:30,What a way to go.
00:55:30,00:55:32,"She died of something completely sort of ordinary and sad,"
00:55:32,00:55:34,"but if she died on a log flume,"
00:55:34,00:55:36,it would have been perfect.
00:55:36,00:55:39,"It was called the Soet du Niagara Falls,"
00:55:39,00:55:42,and it was a boat which fell down a slope into a basin of water.
00:55:42,00:55:44,"I mean, it's pretty much a classic log flume."
00:55:44,00:55:46,"Anyway, Jane Austen could have..."
00:55:46,00:55:48,I have a Red Mansfield Park. Is that about a theme park?
00:55:48,00:55:50,LAUGHTER
00:55:50,00:55:52,I can't believe you thought of Mansfield Park.
00:55:52,00:55:54,I was going through sense and sensibility.
00:55:54,00:55:56,"No, that doesn't work."
00:55:56,00:55:58,Have you guys heard of...
00:55:58,00:56:01,There's a sex theme park in South Korea called Bloodland.
00:56:01,00:56:03,Have you seen it? No.
00:56:03,00:56:05,It's amazing. We say it's a theme park.
00:56:05,00:56:07,"It's kind of like a sculpture park,"
00:56:07,00:56:10,and it's just lots of penises and lots of people in positions of sex.
00:56:10,00:56:12,"So it's not... You can't ride them, as it were."
00:56:12,00:56:14,There.
00:56:14,00:56:16,"No, I don't think so."
00:56:16,00:56:19,"Yeah, you can... Well, they do say there's a few hands-on exhibits,"
00:56:19,00:56:22,"such as the masturbation cycle,"
00:56:22,00:56:24,which is you basically spin a thing
00:56:24,00:56:28,and you move their hands for them as part of this little exhibit.
00:56:28,00:56:31,It's a statue kind of thing. Right.
00:56:31,00:56:33,"And then there's this really weird thing,"
00:56:33,00:56:35,and I couldn't find anything more about it.
00:56:35,00:56:37,I searched quite a bit. It's this giant...
00:56:37,00:56:40,It's like a five-foot tall see-through penis
00:56:40,00:56:43,"with sort of like computer workings all inside of it,"
00:56:43,00:56:45,"and it's just got a little plaque next to it,"
00:56:45,00:56:48,"and it's got a lot of words in Korean, which obviously I can't read."
00:56:48,00:56:51,"But then there's only one English word on it, as far as I could see,"
00:56:51,00:56:53,"and the word is ""terminator."""
00:56:53,00:56:55,And that's...
00:56:55,00:56:58,"I don't know if they're saying that's his particular penis,"
00:56:58,00:57:04,or if it's a penis of the future coming back to our time to...
00:57:04,00:57:07,"Would he have donated his penis? I haven't seen ""terminator."""
00:57:07,00:57:09,Is that the sort of thing that the character would do?
00:57:09,00:57:12,"Yeah, I'll be back until I'm back. How's this?"
00:57:14,00:57:16,"Yeah, that's on Jeju Island, isn't it?"
00:57:16,00:57:18,Yeah.
00:57:18,00:57:21,"Originally, Jeju Island was like a honeymoon destination,"
00:57:21,00:57:24,"but it was... After the Korean War, there was a lot of arranged marriages,"
00:57:24,00:57:28,"so a lot of the couples had never seen each other or really met each other before,"
00:57:28,00:57:31,"and so they would go to this honeymoon destination,"
00:57:31,00:57:33,and they were really inexperienced.
00:57:33,00:57:35,"They didn't really know what to do,"
00:57:35,00:57:38,and so they had... All the hotels had professional icebreakers
00:57:38,00:57:40,who would kind of sit next to you.
00:57:40,00:57:43,"If you're having dinner at a restaurant and you're being a bit awkward,"
00:57:43,00:57:46,"- you're going to get a sensation again. - God, that's a great idea."
00:57:46,00:57:54,"Sorry, you would be the worst human on earth as an icebreaker."
00:57:54,00:57:57,Did you know there was a trolley system on there?
00:57:57,00:58:01,Where are you going? Come back.
00:58:01,00:58:04,"I'm saying I need one, not that I could be one."
00:58:04,00:58:08,I don't want to talk about traps any more than you do.
00:58:08,00:58:10,It's all I can think of.
00:58:11,00:58:14,Wow. This really is a cry for help.
