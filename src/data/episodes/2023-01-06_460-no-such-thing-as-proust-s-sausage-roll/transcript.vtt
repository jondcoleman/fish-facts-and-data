00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.520
 (upbeat music)

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:03.480
 - Hi everyone, happy new year.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.960
 We have a little favor to ask you

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.240
 before we start with the 2013 episodes

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.800
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish."

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.360
 - 2013 episodes?

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.200
 - Is that not, oh, what year is it?

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.560
 - James, oh my God, this is so sad.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.800
 You've just woken up from a coma

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.120
 and you haven't realized that 10 years have passed.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.920
 - No, no, you mean this is an episode two

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.520
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish"?

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.160
 - I'm so sorry, but you're gonna be delighted

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.760
 with how far we've come in the interim.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.080
 - Wow, well, what have we done while I've been in a coma?

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.680
 Have we told the world?

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.520
 Have we made some books?

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.360
 Have we won any national comedy awards?

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.160
 - Well, do you know, it's funny, you should mention that.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.640
 That's the one thing we haven't quite done yet.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.120
 And we're delighted to have you back.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.720
 We've had to simulate your presence for the last decade.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.160
 Delighted to have you back to help us win them

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.880
 'cause that is what we're supposed to be talking about

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:53.760
 right now.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.160
 It is the national comedy awards

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.640
 and we are on the long list.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.920
 "No Such Thing as a Fish" for best comedy podcast.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.560
 We would absolutely love to get to the shortlist.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.480

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.200

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.960
 So if you don't know who was the best supporting actor

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.680
 in a foreign sitcom this year, then it doesn't matter.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.720

 And we might get nominated for an award.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.160
 I'm going back to sleep.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.240
 Enjoy the show.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.000
 On with the podcast.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.240
 - On with the podcast.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.840
 (upbeat music)

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:51.080
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.780
 (upbeat music)

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:00.080
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.120
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish,"

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.480
 a weekly podcast this week, coming to you live

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.720
 from the Bloomsbury Theater in London.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.000
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.400
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.000
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.400
 And once again, we have gathered round the microphones

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.520
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.280
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.600
 Starting with fact number one, and that is my fact,

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.600
 my fact this week, is that originally Popeye,

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.640
 the sailor man, got his powers, not from eating spinach,

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.380
 but by rubbing a lucky magic hen.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.880
 - I love the fact that you need to specify Popeye,

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.360
 the sailor man.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.800
 Oh, Popeye, that's how Popeye, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.240
 - So this is Popeye, we obviously know the great,

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.640
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.640
 - I think that was the chicken.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.780
 - That was the chicken, was that the chicken?

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:56.960
 - So Popeye the sailor man,

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.040
 and he was a cartoon back in the early 1900s,

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.660
 and when he originally--

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.960
 - And also beyond, if you're remembering Popeye,

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.360
 and thinking, "Shit, am I that old?"

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.120
 He lasted even beyond the early 1900s.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.160
 - I don't know if he's still on TV, he might be,

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.080
 but we all still know him, he's such an iconic character,

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.400
 and obviously he derived all of his powers from spinach,

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.920
 but when the comic strip that he first appeared in

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.920
 was happening, he wasn't a main character,

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.960
 he was this sort of peripheral character

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.920
 who was introduced to the series.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.000
 And there's an episode where he finds himself

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.920
 hired by Olive Oil, who becomes his girlfriend

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.960
 and eventual wife, by her brother who's called Caster Oil,

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.800
 who sails a ship to Dice Island,

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.180
 where he intends to make a lot of money in a casino

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.040
 by rubbing the head of a lucky hen,

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.400
 and when he gets there, Popeye gets shot by someone.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.040
 So the first time we ever see him

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.280
 getting supernatural strength is when after he's shot,

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.240
 this little whiffle hen comes by,

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.920
 and he goes, "Wow, whiffle hen."

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.400
 Don't know how he talks actually, I can't remember.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.240
 There's something like that?

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.080
 - Yeah.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.920
 - Ah, cock, cock, cock.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.160
 And he rubs the hen's head,

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.640
 and then he gets the supernatural power,

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.700
 and he takes out the shooter with some punches,

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.040
 and that's the very first moment.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.080
 - It was a comic strip, right?

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.920
 - Yeah, it was a comic strip.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.840
 - So we wouldn't have known how he spoke, I guess.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.320
 It was just, "Whatever's in your head is how he spoke."

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.160
 - That's a very nice thought.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.360
 Isn't there an American restaurant called Popeyes?

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.200
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.040
 - Isn't there a chicken restaurant?

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:17.880
 - Oh yeah.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.640
 I go in there, rubbing their chickens.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.240
 (laughing)

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.080
 - You've been told.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.560
 - Spinnich didn't come in until quite a lot later,

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.400
 did it?

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.240
 - It was a few years later, yeah.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.680
 - I think it was 1932.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.520
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.600
 - And Popeye, like you say,

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.400
 I think this comic book series started in the teens,

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.160
 the mid teens, 15 or 16,

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.560
 but I think Popeye became the main character

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.560
 in the early 20s.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.040
 So until then, I think he was just relying

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.320
 on normal strength.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.160
 - Well, he's very strong.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.320
 I mean, he's very strong normally,

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.120
 but when he has a spirit, he gets extra strong.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.760
 That's the whole point of those forearms, you know.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:47.600
 - Yes.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.440
 - Well, wait a minute,

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.640
 because your biceps are what make you strong.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.400
 - This has always been the bewildering thing about Popeye.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.440
 - So he's got massive forearms,

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.800
 and the muscles in your forearms

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.480
 are the ones that control your fingers.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.320
 So he's just a brilliant pianist.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.800
 (laughing)

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.720
 - Well, don't do a thumb war with Popeye,

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.160
 is what you're saying?

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.240
 I did not know that Popeye was Jewish.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.080
 Is he?

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.920
 - Popeye was Jewish.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:09.760
 Popeye was Jewish.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:10.640
 So Elsie Seagal was the original cartoonist

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:11.480
 who drew Popeye.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.520
 He was Jewish and there was a lot of,

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.440
 there were a lot of sort of very, very subtle Jewish references

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.120
 and sort of jokes in the strip.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.320
 Yeah, and to such an extent that in Fascist Italy,

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.120
 'cause the cartoon was popular across the world.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.600
 It was so, so popular.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.000
 When it appeared in Fascist Italy,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.720
 the creator's name, Seagal, was taken off it,

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.320
 because they were pessimistic and so, you know, so, yeah, yeah.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.960
 But they still had to have the Popeye.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.760
 - Are you saying Popeye the sailor was Jewish

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.280
 or that Seagal was Jewish?

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.120
 - Well, Seagal was Jewish and there are lots of references.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.880
 It's a very sort of Jewish inflected

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.160
 and influenced cartoon.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.200
 There's no actual scene of Popeye, you know,

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.640
 having Yom Kippur or whatever.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.200
 (laughing)

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.040
 - That's amazing.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.040
 'Cause weirdly, later on in the Popeye run,

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.920
 there was a thing where the original animators

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.080
 were no longer animating it and it was outsourced

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.800
 and it was outsourced to Prague

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.080
 in order for them to make the cartoon.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.200
 So there was a whole series

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.760
 where Tom and Jerry was made in Prague and so on.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.720
 And none of the animators out there had seen it.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.640
 And this was because there was no money to do it.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.040
 So there was a run of 13 episodes,

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.120
 which are often called the worst 13 episodes.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.960
 - Of Popeye?

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.120
 - Of Tom and Jerry because no one had really seen it.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.680
 But Popeye was done there as well.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.480
 But the thing was, all of the people,

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.560
 this is a credits thing, who animated in Prague,

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.240
 had to have their names changed to American names

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.640
 because they didn't want audiences

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.760
 thinking a communist country at the time

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.000
 was infiltrating communist ideas

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.800
 into their Popeye and Tom and Jerry cartoon.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.760
 - Also, isn't it landlocked, Chair Republic?

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.920
 So like, how would you have a sailor man there?

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.440
 - Oh, I guess in land waterways, can I?

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.280
 - The Danube.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.160
 - The Danube, yeah, canal-based.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.560
 - Popeye, Danube, man.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.400
 - Yeah.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.520
 Well, Mongolia has a navy, doesn't it, as well,

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.600
 despite being landlocked.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.440
 - It does, yeah.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.280
 And Bolivia as well.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.520
 - And Bolivia, yeah.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.800
 - Captain Von Trapp is in the sound of music.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.640
 He's a, is he an admiral or something?

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.880
 Or a captain in the navy of the landlocked Austria?

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.400
 - It makes more sense if you're going to have a sailor man

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.480
 to have him on a coast, in a coastal country.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.320
 - It's weird.

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.680
 You know how we normally try and blow shit wide open?

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.640
 We seem to have closed shit wide shut there.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.480
 - Yeah.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.320
 - I like it.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.160
 - That's what we should do.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.000
 Closed shit wide shut.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.320
 (laughing)

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.280
 - Just on chicken rubbing, specifically,

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.400
 there is an Orthodox Jewish ritual called kapparot,

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.880
 where you wave a rooster over someone's head,

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.160
 and you say a particular prayer,

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.640
 and then you slaughter the rooster,

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.120
 and you get the slaughtered rooster to charity,

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.080
 and it's an atonement ritual for whoever's having the

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:35.920
 chicken waver over there.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:36.760
 - Do you rub it on their heads,

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:37.600
 or your own head?

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.680
 - I don't think you rub it specifically.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.800
 You just sort of waft it around above them.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.280
 But maybe, maybe the Wiffelhen is a very subtle reference

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.800
 to the traditional Jewish kapparot ritual.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.640
 - Yeah, it could be.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.440
 - It's almost certainly not.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.000
 - There's also, there was an old English bit of folklore

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.320
 where if you wanted to stop your baby

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.200
 from getting chicken pox, you would rub it with a chicken.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.040
 (laughing)

00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.240
 So it could have been that.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:00.080
 - Right.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:00.920
 - Yeah?

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:01.760
 I'm so glad we're on chicken rubbing stuff,

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.640
 'cause I actually did quite a lot of...

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:04.480
 - Chicken rubbing, right.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.400
 - I can feel a personal anecdote coming up.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.640
 (laughing)

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.960
 So chickens will sometimes flirt with each other

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.320
 by rubbing themselves on the ground.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.160
 - Okay.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.000
 - So like, yeah, yeah.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.880
 So there's this thing called preening oil,

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.240
 which comes out of a kind of gland above the beak.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.760
 And it contains lots of information about the birds' genes

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.240
 and about it, you know, how suitable it is

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.320
 as a mate and things like that.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:29.000
 And so sometimes a cockerel will wipe itself

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.480
 on the ground, for example,

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.880
 to just show it didn't leave it sent

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:33.720
 for a prospective mate.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.440
 - Like a genome sequencing act.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.640
 It leaves its genome sequence on the ground

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.400
 for the male to look at and say,

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.920
 "Oh, you're not prone to sickle cell anemia.

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:42.760
 Thank God."

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:43.760
 (laughing)

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.440
 - Yeah, I guess so, yeah.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.320
 - The Etruscans used to rub chickens.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.120
 - So glad we're doing all this chicken rubbing stuff,

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.600
 'cause this is great.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.440
 Go on, go on.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.480
 - So the Etruscans, and then the Romans after them,

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.120
 but they used chickens for divination.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.120
 They thought they were kind of quite holy.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.240
 And for good luck, you would get a chicken.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.720
 It was always a dead chicken that you would rub,

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.040
 but you would rub it for good luck.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.120
 And that's probably where we get the idea

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.480
 of the wishbone from these guys as well.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:10.640
 You know, like, if you cook a chicken, you get the bone out.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.000
 People used to rub those little bones for luck as well.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:13.840
 - Wow.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:14.680
 - And that's why we do that.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:15.880
 - And now we just snap 'em.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.040
 - Now we just snap 'em.

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.080
 - Rub it too hard.

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:21.120
 You don't want that to happen in most rubbing situations.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.440
 - So they get snapped.

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.440
 (laughing)

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.680
 - The hen in Popeye.

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:28.480
 Sorry to stop us from talking about.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.120
 I've just got one more chicken rubbing paste.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:31.960
 - Of course you do.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:32.800
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:33.640
 No, no, please get it out.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:34.880
 I'd hate for the...

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:39.000
 - Listener to miss out on your golden research.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.960
 - Appalachian chicken rubbing rituals,

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.360
 and I just thought that would be a nice thing.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.480
 So there are lots of Kentucky waltz superstitions.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.720
 You know, when you have a waltz.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.560
 - Right, yeah.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.200
 - I don't know what Kentucky waltz is though.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.840
 It's deep fried, isn't it?

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.400
 (laughing)

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.600
 - There are so many traditions or superstitions

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.720
 about what you do with your waltz

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.240
 to make it disappear in Kentucky specifically.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.360
 Yeah, so, I mean, it's mostly rubbed something on it.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.720
 So, you know, it might be a chicken gizzard

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:03.840
 or a chicken intestine,

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.440
 but also bacon rind,

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:06.280
 or beef steak,

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.440
 or one bean,

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.280
 or three beans.

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.880
 - Just don't accidentally rub two beans

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:13.720
 on it, whatever you do.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:14.560
 - Oh, no, no.

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:15.400
 - Then you come out and waltz.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.080
 - You get double waltz, yeah, yeah.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.280
 Kill a cat.

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.360
 That's bad stuff.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.040
 Take it to a graveyard at midnight,

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.520
 and then rub the cat on the waltz,

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.120
 and also it gets rid of the waltz.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.080
 - It feels like you go with a one bean.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.120
 (laughing)

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.040
 - It's a sort of step change process.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.560
 You know, you try one bean out of three beans,

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.880
 then you kill a cat and take it to a graveyard.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.760
 (laughing)

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:37.920
 Anyway.

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.200
 - You were gonna say on Popeye's chicken.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.040
 - Sorry, Popeye, yeah.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.640
 - I wanted to drag it back to Popeye, apparently.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:42.480
 - No, no, no, that's fine.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.520
 Let's do more rubbing chickens.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:44.360
 What else you got?

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.240
 - Oh, sure, thank you, Dad.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.240
 Well, okay, back, back, back, back.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.640
 Sorry, my mistake.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.200
 No, so in the cartoon,

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.720
 we've got this mystical chicken,

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:52.560
 but it's not the only--

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:53.400
 - In the comic strip, you mean?

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.240
 - Sorry, in the comic strip,

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:57.200
 and it's not the only animal in the comic strip

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.520
 that had these sort of paranormal mystical powers.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:02.880
 There was also a dog called Eugene the Jeep.

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:06.560
 And this was in a 1936 Thimble Theater comic strip,

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:07.840
 and that's what Popeye was part of.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.880
 - I don't think he was a dog per se.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.000
 He looked like a dog.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.520
 - We don't fully know what he was,

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:14.600
 and it led to one of the most existential,

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.640
 brilliant comic strips that I think the creator ever wrote.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.840
 The headline of it was, "What's a Jeep?"

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.200
 Eugene the Jeep, what's a Jeep?

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.640
 And this is what the comic strip for kids said,

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.200
 "A Jeep is an animal living in a three-dimensional world,

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.440
 "in this case, our world,

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:30.080
 "but really belongs to a fourth-dimensional world."

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:30.920
 Here's what happened.

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.080
 A number of Jeep life sails were somehow forced

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.760
 through a dimensional barrier into our world.

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.200
 They combined at a favorable time

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.800
 with the life cells of the African hooey hound.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.320
 The electrical vibrations of that hooey hound cell

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.680
 and the foreign cell were the same.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.240
 They are a kind of kindred cell.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.520
 In fact, all things are to some extent relative,

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:50.080
 whether they be this or some other world.

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.360
 Now you see.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.960
 (audience laughing)

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.200
 For what, for six-year-olds, that is.

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.080
 He was based on a Polish person, wasn't he?

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.520
 Which again, Popeye was,

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.160
 which I imagine they'd have had to cover up

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:04.240
 when they wanted there to be

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.040
 none of these communist influences.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.760
 But this guy sounds like a bit of a legend.

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:12.880
 Frank "Rocky" Fiegel, who was from Segar's hometown.

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.200
 So he lived in Chester, Illinois,

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.080
 which is where Segar came from.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:18.400
 But his parents were Polish immigrants.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.720
 And there's one remaining photo of him,

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:23.720
 and he does look like Popeye, but it's very hard to tell

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.560
 'cause he's basically got a pipe

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:26.880
 and he's bald.

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:27.720
 And so--

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.640
 - I think he definitely looks like Popeye.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:30.720
 - He looks like Popeye,

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.920
 and he was constantly getting into fights,

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.200
 and, which basically is what Popeye does, right?

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.360
 He smokes, he gets into fights.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.800
 - Well, he was a boxer, wasn't he, I think?

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.720
 - He was a boxer, but and a nice guy, though.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:42.200
 Constantly starting fights,

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.520
 but a nice guy and always protected the children.

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.080
 - We're talking about the sailor now, right?

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.640
 - We're talking about Fiegel, the sailor.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.120
 And apparently, according to his biographies--

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.320
 - Sorry, that Popeye is a sailor as well.

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:55.480
 - Oh, sorry, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.360
 - He did actually say at the very start,

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.120
 "Popeye the sailor."

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:02.560
 - Quite specifically, you see why I added it now, Andy.

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.240
 - And actually, this guy wasn't a sailor.

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.360
 - The Polish-- what?

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.480
 - No, he wasn't a sailor.

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.400
 He was just a down and up guy.

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.360
 - So just a guy who liked getting into fights

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.360
 is the inspiration.

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:12.200
 - Yeah, okay.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.120
 - Maybe he didn't spend so much time

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:16.080
 checking out a rubbing chicken patch, you know?

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.760
 - But he used to get sent money, apparently.

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:20.280
 His assistant, Seagal's assistant,

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.680
 said they used to send him a little bit of money

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.040
 to say thanks for inspiring the character of Popeye.

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:24.880
 - Wow.

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:28.800
 - Seagal said this to the Randolph County Herald newspaper

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.280
 that it was based on this guy.

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:31.680
 And there was another person in the town

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:34.600
 called John William Shushet,

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:37.480
 who was supposedly what Wimpy was based on.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:38.320
 - Oh, yeah.

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:39.160
 - So you know Wimpy, the character

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:42.000
 who's, "I gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today,"

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:42.840
 and all that.

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.760
 He's always in debt and he's always eaten hamburgers.

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.720
 And according to this historian,

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:50.000
 John William Shushet also liked hamburgers.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.560
 - Interesting.

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:53.080
 - Open and shut case.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:54.800
 - Shut this shit in my clothes.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.640
 (audience laughing)

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.640
 - His name means joke, sweetly.

00:13:58.640 --> 00:13:59.480
 - Seagal.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.320
 - Or figure.

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.160
 - Oh, yeah.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:02.000
 - His name is prank or joke.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:02.840
 - Oh, yeah.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.680
 - Which is kind of what Popeye is.

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:05.520
 - That was pretty funny.

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:06.360
 - A comic strip.

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:09.440
 - Well, there is a serious point behind Popeye.

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:11.720
 So there was a psychoanalytic piece done about him

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.760
 in an American paper in 1932.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.720
 This is a paper called The Post Dispatch.

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.840
 It was a really, really famous paper at the time.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:18.880
 You may not realize it,

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.800
 but Popeye is a suppressed desire.

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:23.880
 He personifies the desire most of us have

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:26.360
 both to be strong and to sock

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:29.480
 some of the unpleasant people we encounter.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:33.120
 A desire suppressed because we lack Popeye's muscles.

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:34.960
 (audience groans)

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:36.680
 - Although Popeye himself says

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:39.920
 he would never hit anyone as hard as he could

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:41.480
 'cause it's wrong to kill people.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:43.280
 There's actually quite a sweet.

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:45.200
 - Wait, there's the cartoon character now.

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.400
 - Yeah, yeah, the cartoon character.

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:48.240
 - Okay, okay.

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.080
 - The cartoon character wrote a letter

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:51.680
 to a paper in the 1930s saying,

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:53.960
 and I suppose Seagull probably helped him write it,

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.040
 saying he'd never hit anyone as hard as he could

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.160
 because it's wrong to kill people.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.460
 And he said he's been shot 120 times,

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:00.600
 but when bullets go through him,

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:01.920
 it doesn't bother him at all,

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:03.960
 except that he always has to block up the hole

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:05.520
 with a cork 'cause he doesn't like drafts

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:06.600
 blowing through him.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:07.560
 (audience laughs)

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:08.400
 - Beautiful.

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.640
 - Yeah, people complained about the fighting

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:12.840
 'cause it was teaching kids to fight.

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.880
 So after that, he carried on fighting,

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:18.160
 but only for the honor of old ladies and children.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.840
 Later strips.

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.920
 - Children have honor.

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.600
 (audience laughs)

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:24.640
 - Yeah.

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:26.400
 - I guess so, original honor.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:27.240
 - All right, yeah.

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.080
 - Old babies have.

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:31.080
 - But he was really positive for spinach eating at the time.

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:31.920
 - Yeah.

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.800
 - There were reports, and I don't know how accurate they were,

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.120
 but during the Great Depression,

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.440
 they said that the uptake in children

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.900
 who were interested in eating food like spinach,

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:42.040
 well, specifically spinach, was 33%.

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:45.060
 And that bumped it up to sort of like the third most

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:47.760
 requested food or favorite food of a child during that time.

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:50.840
 - Yeah, the insane claim is that there was a survey done

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.520
 which asked children what they liked to eat.

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:54.760
 Their first thing was turkey,

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.000
 and their second thing was ice cream,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.600
 and then they claimed spinach.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.440
 - Yeah.

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:00.480
 - So it was seems very important.

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:01.800
 (audience laughs)

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:04.480
 - And then Popeye later on in the cartoons,

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:07.280
 he stopped eating the spinach directly out of the can.

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:09.520
 So you know he would like squeeze the can in the,

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.680
 but apparently they were worried that children

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:14.000
 might copy this and might get a can of spinach

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.840
 and eat directly from it and cut their mouth.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:16.680
 - Oh, really?

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:17.760
 - Yeah.

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:18.720
 - Yeah, that's the kind of thing I would have done,

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.760
 actually, I think that's fair.

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.400
 - I need to move us on to our next comment.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.520
 - Can we mention very quickly the madness of the film,

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:28.200
 Popeye, which is just one thing about it.

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.280
 So there's the Robin Williams film, 1980,

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.120
 and it's not very good, apparently.

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:32.960
 I haven't seen it.

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:33.800
 - It's absolutely brilliant.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:34.640
 I've seen it five times.

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:35.600
 It's really good.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:38.320
 It's a classic, Robin Williams' first film.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.160
 It's amazing.

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:40.000
 - Yeah, agreed.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:40.840
 It's great.

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:41.680
 - It's mad.

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:42.520
 - All right, it's two against one.

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:43.340
 - It's insane.

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:44.180
 - But I have better taste.

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:46.000
 No, I haven't seen it, so it might be great.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.720
 But anyway, the crazy thing about it

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:48.880
 is what it was like to film it.

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:50.920
 So the producer was a guy called Robert Evans.

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:52.320
 Everyone who worked tonight admits

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.520
 that they were basically rolling in cocaine

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:56.240
 the entire time.

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.800
 And at one point,

00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.560
 and they were all bringing cocaine on set,

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:01.000
 they'd open up like camera packs

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.080
 and just cocaine would fall out of cameras.

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.320
 - I haven't seen this film either,

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:06.280
 but is that what he does instead of spinach?

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:07.120
 - Yeah.

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:08.360
 - Yes, it is, yeah.

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:13.280
 And Robert Evans had some luggage that was full of cocaine

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:15.720
 that he was bringing with him to the set.

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:17.120
 And it went missing at the airport,

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.360
 as bags sometimes do.

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:20.040
 And he thought, oh, shit.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.360
 A, we're not gonna get our Coke.

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:23.920
 And B, if someone finds that luggage, I'm in trouble.

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:26.760
 And so what he did was he basically

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:28.960
 convinced the Maltese Prime Minister at the time,

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.640
 a guy called Dominic Mintoff,

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.760
 to do an exhaustive search of basically the country

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:35.560
 to try and find his bags.

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.600
 And so Mintoff said, "Why on earth would I do that?"

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:39.480
 And he said, "Ah, well, I'm very good friends

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:40.760
 "with Henry Kissinger,

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:43.040
 "and Kissinger's written you a personal note,

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:45.080
 "which is inside that luggage."

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:46.920
 And I'd really love to give it to you.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:48.800
 So it's really important that we track it down

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.560
 so you can read his lovely letter.

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:52.040
 So he did.

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:53.600
 His ego was flattered enough.

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:54.680
 He tracked it down for him.

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:56.480
 And then immediately, as soon as he'd done it,

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.680
 Robert Evans had to fly back to the US,

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:00.680
 meet up with Henry Kissinger,

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.200
 and say, "Look, Henry, I'm so sorry,

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.320
 "but you have to write a fake letter

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:07.080
 "to the leader of Malta,

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.720
 "saying what a great guy he is.

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:12.040
 "Long story short, cocaine luggage situation.

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:14.080
 "Do you mind?"

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:15.800
 And Kissinger was very reluctant,

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.640
 'cause Mintoff was an ally of Gaddafi.

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:18.920
 It would have been very weird for him

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.200
 to write an affectionate letter,

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:24.440
 but he capitulated to save the shit/good film.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.000
 He wrote a fake letter.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:26.840
 Did he really?

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.440
 Well, it sounds like he wrote... just wrote a letter.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:29.280
 He wrote a letter.

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:31.120
 If you're Henry Kissinger and you are writing a letter,

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:31.960
 that's a letter.

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.720
 I guess it's fake. He backdated it.

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:34.720
 Oh, OK, that is fake.

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.520
 Oh, yeah, that's because I did a fakery.

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:38.160
 It's mad.

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.680
 I've just got a few more facts about chicken rubbing.

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.000
 We don't have time, Andy.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.120
 MUSIC

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:49.760
 It is time for fact number two,

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:52.320
 and that is Anna.

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.680
 My fact this week is that Marcel Proust

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:58.720
 once woke up the members of a famous string quartet at midnight

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:00.720
 and made them all come back to his house

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.520
 to play a specific piece for him.

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:05.960
 Because he... Oh, wow, that's so cool.

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:09.120
 It's such a cool thing to be able to do.

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.880
 And this is before he was even really famous.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.800
 How did he do that?

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:17.000
 He just, I guess, people were more willing to do shit

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 back in the day.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.760
 It was sort of pre-telephones, right, this period?

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:21.760
 Yeah, you know...

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.000
 Not everyone's got a telephone.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.600
 Well, no one's calling them.

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:25.960
 Yeah, he's going around to their house.

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:28.280
 Yeah, so four individual houses in the middle of the night

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:29.200
 to wake them up.

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:31.480
 It's 11 p.m. He loved chamber music.

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:33.600
 It's crazier than the Kissinger letter, I think.

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.280
 I don't know how you would organise that.

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:38.600
 Basically, at 11 p.m. he thought,

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:43.800
 "I'd love to listen to César Franc's String Quartet in D Major.

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.280
 "And nothing will stop me."

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:49.120
 And so he knocked on the door of the leading French violinist

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:51.000
 in Paris at the time, Gaston Poulet,

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.400
 who was in his pyjamas and answered the door.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:56.520
 And Proust said, "I've got a taxi waiting downstairs.

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.040
 "We're going to pick up your three mates

00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:59.400
 "and you're going to play me this piece."

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.080
 And so, yeah, he went around all their houses.

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:03.560
 One of them, the violist, was sceptical, apparently,

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:05.200
 because Proust was...

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.720
 He was wrapped in a big blanket

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.520
 and he was eating mashed potato.

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:12.680
 The whole time, in his cab.

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:14.120
 But they all got in.

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.840
 Proust had a very weird life.

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:16.840
 Shall we just say, Proust is...

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:17.840
 Lots of new years, yeah.

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:20.560
 So, author of one of the greatest,

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:23.640
 certainly one of the longest novels ever written,

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:26.520
 Alasherst de Tompeh do in Search of Lost Time.

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:29.560
 And, you know, that's about it.

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:31.160
 All that was his main thing,

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.240
 because he spent a long time writing it and then he died.

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:36.000
 And a huge eccentric in that he...

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.800
 His eccentricities were sort of half-born out

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:39.520
 of the illnesses that he had in his life.

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:43.120
 But he famously wrote all these books in bed.

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.760
 He rarely went to sleep.

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.240
 He was allergic to dust.

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.400
 He was allergic to so many things.

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:50.280
 He had cork walls on his room at home

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:53.680
 because he tried to keep out any allergies from getting to him.

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.600
 He had really bad asthma, didn't he,

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.640
 which he took cigarettes for.

00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.320
 Yeah. Classic.

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:02.040
 I've already had up to ten asthma attacks a day,

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:03.560
 each one lasting up to an hour.

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:04.640
 Yeah. Wow.

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.800
 It's unbelievable that he wrote one of the longer books ever written,

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:09.080
 considering how much time he just spent having asthma, basically.

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:10.760
 Yeah. But that was the thing.

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:12.880
 By then, you would get these cigarettes,

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.600
 and they would have, like, opium in them and stuff.

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:16.280
 So, you know, they weren't that bad,

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:18.440
 but they were going into your lungs.

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:20.840
 But, yeah. And you said about telephones, Dan.

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:22.680
 So, it was... They did have telephones, then.

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:24.320
 They weren't, obviously, super popular,

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:27.280
 but it was a time... Do you remember we talked about this music

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:29.440
 that used to play through the telephone?

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.360
 Yeah, that's right. In America, the... Yeah.

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:32.720
 It's like the first Spotify, in a way.

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:35.240
 Exactly. They had this in France, and Proust had it,

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.400
 because he was in bed the whole time. Wow.

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:41.400
 And so, he had this kind of wires set up to an earpiece,

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.000
 and he would listen to music.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.880
 So, hang on. When you woke up the members of the String Quartet,

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:49.280
 he literally had functioning opera coming into his room.

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.320
 It wasn't that functioning, to be honest.

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:54.600
 Like, there was one time when there was a really loud crowd,

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.600
 and he thought that that was the song,

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:58.560
 because you couldn't really tell what was happening.

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.520
 So, everyone was cheering. He was, "Oh, that was beautiful."

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:03.040
 And they were like, "No, no, that wasn't the song."

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:05.360
 But this was called the Theatrophon,

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:07.480
 and it was very popular in France at the time.

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:09.720
 Also very popular in Budapest.

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:14.600
 And there was Harper's Weekly said that this system in Budapest

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:18.480
 had made it the city that was full of illiterate, blind, bedridden

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:21.360
 and incurably lazy people,

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:24.040
 because they were all at home just listening to this music.

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:25.360
 That feels like quite a personal...

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:27.240
 That's a bit of a sub-tweet on Proust himself, isn't it?

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:29.920
 I mean, that's what he was... Well, it was a little bit, yeah.

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:32.920
 I think they were more slugging off the entire city of Budapest.

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:33.920
 Oh, yeah.

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:39.920
 So, Proust's sort of habits when he was writing.

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:41.600
 So, he went to bed in 1909,

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:44.680
 and he basically stayed there until 19... I think, 22?

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.200
 22, I think he's 19.

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:49.000
 And he wrote for 13 years, and one of his...

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.040
 And also, he couldn't get a publisher.

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:53.360
 He wrote the first volume, really struggled to get it published.

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:54.920
 No publishers were interested.

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:58.360
 He had to self-publish it, you know, at his own expense.

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:01.600
 I think he inherited quite a lot of money, so he was quite well-healed.

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:05.120
 And there was one person who believed in him and championed the work

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:08.240
 and wrote a lot of brilliant, you know, reviews saying,

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:11.440
 "You have to read this author. He is changing the face of literature."

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:17.280
 And that person was Marcel Proust, under an assumed name.

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:18.280
 Really?

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:21.080
 He paid for his own early reviews in lots of newspapers.

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:22.720
 Yeah, he wrote them in longhand,

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.760
 and then he secretly had them typed up by his publisher,

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:26.120
 so there was no paper trail.

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:29.080
 And he described his own work as a little masterpiece.

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:33.720
 He said, "What Monsieur Proust sees and feels is completely original."

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:39.040
 I always think of it as the French trying to get one up on the British and Irish,

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:42.680
 because I feel like we have James Joyce,

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:46.600
 and there's this impenetrable, you know, 1,000-plus-page tome

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:50.080
 that we all attempt to get through at some point and then mostly fail.

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:52.560
 And then they have Proust, where they just did that.

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:56.080
 And then he wrote six more volumes, exactly the same on top of it.

00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:01.400
 Well, I think Proust came first, or certainly his first book was published before Joyce.

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:04.520
 Because, like Candy says, it was self-published,

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:08.120
 but he went to a publisher to try and get it published,

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:10.400
 this guy called Gaston Gallimard.

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:14.160
 And Gallimard passed it on to a reader, and the reader just, it was really long,

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:17.160
 so he just opened it up on a random page, page 62,

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:21.440
 and what he found was a boring and overwritten description of a cup of herbal tea.

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:22.960
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:27.200
 So he declined it, and then Proust had to do the self-publishing thing.

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:30.480
 But then, 10 years later, Gallimard got another novel.

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:34.400
 It was a very long Irish novel, and it was James Joyce's Ulysses, so...

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:36.560
 Because I already regretted it for years,

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:37.920
 like the guy who turned down the Beatles.

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:40.560
 He apologized, yeah, he did apologize afterwards, yeah.

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:41.600
 They did meet once.

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:42.560
 Proust and James Joyce.

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:45.000
 Yeah, 1922, it was the year that he died.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.120
 But it was one of the few times he actually went out, I think,

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:50.280
 and he went to a dinner party, and James Joyce was there.

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:52.880
 And then all I know is, I think James Joyce got quite pissed

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:55.120
 and tried to invite himself back to Proust's house,

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:57.320
 and Proust had to sneak away.

00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:59.080
 But do you have more detail?

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.680
 Well, all I've read about the encounter

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.680
 is that they hadn't actually read each other's books.

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:04.280
 Oh, yeah, really?

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:06.880
 One of the counter of two of the greatest minds ever.

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:08.080
 They had nothing to say.

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:09.080
 That's so funny.

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.600
 There was a guy, before he wrote his mega series of books,

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.760
 he translated a couple of books, and Ruskin,

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:15.920
 he was a huge fan of Ruskin, right?

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:17.480
 And when Ruskin passed away,

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:20.200
 Proust decided that he wanted to make French translations

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:23.680
 of two of the books, except he didn't speak any English.

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:26.440
 So he had to ask his mum to translate it for him.

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:28.520
 And then he did a proper, better translation

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:30.640
 of his mum's translation of the book.

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:33.800
 Oh, my God, he bloody loved his mum.

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:36.120
 My God, if anyone's a mummy's boy.

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:38.840
 Yeah, 'cause he lived with his parents until they both died,

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:40.240
 which is fine.

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:42.840
 And he used to write letters to his mum from bed

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:46.120
 when he couldn't sleep saying, you know, "Mother, I'm so sorry,

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:47.960
 "I won't be able to get up and spend breakfast with you,

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:49.520
 "and nothing would make me happier."

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:52.480
 2,000 pages later, he won't get to the point.

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.320
 But his dad was quite strange,

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.760
 and subjected him to this quite strange experience

00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:58.480
 when he was about 16,

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:02.200
 which was that he was very worried about his son,

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:04.920
 Marcel's masturbation, and...

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:06.760
 Too much, not enough, yeah.

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:08.520
 I just didn't think he was doing enough.

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:10.720
 Doing it weird.

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:12.160
 I thought you'd have this fact.

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:14.000
 Love the rubbing cock facts.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.600
 (LAUGHTER)

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:21.680
 There were no chickens involved,

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:25.240
 but he was a doctor, Dr. Adrian Proust,

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:28.280
 and it was a time when people thought masturbation was bad,

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:32.840
 and Dr. Proust thought that it could lead to homosexuality,

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:34.400
 'cause Proust was gay, in fact,

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:36.040
 and so I think that his parents might have thought,

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:38.000
 "Oh, God, we think he might be gay."

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.120
 And so they said to cure him when he was 16.

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:43.440
 His dad gave him 10 francs, sent him to a brothel,

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:46.160
 and said, "Here you go, have sex with a prostitute,

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:50.760
 "at female, please, and that will stop this awful masturbation habit."

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:52.640
 -10 francs? -Yeah.

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:56.120
 -So much that, is it? I don't know. -Well, back in the day,

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:57.760
 you're not going to splash out on the first experience,

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:01.960
 'cause it's got nothing to do with it. -Don't be disgusting, Anna.

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.080
 Well, speaking of which he didn't, it was a failure.

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:05.320
 This is why we know about it,

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:09.360
 'cause Marcel Proust wrote a letter to his grandfather the next day,

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:13.200
 saying, "I'm really sorry, I need to borrow 13 francs off you.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:17.280
 "Papa gave me 10 francs so I can get rid of this dreadful masturbation habit.

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:19.200
 "But what I did was I turned up,

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:23.280
 "I broke the prostitute's three franc chamber pot, embarrassing,

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:25.960
 "and then I was so embarrassed that I couldn't perform,

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:28.080
 "and so now I need to go back and try again,

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:30.680
 "but I also need to pay her for her chamber pot."

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:33.680
 -So... -Amazing.

00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:35.160
 Poor guy.

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:41.000
 We have this impression of him as very sort of ill and constantly retiring to his bed.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.760
 -He did once fight a duel in his life. -Oh, yeah.

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:46.240
 Yeah, and it was clearly something that mattered to him a lot.

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:51.280
 He fought a duel when someone accused him of being gay, of having had a gay affair.

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:54.680
 And his accuser was a literary critic who was called Jean Lorraine,

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:59.320
 who was also gay, so to be clear, this is two gay guys having a duel

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:01.760
 because one of them said to the other, "You are gay."

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:06.120
 -Yeah. -And they both survived, didn't they?

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:09.240
 -They both survived, they both shot and... -They both missed.

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:12.640
 Marcel shot first, he went in the sort of region of his feet,

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:14.960
 but didn't get him, and the other guy missed outright.

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:18.120
 -But you kind of, I guess, have to think about the times. -Of course, yeah.

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:21.960
 He was outing him for something that might have got him killed anyway

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:25.240
 for being a homosexual, maybe his dad having written what he wrote was a...

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:27.000
 -Yeah, it's... -It was a tough show.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.560
 He had a tough life, didn't he, Marcel, or Marcel?

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:30.560
 -Yeah. -Yeah.

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:33.120
 He once diagnosed himself with a brain disorder

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:37.120
 and said that the only way to cure it was by drilling loads of holes into his skull.

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:38.720
 -Oh, dear. -Did he do that?

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:43.000
 He begged a doctor to do it, and the doctor, quite responsible for doctors at the time,

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.200
 said, "I'm not going to do that."

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:49.600
 -Yeah. -Well, in fairness, that's around 1910, that was standard.

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:52.640
 -Mm-hmm. -Yeah, they were trapanning around that time.

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:55.680
 -Yeah. -Oh, yeah, yeah, someone won a Nobel Prize for it.

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:59.720
 -That's right, they did, yeah. -The main, main character

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:03.040
 in Alarashesh Tapatopadu was going to be the Madeleine.

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:06.640
 So the whole point of it is... Not the whole point, but I read the very start,

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:10.800
 he's kind of got this Madeleine cake, and he has a bite of it,

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:14.680
 and suddenly he remembers all the history and things that happened

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:17.360
 because this evoked such a memory from him.

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:19.760
 -So I thought I'd look into Madeleines. -Oh, yeah.

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:22.520
 Apparently invented by a young girl called Madeleine,

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:25.360
 who stood in for the chef to the Duke of Lorraine.

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:28.760
 We're not quite sure why, but the chef wasn't there,

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:30.760
 and they were like, "You, in."

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:34.720
 And she only knew one recipe, and that was her grandmother's recipe for cakes,

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:38.920
 and so that's all she made, and so she just made loads and loads of these,

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:41.040
 and they were named after her, apparently.

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:43.920
 And in 2006, there was a thing called Café Europa,

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:47.920
 it was an EU thing, where every country in Europe

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:51.920
 had to give their best cake or their best sweet thing,

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:55.320
 and then they would celebrate them all, and France gave them Madeleine.

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:58.400
 -Really? Because they're quite crap. -Oh, really?

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.280
 Yeah, they're just... Do you guys know what they are?

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:02.400
 -They're like a little sponge cake. -I've not had one.

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:05.200
 You would have had one. They're just so boring.

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.400
 You idiot, Dan. Of course you've had one.

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:09.560
 Ironically, they're very easy to forget.

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:11.480
 Yes.

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:13.480
 They're like a tiny little sponge cake.

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:17.320
 They're shaped like a scallop, a shell, you know, a seashell.

00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:19.400
 -They're shaped like that. -Yeah, yeah, okay.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:22.400
 But in the original book, it was a bit of toast, originally.

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:25.160
 I thought, "This needs a rewrite."

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:27.480
 I just wondered if you wanted to guess some other countries

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:29.400
 -and what they did for their sweet things. -Oh, my God, yeah.

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:31.720
 Because France has so much France, it's the land of cakes, you know?

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:34.120
 The Eclair. I would have submitted the Eclair.

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:36.080
 Well, you didn't. Have they didn't?

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:38.080
 Yeah. Did they win? Did they win with the Madeleine?

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:40.120
 It wasn't a competition. It was just like...

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:41.680
 What's the point of it, then? What is it?

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:43.800
 What's the point of anything if it isn't a competition?

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:45.800
 You know, this isn't a competition, Andy.

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:47.800
 No one wins this out of the four of us at the end.

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:50.920
 Don't be ridiculous. We've been scoring for the last 450 episodes.

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:53.840
 -I'm definitely confident. -I actually can imagine Andy going home

00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:56.920
 and having a little white barge when he puts that in.

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.920
 Another great win, Andy. Well done.

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:02.200
 The soul metric is a number of chicken-rubbing references

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:04.200
 made throughout the show.

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.200
 OK, so what other countries have made it?

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:09.800
 I mean, yeah, just that. They're all relatively easy to guess. Belgium.

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:12.200
 -It has to be a sweet thing. -Croissant?

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:15.800
 -Croissants in Belgium. -Sweet chips.

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:17.720
 Sweet chips.

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:20.800
 Like, honey... Honeyfried.

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:23.400
 -Waffles. -Waffles, waffles, waffles.

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:25.400
 Portugal, pastel de nata, for instance.

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:27.400
 Don't give it all away. Don't give it all away.

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:29.400
 I just thought we'd go straight, maybe, to the UK.

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:31.400
 Can you guess what the UK gets? Bloody hell.

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:34.400
 Oh, that sort of pink Tottenham cake that you get in Gregg's.

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:36.400
 It's very nice.

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:38.400
 It's so nice.

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:40.400
 I don't know what that is.

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:42.400
 I'm pretty sure it wasn't from Gregg's.

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:44.400
 OK, OK. Victoria's sponge cake.

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:46.400
 No, no.

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:48.400
 Thick Norf.

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:50.400
 -Thick Norf? -Thick Norf?

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:52.400
 -Oh, those buns. -Fervent Norf.

00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:54.400
 -Scottish... -Scottish roll.

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:56.400
 [LAUGHTER]

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:58.400
 A Scotch egg.

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.400
 They misunderstood the category and they gave a Scotch egg.

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:02.400
 A deep-fried Mars bar.

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:04.400
 [LAUGHTER]

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:06.400
 -A haggis. -A haggis.

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:08.400
 -A sweet haggis. -A sweet...

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:10.400
 What, and sausage roll was fine?

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:12.400
 -You said sausage roll. -That was me?

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:14.400
 Oh, my God.

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.400
 It was shortbread.

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:19.400
 Oh, OK.

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:21.400
 And Denmark went for the Danish pastry,

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:23.400
 even though they were invented in Austria.

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:25.400
 -Ooh. -Sneaky.

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:27.400
 And who won?

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:29.400
 [LAUGHTER]

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:31.400
 I think the Madeleine bit

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:33.400
 is really only famous because

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:35.400
 it's so near the beginning.

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:37.400
 It's the only bit anyone's got to.

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.400
 I have to say I have read

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:41.400
 and intend to when I have

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.400
 a period of time off next year.

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:45.400
 Read properly, but I researched it on Purdue

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:47.400
 because I think people are really hard on it,

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:49.400
 even at the time they said it was impenetrable.

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:52.400
 And I think it's really fun to read from the 40 pages I read.

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:54.400
 But the Madeleine does come up within those 40 pages,

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.400
 and it's not that relevant after that.

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:58.400
 But he did, it shows how much he agonised

00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:00.400
 over everything, that as you said, Andy,

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:02.400
 it was a piece of toast for a bit.

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.400
 It was also a piece of stale bread,

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:06.400
 which is quite, I don't know why you would eat that.

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:08.400
 It was...

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:10.400
 It was a sausage roll at one stage, wasn't it?

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.400
 [LAUGHTER]

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:16.400
 OK, it is time

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:18.400
 for fact number three,

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:20.400
 and that is Andy.

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.400
 My fact is that in the 1920s,

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.400
 a smart young man would have two handkerchiefs,

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:26.400
 a blower and a shower.

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:28.400
 [LAUGHTER]

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:32.400
 Yeah.

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:34.400
 It's disgusting.

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:36.400
 It's disgusting.

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:38.400
 What's the difference between them?

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:40.400
 Yes, there is a difference.

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:42.400
 So, I got this from, I was reading an old novel

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:44.400
 called Green Banks by Dorothy Whipple,

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:46.400
 which is great, she's great,

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:48.400
 and there's a scene in it where there's a young man

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.400
 waiting for his girlfriend,

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.400
 and he talks about having his blower in his shower,

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:54.400
 and I just peaked my interest.

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:56.400
 [LAUGHTER]

00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:58.400
 It's very funny.

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:00.400
 It's hard to google.

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:02.400
 So, the shower is the one you have

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.400
 in your top pocket, the sort of pocket square

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:06.400
 that looks incredibly neat and jazzy,

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:08.400
 and then the blower is the one

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:10.400
 you keep up your sleeve with all the snot on it,

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:12.400
 and that's the difference between them.

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:14.400
 Could the shower become a blower?

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.400
 Oh, yes.

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:18.400
 Absolutely.

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:20.400
 But you couldn't make a blower a shower, could you?

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:22.400
 No. No.

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:24.400
 You can blow a shower, but you can't show a blower.

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:26.400
 [LAUGHTER]

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:28.400
 I disagree.

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:30.400
 It depends on where you're blowing on the blower.

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:32.400
 If you blow on the blower in, like, a top corner,

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:34.400
 and then you fold it down, half of it,

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:36.400
 it's like an iceberg, a shower.

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:38.400
 There's a lot of it below the surface area.

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:40.400
 Well, okay.

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:42.400
 Yeah, just don't blow on the show bit of your blower.

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:44.400
 But it could start to come through the pocket, you know, like...

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:46.400
 How?

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.400
 If you've got enough... How stocky are you?

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:50.400
 If you've got that cold, then you don't want

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:52.400
 to snot seeping out of the bottom of your pocket

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:54.400
 with the shower proudly seeping out the top.

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.400
 No, that's true. Yeah.

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:58.400
 I say keep them separate. I say keep them separate.

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:00.400
 Dan's the one who's proposed this Maverick system where you can...

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:02.400
 [LAUGHTER]

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.400
 But it's rare, this usage of these phrases,

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:06.400
 but it did exist at the time.

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:08.400
 It crops up in the New York Times in 1927,

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:10.400
 and it's a report about the handkerchief

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:12.400
 being something from ancient China, you know, originally,

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:14.400
 the only show was not blowers.

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.400
 And it didn't used to be for that, did it?

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:18.400
 We only actually started blowing anything into handkerchiefs

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:20.400
 in about 400 years ago.

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:22.400
 And it seems like a long time ago.

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:24.400
 But we had handkerchiefs long before that,

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:26.400
 or kerchiefs, which are just...

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:28.400
 It's just a word for something that wraps

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:30.400
 around your head, in fact.

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:32.400
 A headkerchief?

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:34.400
 Well, this is what's so weird.

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:36.400
 A kerchief is literally a head covering,

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.400
 chief head, and then ker was covering.

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.400
 And so now we have a hand-head covering,

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:42.400
 is the word?

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:44.400
 Is a head covering you hold in your hand, basically.

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:46.400
 Yeah.

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:48.400
 I always thought that kerchief,

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:50.400
 when people say it, as they often do,

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:52.400
 was an abbreviation of handkerchief.

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:54.400
 Didn't know it had gone the other way.

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:56.400
 We know the first person, possibly,

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:58.400
 who blew their nose on a handkerchief.

00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:00.400
 Kidding, really? What?

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:02.400
 Well, we know the first person who wrote about it.

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.400
 And this was a guy called Desiderius Erasmus,

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:06.400
 who we have mentioned once or twice before.

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:08.400
 The philosopher?

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.400
 The philosopher and religious scholar.

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.400
 But he also, and we have said this before,

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:14.400
 he wrote a best-selling book

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:16.400
 on etiquette.

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.400
 And at one stage, it was a best-selling book

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.400
 in the whole of Europe for dozens and dozens,

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:22.400
 if not 100 years after the Bible.

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:24.400
 Basically, the Bible and then this.

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:26.400
 And in this book, it said stuff like,

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:28.400
 "Do not be afraid of vomiting.

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:30.400
 It is not vomiting, but holding vomits

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:32.400
 in your throat that's foul."

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:34.400
 Mmm.

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:36.400
 Politely disagree.

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:38.400
 OK. Well, let's see.

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:40.400
 Having been up and down some high streets

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.400
 on an early Sunday morning,

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:44.400
 sometimes you do wish people had held it

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:46.400
 in their throat a bit.

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:48.400
 He also said, "If you cannot swallow

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:50.400
 a piece of food, turn around discreetly

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:52.400
 and throw it somewhere."

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:54.400
 Oh, that is good advice.

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:56.400
 That's good. And finally,

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.400
 "Do not move back and forth on your chair.

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:00.400
 Whoever does that gives the impression

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:02.400
 of constantly breaking or trying

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:04.400
 to break wind."

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:06.400
 Just America.

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:08.400
 Oh, I think it was him, sorry,

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:10.400
 who said, "Because this was just about the time

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:12.400
 when handkerchiefs were starting to be blown

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:14.400
 noses on."

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:16.400
 Have noses blown on them.

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:18.400
 And so, some didn't, some didn't.

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:20.400
 And he said, "If you need to blow your nose,

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:22.400
 you can do it on the floor, not a table."

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.400
 On the floor? On the floor? Yeah.

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:26.400
 Blow your nose on the floor? Oh, right.

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:28.400
 Put your finger to your nostril and blow it

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:30.400
 in the direction. Yeah, sorry.

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:32.400
 You don't have to rub your face against the floor.

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:34.400
 Yeah, exactly.

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:36.400
 But he said, "If it is visible,

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.400
 you do have to keep stepping over it

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:40.400
 and on it until it's gone away."

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:42.400
 Yeah. And he was basically, because people

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:44.400
 were doing that or wiping out on their clothes

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.400
 and he said, "This was an improvement," which I think

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:48.400
 even Andy will admit. Yeah.

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:50.400
 The handkerchief? Yeah. Definitely an improvement.

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:52.400
 No, no, they're blowing on the floor compared to blowing on your clothes

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:54.400
 because I would say blowing, I'd probably do a subtle blow

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:56.400
 into my cuff rather than onto the floor, wouldn't you?

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:58.400
 Depends on the scale of the blow.

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:00.400
 Yeah, it depends. I just think it's completely...

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:02.400
 Sounds like with your leaking handkerchiefs

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.400
 as a dangerous manoeuvre.

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.400
 There was a thing that I read, which is that

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:08.400
 there was a period where people weren't carrying

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:10.400
 two handkerchiefs on them, but 30.

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:12.400
 This was actually as part of

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:14.400
 defence against

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:16.400
 bullets. So what this was is,

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.400
 in the late 1800s,

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:20.400
 there was a physician called George E. Goodfellow.

00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:22.400
 He lived in Tomb Zone, Arizona,

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:24.400
 or certainly was there at the time,

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.400
 and there was a post-mortem that was done on a man

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:28.400
 who'd been shot, and there was a silk handkerchief

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:30.400
 in his breast pocket, and they realised

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:32.400
 that the silk handkerchief had

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:34.400
 significantly helped for the bullet

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:36.400
 to penetrate less. It was like, wow, that dented

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:38.400
 the force of which it went. So he thought,

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:40.400
 "What if we dressed

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:42.400
 in lots of handkerchiefs, then

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:44.400
 we would never die?" So he invented

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:46.400
 what was... This is such a chaotic...

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:48.400
 premature bulletproof vest,

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:50.400
 whereby you wore 30 layers

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:52.400
 of handkerchiefs on your body.

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:54.400
 Yeah, and I think

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.400
 it worked. I think people were shocked.

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:58.400
 He did, until he got a really heavy cold,

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:00.400
 and he just had to keep pulling around.

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:02.400
 He became less and less safe.

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:04.400
 Did people actually wear it?

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:06.400
 Or was it just him trying to market his product?

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:08.400
 It was him just experimenting with the idea

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:10.400
 of bulletproof vests didn't need

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:12.400
 to be metal plating, which is what everyone

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:14.400
 was using at this point. The problem is

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:16.400
 30 handkerchief vests weighed

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:18.400
 much more than a metal plating, so...

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:20.400
 But it is... It is white.

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:22.400
 No Morris Dancer has ever been shot.

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:24.400
 Because they've got the skills to move the handkerchief

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:26.400
 into position at the right time.

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:28.400
 So, handkerchief.

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:30.400
 Yeah. The word "hanky-panky".

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:32.400
 Oh, OK.

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:34.400
 Does it come... Is it related to handkerchiefs?

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:36.400
 It has nothing to do

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:38.400
 with handkerchiefs.

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:40.400
 It's not short for handkerchief-pankerchief.

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:42.400
 LAUGHTER

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:46.400
 No, it's not.

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:50.400
 Can it be now?

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:52.400
 Yeah. I just

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:54.400
 imagined Andy going back home to his wife.

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:56.400
 Little bit of handkerchief-pankerchief.

00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:58.400
 LAUGHTER

00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:04.400
 I'm only wearing 27 layers

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:06.400
 of handkerchiefs tonight, darling.

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:08.400
 Oh...

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:10.400
 Is there a factor in that?

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:12.400
 Not really, guys.

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:14.400
 It's that handkerchief-panky

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:16.400
 has nothing to do with sex.

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:18.400
 It's completely originally meant juggling

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:20.400
 or trickery.

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:22.400
 But still nothing to do with handkerchiefs

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:24.400
 because you would think...

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:26.400
 It's maybe related to hocus-pocus.

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:28.400
 Right. Hocus-pocus, hanky-panky.

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:30.400
 That's a very sleazy magician, sorry.

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:32.400
 Hocus-pocus, hanky-panky.

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:34.400
 LAUGHTER

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:36.400
 Have you guys heard of the

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:38.400
 Valsalva effect?

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.400
 No. The Valsalva effect

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:42.400
 is something that we've probably all done.

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:44.400
 We must have all done this, which is

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:46.400
 when your ears are blocked

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:48.400
 or you're on a plane and you get descending,

00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:50.400
 there's action of holding your nose

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:52.400
 and holding your mouth

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.400
 and blowing to get your ears popping.

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:56.400
 That's what you do to equalize as well, isn't it?

00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:58.400
 Yeah. So it's the opposite of blowing your nose.

00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:00.400
 You're sucking in...

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:02.400
 You're using the pressure that's shooting inwards.

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:04.400
 So that's used for a number of things.

00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:06.400
 It's for relieving your ears.

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:08.400
 It's for people with abnormal heart rhythms.

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:10.400
 They use it to relieve chest pain.

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:12.400
 They say if you do have

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:14.400
 abnormal heart problems that you should always

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:16.400
 consult a doctor before doing that,

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:18.400
 just to make sure that you don't

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:20.400
 make the situation worse.

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:22.400
 But another thing that it's used for

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:24.400
 is for people who suffer from premature ejaculation.

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:26.400
 Oh, really?

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:28.400
 Because I have very bad sinuses

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:30.400
 and have...

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.400
 ..and literally do that

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:34.400
 Valsalva effect, I would say about

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.400
 20 times a day.

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:38.400
 Right.

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:40.400
 I don't want to know what person or link you're making

00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:42.400
 to what bit of get-first is coming.

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:44.400
 I want to know what's coming.

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:46.400
 Not you.

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:52.400
 You manage it.

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:54.400
 Yeah, so pretty exciting, isn't it?

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:56.400
 So you're supposed to do that mid-to-sex?

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:58.400
 I think... I couldn't see where they said

00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:00.400
 if it was before or during,

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:02.400
 but I imagine it's during, and I'm not sure

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:04.400
 how you can disguise that as a sexy thing.

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:06.400
 So next time you're having handkerchief,

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:08.400
 handkerchief at home maybe.

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:10.400
 Try it out and let us know

00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:12.400
 if it's before or during that it's required.

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:14.400
 They are sexy things, though, aren't they?

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:16.400
 Handkerchiefs. They were used

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.400
 for sexy purposes back in the day.

00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:20.400
 In the 19th century, there were another one of these things

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:22.400
 where there was a whole language behind handkerchiefs

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:24.400
 that lovers could use to convey

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:26.400
 messages to each other.

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:28.400
 And there's actually a book, because we've talked before,

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:30.400
 I think about the language of flowers.

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:32.400
 If you sent flowers in a certain arrangement,

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:34.400
 it meant different things.

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:36.400
 Fans, the language of fans.

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:38.400
 If your fan is three-quarters open, it means I'd like a handjob

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:40.400
 but not a blowjob or whatever.

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:42.400
 As you see, the woman with the fan.

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:44.400
 So actually, anyway...

00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:46.400
 You're an absolute menace

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:48.400
 in the summer, aren't you, Anna?

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:50.400
 LAUGHTER

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:56.400
 Question one, if you just want to keep cool.

00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:58.400
 Being pounced on.

00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:00.400
 There's a book published in 1879

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:02.400
 called "A Complete Guide

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:04.400
 to Glertation, Containing Handkerchief,

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:06.400
 a Glove, Fan and Paracel Flirtations

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:08.400
 and a Complete Language

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:10.400
 of Flowers". So we have to assume everyone

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:12.400
 memorized this at the time, so they understood

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:14.400
 what each other was saying.

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:16.400
 But drawing a handkerchief across your forehead,

00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:18.400
 do you know what that means?

00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:20.400
 Sweaty. Yeah.

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:22.400
 It either means you're sweating profusely

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:24.400
 or it means we are being watched.

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:26.400
 Oh.

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:28.400
 Don't jump me.

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:32.400
 Across the cheeks was "I Love You".

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:34.400
 Face cheeks?

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:36.400
 LAUGHTER

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:38.400
 LAUGHTER

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:40.400
 The face cheeks, yes.

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:42.400
 It's worth knowing.

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:44.400
 Yeah. It doesn't actually...

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:46.400
 This is where the problems can come, if you don't know.

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:48.400
 I didn't actually note down the arse cheeks one,

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:50.400
 so you'll have to just decide for yourselves.

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:52.400
 Through the hands, if someone, you're talking to someone,

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:54.400
 they'll weave a handkerchief through their hands.

00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:56.400
 Oh, yeah. I hate you.

00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:58.400
 Oh! Really?

00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:00.400
 It's horrible.

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:02.400
 There was another one later in the 1970s,

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:04.400
 which was in the LGBTQ community.

00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:06.400
 And you might wear

00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:08.400
 different handkerchiefs or bandanas,

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:10.400
 and the colour might tell you what your fetish was.

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:12.400
 So if you're in a club with like-minded people,

00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:14.400
 it would tell them what you're thinking.

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:16.400
 Also, cartoon characters tend to wear

00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:18.400
 hankies and bandanas around their necks

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:20.400
 because necks are quite hard to draw.

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:22.400
 Oh, really?

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:24.400
 And so... Oh, no.

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:26.400
 Fred Flintstone wears a light blue sort of

00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:28.400
 cloth around his neck.

00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:30.400
 Apparently, he's into fallatio.

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:32.400
 LAUGHTER

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.400
 I'll rattle through these.

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:36.400
 Fred from Scooby-Doo,

00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:38.400
 red, fisting, and...

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:40.400
 Oh!

00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:42.400
 Captain Pugwash,

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:44.400
 light cream, rimming.

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:46.400
 So...

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:48.400
 It's just if they happen to be in a club,

00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:50.400
 then that's what we've got.

00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:52.400
 Wow.

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:56.400
 OK, it's time for our final fact of the show,

00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:58.400
 and that is James.

00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:01.400
 OK, my fact this week is that in the 1960s,

00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:03.400
 owners of a theme park in Pennsylvania

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:05.400
 had guards with plastic bats

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:07.400
 in the Tunnel of Love ride

00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:09.400
 who were instructed to give an admonishing

00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:11.400
 thwack to any bear bums

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:13.400
 that they saw.

00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:15.400
 LAUGHTER

00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:17.400
 Cover that with a handkerchief now!

00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:19.400
 LAUGHTER

00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:21.400
 So this is a true thing that happened.

00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:23.400
 In actual fact, it didn't just happen in Pennsylvania.

00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:25.400
 It happened in a few different places.

00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:27.400
 And when you're saying plastic bats,

00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:29.400
 I'm thinking of table tennis bats.

00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:31.400
 I'm not thinking of a plastic

00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:33.400
 winged mammal bat.

00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:35.400
 LAUGHTER

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:37.400
 I have seen them. They are table tennis bats.

00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:39.400
 Nice. Some of them were actually almost in the shape

00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:41.400
 of a hand, you know, like one of those big, sort of foam hands.

00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:43.400
 Yeah.

00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:45.400
 It was plastic, and they would whack the bums like that.

00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:47.400
 Oh, wow. And it's cos they didn't want people

00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:49.400
 making out all worse in their Tunnels of Love.

00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:51.400
 No, handkerchief, handkerchief. No.

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:53.400
 LAUGHTER

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:55.400
 So this was an article.

00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:57.400
 Originally, I read this in Mental Floss,

00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:59.400
 and I followed it up and found an article

00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:01.400
 in the Pittsburgh City Paper.

00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:03.400
 And this is about a place called Kenneword Theme Park.

00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:05.400
 And there is a ride there called The Old Mill.

00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:07.400
 It was constructed in 1901.

00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:09.400
 It's the oldest roller coaster in the whole place.

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:11.400
 And it's one of these, you know, like a log flume,

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:13.400
 where you're going in the water,

00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:15.400
 but there's no up and down bits.

00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:17.400
 You're just kind of slowly going round in the water.

00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:19.400
 Yeah.

00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:21.400
 And there's like things to see on the side.

00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:23.400
 So there might be scary things.

00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:25.400
 There might be skeletons, or there might be sexy things,

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:27.400
 or whatever.

00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:29.400
 Yeah. Yeah? Yeah.

00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:31.400
 Yeah, fair enough.

00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:33.400
 And then I found this YouTuber

00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:35.400
 called Defunctland,

00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:37.400
 and he's done a video on this,

00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:39.400
 and it's one of the best videos I've ever seen

00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:41.400
 in my entire life on YouTube.

00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:43.400
 It's all about this place.

00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:45.400
 And he found an article from 1934

00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:47.400
 saying that this Tunnel of Love

00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:49.400
 was a really good place for people to make out.

00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:51.400
 And he found other Tunnels of Love

00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:53.400
 where people were whacking birdbombs.

00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:55.400
 And he asked people,

00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:57.400
 "Have you or anyone you know

00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:59.400
 ever kissed

00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:01.400
 or had sex

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:03.400
 on the Tunnel of Love

00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:05.400
 in Kennywood?"

00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:07.400
 And he tweeted saying that

00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:09.400
 "I have received the most explicit,

00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:11.400
 disgusting and shocking emails

00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:13.400
 I have ever read."

00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:15.400
 [laughter]

00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:17.400
 So this was really...

00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:19.400
 And there are newspaper articles from the 30s, 40s, 50s,

00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:21.400
 60s, even, all of them saying

00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:23.400
 this is the place to go and make out.

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:25.400
 This is where kids make out.

00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:27.400
 This is so famous for that.

00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:29.400
 It's only six minutes long, the ride.

00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:31.400
 Four minutes more than I need, buddy.

00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:33.400
 [laughter]

00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:35.400
 Well, I've got a technique with a nose.

00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:37.400
 [laughter]

00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:39.400
 I wonder for how many people

00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:41.400
 who got slapped on the butt by the ping-pong paddle,

00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:43.400
 that turned into

00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:45.400
 a sort of exciting new fetish that they didn't realise.

00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:47.400
 I think there might have been a bit of that.

00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:49.400
 There must have been so many Christmases where

00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:51.400
 they were going, "Yeah, yeah, I've got some ping-pong paddles.

00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:53.400
 I don't know, I just want to get into the sport."

00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:55.400
 There's no reason.

00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:57.400
 Can I say something incredibly boring

00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:59.400
 about this theme park, Kennywood?

00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:01.400
 Yeah.

00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:03.400
 So it was a trolley park originally,

00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:05.400
 and a few weeks ago on the podcast we mentioned trams.

00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:07.400
 Yeah.

00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:09.400
 That episode hasn't gone out yet,

00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:11.400
 but we will have recently mentioned trams.

00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:13.400
 [laughter]

00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:15.400
 And what's a trolley park?

00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:17.400
 I'm so glad you asked, Dan.

00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:19.400
 It is a miniature adventure park,

00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:21.400
 or a park with rides,

00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:23.400
 that's put at the end of a trolley line.

00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:25.400
 So trolley is just an American word for a tram, basically.

00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:27.400
 And it was to encourage people

00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:29.400
 to use the trolley car network at weekends.

00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:31.400
 So you would normally use them to get to work,

00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:33.400
 but at the weekend they weren't being used,

00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:35.400
 so they put something to attract people.

00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:37.400
 Exactly.

00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:39.400
 And so, sorry, I just thought we were all having so much fun,

00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:41.400
 and I just wanted to talk about tram infrastructure.

00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:43.400
 [laughter]

00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:45.400
 No, it's a good pallet cleanser.

00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:47.400
 Any more on this?

00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:49.400
 Well, just one other ride that there was

00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:51.400
 at Kennywood in the early days,

00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:53.400
 which was, sorry, not a ride.

00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:55.400
 There was one thing, an attraction called the House of Mystery,

00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:57.400
 but no one knows what it was.

00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:59.400
 [laughter]

00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:01.400
 That's pretty good.

00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:03.400
 Did no one ever come out of it?

00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:05.400
 It's been lost to history, unfortunately.

00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:07.400
 And there was one thing called spring water,

00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:09.400
 which was just a water fountain,

00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:11.400
 the stream of water coming from a spring.

00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:13.400
 There was a tin cup you could use to get a drink,

00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:15.400
 but you could use the water,

00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:17.400
 so that you would just get an electric shock

00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:19.400
 every time you tried to have a drink.

00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:21.400
 That was entertainment.

00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:23.400
 These rides are tunnels of love,

00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:25.400
 which you don't really see much anymore.

00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:27.400
 In fact, I don't think I've ever seen one myself,

00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:29.400
 a fairground ride or a theme park or whatever.

00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:31.400
 There's a few, like, in the UK.

00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:33.400
 Yeah, yeah.

00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:35.400
 But they're basically the equivalent of rides

00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:37.400
 that we've all seen at parks where you essentially get on them

00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:39.400
 when you can't be asked a cue for one of the good rides again,

00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:41.400
 and so you just sit on this really slow, boring boat.

00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:44.400
 And so they were often haunted rides

00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:47.400
 that were converted to tunnels of love or vice versa, weren't they?

00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:49.400
 So I think this one, at Kennywood,

00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:51.400
 went on to become hard-headed Harold,

00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:53.400
 horrendously humorous, haunted hideaway.

00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:55.400
 That's right.

00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:57.400
 It sounds like a worse ride.

00:49:57.400 --> 00:50:00.400
 They also branded it as a Panama Canal.

00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:02.400
 So you would go down here,

00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:04.400
 and it was this few going along the Panama Canal.

00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:05.400
 That's great.

00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:07.400
 It is, but the Panama Canal is literally just a canal.

00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:09.400
 There's no fun stuff on either side.

00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:10.400
 No, you're right.

00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:12.400
 And then in the end,

00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:15.400
 it was rebranded as Garfield's Nightmare Ride.

00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:17.400
 All of these...

00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:19.400
 Cat. Yeah.

00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:21.400
 Or President James Garfield.

00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:23.400
 Who wastes everything through his anus

00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:25.400
 for the last three months of his life.

00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:27.400
 Weird ride.

00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:29.400
 But I want to ride.

00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:31.400
 This guy, Defunkland,

00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:33.400
 who did this amazing video,

00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:37.400
 he said that he thinks, after getting all these emails,

00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:39.400
 that there are at least two people

00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:41.400
 who were conceived on that ride.

00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:43.400
 Oh, great, really?

00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:46.400
 And Kennywood Theme Park now uses the slogan,

00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:48.400
 "Welcome to the family."

00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:50.400
 But that's just a coincidence.

00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:51.400
 That's okay.

00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:53.400
 The Tunnel of Love, really.

00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:56.400
 I've read something saying there used to be hundreds,

00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:58.400
 as in maybe 700 across the USA.

00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:01.400
 Yeah, the USA is big, but that has a lot of Tunnels of Love.

00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:03.400
 But it all sort of sadly came into an end

00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:05.400
 because of the sexual revolution.

00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:07.400
 Yeah, but that's the thing.

00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:09.400
 The humanity became liberalised.

00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:11.400
 So basically you could snog in public.

00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:13.400
 You didn't have to go into a tunnel.

00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:15.400
 And because they were such a shit ride,

00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:17.400
 that was really the only good thing about them.

00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:20.400
 Another strike against the sexual revolution.

00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:23.400
 Do you guys know what was the fastest way to travel

00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:25.400
 in the entire world in 1880?

00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:28.400
 I'm going to say Tunnel of Love.

00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:31.400
 That is a ridiculous thing to say.

00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:34.400
 I don't know if everything was slow at the time.

00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:36.400
 Maybe there was a point in 1880 where all trains broke.

00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:38.400
 All the horses in the lane.

00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:40.400
 All the horses died.

00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:42.400
 Was it?

00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:44.400
 I'm just kind of...

00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:46.400
 Because I know this sneaky man, what he does.

00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:48.400
 I start seeking.

00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:50.400
 Was it an underground train system

00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:52.400
 that was one of the first of its kind,

00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:54.400
 underground in Paris that led to the Louvre?

00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:57.400
 And so it was the Tunnel of Love.

00:51:57.400 --> 00:51:59.400
 The Louvre?

00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:02.400
 He's seeking. He's not the Riddler.

00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:07.400
 OK, I'm going to have a pun.

00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:09.400
 Fastest trains at the time.

00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:12.400
 In America, they were only about 30 or 40 miles an hour.

00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:15.400
 In the UK, I think we had up to about 60 or 70 miles an hour.

00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:18.400
 I'm talking about something that was going at 112 miles an hour.

00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:20.400
 And this was public transport.

00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:22.400
 It was something you could travel on.

00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:25.400
 Because if you jump off the Eiffel Tower or something...

00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:28.400
 I wouldn't say jumping off the Eiffel Tower is transport.

00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:31.400
 And in 1880, definitely not.

00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:34.400
 Another bad commute, darling.

00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:36.400
 OK, no, no, but I think...

00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:38.400
 So the Tunnel of Love is a kind of boat ride that you go on.

00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:41.400
 Is it something like a log flume?

00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:43.400
 It's exactly a log flume.

00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:47.400
 So I found an article in the Chicago Herald in 1886

00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:49.400
 that told of a group of loggers, right?

00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:51.400
 So they're at the top of a mountain,

00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:54.400
 and they created these flumes.

00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:56.400
 They were kind of metal flumes,

00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:58.400
 which they would send the logs down,

00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:00.400
 and they would all go down to the bottom,

00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:02.400
 and that's where they would process them.

00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:04.400
 You cut them at the top, you would send them down.

00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:06.400
 Really, really steep.

00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:08.400
 Now, at the end of the day,

00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:11.400
 all of these workers would get on one of these logs

00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:13.400
 and fly down.

00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:15.400
 OK, there was a quote, and they said,

00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:17.400
 "We all looked at our watches.

00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:20.400
 We had made 16 miles in eight minutes and 40 seconds."

00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:23.400
 So that is an average speed of 112 miles an hour.

00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:25.400
 But they did come down there.

00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:27.400
 It's so terrifying.

00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:30.400
 There was a journalist in 1875, I think,

00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:33.400
 who went to report on the Nevada log flumes,

00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:35.400
 and they looked so cool,

00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:37.400
 and there is video footage of the logs going down them,

00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:41.400
 and they were built really high on scaffolding into the air,

00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:43.400
 like 70 feet in the air,

00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:46.400
 and they were these channels, which they zoomed down.

00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:48.400
 And yeah, this journalist said,

00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:50.400
 "Does anyone ever go down it?"

00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:52.400
 And they said, "Yeah, yeah, you can totally do that."

00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:54.400
 Now, I still don't know if the log was on this one,

00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:56.400
 actually did go down it, or they were pranking the journalist,

00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:58.400
 because the journalist said, "OK, I will."

00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:00.400
 The two owners of the log flume said,

00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:03.400
 "All right, well, if you're doing it, I guess we'll do it."

00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:06.400
 And none of the loggers agreed to get in with them.

00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:09.400
 And as they pushed him off, one of the loggers shouted,

00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:11.400
 "A flume has no element of safety.

00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:14.400
 You cannot stop. You cannot lessen your speed.

00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:16.400
 You have only to sit still, shut your eyes,

00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:19.400
 say your prayers, and wait for eternity. Bye!"

00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:21.400
 Smile for the camera.

00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:26.400
 And that's what their log flume rides are based on, those, right?

00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:28.400
 Right, yeah, yeah.

00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:30.400
 I think they've all shut down other log flumes,

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:33.400
 but I think there was one operating relatively recently

00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:35.400
 in Washington, in the state of Washington,

00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:38.400
 which took an hour to go along, so it might have been a bit slower.

00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:40.400
 Yeah, yeah, they weren't all really steep,

00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:42.400
 just the ones on mountains were.

00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:44.400
 Lassie went on that one.

00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:47.400
 She did an episode of Lassie where Lassie went on a log flume.

00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:49.400
 OK, great.

00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:51.400
 Nice. Good.

00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:54.400
 She deserves a break.

00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:56.400
 Is Lassie a she? Yeah.

00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:58.400
 I didn't know that. Lassie.

00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:00.400
 Oh, Lassie.

00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:04.400
 It's in the name. It is in the name.

00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:06.400
 Jane Austen could have gone on a log flume.

00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:08.400
 That's the exciting...

00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:10.400
 It's one of my main interests is whether Jane Austen

00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:12.400
 could have done any of the tech we talk about.

00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:14.400
 So she was alive when...

00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:17.400
 But not the ride, the log flume, the actual log flume thing.

00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:19.400
 A tunneled boat ride.

00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:22.400
 This was a ride, actually. It was in France in 1817,

00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:24.400
 which is the year Austen died,

00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:26.400
 so she wouldn't have had a great time on it.

00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:28.400
 What a way to go.

00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:30.400
 What a way to go.

00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:32.400
 She died of something completely sort of ordinary and sad,

00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:34.400
 but if she died on a log flume,

00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:36.400
 it would have been perfect.

00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:39.400
 It was called the Soet du Niagara Falls,

00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:42.400
 and it was a boat which fell down a slope into a basin of water.

00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:44.400
 I mean, it's pretty much a classic log flume.

00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:46.400
 Anyway, Jane Austen could have...

00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:48.400
 I have a Red Mansfield Park. Is that about a theme park?

00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:50.400
 LAUGHTER

00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:52.400
 I can't believe you thought of Mansfield Park.

00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:54.400
 I was going through sense and sensibility.

00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:56.400
 No, that doesn't work.

00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:58.400
 Have you guys heard of...

00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:01.400
 There's a sex theme park in South Korea called Bloodland.

00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:03.400
 Have you seen it? No.

00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:05.400
 It's amazing. We say it's a theme park.

00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:07.400
 It's kind of like a sculpture park,

00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:10.400
 and it's just lots of penises and lots of people in positions of sex.

00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:12.400
 So it's not... You can't ride them, as it were.

00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:14.400
 There.

00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:16.400
 No, I don't think so.

00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:19.400
 Yeah, you can... Well, they do say there's a few hands-on exhibits,

00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:22.400
 such as the masturbation cycle,

00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:24.400
 which is you basically spin a thing

00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:28.400
 and you move their hands for them as part of this little exhibit.

00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:31.400
 It's a statue kind of thing. Right.

00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:33.400
 And then there's this really weird thing,

00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:35.400
 and I couldn't find anything more about it.

00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:37.400
 I searched quite a bit. It's this giant...

00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:40.400
 It's like a five-foot tall see-through penis

00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:43.400
 with sort of like computer workings all inside of it,

00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:45.400
 and it's just got a little plaque next to it,

00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:48.400
 and it's got a lot of words in Korean, which obviously I can't read.

00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:51.400
 But then there's only one English word on it, as far as I could see,

00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:53.400
 and the word is "terminator."

00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:55.400
 And that's...

00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:58.400
 I don't know if they're saying that's his particular penis,

00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:04.400
 or if it's a penis of the future coming back to our time to...

00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:07.400
 Would he have donated his penis? I haven't seen "terminator."

00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:09.400
 Is that the sort of thing that the character would do?

00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:12.400
 Yeah, I'll be back until I'm back. How's this?

00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:16.400
 Yeah, that's on Jeju Island, isn't it?

00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:18.400
 Yeah.

00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:21.400
 Originally, Jeju Island was like a honeymoon destination,

00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:24.400
 but it was... After the Korean War, there was a lot of arranged marriages,

00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:28.400
 so a lot of the couples had never seen each other or really met each other before,

00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:31.400
 and so they would go to this honeymoon destination,

00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:33.400
 and they were really inexperienced.

00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:35.400
 They didn't really know what to do,

00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:38.400
 and so they had... All the hotels had professional icebreakers

00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:40.400
 who would kind of sit next to you.

00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:43.400
 If you're having dinner at a restaurant and you're being a bit awkward,

00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:46.400
 - you're going to get a sensation again. - God, that's a great idea.

00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:54.400
 Sorry, you would be the worst human on earth as an icebreaker.

00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:57.400
 Did you know there was a trolley system on there?

00:57:57.400 --> 00:58:01.400
 Where are you going? Come back.

00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:04.400
 I'm saying I need one, not that I could be one.

00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:08.400
 I don't want to talk about traps any more than you do.

00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:10.400
 It's all I can think of.

00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:14.400
 Wow. This really is a cry for help.

00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:18.400
 OK, that is it. That is all of our facts.

00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:20.400

 sort of correspondence episodes and quizzes.

 There's also access to our Discord, where you can discuss all interesting things,

00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:06.400

 And also, there's a lot of really fun merch up there.

00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:10.400
