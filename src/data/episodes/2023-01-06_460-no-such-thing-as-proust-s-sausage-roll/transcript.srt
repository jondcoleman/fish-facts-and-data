1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,520
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,480
 - Hi everyone, happy new year.

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,960
 We have a little favor to ask you

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,240
 before we start with the 2013 episodes

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,800
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish."

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,360
 - 2013 episodes?

7
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,200
 - Is that not, oh, what year is it?

8
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,560
 - James, oh my God, this is so sad.

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,800
 You've just woken up from a coma

10
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,120
 and you haven't realized that 10 years have passed.

11
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,920
 - No, no, you mean this is an episode two

12
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,520
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish"?

13
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,160
 - I'm so sorry, but you're gonna be delighted

14
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,760
 with how far we've come in the interim.

15
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,080
 - Wow, well, what have we done while I've been in a coma?

16
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,680
 Have we told the world?

17
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,520
 Have we made some books?

18
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,360
 Have we won any national comedy awards?

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,160
 - Well, do you know, it's funny, you should mention that.

20
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,640
 That's the one thing we haven't quite done yet.

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,120
 And we're delighted to have you back.

22
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,720
 We've had to simulate your presence for the last decade.

23
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,160
 Delighted to have you back to help us win them

24
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,880
 'cause that is what we're supposed to be talking about

25
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,760
 right now.

26
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,160
 It is the national comedy awards

27
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,640
 and we are on the long list.

28
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,920

29
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,560
 We would absolutely love to get to the shortlist.

 Like, we're quite near the end.

39
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,960
 So if you don't know who was the best supporting actor

40
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,680
 in a foreign sitcom this year, then it doesn't matter.

41
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,720
 You can just click past it, get to the podcast bit,

42
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,120

 bish bash bosh, job done.

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,920
 And we might get nominated for an award.

45
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,160
 I'm going back to sleep.

46
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,240
 Enjoy the show.

47
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,000
 On with the podcast.

48
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,240
 - On with the podcast.

49
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,840
 (upbeat music)

50
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:51,080
 (speaking in foreign language)

51
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,780
 (upbeat music)

52
00:01:53,780 --> 00:02:00,080
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

53
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,120
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish,"

54
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,480
 a weekly podcast this week, coming to you live

55
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,720
 from the Bloomsbury Theater in London.

56
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:12,000
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

57
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,400
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

58
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,000
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

59
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,400
 And once again, we have gathered round the microphones

60
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,520
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

61
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,280
 and in no particular order, here we go.

62
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,600
 Starting with fact number one, and that is my fact,

63
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,600
 my fact this week, is that originally Popeye,

64
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,640
 the sailor man, got his powers, not from eating spinach,

65
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,380
 but by rubbing a lucky magic hen.

66
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:43,880
 - I love the fact that you need to specify Popeye,

67
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,360
 the sailor man.

68
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,800
 Oh, Popeye, that's how Popeye, yeah, yeah, yeah.

69
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,240
 - So this is Popeye, we obviously know the great,

70
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,640
 (speaking in foreign language)

71
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,640
 - I think that was the chicken.

72
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,780
 - That was the chicken, was that the chicken?

73
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:56,960
 - So Popeye the sailor man,

74
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,040
 and he was a cartoon back in the early 1900s,

75
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,660
 and when he originally--

76
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,960
 - And also beyond, if you're remembering Popeye,

77
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,360
 and thinking, "Shit, am I that old?"

78
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,120
 He lasted even beyond the early 1900s.

79
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,160
 - I don't know if he's still on TV, he might be,

80
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,080
 but we all still know him, he's such an iconic character,

81
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,400
 and obviously he derived all of his powers from spinach,

82
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,920
 but when the comic strip that he first appeared in

83
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,920
 was happening, he wasn't a main character,

84
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,960
 he was this sort of peripheral character

85
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,920
 who was introduced to the series.

86
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,000
 And there's an episode where he finds himself

87
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,920
 hired by Olive Oil, who becomes his girlfriend

88
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,960
 and eventual wife, by her brother who's called Caster Oil,

89
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,800
 who sails a ship to Dice Island,

90
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,180
 where he intends to make a lot of money in a casino

91
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,040
 by rubbing the head of a lucky hen,

92
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,400
 and when he gets there, Popeye gets shot by someone.

93
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,040
 So the first time we ever see him

94
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,280
 getting supernatural strength is when after he's shot,

95
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,240
 this little whiffle hen comes by,

96
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,920
 and he goes, "Wow, whiffle hen."

97
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,400
 Don't know how he talks actually, I can't remember.

98
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,240
 There's something like that?

99
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,080
 - Yeah.

100
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,920
 - Ah, cock, cock, cock.

101
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,160
 And he rubs the hen's head,

102
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,640
 and then he gets the supernatural power,

103
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,700
 and he takes out the shooter with some punches,

104
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,040
 and that's the very first moment.

105
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,080
 - It was a comic strip, right?

106
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,920
 - Yeah, it was a comic strip.

107
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,840
 - So we wouldn't have known how he spoke, I guess.

108
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,320
 It was just, "Whatever's in your head is how he spoke."

109
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,160
 - That's a very nice thought.

110
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,360
 Isn't there an American restaurant called Popeyes?

111
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,200
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

112
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,040
 - Isn't there a chicken restaurant?

113
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,880
 - Oh yeah.

114
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,640
 I go in there, rubbing their chickens.

115
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,240
 (laughing)

116
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,080
 - You've been told.

117
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,560
 - Spinnich didn't come in until quite a lot later,

118
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,400
 did it?

119
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,240
 - It was a few years later, yeah.

120
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,680
 - I think it was 1932.

121
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,520
 - Yeah, yeah.

122
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,600
 - And Popeye, like you say,

123
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,400
 I think this comic book series started in the teens,

124
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,160
 the mid teens, 15 or 16,

125
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,560
 but I think Popeye became the main character

126
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,560
 in the early 20s.

127
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,040
 So until then, I think he was just relying

128
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,320
 on normal strength.

129
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,160
 - Well, he's very strong.

130
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,320
 I mean, he's very strong normally,

131
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,120
 but when he has a spirit, he gets extra strong.

132
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,760
 That's the whole point of those forearms, you know.

133
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,600
 - Yes.

134
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,440
 - Well, wait a minute,

135
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,640
 because your biceps are what make you strong.

136
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,400
 - This has always been the bewildering thing about Popeye.

137
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,440
 - So he's got massive forearms,

138
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,800
 and the muscles in your forearms

139
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,480
 are the ones that control your fingers.

140
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,320
 So he's just a brilliant pianist.

141
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,800
 (laughing)

142
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,720
 - Well, don't do a thumb war with Popeye,

143
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,160
 is what you're saying?

144
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,240
 I did not know that Popeye was Jewish.

145
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,080
 Is he?

146
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,920
 - Popeye was Jewish.

147
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,760
 Popeye was Jewish.

148
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,640
 So Elsie Seagal was the original cartoonist

149
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,480
 who drew Popeye.

150
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,520
 He was Jewish and there was a lot of,

151
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,440
 there were a lot of sort of very, very subtle Jewish references

152
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,120
 and sort of jokes in the strip.

153
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,320
 Yeah, and to such an extent that in Fascist Italy,

154
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,120
 'cause the cartoon was popular across the world.

155
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,600
 It was so, so popular.

156
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,000
 When it appeared in Fascist Italy,

157
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,720
 the creator's name, Seagal, was taken off it,

158
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,320
 because they were pessimistic and so, you know, so, yeah, yeah.

159
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,960
 But they still had to have the Popeye.

160
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,760
 - Are you saying Popeye the sailor was Jewish

161
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,280
 or that Seagal was Jewish?

162
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,120
 - Well, Seagal was Jewish and there are lots of references.

163
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,880
 It's a very sort of Jewish inflected

164
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,160
 and influenced cartoon.

165
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,200
 There's no actual scene of Popeye, you know,

166
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,640
 having Yom Kippur or whatever.

167
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,200
 (laughing)

168
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,040
 - That's amazing.

169
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,040
 'Cause weirdly, later on in the Popeye run,

170
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,920
 there was a thing where the original animators

171
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,080
 were no longer animating it and it was outsourced

172
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,800
 and it was outsourced to Prague

173
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,080
 in order for them to make the cartoon.

174
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,200
 So there was a whole series

175
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,760
 where Tom and Jerry was made in Prague and so on.

176
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,720
 And none of the animators out there had seen it.

177
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,640
 And this was because there was no money to do it.

178
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,040
 So there was a run of 13 episodes,

179
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,120
 which are often called the worst 13 episodes.

180
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,960
 - Of Popeye?

181
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,120
 - Of Tom and Jerry because no one had really seen it.

182
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,680
 But Popeye was done there as well.

183
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,480
 But the thing was, all of the people,

184
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,560
 this is a credits thing, who animated in Prague,

185
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,240
 had to have their names changed to American names

186
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,640
 because they didn't want audiences

187
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,760
 thinking a communist country at the time

188
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,000
 was infiltrating communist ideas

189
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,800
 into their Popeye and Tom and Jerry cartoon.

190
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,760
 - Also, isn't it landlocked, Chair Republic?

191
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,920
 So like, how would you have a sailor man there?

192
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,440
 - Oh, I guess in land waterways, can I?

193
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,280
 - The Danube.

194
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,160
 - The Danube, yeah, canal-based.

195
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,560
 - Popeye, Danube, man.

196
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,400
 - Yeah.

197
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,520
 Well, Mongolia has a navy, doesn't it, as well,

198
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,600
 despite being landlocked.

199
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,440
 - It does, yeah.

200
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,280
 And Bolivia as well.

201
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,520
 - And Bolivia, yeah.

202
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,800
 - Captain Von Trapp is in the sound of music.

203
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,640
 He's a, is he an admiral or something?

204
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,880
 Or a captain in the navy of the landlocked Austria?

205
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,400
 - It makes more sense if you're going to have a sailor man

206
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,480
 to have him on a coast, in a coastal country.

207
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,320
 - It's weird.

208
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,680
 You know how we normally try and blow shit wide open?

209
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,640
 We seem to have closed shit wide shut there.

210
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,480
 - Yeah.

211
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,320
 - I like it.

212
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,160
 - That's what we should do.

213
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,000
 Closed shit wide shut.

214
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,320
 (laughing)

215
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,280
 - Just on chicken rubbing, specifically,

216
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,400
 there is an Orthodox Jewish ritual called kapparot,

217
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,880
 where you wave a rooster over someone's head,

218
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,160
 and you say a particular prayer,

219
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,640
 and then you slaughter the rooster,

220
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,120
 and you get the slaughtered rooster to charity,

221
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,080
 and it's an atonement ritual for whoever's having the

222
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,920
 chicken waver over there.

223
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,760
 - Do you rub it on their heads,

224
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,600
 or your own head?

225
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,680
 - I don't think you rub it specifically.

226
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,800
 You just sort of waft it around above them.

227
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,280
 But maybe, maybe the Wiffelhen is a very subtle reference

228
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,800
 to the traditional Jewish kapparot ritual.

229
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,640
 - Yeah, it could be.

230
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,440
 - It's almost certainly not.

231
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,000
 - There's also, there was an old English bit of folklore

232
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,320
 where if you wanted to stop your baby

233
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,200
 from getting chicken pox, you would rub it with a chicken.

234
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,040
 (laughing)

235
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,240
 So it could have been that.

236
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,080
 - Right.

237
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,920
 - Yeah?

238
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,760
 I'm so glad we're on chicken rubbing stuff,

239
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,640
 'cause I actually did quite a lot of...

240
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,480
 - Chicken rubbing, right.

241
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,400
 - I can feel a personal anecdote coming up.

242
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,640
 (laughing)

243
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,960
 So chickens will sometimes flirt with each other

244
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,320
 by rubbing themselves on the ground.

245
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,160
 - Okay.

246
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,000
 - So like, yeah, yeah.

247
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,880
 So there's this thing called preening oil,

248
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,240
 which comes out of a kind of gland above the beak.

249
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,760
 And it contains lots of information about the birds' genes

250
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,240
 and about it, you know, how suitable it is

251
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,320
 as a mate and things like that.

252
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,000
 And so sometimes a cockerel will wipe itself

253
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,480
 on the ground, for example,

254
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,880
 to just show it didn't leave it sent

255
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,720
 for a prospective mate.

256
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,440
 - Like a genome sequencing act.

257
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,640
 It leaves its genome sequence on the ground

258
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,400
 for the male to look at and say,

259
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,920
 "Oh, you're not prone to sickle cell anemia.

260
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,760
 Thank God."

261
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,760
 (laughing)

262
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,440
 - Yeah, I guess so, yeah.

263
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,320
 - The Etruscans used to rub chickens.

264
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,120
 - So glad we're doing all this chicken rubbing stuff,

265
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,600
 'cause this is great.

266
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,440
 Go on, go on.

267
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,480
 - So the Etruscans, and then the Romans after them,

268
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,120
 but they used chickens for divination.

269
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,120
 They thought they were kind of quite holy.

270
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,240
 And for good luck, you would get a chicken.

271
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,720
 It was always a dead chicken that you would rub,

272
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,040
 but you would rub it for good luck.

273
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,120
 And that's probably where we get the idea

274
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,480
 of the wishbone from these guys as well.

275
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,640
 You know, like, if you cook a chicken, you get the bone out.

276
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,000
 People used to rub those little bones for luck as well.

277
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,840
 - Wow.

278
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,680
 - And that's why we do that.

279
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,880
 - And now we just snap 'em.

280
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,040
 - Now we just snap 'em.

281
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,080
 - Rub it too hard.

282
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,120
 You don't want that to happen in most rubbing situations.

283
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,440
 - So they get snapped.

284
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,440
 (laughing)

285
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,680
 - The hen in Popeye.

286
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,480
 Sorry to stop us from talking about.

287
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,120
 I've just got one more chicken rubbing paste.

288
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,960
 - Of course you do.

289
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,800
 - Yeah, yeah.

290
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,640
 No, no, please get it out.

291
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,880
 I'd hate for the...

292
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,000
 - Listener to miss out on your golden research.

293
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,960
 - Appalachian chicken rubbing rituals,

294
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,360
 and I just thought that would be a nice thing.

295
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,480
 So there are lots of Kentucky waltz superstitions.

296
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,720
 You know, when you have a waltz.

297
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,560
 - Right, yeah.

298
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,200
 - I don't know what Kentucky waltz is though.

299
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,840
 It's deep fried, isn't it?

300
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,400
 (laughing)

301
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,600
 - There are so many traditions or superstitions

302
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,720
 about what you do with your waltz

303
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,240
 to make it disappear in Kentucky specifically.

304
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,360
 Yeah, so, I mean, it's mostly rubbed something on it.

305
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,720
 So, you know, it might be a chicken gizzard

306
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,840
 or a chicken intestine,

307
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,440
 but also bacon rind,

308
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,280
 or beef steak,

309
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,440
 or one bean,

310
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,280
 or three beans.

311
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,880
 - Just don't accidentally rub two beans

312
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,720
 on it, whatever you do.

313
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,560
 - Oh, no, no.

314
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,400
 - Then you come out and waltz.

315
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,080
 - You get double waltz, yeah, yeah.

316
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,280
 Kill a cat.

317
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,360
 That's bad stuff.

318
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,040
 Take it to a graveyard at midnight,

319
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,520
 and then rub the cat on the waltz,

320
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,120
 and also it gets rid of the waltz.

321
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,080
 - It feels like you go with a one bean.

322
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,120
 (laughing)

323
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,040
 - It's a sort of step change process.

324
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,560
 You know, you try one bean out of three beans,

325
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,880
 then you kill a cat and take it to a graveyard.

326
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,760
 (laughing)

327
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,920
 Anyway.

328
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,200
 - You were gonna say on Popeye's chicken.

329
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,040
 - Sorry, Popeye, yeah.

330
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,640
 - I wanted to drag it back to Popeye, apparently.

331
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,480
 - No, no, no, that's fine.

332
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,520
 Let's do more rubbing chickens.

333
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,360
 What else you got?

334
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,240
 - Oh, sure, thank you, Dad.

335
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,240
 Well, okay, back, back, back, back.

336
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,640
 Sorry, my mistake.

337
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,200
 No, so in the cartoon,

338
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,720
 we've got this mystical chicken,

339
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,560
 but it's not the only--

340
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,400
 - In the comic strip, you mean?

341
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,240
 - Sorry, in the comic strip,

342
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,200
 and it's not the only animal in the comic strip

343
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,520
 that had these sort of paranormal mystical powers.

344
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,880
 There was also a dog called Eugene the Jeep.

345
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,560
 And this was in a 1936 Thimble Theater comic strip,

346
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,840
 and that's what Popeye was part of.

347
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,880
 - I don't think he was a dog per se.

348
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,000
 He looked like a dog.

349
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,520
 - We don't fully know what he was,

350
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,600
 and it led to one of the most existential,

351
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,640
 brilliant comic strips that I think the creator ever wrote.

352
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,840
 The headline of it was, "What's a Jeep?"

353
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,200
 Eugene the Jeep, what's a Jeep?

354
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,640
 And this is what the comic strip for kids said,

355
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,200
 "A Jeep is an animal living in a three-dimensional world,

356
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,440
 "in this case, our world,

357
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,080
 "but really belongs to a fourth-dimensional world."

358
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,920
 Here's what happened.

359
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,080
 A number of Jeep life sails were somehow forced

360
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,760
 through a dimensional barrier into our world.

361
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,200
 They combined at a favorable time

362
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,800
 with the life cells of the African hooey hound.

363
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,320
 The electrical vibrations of that hooey hound cell

364
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,680
 and the foreign cell were the same.

365
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,240
 They are a kind of kindred cell.

366
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,520
 In fact, all things are to some extent relative,

367
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,080
 whether they be this or some other world.

368
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,360
 Now you see.

369
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,960
 (audience laughing)

370
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,200
 For what, for six-year-olds, that is.

371
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,080
 He was based on a Polish person, wasn't he?

372
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,520
 Which again, Popeye was,

373
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,160
 which I imagine they'd have had to cover up

374
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,240
 when they wanted there to be

375
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,040
 none of these communist influences.

376
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,760
 But this guy sounds like a bit of a legend.

377
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,880
 Frank "Rocky" Fiegel, who was from Segar's hometown.

378
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,200
 So he lived in Chester, Illinois,

379
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,080
 which is where Segar came from.

380
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,400
 But his parents were Polish immigrants.

381
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,720
 And there's one remaining photo of him,

382
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,720
 and he does look like Popeye, but it's very hard to tell

383
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,560
 'cause he's basically got a pipe

384
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,880
 and he's bald.

385
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,720
 And so--

386
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,640
 - I think he definitely looks like Popeye.

387
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,720
 - He looks like Popeye,

388
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,920
 and he was constantly getting into fights,

389
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,200
 and, which basically is what Popeye does, right?

390
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,360
 He smokes, he gets into fights.

391
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,800
 - Well, he was a boxer, wasn't he, I think?

392
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,720
 - He was a boxer, but and a nice guy, though.

393
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,200
 Constantly starting fights,

394
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,520
 but a nice guy and always protected the children.

395
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,080
 - We're talking about the sailor now, right?

396
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,640
 - We're talking about Fiegel, the sailor.

397
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,120
 And apparently, according to his biographies--

398
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,320
 - Sorry, that Popeye is a sailor as well.

399
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,480
 - Oh, sorry, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry.

400
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,360
 - He did actually say at the very start,

401
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,120
 "Popeye the sailor."

402
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,560
 - Quite specifically, you see why I added it now, Andy.

403
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,240
 - And actually, this guy wasn't a sailor.

404
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,360
 - The Polish-- what?

405
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,480
 - No, he wasn't a sailor.

406
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,400
 He was just a down and up guy.

407
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,360
 - So just a guy who liked getting into fights

408
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,360
 is the inspiration.

409
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,200
 - Yeah, okay.

410
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,120
 - Maybe he didn't spend so much time

411
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,080
 checking out a rubbing chicken patch, you know?

412
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,760
 - But he used to get sent money, apparently.

413
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,280
 His assistant, Seagal's assistant,

414
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,680
 said they used to send him a little bit of money

415
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,040
 to say thanks for inspiring the character of Popeye.

416
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:24,880
 - Wow.

417
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,800
 - Seagal said this to the Randolph County Herald newspaper

418
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,280
 that it was based on this guy.

419
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,680
 And there was another person in the town

420
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,600
 called John William Shushet,

421
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,480
 who was supposedly what Wimpy was based on.

422
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,320
 - Oh, yeah.

423
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,160
 - So you know Wimpy, the character

424
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,000
 who's, "I gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today,"

425
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,840
 and all that.

426
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,760
 He's always in debt and he's always eaten hamburgers.

427
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,720
 And according to this historian,

428
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,000
 John William Shushet also liked hamburgers.

429
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,560
 - Interesting.

430
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,080
 - Open and shut case.

431
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,800
 - Shut this shit in my clothes.

432
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,640
 (audience laughing)

433
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,640
 - His name means joke, sweetly.

434
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,480
 - Seagal.

435
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,320
 - Or figure.

436
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,160
 - Oh, yeah.

437
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,000
 - His name is prank or joke.

438
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,840
 - Oh, yeah.

439
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,680
 - Which is kind of what Popeye is.

440
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,520
 - That was pretty funny.

441
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,360
 - A comic strip.

442
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,440
 - Well, there is a serious point behind Popeye.

443
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,720
 So there was a psychoanalytic piece done about him

444
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,760
 in an American paper in 1932.

445
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,720
 This is a paper called The Post Dispatch.

446
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,840
 It was a really, really famous paper at the time.

447
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,880
 You may not realize it,

448
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,800
 but Popeye is a suppressed desire.

449
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,880
 He personifies the desire most of us have

450
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,360
 both to be strong and to sock

451
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,480
 some of the unpleasant people we encounter.

452
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,120
 A desire suppressed because we lack Popeye's muscles.

453
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,960
 (audience groans)

454
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,680
 - Although Popeye himself says

455
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,920
 he would never hit anyone as hard as he could

456
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,480
 'cause it's wrong to kill people.

457
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,280
 There's actually quite a sweet.

458
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,200
 - Wait, there's the cartoon character now.

459
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,400
 - Yeah, yeah, the cartoon character.

460
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,240
 - Okay, okay.

461
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,080
 - The cartoon character wrote a letter

462
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,680
 to a paper in the 1930s saying,

463
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,960
 and I suppose Seagull probably helped him write it,

464
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,040
 saying he'd never hit anyone as hard as he could

465
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,160
 because it's wrong to kill people.

466
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,460
 And he said he's been shot 120 times,

467
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,600
 but when bullets go through him,

468
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,920
 it doesn't bother him at all,

469
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,960
 except that he always has to block up the hole

470
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,520
 with a cork 'cause he doesn't like drafts

471
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,600
 blowing through him.

472
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,560
 (audience laughs)

473
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,400
 - Beautiful.

474
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,640
 - Yeah, people complained about the fighting

475
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,840
 'cause it was teaching kids to fight.

476
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,880
 So after that, he carried on fighting,

477
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,160
 but only for the honor of old ladies and children.

478
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,840
 Later strips.

479
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,920
 - Children have honor.

480
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,600
 (audience laughs)

481
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,640
 - Yeah.

482
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,400
 - I guess so, original honor.

483
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,240
 - All right, yeah.

484
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,080
 - Old babies have.

485
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,080
 - But he was really positive for spinach eating at the time.

486
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,920
 - Yeah.

487
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,800
 - There were reports, and I don't know how accurate they were,

488
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,120
 but during the Great Depression,

489
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,440
 they said that the uptake in children

490
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,900
 who were interested in eating food like spinach,

491
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,040
 well, specifically spinach, was 33%.

492
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,060
 And that bumped it up to sort of like the third most

493
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,760
 requested food or favorite food of a child during that time.

494
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,840
 - Yeah, the insane claim is that there was a survey done

495
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,520
 which asked children what they liked to eat.

496
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,760
 Their first thing was turkey,

497
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,000
 and their second thing was ice cream,

498
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,600
 and then they claimed spinach.

499
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,440
 - Yeah.

500
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,480
 - So it was seems very important.

501
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,800
 (audience laughs)

502
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,480
 - And then Popeye later on in the cartoons,

503
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,280
 he stopped eating the spinach directly out of the can.

504
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,520
 So you know he would like squeeze the can in the,

505
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,680
 but apparently they were worried that children

506
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,000
 might copy this and might get a can of spinach

507
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,840
 and eat directly from it and cut their mouth.

508
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,680
 - Oh, really?

509
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,760
 - Yeah.

510
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,720
 - Yeah, that's the kind of thing I would have done,

511
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,760
 actually, I think that's fair.

512
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,400
 - I need to move us on to our next comment.

513
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,520
 - Can we mention very quickly the madness of the film,

514
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,200
 Popeye, which is just one thing about it.

515
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,280
 So there's the Robin Williams film, 1980,

516
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,120
 and it's not very good, apparently.

517
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:32,960
 I haven't seen it.

518
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,800
 - It's absolutely brilliant.

519
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,640
 I've seen it five times.

520
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,600
 It's really good.

521
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,320
 It's a classic, Robin Williams' first film.

522
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,160
 It's amazing.

523
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,000
 - Yeah, agreed.

524
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,840
 It's great.

525
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,680
 - It's mad.

526
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,520
 - All right, it's two against one.

527
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,340
 - It's insane.

528
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,180
 - But I have better taste.

529
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,000
 No, I haven't seen it, so it might be great.

530
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,720
 But anyway, the crazy thing about it

531
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,880
 is what it was like to film it.

532
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,920
 So the producer was a guy called Robert Evans.

533
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,320
 Everyone who worked tonight admits

534
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,520
 that they were basically rolling in cocaine

535
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,240
 the entire time.

536
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,800
 And at one point,

537
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,560
 and they were all bringing cocaine on set,

538
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,000
 they'd open up like camera packs

539
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,080
 and just cocaine would fall out of cameras.

540
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,320
 - I haven't seen this film either,

541
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,280
 but is that what he does instead of spinach?

542
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,120
 - Yeah.

543
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,360
 - Yes, it is, yeah.

544
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:13,280
 And Robert Evans had some luggage that was full of cocaine

545
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,720
 that he was bringing with him to the set.

546
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,120
 And it went missing at the airport,

547
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,360
 as bags sometimes do.

548
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,040
 And he thought, oh, shit.

549
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,360
 A, we're not gonna get our Coke.

550
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,920
 And B, if someone finds that luggage, I'm in trouble.

551
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,760
 And so what he did was he basically

552
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,960
 convinced the Maltese Prime Minister at the time,

553
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,640
 a guy called Dominic Mintoff,

554
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,760
 to do an exhaustive search of basically the country

555
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,560
 to try and find his bags.

556
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,600
 And so Mintoff said, "Why on earth would I do that?"

557
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,480
 And he said, "Ah, well, I'm very good friends

558
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,760
 "with Henry Kissinger,

559
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,040
 "and Kissinger's written you a personal note,

560
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,080
 "which is inside that luggage."

561
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,920
 And I'd really love to give it to you.

562
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,800
 So it's really important that we track it down

563
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,560
 so you can read his lovely letter.

564
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,040
 So he did.

565
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,600
 His ego was flattered enough.

566
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,680
 He tracked it down for him.

567
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,480
 And then immediately, as soon as he'd done it,

568
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,680
 Robert Evans had to fly back to the US,

569
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,680
 meet up with Henry Kissinger,

570
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,200
 and say, "Look, Henry, I'm so sorry,

571
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,320
 "but you have to write a fake letter

572
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,080
 "to the leader of Malta,

573
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,720
 "saying what a great guy he is.

574
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,040
 "Long story short, cocaine luggage situation.

575
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,080
 "Do you mind?"

576
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,800
 And Kissinger was very reluctant,

577
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,640
 'cause Mintoff was an ally of Gaddafi.

578
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,920
 It would have been very weird for him

579
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,200
 to write an affectionate letter,

580
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,440
 but he capitulated to save the shit/good film.

581
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,000
 He wrote a fake letter.

582
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,840
 Did he really?

583
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,440
 Well, it sounds like he wrote... just wrote a letter.

584
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,280
 He wrote a letter.

585
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,120
 If you're Henry Kissinger and you are writing a letter,

586
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:31,960
 that's a letter.

587
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,720
 I guess it's fake. He backdated it.

588
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,720
 Oh, OK, that is fake.

589
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,520
 Oh, yeah, that's because I did a fakery.

590
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,160
 It's mad.

591
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,680
 I've just got a few more facts about chicken rubbing.

592
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,000
 We don't have time, Andy.

593
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,120
 MUSIC

594
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,760
 It is time for fact number two,

595
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,320
 and that is Anna.

596
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,680
 My fact this week is that Marcel Proust

597
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,720
 once woke up the members of a famous string quartet at midnight

598
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,720
 and made them all come back to his house

599
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,520
 to play a specific piece for him.

600
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,960
 Because he... Oh, wow, that's so cool.

601
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,120
 It's such a cool thing to be able to do.

602
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,880
 And this is before he was even really famous.

603
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,800
 How did he do that?

604
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,000
 He just, I guess, people were more willing to do shit

605
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 back in the day.

606
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,760
 It was sort of pre-telephones, right, this period?

607
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,760
 Yeah, you know...

608
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,000
 Not everyone's got a telephone.

609
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,600
 Well, no one's calling them.

610
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,960
 Yeah, he's going around to their house.

611
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,280
 Yeah, so four individual houses in the middle of the night

612
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,200
 to wake them up.

613
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,480
 It's 11 p.m. He loved chamber music.

614
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,600
 It's crazier than the Kissinger letter, I think.

615
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,280
 I don't know how you would organise that.

616
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,600
 Basically, at 11 p.m. he thought,

617
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:43,800
 "I'd love to listen to César Franc's String Quartet in D Major.

618
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,280
 "And nothing will stop me."

619
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,120
 And so he knocked on the door of the leading French violinist

620
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,000
 in Paris at the time, Gaston Poulet,

621
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,400
 who was in his pyjamas and answered the door.

622
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,520
 And Proust said, "I've got a taxi waiting downstairs.

623
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,040
 "We're going to pick up your three mates

624
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,400
 "and you're going to play me this piece."

625
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,080
 And so, yeah, he went around all their houses.

626
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,560
 One of them, the violist, was sceptical, apparently,

627
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,200
 because Proust was...

628
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,720
 He was wrapped in a big blanket

629
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,520
 and he was eating mashed potato.

630
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:12,680
 The whole time, in his cab.

631
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,120
 But they all got in.

632
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,840
 Proust had a very weird life.

633
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,840
 Shall we just say, Proust is...

634
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,840
 Lots of new years, yeah.

635
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,560
 So, author of one of the greatest,

636
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,640
 certainly one of the longest novels ever written,

637
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,520
 Alasherst de Tompeh do in Search of Lost Time.

638
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,560
 And, you know, that's about it.

639
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,160
 All that was his main thing,

640
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,240
 because he spent a long time writing it and then he died.

641
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,000
 And a huge eccentric in that he...

642
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,800
 His eccentricities were sort of half-born out

643
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,520
 of the illnesses that he had in his life.

644
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,120
 But he famously wrote all these books in bed.

645
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,760
 He rarely went to sleep.

646
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,240
 He was allergic to dust.

647
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,400
 He was allergic to so many things.

648
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,280
 He had cork walls on his room at home

649
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,680
 because he tried to keep out any allergies from getting to him.

650
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,600
 He had really bad asthma, didn't he,

651
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,640
 which he took cigarettes for.

652
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,320
 Yeah. Classic.

653
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,040
 I've already had up to ten asthma attacks a day,

654
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,560
 each one lasting up to an hour.

655
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,640
 Yeah. Wow.

656
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,800
 It's unbelievable that he wrote one of the longer books ever written,

657
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,080
 considering how much time he just spent having asthma, basically.

658
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,760
 Yeah. But that was the thing.

659
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,880
 By then, you would get these cigarettes,

660
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,600
 and they would have, like, opium in them and stuff.

661
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,280
 So, you know, they weren't that bad,

662
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,440
 but they were going into your lungs.

663
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,840
 But, yeah. And you said about telephones, Dan.

664
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,680
 So, it was... They did have telephones, then.

665
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,320
 They weren't, obviously, super popular,

666
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,280
 but it was a time... Do you remember we talked about this music

667
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,440
 that used to play through the telephone?

668
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,360
 Yeah, that's right. In America, the... Yeah.

669
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,720
 It's like the first Spotify, in a way.

670
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,240
 Exactly. They had this in France, and Proust had it,

671
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,400
 because he was in bed the whole time. Wow.

672
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,400
 And so, he had this kind of wires set up to an earpiece,

673
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,000
 and he would listen to music.

674
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,880
 So, hang on. When you woke up the members of the String Quartet,

675
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:49,280
 he literally had functioning opera coming into his room.

676
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,320
 It wasn't that functioning, to be honest.

677
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:54,600
 Like, there was one time when there was a really loud crowd,

678
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,600
 and he thought that that was the song,

679
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,560
 because you couldn't really tell what was happening.

680
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,520
 So, everyone was cheering. He was, "Oh, that was beautiful."

681
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,040
 And they were like, "No, no, that wasn't the song."

682
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,360
 But this was called the Theatrophon,

683
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,480
 and it was very popular in France at the time.

684
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,720
 Also very popular in Budapest.

685
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:14,600
 And there was Harper's Weekly said that this system in Budapest

686
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,480
 had made it the city that was full of illiterate, blind, bedridden

687
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,360
 and incurably lazy people,

688
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,040
 because they were all at home just listening to this music.

689
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,360
 That feels like quite a personal...

690
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,240
 That's a bit of a sub-tweet on Proust himself, isn't it?

691
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,920
 I mean, that's what he was... Well, it was a little bit, yeah.

692
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,920
 I think they were more slugging off the entire city of Budapest.

693
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,920
 Oh, yeah.

694
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:39,920
 So, Proust's sort of habits when he was writing.

695
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,600
 So, he went to bed in 1909,

696
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,680
 and he basically stayed there until 19... I think, 22?

697
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,200
 22, I think he's 19.

698
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,000
 And he wrote for 13 years, and one of his...

699
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,040
 And also, he couldn't get a publisher.

700
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,360
 He wrote the first volume, really struggled to get it published.

701
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,920
 No publishers were interested.

702
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,360
 He had to self-publish it, you know, at his own expense.

703
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:01,600
 I think he inherited quite a lot of money, so he was quite well-healed.

704
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,120
 And there was one person who believed in him and championed the work

705
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,240
 and wrote a lot of brilliant, you know, reviews saying,

706
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,440
 "You have to read this author. He is changing the face of literature."

707
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:17,280
 And that person was Marcel Proust, under an assumed name.

708
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,280
 Really?

709
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,080
 He paid for his own early reviews in lots of newspapers.

710
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,720
 Yeah, he wrote them in longhand,

711
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,760
 and then he secretly had them typed up by his publisher,

712
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,120
 so there was no paper trail.

713
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,080
 And he described his own work as a little masterpiece.

714
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:33,720
 He said, "What Monsieur Proust sees and feels is completely original."

715
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:39,040
 I always think of it as the French trying to get one up on the British and Irish,

716
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:42,680
 because I feel like we have James Joyce,

717
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:46,600
 and there's this impenetrable, you know, 1,000-plus-page tome

718
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,080
 that we all attempt to get through at some point and then mostly fail.

719
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,560
 And then they have Proust, where they just did that.

720
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:56,080
 And then he wrote six more volumes, exactly the same on top of it.

721
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:01,400
 Well, I think Proust came first, or certainly his first book was published before Joyce.

722
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,520
 Because, like Candy says, it was self-published,

723
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,120
 but he went to a publisher to try and get it published,

724
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,400
 this guy called Gaston Gallimard.

725
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,160
 And Gallimard passed it on to a reader, and the reader just, it was really long,

726
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,160
 so he just opened it up on a random page, page 62,

727
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:21,440
 and what he found was a boring and overwritten description of a cup of herbal tea.

728
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,960
 [LAUGHTER]

729
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,200
 So he declined it, and then Proust had to do the self-publishing thing.

730
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,480
 But then, 10 years later, Gallimard got another novel.

731
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,400
 It was a very long Irish novel, and it was James Joyce's Ulysses, so...

732
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,560
 Because I already regretted it for years,

733
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,920
 like the guy who turned down the Beatles.

734
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,560
 He apologized, yeah, he did apologize afterwards, yeah.

735
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,600
 They did meet once.

736
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,560
 Proust and James Joyce.

737
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,000
 Yeah, 1922, it was the year that he died.

738
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,120
 But it was one of the few times he actually went out, I think,

739
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,280
 and he went to a dinner party, and James Joyce was there.

740
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,880
 And then all I know is, I think James Joyce got quite pissed

741
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,120
 and tried to invite himself back to Proust's house,

742
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,320
 and Proust had to sneak away.

743
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,080
 But do you have more detail?

744
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,680
 Well, all I've read about the encounter

745
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,680
 is that they hadn't actually read each other's books.

746
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,280
 Oh, yeah, really?

747
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,880
 One of the counter of two of the greatest minds ever.

748
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,080
 They had nothing to say.

749
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,080
 That's so funny.

750
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,600
 There was a guy, before he wrote his mega series of books,

751
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,760
 he translated a couple of books, and Ruskin,

752
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,920
 he was a huge fan of Ruskin, right?

753
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,480
 And when Ruskin passed away,

754
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,200
 Proust decided that he wanted to make French translations

755
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,680
 of two of the books, except he didn't speak any English.

756
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,440
 So he had to ask his mum to translate it for him.

757
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,520
 And then he did a proper, better translation

758
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,640
 of his mum's translation of the book.

759
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,800
 Oh, my God, he bloody loved his mum.

760
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,120
 My God, if anyone's a mummy's boy.

761
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,840
 Yeah, 'cause he lived with his parents until they both died,

762
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,240
 which is fine.

763
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,840
 And he used to write letters to his mum from bed

764
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:46,120
 when he couldn't sleep saying, you know, "Mother, I'm so sorry,

765
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,960
 "I won't be able to get up and spend breakfast with you,

766
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,520
 "and nothing would make me happier."

767
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,480
 2,000 pages later, he won't get to the point.

768
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,320
 But his dad was quite strange,

769
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,760
 and subjected him to this quite strange experience

770
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,480
 when he was about 16,

771
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,200
 which was that he was very worried about his son,

772
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,920
 Marcel's masturbation, and...

773
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,760
 Too much, not enough, yeah.

774
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,520
 I just didn't think he was doing enough.

775
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,720
 Doing it weird.

776
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,160
 I thought you'd have this fact.

777
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,000
 Love the rubbing cock facts.

778
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,600
 (LAUGHTER)

779
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:21,680
 There were no chickens involved,

780
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,240
 but he was a doctor, Dr. Adrian Proust,

781
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,280
 and it was a time when people thought masturbation was bad,

782
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:32,840
 and Dr. Proust thought that it could lead to homosexuality,

783
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,400
 'cause Proust was gay, in fact,

784
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,040
 and so I think that his parents might have thought,

785
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,000
 "Oh, God, we think he might be gay."

786
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,120
 And so they said to cure him when he was 16.

787
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,440
 His dad gave him 10 francs, sent him to a brothel,

788
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,160
 and said, "Here you go, have sex with a prostitute,

789
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:50,760
 "at female, please, and that will stop this awful masturbation habit."

790
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,640
 -10 francs? -Yeah.

791
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,120
 -So much that, is it? I don't know. -Well, back in the day,

792
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,760
 you're not going to splash out on the first experience,

793
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,960
 'cause it's got nothing to do with it. -Don't be disgusting, Anna.

794
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,080
 Well, speaking of which he didn't, it was a failure.

795
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,320
 This is why we know about it,

796
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:09,360
 'cause Marcel Proust wrote a letter to his grandfather the next day,

797
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,200
 saying, "I'm really sorry, I need to borrow 13 francs off you.

798
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,280
 "Papa gave me 10 francs so I can get rid of this dreadful masturbation habit.

799
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,200
 "But what I did was I turned up,

800
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,280
 "I broke the prostitute's three franc chamber pot, embarrassing,

801
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,960
 "and then I was so embarrassed that I couldn't perform,

802
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,080
 "and so now I need to go back and try again,

803
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,680
 "but I also need to pay her for her chamber pot."

804
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,680
 -So... -Amazing.

805
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,160
 Poor guy.

806
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:41,000
 We have this impression of him as very sort of ill and constantly retiring to his bed.

807
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,760
 -He did once fight a duel in his life. -Oh, yeah.

808
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,240
 Yeah, and it was clearly something that mattered to him a lot.

809
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:51,280
 He fought a duel when someone accused him of being gay, of having had a gay affair.

810
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,680
 And his accuser was a literary critic who was called Jean Lorraine,

811
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:59,320
 who was also gay, so to be clear, this is two gay guys having a duel

812
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,760
 because one of them said to the other, "You are gay."

813
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:06,120
 -Yeah. -And they both survived, didn't they?

814
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,240
 -They both survived, they both shot and... -They both missed.

815
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,640
 Marcel shot first, he went in the sort of region of his feet,

816
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,960
 but didn't get him, and the other guy missed outright.

817
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,120
 -But you kind of, I guess, have to think about the times. -Of course, yeah.

818
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:21,960
 He was outing him for something that might have got him killed anyway

819
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,240
 for being a homosexual, maybe his dad having written what he wrote was a...

820
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,000
 -Yeah, it's... -It was a tough show.

821
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,560
 He had a tough life, didn't he, Marcel, or Marcel?

822
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,560
 -Yeah. -Yeah.

823
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,120
 He once diagnosed himself with a brain disorder

824
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,120
 and said that the only way to cure it was by drilling loads of holes into his skull.

825
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,720
 -Oh, dear. -Did he do that?

826
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,000
 He begged a doctor to do it, and the doctor, quite responsible for doctors at the time,

827
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,200
 said, "I'm not going to do that."

828
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,600
 -Yeah. -Well, in fairness, that's around 1910, that was standard.

829
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,640
 -Mm-hmm. -Yeah, they were trapanning around that time.

830
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,680
 -Yeah. -Oh, yeah, yeah, someone won a Nobel Prize for it.

831
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,720
 -That's right, they did, yeah. -The main, main character

832
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:03,040
 in Alarashesh Tapatopadu was going to be the Madeleine.

833
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,640
 So the whole point of it is... Not the whole point, but I read the very start,

834
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,800
 he's kind of got this Madeleine cake, and he has a bite of it,

835
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,680
 and suddenly he remembers all the history and things that happened

836
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,360
 because this evoked such a memory from him.

837
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,760
 -So I thought I'd look into Madeleines. -Oh, yeah.

838
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,520
 Apparently invented by a young girl called Madeleine,

839
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,360
 who stood in for the chef to the Duke of Lorraine.

840
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,760
 We're not quite sure why, but the chef wasn't there,

841
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,760
 and they were like, "You, in."

842
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:34,720
 And she only knew one recipe, and that was her grandmother's recipe for cakes,

843
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,920
 and so that's all she made, and so she just made loads and loads of these,

844
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,040
 and they were named after her, apparently.

845
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,920
 And in 2006, there was a thing called Café Europa,

846
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:47,920
 it was an EU thing, where every country in Europe

847
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:51,920
 had to give their best cake or their best sweet thing,

848
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:55,320
 and then they would celebrate them all, and France gave them Madeleine.

849
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:58,400
 -Really? Because they're quite crap. -Oh, really?

850
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,280
 Yeah, they're just... Do you guys know what they are?

851
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,400
 -They're like a little sponge cake. -I've not had one.

852
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,200
 You would have had one. They're just so boring.

853
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,400
 You idiot, Dan. Of course you've had one.

854
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,560
 Ironically, they're very easy to forget.

855
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,480
 Yes.

856
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,480
 They're like a tiny little sponge cake.

857
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:17,320
 They're shaped like a scallop, a shell, you know, a seashell.

858
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,400
 -They're shaped like that. -Yeah, yeah, okay.

859
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,400
 But in the original book, it was a bit of toast, originally.

860
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,160
 I thought, "This needs a rewrite."

861
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,480
 I just wondered if you wanted to guess some other countries

862
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,400
 -and what they did for their sweet things. -Oh, my God, yeah.

863
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,720
 Because France has so much France, it's the land of cakes, you know?

864
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,120
 The Eclair. I would have submitted the Eclair.

865
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,080
 Well, you didn't. Have they didn't?

866
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,080
 Yeah. Did they win? Did they win with the Madeleine?

867
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,120
 It wasn't a competition. It was just like...

868
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,680
 What's the point of it, then? What is it?

869
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,800
 What's the point of anything if it isn't a competition?

870
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,800
 You know, this isn't a competition, Andy.

871
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,800
 No one wins this out of the four of us at the end.

872
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,920
 Don't be ridiculous. We've been scoring for the last 450 episodes.

873
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,840
 -I'm definitely confident. -I actually can imagine Andy going home

874
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,920
 and having a little white barge when he puts that in.

875
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,920
 Another great win, Andy. Well done.

876
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:02,200
 The soul metric is a number of chicken-rubbing references

877
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,200
 made throughout the show.

878
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,200
 OK, so what other countries have made it?

879
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,800
 I mean, yeah, just that. They're all relatively easy to guess. Belgium.

880
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,200
 -It has to be a sweet thing. -Croissant?

881
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,800
 -Croissants in Belgium. -Sweet chips.

882
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,720
 Sweet chips.

883
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,800
 Like, honey... Honeyfried.

884
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,400
 -Waffles. -Waffles, waffles, waffles.

885
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,400
 Portugal, pastel de nata, for instance.

886
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,400
 Don't give it all away. Don't give it all away.

887
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,400
 I just thought we'd go straight, maybe, to the UK.

888
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,400
 Can you guess what the UK gets? Bloody hell.

889
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,400
 Oh, that sort of pink Tottenham cake that you get in Gregg's.

890
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,400
 It's very nice.

891
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,400
 It's so nice.

892
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,400
 I don't know what that is.

893
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,400
 I'm pretty sure it wasn't from Gregg's.

894
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,400
 OK, OK. Victoria's sponge cake.

895
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,400
 No, no.

896
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,400
 Thick Norf.

897
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,400
 -Thick Norf? -Thick Norf?

898
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,400
 -Oh, those buns. -Fervent Norf.

899
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,400
 -Scottish... -Scottish roll.

900
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,400
 [LAUGHTER]

901
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,400
 A Scotch egg.

902
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,400
 They misunderstood the category and they gave a Scotch egg.

903
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,400
 A deep-fried Mars bar.

904
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,400
 [LAUGHTER]

905
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,400
 -A haggis. -A haggis.

906
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,400
 -A sweet haggis. -A sweet...

907
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,400
 What, and sausage roll was fine?

908
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,400
 -You said sausage roll. -That was me?

909
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,400
 Oh, my God.

910
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,400
 It was shortbread.

911
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,400
 Oh, OK.

912
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,400
 And Denmark went for the Danish pastry,

913
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,400
 even though they were invented in Austria.

914
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,400
 -Ooh. -Sneaky.

915
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,400
 And who won?

916
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,400
 [LAUGHTER]

917
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,400
 I think the Madeleine bit

918
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,400
 is really only famous because

919
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,400
 it's so near the beginning.

920
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,400
 It's the only bit anyone's got to.

921
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,400
 I have to say I have read

922
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,400
 and intend to when I have

923
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,400
 a period of time off next year.

924
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,400
 Read properly, but I researched it on Purdue

925
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,400
 because I think people are really hard on it,

926
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,400
 even at the time they said it was impenetrable.

927
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,400
 And I think it's really fun to read from the 40 pages I read.

928
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,400
 But the Madeleine does come up within those 40 pages,

929
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,400
 and it's not that relevant after that.

930
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,400
 But he did, it shows how much he agonised

931
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,400
 over everything, that as you said, Andy,

932
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,400
 it was a piece of toast for a bit.

933
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,400
 It was also a piece of stale bread,

934
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,400
 which is quite, I don't know why you would eat that.

935
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,400
 It was...

936
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,400
 It was a sausage roll at one stage, wasn't it?

937
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,400
 [LAUGHTER]

938
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,400
 OK, it is time

939
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,400
 for fact number three,

940
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,400
 and that is Andy.

941
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,400
 My fact is that in the 1920s,

942
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,400
 a smart young man would have two handkerchiefs,

943
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,400
 a blower and a shower.

944
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,400
 [LAUGHTER]

945
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,400
 Yeah.

946
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,400
 It's disgusting.

947
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,400
 It's disgusting.

948
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,400
 What's the difference between them?

949
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,400
 Yes, there is a difference.

950
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,400
 So, I got this from, I was reading an old novel

951
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,400
 called Green Banks by Dorothy Whipple,

952
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,400
 which is great, she's great,

953
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,400
 and there's a scene in it where there's a young man

954
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,400
 waiting for his girlfriend,

955
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,400
 and he talks about having his blower in his shower,

956
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,400
 and I just peaked my interest.

957
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,400
 [LAUGHTER]

958
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,400
 It's very funny.

959
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,400
 It's hard to google.

960
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,400
 So, the shower is the one you have

961
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,400
 in your top pocket, the sort of pocket square

962
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,400
 that looks incredibly neat and jazzy,

963
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,400
 and then the blower is the one

964
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,400
 you keep up your sleeve with all the snot on it,

965
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,400
 and that's the difference between them.

966
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,400
 Could the shower become a blower?

967
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,400
 Oh, yes.

968
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,400
 Absolutely.

969
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,400
 But you couldn't make a blower a shower, could you?

970
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,400
 No. No.

971
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,400
 You can blow a shower, but you can't show a blower.

972
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,400
 [LAUGHTER]

973
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,400
 I disagree.

974
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,400
 It depends on where you're blowing on the blower.

975
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,400
 If you blow on the blower in, like, a top corner,

976
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,400
 and then you fold it down, half of it,

977
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,400
 it's like an iceberg, a shower.

978
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,400
 There's a lot of it below the surface area.

979
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,400
 Well, okay.

980
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,400
 Yeah, just don't blow on the show bit of your blower.

981
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,400
 But it could start to come through the pocket, you know, like...

982
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,400
 How?

983
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,400
 If you've got enough... How stocky are you?

984
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,400
 If you've got that cold, then you don't want

985
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,400
 to snot seeping out of the bottom of your pocket

986
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,400
 with the shower proudly seeping out the top.

987
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,400
 No, that's true. Yeah.

988
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,400
 I say keep them separate. I say keep them separate.

989
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,400
 Dan's the one who's proposed this Maverick system where you can...

990
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,400
 [LAUGHTER]

991
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,400
 But it's rare, this usage of these phrases,

992
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,400
 but it did exist at the time.

993
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,400
 It crops up in the New York Times in 1927,

994
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,400
 and it's a report about the handkerchief

995
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,400
 being something from ancient China, you know, originally,

996
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,400
 the only show was not blowers.

997
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,400
 And it didn't used to be for that, did it?

998
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,400
 We only actually started blowing anything into handkerchiefs

999
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,400
 in about 400 years ago.

1000
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,400
 And it seems like a long time ago.

1001
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,400
 But we had handkerchiefs long before that,

1002
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,400
 or kerchiefs, which are just...

1003
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,400
 It's just a word for something that wraps

1004
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,400
 around your head, in fact.

1005
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,400
 A headkerchief?

1006
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,400
 Well, this is what's so weird.

1007
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,400
 A kerchief is literally a head covering,

1008
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,400
 chief head, and then ker was covering.

1009
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,400
 And so now we have a hand-head covering,

1010
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,400
 is the word?

1011
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,400
 Is a head covering you hold in your hand, basically.

1012
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,400
 Yeah.

1013
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,400
 I always thought that kerchief,

1014
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,400
 when people say it, as they often do,

1015
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,400
 was an abbreviation of handkerchief.

1016
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,400
 Didn't know it had gone the other way.

1017
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,400
 We know the first person, possibly,

1018
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,400
 who blew their nose on a handkerchief.

1019
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,400
 Kidding, really? What?

1020
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,400
 Well, we know the first person who wrote about it.

1021
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,400
 And this was a guy called Desiderius Erasmus,

1022
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,400
 who we have mentioned once or twice before.

1023
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,400
 The philosopher?

1024
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,400
 The philosopher and religious scholar.

1025
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,400
 But he also, and we have said this before,

1026
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,400
 he wrote a best-selling book

1027
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,400
 on etiquette.

1028
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,400
 And at one stage, it was a best-selling book

1029
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,400
 in the whole of Europe for dozens and dozens,

1030
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,400
 if not 100 years after the Bible.

1031
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,400
 Basically, the Bible and then this.

1032
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,400
 And in this book, it said stuff like,

1033
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,400
 "Do not be afraid of vomiting.

1034
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,400
 It is not vomiting, but holding vomits

1035
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,400
 in your throat that's foul."

1036
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,400
 Mmm.

1037
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,400
 Politely disagree.

1038
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,400
 OK. Well, let's see.

1039
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,400
 Having been up and down some high streets

1040
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,400
 on an early Sunday morning,

1041
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,400
 sometimes you do wish people had held it

1042
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,400
 in their throat a bit.

1043
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,400
 He also said, "If you cannot swallow

1044
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,400
 a piece of food, turn around discreetly

1045
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,400
 and throw it somewhere."

1046
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,400
 Oh, that is good advice.

1047
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,400
 That's good. And finally,

1048
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,400
 "Do not move back and forth on your chair.

1049
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,400
 Whoever does that gives the impression

1050
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,400
 of constantly breaking or trying

1051
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,400
 to break wind."

1052
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,400
 Just America.

1053
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,400
 Oh, I think it was him, sorry,

1054
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,400
 who said, "Because this was just about the time

1055
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,400
 when handkerchiefs were starting to be blown

1056
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,400
 noses on."

1057
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,400
 Have noses blown on them.

1058
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,400
 And so, some didn't, some didn't.

1059
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,400
 And he said, "If you need to blow your nose,

1060
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,400
 you can do it on the floor, not a table."

1061
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,400
 On the floor? On the floor? Yeah.

1062
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,400
 Blow your nose on the floor? Oh, right.

1063
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,400
 Put your finger to your nostril and blow it

1064
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,400
 in the direction. Yeah, sorry.

1065
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,400
 You don't have to rub your face against the floor.

1066
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,400
 Yeah, exactly.

1067
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,400
 But he said, "If it is visible,

1068
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,400
 you do have to keep stepping over it

1069
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,400
 and on it until it's gone away."

1070
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,400
 Yeah. And he was basically, because people

1071
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,400
 were doing that or wiping out on their clothes

1072
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,400
 and he said, "This was an improvement," which I think

1073
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,400
 even Andy will admit. Yeah.

1074
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,400
 The handkerchief? Yeah. Definitely an improvement.

1075
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,400
 No, no, they're blowing on the floor compared to blowing on your clothes

1076
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,400
 because I would say blowing, I'd probably do a subtle blow

1077
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,400
 into my cuff rather than onto the floor, wouldn't you?

1078
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,400
 Depends on the scale of the blow.

1079
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,400
 Yeah, it depends. I just think it's completely...

1080
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,400
 Sounds like with your leaking handkerchiefs

1081
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,400
 as a dangerous manoeuvre.

1082
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,400
 There was a thing that I read, which is that

1083
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,400
 there was a period where people weren't carrying

1084
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,400
 two handkerchiefs on them, but 30.

1085
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,400
 This was actually as part of

1086
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,400
 defence against

1087
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,400
 bullets. So what this was is,

1088
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,400
 in the late 1800s,

1089
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,400
 there was a physician called George E. Goodfellow.

1090
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,400
 He lived in Tomb Zone, Arizona,

1091
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,400
 or certainly was there at the time,

1092
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,400
 and there was a post-mortem that was done on a man

1093
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,400
 who'd been shot, and there was a silk handkerchief

1094
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,400
 in his breast pocket, and they realised

1095
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,400
 that the silk handkerchief had

1096
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,400
 significantly helped for the bullet

1097
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,400
 to penetrate less. It was like, wow, that dented

1098
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,400
 the force of which it went. So he thought,

1099
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,400
 "What if we dressed

1100
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,400
 in lots of handkerchiefs, then

1101
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,400
 we would never die?" So he invented

1102
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,400
 what was... This is such a chaotic...

1103
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,400
 premature bulletproof vest,

1104
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,400
 whereby you wore 30 layers

1105
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,400
 of handkerchiefs on your body.

1106
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,400
 Yeah, and I think

1107
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,400
 it worked. I think people were shocked.

1108
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,400
 He did, until he got a really heavy cold,

1109
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,400
 and he just had to keep pulling around.

1110
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,400
 He became less and less safe.

1111
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,400
 Did people actually wear it?

1112
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,400
 Or was it just him trying to market his product?

1113
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,400
 It was him just experimenting with the idea

1114
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,400
 of bulletproof vests didn't need

1115
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,400
 to be metal plating, which is what everyone

1116
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,400
 was using at this point. The problem is

1117
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,400
 30 handkerchief vests weighed

1118
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,400
 much more than a metal plating, so...

1119
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,400
 But it is... It is white.

1120
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,400
 No Morris Dancer has ever been shot.

1121
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,400
 Because they've got the skills to move the handkerchief

1122
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,400
 into position at the right time.

1123
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,400
 So, handkerchief.

1124
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,400
 Yeah. The word "hanky-panky".

1125
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,400
 Oh, OK.

1126
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,400
 Does it come... Is it related to handkerchiefs?

1127
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,400
 It has nothing to do

1128
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,400
 with handkerchiefs.

1129
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,400
 It's not short for handkerchief-pankerchief.

1130
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,400
 LAUGHTER

1131
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,400
 No, it's not.

1132
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,400
 Can it be now?

1133
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,400
 Yeah. I just

1134
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,400
 imagined Andy going back home to his wife.

1135
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,400
 Little bit of handkerchief-pankerchief.

1136
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,400
 LAUGHTER

1137
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:04,400
 I'm only wearing 27 layers

1138
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,400
 of handkerchiefs tonight, darling.

1139
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,400
 Oh...

1140
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,400
 Is there a factor in that?

1141
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,400
 Not really, guys.

1142
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,400
 It's that handkerchief-panky

1143
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,400
 has nothing to do with sex.

1144
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,400
 It's completely originally meant juggling

1145
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,400
 or trickery.

1146
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,400
 But still nothing to do with handkerchiefs

1147
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,400
 because you would think...

1148
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,400
 It's maybe related to hocus-pocus.

1149
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,400
 Right. Hocus-pocus, hanky-panky.

1150
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,400
 That's a very sleazy magician, sorry.

1151
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,400
 Hocus-pocus, hanky-panky.

1152
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,400
 LAUGHTER

1153
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,400
 Have you guys heard of the

1154
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,400
 Valsalva effect?

1155
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,400
 No. The Valsalva effect

1156
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,400
 is something that we've probably all done.

1157
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,400
 We must have all done this, which is

1158
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,400
 when your ears are blocked

1159
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,400
 or you're on a plane and you get descending,

1160
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,400
 there's action of holding your nose

1161
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,400
 and holding your mouth

1162
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,400
 and blowing to get your ears popping.

1163
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,400
 That's what you do to equalize as well, isn't it?

1164
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,400
 Yeah. So it's the opposite of blowing your nose.

1165
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,400
 You're sucking in...

1166
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,400
 You're using the pressure that's shooting inwards.

1167
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,400
 So that's used for a number of things.

1168
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,400
 It's for relieving your ears.

1169
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,400
 It's for people with abnormal heart rhythms.

1170
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,400
 They use it to relieve chest pain.

1171
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,400
 They say if you do have

1172
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,400
 abnormal heart problems that you should always

1173
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,400
 consult a doctor before doing that,

1174
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,400
 just to make sure that you don't

1175
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,400
 make the situation worse.

1176
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,400
 But another thing that it's used for

1177
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,400
 is for people who suffer from premature ejaculation.

1178
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,400
 Oh, really?

1179
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,400
 Because I have very bad sinuses

1180
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,400
 and have...

1181
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,400
 ..and literally do that

1182
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,400
 Valsalva effect, I would say about

1183
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,400
 20 times a day.

1184
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,400
 Right.

1185
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,400
 I don't want to know what person or link you're making

1186
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,400
 to what bit of get-first is coming.

1187
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,400
 I want to know what's coming.

1188
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,400
 Not you.

1189
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:52,400
 You manage it.

1190
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,400
 Yeah, so pretty exciting, isn't it?

1191
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,400
 So you're supposed to do that mid-to-sex?

1192
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,400
 I think... I couldn't see where they said

1193
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,400
 if it was before or during,

1194
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,400
 but I imagine it's during, and I'm not sure

1195
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,400
 how you can disguise that as a sexy thing.

1196
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,400
 So next time you're having handkerchief,

1197
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,400
 handkerchief at home maybe.

1198
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,400
 Try it out and let us know

1199
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,400
 if it's before or during that it's required.

1200
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,400
 They are sexy things, though, aren't they?

1201
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,400
 Handkerchiefs. They were used

1202
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,400
 for sexy purposes back in the day.

1203
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,400
 In the 19th century, there were another one of these things

1204
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,400
 where there was a whole language behind handkerchiefs

1205
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,400
 that lovers could use to convey

1206
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,400
 messages to each other.

1207
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,400
 And there's actually a book, because we've talked before,

1208
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,400
 I think about the language of flowers.

1209
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,400
 If you sent flowers in a certain arrangement,

1210
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,400
 it meant different things.

1211
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,400
 Fans, the language of fans.

1212
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,400
 If your fan is three-quarters open, it means I'd like a handjob

1213
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,400
 but not a blowjob or whatever.

1214
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,400
 As you see, the woman with the fan.

1215
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,400
 So actually, anyway...

1216
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,400
 You're an absolute menace

1217
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,400
 in the summer, aren't you, Anna?

1218
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,400
 LAUGHTER

1219
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:56,400
 Question one, if you just want to keep cool.

1220
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,400
 Being pounced on.

1221
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,400
 There's a book published in 1879

1222
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,400
 called "A Complete Guide

1223
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,400
 to Glertation, Containing Handkerchief,

1224
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,400
 a Glove, Fan and Paracel Flirtations

1225
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,400
 and a Complete Language

1226
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,400
 of Flowers". So we have to assume everyone

1227
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,400
 memorized this at the time, so they understood

1228
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,400
 what each other was saying.

1229
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,400
 But drawing a handkerchief across your forehead,

1230
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,400
 do you know what that means?

1231
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,400
 Sweaty. Yeah.

1232
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,400
 It either means you're sweating profusely

1233
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,400
 or it means we are being watched.

1234
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,400
 Oh.

1235
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,400
 Don't jump me.

1236
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,400
 Across the cheeks was "I Love You".

1237
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,400
 Face cheeks?

1238
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,400
 LAUGHTER

1239
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,400
 LAUGHTER

1240
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,400
 The face cheeks, yes.

1241
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,400
 It's worth knowing.

1242
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,400
 Yeah. It doesn't actually...

1243
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,400
 This is where the problems can come, if you don't know.

1244
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,400
 I didn't actually note down the arse cheeks one,

1245
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,400
 so you'll have to just decide for yourselves.

1246
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,400
 Through the hands, if someone, you're talking to someone,

1247
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,400
 they'll weave a handkerchief through their hands.

1248
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,400
 Oh, yeah. I hate you.

1249
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,400
 Oh! Really?

1250
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,400
 It's horrible.

1251
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,400
 There was another one later in the 1970s,

1252
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,400
 which was in the LGBTQ community.

1253
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,400
 And you might wear

1254
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,400
 different handkerchiefs or bandanas,

1255
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,400
 and the colour might tell you what your fetish was.

1256
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,400
 So if you're in a club with like-minded people,

1257
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,400
 it would tell them what you're thinking.

1258
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,400
 Also, cartoon characters tend to wear

1259
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,400
 hankies and bandanas around their necks

1260
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,400
 because necks are quite hard to draw.

1261
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,400
 Oh, really?

1262
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,400
 And so... Oh, no.

1263
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,400
 Fred Flintstone wears a light blue sort of

1264
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,400
 cloth around his neck.

1265
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,400
 Apparently, he's into fallatio.

1266
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,400
 LAUGHTER

1267
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,400
 I'll rattle through these.

1268
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,400
 Fred from Scooby-Doo,

1269
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,400
 red, fisting, and...

1270
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,400
 Oh!

1271
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,400
 Captain Pugwash,

1272
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,400
 light cream, rimming.

1273
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,400
 So...

1274
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,400
 It's just if they happen to be in a club,

1275
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,400
 then that's what we've got.

1276
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,400
 Wow.

1277
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,400
 OK, it's time for our final fact of the show,

1278
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,400
 and that is James.

1279
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,400
 OK, my fact this week is that in the 1960s,

1280
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,400
 owners of a theme park in Pennsylvania

1281
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,400
 had guards with plastic bats

1282
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,400
 in the Tunnel of Love ride

1283
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,400
 who were instructed to give an admonishing

1284
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,400
 thwack to any bear bums

1285
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,400
 that they saw.

1286
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,400
 LAUGHTER

1287
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,400
 Cover that with a handkerchief now!

1288
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,400
 LAUGHTER

1289
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,400
 So this is a true thing that happened.

1290
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,400
 In actual fact, it didn't just happen in Pennsylvania.

1291
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,400
 It happened in a few different places.

1292
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,400
 And when you're saying plastic bats,

1293
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,400
 I'm thinking of table tennis bats.

1294
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,400
 I'm not thinking of a plastic

1295
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,400
 winged mammal bat.

1296
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,400
 LAUGHTER

1297
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,400
 I have seen them. They are table tennis bats.

1298
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,400
 Nice. Some of them were actually almost in the shape

1299
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,400
 of a hand, you know, like one of those big, sort of foam hands.

1300
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,400
 Yeah.

1301
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,400
 It was plastic, and they would whack the bums like that.

1302
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,400
 Oh, wow. And it's cos they didn't want people

1303
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,400
 making out all worse in their Tunnels of Love.

1304
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,400
 No, handkerchief, handkerchief. No.

1305
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,400
 LAUGHTER

1306
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,400
 So this was an article.

1307
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,400
 Originally, I read this in Mental Floss,

1308
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,400
 and I followed it up and found an article

1309
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,400
 in the Pittsburgh City Paper.

1310
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,400
 And this is about a place called Kenneword Theme Park.

1311
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,400
 And there is a ride there called The Old Mill.

1312
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,400
 It was constructed in 1901.

1313
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,400
 It's the oldest roller coaster in the whole place.

1314
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,400
 And it's one of these, you know, like a log flume,

1315
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,400
 where you're going in the water,

1316
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,400
 but there's no up and down bits.

1317
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,400
 You're just kind of slowly going round in the water.

1318
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,400
 Yeah.

1319
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,400
 And there's like things to see on the side.

1320
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,400
 So there might be scary things.

1321
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,400
 There might be skeletons, or there might be sexy things,

1322
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,400
 or whatever.

1323
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,400
 Yeah. Yeah? Yeah.

1324
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,400
 Yeah, fair enough.

1325
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,400
 And then I found this YouTuber

1326
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,400
 called Defunctland,

1327
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,400
 and he's done a video on this,

1328
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,400
 and it's one of the best videos I've ever seen

1329
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,400
 in my entire life on YouTube.

1330
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,400
 It's all about this place.

1331
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,400
 And he found an article from 1934

1332
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,400
 saying that this Tunnel of Love

1333
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,400
 was a really good place for people to make out.

1334
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,400
 And he found other Tunnels of Love

1335
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,400
 where people were whacking birdbombs.

1336
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,400
 And he asked people,

1337
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,400
 "Have you or anyone you know

1338
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,400
 ever kissed

1339
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,400
 or had sex

1340
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,400
 on the Tunnel of Love

1341
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,400
 in Kennywood?"

1342
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,400
 And he tweeted saying that

1343
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,400
 "I have received the most explicit,

1344
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,400
 disgusting and shocking emails

1345
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,400
 I have ever read."

1346
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,400
 [laughter]

1347
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,400
 So this was really...

1348
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,400
 And there are newspaper articles from the 30s, 40s, 50s,

1349
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,400
 60s, even, all of them saying

1350
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,400
 this is the place to go and make out.

1351
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,400
 This is where kids make out.

1352
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,400
 This is so famous for that.

1353
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,400
 It's only six minutes long, the ride.

1354
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,400
 Four minutes more than I need, buddy.

1355
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,400
 [laughter]

1356
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,400
 Well, I've got a technique with a nose.

1357
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,400
 [laughter]

1358
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,400
 I wonder for how many people

1359
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,400
 who got slapped on the butt by the ping-pong paddle,

1360
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,400
 that turned into

1361
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,400
 a sort of exciting new fetish that they didn't realise.

1362
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,400
 I think there might have been a bit of that.

1363
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,400
 There must have been so many Christmases where

1364
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,400
 they were going, "Yeah, yeah, I've got some ping-pong paddles.

1365
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,400
 I don't know, I just want to get into the sport."

1366
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,400
 There's no reason.

1367
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,400
 Can I say something incredibly boring

1368
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,400
 about this theme park, Kennywood?

1369
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,400
 Yeah.

1370
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,400
 So it was a trolley park originally,

1371
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,400
 and a few weeks ago on the podcast we mentioned trams.

1372
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,400
 Yeah.

1373
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,400
 That episode hasn't gone out yet,

1374
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,400
 but we will have recently mentioned trams.

1375
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,400
 [laughter]

1376
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,400
 And what's a trolley park?

1377
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,400
 I'm so glad you asked, Dan.

1378
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,400
 It is a miniature adventure park,

1379
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,400
 or a park with rides,

1380
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,400
 that's put at the end of a trolley line.

1381
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,400
 So trolley is just an American word for a tram, basically.

1382
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,400
 And it was to encourage people

1383
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,400
 to use the trolley car network at weekends.

1384
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,400
 So you would normally use them to get to work,

1385
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,400
 but at the weekend they weren't being used,

1386
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,400
 so they put something to attract people.

1387
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,400
 Exactly.

1388
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,400
 And so, sorry, I just thought we were all having so much fun,

1389
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,400
 and I just wanted to talk about tram infrastructure.

1390
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,400
 [laughter]

1391
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,400
 No, it's a good pallet cleanser.

1392
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,400
 Any more on this?

1393
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,400
 Well, just one other ride that there was

1394
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,400
 at Kennywood in the early days,

1395
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,400
 which was, sorry, not a ride.

1396
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,400
 There was one thing, an attraction called the House of Mystery,

1397
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,400
 but no one knows what it was.

1398
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,400
 [laughter]

1399
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,400
 That's pretty good.

1400
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,400
 Did no one ever come out of it?

1401
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,400
 It's been lost to history, unfortunately.

1402
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,400
 And there was one thing called spring water,

1403
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,400
 which was just a water fountain,

1404
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,400
 the stream of water coming from a spring.

1405
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,400
 There was a tin cup you could use to get a drink,

1406
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,400
 but you could use the water,

1407
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,400
 so that you would just get an electric shock

1408
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,400
 every time you tried to have a drink.

1409
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,400
 That was entertainment.

1410
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,400
 These rides are tunnels of love,

1411
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,400
 which you don't really see much anymore.

1412
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,400
 In fact, I don't think I've ever seen one myself,

1413
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,400
 a fairground ride or a theme park or whatever.

1414
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,400
 There's a few, like, in the UK.

1415
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,400
 Yeah, yeah.

1416
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,400
 But they're basically the equivalent of rides

1417
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,400
 that we've all seen at parks where you essentially get on them

1418
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,400
 when you can't be asked a cue for one of the good rides again,

1419
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,400
 and so you just sit on this really slow, boring boat.

1420
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:44,400
 And so they were often haunted rides

1421
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,400
 that were converted to tunnels of love or vice versa, weren't they?

1422
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,400
 So I think this one, at Kennywood,

1423
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,400
 went on to become hard-headed Harold,

1424
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,400
 horrendously humorous, haunted hideaway.

1425
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,400
 That's right.

1426
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,400
 It sounds like a worse ride.

1427
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:00,400
 They also branded it as a Panama Canal.

1428
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,400
 So you would go down here,

1429
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,400
 and it was this few going along the Panama Canal.

1430
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,400
 That's great.

1431
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,400
 It is, but the Panama Canal is literally just a canal.

1432
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,400
 There's no fun stuff on either side.

1433
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:10,400
 No, you're right.

1434
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,400
 And then in the end,

1435
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,400
 it was rebranded as Garfield's Nightmare Ride.

1436
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,400
 All of these...

1437
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,400
 Cat. Yeah.

1438
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,400
 Or President James Garfield.

1439
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,400
 Who wastes everything through his anus

1440
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:25,400
 for the last three months of his life.

1441
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,400
 Weird ride.

1442
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,400
 But I want to ride.

1443
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,400
 This guy, Defunkland,

1444
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,400
 who did this amazing video,

1445
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:37,400
 he said that he thinks, after getting all these emails,

1446
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,400
 that there are at least two people

1447
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,400
 who were conceived on that ride.

1448
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,400
 Oh, great, really?

1449
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:46,400
 And Kennywood Theme Park now uses the slogan,

1450
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,400
 "Welcome to the family."

1451
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,400
 But that's just a coincidence.

1452
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,400
 That's okay.

1453
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,400
 The Tunnel of Love, really.

1454
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,400
 I've read something saying there used to be hundreds,

1455
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,400
 as in maybe 700 across the USA.

1456
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,400
 Yeah, the USA is big, but that has a lot of Tunnels of Love.

1457
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,400
 But it all sort of sadly came into an end

1458
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,400
 because of the sexual revolution.

1459
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,400
 Yeah, but that's the thing.

1460
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,400
 The humanity became liberalised.

1461
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,400
 So basically you could snog in public.

1462
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,400
 You didn't have to go into a tunnel.

1463
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,400
 And because they were such a shit ride,

1464
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,400
 that was really the only good thing about them.

1465
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:20,400
 Another strike against the sexual revolution.

1466
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,400
 Do you guys know what was the fastest way to travel

1467
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,400
 in the entire world in 1880?

1468
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:28,400
 I'm going to say Tunnel of Love.

1469
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,400
 That is a ridiculous thing to say.

1470
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:34,400
 I don't know if everything was slow at the time.

1471
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,400
 Maybe there was a point in 1880 where all trains broke.

1472
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,400
 All the horses in the lane.

1473
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,400
 All the horses died.

1474
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,400
 Was it?

1475
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,400
 I'm just kind of...

1476
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,400
 Because I know this sneaky man, what he does.

1477
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,400
 I start seeking.

1478
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,400
 Was it an underground train system

1479
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,400
 that was one of the first of its kind,

1480
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,400
 underground in Paris that led to the Louvre?

1481
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:57,400
 And so it was the Tunnel of Love.

1482
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,400
 The Louvre?

1483
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,400
 He's seeking. He's not the Riddler.

1484
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,400
 OK, I'm going to have a pun.

1485
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,400
 Fastest trains at the time.

1486
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:12,400
 In America, they were only about 30 or 40 miles an hour.

1487
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,400
 In the UK, I think we had up to about 60 or 70 miles an hour.

1488
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,400
 I'm talking about something that was going at 112 miles an hour.

1489
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,400
 And this was public transport.

1490
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,400
 It was something you could travel on.

1491
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,400
 Because if you jump off the Eiffel Tower or something...

1492
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,400
 I wouldn't say jumping off the Eiffel Tower is transport.

1493
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,400
 And in 1880, definitely not.

1494
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:34,400
 Another bad commute, darling.

1495
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,400
 OK, no, no, but I think...

1496
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,400
 So the Tunnel of Love is a kind of boat ride that you go on.

1497
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,400
 Is it something like a log flume?

1498
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,400
 It's exactly a log flume.

1499
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:47,400
 So I found an article in the Chicago Herald in 1886

1500
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,400
 that told of a group of loggers, right?

1501
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,400
 So they're at the top of a mountain,

1502
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:54,400
 and they created these flumes.

1503
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,400
 They were kind of metal flumes,

1504
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,400
 which they would send the logs down,

1505
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,400
 and they would all go down to the bottom,

1506
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,400
 and that's where they would process them.

1507
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,400
 You cut them at the top, you would send them down.

1508
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,400
 Really, really steep.

1509
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,400
 Now, at the end of the day,

1510
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,400
 all of these workers would get on one of these logs

1511
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,400
 and fly down.

1512
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,400
 OK, there was a quote, and they said,

1513
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,400
 "We all looked at our watches.

1514
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,400
 We had made 16 miles in eight minutes and 40 seconds."

1515
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,400
 So that is an average speed of 112 miles an hour.

1516
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,400
 But they did come down there.

1517
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,400
 It's so terrifying.

1518
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:30,400
 There was a journalist in 1875, I think,

1519
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:33,400
 who went to report on the Nevada log flumes,

1520
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,400
 and they looked so cool,

1521
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,400
 and there is video footage of the logs going down them,

1522
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:41,400
 and they were built really high on scaffolding into the air,

1523
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,400
 like 70 feet in the air,

1524
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:46,400
 and they were these channels, which they zoomed down.

1525
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,400
 And yeah, this journalist said,

1526
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,400
 "Does anyone ever go down it?"

1527
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,400
 And they said, "Yeah, yeah, you can totally do that."

1528
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,400
 Now, I still don't know if the log was on this one,

1529
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,400
 actually did go down it, or they were pranking the journalist,

1530
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,400
 because the journalist said, "OK, I will."

1531
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,400
 The two owners of the log flume said,

1532
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:03,400
 "All right, well, if you're doing it, I guess we'll do it."

1533
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:06,400
 And none of the loggers agreed to get in with them.

1534
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,400
 And as they pushed him off, one of the loggers shouted,

1535
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,400
 "A flume has no element of safety.

1536
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,400
 You cannot stop. You cannot lessen your speed.

1537
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,400
 You have only to sit still, shut your eyes,

1538
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,400
 say your prayers, and wait for eternity. Bye!"

1539
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:21,400
 Smile for the camera.

1540
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:26,400
 And that's what their log flume rides are based on, those, right?

1541
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,400
 Right, yeah, yeah.

1542
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,400
 I think they've all shut down other log flumes,

1543
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,400
 but I think there was one operating relatively recently

1544
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,400
 in Washington, in the state of Washington,

1545
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:38,400
 which took an hour to go along, so it might have been a bit slower.

1546
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,400
 Yeah, yeah, they weren't all really steep,

1547
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,400
 just the ones on mountains were.

1548
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,400
 Lassie went on that one.

1549
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,400
 She did an episode of Lassie where Lassie went on a log flume.

1550
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,400
 OK, great.

1551
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,400
 Nice. Good.

1552
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,400
 She deserves a break.

1553
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,400
 Is Lassie a she? Yeah.

1554
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,400
 I didn't know that. Lassie.

1555
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,400
 Oh, Lassie.

1556
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:04,400
 It's in the name. It is in the name.

1557
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,400
 Jane Austen could have gone on a log flume.

1558
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,400
 That's the exciting...

1559
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,400
 It's one of my main interests is whether Jane Austen

1560
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,400
 could have done any of the tech we talk about.

1561
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,400
 So she was alive when...

1562
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,400
 But not the ride, the log flume, the actual log flume thing.

1563
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,400
 A tunneled boat ride.

1564
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:22,400
 This was a ride, actually. It was in France in 1817,

1565
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,400
 which is the year Austen died,

1566
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,400
 so she wouldn't have had a great time on it.

1567
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,400
 What a way to go.

1568
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,400
 What a way to go.

1569
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,400
 She died of something completely sort of ordinary and sad,

1570
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,400
 but if she died on a log flume,

1571
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,400
 it would have been perfect.

1572
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,400
 It was called the Soet du Niagara Falls,

1573
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:42,400
 and it was a boat which fell down a slope into a basin of water.

1574
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,400
 I mean, it's pretty much a classic log flume.

1575
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,400
 Anyway, Jane Austen could have...

1576
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,400
 I have a Red Mansfield Park. Is that about a theme park?

1577
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,400
 LAUGHTER

1578
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,400
 I can't believe you thought of Mansfield Park.

1579
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,400
 I was going through sense and sensibility.

1580
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,400
 No, that doesn't work.

1581
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,400
 Have you guys heard of...

1582
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,400
 There's a sex theme park in South Korea called Bloodland.

1583
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,400
 Have you seen it? No.

1584
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:05,400
 It's amazing. We say it's a theme park.

1585
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,400
 It's kind of like a sculpture park,

1586
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:10,400
 and it's just lots of penises and lots of people in positions of sex.

1587
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,400
 So it's not... You can't ride them, as it were.

1588
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,400
 There.

1589
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,400
 No, I don't think so.

1590
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,400
 Yeah, you can... Well, they do say there's a few hands-on exhibits,

1591
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:22,400
 such as the masturbation cycle,

1592
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:24,400
 which is you basically spin a thing

1593
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:28,400
 and you move their hands for them as part of this little exhibit.

1594
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,400
 It's a statue kind of thing. Right.

1595
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,400
 And then there's this really weird thing,

1596
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,400
 and I couldn't find anything more about it.

1597
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,400
 I searched quite a bit. It's this giant...

1598
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:40,400
 It's like a five-foot tall see-through penis

1599
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,400
 with sort of like computer workings all inside of it,

1600
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,400
 and it's just got a little plaque next to it,

1601
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:48,400
 and it's got a lot of words in Korean, which obviously I can't read.

1602
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,400
 But then there's only one English word on it, as far as I could see,

1603
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,400
 and the word is "terminator."

1604
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,400
 And that's...

1605
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:58,400
 I don't know if they're saying that's his particular penis,

1606
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:04,400
 or if it's a penis of the future coming back to our time to...

1607
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:07,400
 Would he have donated his penis? I haven't seen "terminator."

1608
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,400
 Is that the sort of thing that the character would do?

1609
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:12,400
 Yeah, I'll be back until I'm back. How's this?

1610
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,400
 Yeah, that's on Jeju Island, isn't it?

1611
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,400
 Yeah.

1612
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:21,400
 Originally, Jeju Island was like a honeymoon destination,

1613
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:24,400
 but it was... After the Korean War, there was a lot of arranged marriages,

1614
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:28,400
 so a lot of the couples had never seen each other or really met each other before,

1615
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,400
 and so they would go to this honeymoon destination,

1616
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,400
 and they were really inexperienced.

1617
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,400
 They didn't really know what to do,

1618
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:38,400
 and so they had... All the hotels had professional icebreakers

1619
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,400
 who would kind of sit next to you.

1620
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:43,400
 If you're having dinner at a restaurant and you're being a bit awkward,

1621
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:46,400
 - you're going to get a sensation again. - God, that's a great idea.

1622
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:54,400
 Sorry, you would be the worst human on earth as an icebreaker.

1623
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,400
 Did you know there was a trolley system on there?

1624
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:01,400
 Where are you going? Come back.

1625
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:04,400
 I'm saying I need one, not that I could be one.

1626
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:08,400
 I don't want to talk about traps any more than you do.

1627
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,400
 It's all I can think of.

1628
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:14,400
 Wow. This really is a cry for help.

1629
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:18,400
 OK, that is it. That is all of our facts.

1630
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,400
