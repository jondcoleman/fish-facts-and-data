00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:17,100
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,820
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

4
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,900
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covern Garden.

5
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,020
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

6
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:26,060
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

7
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,380
 Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin.

8
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,820
 And once again, we have gathered round the microphones

9
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,540
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

10
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,820
 and in no particular order, here we go.

11
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,260
 Starting with fact number one, that is James.

12
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,500
 - Okay, my fact this week is that in 1910,

13
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,340
 the World Health Organization tried to ban kissing.

14
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,180
 - Wow.

15
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,380
 You think that'd be a bigger story

16
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:51,980
 given such a huge organization, right?

17
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,700
 - Especially as it happened 30 years before they existed.

18
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:55,540
 - Yes.

19
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:56,380
 - You would think so.

20
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,220
 Thank you.

21
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,300
 - What's going on here?

22
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,700
 - If you listen very carefully,

23
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,620
 you will have heard me say the world's health organization

24
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,460
 as opposed to the more commonly known

25
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,500
 world health organization.

26
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,900
 And this was an organization.

27
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,060
 And when I say an organization,

28
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:16,060
 I mean really one woman in America called Imogene Recton.

29
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:20,060
 And she decided that everyone should stop kissing.

30
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:23,180
 And she got all the newspapers and invented a load

31
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,860
 of badges and pledges and stuff like that.

32
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,500
 And really thought that if people stopped kissing,

33
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,540
 then maybe we could stop the spread of disease,

34
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,220
 things like consumption, typhus, all that kind of stuff.

35
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,060
 - Yeah.

36
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,100
 - She kind of, she kind of been completely wrong.

37
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:36,940
 - Yeah.

38
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,100
 - If everyone stopped kissing everyone else,

39
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,140
 we'd have fewer diseases.

40
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:41,980
 - Yeah.

41
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,460
 - Well, we did try it for half a year in 2020,

42
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,300
 if you remember.

43
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,260
 - And no one got a cold.

44
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,740
 So, you know, I'm just saying maybe the cost

45
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,580
 is greater than the benefit.

46
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,700
 - Yeah, but I feel like she was almost ahead of her time

47
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,780
 understanding then about exchange of possible germs.

48
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,900
 I mean, our mouths are rank.

49
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,620
 We've got like billions of bacteria in them.

50
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,740
 I know a lot of them are probably good bacteria.

51
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,100
 But I think there was a study done that had people drink

52
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,180
 like a yakult or a probiotic drink

53
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,100
 and then had them snog their partner.

54
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:12,220
 And they found the 80 million bacteria transferred

55
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,100
 from one face to the other.

56
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,420
 - Bacteria is tiny though.

57
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,420
 Yeah, 80 million.

58
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,260
 - 80 million.

59
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,700
 - We don't know how much that is, do we?

60
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,740
 - Is there everything where it's like,

61
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:24,300
 oh, three bacteria transferred, it's gonna be big, right?

62
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,140
 - It's such a good point.

63
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,740
 - Even if three bacteria transferred before long,

64
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,580
 there's gonna be more than,

65
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,700
 there's gonna be four, five, six.

66
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,020
 - There you go, that's true, there you go.

67
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:31,860
 - They are rampant.

68
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,820
 - She does sound amazing.

69
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,660
 - Yeah.

70
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,500
 - Imogene as well.

71
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,500
 - Imogene.

72
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,260
 - Weirdly, some newspapers call her Imogene,

73
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,660
 but I think they might be misprints.

74
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,100
 'Cause most of them say Imogene.

75
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,980
 - She got a lot of support.

76
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:44,820
 She got some support.

77
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:45,780
 She got a thousand acolytes,

78
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,340
 which I think is a good hit rate

79
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,340
 for this slightly dramatic campaign.

80
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,380
 - She's got a number of acolytes.

81
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,220
 - Yeah.

82
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,500
 Well, including 70 brides

83
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,620
 who declined to be kissed at their own weddings.

84
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,700
 - Which I think, yeah.

85
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,540
 - Yeah.

86
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,460
 - You may now kiss a bride.

87
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,340
 No, you may not.

88
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,620
 - Yeah.

89
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,980
 - So in the article that you sent over, James,

90
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,820
 when you found this,

91
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,620
 there was a nice little thing that she,

92
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,220
 it starts off by saying that she'd convinced her husband

93
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,060
 of the risks associated with promiscuous kissing,

94
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,900
 which sounds like she had a bit of a dog in the race

95
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,740
 to begin with.

96
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,180
 Yeah, she had a husband.

97
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,820
 - So he was a big kisser, right?

98
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,860
 - Well, I think what it sounds like,

99
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,300
 reading further into the article,

100
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,100
 is that kissing on the lips and kissing generally

101
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,740
 was much more what you just did.

102
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,980
 If you had parties at the house,

103
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,260
 everyone would kiss each other on the lips.

104
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,100
 Women would kiss each other,

105
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,060
 men would kiss men.

106
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:30,900
 - 1910.

107
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,740
 - That's my party.

108
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,340
 - That's what her husband was telling her anyway.

109
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,780
 First of all, the keys go in the bowl,

110
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,900
 then we start kissing,

111
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,500
 and then we'll see what happens.

112
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,500
 - Yeah, I don't think men were snogging each other that much.

113
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,940
 By 1910, there've been phases when the kiss has been in,

114
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,780
 but I think her husband's been just spinning out yarn.

115
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,940
 - I did just throw that in.

116
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:46,780
 I have to admit,

117
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,500
 it was definitely said women were kissing women.

118
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,540
 I thought, well, men should be kissing men.

119
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,500
 - I was in France recently.

120
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,060
 I saw, I was in the South of France,

121
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,540
 and I was in a particularly kissy region.

122
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,380
 - Oh yeah.

123
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,200
 - It was a very kissy region.

124
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,140
 I think I saw some people kissing four times.

125
00:03:59,140 --> 00:03:59,980
 - Yeah.

126
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:00,820
 - But there's more.

127
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,660
 - Way more.

128
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,500
 - I think you do get, there are fives definitely.

129
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,340
 - I've had a good five or six.

130
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,660
 - I've had a good five or six.

131
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,500
 - You've had a six kiss.

132
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,140
 - Yeah, I lived in France for three months

133
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,580
 with my grandmother in 2003.

134
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,460
 I've had a six.

135
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,300
 You start counting when it.

136
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,140
 - Six.

137
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,300
 - Six, I've had a six.

138
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,380
 Maybe she wanted to give me six.

139
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,220
 - I've seen a five.

140
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,060
 - Your grandmother.

141
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:17,900
 (laughing)

142
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,980
 - No, her oldie mates.

143
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,900
 - All the grandmas at the retirement.

144
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,780
 Maybe they forget.

145
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,780
 Maybe they forgot.

146
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,740
 (laughing)

147
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,180
 Halfway through, they're like, ah.

148
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,020
 - What am I on?

149
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:27,860
 - I'm gonna start again.

150
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,700
 - You can be stuck in the old people's name for hours,

151
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,540
 go on you.

152
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,940
 - Think about older people kissing.

153
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,260
 This was actually one of Imogene's theories.

154
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,540
 And she thought that if she could stop older people

155
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,980
 from kissing each other,

156
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,780
 and actually more like stopping them from kissing children,

157
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,820
 then eventually when the older generation died out,

158
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,780
 so kissing would die out.

159
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,660
 'Cause the children wouldn't have got it

160
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,940
 into their system that it's a thing that you do.

161
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,780
 That was her plan.

162
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,620
 - That's interesting.

163
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,820
 Probably would have worked if she'd, again, if.

164
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,420
 - If she's got more than a thousand acolytes.

165
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,260
 - Yeah.

166
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,100
 - Yeah.

167
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:58,940
 - Yeah.

168
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,700
 - Look at this cultural thing, you know, it's a learned thing.

169
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,700
 - We assume it is.

170
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,860
 Yeah, I think there's some debate, isn't there?

171
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,380
 But I think we assume it's a learned thing largely

172
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:08,780
 because about just over half of societies don't do it.

173
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,740
 - Yeah.

174
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:13,500
 So the number is 46% do do it of cultures

175
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,140
 that were looked at to see whether lip to lip kissing

176
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:16,980
 was a thing.

177
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:17,900
 - But what's a culture?

178
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,940
 - As in is Britain one culture?

179
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,180
 - No, no, no, it's not like Britain.

180
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,060
 It's obviously tiny minorities of people

181
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,420
 'cause the vast majority of people on earth do kiss now

182
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,100
 because we're a globalized society.

183
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,140
 But if you go to an Amazonian tribe

184
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,380
 or Papua New Guinea or something.

185
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,220
 - Yeah, right.

186
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,060
 - I think it's particularly uncommon

187
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,460
 in parts of China, parts of Mongolia.

188
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,380
 That area is quite uncommon.

189
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,140
 - So it was 168 cultures from around the world.

190
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,940
 This was a professor of anthropology

191
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,420
 at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas,

192
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,540
 which I assume is a serious university.

193
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,340
 - I just associated it with gambling.

194
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,180
 I don't know why.

195
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,420
 - Las Vegas, it does do all the stuff.

196
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,860
 - That university is a very wealthy one actually

197
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,060
 'cause one year, a few decades ago,

198
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,380
 they put everything on red.

199
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,780
 And yeah, I could use it out now.

200
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,620
 - The first person who kind of observed

201
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,140
 that a lot of these cultures don't do mouth to mouth kissing

202
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:07,420
 was a guy called Paul Denjoy.

203
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:10,380
 So it's de-apostrophe and then enjoy.

204
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,220
 - Don't enjoy.

205
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,060
 - Don't enjoy.

206
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,020
 - It's such a good name.

207
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,420
 He said that some people considered it an abomination

208
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,380
 and a form of cannibalism.

209
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,220
 - Oh, come on.

210
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,980
 That's someone kissing too hard.

211
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,540
 - It's a step on the road,

212
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,860
 it's a step on the road to cannibalism.

213
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,700
 It's a slippery slope.

214
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,860
 - So just back to Imogen very quickly.

215
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,020
 I read a lot of newspaper articles about her

216
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,340
 because in 1910 and 1911, she was everywhere.

217
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,180
 Obviously, the newspapers saw this story

218
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,620
 that they're trying to ban kissing and they loved it.

219
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:40,380
 She was known as the foe of oculation in the press.

220
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,900
 Oculation being another word for kissing.

221
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,180
 And in August of 1910,

222
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,100
 she tried to organize a no kiss August,

223
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,180
 which you know, it's like, no drink January

224
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,380
 or whatever they call it in November.

225
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,900
 I reckon this might be the first of those.

226
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,340
 In 1910, it must be early.

227
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,100
 But then by 1912, there were no more mentions

228
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,900
 of her on newspapers.com.

229
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,140
 So after two years, the press weren't interested anymore.

230
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,540
 - Do we know any more about her story at all?

231
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,740
 Like, do we know when she died or?

232
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,660
 - I know when someone with her name died.

233
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,260
 Well, I couldn't tell if it was definitely her.

234
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,260
 So, I'm not really sure.

235
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,900
 She kind of went away after that.

236
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,540
 - Two hemorrhageans.

237
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,300
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

238
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:24,180
 - 13% of people, so they've been accidentally

239
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,700
 kissed on the mouth at work.

240
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,860
 - How does that?

241
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,580
 - Dan says, "Oh, yeah."

242
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,020
 Dan gets around kissing people on the mouth all the time.

243
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,060
 - Sometimes the turn comes too sharply.

244
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,620
 - An air kiss, to another air kiss.

245
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,340
 - Especially when you're doing seven.

246
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:42,220
 - I found someone else who has an anti-kissing rule.

247
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,620
 - Oh, yeah? - Oh, yeah.

248
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,460
 - And it's Champion Whistlers.

249
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,420
 Specifically one Champion Whistler,

250
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,300
 who's a guy called Christopher Ullman,

251
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,060
 who I think has won at the International Whistlers Convention.

252
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,100
 And there are lots of different kinds of whistling.

253
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,020
 And he says he has a no-kissing rule

254
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,900
 for 24 hours before a performance.

255
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,740
 - Interesting.

256
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,820
 - Well, he must have a lot of whistling groupies.

257
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,060
 - Yeah, he sounds great.

258
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,500
 He says it makes your lips mushy kissing before a performance.

259
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,100
 So he doesn't lick his lips,

260
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,340
 which I'm very impressed by.

261
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,340
 - God, that's amazing.

262
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,260
 Now, they must be dry, parched, and dry

263
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,180
 by the time he's whistling.

264
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:19,300
 - But then they must be like a solid whistle, right?

265
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,140
 - Have you got dry lips?

266
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,620
 I think it's very hard to whistle, isn't it?

267
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,620
 - Is it?

268
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,380
 What does he say, Andy?

269
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,980
 - I don't actually know how he moises them.

270
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,420
 I've only got other details,

271
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:32,020
 like he can do Mozart's oboe concerto, the oboe part,

272
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,020
 but whistling, which is hard.

273
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,500
 - I think most people can do any part, right?

274
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,700
 - Yeah, most people can whistle any tune.

275
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,220
 - If it's a tune, it's whistleable.

276
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,860
 - The problem is none of us knows Mozart's oboe concerto.

277
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,060
 - That piece, that's a good point.

278
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:43,900
 That's a very good point.

279
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,580
 - So when his stooge in the crowd goes,

280
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,140
 I bet no one here can do that.

281
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,340
 (all laughing)

282
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,580
 - And then he does it and everyone's like,

283
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,260
 is that that, is that that?

284
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,020
 - Better to do a plane engine though, or a drill,

285
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:59,540
 or, you know, something that doesn't sound like a whistle.

286
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,380
 - Yeah.

287
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,220
 - Exactly.

288
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,100
 - What would the point, what was that?

289
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:03,940
 - It was a drill.

290
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,180
 - That was Beethoven's.

291
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,140
 (all laughing)

292
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,580
 - All right, well, we're just currently driven

293
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,700
 by this guy's whole career.

294
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,940
 - No, but it's interesting because I, you know, how would you...

295
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,420
 - It can't be his career.

296
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,900
 (all laughing)

297
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,740
 - It's unclear.

298
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,580
 It's unclear.

299
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,420
 (all laughing)

300
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,700
 - I know he's got all these groupies,

301
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,420
 but really, you make it looking out for.

302
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,860
 - They asked him, in this interview,

303
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,500
 if his family gets sick of the whistling,

304
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,860
 and he said, "I actually don't whistle

305
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,980
 "around the house very much.

306
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,180
 "Random, idle whistling is very annoying."

307
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:32,540
 - Well, that's, someone's told him that a lot of times.

308
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,540
 In 1921, in the newspapers,

309
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,300
 there was a worry about people kissing freckled girls

310
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,100
 on the cheeks.

311
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,540
 Can you guess why that might be dangerous?

312
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,620
 This was in the newspapers.

313
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,100
 - Freckles come off, they go on your lips.

314
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,460
 You get a lip covered in freckles, can't eat you stuff.

315
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,060
 - Or would they thought to be contagious, I guess, is the...

316
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:52,900
 - Freckles?

317
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,700
 - Yeah, in the 1920s.

318
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,860
 (all laughing)

319
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,820
 - Was this a justified thing, or was it a great...

320
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,700
 Okay, so it's justified.

321
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,860
 Freckled girls.

322
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,740
 - Because, because, because they are out in the sun,

323
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,940
 so they are wearing what, back in the 1920s,

324
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,980
 was radioactive sunscreen.

325
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:08,820
 - You're so close.

326
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,020
 - Yeah, so the sunscreen had chemicals in it.

327
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,820
 - No, no, don't carry on with the wrong answer.

328
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,660
 - Okay, okay, just try...

329
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,420
 - Radioactive sunscreen, which meant that to kiss them

330
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,380
 would give radiation, and you'd become...

331
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,580
 - Yeah, have a radioactive part.

332
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,420
 - Oh, okay.

333
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,460
 - It's the being outside part.

334
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,300
 - No.

335
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,140
 - Poisonous makeup.

336
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,060
 - Almost.

337
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:27,020
 Basically, there was a antifreckle medication

338
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,820
 that people were using to try and get rid of their freckles,

339
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,020
 and it was toxic if ingested.

340
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,700
 And so there was a danger, according to the newspapers,

341
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,540
 if you kissed a freckled girl on the cheek,

342
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,780
 you might get sick.

343
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,260
 - Oh, my gosh.

344
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,900
 - That's awful, 'cause the girls are gonna think

345
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,340
 that their medication isn't working at all,

346
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,060
 'cause still no one's kissing them.

347
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,380
 - Yeah.

348
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,700
 - Alternatives to kissing,

349
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,980
 which people have had to come up with,

350
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,740
 these poor societies that don't have kissing.

351
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:53,780
 Darwin, who met a lot of people in his life,

352
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,780
 different peoples,

353
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,220
 listed a bunch of alternatives to kissing in cultures,

354
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:00,580
 and he listed rubbing of noses,

355
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:03,380
 like which lapplanders he's known as do,

356
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:06,140
 rubbing or patting of the arms, breasts, or stomachs,

357
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,740
 or one man striking his own face

358
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:11,220
 with the hands or feet of another.

359
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,660
 - Like a slap, proper slap.

360
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,980
 - It's like, why are you hitting yourself?

361
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:14,820
 Why are you hitting yourself?

362
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,100
 - Oh, right.

363
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,900
 - Well, actually, it's not you hitting yourself,

364
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,980
 it's me grabbing your hand

365
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,940
 and then hitting me in the face with your hand.

366
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,740
 - You are actually hitting yourself, yeah.

367
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,580
 - Why are you hitting me?

368
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,420
 Why are you hitting me?

369
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,260
 - Yeah, why are you hitting me?

370
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,100
 - Was that a game?

371
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:27,940
 Why are you hitting me?

372
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,780
 (laughing)

373
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:31,180
 - It was a cat phrase, you could say, yeah, yeah.

374
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,620
 - Can I talk about very quickly

375
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,140
 some other public health stuff?

376
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:34,980
 - Yeah.

377
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,060
 - Especially done by American women.

378
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:40,060
 So this is a group of middle-class women from Manhattan

379
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:43,460
 called the Ladies Health Protective Association.

380
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:47,020
 And they, basically, there was a huge pile of manure

381
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:50,380
 in the middle of New York, okay?

382
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:54,420
 They covered two blocks and stood 30 feet tall.

383
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,460
 - I was picturing much smaller when you said there was a pile.

384
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,300
 (laughing)

385
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,140
 - That's incredible.

386
00:11:59,140 --> 00:11:59,980
 - Like the Godzilla.

387
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,100
 - So what they would do is, obviously,

388
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,780
 a lot of horses in those days, right?

389
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,180
 They would collect the manure from stables

390
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,220
 and they would sell it as fertilizer to farmers

391
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,260
 who were just outside the city,

392
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,420
 but they needed someone to keep it

393
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,180
 and so they just kept it in the middle of the street.

394
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,860
 It was this guy called, weirdly enough,

395
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,540
 he was called Michael Caine.

396
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,260
 (laughing)

397
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,020
 But Caine, as in Harry Caine, with a K.

398
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:23,260
 But anyway, Michael Caine had this huge manure pile

399
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,180
 and he was making loads of money.

400
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,340
 He was making $300,000 a year,

401
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,580
 which today is about $8 million from this manure pile.

402
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,780
 And his brother-in-law was a New York state senator,

403
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,820
 so everyone thought there was nothing

404
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,380
 they could do about it.

405
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,780
 Anyway, this Ladies Health Protective Association

406
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,900
 came along and did a court case

407
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,020
 and amazingly, they won it.

408
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,660
 They basically called it a nuisance

409
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:46,420
 and by the law, there was no way that he could get around it

410
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,020
 because of this technical thing they called it.

411
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,820
 And not only that, the Board of Health denied any permits

412
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,500
 for any manure dumps in the whole city.

413
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,740
 So that's why, if you go to New York now,

414
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,940
 there's not a 30-foot pile.

415
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:01,180
 - I've always wondered why there's not a 30-foot pile.

416
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,900
 - And this group then turned to spitting.

417
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,740
 Sorry, they turned to stop spitting, okay.

418
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,660
 And that was when New York became the first city

419
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,540
 in the world that banned spitting.

420
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,540
 - Isn't it true that in the middle of the Central Park,

421
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:17,180
 there was a massive reservoir of spit?

422
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,980
 - Disgusting.

423
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,620
 - Okay, on with the podcast.

424
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,200
 (upbeat music)

425
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,700
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two

426
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,780
 and that is Andy.

427
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:33,140
 - My fact is that after King Charles I was decapitated,

428
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,660
 he was recapitated.

429
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,860
 - Oh, you just made that word up.

430
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,900
 - Yeah, so King Charles I,

431
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:43,180
 only King who's ever been executed,

432
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,980
 I guess loads of them have been killed in battles

433
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,180
 and things like that.

434
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:49,820
 But it was in 1649 and it was just after the English Civil War

435
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:53,540
 and obviously huge move, you know, big old move.

436
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,380
 - Big deal.

437
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,380
 - Political chaos, yeah.

438
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,380
 But the King's body basically had to be seen

439
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:00,980
 and the authorities, the sort of Republican authorities

440
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:04,260
 wanted to say, look, he's definitely dead

441
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,780
 and he's not coming back.

442
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:09,060
 So they employed a surgeon after the execution

443
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,060
 to stitch the head back on.

444
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,320
 - I would have thought that if I'd have seen

445
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,580
 his body without the head,

446
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,380
 that would be even more proof that he wasn't alive.

447
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,220
 - That's a good point.

448
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,380
 - It sort of looks like he was kind of coming back

449
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,140
 in the head that's meant to be off with suddenly back on.

450
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,940
 - Anyway, I should say quickly where I got this from,

451
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,140
 I've been reading a book.

452
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:25,980
 It's actually from a novel.

453
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,540
 It's called "Act of Oblivion"

454
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,500
 and it's all about the hunt for the regicides.

455
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,540
 - Is it by Thomas Harris?

456
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,740
 - No, by Robert Harris.

457
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,580
 - Robert Harris, yeah, yeah.

458
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,860
 - So basically, and it describes in incredibly gory detail

459
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,820
 the death of the King and also the death of the regicides

460
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,940
 who the people who signed the death warrant and all this

461
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,140
 and who really, they really put through the ringer.

462
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,220
 - Yeah, this is, we should say for internationalists,

463
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,260
 they didn't put them through the ringer

464
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,220
 as soon as they'd killed the King.

465
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,380
 It wasn't like you've executed the King

466
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,420
 and now we're gonna execute you.

467
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,940
 It was when the restoration happened.

468
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,300
 So there was a brief period

469
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,460
 where everyone was pro-killing the monarchy.

470
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:59,180
 And then sadly, yeah, after a decade, monarchy came back

471
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,940
 and then all the regicides got hunted down sadly.

472
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,020
 - Sadly, Aniseh, sadly monarchy came back.

473
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,500
 - From the perspective of a round head,

474
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,660
 I was adopting the character of Oliver Cromwell.

475
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,940
 - So I didn't know anything about Charles the First

476
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,100
 having not grown up in this country.

477
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,940
 So I am one of these foreign listeners, as it were,

478
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:15,780
 that you mentioned, Anna.

479
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:18,860
 And it struck me that what a big deal it was

480
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,220
 to kill the King off the back of a trial.

481
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,060
 'Cause there's all this stuff.

482
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,420
 And Oliver Cromwell is a name

483
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:26,140
 that is very much part of the decision

484
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,020
 to bring him to trial and have him execute.

485
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,860
 - A key player.

486
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,580
 - And the story gets quite gruesome

487
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,700
 when we talk about what happened to him and the others

488
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,020
 some 30 years later after the death.

489
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:37,860
 - Only 10 years later.

490
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:38,980
 - Sorry, 10 years later.

491
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,220
 - Okay, so 1649, Charles was killed.

492
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,140
 And then recapitated, right?

493
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:46,060
 1650, I think it was eight, Oliver Cromwell died

494
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,700
 after less than 10 years in office.

495
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,580
 And then two years later, the monarchy is restored, 1660.

496
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:55,540
 Then at that point, Oliver Cromwell is dug up

497
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,260
 and decapitated.

498
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:02,260
 So both Charles and Cromwell had a head-altering situation.

499
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,740
 - They should have switched the rounds.

500
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,260
 It was freaking Friday.

501
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,660
 - Freaking Friday.

502
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,060
 - It was his son, was it King Charles II,

503
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,660
 who was a direct son of Charles I,

504
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:15,220
 who then was the person in charge of the monarchy once?

505
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,620
 - The person in charge of the monarchy or the king?

506
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,460
 (all laughing)

507
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,860
 - Well, that's surprising that it disappeared for 11 years.

508
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,580
 I mean, that is a pretty big deal.

509
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,020
 It wasn't just overthrowing the monarchy,

510
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,380
 it was overthrowing all of the monarchy.

511
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,220
 - It was the other deal.

512
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,060
 - It was one of the biggest things

513
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,120
 that's ever happened in England's history.

514
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,860
 - I was just saying, as a foreigner,

515
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,700
 you don't follow, sorry, good up to date

516
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,700
 on Charles the first.

517
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,660
 - You have lived here for about 20 years now.

518
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,260
 I feel like you should have some point.

519
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,580
 - Yeah, it should have been as I was coming to immigration.

520
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,660
 - Did you not have to do an exam to get into the UK?

521
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,500
 - No, a British.

522
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,700
 - Well, do you want to know something really interesting?

523
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,020
 It's not in a lot of the citizenship tests,

524
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,460
 or at least a couple of years ago,

525
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,780
 there was a really good article on--

526
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,040
 - Maybe question number one.

527
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,300
 (laughing)

528
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,300
 - There was a really good article on history today

529
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:00,340
 about how it wasn't in the test for new immigrants.

530
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,740
 There was nothing about the civil war,

531
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,580
 anything like that, and missed that whole period.

532
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,620
 And someone asked immigration,

533
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,220
 why isn't this included?

534
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:11,020
 And they said the wounds are still too fresh.

535
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,060
 So I spoke first and said,

536
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,980
 the assumption is that we are all anti-cromwell.

537
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,260
 Obviously parliamentarian,

538
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,780
 didn't believe in the divine right of kings.

539
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,660
 The reason that Charles the first was overthrown

540
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,220
 was because he really went hard

541
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,260
 on the divine right of kings as well.

542
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,100
 He loved it, didn't he?

543
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,580
 Like he prorogued parliament for 11 years,

544
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,580
 didn't want to ask them anything,

545
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,340
 and then told them to give him loads of money.

546
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,100
 He was into absolutist monarchy.

547
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,300
 - And when they put him on trial,

548
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,740
 he was like, well, you can't put me on trial

549
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,540
 because God put me here, so.

550
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,380
 - Yeah.

551
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,700
 And now I think Cromwell is a bit of a villain

552
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,980
 to almost everyone.

553
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:42,060
 But in another country, he would be a hero.

554
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,420
 And in fact, in America, he's remembered quite heroically.

555
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,740
 - He's still got a statue outside of parliament.

556
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,220
 - Yeah, which is surprising.

557
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,700
 So he's not, yeah, and that wasn't toppled

558
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,980
 in the old topples of statues period

559
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,140
 that we went through quite recently.

560
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,740
 - No, it wouldn't be.

561
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,180
 - After he died, his, or rather after he died,

562
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:01,260
 was dug up and then posthumously re-executed.

563
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,900
 His body and a couple of comrades,

564
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,900
 they were hanged, beheaded,

565
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,820
 and then the heads were placed on spikes.

566
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,660
 His head stayed on a spike for 25 years.

567
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,020
 - That is the most amazing.

568
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,780
 For me, the most amazing thing about this whole thing.

569
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,620
 - It's a long time.

570
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,580
 - But for 25 years, whenever you came to London,

571
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,740
 you could go and look at a head on the spike.

572
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,460
 And if you came back 25 years later, it would still be there.

573
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,300
 - It's amazing.

574
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,140
 - It's amazing.

575
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,340
 Like, I think about all the shops near my house.

576
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,300
 Most of them are less than five years old

577
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,340
 'cause they just all got-

578
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,180
 - The turnover.

579
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,020
 - Yeah.

580
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:29,860
 - It was much less than those days.

581
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,580
 You got a lot of custom in the same place for a head.

582
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,420
 - Amazing.

583
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,740
 - But one person who lived through the whole thing

584
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,220
 was Oliver Cromwell's son, Richard.

585
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:40,660
 So when Cromwell died, he happened so often

586
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:44,740
 with rulers, tyrants, newly established raids.

587
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,580
 Anyway, they try and hand over to their kids.

588
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,020
 - So let's get rid of the monarchy.

589
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,740
 It's ridiculous that someone could have the divine right

590
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,980
 to rule, but when I die, I want my kids to have it.

591
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,220
 - I actually do think Napoleon too

592
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,460
 is a good name for an emperor.

593
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,140
 So, and anyway, so Richard Cromwell resigned.

594
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,740
 He was not up to the job.

595
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,220
 I mean, he was not, you know, as zealous as his father

596
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,540
 and he didn't have the authority.

597
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,860
 So he was kicked out in 1659, one year later,

598
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,380
 and he just lived out his life.

599
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,100
 He died in 1712.

600
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,380
 I think he moved overseas.

601
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,540
 - I think if your dad's head was on the spike

602
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,780
 in London, you probably would move out of town.

603
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,100
 - You wouldn't say in London, would you?

604
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,140
 - But get this, he died in 1712.

605
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,380
 He lived an incredibly long time.

606
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:27,100
 So he saw the whole thing and he was the longest-lived

607
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,940
 British head of state until the year 2012

608
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:34,440
 when he was overtaken by Queen Elizabeth the second prime.

609
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,420
 When she was 85.

610
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,980
 So that's the age he lived to.

611
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,700
 So for a long time, the longest-lived head of state

612
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,700
 was Richard Cromwell.

613
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,020
 - That's really funny.

614
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,580
 - Do you know where Oliver Cromwell's head is now?

615
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:46,500
 - Oh, was it reburied with the rest of him?

616
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,140
 - No, it was buried in Cambridge University now.

617
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:53,620
 - Okay, so I read this in a Giles Brandrith book

618
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,660
 and I tweeted him to ask him if this was true

619
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,620
 and he tweeted me back.

620
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,900
 So I said, "My memory of it goes like this.

621
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,540
 "There is a relic of Oliver Cromwell

622
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,780
 "kept by the chief whip or prime minister.

623
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,100
 "Have I made that up?"

624
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:04,940
 I probably have.

625
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:07,380
 He wrote back, "It's in the drawers at Checkers."

626
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,340
 So my memory is that the skull of--

627
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,780
 - The skull of Oliver Cromwell is in Checkers.

628
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:11,940
 - Is in a drawer.

629
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,780
 - In a drawer.

630
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:17,780
 - And I think I've read it in Brandrith's autobiography,

631
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,580
 his diaries of his time as a politician.

632
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,020
 And in it he says he goes to Checkers and the drawers open

633
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,340
 and they let you see and stroke the skull.

634
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,780
 - Stroke the skull.

635
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:30,260
 - So what I have in my notes is that one day

636
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,740
 there was a storm and the head blew off the spike

637
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,580
 and they thought, "You know what?

638
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,420
 "It's been here for 25 years.

639
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,180
 "We probably don't need to put it back up again.

640
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,380
 "Everyone's seen it now."

641
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,220
 - They get the idea.

642
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,060
 - Yeah, they get it again.

643
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:40,980
 - Exactly.

644
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,900
 - And then the skull was sort of taken away

645
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,500
 and it was just kind of sold in auction after auction

646
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,300
 and went through a load of families.

647
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,260
 But then it was buried at Sydney Sussex College,

648
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,900
 Cambridge in 1960.

649
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:53,740
 - Interesting.

650
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,580
 - That's what I've got.

651
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,500
 But I mean, probably like with these things,

652
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,740
 there's probably 20 of those skulls around there.

653
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,860
 - Yeah, and I don't specify what relic I mean.

654
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,540
 He could have thought it might have been a finger

655
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,380
 or something in my head.

656
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,220
 It's his head.

657
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,300
 - Oh well, maybe it's not the head.

658
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,980
 That's more normal if it's a finger.

659
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,260
 'Cause I can't think of a drawer that could even fit a skull.

660
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,860
 - Oh, I think you can't think of a drawer that could fit a skull.

661
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,700
 - I can't imagine.

662
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,540
 - Are you gonna pull out of that?

663
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,740
 - I should pull out of that.

664
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,580
 I suppose I'm imagining a desk drawer

665
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,900
 and there's old desks and tiny drawers.

666
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:20,780
 - The bottom drawer,

667
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,460
 universe standard wooden desk will be a bit bigger.

668
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,300
 - But even if that didn't exist,

669
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,020
 it doesn't take much imagination to take a drawer

670
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:28,980
 and make it slightly deeper.

671
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,820
 - My head, ironically, my head is not big enough

672
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,900
 to get around this concept.

673
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:38,300
 - Have you ever seen a filing cabinet because...

674
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,140
 - Oh, no, don't.

675
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:39,980
 It's too much.

676
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,820
 - You're gonna flip your lid.

677
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,020
 - I can't take it.

678
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,860
 So Anna's amazing Freaky Friday idea,

679
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,740
 which I actually think is a brilliant idea.

680
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,740
 - Thank you.

681
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,620
 - Maybe could have been truish

682
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,940
 because when Cromwell's head got put on the spike,

683
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:56,380
 there was a big rumour around that actually it wasn't his head

684
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,900
 and that they'd mistakenly got on the wrong one

685
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:02,260
 and it was probably some old King of England.

686
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,900
 They didn't specify which one it was.

687
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,180
 'Cause it was, he was originally buried.

688
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,500
 Was it in Westminster Abbey, I think?

689
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,500
 - Right, yeah.

690
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,500
 - So there was loads of other Kings there

691
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,460
 and they thought that they dug up the wrong thing

692
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,060
 and just put an old King's head there.

693
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,900
 - Surely you just pick the roundest head.

694
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,740
 - Brilliant.

695
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,580
 - Brilliant, yeah.

696
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,420
 - Round head joke.

697
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,260
 - It's a round head joke.

698
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,100
 - Oh, very nice.

699
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,140
 - They did used to toss them in all together a bit.

700
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,820
 Like actually there was obviously a conundrum

701
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,940
 after Charles was decapitated

702
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,740
 because they don't wanna create a martyr of him

703
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:30,100
 by having it either be a big thing bearing him

704
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,420
 or not bearing him at all.

705
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,100
 So I think they took him away to Windsor

706
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,660
 and they entered him in Henry VIII's tomb, weirdly.

707
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,500
 - Wow.

708
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:41,260
 - And then in 1813 they decided to dig him up again.

709
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,420
 I think this was to check.

710
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,260
 - Again, again.

711
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,100
 - He was there, again.

712
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,060
 - Right, okay.

713
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:45,900
 - Just the first time again.

714
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,940
 - Oh, okay, sorry, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

715
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,260
 - And it was George III's physician,

716
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:54,100
 Henry Halford, who was kind of leading the exhumation.

717
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,660
 And he ended up with Charles's vertebra

718
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:00,100
 and some beard and some of his teeth.

719
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:00,940
 - Beard.

720
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,380
 - Which is, yeah, some beard.

721
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:05,180
 - I'm surprised the beard is still extant

722
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,020
 after all that time.

723
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:06,860
 - Yeah.

724
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,700
 - Yeah, that seems weird, doesn't it?

725
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,540
 - From how many years?

726
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,380
 - How many years, did we say?

727
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,500
 - Yeah, well, this was 1813, so it's 100 years.

728
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,340
 - 160 years.

729
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,180
 - What?

730
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,180
 - So he says that they went,

731
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,700
 "Oh, it's not worth opening the coffin again.

732
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,420
 "Do you mind just keeping these?"

733
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,380
 And he kept them.

734
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,740
 Other people who were there say that he went in

735
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:24,540
 and nicked all the stuff and hung onto it.

736
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,460
 But then his grandson returned it.

737
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,100
 It was the 1890s and he went to the Prince of Wales

738
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,660
 and said, "Well, look, we've got these bits

739
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,460
 "of Charles I, do you want them?"

740
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,940
 - The story, the QI facts that we always say

741
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:38,620
 about this is that they used the vertebrae as a salt holder.

742
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,220
 - Oh, really?

743
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,940
 - Yeah, so if you ever went for dinner

744
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:45,220
 at Sir Henry Hulford's house and you wanted some salt,

745
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,380
 it would be a little dish,

746
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,540
 but when you looked at it closely,

747
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,140
 it would be part of his backbone.

748
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,340
 - Wow. - That's,

749
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,220
 and you can fit that in a cupboard.

750
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,740
 (all laughing)

751
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:57,100
 - The eventual outcomes for the regicides

752
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,260
 who were the people who'd signed the death warrant,

753
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,940
 basically, were bad.

754
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,620
 So I think a lot of them are disemboweled.

755
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,460
 - They're bad.

756
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,300
 - They were not good.

757
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,140
 - They were courted.

758
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,140
 - They were, yeah, hanged until not quite dead

759
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,940
 and then had the genitals removed

760
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,740
 and then were disemboweled.

761
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,580
 - Still alive, still conscious.

762
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,740
 - While still alive, got to the lie.

763
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:16,740
 But if you got away, then it could be okay.

764
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:20,620
 And interestingly, if you live in Connecticut near,

765
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,180
 I think in New Haven,

766
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:25,340
 then there are three streets called Dixwell Avenue,

767
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,460
 a Wally Avenue and Goff Street.

768
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,300
 - Dixwell.

769
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,300
 - Dixwell and Wally.

770
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,140
 - Wally.

771
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:30,980
 - And what was the other one?

772
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,300
 - Dixwell, Wally and Goff.

773
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,420
 (all laughing)

774
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:37,620
 - They were the worst surveyors that I ever had for life.

775
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,660
 - But Wally and Goff are the two

776
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,540
 that are in this book, Active Oblivion.

777
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,380
 - Are they?

778
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,940
 - Dixwell was the doubt, apparently.

779
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,300
 (all laughing)

780
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,820
 - Well, they all ended up in this place

781
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,420
 and they liked them so much in America,

782
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,260
 obviously, 'cause America aren't that pro monarchy,

783
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,620
 that they named these streets after them.

784
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:53,340
 - Yeah, they were in very, very religious,

785
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,540
 puritanical communities,

786
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,660
 which were already very uncertain about monarchy

787
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,500
 and wanted development.

788
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,940
 - It was kind of the place where they could go,

789
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,380
 wasn't it, when they were safe?

790
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,860
 There was another place in North America

791
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,900
 named after someone connected to this story.

792
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:08,020
 So the wife of Charles I was Henrietta Marie.

793
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:11,500
 She was a French Catholic princess.

794
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:15,820
 She got married by proxy, which is quite cool.

795
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:19,020
 So Charles I wasn't there when she got married.

796
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,220
 So he had a proxy who was George Villiers,

797
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,980
 the first Duke of Buckingham,

798
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,860
 but George Villiers wasn't available either.

799
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:28,260
 So they got another proxie, her name was Charles de Lorraine,

800
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,140
 who was the Duke of Chavres.

801
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,300
 And basically, they got married

802
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,300
 with this guy pretending to be the king.

803
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,740
 And in those days, you could do that.

804
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,940
 - I think we've said before, haven't we?

805
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:40,100
 There were various rituals, if you marry a proxie,

806
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,020
 like you, as the proxy would,

807
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,460
 maybe have to touch the person's thigh.

808
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,300
 I think that happened.

809
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,980
 - You have to lie in bed and touch the thigh.

810
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,820
 - Lie in bed and be witness with them.

811
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:49,660
 Yeah, yeah.

812
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:53,580
 - So the king only met his wife three months later at Dover.

813
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:56,540
 So they'd been married for three months when he met her.

814
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,380
 - That's so funny.

815
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:00,060
 - And one of these areas in North America

816
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,300
 where Catholics felt safe where they could go

817
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,820
 was named after Henrietta Marie,

818
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:09,820
 and it was Maryland, or Maryland, or Maryland.

819
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,500
 And we always say this name,

820
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,460
 and we always pronounce it wrong on this podcast,

821
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,860
 and the people of Maryland always write to us.

822
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,980
 But now I actually think that because it's named

823
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:21,380
 after Henrietta Marie, it should be called Marie-Land.

824
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,220
 - Yeah.

825
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,980
 - So that's why I will be covering it from now on.

826
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:24,820
 - Excellent, very nice.

827
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:27,460
 - Especially because she didn't like Mary, actually.

828
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,780
 'Cause she was French, and she was very French.

829
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,980
 And she was beginning English.

830
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,180
 She didn't like being called Mary.

831
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,460
 - So the English used to call her Mary as like a micknail.

832
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,940
 - And she said, no, I'm French.

833
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:36,780
 Mary's not my name.

834
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,500
 I don't even like the name Mary, fair enough.

835
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,020
 Mary is a better name than Mary, I-M-O.

836
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,860
 - Can we talk a bit about the execution itself?

837
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,460
 Why is it such an interesting,

838
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,100
 I mean, what an extraordinary,

839
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,900
 I mean, one of the weirdest days ever to happen

840
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,100
 in English history, you know?

841
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,500
 It was on whiteboard, it was not far from here.

842
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:57,780
 So when it happened, the executioner had to wear a disguise,

843
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,580
 because the executioner's never been identified for sure.

844
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,540
 - Do you not just mean like a hud?

845
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,380
 - No, I don't.

846
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:07,340
 I mean a wig, a fake beard, a sailor's costume.

847
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,420
 - Yeah, confusing details here.

848
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:11,780
 - I'm clear as to why, and fishnets over the face.

849
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,620
 - Okay.

850
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,460
 - So afterwards, after the restoration,

851
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:16,340
 there was a big manhunt for who was the exact executioner,

852
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,580
 'cause we're gonna kill him.

853
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,820
 - There must have been a lot of sailors

854
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:22,980
 getting rid of their fishnets just in case they can't.

855
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:25,900
 - Well, the executioner was never properly identified.

856
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,380
 One guy was sentenced to death for it,

857
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,740
 but then the sentence was overturned.

858
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,020
 - And one guy claimed to be,

859
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:33,260
 and then wrote that they can't remember about that.

860
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,100
 - There's a museum in London

861
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,660
 that has a few of these relics from the execution,

862
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,940
 including a shirt that belonged to Charles the First,

863
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:39,940
 that they believe.

864
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:42,120
 You know, they can't actually work out properly,

865
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,460
 but all his bits of clothing was sort of torn off him,

866
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,780
 and handed round and orchid.

867
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,860
 - That's the museum of London, isn't it?

868
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,060
 - The museum of London, yeah.

869
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,740
 And among those items, they have a patched leather shoe

870
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,220
 of a man called John Big,

871
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,060
 and they believe that Big was the executioner.

872
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,220
 At least that's one of the theories.

873
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,060
 - Okay, Mr. Big.

874
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:00,380
 - Mr. Big, yeah.

875
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:03,060
 - That's what that whole thing, it was an analogy.

876
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,740
 - The Sex and the City character, Mr. Big.

877
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,780
 - It was an analogy for the English Civil War.

878
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,660
 - Yeah, that's very interesting.

879
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,700
 - Can't believe you didn't see that.

880
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:12,820
 - So I guess, I guess, what's our name is it, Carrie?

881
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,660
 - Guess it.

882
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,980
 - Carrie Fishnet, Carrie Fishnet.

883
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,340
 But they thought that would be too obvious.

884
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,180
 - Oh my God.

885
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,780
 - I don't think it's Carrie Fishnet.

886
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,620
 - Is she called Carrie Bradshaw?

887
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,000
 - Oh, Carrie Fishnet is a different person, isn't it?

888
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,820
 - I think it's Carrie Bradshaw.

889
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:24,340
 - She called Carrie Bradshaw, well, interestingly,

890
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:27,380
 John Bradshaw was the parliamentary commissioner

891
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:30,140
 who tried Charles I in Westminster at all.

892
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:30,980
 - You are joking.

893
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:31,800
 - No.

894
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,420
 - I can't believe we're actually blowing this shit wide.

895
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,540
 (laughing)

896
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,380
 - This is huge.

897
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,220
 - Bradshaw and Big.

898
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,420
 - If any of us had ever properly watched Sex and the City,

899
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,260
 we'd be all over it right now.

900
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,840
 (upbeat music)

901
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:48,340
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

902
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:50,100
 and that is Anna.

903
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,540
 - My fact this week is that in World War II,

904
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:55,940
 a Finnish soldier got tired in the Arctic,

905
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,580
 so took the entire platoons,

906
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,540
 rations of methamphetamine,

907
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:03,180
 and subsequently skied 400 kilometers to safety.

908
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,180
 (laughing)

909
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,020
 - It's extraordinary.

910
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,060
 - It's the power of uppers.

911
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,540
 - It's insane the story.

912
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,460
 - It's a really insane story.

913
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:15,260
 So this is a chap called Aimo Koyvanen,

914
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:19,140
 and it was a time when Finland was all with the Soviet Union.

915
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,860
 It was mid-Second World War.

916
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,420
 Finland was sort of on Germany's side,

917
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:25,980
 all with the Soviet Union, and he's fighting

918
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:29,420
 in this very cold area with his platoon,

919
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,820
 and he had been tasked with keeping

920
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:36,100
 his entire group supply of pervitin, which is meth.

921
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,300
 And it was so crucial in the Second World War,

922
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,460
 everyone was bloody taking it,

923
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:42,180
 and he was really, really tired,

924
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,500
 and I think the Soviets were coming and chasing them,

925
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,900
 and he was told to lead them to make tracks

926
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,820
 and lead them away so they could escape.

927
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,860
 And he was at the front,

928
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:54,580
 and he said in his memory of it that,

929
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,940
 so plausible.

930
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,140
 (laughing)

931
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,540
 He said, especially 'cause first of all he said,

932
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,540
 I didn't wanna take them 'cause I was kind of against that,

933
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,580
 I disapproved of drugs, so I tried not to,

934
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,420
 but then I got so knackered that,

935
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,660
 look, I just tipped a pill into my hand,

936
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,860
 what I hoped was a pill, but I was wearing mittens,

937
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,820
 and so quite a few came out,

938
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:13,260
 turns out all 30 of the pills came out,

939
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,660
 and then because he wanted to hide

940
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,380
 what he was doing from his comrades,

941
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,660
 he just ate them all.

942
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,500
 (laughing)

943
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,140
 - You're being shot at, it's stressful.

944
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:24,660
 - I'm just, I'm just gonna have all the tic-tacs basically.

945
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,500
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

946
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,700
 - If you pour a lot of tic-tacs in your hands,

947
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,380
 let's say you only want two, but accidentally rive come out,

948
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,820
 you're not gonna put them back in the tic-tac.

949
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:32,660
 - Exactly.

950
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,980
 - Especially if you're being shot at.

951
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:34,820
 - You're being shot at.

952
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:37,500
 - As I usually am when I eat tic-tacs.

953
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,940
 - Just drop them in the snow, anything.

954
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:43,100
 - And then it goes Sonic the Hedgehog, 'cause suddenly,

955
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:43,940
 - I don't, I was thinking--

956
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:44,780
 - He just eats this.

957
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,980
 - I was thinking of Popeye when Popeye had just finished,

958
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,300
 (laughing)

959
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:54,300
 suddenly turned into a mutant absolute, like, yeah.

960
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:59,300
 He basically, as it goes, he received the hit in one swoop,

961
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:02,940
 and the hit, by the way, lasts for a very long time.

962
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,540
 - When you take a normal amount of meth,

963
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,620
 it can last a few days, so I think--

964
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:09,340
 - He took an OD level of it, is what they say right.

965
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:12,140
 And I figure that the OD level would come to you in one hit.

966
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:14,460
 This kind of just plays out over a number of days,

967
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,940
 and he goes speeding away, and they're trying to,

968
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,860
 they're trying to chase him, and they eventually--

969
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,100
 - He's collected all his rings.

970
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,020
 (laughing)

971
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:23,820
 - And they can't keep up, and the music goes really fast,

972
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:26,380
 and they're chasing him still, and he's just going off,

973
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:28,420
 and then this is the craziest bit,

974
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,260
 which presumably you've got more on, Anna,

975
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,420
 'cause I just couldn't believe it, so I stopped reading.

976
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,660
 He blacks out.

977
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,220
 (laughing)

978
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:38,340
 He blacks out, and keeps going.

979
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:41,500
 - Basically, a few days later, he kind of was like,

980
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,340
 "Oh, where am I?"

981
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,180
 - Yeah.

982
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,020
 - And it turned out they'd been doing that.

983
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:47,660
 (laughing)

984
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,700
 - He may have collapsed multiple times on the way.

985
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,300
 Basically, one of the things I found surprising

986
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,660
 in his account is that he said,

987
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,100
 "You felt amazing for a bit."

988
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,060
 Quite a short time, I think,

989
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,660
 where he'd speed like something, the hedgehog,

990
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:00,260
 and then he said, "Something very unexpected happened.

991
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,580
 "I completely lost the plot

992
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,380
 "and started hallucinating and collapsing.

993
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,540
 "I would say that's not unexpected

994
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:07,260
 "if you have taken 30 pills of Beth."

995
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,780
 But then, the mystery is what happened

996
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,500
 to the people with him, and I think,

997
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,100
 'cause what proceeded this was actually

998
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,300
 an argument between him and his men.

999
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,780
 And he blacks out, and the next thing he remembers,

1000
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:20,420
 he wakes up and he's completely on his own.

1001
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,700
 So, one sort of suspects, they had a chat

1002
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,900
 and said, "This guy's been so annoying right now.

1003
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,460
 "He's a massive liability."

1004
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,220
 - Post-meth, post-him-taking of the pills.

1005
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,060
 - Post-meth, yeah.

1006
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,260
 Well, they took all his ammunition off him, didn't they?

1007
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,300
 - Yeah, yeah.

1008
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:35,460
 And his food supplies, so he woke up and had nothing.

1009
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,540
 - Well, then he started skiing towards,

1010
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,460
 he saw some allies in the distance

1011
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,620
 and started skiing towards them,

1012
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,500
 much too late, realized he's their Russians.

1013
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,340
 - Yeah.

1014
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,860
 - But he's still got the drugs on him.

1015
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:48,300
 - He skis through them and past them, keeps going.

1016
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,540
 - He said they were so confused,

1017
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,260
 they just moved, they should have shot him,

1018
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,340
 and they just moved their legs out

1019
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,820
 the way to let him get past.

1020
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:56,060
 - Excuse me, he spent all night

1021
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,580
 trying to get to a distant farm window,

1022
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:59,500
 which turned out to be the North Star.

1023
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,100
 (laughing)

1024
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,900
 - And then, he survived, didn't he,

1025
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:07,700
 by chewing on some tree, like a cactus-style?

1026
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,780
 - He boiled pine needles at one point,

1027
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:14,700
 so he still had delicious pine tea, had some pine tea,

1028
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,220
 but he was really starving.

1029
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,620
 It was only at the very end

1030
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,180
 where he somehow had found a hut,

1031
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:22,060
 finally there's cabin in the woods,

1032
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,620
 and first of all, it's so funny.

1033
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,380
 He says, "I lit a fire in the middle of the cabin."

1034
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,420
 It's still clearly high, so didn't know

1035
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,460
 what he was doing, lit a fire in the middle

1036
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,980
 of a wooden cabin, and it just set fire to the cabin.

1037
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,660
 And he said, "I just sat next to the fire

1038
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:35,060
 "and followed it around as it burned the cabin down,

1039
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:37,700
 "gradually, the whole cabin collapsed around him."

1040
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,380
 - How many days into the trip,

1041
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,420
 and I mean the trip?

1042
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,820
 - Well, he just doesn't know.

1043
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,860
 I think about five days, but he has no idea.

1044
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,340
 He only realized when he came out of it,

1045
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,620
 it had been two weeks.

1046
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:50,820
 And yeah, on his last day, he was about to starve to death,

1047
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,780
 and a J flew past, and he whacked it with a ski pole,

1048
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,420
 and ate a raw J.

1049
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,900
 - Again, not the actions of someone

1050
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:58,740
 who's completely with it.

1051
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:02,340
 I mean, the ability to beat a bird out of the sky is unusual.

1052
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,660
 - It was a stick, that's hard though.

1053
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:04,500
 - It was a stick.

1054
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,780
 - Those ski poles are quite thin.

1055
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,140
 - People don't go on pheasant shoots

1056
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:08,980
 with just a ski pole, do they?

1057
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,020
 - No, they're pros, yeah, yeah.

1058
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,620
 Was this before or after he got blown up?

1059
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,460
 Sorry.

1060
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,300
 - That was after.

1061
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,420
 - Oh yeah, that's right.

1062
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,460
 - So he was sat on fire, and then he was blown up,

1063
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,700
 and then he had the J, right?

1064
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,860
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1065
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:23,860
 'Cause he found another little building,

1066
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:26,020
 and so it was a German post,

1067
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,860
 but the Germans had retreated from it,

1068
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:30,900
 and they had attached mines to it.

1069
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,540
 So he basically shredded his entire foot

1070
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,180
 in the first explosion,

1071
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,860
 and then he sort of hopped around,

1072
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:40,780
 and he opened a door, and then that was also mined,

1073
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:43,420
 and supposedly he came to about, you know,

1074
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,340
 many meters away, he'd been blasted across,

1075
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,100
 but he was still holding the door lock,

1076
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:47,940
 like in a cartoon.

1077
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,700
 (laughing)

1078
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,940
 - Yeah, it's the most extraordinary story.

1079
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:52,940
 - Do we think true?

1080
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,580
 - I can't imagine any of it's true,

1081
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:57,020
 I think he was sitting at home.

1082
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:59,140
 - Because we knew he was anti-drugs, right?

1083
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,580
 Maybe he's come up with all this

1084
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,140
 of his adult dude drug stuff.

1085
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:05,100
 - Oh, this is like a finished 40s talk to Frank thing.

1086
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,300
 - Yes.

1087
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,900
 - I think we know, 'cause we know from his associates

1088
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,940
 that the first bit happened and the last bit happened,

1089
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,220
 but I suppose the only account we have

1090
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:14,100
 of the in-between bit is his.

1091
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,940
 - With a guy with a lot of drugs in his body,

1092
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,100
 that's all we've got.

1093
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,980
 - But he must have had a shredded foot, right?

1094
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:19,820
 - Yeah, yeah, the blown off first.

1095
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:20,900
 - And he must have been holding a doorknob.

1096
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,620
 (laughing)

1097
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,020
 - Must have had a bloody ski pole with him.

1098
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,060
 - Oh, dead Jane.

1099
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,460
 - He just kind of looked at all these things,

1100
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:30,540
 like, right, I'm gonna have to make a story up about these.

1101
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,820
 - But anyway, somehow he made it,

1102
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:34,820
 I mean, eventually he was found by his allies,

1103
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,740
 who were the Germans or the Finnish,

1104
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:39,060
 and taken to hospital and--

1105
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:41,900
 - Apparently his heart rate was still 200 beats per minute

1106
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,380
 at that stage. - God, it's a lot.

1107
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,220
 - It's a lot.

1108
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,340
 - It's incredible he lived.

1109
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,420
 - It's extraordinary. - And then he drove

1110
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,460
 to the ripe old age, you know,

1111
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:50,260
 who just wore it in the '70s and then, yeah.

1112
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,540
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1113
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:54,460
 - Anyway, he was mad, but the use of meth was,

1114
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,540
 it was big, wasn't it?

1115
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,220
 The Germans were particularly into it.

1116
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,300
 - Yeah.

1117
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,460
 - But everyone did it.

1118
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,460
 - Well, I was reading you could get these pills

1119
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:04,020
 called Forced March, which were quite common,

1120
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,580
 even like at the start of the 20th century.

1121
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:09,900
 So they were a blend of cocaine and caffeine.

1122
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,260
 I mean, I don't know why you need a caffeine

1123
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,620
 at the point where you've had all the cocaine,

1124
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:16,540
 but it was basically, it was sold publicly,

1125
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,540
 it was sold by the Wellcome, actually,

1126
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:20,060
 or by Burrow's Wellcome, who was one of the Wellcome family.

1127
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:20,900
 - Oh, really?

1128
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,100
 - It was a pharmaceutical family there, yeah.

1129
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:23,940
 - Yeah, they took them to the,

1130
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:26,580
 on the Antarctic Expeditions, the Forced March.

1131
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,500
 - Yeah, cocaine, opium. - Yeah, Scott and Shackleton,

1132
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,980
 but they took specifically Forced March,

1133
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:33,100
 which I think they've got to market it in a gentle way,

1134
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,620
 or maybe that's what you want is Forced March.

1135
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,260
 - I think that's what you need in motivation, right?

1136
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,100
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

1137
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:37,940
 - I can't march anymore.

1138
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:38,780
 - Yeah, yeah, right.

1139
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,260
 - I've had some Forced March.

1140
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,100
 And did they use that,

1141
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,620
 'cause they use that, the Germans use that in the war.

1142
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:46,260
 Did the Brits use that as well, and the Allies generally?

1143
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,100
 - I think the Allies,

1144
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:50,020
 I think there was meth use all around, yeah, yeah.

1145
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:52,340
 The meth pills that were synthesized in the 30s.

1146
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,860
 - But maybe not for everybody, for people who,

1147
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:55,900
 I mean, obviously not for everybody,

1148
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,100
 but you know, as in maybe it would be for pilots,

1149
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,060
 rather than for standard...

1150
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,940
 - I think it was pilots to stay awake.

1151
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,900
 I think that's why the Allies use it, for sure.

1152
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,740
 - That's so interesting.

1153
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:05,580
 - So off the back of this,

1154
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,020
 I was just looking into supplies

1155
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,380
 that you take in the Arctic,

1156
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:11,020
 as in what you have to keep you going.

1157
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:17,500
 And, I mean, it seems like it was either cocaine or biscuits.

1158
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,220
 I said, no, it's like...

1159
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,500
 - It sounds like a student's fantasy, doesn't it?

1160
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,340
 - Yeah, you're right.

1161
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,180
 - What's on offer today?

1162
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,020
 - Same.

1163
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,940
 - So, get this, Captain Scott, right?

1164
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:30,180
 Scott of the Antarctic did loads of expeditions there.

1165
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:33,540
 He took some specially made biscuits,

1166
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,340
 which were glucose enriched,

1167
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,340
 and they're made by a firm called Huntley and Palmer.

1168
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:41,220
 But he set off with digestive, rich tea,

1169
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:45,460
 piti beurre, fancy lunch, ginger nuts,

1170
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:49,140
 as well as emergency Antarctic and small captain biscuits.

1171
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:49,980
 And later in his trip,

1172
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,260
 he got resupplied with more biscuits.

1173
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,700
 - I actually think that they're some of the worst biscuits

1174
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:57,220
 you've just named, like digestives and rich tea.

1175
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,540
 Where's the... - Rich tea, ginger nuts.

1176
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,780
 - The jammie dodger. - Jammie dodger, come on.

1177
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,020
 - Well, tragically, this was a pre-jammie dodger world.

1178
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:05,860
 I mean, maybe he would have made it back if he had to.

1179
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:09,060
 - On the first all-female expedition to the North Pole,

1180
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:13,020
 every woman involved eight four penguins per day.

1181
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:13,860
 - Wow.

1182
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,180
 - They don't have penguins, do they?

1183
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,780
 - They brought penguins from the Antarctic to the Arctic

1184
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:19,700
 solely to mince them up and eat them.

1185
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,540
 - Yeah, they're cruel,

1186
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:23,500
 and that's why they haven't sent women back to the North Pole.

1187
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,940
 This is, of course, biscuit penguins.

1188
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,300
 They were sponsored by McVitie's.

1189
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:31,460
 And so, McVitie's provided them with the hot nail down number,

1190
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,540
 maybe, but thousands of penguins, I believe,

1191
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,740
 and one of the women said they were told

1192
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:35,980
 to eat four penguins a day.

1193
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,100
 - Interesting, according to the biography,

1194
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:41,300
 Frigid Women by Sue Richards and Victoria Richards.

1195
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,620
 - That's brilliant.

1196
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,420
 - So this was two of the women who went on it.

1197
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:46,980
 They were given six biscuits per person per day

1198
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,100
 for the expedition.

1199
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:48,940
 - Oh, really?

1200
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,020
 Maybe the person who I read,

1201
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:52,460
 they got their biscuits nicks before they gave them to her.

1202
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,260
 - Yeah, that comes to yet.

1203
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,540
 - Interesting, because that many,

1204
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,220
 it must have been loads of days they were traveling.

1205
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,660
 - It was, it was a relay,

1206
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:01,100
 so it meant that four women at a time were going,

1207
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,540
 and then they would be airlifted out,

1208
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,780
 and the next slot would be airlifted

1209
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,220
 into wherever they were.

1210
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,260
 - That's cool.

1211
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,100
 - Yeah.

1212
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,340
 - I was thinking you could wear the biscuits

1213
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:10,140
 as a kind of extra layer of warmth,

1214
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,660
 but maybe not. - Wear the biscuits?

1215
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,940
 - Well, it's like you could make it,

1216
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,020
 'cause they're quite flat, aren't they?

1217
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,940
 They're kind of a waistcoat that was lined with penguins.

1218
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,460
 - And actually, they're two biscuits,

1219
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:21,100
 and in between there's like a little bit of chocolate

1220
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:21,940
 or something, right?

1221
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,260
 - Well, insulation, I'm thinking.

1222
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,100
 - Yeah, exactly.

1223
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,780
 - It just sounds like you're one of the members on the trip

1224
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,740
 who misheard wearing the biscuits,

1225
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,780
 and you've emerged covered in penguins.

1226
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:30,780
 - What year was this, by the way?

1227
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:34,260
 - It was 1997, and so I've got a question for you.

1228
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:37,020
 Remembering that it's 1997, and they're British,

1229
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:39,980
 and thinking what was happening in 1997 at the time,

1230
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:42,980
 what do you think the newspapers nicknamed them?

1231
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:43,820
 - The hand-owners.

1232
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:44,660
 - The hand-owners.

1233
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,380
 - Blair's frozen women.

1234
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,900
 - Go away from politics.

1235
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,020
 - Oh, the spice girls were big.

1236
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:51,860
 - Ah.

1237
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:52,940
 - And they were in the Arctic.

1238
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:53,780
 - Yeah, so.

1239
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,060
 - Cold, frozen spices?

1240
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,820
 - No, no, no.

1241
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:59,300
 - Wait, wait, say it again, say the ingredients.

1242
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,580
 - The spice girls were big.

1243
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,420
 - Yep.

1244
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:02,500
 - Girl power, girl power.

1245
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,820
 - They're going to the North Pole.

1246
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:04,660
 What nicknamed them?

1247
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,900
 - Girl polar, girl polar.

1248
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,380
 - Ziggazig Arctic.

1249
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:08,220
 - Jesus Christ.

1250
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,060
 - Girl polar.

1251
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,620
 - Wanna be the North Poles.

1252
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,460
 - No.

1253
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:14,460
 - To become, 16 become, no, two.

1254
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:17,580
 - Literally everyone listening has got this.

1255
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:19,980
 - Okay, okay, well done everyone.

1256
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,340
 - What do you get of the Arctic?

1257
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,180
 - Snow.

1258
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,220
 - As well as snow.

1259
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,060
 - Ice.

1260
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:24,900
 - Icey spice.

1261
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:25,740
 - Ice girls.

1262
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,220
 - The ice girls.

1263
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,060
 - Woohoo.

1264
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:30,380
 - Pew, pew, pew.

1265
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,220
 - Ice one down.

1266
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,780
 - Wow, straight away, straight in there.

1267
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,660
 - Sonic, Sonic Shriver.

1268
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:36,980
 - That's incredible.

1269
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:39,420
 - And one of the patrons of the ice girls

1270
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,780
 was Dawn French, the comedian.

1271
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:42,620
 - Yeah.

1272
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:45,340
 - And she told the press that she'd actually made the cut

1273
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:49,100
 to be on the expedition, but she decided to stay at home

1274
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,900
 and comfort all the husbands.

1275
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:51,740
 (laughing)

1276
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,940
 - That's so good, I'm sure you know that.

1277
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:56,620
 - One of the husbands dumped his wife while she was out there.

1278
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,900
 - Oh, while she was out there?

1279
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:58,740
 - Yeah.

1280
00:40:58,740 --> 00:40:59,580
 - She's married to Dawn French now.

1281
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,740
 (laughing)

1282
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:01,860
 - What, was it Lenny Henry?

1283
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:02,940
 - It was, yeah.

1284
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:05,820
 No, this was Anne who had triplets

1285
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,220
 and she'd never had any experience before.

1286
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,540
 She's this amazing explorer now.

1287
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:09,380
 - And Daniels, yeah.

1288
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:11,100
 - And Daniels, never done anything before.

1289
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:13,220
 But she, when they finished the expedition,

1290
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,340
 all the other women had letters from home

1291
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,460
 and she didn't have one

1292
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:18,540
 and it was a sign that her husband had decided to go on.

1293
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:19,860
 - Oh my gosh.

1294
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:22,100
 - I was talking to you about Rosie Stancer.

1295
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:22,940
 - Is she one of the--

1296
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:25,300
 - There's one of the arctic,

1297
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,060
 one of the frigid women, as the book has it.

1298
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,580
 So she was on it.

1299
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,820
 So get this, she's,

1300
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,740
 I think she's quite posh, like her--

1301
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,580
 - Ash ice.

1302
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:35,540
 - Posh ice, brilliant.

1303
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,980
 - Brilliant.

1304
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:39,020
 - So she, like Anne Daniels,

1305
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:40,460
 she went on to do a lot of other expeditions.

1306
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,460
 She did one, the Snickers South Pole Solo

1307
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:43,740
 and the Mars North Pole Solo.

1308
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,700
 So these are all chocolate and biscuit sponsored.

1309
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:50,300
 But her grandfather was also a wannabe, thank you, explorer.

1310
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,540
 He was the fourth Earl of Granville, right?

1311
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,140
 And he wanted to be a polar explorer,

1312
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,300
 but he was thwarted.

1313
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,220
 Can you guess why?

1314
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,980
 It was something about his body.

1315
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:00,420
 - He had a weird sort of inner ear thing,

1316
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:03,220
 but whenever he wanted to go north, he always went south.

1317
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:06,100
 - That's a very creative one, better than what I've got.

1318
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:06,940
 Shall I tell you?

1319
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:07,780
 - Yeah, yeah.

1320
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:09,260
 - He was too tall.

1321
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,100
 - Did he?

1322
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:10,940
 - To go on an arctic--

1323
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,260
 - Could you hit your head on the top of the earth?

1324
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:14,140
 (laughing)

1325
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:16,260
 - 'Cause he wouldn't fit in the tent.

1326
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:17,820
 He was too tall for the tent.

1327
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,260
 - So his feet would be sticking out.

1328
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:20,780
 - Yeah, and that would obviously kill

1329
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,340
 all the men in the tent with the cold.

1330
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:25,980
 - Could he not do like the kind of, the embryo position?

1331
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:26,900
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1332
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:29,060
 - He was, he was, I mean, maybe this was an excuse

1333
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:29,980
 and it was his personality,

1334
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:33,380
 but he thought he was too tall to fit in the expedition tent.

1335
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:35,140
 - I thought he was five foot eight.

1336
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,260
 - No, no, too tall.

1337
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:38,100
 - Could you get a bigger tent?

1338
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:38,940
 - No!

1339
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,260
 - No, they don't exist.

1340
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:43,420
 My cob knobs bring something that doesn't exist, mate.

1341
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:44,260
 - I can't believe you just called

1342
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:45,580
 the feet all possessed in the embryo position.

1343
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:46,420
 - I know, I can't remember.

1344
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:47,260
 - The embryo position.

1345
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:48,100
 - Yeah.

1346
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:48,940
 - We've got a phrase for that.

1347
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:51,100
 (laughing)

1348
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,420
 - So I read a story which is that

1349
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:54,580
 and Daniel's mother triplets,

1350
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:56,420
 one of her things to keep her going

1351
00:42:56,420 --> 00:43:00,140
 was to just say her kid's names over and over again.

1352
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:02,380
 How loud the triplets just repeat their names.

1353
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:03,220
 - Baby ice.

1354
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:05,860
 (laughing)

1355
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:08,140
 - But they had very near death experiences.

1356
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:08,980
 It was so hairy.

1357
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:09,820
 - Scary ice.

1358
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:10,940
 (laughing)

1359
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:11,780
 - Jesus.

1360
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:12,620
 (laughing)

1361
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:13,980
 - Okay, now we just cross off three.

1362
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:15,420
 We've got two more to get, yeah.

1363
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:18,140
 Done posh, we've done scary, and we've done baby.

1364
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:19,340
 So that leaves sporty and ginger.

1365
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:20,500
 - Sporty and ginger.

1366
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,380
 - Wait, oh they didn't take ginger nuts.

1367
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:23,220
 They took the penguins.

1368
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:24,060
 - Yeah.

1369
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:24,900
 - Damn it.

1370
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:25,740
 - They're all sporty.

1371
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:26,580
 - Okay.

1372
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:27,500
 - But yeah, the mother daughter,

1373
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:28,740
 the daughter rung her mom to say,

1374
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,740
 "Hey, I'm doing this Arctic expedition."

1375
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:32,980
 And the mom says, her daughter invited her,

1376
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:35,740
 the daughter says, she definitely didn't invite her mom,

1377
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:37,060
 but her mom decided to go.

1378
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:39,140
 But they both fell through the ice at one point.

1379
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:40,340
 So the Arctic moves.

1380
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:42,460
 They didn't quite realize how much when you're exploring,

1381
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:45,140
 it shifts and moves and the ice was creaking

1382
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:48,100
 and they're wearing skis and they both fell through the ice

1383
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,340
 and had to like swim in the skis.

1384
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:51,180
 - What?

1385
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:52,220
 - And she said she just remembered,

1386
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:54,420
 while also towing these supply wagons,

1387
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:56,420
 they all had a supply wagon they had to tow behind them.

1388
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:57,260
 - And they survived?

1389
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:58,660
 - Yeah, they somehow survived.

1390
00:43:58,660 --> 00:43:59,500
 Incredibly.

1391
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:02,500
 But then it sounds like God was watching

1392
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:05,220
 'cause they ended up, two of them ended up

1393
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:07,620
 managing to climb out onto one side of the ice,

1394
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:09,180
 but their group was on the other.

1395
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,060
 So they were on either side of a river

1396
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:12,660
 and they just walked either side of this river

1397
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:14,380
 and they were getting more and more divergent

1398
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:15,980
 and they realized they were not gonna be able

1399
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:17,300
 to get back to each other.

1400
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:20,140
 And then suddenly the ice started moving

1401
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:23,540
 and the river closed up and the ice joined together.

1402
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:24,380
 - Wow.

1403
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:25,380
 - But it would have been very precarious

1404
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:27,380
 as in to walk across that is quite nerve wracking.

1405
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:28,940
 You would have had to tread.

1406
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:32,100
 You would have had to walk quite gingerly, spice.

1407
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:32,940
 Ice, ice.

1408
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:36,540
 James saw that coming from such a distance.

1409
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:39,860
 - What's that on the horizon?

1410
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:41,180
 Is it the North Pole?

1411
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:43,260
 No, is that these junk?

1412
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:47,060
 - Oh, it doesn't feel as good when you get there.

1413
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,640
 (upbeat music)

1414
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:56,660
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show

1415
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:57,980
 and that is my fact.

1416
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:01,620
 My fact this week is that the crowd science expert

1417
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:04,500
 who designed and mapped out the cue

1418
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,580
 is called Professor Keith Still.

1419
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:10,420
 - Did you try and say keep?

1420
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:11,420
 It sounds like keep.

1421
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:13,380
 - So his name's Keith Still.

1422
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:14,460
 It looks like keep still.

1423
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:16,180
 Would you say it in a weird way?

1424
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:17,820
 - What's the cues do?

1425
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:19,660
 They moved, I think.

1426
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:21,980
 - But this one famously was a very long one

1427
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:24,740
 that required you to keep still.

1428
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:26,820
 - Actually we tried to keep walking for about five months.

1429
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:28,940
 - It did, but what were you doing when you weren't walking?

1430
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:30,940
 - I suppose you would keep still.

1431
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:31,780
 - That's right.

1432
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:33,700
 - They always say keep still.

1433
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:36,260
 - This is the cue for Elizabeth II.

1434
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:37,940
 - This is the passing of the queen.

1435
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:39,860
 There was this extraordinary cue

1436
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:42,900
 that lasted somewhere between five miles onwards.

1437
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:44,380
 And if you were in it,

1438
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:45,700
 if you were someone who came to London

1439
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:46,540
 to be part of it,

1440
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:48,500
 you could be waiting between nine and 24 hours

1441
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,420
 to eventually get to the front of the cue.

1442
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:54,860
 - Professor Keith Still is someone who helps.

1443
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:55,700
 - You could say his name normally,

1444
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:57,020
 now we've done the facts.

1445
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:58,180
 - We've explained the joke,

1446
00:45:58,180 --> 00:45:59,300
 which always works.

1447
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:01,060
 Now let's just call him by his name.

1448
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:03,900
 - So he is from Burton and Kendall in Cumbria

1449
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:06,100
 and his job is a crowd scientist.

1450
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:07,780
 So for the last 30 years,

1451
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:09,860
 he's been doing this as a job

1452
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:12,700
 and he was the person who was in charge of creating

1453
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:15,220
 a line that was gonna be one that meant

1454
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:16,220
 that people felt safe

1455
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:18,820
 and that they had toilet stops along the way.

1456
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:21,500
 And he had to, and you know, medical assistants

1457
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,260
 and he had to devise it for something

1458
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:24,380
 that was twice the length.

1459
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:25,220
 - Where would it have come?

1460
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:26,060
 - I don't know.

1461
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:26,900
 I'm not sure if we were ever--

1462
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:27,740
 - Into the English Channel.

1463
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:29,820
 When you dropped it into the English Channel.

1464
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:31,300
 - Because they did stop it at one point,

1465
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:32,420
 they said we're at capacity.

1466
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:34,380
 So they didn't use the proposed route.

1467
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:35,700
 But then what they had was a pen

1468
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,380
 where a sort of secondary cue started

1469
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:39,180
 where you could then go from that second cue.

1470
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:40,020
 - Cue for the cue.

1471
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:41,500
 - Cue for the cue, exactly.

1472
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:44,340
 - God, yeah, I remember that happened.

1473
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:46,540
 I didn't go clubbing very much as a student.

1474
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:48,180
 - You're a stonisher now.

1475
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,900
 - No, no, no, it's true.

1476
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:51,100
 But there was, I think partly

1477
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,860
 because one of the first times I went--

1478
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:56,020
 - Your friends said you were too tall, didn't they?

1479
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:58,580
 - Yeah, apparently the club had a very low ceiling.

1480
00:46:58,580 --> 00:46:59,920
 - They always do, yeah.

1481
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,180
 - Yeah, I would have hated it.

1482
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:04,000
 No, there was a club called The Bridge,

1483
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,940
 which was you'd go to.

1484
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:09,180
 And there was a, you'd cue up for ages

1485
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:10,300
 and I did cue up for ages.

1486
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:11,700
 And then you get into, I got in

1487
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:13,180
 and it turned out that the club I got into

1488
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:15,220
 was actually a cue for the actual club.

1489
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:16,060
 - No.

1490
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:17,580
 - Yeah, there was this whole,

1491
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:18,780
 and it had a bar and everything,

1492
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:20,660
 but it was basically the cue for The Bridge

1493
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:22,060
 as in you get given a ticket

1494
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:23,340
 and when they called out certain tickets

1495
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,740
 you could go into the actual club.

1496
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:25,740
 But I cue for about 40 minutes

1497
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:27,420
 to get into the cue club, which was rubbish.

1498
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:28,340
 - You must feel like an absolute chump.

1499
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:29,700
 I've been to The Bridge multiple times.

1500
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:32,140
 I don't remember the old double cue.

1501
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,300
 - Oh well, Anna probably walks up to the front

1502
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:35,500
 and says, "I'm Anna Szczenski."

1503
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,100
 - Yeah, they let me in the back hugely.

1504
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:38,860
 - And you're DJing, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1505
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:40,860
 (laughing)

1506
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:44,660
 - It is actually quite impressive the level of standing.

1507
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:47,260
 So I hadn't really thought about the fact

1508
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:49,220
 that you would be actually standing up

1509
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:50,180
 'cause you are constantly moving,

1510
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:51,220
 so you can't really sit down.

1511
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:52,580
 You were standing up for 24 hours.

1512
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:55,100
 And lots of people needed medical treatment.

1513
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:57,820
 291 people needed medical assistance

1514
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:00,580
 just on one day with 17 having to go to hospital.

1515
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:02,060
 - No man, it's a lot.

1516
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:03,660
 - Dehydrating and fainting, it is quite a lot.

1517
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:05,980
 - Of course they could have just not had a cue.

1518
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:07,780
 I mean, these days we do have systems

1519
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:09,180
 to stop people from having to cue

1520
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:11,060
 for miles and miles and miles.

1521
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:12,020
 - What, like booking in?

1522
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:13,860
 - Yeah, you could have just gone on the website,

1523
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:16,860
 said, "I'm gonna come between one o'clock and two o'clock."

1524
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:19,340
 And then the cue would never have gotten longer than an hour.

1525
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:20,340
 - Why is the fun in that?

1526
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:22,100
 What would the news have done for a week?

1527
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:23,140
 - That's the point, isn't it?

1528
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:25,460
 The point is that it's like this ceremonial thing

1529
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:26,900
 that they wanted to show how much,

1530
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:28,100
 how important it was and stuff.

1531
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:29,100
 - Yeah, exactly.

1532
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:31,340
 - Professor Still, Keith Still.

1533
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:34,140
 (laughing)

1534
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:37,060
 He got into queuing, first of all, several decades ago.

1535
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:39,620
 He was at a Freddie Mercury gig.

1536
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:42,020
 It was an AIDS awareness gig, and it was at Wembley,

1537
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:43,940
 and he and his friends, they were stuck in queue for hours,

1538
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:46,460
 and his friends were all quite annoyed.

1539
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:48,300
 And he was quite mathematically minded

1540
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,620
 and thought, "Oh, God, this is really interesting, actually."

1541
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:53,260
 And so he got into queuing, and he then is--

1542
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:55,300
 - Interestingly, queuing for the Queen.

1543
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:56,140
 - Yeah!

1544
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:56,980
 (gasping)

1545
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:57,820
 - And queuing for Queen.

1546
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:59,180
 - Oh my God!

1547
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:01,180
 We've blown the shit wide open.

1548
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:04,660
 His next thing he did, he went to Wembley Stadium,

1549
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:07,220
 and he got special permission

1550
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:09,020
 from the whoever's running the grounds,

1551
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:11,700
 and he would spend his weekends, for ages,

1552
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:15,780
 sitting above the players' tunnel, watching the crowds.

1553
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:16,620
 - Oh!

1554
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,660
 The match was going on, but he's not watching it.

1555
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:20,020
 - I think he wouldn't have been paying any attention

1556
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:20,860
 to the match, yeah.

1557
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:22,940
 You just see this guy sitting above the, yeah.

1558
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:25,820
 - He can't, he said of the queue,

1559
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:27,260
 the one, the recent queue,

1560
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:29,300
 he would not have been able to withstand

1561
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,980
 the length of time it required to get to the front.

1562
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:34,300
 He himself can no longer queue within--

1563
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:35,140
 - Even queue.

1564
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:36,260
 - The queues he decides.

1565
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:37,100
 - Yeah.

1566
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:37,940
 - Because he's old.

1567
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:39,180
 - He's got an arthritic hip.

1568
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:40,020
 - Yeah.

1569
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:44,020
 - That must require him to keep still

1570
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:45,220
 more often than he'd like.

1571
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:46,740
 - Absolutely.

1572
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:49,980
 - It's funny 'cause he's got a lovely website,

1573
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:50,940
 and he lists his hobbies on it.

1574
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:51,780
 - Does he?

1575
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:52,620
 I didn't see his website.

1576
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:53,460
 - Oh, yeah, it's a great website.

1577
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:55,700
 Yeah, he owns multiple motorbikes,

1578
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:57,300
 and he plays bowls.

1579
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:58,140
 - Does he?

1580
00:49:58,140 --> 00:49:59,220
 - That was quite a rare combo, I think,

1581
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:00,500
 like having a Harley-Davidson

1582
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,340
 and playing crown green bowls.

1583
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:03,980
 - Is it?

1584
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:04,820
 - Well, one seems quite hard to call.

1585
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:05,640
 - No, you're right.

1586
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,960
 In Hell's Angels, they were famous for their bowls, Matt.

1587
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,540
 - Sorry, they're the only people at motorbike.

1588
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:10,860
 I forgot that as well.

1589
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:11,900
 - He's got a big Harley-Davidson.

1590
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:12,740
 He's got a--

1591
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:15,940
 - I associate both with real ale pubs.

1592
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:17,680
 - I bet he loves a real ale.

1593
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,060
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1594
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:22,500
 Some other animals, queue, I didn't know this.

1595
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:23,340
 - Okay.

1596
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:24,180
 - Yeah, so--

1597
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:25,340
 - Hunts, probably, I reckon.

1598
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:26,180
 - Hunts.

1599
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:27,620
 - Yeah, must do, yeah.

1600
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:30,300
 Fish, queue, there are fish which queue.

1601
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:32,620
 Yeah, there's small goby fish, right?

1602
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:34,380
 They have this thing where they have a mating queue.

1603
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:36,140
 Okay, this is really, this is a bit sexy, actually.

1604
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:38,860
 So only the top male and female mate, right?

1605
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:40,740
 And all the other females have to wait in a queue

1606
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:42,020
 before they can have sex.

1607
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:44,340
 I think with the top male, but maybe it's actually,

1608
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:46,020
 there's a queue, there's a sort of queue of males,

1609
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:47,140
 I don't know.

1610
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:49,260
 But basically, to organize the queue,

1611
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:51,900
 they do it by a pecking order of sexiness.

1612
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:54,300
 And sexiness is body mass for them.

1613
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:56,940
 So the biggest female is the sexiest one

1614
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:58,380
 and gets to have sex first, right?

1615
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:00,060
 And then the next biggest and so on.

1616
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:02,140
 And they can measure, you know how in school

1617
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:04,580
 you had to line up for fire drills and things

1618
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:05,980
 with a height order.

1619
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:06,980
 - Did you, okay?

1620
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:07,820
 - Well, we did, yeah.

1621
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:09,820
 - Well, you're not too tall for that.

1622
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:12,040
 - I was always left to burn, wasn't it?

1623
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:14,860
 (laughing)

1624
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:16,660
 But the fish can tell their body mass, right?

1625
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:20,700
 So if the difference is more than 5% of their body mass,

1626
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,340
 like between one female and the next,

1627
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:23,940
 they will queue neatly, right?

1628
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:25,540
 And because they know who's bigger they can see.

1629
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:27,180
 - Well, 'cause they've all got scales, haven't they?

1630
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:29,440
 (laughing)

1631
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:32,660
 - But if the difference is smaller than 5%

1632
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:34,180
 between two females in the queue,

1633
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:36,260
 the smaller one will try and queue jump.

1634
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,780
 And we'll sort of say, this is, there's enough,

1635
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:40,260
 there's a small enough difference, I think I could do it.

1636
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:42,100
 And then the bigger one will drive it out of the group.

1637
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:43,660
 We'll sort of force it out of the queue.

1638
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:44,660
 They'll have a fight.

1639
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:47,100
 - Well, I think during that fight they both lose weight.

1640
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:47,940
 (laughing)

1641
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:49,380
 - This is what they, okay.

1642
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:50,700
 - Okay, it's similar to that.

1643
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:53,660
 Smaller fish will sometimes adjust their own size.

1644
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:56,240
 They will lose weight to avoid presenting a challenge

1645
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,460
 to the fish that's bigger than them.

1646
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:59,260
 So they don't get in a fight and they don't queue jump.

1647
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:01,340
 They say, right, I'll just shrink my own body.

1648
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:02,620
 - How do they do that?

1649
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,020
 - I guess they don't eat for a while.

1650
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:06,540
 - Oh, in the lead up to the queue, not as in, okay.

1651
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:07,720
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Not on the spot.

1652
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:11,260
 They can't do like a special, like shit everything else.

1653
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:14,900
 - Famous queue, when McDonald's opened in Moscow.

1654
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:15,740
 - Oh yeah.

1655
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:20,660
 - In 1990, people queued for six hours to get a McDonald's.

1656
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:25,100
 They served 30,000 people on the first day.

1657
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:29,620
 And one Big Mac cost 3.75 rubles.

1658
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:32,620
 And a monthly wage was 150 rubles.

1659
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:34,340
 So that is the equivalent today

1660
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:38,260
 of a Big Mac costing 52 pounds, 78 pence.

1661
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:39,260
 - Wow. - Wow.

1662
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:41,980
 - Yeah, and people queued for six hours to get that.

1663
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:42,820
 - Jesus.

1664
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:44,480
 - 'Cause if someone tells you it's that expensive,

1665
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:45,300
 you think it must be worth it.

1666
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:46,140
 - Exactly, yeah.

1667
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:51,140
 There was 700 seats inside and 200 outside of this,

1668
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:53,820
 this McDonald's in Pushkin Sky Square.

1669
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:57,860
 And so 900 people, that's about the same as a Globe Theater.

1670
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:59,940
 It was the largest McDonald's in the world

1671
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:01,900
 until McDonald's left Russia.

1672
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:02,980
 - Wow. - Wow.

1673
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:06,580
 - But in a sense, isn't McDonald's really the,

1674
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:10,460
 you know, the theater sort of space for,

1675
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:12,220
 - Keep going, you're getting there.

1676
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:13,220
 - You know, it's like.

1677
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:14,700
 - I've got no idea where you're going.

1678
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:16,380
 - I'm wondering where you're going to believe in him.

1679
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:17,460
 - Believe in him.

1680
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:18,300
 - He can do this.

1681
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:20,100
 - You know, what do you see at McDonald's late night?

1682
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:21,100
 You see drama.

1683
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:21,940
 - Yeah.

1684
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:23,420
 - You know, you go to a McDonald's,

1685
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:25,780
 and all human life is there, kind of like a theater.

1686
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:29,940
 - My Beth is a Macbeth, I love her Macbeth too.

1687
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,460
 - So much there for you, Andy.

1688
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:32,980
 - That was what you were going for.

1689
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:35,260
 - I feel like I did a lot of work in the midfield there,

1690
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:37,540
 and I just slaughtered at home.

1691
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:40,820
 I'm happy with that. - The shearer of your jokes.

1692
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:45,060
 We did on QI once that the way we load airplanes

1693
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:46,580
 is totally wrong.

1694
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:48,380
 So you know when you get, you're waiting for a plane

1695
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:51,460
 and they say, if you're in rows 50 to 70,

1696
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:53,260
 please come forward now.

1697
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:55,980
 And they load the back first, which seems to make sense.

1698
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:57,940
 Well, actually, that's the least efficient way to do it.

1699
00:53:57,940 --> 00:53:59,260
 It's way more efficient just to say,

1700
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:01,020
 everyone randomly get on the plane.

1701
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:04,540
 - Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, close the door in four minutes.

1702
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:05,380
 Go.

1703
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:06,540
 - You mean the easy jet system.

1704
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:08,660
 (laughing)

1705
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:10,740
 - Leave the kids go.

1706
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:12,260
 - Well, the great thing is if you have kids,

1707
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:13,940
 you get to the front of the queue.

1708
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:15,900
 - Yeah, although that is one of the best ways to do it

1709
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:17,220
 is to make sure the slow loaders,

1710
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:20,100
 i.e. people with kids do get on first.

1711
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:21,180
 - That's why they do it, I guess.

1712
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:23,340
 - But yeah, someone studied it mathematically

1713
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:24,620
 and realized that loading from the back

1714
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:26,060
 is actually slower than doing it randomly

1715
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:28,100
 'cause people bunch up and they block each other,

1716
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,940
 but you're not loading the empty spaces.

1717
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:31,340
 And actually, one really good way to do it

1718
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:34,300
 is do window seats, then aisle seats, then middle seats.

1719
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:35,140
 - Oh, cool.

1720
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:35,980
 - Vice versa.

1721
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:36,820
 - Yeah, that's mad.

1722
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:38,460
 - I mean, it is an insane way of doing it.

1723
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:39,300
 - That's insane.

1724
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:40,820
 - 'Cause you're with, let's say you're three people

1725
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:42,180
 going on a plane, a family.

1726
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:43,020
 - Yeah.

1727
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:44,260
 - All right, just dad first.

1728
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:45,100
 (laughing)

1729
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:46,860
 - Now the four-year-old on their own.

1730
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:49,220
 (laughing)

1731
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:50,060
 Families are like,

1732
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:51,380
 "I do think that is a cool way of doing it."

1733
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:52,940
 Because then, everyone's slotted,

1734
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:55,180
 everyone goes to the end of their row where the windows are

1735
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:58,300
 and no one's faffing about in the corridor bit of the plane.

1736
00:54:58,300 --> 00:54:59,420
 - They're not doing it on purpose, Andy.

1737
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:01,340
 They just need to get their bags into the--

1738
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:02,980
 - I'm not sure the window seat knocks that out

1739
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:05,020
 because you still need to get your bag into the top bit.

1740
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:06,020
 - Well, I think the key thing to do

1741
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:07,660
 is everyone just carries the bag with them

1742
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:09,860
 and just holds it in their arms until the plane's taken off.

1743
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:11,660
 Then you can put it up in the racks, Vove.

1744
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:13,420
 - I don't think you're allowed to hold the bags

1745
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:16,660
 in your arms, especially if you're on an emergency exit seat.

1746
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:17,500
 - Yeah, that's true, yeah.

1747
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:20,460
 - Andy, I'm afraid, I'm afraid to sit in front of you.

1748
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:21,500
 Anyway.

1749
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:22,820
 - Oh, well, don't fly.

1750
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,740
 (laughing)

1751
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:26,980
 - I was reading a website called LineLogic

1752
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:30,060
 and they specialize in looking at public guidances

1753
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:31,660
 and line management solutions.

1754
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:34,300
 And so they go into businesses and try and sort out

1755
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:36,060
 how they can best manage their crowds and stuff.

1756
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:40,300
 And they say that the word faffing directly relates

1757
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:43,340
 to the idea of getting to the front of a queue

1758
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,180
 and then waiting for that person

1759
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:46,980
 who's just in front of you, who's paid

1760
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:49,100
 to sort of gather their things together.

1761
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:51,260
 The faffing that they do of sort of like

1762
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:53,100
 putting their wallet back and stuff.

1763
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:54,420
 - Well, like that's the first instance

1764
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:55,260
 of the word faffing.

1765
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:56,620
 - It's what this website is.

1766
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:57,460
 - What is this website?

1767
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:58,300
 Who are these people?

1768
00:55:58,300 --> 00:55:59,120
 - It's LineLogic.

1769
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:00,460
 - What are their credentials?

1770
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:01,620
 - I'm back 'em, that's great.

1771
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:02,660
 - But they say that faffing time

1772
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:05,100
 takes roughly 3.17 seconds.

1773
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:07,900
 That's the average faff that you'll have, yeah.

1774
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:09,340
 - That's plausible.

1775
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:11,660
 'Cause you can pride yourself on being a non-faffer

1776
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:13,700
 once you're at the front of a queue.

1777
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:15,100
 Right now I've got my wallet, I'm ready,

1778
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:16,180
 I'm ready to put the card away,

1779
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:17,940
 I'm ready to grab the thing, go, you know.

1780
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:19,020
 Or you can faff.

1781
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:19,860
 - Yeah.

1782
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:20,700
 - I wonder which you are, Andy.

1783
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:21,540
 - Yeah.

1784
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:22,380
 (laughing)

1785
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:24,260
 - I pride myself on my non-faffing.

1786
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:26,860
 - You really amazed us, really.

1787
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:29,740
 - Oh, you guys were expecting that, I see, yeah.

1788
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:31,220
 - It felt like a weighted survey

1789
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:33,620
 when you explained the difference between the two.

1790
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:36,140
 - Because they do say some people are absolutely awesome

1791
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:39,340
 and they always know exactly how to leave a check out.

1792
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:41,180
 - And you get these complete arseholes.

1793
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:44,060
 - Well, I panic am annoying the people behind me, basically.

1794
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:44,900
 - Yeah, yeah.

1795
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:46,540
 - The time when you finished your transaction

1796
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:49,340
 feels, you know, longer to you.

1797
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:51,300
 - I agree, I often rush off without my shopping.

1798
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:53,140
 (laughing)

1799
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:54,900
 - But I feel you're the type of personality

1800
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:56,860
 that would wanna make sure that was acknowledged.

1801
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:58,700
 And then so you would somehow waste the person

1802
00:56:58,700 --> 00:56:59,980
 behind you's time going.

1803
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:00,820
 - Wait, why am I--

1804
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:03,740
 - No worries, get in out of your way there so quickly.

1805
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:07,580
 - Oh, just don't worry, just another day being a hero, yeah.

1806
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:09,420
 - I reckon you just go, "Beep!"

1807
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:10,260
 - Yeah.

1808
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,540
 - Three seconds, 24, very good.

1809
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:14,380
 - Enjoy that extra second I'll say you do.

1810
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:16,180
 (laughing)

1811
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:18,760
 (upbeat music)

1812
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:22,780
