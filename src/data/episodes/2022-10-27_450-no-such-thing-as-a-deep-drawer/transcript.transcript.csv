00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:17,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:17,00:00:19,"of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast"
00:00:19,00:00:22,coming to you from the QI offices in Covern Garden.
00:00:22,00:00:24,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:24,00:00:26,"I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,"
00:00:26,00:00:28,Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin.
00:00:28,00:00:30,"And once again, we have gathered round the microphones"
00:00:30,00:00:33,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:00:33,00:00:36,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:36,00:00:40,"Starting with fact number one, that is James."
00:00:40,00:00:43,"- Okay, my fact this week is that in 1910,"
00:00:43,00:00:47,the World Health Organization tried to ban kissing.
00:00:47,00:00:48,- Wow.
00:00:48,00:00:50,You think that'd be a bigger story
00:00:50,00:00:51,"given such a huge organization, right?"
00:00:51,00:00:54,- Especially as it happened 30 years before they existed.
00:00:54,00:00:55,- Yes.
00:00:55,00:00:56,- You would think so.
00:00:56,00:00:57,Thank you.
00:00:57,00:00:58,- What's going on here?
00:00:58,00:00:59,"- If you listen very carefully,"
00:00:59,00:01:03,you will have heard me say the world's health organization
00:01:03,00:01:05,as opposed to the more commonly known
00:01:05,00:01:07,world health organization.
00:01:07,00:01:09,And this was an organization.
00:01:09,00:01:11,"And when I say an organization,"
00:01:11,00:01:16,I mean really one woman in America called Imogene Recton.
00:01:16,00:01:20,And she decided that everyone should stop kissing.
00:01:20,00:01:23,And she got all the newspapers and invented a load
00:01:23,00:01:25,of badges and pledges and stuff like that.
00:01:25,00:01:28,"And really thought that if people stopped kissing,"
00:01:28,00:01:30,"then maybe we could stop the spread of disease,"
00:01:30,00:01:33,"things like consumption, typhus, all that kind of stuff."
00:01:33,00:01:34,- Yeah.
00:01:34,00:01:36,"- She kind of, she kind of been completely wrong."
00:01:36,00:01:36,- Yeah.
00:01:36,00:01:39,"- If everyone stopped kissing everyone else,"
00:01:39,00:01:41,we'd have fewer diseases.
00:01:41,00:01:41,- Yeah.
00:01:41,00:01:44,"- Well, we did try it for half a year in 2020,"
00:01:44,00:01:45,if you remember.
00:01:45,00:01:46,- And no one got a cold.
00:01:46,00:01:48,"So, you know, I'm just saying maybe the cost"
00:01:48,00:01:50,is greater than the benefit.
00:01:50,00:01:52,"- Yeah, but I feel like she was almost ahead of her time"
00:01:52,00:01:55,understanding then about exchange of possible germs.
00:01:55,00:01:57,"I mean, our mouths are rank."
00:01:57,00:01:59,We've got like billions of bacteria in them.
00:01:59,00:02:01,I know a lot of them are probably good bacteria.
00:02:01,00:02:05,But I think there was a study done that had people drink
00:02:05,00:02:07,like a yakult or a probiotic drink
00:02:07,00:02:09,and then had them snog their partner.
00:02:09,00:02:12,And they found the 80 million bacteria transferred
00:02:12,00:02:14,from one face to the other.
00:02:14,00:02:15,- Bacteria is tiny though.
00:02:15,00:02:16,"Yeah, 80 million."
00:02:16,00:02:17,- 80 million.
00:02:17,00:02:18,"- We don't know how much that is, do we?"
00:02:18,00:02:19,"- Is there everything where it's like,"
00:02:19,00:02:24,"oh, three bacteria transferred, it's gonna be big, right?"
00:02:24,00:02:25,- It's such a good point.
00:02:25,00:02:27,"- Even if three bacteria transferred before long,"
00:02:27,00:02:28,"there's gonna be more than,"
00:02:28,00:02:29,"there's gonna be four, five, six."
00:02:29,00:02:31,"- There you go, that's true, there you go."
00:02:31,00:02:31,- They are rampant.
00:02:31,00:02:32,- She does sound amazing.
00:02:32,00:02:33,- Yeah.
00:02:33,00:02:34,- Imogene as well.
00:02:34,00:02:35,- Imogene.
00:02:35,00:02:38,"- Weirdly, some newspapers call her Imogene,"
00:02:38,00:02:40,but I think they might be misprints.
00:02:40,00:02:42,'Cause most of them say Imogene.
00:02:42,00:02:43,- She got a lot of support.
00:02:43,00:02:44,She got some support.
00:02:44,00:02:45,"She got a thousand acolytes,"
00:02:45,00:02:47,which I think is a good hit rate
00:02:47,00:02:48,for this slightly dramatic campaign.
00:02:48,00:02:49,- She's got a number of acolytes.
00:02:49,00:02:50,- Yeah.
00:02:50,00:02:52,"Well, including 70 brides"
00:02:52,00:02:54,who declined to be kissed at their own weddings.
00:02:54,00:02:56,"- Which I think, yeah."
00:02:56,00:02:57,- Yeah.
00:02:57,00:02:58,- You may now kiss a bride.
00:02:58,00:02:59,"No, you may not."
00:02:59,00:03:00,- Yeah.
00:03:00,00:03:02,"- So in the article that you sent over, James,"
00:03:02,00:03:03,"when you found this,"
00:03:03,00:03:05,"there was a nice little thing that she,"
00:03:05,00:03:08,it starts off by saying that she'd convinced her husband
00:03:08,00:03:12,"of the risks associated with promiscuous kissing,"
00:03:12,00:03:13,which sounds like she had a bit of a dog in the race
00:03:13,00:03:14,to begin with.
00:03:14,00:03:16,"Yeah, she had a husband."
00:03:16,00:03:17,"- So he was a big kisser, right?"
00:03:17,00:03:19,"- Well, I think what it sounds like,"
00:03:19,00:03:21,"reading further into the article,"
00:03:21,00:03:24,is that kissing on the lips and kissing generally
00:03:24,00:03:25,was much more what you just did.
00:03:25,00:03:26,"If you had parties at the house,"
00:03:26,00:03:28,everyone would kiss each other on the lips.
00:03:28,00:03:29,"Women would kiss each other,"
00:03:29,00:03:30,men would kiss men.
00:03:30,00:03:30,- 1910.
00:03:30,00:03:31,- That's my party.
00:03:31,00:03:34,- That's what her husband was telling her anyway.
00:03:34,00:03:35,"First of all, the keys go in the bowl,"
00:03:35,00:03:36,"then we start kissing,"
00:03:36,00:03:38,and then we'll see what happens.
00:03:38,00:03:40,"- Yeah, I don't think men were snogging each other that much."
00:03:40,00:03:42,"By 1910, there've been phases when the kiss has been in,"
00:03:42,00:03:44,but I think her husband's been just spinning out yarn.
00:03:44,00:03:45,- I did just throw that in.
00:03:45,00:03:46,"I have to admit,"
00:03:46,00:03:49,it was definitely said women were kissing women.
00:03:49,00:03:51,"I thought, well, men should be kissing men."
00:03:51,00:03:52,- I was in France recently.
00:03:52,00:03:54,"I saw, I was in the South of France,"
00:03:54,00:03:55,and I was in a particularly kissy region.
00:03:55,00:03:56,- Oh yeah.
00:03:56,00:03:57,- It was a very kissy region.
00:03:57,00:03:59,I think I saw some people kissing four times.
00:03:59,00:03:59,- Yeah.
00:03:59,00:04:00,- But there's more.
00:04:00,00:04:01,- Way more.
00:04:01,00:04:03,"- I think you do get, there are fives definitely."
00:04:03,00:04:04,- I've had a good five or six.
00:04:04,00:04:05,- I've had a good five or six.
00:04:05,00:04:06,- You've had a six kiss.
00:04:06,00:04:08,"- Yeah, I lived in France for three months"
00:04:08,00:04:09,with my grandmother in 2003.
00:04:09,00:04:10,I've had a six.
00:04:10,00:04:11,You start counting when it.
00:04:11,00:04:12,- Six.
00:04:12,00:04:13,"- Six, I've had a six."
00:04:13,00:04:15,Maybe she wanted to give me six.
00:04:15,00:04:16,- I've seen a five.
00:04:16,00:04:17,- Your grandmother.
00:04:17,00:04:17,(laughing)
00:04:17,00:04:19,"- No, her oldie mates."
00:04:19,00:04:21,- All the grandmas at the retirement.
00:04:21,00:04:22,Maybe they forget.
00:04:22,00:04:23,Maybe they forgot.
00:04:23,00:04:24,(laughing)
00:04:24,00:04:26,"Halfway through, they're like, ah."
00:04:26,00:04:27,- What am I on?
00:04:27,00:04:27,- I'm gonna start again.
00:04:27,00:04:29,"- You can be stuck in the old people's name for hours,"
00:04:29,00:04:30,go on you.
00:04:30,00:04:31,- Think about older people kissing.
00:04:31,00:04:34,This was actually one of Imogene's theories.
00:04:34,00:04:37,And she thought that if she could stop older people
00:04:37,00:04:38,"from kissing each other,"
00:04:38,00:04:41,"and actually more like stopping them from kissing children,"
00:04:41,00:04:44,"then eventually when the older generation died out,"
00:04:44,00:04:46,so kissing would die out.
00:04:46,00:04:48,'Cause the children wouldn't have got it
00:04:48,00:04:50,into their system that it's a thing that you do.
00:04:50,00:04:51,That was her plan.
00:04:51,00:04:52,- That's interesting.
00:04:52,00:04:54,"Probably would have worked if she'd, again, if."
00:04:54,00:04:56,- If she's got more than a thousand acolytes.
00:04:56,00:04:57,- Yeah.
00:04:57,00:04:58,- Yeah.
00:04:58,00:04:58,- Yeah.
00:04:58,00:05:00,"- Look at this cultural thing, you know, it's a learned thing."
00:05:00,00:05:01,- We assume it is.
00:05:01,00:05:02,"Yeah, I think there's some debate, isn't there?"
00:05:02,00:05:04,But I think we assume it's a learned thing largely
00:05:04,00:05:08,because about just over half of societies don't do it.
00:05:08,00:05:09,- Yeah.
00:05:09,00:05:13,So the number is 46% do do it of cultures
00:05:13,00:05:16,that were looked at to see whether lip to lip kissing
00:05:16,00:05:16,was a thing.
00:05:16,00:05:17,- But what's a culture?
00:05:17,00:05:19,- As in is Britain one culture?
00:05:19,00:05:21,"- No, no, no, it's not like Britain."
00:05:21,00:05:23,It's obviously tiny minorities of people
00:05:23,00:05:25,'cause the vast majority of people on earth do kiss now
00:05:25,00:05:27,because we're a globalized society.
00:05:27,00:05:29,But if you go to an Amazonian tribe
00:05:29,00:05:31,or Papua New Guinea or something.
00:05:31,00:05:32,"- Yeah, right."
00:05:32,00:05:34,- I think it's particularly uncommon
00:05:34,00:05:36,"in parts of China, parts of Mongolia."
00:05:36,00:05:38,That area is quite uncommon.
00:05:38,00:05:41,- So it was 168 cultures from around the world.
00:05:41,00:05:42,This was a professor of anthropology
00:05:42,00:05:45,"at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas,"
00:05:45,00:05:47,which I assume is a serious university.
00:05:47,00:05:50,- I just associated it with gambling.
00:05:50,00:05:51,I don't know why.
00:05:51,00:05:53,"- Las Vegas, it does do all the stuff."
00:05:53,00:05:54,- That university is a very wealthy one actually
00:05:54,00:05:56,"'cause one year, a few decades ago,"
00:05:56,00:05:57,they put everything on red.
00:05:57,00:05:59,"And yeah, I could use it out now."
00:05:59,00:06:01,- The first person who kind of observed
00:06:01,00:06:04,that a lot of these cultures don't do mouth to mouth kissing
00:06:04,00:06:07,was a guy called Paul Denjoy.
00:06:07,00:06:10,So it's de-apostrophe and then enjoy.
00:06:10,00:06:11,- Don't enjoy.
00:06:11,00:06:12,- Don't enjoy.
00:06:12,00:06:13,- It's such a good name.
00:06:13,00:06:15,He said that some people considered it an abomination
00:06:15,00:06:17,and a form of cannibalism.
00:06:17,00:06:18,"- Oh, come on."
00:06:18,00:06:19,That's someone kissing too hard.
00:06:19,00:06:21,"- It's a step on the road,"
00:06:21,00:06:22,it's a step on the road to cannibalism.
00:06:22,00:06:23,It's a slippery slope.
00:06:23,00:06:25,- So just back to Imogen very quickly.
00:06:25,00:06:28,I read a lot of newspaper articles about her
00:06:28,00:06:31,"because in 1910 and 1911, she was everywhere."
00:06:31,00:06:33,"Obviously, the newspapers saw this story"
00:06:33,00:06:35,that they're trying to ban kissing and they loved it.
00:06:35,00:06:40,She was known as the foe of oculation in the press.
00:06:40,00:06:42,Oculation being another word for kissing.
00:06:42,00:06:45,"And in August of 1910,"
00:06:45,00:06:48,"she tried to organize a no kiss August,"
00:06:48,00:06:51,"which you know, it's like, no drink January"
00:06:51,00:06:53,or whatever they call it in November.
00:06:53,00:06:55,I reckon this might be the first of those.
00:06:55,00:06:58,"In 1910, it must be early."
00:06:58,00:07:01,"But then by 1912, there were no more mentions"
00:07:01,00:07:02,of her on newspapers.com.
00:07:02,00:07:06,"So after two years, the press weren't interested anymore."
00:07:06,00:07:07,- Do we know any more about her story at all?
00:07:07,00:07:09,"Like, do we know when she died or?"
00:07:09,00:07:12,- I know when someone with her name died.
00:07:12,00:07:14,"Well, I couldn't tell if it was definitely her."
00:07:14,00:07:15,"So, I'm not really sure."
00:07:15,00:07:16,She kind of went away after that.
00:07:16,00:07:18,- Two hemorrhageans.
00:07:18,00:07:20,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:07:20,00:07:24,"- 13% of people, so they've been accidentally"
00:07:24,00:07:25,kissed on the mouth at work.
00:07:25,00:07:27,- How does that?
00:07:27,00:07:29,"- Dan says, ""Oh, yeah."""
00:07:29,00:07:32,Dan gets around kissing people on the mouth all the time.
00:07:32,00:07:35,- Sometimes the turn comes too sharply.
00:07:35,00:07:36,"- An air kiss, to another air kiss."
00:07:36,00:07:38,- Especially when you're doing seven.
00:07:38,00:07:42,- I found someone else who has an anti-kissing rule.
00:07:42,00:07:43,"- Oh, yeah? - Oh, yeah."
00:07:43,00:07:46,- And it's Champion Whistlers.
00:07:46,00:07:49,"Specifically one Champion Whistler,"
00:07:49,00:07:51,"who's a guy called Christopher Ullman,"
00:07:51,00:07:55,who I think has won at the International Whistlers Convention.
00:07:55,00:07:57,And there are lots of different kinds of whistling.
00:07:57,00:07:59,And he says he has a no-kissing rule
00:07:59,00:08:00,for 24 hours before a performance.
00:08:00,00:08:01,- Interesting.
00:08:01,00:08:04,"- Well, he must have a lot of whistling groupies."
00:08:04,00:08:06,"- Yeah, he sounds great."
00:08:06,00:08:09,He says it makes your lips mushy kissing before a performance.
00:08:09,00:08:11,"So he doesn't lick his lips,"
00:08:11,00:08:12,which I'm very impressed by.
00:08:12,00:08:13,"- God, that's amazing."
00:08:13,00:08:15,"Now, they must be dry, parched, and dry"
00:08:15,00:08:16,by the time he's whistling.
00:08:16,00:08:19,"- But then they must be like a solid whistle, right?"
00:08:19,00:08:20,- Have you got dry lips?
00:08:20,00:08:21,"I think it's very hard to whistle, isn't it?"
00:08:21,00:08:22,- Is it?
00:08:22,00:08:24,"What does he say, Andy?"
00:08:24,00:08:26,- I don't actually know how he moises them.
00:08:26,00:08:28,"I've only got other details,"
00:08:28,00:08:32,"like he can do Mozart's oboe concerto, the oboe part,"
00:08:32,00:08:34,"but whistling, which is hard."
00:08:34,00:08:35,"- I think most people can do any part, right?"
00:08:35,00:08:37,"- Yeah, most people can whistle any tune."
00:08:37,00:08:39,"- If it's a tune, it's whistleable."
00:08:39,00:08:41,- The problem is none of us knows Mozart's oboe concerto.
00:08:41,00:08:43,"- That piece, that's a good point."
00:08:43,00:08:43,That's a very good point.
00:08:43,00:08:45,"- So when his stooge in the crowd goes,"
00:08:45,00:08:47,I bet no one here can do that.
00:08:47,00:08:48,(all laughing)
00:08:48,00:08:49,"- And then he does it and everyone's like,"
00:08:49,00:08:52,"is that that, is that that?"
00:08:52,00:08:55,"- Better to do a plane engine though, or a drill,"
00:08:55,00:08:59,"or, you know, something that doesn't sound like a whistle."
00:08:59,00:09:00,- Yeah.
00:09:00,00:09:01,- Exactly.
00:09:01,00:09:03,"- What would the point, what was that?"
00:09:03,00:09:03,- It was a drill.
00:09:03,00:09:05,- That was Beethoven's.
00:09:05,00:09:07,(all laughing)
00:09:07,00:09:08,"- All right, well, we're just currently driven"
00:09:08,00:09:09,by this guy's whole career.
00:09:09,00:09:11,"- No, but it's interesting because I, you know, how would you..."
00:09:11,00:09:13,- It can't be his career.
00:09:13,00:09:14,(all laughing)
00:09:14,00:09:15,- It's unclear.
00:09:15,00:09:16,It's unclear.
00:09:16,00:09:17,(all laughing)
00:09:17,00:09:18,"- I know he's got all these groupies,"
00:09:18,00:09:20,"but really, you make it looking out for."
00:09:20,00:09:21,"- They asked him, in this interview,"
00:09:21,00:09:23,"if his family gets sick of the whistling,"
00:09:23,00:09:24,"and he said, ""I actually don't whistle"
00:09:24,00:09:25,"""around the house very much."
00:09:25,00:09:29,"""Random, idle whistling is very annoying."""
00:09:29,00:09:32,"- Well, that's, someone's told him that a lot of times."
00:09:32,00:09:35,"In 1921, in the newspapers,"
00:09:35,00:09:38,there was a worry about people kissing freckled girls
00:09:38,00:09:40,on the cheeks.
00:09:40,00:09:43,Can you guess why that might be dangerous?
00:09:43,00:09:44,This was in the newspapers.
00:09:44,00:09:47,"- Freckles come off, they go on your lips."
00:09:47,00:09:49,"You get a lip covered in freckles, can't eat you stuff."
00:09:49,00:09:52,"- Or would they thought to be contagious, I guess, is the..."
00:09:52,00:09:52,- Freckles?
00:09:52,00:09:54,"- Yeah, in the 1920s."
00:09:54,00:09:55,(all laughing)
00:09:55,00:09:57,"- Was this a justified thing, or was it a great..."
00:09:57,00:09:59,"Okay, so it's justified."
00:09:59,00:10:00,Freckled girls.
00:10:00,00:10:03,"- Because, because, because they are out in the sun,"
00:10:03,00:10:05,"so they are wearing what, back in the 1920s,"
00:10:05,00:10:07,was radioactive sunscreen.
00:10:07,00:10:08,- You're so close.
00:10:08,00:10:10,"- Yeah, so the sunscreen had chemicals in it."
00:10:10,00:10:11,"- No, no, don't carry on with the wrong answer."
00:10:11,00:10:12,"- Okay, okay, just try..."
00:10:12,00:10:15,"- Radioactive sunscreen, which meant that to kiss them"
00:10:15,00:10:17,"would give radiation, and you'd become..."
00:10:17,00:10:18,"- Yeah, have a radioactive part."
00:10:18,00:10:19,"- Oh, okay."
00:10:19,00:10:20,- It's the being outside part.
00:10:20,00:10:21,- No.
00:10:21,00:10:22,- Poisonous makeup.
00:10:22,00:10:23,- Almost.
00:10:23,00:10:27,"Basically, there was a antifreckle medication"
00:10:27,00:10:29,"that people were using to try and get rid of their freckles,"
00:10:29,00:10:32,and it was toxic if ingested.
00:10:32,00:10:34,"And so there was a danger, according to the newspapers,"
00:10:34,00:10:36,"if you kissed a freckled girl on the cheek,"
00:10:36,00:10:37,you might get sick.
00:10:37,00:10:39,"- Oh, my gosh."
00:10:39,00:10:40,"- That's awful, 'cause the girls are gonna think"
00:10:40,00:10:42,"that their medication isn't working at all,"
00:10:42,00:10:44,'cause still no one's kissing them.
00:10:44,00:10:45,- Yeah.
00:10:45,00:10:46,"- Alternatives to kissing,"
00:10:46,00:10:47,"which people have had to come up with,"
00:10:47,00:10:50,these poor societies that don't have kissing.
00:10:50,00:10:53,"Darwin, who met a lot of people in his life,"
00:10:53,00:10:54,"different peoples,"
00:10:54,00:10:57,"listed a bunch of alternatives to kissing in cultures,"
00:10:57,00:11:00,"and he listed rubbing of noses,"
00:11:00,00:11:03,"like which lapplanders he's known as do,"
00:11:03,00:11:06,"rubbing or patting of the arms, breasts, or stomachs,"
00:11:06,00:11:08,or one man striking his own face
00:11:08,00:11:11,with the hands or feet of another.
00:11:11,00:11:12,"- Like a slap, proper slap."
00:11:12,00:11:13,"- It's like, why are you hitting yourself?"
00:11:13,00:11:14,Why are you hitting yourself?
00:11:14,00:11:16,"- Oh, right."
00:11:16,00:11:17,"- Well, actually, it's not you hitting yourself,"
00:11:17,00:11:19,it's me grabbing your hand
00:11:19,00:11:21,and then hitting me in the face with your hand.
00:11:21,00:11:23,"- You are actually hitting yourself, yeah."
00:11:23,00:11:24,- Why are you hitting me?
00:11:24,00:11:25,Why are you hitting me?
00:11:25,00:11:26,"- Yeah, why are you hitting me?"
00:11:26,00:11:27,- Was that a game?
00:11:27,00:11:27,Why are you hitting me?
00:11:27,00:11:28,(laughing)
00:11:28,00:11:31,"- It was a cat phrase, you could say, yeah, yeah."
00:11:31,00:11:32,- Can I talk about very quickly
00:11:32,00:11:34,some other public health stuff?
00:11:34,00:11:34,- Yeah.
00:11:34,00:11:37,- Especially done by American women.
00:11:37,00:11:40,So this is a group of middle-class women from Manhattan
00:11:40,00:11:43,called the Ladies Health Protective Association.
00:11:43,00:11:47,"And they, basically, there was a huge pile of manure"
00:11:47,00:11:50,"in the middle of New York, okay?"
00:11:50,00:11:54,They covered two blocks and stood 30 feet tall.
00:11:54,00:11:57,- I was picturing much smaller when you said there was a pile.
00:11:57,00:11:58,(laughing)
00:11:58,00:11:59,- That's incredible.
00:11:59,00:11:59,- Like the Godzilla.
00:11:59,00:12:01,"- So what they would do is, obviously,"
00:12:01,00:12:02,"a lot of horses in those days, right?"
00:12:02,00:12:05,They would collect the manure from stables
00:12:05,00:12:07,and they would sell it as fertilizer to farmers
00:12:07,00:12:08,"who were just outside the city,"
00:12:08,00:12:09,but they needed someone to keep it
00:12:09,00:12:12,and so they just kept it in the middle of the street.
00:12:12,00:12:13,"It was this guy called, weirdly enough,"
00:12:13,00:12:15,he was called Michael Caine.
00:12:15,00:12:17,(laughing)
00:12:17,00:12:20,"But Caine, as in Harry Caine, with a K."
00:12:20,00:12:23,"But anyway, Michael Caine had this huge manure pile"
00:12:23,00:12:25,and he was making loads of money.
00:12:25,00:12:27,"He was making $300,000 a year,"
00:12:27,00:12:30,which today is about $8 million from this manure pile.
00:12:30,00:12:32,"And his brother-in-law was a New York state senator,"
00:12:32,00:12:33,so everyone thought there was nothing
00:12:33,00:12:35,they could do about it.
00:12:35,00:12:37,"Anyway, this Ladies Health Protective Association"
00:12:37,00:12:39,came along and did a court case
00:12:39,00:12:42,"and amazingly, they won it."
00:12:42,00:12:43,They basically called it a nuisance
00:12:43,00:12:46,"and by the law, there was no way that he could get around it"
00:12:46,00:12:49,because of this technical thing they called it.
00:12:49,00:12:51,"And not only that, the Board of Health denied any permits"
00:12:51,00:12:53,for any manure dumps in the whole city.
00:12:53,00:12:55,"So that's why, if you go to New York now,"
00:12:55,00:12:57,there's not a 30-foot pile.
00:12:57,00:13:01,- I've always wondered why there's not a 30-foot pile.
00:13:01,00:13:03,- And this group then turned to spitting.
00:13:03,00:13:06,"Sorry, they turned to stop spitting, okay."
00:13:06,00:13:09,And that was when New York became the first city
00:13:09,00:13:11,in the world that banned spitting.
00:13:11,00:13:13,"- Isn't it true that in the middle of the Central Park,"
00:13:13,00:13:17,there was a massive reservoir of spit?
00:13:17,00:13:18,- Disgusting.
00:13:18,00:13:20,"- Okay, on with the podcast."
00:13:20,00:13:23,(upbeat music)
00:13:23,00:13:27,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two"
00:13:27,00:13:29,and that is Andy.
00:13:29,00:13:33,"- My fact is that after King Charles I was decapitated,"
00:13:33,00:13:35,he was recapitated.
00:13:35,00:13:37,"- Oh, you just made that word up."
00:13:37,00:13:39,"- Yeah, so King Charles I,"
00:13:39,00:13:43,"only King who's ever been executed,"
00:13:43,00:13:44,I guess loads of them have been killed in battles
00:13:44,00:13:46,and things like that.
00:13:46,00:13:49,But it was in 1649 and it was just after the English Civil War
00:13:49,00:13:53,"and obviously huge move, you know, big old move."
00:13:53,00:13:54,- Big deal.
00:13:54,00:13:55,"- Political chaos, yeah."
00:13:55,00:13:57,But the King's body basically had to be seen
00:13:57,00:14:00,"and the authorities, the sort of Republican authorities"
00:14:00,00:14:04,"wanted to say, look, he's definitely dead"
00:14:04,00:14:05,and he's not coming back.
00:14:05,00:14:09,So they employed a surgeon after the execution
00:14:09,00:14:11,to stitch the head back on.
00:14:11,00:14:13,- I would have thought that if I'd have seen
00:14:13,00:14:14,"his body without the head,"
00:14:14,00:14:16,that would be even more proof that he wasn't alive.
00:14:16,00:14:17,- That's a good point.
00:14:17,00:14:19,- It sort of looks like he was kind of coming back
00:14:19,00:14:22,in the head that's meant to be off with suddenly back on.
00:14:22,00:14:23,"- Anyway, I should say quickly where I got this from,"
00:14:23,00:14:25,I've been reading a book.
00:14:25,00:14:25,It's actually from a novel.
00:14:25,00:14:27,"It's called ""Act of Oblivion"""
00:14:27,00:14:30,and it's all about the hunt for the regicides.
00:14:30,00:14:31,- Is it by Thomas Harris?
00:14:31,00:14:32,"- No, by Robert Harris."
00:14:32,00:14:33,"- Robert Harris, yeah, yeah."
00:14:33,00:14:36,"- So basically, and it describes in incredibly gory detail"
00:14:36,00:14:39,the death of the King and also the death of the regicides
00:14:39,00:14:41,who the people who signed the death warrant and all this
00:14:41,00:14:44,"and who really, they really put through the ringer."
00:14:44,00:14:46,"- Yeah, this is, we should say for internationalists,"
00:14:46,00:14:47,they didn't put them through the ringer
00:14:47,00:14:48,as soon as they'd killed the King.
00:14:48,00:14:49,It wasn't like you've executed the King
00:14:49,00:14:50,and now we're gonna execute you.
00:14:50,00:14:51,It was when the restoration happened.
00:14:51,00:14:53,So there was a brief period
00:14:53,00:14:55,where everyone was pro-killing the monarchy.
00:14:55,00:14:59,"And then sadly, yeah, after a decade, monarchy came back"
00:14:59,00:15:01,and then all the regicides got hunted down sadly.
00:15:01,00:15:04,"- Sadly, Aniseh, sadly monarchy came back."
00:15:04,00:15:05,"- From the perspective of a round head,"
00:15:05,00:15:08,I was adopting the character of Oliver Cromwell.
00:15:08,00:15:10,- So I didn't know anything about Charles the First
00:15:10,00:15:12,having not grown up in this country.
00:15:12,00:15:14,"So I am one of these foreign listeners, as it were,"
00:15:14,00:15:15,"that you mentioned, Anna."
00:15:15,00:15:18,And it struck me that what a big deal it was
00:15:18,00:15:21,to kill the King off the back of a trial.
00:15:21,00:15:22,'Cause there's all this stuff.
00:15:22,00:15:23,And Oliver Cromwell is a name
00:15:23,00:15:26,that is very much part of the decision
00:15:26,00:15:28,to bring him to trial and have him execute.
00:15:28,00:15:29,- A key player.
00:15:29,00:15:32,- And the story gets quite gruesome
00:15:32,00:15:34,when we talk about what happened to him and the others
00:15:34,00:15:37,some 30 years later after the death.
00:15:37,00:15:37,- Only 10 years later.
00:15:37,00:15:38,"- Sorry, 10 years later."
00:15:38,00:15:41,"- Okay, so 1649, Charles was killed."
00:15:41,00:15:43,"And then recapitated, right?"
00:15:43,00:15:46,"1650, I think it was eight, Oliver Cromwell died"
00:15:46,00:15:48,after less than 10 years in office.
00:15:48,00:15:51,"And then two years later, the monarchy is restored, 1660."
00:15:51,00:15:55,"Then at that point, Oliver Cromwell is dug up"
00:15:55,00:15:57,and decapitated.
00:15:57,00:16:02,So both Charles and Cromwell had a head-altering situation.
00:16:02,00:16:03,- They should have switched the rounds.
00:16:03,00:16:05,It was freaking Friday.
00:16:05,00:16:06,- Freaking Friday.
00:16:06,00:16:09,"- It was his son, was it King Charles II,"
00:16:09,00:16:11,"who was a direct son of Charles I,"
00:16:11,00:16:15,who then was the person in charge of the monarchy once?
00:16:15,00:16:17,- The person in charge of the monarchy or the king?
00:16:17,00:16:18,(all laughing)
00:16:18,00:16:20,"- Well, that's surprising that it disappeared for 11 years."
00:16:20,00:16:23,"I mean, that is a pretty big deal."
00:16:23,00:16:25,"It wasn't just overthrowing the monarchy,"
00:16:25,00:16:27,it was overthrowing all of the monarchy.
00:16:27,00:16:28,- It was the other deal.
00:16:28,00:16:29,- It was one of the biggest things
00:16:29,00:16:30,that's ever happened in England's history.
00:16:30,00:16:31,"- I was just saying, as a foreigner,"
00:16:31,00:16:33,"you don't follow, sorry, good up to date"
00:16:33,00:16:34,on Charles the first.
00:16:34,00:16:36,- You have lived here for about 20 years now.
00:16:36,00:16:38,I feel like you should have some point.
00:16:38,00:16:40,"- Yeah, it should have been as I was coming to immigration."
00:16:40,00:16:42,- Did you not have to do an exam to get into the UK?
00:16:42,00:16:43,"- No, a British."
00:16:43,00:16:45,"- Well, do you want to know something really interesting?"
00:16:45,00:16:48,"It's not in a lot of the citizenship tests,"
00:16:48,00:16:49,"or at least a couple of years ago,"
00:16:49,00:16:50,there was a really good article on--
00:16:50,00:16:52,- Maybe question number one.
00:16:52,00:16:54,(laughing)
00:16:54,00:16:56,- There was a really good article on history today
00:16:56,00:17:00,about how it wasn't in the test for new immigrants.
00:17:00,00:17:01,"There was nothing about the civil war,"
00:17:01,00:17:03,"anything like that, and missed that whole period."
00:17:03,00:17:06,"And someone asked immigration,"
00:17:06,00:17:08,why isn't this included?
00:17:08,00:17:11,And they said the wounds are still too fresh.
00:17:11,00:17:13,"So I spoke first and said,"
00:17:13,00:17:15,the assumption is that we are all anti-cromwell.
00:17:15,00:17:17,"Obviously parliamentarian,"
00:17:17,00:17:18,didn't believe in the divine right of kings.
00:17:18,00:17:20,The reason that Charles the first was overthrown
00:17:20,00:17:22,was because he really went hard
00:17:22,00:17:23,on the divine right of kings as well.
00:17:23,00:17:24,"He loved it, didn't he?"
00:17:24,00:17:26,"Like he prorogued parliament for 11 years,"
00:17:26,00:17:27,"didn't want to ask them anything,"
00:17:27,00:17:29,and then told them to give him loads of money.
00:17:29,00:17:31,He was into absolutist monarchy.
00:17:31,00:17:32,"- And when they put him on trial,"
00:17:32,00:17:33,"he was like, well, you can't put me on trial"
00:17:33,00:17:35,"because God put me here, so."
00:17:35,00:17:36,- Yeah.
00:17:36,00:17:38,And now I think Cromwell is a bit of a villain
00:17:38,00:17:39,to almost everyone.
00:17:39,00:17:42,"But in another country, he would be a hero."
00:17:42,00:17:44,"And in fact, in America, he's remembered quite heroically."
00:17:44,00:17:46,- He's still got a statue outside of parliament.
00:17:46,00:17:48,"- Yeah, which is surprising."
00:17:48,00:17:49,"So he's not, yeah, and that wasn't toppled"
00:17:49,00:17:51,in the old topples of statues period
00:17:51,00:17:53,that we went through quite recently.
00:17:53,00:17:54,"- No, it wouldn't be."
00:17:54,00:17:57,"- After he died, his, or rather after he died,"
00:17:57,00:18:01,was dug up and then posthumously re-executed.
00:18:01,00:18:02,"His body and a couple of comrades,"
00:18:02,00:18:03,"they were hanged, beheaded,"
00:18:03,00:18:05,and then the heads were placed on spikes.
00:18:05,00:18:08,His head stayed on a spike for 25 years.
00:18:08,00:18:10,- That is the most amazing.
00:18:10,00:18:11,"For me, the most amazing thing about this whole thing."
00:18:11,00:18:12,- It's a long time.
00:18:12,00:18:14,"- But for 25 years, whenever you came to London,"
00:18:14,00:18:16,you could go and look at a head on the spike.
00:18:16,00:18:19,"And if you came back 25 years later, it would still be there."
00:18:19,00:18:20,- It's amazing.
00:18:20,00:18:21,- It's amazing.
00:18:21,00:18:23,"Like, I think about all the shops near my house."
00:18:23,00:18:26,Most of them are less than five years old
00:18:26,00:18:27,'cause they just all got-
00:18:27,00:18:28,- The turnover.
00:18:28,00:18:29,- Yeah.
00:18:29,00:18:29,- It was much less than those days.
00:18:29,00:18:31,You got a lot of custom in the same place for a head.
00:18:31,00:18:32,- Amazing.
00:18:32,00:18:34,- But one person who lived through the whole thing
00:18:34,00:18:37,"was Oliver Cromwell's son, Richard."
00:18:37,00:18:40,"So when Cromwell died, he happened so often"
00:18:40,00:18:44,"with rulers, tyrants, newly established raids."
00:18:44,00:18:46,"Anyway, they try and hand over to their kids."
00:18:46,00:18:48,- So let's get rid of the monarchy.
00:18:48,00:18:50,It's ridiculous that someone could have the divine right
00:18:50,00:18:52,"to rule, but when I die, I want my kids to have it."
00:18:52,00:18:54,- I actually do think Napoleon too
00:18:54,00:18:56,is a good name for an emperor.
00:18:56,00:18:59,"So, and anyway, so Richard Cromwell resigned."
00:18:59,00:19:01,He was not up to the job.
00:19:01,00:19:05,"I mean, he was not, you know, as zealous as his father"
00:19:05,00:19:06,and he didn't have the authority.
00:19:06,00:19:09,"So he was kicked out in 1659, one year later,"
00:19:09,00:19:11,and he just lived out his life.
00:19:11,00:19:13,He died in 1712.
00:19:13,00:19:14,I think he moved overseas.
00:19:14,00:19:16,- I think if your dad's head was on the spike
00:19:16,00:19:18,"in London, you probably would move out of town."
00:19:18,00:19:20,"- You wouldn't say in London, would you?"
00:19:20,00:19:23,"- But get this, he died in 1712."
00:19:23,00:19:24,He lived an incredibly long time.
00:19:24,00:19:27,So he saw the whole thing and he was the longest-lived
00:19:27,00:19:30,British head of state until the year 2012
00:19:30,00:19:34,when he was overtaken by Queen Elizabeth the second prime.
00:19:34,00:19:35,When she was 85.
00:19:35,00:19:36,So that's the age he lived to.
00:19:36,00:19:38,"So for a long time, the longest-lived head of state"
00:19:38,00:19:39,was Richard Cromwell.
00:19:39,00:19:41,- That's really funny.
00:19:41,00:19:43,- Do you know where Oliver Cromwell's head is now?
00:19:43,00:19:46,"- Oh, was it reburied with the rest of him?"
00:19:46,00:19:50,"- No, it was buried in Cambridge University now."
00:19:50,00:19:53,"- Okay, so I read this in a Giles Brandrith book"
00:19:53,00:19:55,and I tweeted him to ask him if this was true
00:19:55,00:19:56,and he tweeted me back.
00:19:56,00:19:58,"So I said, ""My memory of it goes like this."
00:19:58,00:20:00,"""There is a relic of Oliver Cromwell"
00:20:00,00:20:02,"""kept by the chief whip or prime minister."
00:20:02,00:20:04,"""Have I made that up?"""
00:20:04,00:20:04,I probably have.
00:20:04,00:20:07,"He wrote back, ""It's in the drawers at Checkers."""
00:20:07,00:20:09,So my memory is that the skull of--
00:20:09,00:20:10,- The skull of Oliver Cromwell is in Checkers.
00:20:10,00:20:11,- Is in a drawer.
00:20:11,00:20:12,- In a drawer.
00:20:12,00:20:17,"- And I think I've read it in Brandrith's autobiography,"
00:20:17,00:20:20,his diaries of his time as a politician.
00:20:20,00:20:23,And in it he says he goes to Checkers and the drawers open
00:20:23,00:20:25,and they let you see and stroke the skull.
00:20:25,00:20:26,- Stroke the skull.
00:20:26,00:20:30,- So what I have in my notes is that one day
00:20:30,00:20:32,there was a storm and the head blew off the spike
00:20:32,00:20:33,"and they thought, ""You know what?"
00:20:33,00:20:35,"""It's been here for 25 years."
00:20:35,00:20:37,"""We probably don't need to put it back up again."
00:20:37,00:20:38,"""Everyone's seen it now."""
00:20:38,00:20:39,- They get the idea.
00:20:39,00:20:40,"- Yeah, they get it again."
00:20:40,00:20:40,- Exactly.
00:20:40,00:20:43,- And then the skull was sort of taken away
00:20:43,00:20:46,and it was just kind of sold in auction after auction
00:20:46,00:20:48,and went through a load of families.
00:20:48,00:20:51,"But then it was buried at Sydney Sussex College,"
00:20:51,00:20:52,Cambridge in 1960.
00:20:52,00:20:53,- Interesting.
00:20:53,00:20:54,- That's what I've got.
00:20:54,00:20:56,"But I mean, probably like with these things,"
00:20:56,00:20:58,there's probably 20 of those skulls around there.
00:20:58,00:21:00,"- Yeah, and I don't specify what relic I mean."
00:21:00,00:21:02,He could have thought it might have been a finger
00:21:02,00:21:03,or something in my head.
00:21:03,00:21:04,It's his head.
00:21:04,00:21:05,"- Oh well, maybe it's not the head."
00:21:05,00:21:06,That's more normal if it's a finger.
00:21:06,00:21:09,'Cause I can't think of a drawer that could even fit a skull.
00:21:09,00:21:11,"- Oh, I think you can't think of a drawer that could fit a skull."
00:21:11,00:21:12,- I can't imagine.
00:21:12,00:21:14,- Are you gonna pull out of that?
00:21:14,00:21:15,- I should pull out of that.
00:21:15,00:21:17,I suppose I'm imagining a desk drawer
00:21:17,00:21:19,and there's old desks and tiny drawers.
00:21:19,00:21:20,"- The bottom drawer,"
00:21:20,00:21:23,universe standard wooden desk will be a bit bigger.
00:21:23,00:21:25,"- But even if that didn't exist,"
00:21:25,00:21:28,it doesn't take much imagination to take a drawer
00:21:28,00:21:28,and make it slightly deeper.
00:21:28,00:21:31,"- My head, ironically, my head is not big enough"
00:21:31,00:21:33,to get around this concept.
00:21:33,00:21:38,- Have you ever seen a filing cabinet because...
00:21:38,00:21:39,"- Oh, no, don't."
00:21:39,00:21:39,It's too much.
00:21:39,00:21:40,- You're gonna flip your lid.
00:21:40,00:21:42,- I can't take it.
00:21:42,00:21:44,"So Anna's amazing Freaky Friday idea,"
00:21:44,00:21:46,which I actually think is a brilliant idea.
00:21:46,00:21:47,- Thank you.
00:21:47,00:21:49,- Maybe could have been truish
00:21:49,00:21:52,"because when Cromwell's head got put on the spike,"
00:21:52,00:21:56,there was a big rumour around that actually it wasn't his head
00:21:56,00:21:58,and that they'd mistakenly got on the wrong one
00:21:58,00:22:02,and it was probably some old King of England.
00:22:02,00:22:03,They didn't specify which one it was.
00:22:03,00:22:06,"'Cause it was, he was originally buried."
00:22:06,00:22:07,"Was it in Westminster Abbey, I think?"
00:22:07,00:22:08,"- Right, yeah."
00:22:08,00:22:10,- So there was loads of other Kings there
00:22:10,00:22:12,and they thought that they dug up the wrong thing
00:22:12,00:22:14,and just put an old King's head there.
00:22:14,00:22:16,- Surely you just pick the roundest head.
00:22:16,00:22:17,- Brilliant.
00:22:17,00:22:18,"- Brilliant, yeah."
00:22:18,00:22:19,- Round head joke.
00:22:19,00:22:20,- It's a round head joke.
00:22:20,00:22:21,"- Oh, very nice."
00:22:21,00:22:23,- They did used to toss them in all together a bit.
00:22:23,00:22:24,Like actually there was obviously a conundrum
00:22:24,00:22:25,after Charles was decapitated
00:22:25,00:22:27,because they don't wanna create a martyr of him
00:22:27,00:22:30,by having it either be a big thing bearing him
00:22:30,00:22:31,or not bearing him at all.
00:22:31,00:22:33,So I think they took him away to Windsor
00:22:33,00:22:35,"and they entered him in Henry VIII's tomb, weirdly."
00:22:35,00:22:36,- Wow.
00:22:36,00:22:41,- And then in 1813 they decided to dig him up again.
00:22:41,00:22:42,I think this was to check.
00:22:42,00:22:43,"- Again, again."
00:22:43,00:22:44,"- He was there, again."
00:22:44,00:22:45,"- Right, okay."
00:22:45,00:22:45,- Just the first time again.
00:22:45,00:22:47,"- Oh, okay, sorry, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:22:47,00:22:50,"- And it was George III's physician,"
00:22:50,00:22:54,"Henry Halford, who was kind of leading the exhumation."
00:22:54,00:22:57,And he ended up with Charles's vertebra
00:22:57,00:23:00,and some beard and some of his teeth.
00:23:00,00:23:00,- Beard.
00:23:00,00:23:02,"- Which is, yeah, some beard."
00:23:02,00:23:05,- I'm surprised the beard is still extant
00:23:05,00:23:06,after all that time.
00:23:06,00:23:06,- Yeah.
00:23:06,00:23:07,"- Yeah, that seems weird, doesn't it?"
00:23:07,00:23:08,- From how many years?
00:23:08,00:23:09,"- How many years, did we say?"
00:23:09,00:23:11,"- Yeah, well, this was 1813, so it's 100 years."
00:23:11,00:23:12,- 160 years.
00:23:12,00:23:13,- What?
00:23:13,00:23:15,"- So he says that they went,"
00:23:15,00:23:16,"""Oh, it's not worth opening the coffin again."
00:23:16,00:23:18,"""Do you mind just keeping these?"""
00:23:18,00:23:19,And he kept them.
00:23:19,00:23:21,Other people who were there say that he went in
00:23:21,00:23:24,and nicked all the stuff and hung onto it.
00:23:24,00:23:26,But then his grandson returned it.
00:23:26,00:23:29,It was the 1890s and he went to the Prince of Wales
00:23:29,00:23:30,"and said, ""Well, look, we've got these bits"
00:23:30,00:23:32,"""of Charles I, do you want them?"""
00:23:32,00:23:34,"- The story, the QI facts that we always say"
00:23:34,00:23:38,about this is that they used the vertebrae as a salt holder.
00:23:38,00:23:40,"- Oh, really?"
00:23:40,00:23:41,"- Yeah, so if you ever went for dinner"
00:23:41,00:23:45,"at Sir Henry Hulford's house and you wanted some salt,"
00:23:45,00:23:46,"it would be a little dish,"
00:23:46,00:23:47,"but when you looked at it closely,"
00:23:47,00:23:49,it would be part of his backbone.
00:23:49,00:23:50,"- Wow. - That's,"
00:23:50,00:23:52,and you can fit that in a cupboard.
00:23:52,00:23:54,(all laughing)
00:23:54,00:23:57,- The eventual outcomes for the regicides
00:23:57,00:23:59,"who were the people who'd signed the death warrant,"
00:23:59,00:24:00,"basically, were bad."
00:24:00,00:24:02,So I think a lot of them are disemboweled.
00:24:02,00:24:03,- They're bad.
00:24:03,00:24:04,- They were not good.
00:24:04,00:24:05,- They were courted.
00:24:05,00:24:07,"- They were, yeah, hanged until not quite dead"
00:24:07,00:24:08,and then had the genitals removed
00:24:08,00:24:10,and then were disemboweled.
00:24:10,00:24:11,"- Still alive, still conscious."
00:24:11,00:24:13,"- While still alive, got to the lie."
00:24:13,00:24:16,"But if you got away, then it could be okay."
00:24:16,00:24:20,"And interestingly, if you live in Connecticut near,"
00:24:20,00:24:22,"I think in New Haven,"
00:24:22,00:24:25,"then there are three streets called Dixwell Avenue,"
00:24:25,00:24:27,a Wally Avenue and Goff Street.
00:24:27,00:24:28,- Dixwell.
00:24:28,00:24:29,- Dixwell and Wally.
00:24:29,00:24:30,- Wally.
00:24:30,00:24:30,- And what was the other one?
00:24:30,00:24:32,"- Dixwell, Wally and Goff."
00:24:32,00:24:33,(all laughing)
00:24:33,00:24:37,- They were the worst surveyors that I ever had for life.
00:24:37,00:24:38,- But Wally and Goff are the two
00:24:38,00:24:40,"that are in this book, Active Oblivion."
00:24:40,00:24:41,- Are they?
00:24:41,00:24:42,"- Dixwell was the doubt, apparently."
00:24:42,00:24:44,(all laughing)
00:24:44,00:24:45,"- Well, they all ended up in this place"
00:24:45,00:24:47,"and they liked them so much in America,"
00:24:47,00:24:49,"obviously, 'cause America aren't that pro monarchy,"
00:24:49,00:24:50,that they named these streets after them.
00:24:50,00:24:53,"- Yeah, they were in very, very religious,"
00:24:53,00:24:54,"puritanical communities,"
00:24:54,00:24:56,which were already very uncertain about monarchy
00:24:56,00:24:57,and wanted development.
00:24:57,00:24:58,"- It was kind of the place where they could go,"
00:24:58,00:25:00,"wasn't it, when they were safe?"
00:25:00,00:25:01,There was another place in North America
00:25:01,00:25:03,named after someone connected to this story.
00:25:03,00:25:08,So the wife of Charles I was Henrietta Marie.
00:25:08,00:25:11,She was a French Catholic princess.
00:25:11,00:25:15,"She got married by proxy, which is quite cool."
00:25:15,00:25:19,So Charles I wasn't there when she got married.
00:25:19,00:25:21,"So he had a proxy who was George Villiers,"
00:25:21,00:25:22,"the first Duke of Buckingham,"
00:25:22,00:25:24,but George Villiers wasn't available either.
00:25:24,00:25:28,"So they got another proxie, her name was Charles de Lorraine,"
00:25:28,00:25:31,who was the Duke of Chavres.
00:25:31,00:25:33,"And basically, they got married"
00:25:33,00:25:35,with this guy pretending to be the king.
00:25:35,00:25:36,"And in those days, you could do that."
00:25:36,00:25:37,"- I think we've said before, haven't we?"
00:25:37,00:25:40,"There were various rituals, if you marry a proxie,"
00:25:40,00:25:42,"like you, as the proxy would,"
00:25:42,00:25:44,maybe have to touch the person's thigh.
00:25:44,00:25:45,I think that happened.
00:25:45,00:25:46,- You have to lie in bed and touch the thigh.
00:25:46,00:25:48,- Lie in bed and be witness with them.
00:25:48,00:25:49,"Yeah, yeah."
00:25:49,00:25:53,- So the king only met his wife three months later at Dover.
00:25:53,00:25:56,So they'd been married for three months when he met her.
00:25:56,00:25:57,- That's so funny.
00:25:57,00:26:00,- And one of these areas in North America
00:26:00,00:26:02,where Catholics felt safe where they could go
00:26:02,00:26:04,"was named after Henrietta Marie,"
00:26:04,00:26:09,"and it was Maryland, or Maryland, or Maryland."
00:26:09,00:26:11,"And we always say this name,"
00:26:11,00:26:13,"and we always pronounce it wrong on this podcast,"
00:26:13,00:26:15,and the people of Maryland always write to us.
00:26:15,00:26:17,But now I actually think that because it's named
00:26:17,00:26:21,"after Henrietta Marie, it should be called Marie-Land."
00:26:21,00:26:22,- Yeah.
00:26:22,00:26:23,- So that's why I will be covering it from now on.
00:26:23,00:26:24,"- Excellent, very nice."
00:26:24,00:26:27,"- Especially because she didn't like Mary, actually."
00:26:27,00:26:29,"'Cause she was French, and she was very French."
00:26:29,00:26:30,And she was beginning English.
00:26:30,00:26:32,She didn't like being called Mary.
00:26:32,00:26:34,- So the English used to call her Mary as like a micknail.
00:26:34,00:26:35,"- And she said, no, I'm French."
00:26:35,00:26:36,Mary's not my name.
00:26:36,00:26:38,"I don't even like the name Mary, fair enough."
00:26:38,00:26:41,"Mary is a better name than Mary, I-M-O."
00:26:41,00:26:42,- Can we talk a bit about the execution itself?
00:26:42,00:26:44,"Why is it such an interesting,"
00:26:44,00:26:46,"I mean, what an extraordinary,"
00:26:46,00:26:47,"I mean, one of the weirdest days ever to happen"
00:26:47,00:26:49,"in English history, you know?"
00:26:49,00:26:51,"It was on whiteboard, it was not far from here."
00:26:51,00:26:57,"So when it happened, the executioner had to wear a disguise,"
00:26:59,00:27:00,because the executioner's never been identified for sure.
00:27:00,00:27:02,- Do you not just mean like a hud?
00:27:02,00:27:03,"- No, I don't."
00:27:03,00:27:07,"I mean a wig, a fake beard, a sailor's costume."
00:27:07,00:27:08,"- Yeah, confusing details here."
00:27:08,00:27:11,"- I'm clear as to why, and fishnets over the face."
00:27:11,00:27:12,- Okay.
00:27:12,00:27:13,"- So afterwards, after the restoration,"
00:27:13,00:27:16,"there was a big manhunt for who was the exact executioner,"
00:27:16,00:27:17,'cause we're gonna kill him.
00:27:17,00:27:19,- There must have been a lot of sailors
00:27:19,00:27:22,getting rid of their fishnets just in case they can't.
00:27:22,00:27:25,"- Well, the executioner was never properly identified."
00:27:25,00:27:27,"One guy was sentenced to death for it,"
00:27:27,00:27:28,but then the sentence was overturned.
00:27:28,00:27:30,"- And one guy claimed to be,"
00:27:30,00:27:33,and then wrote that they can't remember about that.
00:27:33,00:27:34,- There's a museum in London
00:27:34,00:27:36,"that has a few of these relics from the execution,"
00:27:36,00:27:38,"including a shirt that belonged to Charles the First,"
00:27:38,00:27:39,that they believe.
00:27:39,00:27:42,"You know, they can't actually work out properly,"
00:27:42,00:27:45,"but all his bits of clothing was sort of torn off him,"
00:27:45,00:27:46,and handed round and orchid.
00:27:46,00:27:47,"- That's the museum of London, isn't it?"
00:27:47,00:27:49,"- The museum of London, yeah."
00:27:49,00:27:51,"And among those items, they have a patched leather shoe"
00:27:51,00:27:53,"of a man called John Big,"
00:27:53,00:27:55,and they believe that Big was the executioner.
00:27:55,00:27:57,At least that's one of the theories.
00:27:57,00:27:58,"- Okay, Mr. Big."
00:27:58,00:28:00,"- Mr. Big, yeah."
00:28:00,00:28:03,"- That's what that whole thing, it was an analogy."
00:28:03,00:28:04,"- The Sex and the City character, Mr. Big."
00:28:04,00:28:06,- It was an analogy for the English Civil War.
00:28:06,00:28:08,"- Yeah, that's very interesting."
00:28:08,00:28:09,- Can't believe you didn't see that.
00:28:09,00:28:12,"- So I guess, I guess, what's our name is it, Carrie?"
00:28:12,00:28:13,- Guess it.
00:28:13,00:28:14,"- Carrie Fishnet, Carrie Fishnet."
00:28:14,00:28:16,But they thought that would be too obvious.
00:28:16,00:28:17,- Oh my God.
00:28:17,00:28:18,- I don't think it's Carrie Fishnet.
00:28:18,00:28:19,- Is she called Carrie Bradshaw?
00:28:19,00:28:21,"- Oh, Carrie Fishnet is a different person, isn't it?"
00:28:21,00:28:21,- I think it's Carrie Bradshaw.
00:28:21,00:28:24,"- She called Carrie Bradshaw, well, interestingly,"
00:28:24,00:28:27,John Bradshaw was the parliamentary commissioner
00:28:27,00:28:30,who tried Charles I in Westminster at all.
00:28:30,00:28:30,- You are joking.
00:28:30,00:28:31,- No.
00:28:31,00:28:33,- I can't believe we're actually blowing this shit wide.
00:28:33,00:28:34,(laughing)
00:28:34,00:28:35,- This is huge.
00:28:35,00:28:36,- Bradshaw and Big.
00:28:36,00:28:38,"- If any of us had ever properly watched Sex and the City,"
00:28:38,00:28:40,we'd be all over it right now.
00:28:40,00:28:42,(upbeat music)
00:28:42,00:28:48,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:28:48,00:28:50,and that is Anna.
00:28:50,00:28:52,"- My fact this week is that in World War II,"
00:28:52,00:28:55,"a Finnish soldier got tired in the Arctic,"
00:28:55,00:28:57,"so took the entire platoons,"
00:28:57,00:28:59,"rations of methamphetamine,"
00:28:59,00:29:03,and subsequently skied 400 kilometers to safety.
00:29:03,00:29:04,(laughing)
00:29:04,00:29:05,- It's extraordinary.
00:29:05,00:29:07,- It's the power of uppers.
00:29:07,00:29:09,- It's insane the story.
00:29:09,00:29:11,- It's a really insane story.
00:29:11,00:29:15,"So this is a chap called Aimo Koyvanen,"
00:29:15,00:29:19,and it was a time when Finland was all with the Soviet Union.
00:29:19,00:29:20,It was mid-Second World War.
00:29:20,00:29:22,"Finland was sort of on Germany's side,"
00:29:22,00:29:25,"all with the Soviet Union, and he's fighting"
00:29:25,00:29:29,"in this very cold area with his platoon,"
00:29:29,00:29:31,and he had been tasked with keeping
00:29:31,00:29:36,"his entire group supply of pervitin, which is meth."
00:29:36,00:29:38,"And it was so crucial in the Second World War,"
00:29:38,00:29:39,"everyone was bloody taking it,"
00:29:39,00:29:42,"and he was really, really tired,"
00:29:42,00:29:44,"and I think the Soviets were coming and chasing them,"
00:29:44,00:29:47,and he was told to lead them to make tracks
00:29:47,00:29:49,and lead them away so they could escape.
00:29:49,00:29:51,"And he was at the front,"
00:29:51,00:29:54,"and he said in his memory of it that,"
00:29:54,00:29:55,so plausible.
00:29:55,00:29:57,(laughing)
00:29:57,00:29:58,"He said, especially 'cause first of all he said,"
00:29:58,00:30:00,"I didn't wanna take them 'cause I was kind of against that,"
00:30:00,00:30:02,"I disapproved of drugs, so I tried not to,"
00:30:02,00:30:04,"but then I got so knackered that,"
00:30:04,00:30:06,"look, I just tipped a pill into my hand,"
00:30:06,00:30:08,"what I hoped was a pill, but I was wearing mittens,"
00:30:08,00:30:10,"and so quite a few came out,"
00:30:10,00:30:13,"turns out all 30 of the pills came out,"
00:30:13,00:30:15,and then because he wanted to hide
00:30:15,00:30:17,"what he was doing from his comrades,"
00:30:17,00:30:18,he just ate them all.
00:30:18,00:30:19,(laughing)
00:30:19,00:30:21,"- You're being shot at, it's stressful."
00:30:21,00:30:24,"- I'm just, I'm just gonna have all the tic-tacs basically."
00:30:24,00:30:25,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:30:25,00:30:27,"- If you pour a lot of tic-tacs in your hands,"
00:30:27,00:30:30,"let's say you only want two, but accidentally rive come out,"
00:30:30,00:30:31,you're not gonna put them back in the tic-tac.
00:30:31,00:30:32,- Exactly.
00:30:32,00:30:33,- Especially if you're being shot at.
00:30:33,00:30:34,- You're being shot at.
00:30:34,00:30:37,- As I usually am when I eat tic-tacs.
00:30:37,00:30:39,"- Just drop them in the snow, anything."
00:30:39,00:30:43,"- And then it goes Sonic the Hedgehog, 'cause suddenly,"
00:30:43,00:30:43,"- I don't, I was thinking--"
00:30:43,00:30:44,- He just eats this.
00:30:44,00:30:46,"- I was thinking of Popeye when Popeye had just finished,"
00:30:46,00:30:49,(laughing)
00:30:49,00:30:54,"suddenly turned into a mutant absolute, like, yeah."
00:30:54,00:30:59,"He basically, as it goes, he received the hit in one swoop,"
00:30:59,00:31:02,"and the hit, by the way, lasts for a very long time."
00:31:02,00:31:04,"- When you take a normal amount of meth,"
00:31:04,00:31:06,"it can last a few days, so I think--"
00:31:06,00:31:09,"- He took an OD level of it, is what they say right."
00:31:09,00:31:12,And I figure that the OD level would come to you in one hit.
00:31:12,00:31:14,"This kind of just plays out over a number of days,"
00:31:14,00:31:16,"and he goes speeding away, and they're trying to,"
00:31:16,00:31:18,"they're trying to chase him, and they eventually--"
00:31:18,00:31:20,- He's collected all his rings.
00:31:20,00:31:21,(laughing)
00:31:21,00:31:23,"- And they can't keep up, and the music goes really fast,"
00:31:23,00:31:26,"and they're chasing him still, and he's just going off,"
00:31:26,00:31:28,"and then this is the craziest bit,"
00:31:28,00:31:30,"which presumably you've got more on, Anna,"
00:31:30,00:31:32,"'cause I just couldn't believe it, so I stopped reading."
00:31:32,00:31:33,He blacks out.
00:31:33,00:31:35,(laughing)
00:31:35,00:31:38,"He blacks out, and keeps going."
00:31:38,00:31:41,"- Basically, a few days later, he kind of was like,"
00:31:41,00:31:42,"""Oh, where am I?"""
00:31:42,00:31:43,- Yeah.
00:31:43,00:31:44,- And it turned out they'd been doing that.
00:31:44,00:31:47,(laughing)
00:31:47,00:31:49,- He may have collapsed multiple times on the way.
00:31:49,00:31:51,"Basically, one of the things I found surprising"
00:31:51,00:31:53,"in his account is that he said,"
00:31:53,00:31:55,"""You felt amazing for a bit."""
00:31:55,00:31:56,"Quite a short time, I think,"
00:31:56,00:31:57,"where he'd speed like something, the hedgehog,"
00:31:57,00:32:00,"and then he said, ""Something very unexpected happened."
00:32:00,00:32:01,"""I completely lost the plot"
00:32:01,00:32:03,"""and started hallucinating and collapsing."
00:32:03,00:32:04,"""I would say that's not unexpected"
00:32:04,00:32:07,"""if you have taken 30 pills of Beth."""
00:32:07,00:32:09,"But then, the mystery is what happened"
00:32:09,00:32:11,"to the people with him, and I think,"
00:32:11,00:32:13,'cause what proceeded this was actually
00:32:13,00:32:15,an argument between him and his men.
00:32:15,00:32:17,"And he blacks out, and the next thing he remembers,"
00:32:17,00:32:20,he wakes up and he's completely on his own.
00:32:20,00:32:22,"So, one sort of suspects, they had a chat"
00:32:22,00:32:24,"and said, ""This guy's been so annoying right now."
00:32:24,00:32:26,"""He's a massive liability."""
00:32:26,00:32:28,"- Post-meth, post-him-taking of the pills."
00:32:28,00:32:29,"- Post-meth, yeah."
00:32:29,00:32:31,"Well, they took all his ammunition off him, didn't they?"
00:32:31,00:32:32,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:32:32,00:32:35,"And his food supplies, so he woke up and had nothing."
00:32:35,00:32:37,"- Well, then he started skiing towards,"
00:32:37,00:32:39,he saw some allies in the distance
00:32:39,00:32:40,"and started skiing towards them,"
00:32:40,00:32:42,"much too late, realized he's their Russians."
00:32:42,00:32:43,- Yeah.
00:32:43,00:32:44,- But he's still got the drugs on him.
00:32:44,00:32:48,"- He skis through them and past them, keeps going."
00:32:48,00:32:49,"- He said they were so confused,"
00:32:49,00:32:51,"they just moved, they should have shot him,"
00:32:51,00:32:52,and they just moved their legs out
00:32:52,00:32:53,the way to let him get past.
00:32:53,00:32:56,"- Excuse me, he spent all night"
00:32:56,00:32:57,"trying to get to a distant farm window,"
00:32:57,00:32:59,which turned out to be the North Star.
00:32:59,00:33:02,(laughing)
00:33:02,00:33:03,"- And then, he survived, didn't he,"
00:33:03,00:33:07,"by chewing on some tree, like a cactus-style?"
00:33:07,00:33:10,"- He boiled pine needles at one point,"
00:33:10,00:33:14,"so he still had delicious pine tea, had some pine tea,"
00:33:14,00:33:16,but he was really starving.
00:33:16,00:33:17,It was only at the very end
00:33:17,00:33:20,"where he somehow had found a hut,"
00:33:20,00:33:22,"finally there's cabin in the woods,"
00:33:22,00:33:23,"and first of all, it's so funny."
00:33:23,00:33:25,"He says, ""I lit a fire in the middle of the cabin."""
00:33:25,00:33:27,"It's still clearly high, so didn't know"
00:33:27,00:33:28,"what he was doing, lit a fire in the middle"
00:33:28,00:33:30,"of a wooden cabin, and it just set fire to the cabin."
00:33:30,00:33:32,"And he said, ""I just sat next to the fire"
00:33:32,00:33:35,"""and followed it around as it burned the cabin down,"
00:33:35,00:33:37,"""gradually, the whole cabin collapsed around him."""
00:33:37,00:33:40,"- How many days into the trip,"
00:33:40,00:33:41,and I mean the trip?
00:33:41,00:33:42,"- Well, he just doesn't know."
00:33:42,00:33:44,"I think about five days, but he has no idea."
00:33:44,00:33:46,"He only realized when he came out of it,"
00:33:46,00:33:47,it had been two weeks.
00:33:47,00:33:50,"And yeah, on his last day, he was about to starve to death,"
00:33:50,00:33:53,"and a J flew past, and he whacked it with a ski pole,"
00:33:53,00:33:55,and ate a raw J.
00:33:55,00:33:57,"- Again, not the actions of someone"
00:33:57,00:33:58,who's completely with it.
00:33:58,00:34:02,"I mean, the ability to beat a bird out of the sky is unusual."
00:34:02,00:34:03,"- It was a stick, that's hard though."
00:34:03,00:34:04,- It was a stick.
00:34:04,00:34:06,- Those ski poles are quite thin.
00:34:06,00:34:08,- People don't go on pheasant shoots
00:34:08,00:34:08,"with just a ski pole, do they?"
00:34:08,00:34:11,"- No, they're pros, yeah, yeah."
00:34:11,00:34:12,Was this before or after he got blown up?
00:34:12,00:34:13,Sorry.
00:34:13,00:34:14,- That was after.
00:34:14,00:34:16,"- Oh yeah, that's right."
00:34:16,00:34:18,"- So he was sat on fire, and then he was blown up,"
00:34:18,00:34:19,"and then he had the J, right?"
00:34:19,00:34:20,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:34:20,00:34:23,"'Cause he found another little building,"
00:34:23,00:34:26,"and so it was a German post,"
00:34:26,00:34:27,"but the Germans had retreated from it,"
00:34:27,00:34:30,and they had attached mines to it.
00:34:30,00:34:33,So he basically shredded his entire foot
00:34:33,00:34:35,"in the first explosion,"
00:34:35,00:34:36,"and then he sort of hopped around,"
00:34:36,00:34:40,"and he opened a door, and then that was also mined,"
00:34:40,00:34:43,"and supposedly he came to about, you know,"
00:34:43,00:34:45,"many meters away, he'd been blasted across,"
00:34:45,00:34:47,"but he was still holding the door lock,"
00:34:47,00:34:47,like in a cartoon.
00:34:47,00:34:49,(laughing)
00:34:49,00:34:51,"- Yeah, it's the most extraordinary story."
00:34:51,00:34:52,- Do we think true?
00:34:52,00:34:54,"- I can't imagine any of it's true,"
00:34:54,00:34:57,I think he was sitting at home.
00:34:57,00:34:59,"- Because we knew he was anti-drugs, right?"
00:34:59,00:35:00,Maybe he's come up with all this
00:35:00,00:35:02,of his adult dude drug stuff.
00:35:02,00:35:05,"- Oh, this is like a finished 40s talk to Frank thing."
00:35:05,00:35:06,- Yes.
00:35:06,00:35:08,"- I think we know, 'cause we know from his associates"
00:35:08,00:35:10,"that the first bit happened and the last bit happened,"
00:35:10,00:35:12,but I suppose the only account we have
00:35:12,00:35:14,of the in-between bit is his.
00:35:14,00:35:15,"- With a guy with a lot of drugs in his body,"
00:35:15,00:35:17,that's all we've got.
00:35:17,00:35:18,"- But he must have had a shredded foot, right?"
00:35:18,00:35:19,"- Yeah, yeah, the blown off first."
00:35:19,00:35:20,- And he must have been holding a doorknob.
00:35:20,00:35:22,(laughing)
00:35:22,00:35:25,- Must have had a bloody ski pole with him.
00:35:25,00:35:26,"- Oh, dead Jane."
00:35:26,00:35:27,"- He just kind of looked at all these things,"
00:35:27,00:35:30,"like, right, I'm gonna have to make a story up about these."
00:35:30,00:35:31,"- But anyway, somehow he made it,"
00:35:31,00:35:34,"I mean, eventually he was found by his allies,"
00:35:34,00:35:36,"who were the Germans or the Finnish,"
00:35:36,00:35:39,and taken to hospital and--
00:35:39,00:35:41,- Apparently his heart rate was still 200 beats per minute
00:35:41,00:35:43,"at that stage. - God, it's a lot."
00:35:43,00:35:44,- It's a lot.
00:35:44,00:35:45,- It's incredible he lived.
00:35:45,00:35:46,- It's extraordinary. - And then he drove
00:35:46,00:35:47,"to the ripe old age, you know,"
00:35:47,00:35:50,"who just wore it in the '70s and then, yeah."
00:35:50,00:35:51,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:35:51,00:35:54,"- Anyway, he was mad, but the use of meth was,"
00:35:54,00:35:55,"it was big, wasn't it?"
00:35:55,00:35:57,The Germans were particularly into it.
00:35:57,00:35:58,- Yeah.
00:35:58,00:35:59,- But everyone did it.
00:35:59,00:36:01,"- Well, I was reading you could get these pills"
00:36:01,00:36:04,"called Forced March, which were quite common,"
00:36:04,00:36:05,even like at the start of the 20th century.
00:36:05,00:36:09,So they were a blend of cocaine and caffeine.
00:36:09,00:36:11,"I mean, I don't know why you need a caffeine"
00:36:11,00:36:12,"at the point where you've had all the cocaine,"
00:36:12,00:36:16,"but it was basically, it was sold publicly,"
00:36:16,00:36:17,"it was sold by the Wellcome, actually,"
00:36:17,00:36:20,"or by Burrow's Wellcome, who was one of the Wellcome family."
00:36:20,00:36:20,"- Oh, really?"
00:36:20,00:36:23,"- It was a pharmaceutical family there, yeah."
00:36:23,00:36:23,"- Yeah, they took them to the,"
00:36:23,00:36:26,"on the Antarctic Expeditions, the Forced March."
00:36:26,00:36:28,"- Yeah, cocaine, opium. - Yeah, Scott and Shackleton,"
00:36:28,00:36:29,"but they took specifically Forced March,"
00:36:29,00:36:33,"which I think they've got to market it in a gentle way,"
00:36:33,00:36:34,or maybe that's what you want is Forced March.
00:36:34,00:36:36,"- I think that's what you need in motivation, right?"
00:36:36,00:36:37,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:36:37,00:36:37,- I can't march anymore.
00:36:37,00:36:38,"- Yeah, yeah, right."
00:36:38,00:36:40,- I've had some Forced March.
00:36:40,00:36:41,"And did they use that,"
00:36:41,00:36:42,"'cause they use that, the Germans use that in the war."
00:36:42,00:36:46,"Did the Brits use that as well, and the Allies generally?"
00:36:46,00:36:47,"- I think the Allies,"
00:36:47,00:36:50,"I think there was meth use all around, yeah, yeah."
00:36:50,00:36:52,The meth pills that were synthesized in the 30s.
00:36:52,00:36:54,"- But maybe not for everybody, for people who,"
00:36:54,00:36:55,"I mean, obviously not for everybody,"
00:36:55,00:36:58,"but you know, as in maybe it would be for pilots,"
00:36:58,00:37:00,rather than for standard...
00:37:00,00:37:01,- I think it was pilots to stay awake.
00:37:01,00:37:03,"I think that's why the Allies use it, for sure."
00:37:03,00:37:04,- That's so interesting.
00:37:04,00:37:05,"- So off the back of this,"
00:37:05,00:37:07,I was just looking into supplies
00:37:07,00:37:08,"that you take in the Arctic,"
00:37:08,00:37:11,as in what you have to keep you going.
00:37:11,00:37:17,"And, I mean, it seems like it was either cocaine or biscuits."
00:37:17,00:37:20,"I said, no, it's like..."
00:37:20,00:37:22,"- It sounds like a student's fantasy, doesn't it?"
00:37:22,00:37:23,"- Yeah, you're right."
00:37:23,00:37:24,- What's on offer today?
00:37:24,00:37:25,- Same.
00:37:25,00:37:26,"- So, get this, Captain Scott, right?"
00:37:26,00:37:30,Scott of the Antarctic did loads of expeditions there.
00:37:30,00:37:33,"He took some specially made biscuits,"
00:37:33,00:37:35,"which were glucose enriched,"
00:37:35,00:37:37,and they're made by a firm called Huntley and Palmer.
00:37:37,00:37:41,"But he set off with digestive, rich tea,"
00:37:41,00:37:45,"piti beurre, fancy lunch, ginger nuts,"
00:37:45,00:37:49,as well as emergency Antarctic and small captain biscuits.
00:37:49,00:37:49,"And later in his trip,"
00:37:49,00:37:52,he got resupplied with more biscuits.
00:37:52,00:37:54,- I actually think that they're some of the worst biscuits
00:37:54,00:37:57,"you've just named, like digestives and rich tea."
00:37:57,00:37:58,"Where's the... - Rich tea, ginger nuts."
00:37:58,00:38:00,"- The jammie dodger. - Jammie dodger, come on."
00:38:00,00:38:03,"- Well, tragically, this was a pre-jammie dodger world."
00:38:03,00:38:05,"I mean, maybe he would have made it back if he had to."
00:38:05,00:38:09,"- On the first all-female expedition to the North Pole,"
00:38:09,00:38:13,every woman involved eight four penguins per day.
00:38:13,00:38:13,- Wow.
00:38:13,00:38:15,"- They don't have penguins, do they?"
00:38:15,00:38:17,- They brought penguins from the Antarctic to the Arctic
00:38:17,00:38:19,solely to mince them up and eat them.
00:38:19,00:38:20,"- Yeah, they're cruel,"
00:38:20,00:38:23,and that's why they haven't sent women back to the North Pole.
00:38:23,00:38:25,"This is, of course, biscuit penguins."
00:38:25,00:38:27,They were sponsored by McVitie's.
00:38:27,00:38:31,"And so, McVitie's provided them with the hot nail down number,"
00:38:31,00:38:33,"maybe, but thousands of penguins, I believe,"
00:38:33,00:38:34,and one of the women said they were told
00:38:34,00:38:35,to eat four penguins a day.
00:38:35,00:38:38,"- Interesting, according to the biography,"
00:38:38,00:38:41,Frigid Women by Sue Richards and Victoria Richards.
00:38:41,00:38:42,- That's brilliant.
00:38:42,00:38:44,- So this was two of the women who went on it.
00:38:44,00:38:46,They were given six biscuits per person per day
00:38:46,00:38:48,for the expedition.
00:38:48,00:38:48,"- Oh, really?"
00:38:48,00:38:50,"Maybe the person who I read,"
00:38:50,00:38:52,they got their biscuits nicks before they gave them to her.
00:38:52,00:38:54,"- Yeah, that comes to yet."
00:38:54,00:38:55,"- Interesting, because that many,"
00:38:55,00:38:57,it must have been loads of days they were traveling.
00:38:57,00:38:58,"- It was, it was a relay,"
00:38:58,00:39:01,"so it meant that four women at a time were going,"
00:39:01,00:39:02,"and then they would be airlifted out,"
00:39:02,00:39:03,and the next slot would be airlifted
00:39:03,00:39:05,into wherever they were.
00:39:05,00:39:06,- That's cool.
00:39:06,00:39:07,- Yeah.
00:39:07,00:39:08,- I was thinking you could wear the biscuits
00:39:08,00:39:10,"as a kind of extra layer of warmth,"
00:39:10,00:39:11,but maybe not. - Wear the biscuits?
00:39:11,00:39:12,"- Well, it's like you could make it,"
00:39:12,00:39:14,"'cause they're quite flat, aren't they?"
00:39:14,00:39:16,They're kind of a waistcoat that was lined with penguins.
00:39:16,00:39:18,"- And actually, they're two biscuits,"
00:39:18,00:39:21,and in between there's like a little bit of chocolate
00:39:21,00:39:21,"or something, right?"
00:39:21,00:39:23,"- Well, insulation, I'm thinking."
00:39:23,00:39:24,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:39:24,00:39:25,- It just sounds like you're one of the members on the trip
00:39:25,00:39:27,"who misheard wearing the biscuits,"
00:39:27,00:39:29,and you've emerged covered in penguins.
00:39:29,00:39:30,"- What year was this, by the way?"
00:39:30,00:39:34,"- It was 1997, and so I've got a question for you."
00:39:34,00:39:37,"Remembering that it's 1997, and they're British,"
00:39:37,00:39:39,"and thinking what was happening in 1997 at the time,"
00:39:39,00:39:42,what do you think the newspapers nicknamed them?
00:39:42,00:39:43,- The hand-owners.
00:39:43,00:39:44,- The hand-owners.
00:39:44,00:39:46,- Blair's frozen women.
00:39:46,00:39:48,- Go away from politics.
00:39:48,00:39:51,"- Oh, the spice girls were big."
00:39:51,00:39:51,- Ah.
00:39:51,00:39:52,- And they were in the Arctic.
00:39:52,00:39:53,"- Yeah, so."
00:39:53,00:39:55,"- Cold, frozen spices?"
00:39:55,00:39:56,"- No, no, no."
00:39:56,00:39:59,"- Wait, wait, say it again, say the ingredients."
00:39:59,00:40:00,- The spice girls were big.
00:40:00,00:40:01,- Yep.
00:40:01,00:40:02,"- Girl power, girl power."
00:40:02,00:40:03,- They're going to the North Pole.
00:40:03,00:40:04,What nicknamed them?
00:40:04,00:40:05,"- Girl polar, girl polar."
00:40:05,00:40:07,- Ziggazig Arctic.
00:40:07,00:40:08,- Jesus Christ.
00:40:08,00:40:09,- Girl polar.
00:40:09,00:40:10,- Wanna be the North Poles.
00:40:10,00:40:11,- No.
00:40:11,00:40:14,"- To become, 16 become, no, two."
00:40:14,00:40:17,- Literally everyone listening has got this.
00:40:17,00:40:19,"- Okay, okay, well done everyone."
00:40:19,00:40:21,- What do you get of the Arctic?
00:40:21,00:40:22,- Snow.
00:40:22,00:40:23,- As well as snow.
00:40:23,00:40:24,- Ice.
00:40:24,00:40:24,- Icey spice.
00:40:24,00:40:25,- Ice girls.
00:40:25,00:40:27,- The ice girls.
00:40:27,00:40:28,- Woohoo.
00:40:28,00:40:30,"- Pew, pew, pew."
00:40:30,00:40:31,- Ice one down.
00:40:31,00:40:33,"- Wow, straight away, straight in there."
00:40:33,00:40:35,"- Sonic, Sonic Shriver."
00:40:35,00:40:36,- That's incredible.
00:40:36,00:40:39,- And one of the patrons of the ice girls
00:40:39,00:40:41,"was Dawn French, the comedian."
00:40:41,00:40:42,- Yeah.
00:40:42,00:40:45,- And she told the press that she'd actually made the cut
00:40:45,00:40:49,"to be on the expedition, but she decided to stay at home"
00:40:49,00:40:50,and comfort all the husbands.
00:40:50,00:40:51,(laughing)
00:40:51,00:40:53,"- That's so good, I'm sure you know that."
00:40:53,00:40:56,- One of the husbands dumped his wife while she was out there.
00:40:56,00:40:57,"- Oh, while she was out there?"
00:40:57,00:40:58,- Yeah.
00:40:58,00:40:59,- She's married to Dawn French now.
00:40:59,00:41:00,(laughing)
00:41:00,00:41:01,"- What, was it Lenny Henry?"
00:41:01,00:41:02,"- It was, yeah."
00:41:02,00:41:05,"No, this was Anne who had triplets"
00:41:05,00:41:07,and she'd never had any experience before.
00:41:07,00:41:08,She's this amazing explorer now.
00:41:08,00:41:09,"- And Daniels, yeah."
00:41:09,00:41:11,"- And Daniels, never done anything before."
00:41:11,00:41:13,"But she, when they finished the expedition,"
00:41:13,00:41:15,all the other women had letters from home
00:41:15,00:41:16,and she didn't have one
00:41:16,00:41:18,and it was a sign that her husband had decided to go on.
00:41:18,00:41:19,- Oh my gosh.
00:41:19,00:41:22,- I was talking to you about Rosie Stancer.
00:41:22,00:41:22,- Is she one of the--
00:41:22,00:41:25,"- There's one of the arctic,"
00:41:25,00:41:27,"one of the frigid women, as the book has it."
00:41:27,00:41:28,So she was on it.
00:41:28,00:41:29,"So get this, she's,"
00:41:29,00:41:32,"I think she's quite posh, like her--"
00:41:32,00:41:33,- Ash ice.
00:41:33,00:41:35,"- Posh ice, brilliant."
00:41:35,00:41:36,- Brilliant.
00:41:36,00:41:39,"- So she, like Anne Daniels,"
00:41:39,00:41:40,she went on to do a lot of other expeditions.
00:41:40,00:41:42,"She did one, the Snickers South Pole Solo"
00:41:42,00:41:43,and the Mars North Pole Solo.
00:41:43,00:41:45,So these are all chocolate and biscuit sponsored.
00:41:45,00:41:50,"But her grandfather was also a wannabe, thank you, explorer."
00:41:50,00:41:52,"He was the fourth Earl of Granville, right?"
00:41:52,00:41:54,"And he wanted to be a polar explorer,"
00:41:54,00:41:55,but he was thwarted.
00:41:55,00:41:56,Can you guess why?
00:41:56,00:41:57,It was something about his body.
00:41:57,00:42:00,"- He had a weird sort of inner ear thing,"
00:42:00,00:42:03,"but whenever he wanted to go north, he always went south."
00:42:03,00:42:06,"- That's a very creative one, better than what I've got."
00:42:06,00:42:06,Shall I tell you?
00:42:06,00:42:07,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:42:07,00:42:09,- He was too tall.
00:42:09,00:42:10,- Did he?
00:42:10,00:42:10,- To go on an arctic--
00:42:10,00:42:12,- Could you hit your head on the top of the earth?
00:42:12,00:42:14,(laughing)
00:42:14,00:42:16,- 'Cause he wouldn't fit in the tent.
00:42:16,00:42:17,He was too tall for the tent.
00:42:17,00:42:19,- So his feet would be sticking out.
00:42:19,00:42:20,"- Yeah, and that would obviously kill"
00:42:20,00:42:22,all the men in the tent with the cold.
00:42:22,00:42:25,"- Could he not do like the kind of, the embryo position?"
00:42:25,00:42:26,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:42:26,00:42:29,"- He was, he was, I mean, maybe this was an excuse"
00:42:29,00:42:29,"and it was his personality,"
00:42:29,00:42:33,but he thought he was too tall to fit in the expedition tent.
00:42:33,00:42:35,- I thought he was five foot eight.
00:42:35,00:42:36,"- No, no, too tall."
00:42:36,00:42:38,- Could you get a bigger tent?
00:42:38,00:42:38,- No!
00:42:38,00:42:40,"- No, they don't exist."
00:42:40,00:42:43,"My cob knobs bring something that doesn't exist, mate."
00:42:43,00:42:44,- I can't believe you just called
00:42:44,00:42:45,the feet all possessed in the embryo position.
00:42:45,00:42:46,"- I know, I can't remember."
00:42:46,00:42:47,- The embryo position.
00:42:47,00:42:48,- Yeah.
00:42:48,00:42:48,- We've got a phrase for that.
00:42:48,00:42:51,(laughing)
00:42:51,00:42:52,- So I read a story which is that
00:42:52,00:42:54,"and Daniel's mother triplets,"
00:42:54,00:42:56,one of her things to keep her going
00:42:56,00:43:00,was to just say her kid's names over and over again.
00:43:00,00:43:02,How loud the triplets just repeat their names.
00:43:02,00:43:03,- Baby ice.
00:43:03,00:43:05,(laughing)
00:43:05,00:43:08,- But they had very near death experiences.
00:43:08,00:43:08,It was so hairy.
00:43:08,00:43:09,- Scary ice.
00:43:09,00:43:10,(laughing)
00:43:10,00:43:11,- Jesus.
00:43:11,00:43:12,(laughing)
00:43:12,00:43:13,"- Okay, now we just cross off three."
00:43:13,00:43:15,"We've got two more to get, yeah."
00:43:15,00:43:18,"Done posh, we've done scary, and we've done baby."
00:43:18,00:43:19,So that leaves sporty and ginger.
00:43:19,00:43:20,- Sporty and ginger.
00:43:20,00:43:22,"- Wait, oh they didn't take ginger nuts."
00:43:22,00:43:23,They took the penguins.
00:43:23,00:43:24,- Yeah.
00:43:24,00:43:24,- Damn it.
00:43:24,00:43:25,- They're all sporty.
00:43:25,00:43:26,- Okay.
00:43:26,00:43:27,"- But yeah, the mother daughter,"
00:43:27,00:43:28,"the daughter rung her mom to say,"
00:43:28,00:43:30,"""Hey, I'm doing this Arctic expedition."""
00:43:30,00:43:32,"And the mom says, her daughter invited her,"
00:43:32,00:43:35,"the daughter says, she definitely didn't invite her mom,"
00:43:35,00:43:37,but her mom decided to go.
00:43:37,00:43:39,But they both fell through the ice at one point.
00:43:39,00:43:40,So the Arctic moves.
00:43:40,00:43:42,"They didn't quite realize how much when you're exploring,"
00:43:42,00:43:45,it shifts and moves and the ice was creaking
00:43:45,00:43:48,and they're wearing skis and they both fell through the ice
00:43:48,00:43:50,and had to like swim in the skis.
00:43:50,00:43:51,- What?
00:43:51,00:43:52,"- And she said she just remembered,"
00:43:52,00:43:54,"while also towing these supply wagons,"
00:43:54,00:43:56,they all had a supply wagon they had to tow behind them.
00:43:56,00:43:57,- And they survived?
00:43:57,00:43:58,"- Yeah, they somehow survived."
00:43:58,00:43:59,Incredibly.
00:43:59,00:44:02,But then it sounds like God was watching
00:44:02,00:44:05,"'cause they ended up, two of them ended up"
00:44:05,00:44:07,"managing to climb out onto one side of the ice,"
00:44:07,00:44:09,but their group was on the other.
00:44:09,00:44:11,So they were on either side of a river
00:44:11,00:44:12,and they just walked either side of this river
00:44:12,00:44:14,and they were getting more and more divergent
00:44:14,00:44:15,and they realized they were not gonna be able
00:44:15,00:44:17,to get back to each other.
00:44:17,00:44:20,And then suddenly the ice started moving
00:44:20,00:44:23,and the river closed up and the ice joined together.
00:44:23,00:44:24,- Wow.
00:44:24,00:44:25,- But it would have been very precarious
00:44:25,00:44:27,as in to walk across that is quite nerve wracking.
00:44:27,00:44:28,You would have had to tread.
00:44:28,00:44:32,"You would have had to walk quite gingerly, spice."
00:44:32,00:44:32,"Ice, ice."
00:44:32,00:44:36,James saw that coming from such a distance.
00:44:36,00:44:39,- What's that on the horizon?
00:44:39,00:44:41,Is it the North Pole?
00:44:41,00:44:43,"No, is that these junk?"
00:44:43,00:44:47,"- Oh, it doesn't feel as good when you get there."
00:44:48,00:44:50,(upbeat music)
00:44:50,00:44:56,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show"
00:44:56,00:44:57,and that is my fact.
00:44:57,00:45:01,My fact this week is that the crowd science expert
00:45:01,00:45:04,who designed and mapped out the cue
00:45:04,00:45:07,is called Professor Keith Still.
00:45:07,00:45:10,- Did you try and say keep?
00:45:10,00:45:11,It sounds like keep.
00:45:11,00:45:13,- So his name's Keith Still.
00:45:13,00:45:14,It looks like keep still.
00:45:14,00:45:16,Would you say it in a weird way?
00:45:16,00:45:17,- What's the cues do?
00:45:17,00:45:19,"They moved, I think."
00:45:19,00:45:21,- But this one famously was a very long one
00:45:21,00:45:24,that required you to keep still.
00:45:24,00:45:26,- Actually we tried to keep walking for about five months.
00:45:26,00:45:28,"- It did, but what were you doing when you weren't walking?"
00:45:28,00:45:30,- I suppose you would keep still.
00:45:30,00:45:31,- That's right.
00:45:31,00:45:33,- They always say keep still.
00:45:33,00:45:36,- This is the cue for Elizabeth II.
00:45:36,00:45:37,- This is the passing of the queen.
00:45:37,00:45:39,There was this extraordinary cue
00:45:39,00:45:42,that lasted somewhere between five miles onwards.
00:45:42,00:45:44,"And if you were in it,"
00:45:44,00:45:45,if you were someone who came to London
00:45:45,00:45:46,"to be part of it,"
00:45:46,00:45:48,you could be waiting between nine and 24 hours
00:45:48,00:45:50,to eventually get to the front of the cue.
00:45:50,00:45:54,- Professor Keith Still is someone who helps.
00:45:54,00:45:55,"- You could say his name normally,"
00:45:55,00:45:57,now we've done the facts.
00:45:57,00:45:58,"- We've explained the joke,"
00:45:58,00:45:59,which always works.
00:45:59,00:46:01,Now let's just call him by his name.
00:46:01,00:46:03,- So he is from Burton and Kendall in Cumbria
00:46:03,00:46:06,and his job is a crowd scientist.
00:46:06,00:46:07,"So for the last 30 years,"
00:46:07,00:46:09,he's been doing this as a job
00:46:09,00:46:12,and he was the person who was in charge of creating
00:46:12,00:46:15,a line that was gonna be one that meant
00:46:15,00:46:16,that people felt safe
00:46:16,00:46:18,and that they had toilet stops along the way.
00:46:18,00:46:21,"And he had to, and you know, medical assistants"
00:46:21,00:46:23,and he had to devise it for something
00:46:23,00:46:24,that was twice the length.
00:46:24,00:46:25,- Where would it have come?
00:46:25,00:46:26,- I don't know.
00:46:26,00:46:26,I'm not sure if we were ever--
00:46:26,00:46:27,- Into the English Channel.
00:46:27,00:46:29,When you dropped it into the English Channel.
00:46:29,00:46:31,"- Because they did stop it at one point,"
00:46:31,00:46:32,they said we're at capacity.
00:46:32,00:46:34,So they didn't use the proposed route.
00:46:34,00:46:35,But then what they had was a pen
00:46:35,00:46:37,where a sort of secondary cue started
00:46:37,00:46:39,where you could then go from that second cue.
00:46:39,00:46:40,- Cue for the cue.
00:46:40,00:46:41,"- Cue for the cue, exactly."
00:46:41,00:46:44,"- God, yeah, I remember that happened."
00:46:44,00:46:46,I didn't go clubbing very much as a student.
00:46:46,00:46:48,- You're a stonisher now.
00:46:48,00:46:49,"- No, no, no, it's true."
00:46:49,00:46:51,"But there was, I think partly"
00:46:51,00:46:52,because one of the first times I went--
00:46:52,00:46:56,"- Your friends said you were too tall, didn't they?"
00:46:56,00:46:58,"- Yeah, apparently the club had a very low ceiling."
00:46:58,00:46:59,"- They always do, yeah."
00:46:59,00:47:02,"- Yeah, I would have hated it."
00:47:02,00:47:04,"No, there was a club called The Bridge,"
00:47:04,00:47:05,which was you'd go to.
00:47:05,00:47:09,"And there was a, you'd cue up for ages"
00:47:09,00:47:10,and I did cue up for ages.
00:47:10,00:47:11,"And then you get into, I got in"
00:47:11,00:47:13,and it turned out that the club I got into
00:47:13,00:47:15,was actually a cue for the actual club.
00:47:15,00:47:16,- No.
00:47:16,00:47:17,"- Yeah, there was this whole,"
00:47:17,00:47:18,"and it had a bar and everything,"
00:47:18,00:47:20,but it was basically the cue for The Bridge
00:47:20,00:47:22,as in you get given a ticket
00:47:22,00:47:23,and when they called out certain tickets
00:47:23,00:47:24,you could go into the actual club.
00:47:24,00:47:25,But I cue for about 40 minutes
00:47:25,00:47:27,"to get into the cue club, which was rubbish."
00:47:27,00:47:28,- You must feel like an absolute chump.
00:47:28,00:47:29,I've been to The Bridge multiple times.
00:47:29,00:47:32,I don't remember the old double cue.
00:47:32,00:47:34,"- Oh well, Anna probably walks up to the front"
00:47:34,00:47:35,"and says, ""I'm Anna Szczenski."""
00:47:35,00:47:37,"- Yeah, they let me in the back hugely."
00:47:37,00:47:38,"- And you're DJing, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:47:38,00:47:40,(laughing)
00:47:40,00:47:44,- It is actually quite impressive the level of standing.
00:47:44,00:47:47,So I hadn't really thought about the fact
00:47:47,00:47:49,that you would be actually standing up
00:47:49,00:47:50,"'cause you are constantly moving,"
00:47:50,00:47:51,so you can't really sit down.
00:47:51,00:47:52,You were standing up for 24 hours.
00:47:52,00:47:55,And lots of people needed medical treatment.
00:47:55,00:47:57,291 people needed medical assistance
00:47:57,00:48:00,just on one day with 17 having to go to hospital.
00:48:00,00:48:02,"- No man, it's a lot."
00:48:02,00:48:03,"- Dehydrating and fainting, it is quite a lot."
00:48:03,00:48:05,- Of course they could have just not had a cue.
00:48:05,00:48:07,"I mean, these days we do have systems"
00:48:07,00:48:09,to stop people from having to cue
00:48:09,00:48:11,for miles and miles and miles.
00:48:11,00:48:12,"- What, like booking in?"
00:48:12,00:48:13,"- Yeah, you could have just gone on the website,"
00:48:13,00:48:16,"said, ""I'm gonna come between one o'clock and two o'clock."""
00:48:16,00:48:19,And then the cue would never have gotten longer than an hour.
00:48:19,00:48:20,- Why is the fun in that?
00:48:20,00:48:22,What would the news have done for a week?
00:48:22,00:48:23,"- That's the point, isn't it?"
00:48:23,00:48:25,The point is that it's like this ceremonial thing
00:48:25,00:48:26,"that they wanted to show how much,"
00:48:26,00:48:28,how important it was and stuff.
00:48:28,00:48:29,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:48:29,00:48:31,"- Professor Still, Keith Still."
00:48:31,00:48:34,(laughing)
00:48:34,00:48:37,"He got into queuing, first of all, several decades ago."
00:48:37,00:48:39,He was at a Freddie Mercury gig.
00:48:39,00:48:42,"It was an AIDS awareness gig, and it was at Wembley,"
00:48:42,00:48:43,"and he and his friends, they were stuck in queue for hours,"
00:48:43,00:48:46,and his friends were all quite annoyed.
00:48:46,00:48:48,And he was quite mathematically minded
00:48:48,00:48:50,"and thought, ""Oh, God, this is really interesting, actually."""
00:48:50,00:48:53,"And so he got into queuing, and he then is--"
00:48:53,00:48:55,"- Interestingly, queuing for the Queen."
00:48:55,00:48:56,- Yeah!
00:48:56,00:48:56,(gasping)
00:48:56,00:48:57,- And queuing for Queen.
00:48:57,00:48:59,- Oh my God!
00:48:59,00:49:01,We've blown the shit wide open.
00:49:01,00:49:04,"His next thing he did, he went to Wembley Stadium,"
00:49:04,00:49:07,and he got special permission
00:49:07,00:49:09,"from the whoever's running the grounds,"
00:49:09,00:49:11,"and he would spend his weekends, for ages,"
00:49:11,00:49:15,"sitting above the players' tunnel, watching the crowds."
00:49:15,00:49:16,- Oh!
00:49:16,00:49:18,"The match was going on, but he's not watching it."
00:49:18,00:49:20,- I think he wouldn't have been paying any attention
00:49:20,00:49:20,"to the match, yeah."
00:49:20,00:49:22,"You just see this guy sitting above the, yeah."
00:49:22,00:49:25,"- He can't, he said of the queue,"
00:49:25,00:49:27,"the one, the recent queue,"
00:49:27,00:49:29,he would not have been able to withstand
00:49:29,00:49:31,the length of time it required to get to the front.
00:49:31,00:49:34,He himself can no longer queue within--
00:49:34,00:49:35,- Even queue.
00:49:35,00:49:36,- The queues he decides.
00:49:36,00:49:37,- Yeah.
00:49:37,00:49:37,- Because he's old.
00:49:37,00:49:39,- He's got an arthritic hip.
00:49:39,00:49:40,- Yeah.
00:49:40,00:49:44,- That must require him to keep still
00:49:44,00:49:45,more often than he'd like.
00:49:45,00:49:46,- Absolutely.
00:49:46,00:49:49,"- It's funny 'cause he's got a lovely website,"
00:49:49,00:49:50,and he lists his hobbies on it.
00:49:50,00:49:51,- Does he?
00:49:51,00:49:52,I didn't see his website.
00:49:52,00:49:53,"- Oh, yeah, it's a great website."
00:49:53,00:49:55,"Yeah, he owns multiple motorbikes,"
00:49:55,00:49:57,and he plays bowls.
00:49:57,00:49:58,- Does he?
00:49:58,00:49:59,"- That was quite a rare combo, I think,"
00:49:59,00:50:00,like having a Harley-Davidson
00:50:00,00:50:02,and playing crown green bowls.
00:50:02,00:50:03,- Is it?
00:50:03,00:50:04,"- Well, one seems quite hard to call."
00:50:04,00:50:05,"- No, you're right."
00:50:05,00:50:07,"In Hell's Angels, they were famous for their bowls, Matt."
00:50:07,00:50:09,"- Sorry, they're the only people at motorbike."
00:50:09,00:50:10,I forgot that as well.
00:50:10,00:50:11,- He's got a big Harley-Davidson.
00:50:11,00:50:12,He's got a--
00:50:12,00:50:15,- I associate both with real ale pubs.
00:50:15,00:50:17,- I bet he loves a real ale.
00:50:17,00:50:19,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:50:19,00:50:22,"Some other animals, queue, I didn't know this."
00:50:22,00:50:23,- Okay.
00:50:23,00:50:24,"- Yeah, so--"
00:50:24,00:50:25,"- Hunts, probably, I reckon."
00:50:25,00:50:26,- Hunts.
00:50:26,00:50:27,"- Yeah, must do, yeah."
00:50:27,00:50:30,"Fish, queue, there are fish which queue."
00:50:30,00:50:32,"Yeah, there's small goby fish, right?"
00:50:32,00:50:34,They have this thing where they have a mating queue.
00:50:34,00:50:36,"Okay, this is really, this is a bit sexy, actually."
00:50:36,00:50:38,"So only the top male and female mate, right?"
00:50:38,00:50:40,And all the other females have to wait in a queue
00:50:40,00:50:42,before they can have sex.
00:50:42,00:50:44,"I think with the top male, but maybe it's actually,"
00:50:44,00:50:46,"there's a queue, there's a sort of queue of males,"
00:50:46,00:50:47,I don't know.
00:50:47,00:50:49,"But basically, to organize the queue,"
00:50:49,00:50:51,they do it by a pecking order of sexiness.
00:50:51,00:50:54,And sexiness is body mass for them.
00:50:54,00:50:56,So the biggest female is the sexiest one
00:50:56,00:50:58,"and gets to have sex first, right?"
00:50:58,00:51:00,And then the next biggest and so on.
00:51:00,00:51:02,"And they can measure, you know how in school"
00:51:02,00:51:04,you had to line up for fire drills and things
00:51:04,00:51:05,with a height order.
00:51:05,00:51:06,"- Did you, okay?"
00:51:06,00:51:07,"- Well, we did, yeah."
00:51:07,00:51:09,"- Well, you're not too tall for that."
00:51:09,00:51:12,"- I was always left to burn, wasn't it?"
00:51:12,00:51:14,(laughing)
00:51:14,00:51:16,"But the fish can tell their body mass, right?"
00:51:16,00:51:20,"So if the difference is more than 5% of their body mass,"
00:51:20,00:51:22,"like between one female and the next,"
00:51:22,00:51:23,"they will queue neatly, right?"
00:51:23,00:51:25,And because they know who's bigger they can see.
00:51:25,00:51:27,"- Well, 'cause they've all got scales, haven't they?"
00:51:27,00:51:29,(laughing)
00:51:30,00:51:32,- But if the difference is smaller than 5%
00:51:32,00:51:34,"between two females in the queue,"
00:51:34,00:51:36,the smaller one will try and queue jump.
00:51:36,00:51:37,"And we'll sort of say, this is, there's enough,"
00:51:37,00:51:40,"there's a small enough difference, I think I could do it."
00:51:40,00:51:42,And then the bigger one will drive it out of the group.
00:51:42,00:51:43,We'll sort of force it out of the queue.
00:51:43,00:51:44,They'll have a fight.
00:51:44,00:51:47,"- Well, I think during that fight they both lose weight."
00:51:47,00:51:47,(laughing)
00:51:47,00:51:49,"- This is what they, okay."
00:51:49,00:51:50,"- Okay, it's similar to that."
00:51:50,00:51:53,Smaller fish will sometimes adjust their own size.
00:51:53,00:51:56,They will lose weight to avoid presenting a challenge
00:51:56,00:51:57,to the fish that's bigger than them.
00:51:57,00:51:59,So they don't get in a fight and they don't queue jump.
00:51:59,00:52:01,"They say, right, I'll just shrink my own body."
00:52:01,00:52:02,- How do they do that?
00:52:02,00:52:04,- I guess they don't eat for a while.
00:52:04,00:52:06,"- Oh, in the lead up to the queue, not as in, okay."
00:52:06,00:52:07,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Not on the spot."
00:52:07,00:52:11,"They can't do like a special, like shit everything else."
00:52:11,00:52:14,"- Famous queue, when McDonald's opened in Moscow."
00:52:14,00:52:15,- Oh yeah.
00:52:15,00:52:20,"- In 1990, people queued for six hours to get a McDonald's."
00:52:20,00:52:25,"They served 30,000 people on the first day."
00:52:25,00:52:29,And one Big Mac cost 3.75 rubles.
00:52:29,00:52:32,And a monthly wage was 150 rubles.
00:52:32,00:52:34,So that is the equivalent today
00:52:34,00:52:38,"of a Big Mac costing 52 pounds, 78 pence."
00:52:38,00:52:39,- Wow. - Wow.
00:52:39,00:52:41,"- Yeah, and people queued for six hours to get that."
00:52:41,00:52:42,- Jesus.
00:52:42,00:52:44,"- 'Cause if someone tells you it's that expensive,"
00:52:44,00:52:45,you think it must be worth it.
00:52:45,00:52:46,"- Exactly, yeah."
00:52:46,00:52:51,"There was 700 seats inside and 200 outside of this,"
00:52:51,00:52:53,this McDonald's in Pushkin Sky Square.
00:52:53,00:52:57,"And so 900 people, that's about the same as a Globe Theater."
00:52:57,00:52:59,It was the largest McDonald's in the world
00:52:59,00:53:01,until McDonald's left Russia.
00:53:01,00:53:02,- Wow. - Wow.
00:53:02,00:53:06,"- But in a sense, isn't McDonald's really the,"
00:53:06,00:53:10,"you know, the theater sort of space for,"
00:53:10,00:53:12,"- Keep going, you're getting there."
00:53:12,00:53:13,"- You know, it's like."
00:53:13,00:53:14,- I've got no idea where you're going.
00:53:14,00:53:16,- I'm wondering where you're going to believe in him.
00:53:16,00:53:17,- Believe in him.
00:53:17,00:53:18,- He can do this.
00:53:18,00:53:20,"- You know, what do you see at McDonald's late night?"
00:53:20,00:53:21,You see drama.
00:53:21,00:53:21,- Yeah.
00:53:21,00:53:23,"- You know, you go to a McDonald's,"
00:53:23,00:53:25,"and all human life is there, kind of like a theater."
00:53:25,00:53:29,"- My Beth is a Macbeth, I love her Macbeth too."
00:53:29,00:53:31,"- So much there for you, Andy."
00:53:31,00:53:32,- That was what you were going for.
00:53:32,00:53:35,"- I feel like I did a lot of work in the midfield there,"
00:53:35,00:53:37,and I just slaughtered at home.
00:53:37,00:53:40,I'm happy with that. - The shearer of your jokes.
00:53:40,00:53:45,We did on QI once that the way we load airplanes
00:53:45,00:53:46,is totally wrong.
00:53:46,00:53:48,"So you know when you get, you're waiting for a plane"
00:53:48,00:53:51,"and they say, if you're in rows 50 to 70,"
00:53:51,00:53:53,please come forward now.
00:53:53,00:53:55,"And they load the back first, which seems to make sense."
00:53:55,00:53:57,"Well, actually, that's the least efficient way to do it."
00:53:57,00:53:59,"It's way more efficient just to say,"
00:53:59,00:54:01,everyone randomly get on the plane.
00:54:01,00:54:04,"- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, close the door in four minutes."
00:54:04,00:54:05,Go.
00:54:05,00:54:06,- You mean the easy jet system.
00:54:06,00:54:08,(laughing)
00:54:08,00:54:10,- Leave the kids go.
00:54:10,00:54:12,"- Well, the great thing is if you have kids,"
00:54:12,00:54:13,you get to the front of the queue.
00:54:13,00:54:15,"- Yeah, although that is one of the best ways to do it"
00:54:15,00:54:17,"is to make sure the slow loaders,"
00:54:17,00:54:20,i.e. people with kids do get on first.
00:54:20,00:54:21,"- That's why they do it, I guess."
00:54:21,00:54:23,"- But yeah, someone studied it mathematically"
00:54:23,00:54:24,and realized that loading from the back
00:54:24,00:54:26,is actually slower than doing it randomly
00:54:26,00:54:28,"'cause people bunch up and they block each other,"
00:54:28,00:54:29,but you're not loading the empty spaces.
00:54:29,00:54:31,"And actually, one really good way to do it"
00:54:31,00:54:34,"is do window seats, then aisle seats, then middle seats."
00:54:34,00:54:35,"- Oh, cool."
00:54:35,00:54:35,- Vice versa.
00:54:35,00:54:36,"- Yeah, that's mad."
00:54:36,00:54:38,"- I mean, it is an insane way of doing it."
00:54:38,00:54:39,- That's insane.
00:54:39,00:54:40,"- 'Cause you're with, let's say you're three people"
00:54:40,00:54:42,"going on a plane, a family."
00:54:42,00:54:43,- Yeah.
00:54:43,00:54:44,"- All right, just dad first."
00:54:44,00:54:45,(laughing)
00:54:45,00:54:46,- Now the four-year-old on their own.
00:54:46,00:54:49,(laughing)
00:54:49,00:54:50,"Families are like,"
00:54:50,00:54:51,"""I do think that is a cool way of doing it."""
00:54:51,00:54:52,"Because then, everyone's slotted,"
00:54:52,00:54:55,everyone goes to the end of their row where the windows are
00:54:55,00:54:58,and no one's faffing about in the corridor bit of the plane.
00:54:58,00:54:59,"- They're not doing it on purpose, Andy."
00:54:59,00:55:01,They just need to get their bags into the--
00:55:01,00:55:02,- I'm not sure the window seat knocks that out
00:55:02,00:55:05,because you still need to get your bag into the top bit.
00:55:05,00:55:06,"- Well, I think the key thing to do"
00:55:06,00:55:07,is everyone just carries the bag with them
00:55:07,00:55:09,and just holds it in their arms until the plane's taken off.
00:55:09,00:55:11,"Then you can put it up in the racks, Vove."
00:55:11,00:55:13,- I don't think you're allowed to hold the bags
00:55:13,00:55:16,"in your arms, especially if you're on an emergency exit seat."
00:55:16,00:55:17,"- Yeah, that's true, yeah."
00:55:17,00:55:20,"- Andy, I'm afraid, I'm afraid to sit in front of you."
00:55:20,00:55:21,Anyway.
00:55:21,00:55:22,"- Oh, well, don't fly."
00:55:22,00:55:24,(laughing)
00:55:24,00:55:26,- I was reading a website called LineLogic
00:55:26,00:55:30,and they specialize in looking at public guidances
00:55:30,00:55:31,and line management solutions.
00:55:31,00:55:34,And so they go into businesses and try and sort out
00:55:34,00:55:36,how they can best manage their crowds and stuff.
00:55:36,00:55:40,And they say that the word faffing directly relates
00:55:40,00:55:43,to the idea of getting to the front of a queue
00:55:43,00:55:45,and then waiting for that person
00:55:45,00:55:46,"who's just in front of you, who's paid"
00:55:46,00:55:49,to sort of gather their things together.
00:55:49,00:55:51,The faffing that they do of sort of like
00:55:51,00:55:53,putting their wallet back and stuff.
00:55:53,00:55:54,"- Well, like that's the first instance"
00:55:54,00:55:55,of the word faffing.
00:55:55,00:55:56,- It's what this website is.
00:55:56,00:55:57,- What is this website?
00:55:57,00:55:58,Who are these people?
00:55:58,00:55:59,- It's LineLogic.
00:55:59,00:56:00,- What are their credentials?
00:56:00,00:56:01,"- I'm back 'em, that's great."
00:56:01,00:56:02,- But they say that faffing time
00:56:02,00:56:05,takes roughly 3.17 seconds.
00:56:05,00:56:07,"That's the average faff that you'll have, yeah."
00:56:07,00:56:09,- That's plausible.
00:56:09,00:56:11,'Cause you can pride yourself on being a non-faffer
00:56:11,00:56:13,once you're at the front of a queue.
00:56:13,00:56:15,"Right now I've got my wallet, I'm ready,"
00:56:15,00:56:16,"I'm ready to put the card away,"
00:56:16,00:56:17,"I'm ready to grab the thing, go, you know."
00:56:17,00:56:19,Or you can faff.
00:56:19,00:56:19,- Yeah.
00:56:19,00:56:20,"- I wonder which you are, Andy."
00:56:20,00:56:21,- Yeah.
00:56:21,00:56:22,(laughing)
00:56:22,00:56:24,- I pride myself on my non-faffing.
00:56:24,00:56:26,"- You really amazed us, really."
00:56:26,00:56:29,"- Oh, you guys were expecting that, I see, yeah."
00:56:29,00:56:31,- It felt like a weighted survey
00:56:31,00:56:33,when you explained the difference between the two.
00:56:33,00:56:36,- Because they do say some people are absolutely awesome
00:56:36,00:56:39,and they always know exactly how to leave a check out.
00:56:39,00:56:41,- And you get these complete arseholes.
00:56:41,00:56:44,"- Well, I panic am annoying the people behind me, basically."
00:56:44,00:56:44,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:56:44,00:56:46,- The time when you finished your transaction
00:56:46,00:56:49,"feels, you know, longer to you."
00:56:49,00:56:51,"- I agree, I often rush off without my shopping."
00:56:51,00:56:53,(laughing)
00:56:53,00:56:54,- But I feel you're the type of personality
00:56:54,00:56:56,that would wanna make sure that was acknowledged.
00:56:56,00:56:58,And then so you would somehow waste the person
00:56:58,00:56:59,behind you's time going.
00:56:59,00:57:00,"- Wait, why am I--"
00:57:00,00:57:03,"- No worries, get in out of your way there so quickly."
00:57:03,00:57:07,"- Oh, just don't worry, just another day being a hero, yeah."
00:57:07,00:57:09,"- I reckon you just go, ""Beep!"""
00:57:09,00:57:10,- Yeah.
00:57:10,00:57:12,"- Three seconds, 24, very good."
00:57:12,00:57:14,- Enjoy that extra second I'll say you do.
00:57:14,00:57:16,(laughing)
00:57:16,00:57:18,(upbeat music)
