00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:17.100
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.820
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.900
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covern Garden.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.020
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.060
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.380
 Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.820
 And once again, we have gathered round the microphones

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.540
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.820
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.260
 Starting with fact number one, that is James.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.500
 - Okay, my fact this week is that in 1910,

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.340
 the World Health Organization tried to ban kissing.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.180
 - Wow.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.380
 You think that'd be a bigger story

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.980
 given such a huge organization, right?

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.700
 - Especially as it happened 30 years before they existed.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.540
 - Yes.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:56.380
 - You would think so.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.220
 Thank you.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.300
 - What's going on here?

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.700
 - If you listen very carefully,

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.620
 you will have heard me say the world's health organization

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.460
 as opposed to the more commonly known

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.500
 world health organization.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.900
 And this was an organization.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.060
 And when I say an organization,

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.060
 I mean really one woman in America called Imogene Recton.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.060
 And she decided that everyone should stop kissing.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.180
 And she got all the newspapers and invented a load

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.860
 of badges and pledges and stuff like that.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.500
 And really thought that if people stopped kissing,

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.540
 then maybe we could stop the spread of disease,

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.220
 things like consumption, typhus, all that kind of stuff.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.060
 - Yeah.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.100
 - She kind of, she kind of been completely wrong.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.940
 - Yeah.

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.100
 - If everyone stopped kissing everyone else,

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.140
 we'd have fewer diseases.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.980
 - Yeah.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.460
 - Well, we did try it for half a year in 2020,

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.300
 if you remember.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.260
 - And no one got a cold.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.740
 So, you know, I'm just saying maybe the cost

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.580
 is greater than the benefit.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.700
 - Yeah, but I feel like she was almost ahead of her time

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.780
 understanding then about exchange of possible germs.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.900
 I mean, our mouths are rank.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.620
 We've got like billions of bacteria in them.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.740
 I know a lot of them are probably good bacteria.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.100
 But I think there was a study done that had people drink

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.180
 like a yakult or a probiotic drink

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.100
 and then had them snog their partner.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.220
 And they found the 80 million bacteria transferred

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.100
 from one face to the other.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.420
 - Bacteria is tiny though.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.420
 Yeah, 80 million.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.260
 - 80 million.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.700
 - We don't know how much that is, do we?

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:19.740
 - Is there everything where it's like,

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.300
 oh, three bacteria transferred, it's gonna be big, right?

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.140
 - It's such a good point.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.740
 - Even if three bacteria transferred before long,

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:28.580
 there's gonna be more than,

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.700
 there's gonna be four, five, six.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.020
 - There you go, that's true, there you go.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.860
 - They are rampant.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:32.820
 - She does sound amazing.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:33.660
 - Yeah.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.500
 - Imogene as well.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.500
 - Imogene.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.260
 - Weirdly, some newspapers call her Imogene,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.660
 but I think they might be misprints.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.100
 'Cause most of them say Imogene.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.980
 - She got a lot of support.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:44.820
 She got some support.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:45.780
 She got a thousand acolytes,

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.340
 which I think is a good hit rate

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.340
 for this slightly dramatic campaign.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.380
 - She's got a number of acolytes.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.220
 - Yeah.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.500
 Well, including 70 brides

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.620
 who declined to be kissed at their own weddings.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.700
 - Which I think, yeah.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.540
 - Yeah.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.460
 - You may now kiss a bride.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:59.340
 No, you may not.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.620
 - Yeah.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.980
 - So in the article that you sent over, James,

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:03.820
 when you found this,

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.620
 there was a nice little thing that she,

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.220
 it starts off by saying that she'd convinced her husband

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.060
 of the risks associated with promiscuous kissing,

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.900
 which sounds like she had a bit of a dog in the race

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:14.740
 to begin with.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.180
 Yeah, she had a husband.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.820
 - So he was a big kisser, right?

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.860
 - Well, I think what it sounds like,

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.300
 reading further into the article,

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.100
 is that kissing on the lips and kissing generally

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.740
 was much more what you just did.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:26.980
 If you had parties at the house,

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.260
 everyone would kiss each other on the lips.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.100
 Women would kiss each other,

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.060
 men would kiss men.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.900
 - 1910.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:31.740
 - That's my party.

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.340
 - That's what her husband was telling her anyway.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.780
 First of all, the keys go in the bowl,

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:36.900
 then we start kissing,

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.500
 and then we'll see what happens.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.500
 - Yeah, I don't think men were snogging each other that much.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.940
 By 1910, there've been phases when the kiss has been in,

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.780
 but I think her husband's been just spinning out yarn.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:45.940
 - I did just throw that in.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:46.780
 I have to admit,

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.500
 it was definitely said women were kissing women.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.540
 I thought, well, men should be kissing men.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:52.500
 - I was in France recently.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.060
 I saw, I was in the South of France,

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.540
 and I was in a particularly kissy region.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:56.380
 - Oh yeah.

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.200
 - It was a very kissy region.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.140
 I think I saw some people kissing four times.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.980
 - Yeah.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:00.820
 - But there's more.

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:01.660
 - Way more.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.500
 - I think you do get, there are fives definitely.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:04.340
 - I've had a good five or six.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.660
 - I've had a good five or six.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:06.500
 - You've had a six kiss.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.140
 - Yeah, I lived in France for three months

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.580
 with my grandmother in 2003.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:10.460
 I've had a six.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:11.300
 You start counting when it.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.140
 - Six.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.300
 - Six, I've had a six.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.380
 Maybe she wanted to give me six.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.220
 - I've seen a five.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.060
 - Your grandmother.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.900
 (laughing)

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.980
 - No, her oldie mates.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.900
 - All the grandmas at the retirement.

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:22.780
 Maybe they forget.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:23.780
 Maybe they forgot.

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:24.740
 (laughing)

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.180
 Halfway through, they're like, ah.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.020
 - What am I on?

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.860
 - I'm gonna start again.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.700
 - You can be stuck in the old people's name for hours,

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:30.540
 go on you.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:31.940
 - Think about older people kissing.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.260
 This was actually one of Imogene's theories.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.540
 And she thought that if she could stop older people

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:38.980
 from kissing each other,

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.780
 and actually more like stopping them from kissing children,

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.820
 then eventually when the older generation died out,

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.780
 so kissing would die out.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.660
 'Cause the children wouldn't have got it

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.940
 into their system that it's a thing that you do.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:51.780
 That was her plan.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:52.620
 - That's interesting.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.820
 Probably would have worked if she'd, again, if.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.420
 - If she's got more than a thousand acolytes.

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:57.260
 - Yeah.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:58.100
 - Yeah.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.940
 - Yeah.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.700
 - Look at this cultural thing, you know, it's a learned thing.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:01.700
 - We assume it is.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:02.860
 Yeah, I think there's some debate, isn't there?

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.380
 But I think we assume it's a learned thing largely

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.780
 because about just over half of societies don't do it.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:09.740
 - Yeah.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.500
 So the number is 46% do do it of cultures

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.140
 that were looked at to see whether lip to lip kissing

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.980
 was a thing.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:17.900
 - But what's a culture?

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.940
 - As in is Britain one culture?

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.180
 - No, no, no, it's not like Britain.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.060
 It's obviously tiny minorities of people

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.420
 'cause the vast majority of people on earth do kiss now

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.100
 because we're a globalized society.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.140
 But if you go to an Amazonian tribe

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.380
 or Papua New Guinea or something.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.220
 - Yeah, right.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.060
 - I think it's particularly uncommon

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.460
 in parts of China, parts of Mongolia.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.380
 That area is quite uncommon.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.140
 - So it was 168 cultures from around the world.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.940
 This was a professor of anthropology

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.420
 at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas,

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.540
 which I assume is a serious university.

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.340
 - I just associated it with gambling.

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.180
 I don't know why.

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.420
 - Las Vegas, it does do all the stuff.

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.860
 - That university is a very wealthy one actually

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.060
 'cause one year, a few decades ago,

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.380
 they put everything on red.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.780
 And yeah, I could use it out now.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.620
 - The first person who kind of observed

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.140
 that a lot of these cultures don't do mouth to mouth kissing

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:07.420
 was a guy called Paul Denjoy.

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.380
 So it's de-apostrophe and then enjoy.

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:11.220
 - Don't enjoy.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:12.060
 - Don't enjoy.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.020
 - It's such a good name.

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.420
 He said that some people considered it an abomination

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.380
 and a form of cannibalism.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:18.220
 - Oh, come on.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.980
 That's someone kissing too hard.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.540
 - It's a step on the road,

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:22.860
 it's a step on the road to cannibalism.

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:23.700
 It's a slippery slope.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.860
 - So just back to Imogen very quickly.

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.020
 I read a lot of newspaper articles about her

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:31.340
 because in 1910 and 1911, she was everywhere.

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.180
 Obviously, the newspapers saw this story

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.620
 that they're trying to ban kissing and they loved it.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:40.380
 She was known as the foe of oculation in the press.

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.900
 Oculation being another word for kissing.

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.180
 And in August of 1910,

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.100
 she tried to organize a no kiss August,

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.180
 which you know, it's like, no drink January

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.380
 or whatever they call it in November.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.900
 I reckon this might be the first of those.

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.340
 In 1910, it must be early.

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.100
 But then by 1912, there were no more mentions

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.900
 of her on newspapers.com.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.140
 So after two years, the press weren't interested anymore.

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:07.540
 - Do we know any more about her story at all?

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.740
 Like, do we know when she died or?

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.660
 - I know when someone with her name died.

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.260
 Well, I couldn't tell if it was definitely her.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:15.260
 So, I'm not really sure.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:16.900
 She kind of went away after that.

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.540
 - Two hemorrhageans.

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.300
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:24.180
 - 13% of people, so they've been accidentally

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:25.700
 kissed on the mouth at work.

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.860
 - How does that?

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:29.580
 - Dan says, "Oh, yeah."

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:32.020
 Dan gets around kissing people on the mouth all the time.

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:35.060
 - Sometimes the turn comes too sharply.

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.620
 - An air kiss, to another air kiss.

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.340
 - Especially when you're doing seven.

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:42.220
 - I found someone else who has an anti-kissing rule.

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:43.620
 - Oh, yeah? - Oh, yeah.

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:46.460
 - And it's Champion Whistlers.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.420
 Specifically one Champion Whistler,

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.300
 who's a guy called Christopher Ullman,

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:55.060
 who I think has won at the International Whistlers Convention.

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.100
 And there are lots of different kinds of whistling.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.020
 And he says he has a no-kissing rule

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.900
 for 24 hours before a performance.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:01.740
 - Interesting.

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:04.820
 - Well, he must have a lot of whistling groupies.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:06.060
 - Yeah, he sounds great.

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:09.500
 He says it makes your lips mushy kissing before a performance.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:11.100
 So he doesn't lick his lips,

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.340
 which I'm very impressed by.

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:13.340
 - God, that's amazing.

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:15.260
 Now, they must be dry, parched, and dry

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:16.180
 by the time he's whistling.

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:19.300
 - But then they must be like a solid whistle, right?

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:20.140
 - Have you got dry lips?

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:21.620
 I think it's very hard to whistle, isn't it?

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:22.620
 - Is it?

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:24.380
 What does he say, Andy?

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:26.980
 - I don't actually know how he moises them.

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:28.420
 I've only got other details,

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:32.020
 like he can do Mozart's oboe concerto, the oboe part,

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:34.020
 but whistling, which is hard.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:35.500
 - I think most people can do any part, right?

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.700
 - Yeah, most people can whistle any tune.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.220
 - If it's a tune, it's whistleable.

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.860
 - The problem is none of us knows Mozart's oboe concerto.

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:43.060
 - That piece, that's a good point.

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:43.900
 That's a very good point.

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.580
 - So when his stooge in the crowd goes,

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.140
 I bet no one here can do that.

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:48.340
 (all laughing)

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:49.580
 - And then he does it and everyone's like,

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:52.260
 is that that, is that that?

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.020
 - Better to do a plane engine though, or a drill,

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:59.540
 or, you know, something that doesn't sound like a whistle.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:00.380
 - Yeah.

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:01.220
 - Exactly.

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.100
 - What would the point, what was that?

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:03.940
 - It was a drill.

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:05.180
 - That was Beethoven's.

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:07.140
 (all laughing)

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:08.580
 - All right, well, we're just currently driven

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:09.700
 by this guy's whole career.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:11.940
 - No, but it's interesting because I, you know, how would you...

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:13.420
 - It can't be his career.

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:14.900
 (all laughing)

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:15.740
 - It's unclear.

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:16.580
 It's unclear.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:17.420
 (all laughing)

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:18.700
 - I know he's got all these groupies,

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.420
 but really, you make it looking out for.

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:21.860
 - They asked him, in this interview,

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.500
 if his family gets sick of the whistling,

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:24.860
 and he said, "I actually don't whistle

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:25.980
 "around the house very much.

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:29.180
 "Random, idle whistling is very annoying."

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:32.540
 - Well, that's, someone's told him that a lot of times.

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:35.540
 In 1921, in the newspapers,

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:38.300
 there was a worry about people kissing freckled girls

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:40.100
 on the cheeks.

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:43.540
 Can you guess why that might be dangerous?

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:44.620
 This was in the newspapers.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:47.100
 - Freckles come off, they go on your lips.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.460
 You get a lip covered in freckles, can't eat you stuff.

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:52.060
 - Or would they thought to be contagious, I guess, is the...

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:52.900
 - Freckles?

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:54.700
 - Yeah, in the 1920s.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:55.860
 (all laughing)

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:57.820
 - Was this a justified thing, or was it a great...

00:09:57.820 --> 00:09:59.700
 Okay, so it's justified.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:00.860
 Freckled girls.

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:03.740
 - Because, because, because they are out in the sun,

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.940
 so they are wearing what, back in the 1920s,

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:07.980
 was radioactive sunscreen.

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:08.820
 - You're so close.

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:10.020
 - Yeah, so the sunscreen had chemicals in it.

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:11.820
 - No, no, don't carry on with the wrong answer.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:12.660
 - Okay, okay, just try...

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:15.420
 - Radioactive sunscreen, which meant that to kiss them

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.380
 would give radiation, and you'd become...

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:18.580
 - Yeah, have a radioactive part.

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:19.420
 - Oh, okay.

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:20.460
 - It's the being outside part.

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:21.300
 - No.

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:22.140
 - Poisonous makeup.

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:23.060
 - Almost.

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:27.020
 Basically, there was a antifreckle medication

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:29.820
 that people were using to try and get rid of their freckles,

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.020
 and it was toxic if ingested.

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:34.700
 And so there was a danger, according to the newspapers,

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.540
 if you kissed a freckled girl on the cheek,

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:37.780
 you might get sick.

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:39.260
 - Oh, my gosh.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:40.900
 - That's awful, 'cause the girls are gonna think

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:42.340
 that their medication isn't working at all,

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:44.060
 'cause still no one's kissing them.

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.380
 - Yeah.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:46.700
 - Alternatives to kissing,

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:47.980
 which people have had to come up with,

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:50.740
 these poor societies that don't have kissing.

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:53.780
 Darwin, who met a lot of people in his life,

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:54.780
 different peoples,

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:57.220
 listed a bunch of alternatives to kissing in cultures,

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:00.580
 and he listed rubbing of noses,

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:03.380
 like which lapplanders he's known as do,

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:06.140
 rubbing or patting of the arms, breasts, or stomachs,

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.740
 or one man striking his own face

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:11.220
 with the hands or feet of another.

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:12.660
 - Like a slap, proper slap.

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:13.980
 - It's like, why are you hitting yourself?

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:14.820
 Why are you hitting yourself?

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.100
 - Oh, right.

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:17.900
 - Well, actually, it's not you hitting yourself,

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:19.980
 it's me grabbing your hand

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:21.940
 and then hitting me in the face with your hand.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:23.740
 - You are actually hitting yourself, yeah.

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:24.580
 - Why are you hitting me?

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:25.420
 Why are you hitting me?

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:26.260
 - Yeah, why are you hitting me?

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:27.100
 - Was that a game?

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:27.940
 Why are you hitting me?

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:28.780
 (laughing)

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:31.180
 - It was a cat phrase, you could say, yeah, yeah.

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:32.620
 - Can I talk about very quickly

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:34.140
 some other public health stuff?

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:34.980
 - Yeah.

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:37.060
 - Especially done by American women.

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:40.060
 So this is a group of middle-class women from Manhattan

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:43.460
 called the Ladies Health Protective Association.

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:47.020
 And they, basically, there was a huge pile of manure

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:50.380
 in the middle of New York, okay?

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:54.420
 They covered two blocks and stood 30 feet tall.

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:57.460
 - I was picturing much smaller when you said there was a pile.

00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:58.300
 (laughing)

00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:59.140
 - That's incredible.

00:11:59.140 --> 00:11:59.980
 - Like the Godzilla.

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.100
 - So what they would do is, obviously,

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:02.780
 a lot of horses in those days, right?

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:05.180
 They would collect the manure from stables

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:07.220
 and they would sell it as fertilizer to farmers

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:08.260
 who were just outside the city,

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:09.420
 but they needed someone to keep it

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:12.180
 and so they just kept it in the middle of the street.

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:13.860
 It was this guy called, weirdly enough,

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:15.540
 he was called Michael Caine.

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:17.260
 (laughing)

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:20.020
 But Caine, as in Harry Caine, with a K.

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:23.260
 But anyway, Michael Caine had this huge manure pile

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.180
 and he was making loads of money.

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:27.340
 He was making $300,000 a year,

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:30.580
 which today is about $8 million from this manure pile.

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:32.780
 And his brother-in-law was a New York state senator,

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:33.820
 so everyone thought there was nothing

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:35.380
 they could do about it.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.780
 Anyway, this Ladies Health Protective Association

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:39.900
 came along and did a court case

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:42.020
 and amazingly, they won it.

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:43.660
 They basically called it a nuisance

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.420
 and by the law, there was no way that he could get around it

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:49.020
 because of this technical thing they called it.

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:51.820
 And not only that, the Board of Health denied any permits

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:53.500
 for any manure dumps in the whole city.

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.740
 So that's why, if you go to New York now,

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:57.940
 there's not a 30-foot pile.

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:01.180
 - I've always wondered why there's not a 30-foot pile.

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.900
 - And this group then turned to spitting.

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.740
 Sorry, they turned to stop spitting, okay.

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:09.660
 And that was when New York became the first city

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:11.540
 in the world that banned spitting.

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.540
 - Isn't it true that in the middle of the Central Park,

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:17.180
 there was a massive reservoir of spit?

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:18.980
 - Disgusting.

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:20.620
 - Okay, on with the podcast.

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:23.200
 (upbeat music)

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:27.700
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:29.780
 and that is Andy.

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:33.140
 - My fact is that after King Charles I was decapitated,

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:35.660
 he was recapitated.

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:37.860
 - Oh, you just made that word up.

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:39.900
 - Yeah, so King Charles I,

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:43.180
 only King who's ever been executed,

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:44.980
 I guess loads of them have been killed in battles

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:46.180
 and things like that.

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:49.820
 But it was in 1649 and it was just after the English Civil War

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:53.540
 and obviously huge move, you know, big old move.

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:54.380
 - Big deal.

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:55.380
 - Political chaos, yeah.

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:57.380
 But the King's body basically had to be seen

00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:00.980
 and the authorities, the sort of Republican authorities

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:04.260
 wanted to say, look, he's definitely dead

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:05.780
 and he's not coming back.

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:09.060
 So they employed a surgeon after the execution

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:11.060
 to stitch the head back on.

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:13.320
 - I would have thought that if I'd have seen

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.580
 his body without the head,

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:16.380
 that would be even more proof that he wasn't alive.

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:17.220
 - That's a good point.

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:19.380
 - It sort of looks like he was kind of coming back

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:22.140
 in the head that's meant to be off with suddenly back on.

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:23.940
 - Anyway, I should say quickly where I got this from,

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:25.140
 I've been reading a book.

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:25.980
 It's actually from a novel.

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:27.540
 It's called "Act of Oblivion"

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:30.500
 and it's all about the hunt for the regicides.

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:31.540
 - Is it by Thomas Harris?

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:32.740
 - No, by Robert Harris.

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:33.580
 - Robert Harris, yeah, yeah.

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:36.860
 - So basically, and it describes in incredibly gory detail

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:39.820
 the death of the King and also the death of the regicides

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:41.940
 who the people who signed the death warrant and all this

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:44.140
 and who really, they really put through the ringer.

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:46.220
 - Yeah, this is, we should say for internationalists,

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:47.260
 they didn't put them through the ringer

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:48.220
 as soon as they'd killed the King.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:49.380
 It wasn't like you've executed the King

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:50.420
 and now we're gonna execute you.

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:51.940
 It was when the restoration happened.

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:53.300
 So there was a brief period

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:55.460
 where everyone was pro-killing the monarchy.

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:59.180
 And then sadly, yeah, after a decade, monarchy came back

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:01.940
 and then all the regicides got hunted down sadly.

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:04.020
 - Sadly, Aniseh, sadly monarchy came back.

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:05.500
 - From the perspective of a round head,

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:08.660
 I was adopting the character of Oliver Cromwell.

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:10.940
 - So I didn't know anything about Charles the First

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:12.100
 having not grown up in this country.

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:14.940
 So I am one of these foreign listeners, as it were,

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:15.780
 that you mentioned, Anna.

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:18.860
 And it struck me that what a big deal it was

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:21.220
 to kill the King off the back of a trial.

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:22.060
 'Cause there's all this stuff.

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:23.420
 And Oliver Cromwell is a name

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:26.140
 that is very much part of the decision

00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:28.020
 to bring him to trial and have him execute.

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:29.860
 - A key player.

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:32.580
 - And the story gets quite gruesome

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:34.700
 when we talk about what happened to him and the others

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.020
 some 30 years later after the death.

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:37.860
 - Only 10 years later.

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:38.980
 - Sorry, 10 years later.

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:41.220
 - Okay, so 1649, Charles was killed.

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:43.140
 And then recapitated, right?

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:46.060
 1650, I think it was eight, Oliver Cromwell died

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:48.700
 after less than 10 years in office.

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:51.580
 And then two years later, the monarchy is restored, 1660.

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:55.540
 Then at that point, Oliver Cromwell is dug up

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:57.260
 and decapitated.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:02.260
 So both Charles and Cromwell had a head-altering situation.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:03.740
 - They should have switched the rounds.

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:05.260
 It was freaking Friday.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:06.660
 - Freaking Friday.

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:09.060
 - It was his son, was it King Charles II,

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:11.660
 who was a direct son of Charles I,

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:15.220
 who then was the person in charge of the monarchy once?

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:17.620
 - The person in charge of the monarchy or the king?

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:18.460
 (all laughing)

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:20.860
 - Well, that's surprising that it disappeared for 11 years.

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:23.580
 I mean, that is a pretty big deal.

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:25.020
 It wasn't just overthrowing the monarchy,

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:27.380
 it was overthrowing all of the monarchy.

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:28.220
 - It was the other deal.

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:29.060
 - It was one of the biggest things

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:30.120
 that's ever happened in England's history.

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:31.860
 - I was just saying, as a foreigner,

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:33.700
 you don't follow, sorry, good up to date

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:34.700
 on Charles the first.

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:36.660
 - You have lived here for about 20 years now.

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:38.260
 I feel like you should have some point.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.580
 - Yeah, it should have been as I was coming to immigration.

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:42.660
 - Did you not have to do an exam to get into the UK?

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:43.500
 - No, a British.

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:45.700
 - Well, do you want to know something really interesting?

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:48.020
 It's not in a lot of the citizenship tests,

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:49.460
 or at least a couple of years ago,

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:50.780
 there was a really good article on--

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:52.040
 - Maybe question number one.

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:54.300
 (laughing)

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:56.300
 - There was a really good article on history today

00:16:56.300 --> 00:17:00.340
 about how it wasn't in the test for new immigrants.

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:01.740
 There was nothing about the civil war,

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:03.580
 anything like that, and missed that whole period.

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:06.620
 And someone asked immigration,

00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:08.220
 why isn't this included?

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:11.020
 And they said the wounds are still too fresh.

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:13.060
 So I spoke first and said,

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:15.980
 the assumption is that we are all anti-cromwell.

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:17.260
 Obviously parliamentarian,

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:18.780
 didn't believe in the divine right of kings.

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:20.660
 The reason that Charles the first was overthrown

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:22.220
 was because he really went hard

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:23.260
 on the divine right of kings as well.

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:24.100
 He loved it, didn't he?

00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:26.580
 Like he prorogued parliament for 11 years,

00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:27.580
 didn't want to ask them anything,

00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:29.340
 and then told them to give him loads of money.

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:31.100
 He was into absolutist monarchy.

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:32.300
 - And when they put him on trial,

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:33.740
 he was like, well, you can't put me on trial

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:35.540
 because God put me here, so.

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:36.380
 - Yeah.

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:38.700
 And now I think Cromwell is a bit of a villain

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:39.980
 to almost everyone.

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:42.060
 But in another country, he would be a hero.

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:44.420
 And in fact, in America, he's remembered quite heroically.

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:46.740
 - He's still got a statue outside of parliament.

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:48.220
 - Yeah, which is surprising.

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:49.700
 So he's not, yeah, and that wasn't toppled

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:51.980
 in the old topples of statues period

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:53.140
 that we went through quite recently.

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:54.740
 - No, it wouldn't be.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:57.180
 - After he died, his, or rather after he died,

00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:01.260
 was dug up and then posthumously re-executed.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:02.900
 His body and a couple of comrades,

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:03.900
 they were hanged, beheaded,

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:05.820
 and then the heads were placed on spikes.

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:08.660
 His head stayed on a spike for 25 years.

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:10.020
 - That is the most amazing.

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:11.780
 For me, the most amazing thing about this whole thing.

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:12.620
 - It's a long time.

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:14.580
 - But for 25 years, whenever you came to London,

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:16.740
 you could go and look at a head on the spike.

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:19.460
 And if you came back 25 years later, it would still be there.

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:20.300
 - It's amazing.

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:21.140
 - It's amazing.

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:23.340
 Like, I think about all the shops near my house.

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:26.300
 Most of them are less than five years old

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:27.340
 'cause they just all got-

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:28.180
 - The turnover.

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:29.020
 - Yeah.

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:29.860
 - It was much less than those days.

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:31.580
 You got a lot of custom in the same place for a head.

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:32.420
 - Amazing.

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:34.740
 - But one person who lived through the whole thing

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:37.220
 was Oliver Cromwell's son, Richard.

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:40.660
 So when Cromwell died, he happened so often

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:44.740
 with rulers, tyrants, newly established raids.

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:46.580
 Anyway, they try and hand over to their kids.

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:48.020
 - So let's get rid of the monarchy.

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:50.740
 It's ridiculous that someone could have the divine right

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:52.980
 to rule, but when I die, I want my kids to have it.

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:54.220
 - I actually do think Napoleon too

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:56.460
 is a good name for an emperor.

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:59.140
 So, and anyway, so Richard Cromwell resigned.

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:01.740
 He was not up to the job.

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:05.220
 I mean, he was not, you know, as zealous as his father

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:06.540
 and he didn't have the authority.

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:09.860
 So he was kicked out in 1659, one year later,

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:11.380
 and he just lived out his life.

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:13.100
 He died in 1712.

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:14.380
 I think he moved overseas.

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:16.540
 - I think if your dad's head was on the spike

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:18.780
 in London, you probably would move out of town.

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:20.100
 - You wouldn't say in London, would you?

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:23.140
 - But get this, he died in 1712.

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:24.380
 He lived an incredibly long time.

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:27.100
 So he saw the whole thing and he was the longest-lived

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:30.940
 British head of state until the year 2012

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:34.440
 when he was overtaken by Queen Elizabeth the second prime.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:35.420
 When she was 85.

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:36.980
 So that's the age he lived to.

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:38.700
 So for a long time, the longest-lived head of state

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:39.700
 was Richard Cromwell.

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:41.020
 - That's really funny.

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:43.580
 - Do you know where Oliver Cromwell's head is now?

00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:46.500
 - Oh, was it reburied with the rest of him?

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:50.140
 - No, it was buried in Cambridge University now.

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:53.620
 - Okay, so I read this in a Giles Brandrith book

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:55.660
 and I tweeted him to ask him if this was true

00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:56.620
 and he tweeted me back.

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:58.900
 So I said, "My memory of it goes like this.

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:00.540
 "There is a relic of Oliver Cromwell

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:02.780
 "kept by the chief whip or prime minister.

00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:04.100
 "Have I made that up?"

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:04.940
 I probably have.

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:07.380
 He wrote back, "It's in the drawers at Checkers."

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:09.340
 So my memory is that the skull of--

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:10.780
 - The skull of Oliver Cromwell is in Checkers.

00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:11.940
 - Is in a drawer.

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:12.780
 - In a drawer.

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:17.780
 - And I think I've read it in Brandrith's autobiography,

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:20.580
 his diaries of his time as a politician.

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:23.020
 And in it he says he goes to Checkers and the drawers open

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:25.340
 and they let you see and stroke the skull.

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:26.780
 - Stroke the skull.

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:30.260
 - So what I have in my notes is that one day

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:32.740
 there was a storm and the head blew off the spike

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:33.580
 and they thought, "You know what?

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:35.420
 "It's been here for 25 years.

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:37.180
 "We probably don't need to put it back up again.

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:38.380
 "Everyone's seen it now."

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:39.220
 - They get the idea.

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:40.060
 - Yeah, they get it again.

00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:40.980
 - Exactly.

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:43.900
 - And then the skull was sort of taken away

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:46.500
 and it was just kind of sold in auction after auction

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.300
 and went through a load of families.

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:51.260
 But then it was buried at Sydney Sussex College,

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:52.900
 Cambridge in 1960.

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:53.740
 - Interesting.

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:54.580
 - That's what I've got.

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:56.500
 But I mean, probably like with these things,

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:58.740
 there's probably 20 of those skulls around there.

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:00.860
 - Yeah, and I don't specify what relic I mean.

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:02.540
 He could have thought it might have been a finger

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:03.380
 or something in my head.

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:04.220
 It's his head.

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:05.300
 - Oh well, maybe it's not the head.

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:06.980
 That's more normal if it's a finger.

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:09.260
 'Cause I can't think of a drawer that could even fit a skull.

00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:11.860
 - Oh, I think you can't think of a drawer that could fit a skull.

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:12.700
 - I can't imagine.

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:14.540
 - Are you gonna pull out of that?

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:15.740
 - I should pull out of that.

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:17.580
 I suppose I'm imagining a desk drawer

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:19.900
 and there's old desks and tiny drawers.

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:20.780
 - The bottom drawer,

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:23.460
 universe standard wooden desk will be a bit bigger.

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:25.300
 - But even if that didn't exist,

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:28.020
 it doesn't take much imagination to take a drawer

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:28.980
 and make it slightly deeper.

00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:31.820
 - My head, ironically, my head is not big enough

00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:33.900
 to get around this concept.

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:38.300
 - Have you ever seen a filing cabinet because...

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:39.140
 - Oh, no, don't.

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:39.980
 It's too much.

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:40.820
 - You're gonna flip your lid.

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:42.020
 - I can't take it.

00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:44.860
 So Anna's amazing Freaky Friday idea,

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:46.740
 which I actually think is a brilliant idea.

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:47.740
 - Thank you.

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:49.620
 - Maybe could have been truish

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:52.940
 because when Cromwell's head got put on the spike,

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:56.380
 there was a big rumour around that actually it wasn't his head

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:58.900
 and that they'd mistakenly got on the wrong one

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:02.260
 and it was probably some old King of England.

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:03.900
 They didn't specify which one it was.

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:06.180
 'Cause it was, he was originally buried.

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:07.500
 Was it in Westminster Abbey, I think?

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:08.500
 - Right, yeah.

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:10.500
 - So there was loads of other Kings there

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:12.460
 and they thought that they dug up the wrong thing

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:14.060
 and just put an old King's head there.

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:16.900
 - Surely you just pick the roundest head.

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:17.740
 - Brilliant.

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:18.580
 - Brilliant, yeah.

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:19.420
 - Round head joke.

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:20.260
 - It's a round head joke.

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:21.100
 - Oh, very nice.

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:23.140
 - They did used to toss them in all together a bit.

00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:24.820
 Like actually there was obviously a conundrum

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:25.940
 after Charles was decapitated

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:27.740
 because they don't wanna create a martyr of him

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:30.100
 by having it either be a big thing bearing him

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:31.420
 or not bearing him at all.

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:33.100
 So I think they took him away to Windsor

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:35.660
 and they entered him in Henry VIII's tomb, weirdly.

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:36.500
 - Wow.

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:41.260
 - And then in 1813 they decided to dig him up again.

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:42.420
 I think this was to check.

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:43.260
 - Again, again.

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:44.100
 - He was there, again.

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:45.060
 - Right, okay.

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:45.900
 - Just the first time again.

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:47.940
 - Oh, okay, sorry, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:50.260
 - And it was George III's physician,

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:54.100
 Henry Halford, who was kind of leading the exhumation.

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:57.660
 And he ended up with Charles's vertebra

00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:00.100
 and some beard and some of his teeth.

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:00.940
 - Beard.

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:02.380
 - Which is, yeah, some beard.

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:05.180
 - I'm surprised the beard is still extant

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:06.020
 after all that time.

00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:06.860
 - Yeah.

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:07.700
 - Yeah, that seems weird, doesn't it?

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:08.540
 - From how many years?

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:09.380
 - How many years, did we say?

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:11.500
 - Yeah, well, this was 1813, so it's 100 years.

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:12.340
 - 160 years.

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:13.180
 - What?

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:15.180
 - So he says that they went,

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:16.700
 "Oh, it's not worth opening the coffin again.

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:18.420
 "Do you mind just keeping these?"

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:19.380
 And he kept them.

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:21.740
 Other people who were there say that he went in

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:24.540
 and nicked all the stuff and hung onto it.

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:26.460
 But then his grandson returned it.

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:29.100
 It was the 1890s and he went to the Prince of Wales

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:30.660
 and said, "Well, look, we've got these bits

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:32.460
 "of Charles I, do you want them?"

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:34.940
 - The story, the QI facts that we always say

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:38.620
 about this is that they used the vertebrae as a salt holder.

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:40.220
 - Oh, really?

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:41.940
 - Yeah, so if you ever went for dinner

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:45.220
 at Sir Henry Hulford's house and you wanted some salt,

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:46.380
 it would be a little dish,

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:47.540
 but when you looked at it closely,

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:49.140
 it would be part of his backbone.

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:50.340
 - Wow. - That's,

00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:52.220
 and you can fit that in a cupboard.

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:54.740
 (all laughing)

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:57.100
 - The eventual outcomes for the regicides

00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:59.260
 who were the people who'd signed the death warrant,

00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:00.940
 basically, were bad.

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:02.620
 So I think a lot of them are disemboweled.

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:03.460
 - They're bad.

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:04.300
 - They were not good.

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:05.140
 - They were courted.

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:07.140
 - They were, yeah, hanged until not quite dead

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:08.940
 and then had the genitals removed

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:10.740
 and then were disemboweled.

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:11.580
 - Still alive, still conscious.

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:13.740
 - While still alive, got to the lie.

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:16.740
 But if you got away, then it could be okay.

00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:20.620
 And interestingly, if you live in Connecticut near,

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:22.180
 I think in New Haven,

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:25.340
 then there are three streets called Dixwell Avenue,

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:27.460
 a Wally Avenue and Goff Street.

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:28.300
 - Dixwell.

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:29.300
 - Dixwell and Wally.

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:30.140
 - Wally.

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:30.980
 - And what was the other one?

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:32.300
 - Dixwell, Wally and Goff.

00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:33.420
 (all laughing)

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:37.620
 - They were the worst surveyors that I ever had for life.

00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:38.660
 - But Wally and Goff are the two

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:40.540
 that are in this book, Active Oblivion.

00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:41.380
 - Are they?

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:42.940
 - Dixwell was the doubt, apparently.

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:44.300
 (all laughing)

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:45.820
 - Well, they all ended up in this place

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:47.420
 and they liked them so much in America,

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:49.260
 obviously, 'cause America aren't that pro monarchy,

00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:50.620
 that they named these streets after them.

00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:53.340
 - Yeah, they were in very, very religious,

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:54.540
 puritanical communities,

00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:56.660
 which were already very uncertain about monarchy

00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:57.500
 and wanted development.

00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:58.940
 - It was kind of the place where they could go,

00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:00.380
 wasn't it, when they were safe?

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:01.860
 There was another place in North America

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:03.900
 named after someone connected to this story.

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:08.020
 So the wife of Charles I was Henrietta Marie.

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:11.500
 She was a French Catholic princess.

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:15.820
 She got married by proxy, which is quite cool.

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:19.020
 So Charles I wasn't there when she got married.

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:21.220
 So he had a proxy who was George Villiers,

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:22.980
 the first Duke of Buckingham,

00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:24.860
 but George Villiers wasn't available either.

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:28.260
 So they got another proxie, her name was Charles de Lorraine,

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:31.140
 who was the Duke of Chavres.

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:33.300
 And basically, they got married

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:35.300
 with this guy pretending to be the king.

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:36.740
 And in those days, you could do that.

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:37.940
 - I think we've said before, haven't we?

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:40.100
 There were various rituals, if you marry a proxie,

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:42.020
 like you, as the proxy would,

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:44.460
 maybe have to touch the person's thigh.

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:45.300
 I think that happened.

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:46.980
 - You have to lie in bed and touch the thigh.

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:48.820
 - Lie in bed and be witness with them.

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:49.660
 Yeah, yeah.

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:53.580
 - So the king only met his wife three months later at Dover.

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:56.540
 So they'd been married for three months when he met her.

00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:57.380
 - That's so funny.

00:25:57.380 --> 00:26:00.060
 - And one of these areas in North America

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:02.300
 where Catholics felt safe where they could go

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:04.820
 was named after Henrietta Marie,

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:09.820
 and it was Maryland, or Maryland, or Maryland.

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:11.500
 And we always say this name,

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:13.460
 and we always pronounce it wrong on this podcast,

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:15.860
 and the people of Maryland always write to us.

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:17.980
 But now I actually think that because it's named

00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:21.380
 after Henrietta Marie, it should be called Marie-Land.

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:22.220
 - Yeah.

00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:23.980
 - So that's why I will be covering it from now on.

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:24.820
 - Excellent, very nice.

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:27.460
 - Especially because she didn't like Mary, actually.

00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:29.780
 'Cause she was French, and she was very French.

00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:30.980
 And she was beginning English.

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:32.180
 She didn't like being called Mary.

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:34.460
 - So the English used to call her Mary as like a micknail.

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:35.940
 - And she said, no, I'm French.

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:36.780
 Mary's not my name.

00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:38.500
 I don't even like the name Mary, fair enough.

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:41.020
 Mary is a better name than Mary, I-M-O.

00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:42.860
 - Can we talk a bit about the execution itself?

00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:44.460
 Why is it such an interesting,

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:46.100
 I mean, what an extraordinary,

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:47.900
 I mean, one of the weirdest days ever to happen

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:49.100
 in English history, you know?

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:51.500
 It was on whiteboard, it was not far from here.

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:57.780
 So when it happened, the executioner had to wear a disguise,

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:00.580
 because the executioner's never been identified for sure.

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:02.540
 - Do you not just mean like a hud?

00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:03.380
 - No, I don't.

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:07.340
 I mean a wig, a fake beard, a sailor's costume.

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:08.420
 - Yeah, confusing details here.

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:11.780
 - I'm clear as to why, and fishnets over the face.

00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:12.620
 - Okay.

00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:13.460
 - So afterwards, after the restoration,

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:16.340
 there was a big manhunt for who was the exact executioner,

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:17.580
 'cause we're gonna kill him.

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:19.820
 - There must have been a lot of sailors

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:22.980
 getting rid of their fishnets just in case they can't.

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:25.900
 - Well, the executioner was never properly identified.

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:27.380
 One guy was sentenced to death for it,

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:28.740
 but then the sentence was overturned.

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:30.020
 - And one guy claimed to be,

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:33.260
 and then wrote that they can't remember about that.

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:34.100
 - There's a museum in London

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:36.660
 that has a few of these relics from the execution,

00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:38.940
 including a shirt that belonged to Charles the First,

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:39.940
 that they believe.

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:42.120
 You know, they can't actually work out properly,

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:45.460
 but all his bits of clothing was sort of torn off him,

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:46.780
 and handed round and orchid.

00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:47.860
 - That's the museum of London, isn't it?

00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:49.060
 - The museum of London, yeah.

00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:51.740
 And among those items, they have a patched leather shoe

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:53.220
 of a man called John Big,

00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:55.060
 and they believe that Big was the executioner.

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:57.220
 At least that's one of the theories.

00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:58.060
 - Okay, Mr. Big.

00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:00.380
 - Mr. Big, yeah.

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:03.060
 - That's what that whole thing, it was an analogy.

00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:04.740
 - The Sex and the City character, Mr. Big.

00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:06.780
 - It was an analogy for the English Civil War.

00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:08.660
 - Yeah, that's very interesting.

00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:09.700
 - Can't believe you didn't see that.

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:12.820
 - So I guess, I guess, what's our name is it, Carrie?

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:13.660
 - Guess it.

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:14.980
 - Carrie Fishnet, Carrie Fishnet.

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:16.340
 But they thought that would be too obvious.

00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:17.180
 - Oh my God.

00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:18.780
 - I don't think it's Carrie Fishnet.

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:19.620
 - Is she called Carrie Bradshaw?

00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:21.000
 - Oh, Carrie Fishnet is a different person, isn't it?

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:21.820
 - I think it's Carrie Bradshaw.

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:24.340
 - She called Carrie Bradshaw, well, interestingly,

00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:27.380
 John Bradshaw was the parliamentary commissioner

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:30.140
 who tried Charles I in Westminster at all.

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:30.980
 - You are joking.

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:31.800
 - No.

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:33.420
 - I can't believe we're actually blowing this shit wide.

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:34.540
 (laughing)

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:35.380
 - This is huge.

00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:36.220
 - Bradshaw and Big.

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:38.420
 - If any of us had ever properly watched Sex and the City,

00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:40.260
 we'd be all over it right now.

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:42.840
 (upbeat music)

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:48.340
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:50.100
 and that is Anna.

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:52.540
 - My fact this week is that in World War II,

00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:55.940
 a Finnish soldier got tired in the Arctic,

00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:57.580
 so took the entire platoons,

00:28:57.580 --> 00:28:59.540
 rations of methamphetamine,

00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:03.180
 and subsequently skied 400 kilometers to safety.

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:04.180
 (laughing)

00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:05.020
 - It's extraordinary.

00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:07.060
 - It's the power of uppers.

00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:09.540
 - It's insane the story.

00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:11.460
 - It's a really insane story.

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:15.260
 So this is a chap called Aimo Koyvanen,

00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:19.140
 and it was a time when Finland was all with the Soviet Union.

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:20.860
 It was mid-Second World War.

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:22.420
 Finland was sort of on Germany's side,

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:25.980
 all with the Soviet Union, and he's fighting

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:29.420
 in this very cold area with his platoon,

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:31.820
 and he had been tasked with keeping

00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:36.100
 his entire group supply of pervitin, which is meth.

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:38.300
 And it was so crucial in the Second World War,

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:39.460
 everyone was bloody taking it,

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:42.180
 and he was really, really tired,

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:44.500
 and I think the Soviets were coming and chasing them,

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:47.900
 and he was told to lead them to make tracks

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:49.820
 and lead them away so they could escape.

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:51.860
 And he was at the front,

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:54.580
 and he said in his memory of it that,

00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:55.940
 so plausible.

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:57.140
 (laughing)

00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:58.540
 He said, especially 'cause first of all he said,

00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:00.540
 I didn't wanna take them 'cause I was kind of against that,

00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:02.580
 I disapproved of drugs, so I tried not to,

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:04.420
 but then I got so knackered that,

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:06.660
 look, I just tipped a pill into my hand,

00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:08.860
 what I hoped was a pill, but I was wearing mittens,

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:10.820
 and so quite a few came out,

00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:13.260
 turns out all 30 of the pills came out,

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:15.660
 and then because he wanted to hide

00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:17.380
 what he was doing from his comrades,

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:18.660
 he just ate them all.

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:19.500
 (laughing)

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:21.140
 - You're being shot at, it's stressful.

00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:24.660
 - I'm just, I'm just gonna have all the tic-tacs basically.

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:25.500
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:27.700
 - If you pour a lot of tic-tacs in your hands,

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:30.380
 let's say you only want two, but accidentally rive come out,

00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:31.820
 you're not gonna put them back in the tic-tac.

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:32.660
 - Exactly.

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:33.980
 - Especially if you're being shot at.

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:34.820
 - You're being shot at.

00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:37.500
 - As I usually am when I eat tic-tacs.

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:39.940
 - Just drop them in the snow, anything.

00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:43.100
 - And then it goes Sonic the Hedgehog, 'cause suddenly,

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:43.940
 - I don't, I was thinking--

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:44.780
 - He just eats this.

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:46.980
 - I was thinking of Popeye when Popeye had just finished,

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:49.300
 (laughing)

00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:54.300
 suddenly turned into a mutant absolute, like, yeah.

00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:59.300
 He basically, as it goes, he received the hit in one swoop,

00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:02.940
 and the hit, by the way, lasts for a very long time.

00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:04.540
 - When you take a normal amount of meth,

00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:06.620
 it can last a few days, so I think--

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:09.340
 - He took an OD level of it, is what they say right.

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:12.140
 And I figure that the OD level would come to you in one hit.

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:14.460
 This kind of just plays out over a number of days,

00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:16.940
 and he goes speeding away, and they're trying to,

00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:18.860
 they're trying to chase him, and they eventually--

00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:20.100
 - He's collected all his rings.

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:21.020
 (laughing)

00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:23.820
 - And they can't keep up, and the music goes really fast,

00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:26.380
 and they're chasing him still, and he's just going off,

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:28.420
 and then this is the craziest bit,

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:30.260
 which presumably you've got more on, Anna,

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:32.420
 'cause I just couldn't believe it, so I stopped reading.

00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:33.660
 He blacks out.

00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:35.220
 (laughing)

00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:38.340
 He blacks out, and keeps going.

00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:41.500
 - Basically, a few days later, he kind of was like,

00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:42.340
 "Oh, where am I?"

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:43.180
 - Yeah.

00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:44.020
 - And it turned out they'd been doing that.

00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:47.660
 (laughing)

00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:49.700
 - He may have collapsed multiple times on the way.

00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:51.300
 Basically, one of the things I found surprising

00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:53.660
 in his account is that he said,

00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:55.100
 "You felt amazing for a bit."

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:56.060
 Quite a short time, I think,

00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:57.660
 where he'd speed like something, the hedgehog,

00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:00.260
 and then he said, "Something very unexpected happened.

00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:01.580
 "I completely lost the plot

00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:03.380
 "and started hallucinating and collapsing.

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:04.540
 "I would say that's not unexpected

00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:07.260
 "if you have taken 30 pills of Beth."

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:09.780
 But then, the mystery is what happened

00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:11.500
 to the people with him, and I think,

00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:13.100
 'cause what proceeded this was actually

00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:15.300
 an argument between him and his men.

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:17.780
 And he blacks out, and the next thing he remembers,

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:20.420
 he wakes up and he's completely on his own.

00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:22.700
 So, one sort of suspects, they had a chat

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:24.900
 and said, "This guy's been so annoying right now.

00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:26.460
 "He's a massive liability."

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:28.220
 - Post-meth, post-him-taking of the pills.

00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:29.060
 - Post-meth, yeah.

00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:31.260
 Well, they took all his ammunition off him, didn't they?

00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:32.300
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:35.460
 And his food supplies, so he woke up and had nothing.

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:37.540
 - Well, then he started skiing towards,

00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:39.460
 he saw some allies in the distance

00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:40.620
 and started skiing towards them,

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:42.500
 much too late, realized he's their Russians.

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:43.340
 - Yeah.

00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:44.860
 - But he's still got the drugs on him.

00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:48.300
 - He skis through them and past them, keeps going.

00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:49.540
 - He said they were so confused,

00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:51.260
 they just moved, they should have shot him,

00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:52.340
 and they just moved their legs out

00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:53.820
 the way to let him get past.

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:56.060
 - Excuse me, he spent all night

00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:57.580
 trying to get to a distant farm window,

00:32:57.580 --> 00:32:59.500
 which turned out to be the North Star.

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:02.100
 (laughing)

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:03.900
 - And then, he survived, didn't he,

00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:07.700
 by chewing on some tree, like a cactus-style?

00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:10.780
 - He boiled pine needles at one point,

00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:14.700
 so he still had delicious pine tea, had some pine tea,

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:16.220
 but he was really starving.

00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:17.620
 It was only at the very end

00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:20.180
 where he somehow had found a hut,

00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:22.060
 finally there's cabin in the woods,

00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:23.620
 and first of all, it's so funny.

00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:25.380
 He says, "I lit a fire in the middle of the cabin."

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:27.420
 It's still clearly high, so didn't know

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:28.460
 what he was doing, lit a fire in the middle

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:30.980
 of a wooden cabin, and it just set fire to the cabin.

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:32.660
 And he said, "I just sat next to the fire

00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:35.060
 "and followed it around as it burned the cabin down,

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:37.700
 "gradually, the whole cabin collapsed around him."

00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:40.380
 - How many days into the trip,

00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:41.420
 and I mean the trip?

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:42.820
 - Well, he just doesn't know.

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:44.860
 I think about five days, but he has no idea.

00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:46.340
 He only realized when he came out of it,

00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:47.620
 it had been two weeks.

00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:50.820
 And yeah, on his last day, he was about to starve to death,

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:53.780
 and a J flew past, and he whacked it with a ski pole,

00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:55.420
 and ate a raw J.

00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:57.900
 - Again, not the actions of someone

00:33:57.900 --> 00:33:58.740
 who's completely with it.

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:02.340
 I mean, the ability to beat a bird out of the sky is unusual.

00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:03.660
 - It was a stick, that's hard though.

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:04.500
 - It was a stick.

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:06.780
 - Those ski poles are quite thin.

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:08.140
 - People don't go on pheasant shoots

00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:08.980
 with just a ski pole, do they?

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:11.020
 - No, they're pros, yeah, yeah.

00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:12.620
 Was this before or after he got blown up?

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:13.460
 Sorry.

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:14.300
 - That was after.

00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:16.420
 - Oh yeah, that's right.

00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:18.460
 - So he was sat on fire, and then he was blown up,

00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:19.700
 and then he had the J, right?

00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:20.860
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:23.860
 'Cause he found another little building,

00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:26.020
 and so it was a German post,

00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:27.860
 but the Germans had retreated from it,

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:30.900
 and they had attached mines to it.

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:33.540
 So he basically shredded his entire foot

00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:35.180
 in the first explosion,

00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:36.860
 and then he sort of hopped around,

00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:40.780
 and he opened a door, and then that was also mined,

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:43.420
 and supposedly he came to about, you know,

00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:45.340
 many meters away, he'd been blasted across,

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:47.100
 but he was still holding the door lock,

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:47.940
 like in a cartoon.

00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:49.700
 (laughing)

00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:51.940
 - Yeah, it's the most extraordinary story.

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:52.940
 - Do we think true?

00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:54.580
 - I can't imagine any of it's true,

00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:57.020
 I think he was sitting at home.

00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:59.140
 - Because we knew he was anti-drugs, right?

00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:00.580
 Maybe he's come up with all this

00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:02.140
 of his adult dude drug stuff.

00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:05.100
 - Oh, this is like a finished 40s talk to Frank thing.

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:06.300
 - Yes.

00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:08.900
 - I think we know, 'cause we know from his associates

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:10.940
 that the first bit happened and the last bit happened,

00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:12.220
 but I suppose the only account we have

00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:14.100
 of the in-between bit is his.

00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:15.940
 - With a guy with a lot of drugs in his body,

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:17.100
 that's all we've got.

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:18.980
 - But he must have had a shredded foot, right?

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:19.820
 - Yeah, yeah, the blown off first.

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:20.900
 - And he must have been holding a doorknob.

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:22.620
 (laughing)

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:25.020
 - Must have had a bloody ski pole with him.

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:26.060
 - Oh, dead Jane.

00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:27.460
 - He just kind of looked at all these things,

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:30.540
 like, right, I'm gonna have to make a story up about these.

00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:31.820
 - But anyway, somehow he made it,

00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:34.820
 I mean, eventually he was found by his allies,

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:36.740
 who were the Germans or the Finnish,

00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:39.060
 and taken to hospital and--

00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:41.900
 - Apparently his heart rate was still 200 beats per minute

00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:43.380
 at that stage. - God, it's a lot.

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:44.220
 - It's a lot.

00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:45.340
 - It's incredible he lived.

00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:46.420
 - It's extraordinary. - And then he drove

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:47.460
 to the ripe old age, you know,

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:50.260
 who just wore it in the '70s and then, yeah.

00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:51.540
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:54.460
 - Anyway, he was mad, but the use of meth was,

00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:55.540
 it was big, wasn't it?

00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:57.220
 The Germans were particularly into it.

00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:58.300
 - Yeah.

00:35:58.300 --> 00:35:59.460
 - But everyone did it.

00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:01.460
 - Well, I was reading you could get these pills

00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:04.020
 called Forced March, which were quite common,

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:05.580
 even like at the start of the 20th century.

00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:09.900
 So they were a blend of cocaine and caffeine.

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:11.260
 I mean, I don't know why you need a caffeine

00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:12.620
 at the point where you've had all the cocaine,

00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:16.540
 but it was basically, it was sold publicly,

00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:17.540
 it was sold by the Wellcome, actually,

00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:20.060
 or by Burrow's Wellcome, who was one of the Wellcome family.

00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:20.900
 - Oh, really?

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:23.100
 - It was a pharmaceutical family there, yeah.

00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:23.940
 - Yeah, they took them to the,

00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:26.580
 on the Antarctic Expeditions, the Forced March.

00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:28.500
 - Yeah, cocaine, opium. - Yeah, Scott and Shackleton,

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:29.980
 but they took specifically Forced March,

00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:33.100
 which I think they've got to market it in a gentle way,

00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:34.620
 or maybe that's what you want is Forced March.

00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:36.260
 - I think that's what you need in motivation, right?

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:37.100
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:37.940
 - I can't march anymore.

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:38.780
 - Yeah, yeah, right.

00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:40.260
 - I've had some Forced March.

00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:41.100
 And did they use that,

00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:42.620
 'cause they use that, the Germans use that in the war.

00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:46.260
 Did the Brits use that as well, and the Allies generally?

00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:47.100
 - I think the Allies,

00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:50.020
 I think there was meth use all around, yeah, yeah.

00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:52.340
 The meth pills that were synthesized in the 30s.

00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:54.860
 - But maybe not for everybody, for people who,

00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:55.900
 I mean, obviously not for everybody,

00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:58.100
 but you know, as in maybe it would be for pilots,

00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:00.060
 rather than for standard...

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:01.940
 - I think it was pilots to stay awake.

00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:03.900
 I think that's why the Allies use it, for sure.

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:04.740
 - That's so interesting.

00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:05.580
 - So off the back of this,

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:07.020
 I was just looking into supplies

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:08.380
 that you take in the Arctic,

00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:11.020
 as in what you have to keep you going.

00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:17.500
 And, I mean, it seems like it was either cocaine or biscuits.

00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:20.220
 I said, no, it's like...

00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:22.500
 - It sounds like a student's fantasy, doesn't it?

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:23.340
 - Yeah, you're right.

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:24.180
 - What's on offer today?

00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:25.020
 - Same.

00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:26.940
 - So, get this, Captain Scott, right?

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:30.180
 Scott of the Antarctic did loads of expeditions there.

00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:33.540
 He took some specially made biscuits,

00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:35.340
 which were glucose enriched,

00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:37.340
 and they're made by a firm called Huntley and Palmer.

00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:41.220
 But he set off with digestive, rich tea,

00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:45.460
 piti beurre, fancy lunch, ginger nuts,

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:49.140
 as well as emergency Antarctic and small captain biscuits.

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:49.980
 And later in his trip,

00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:52.260
 he got resupplied with more biscuits.

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:54.700
 - I actually think that they're some of the worst biscuits

00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:57.220
 you've just named, like digestives and rich tea.

00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:58.540
 Where's the... - Rich tea, ginger nuts.

00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:00.780
 - The jammie dodger. - Jammie dodger, come on.

00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:03.020
 - Well, tragically, this was a pre-jammie dodger world.

00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:05.860
 I mean, maybe he would have made it back if he had to.

00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:09.060
 - On the first all-female expedition to the North Pole,

00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:13.020
 every woman involved eight four penguins per day.

00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:13.860
 - Wow.

00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:15.180
 - They don't have penguins, do they?

00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:17.780
 - They brought penguins from the Antarctic to the Arctic

00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:19.700
 solely to mince them up and eat them.

00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:20.540
 - Yeah, they're cruel,

00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:23.500
 and that's why they haven't sent women back to the North Pole.

00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:25.940
 This is, of course, biscuit penguins.

00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:27.300
 They were sponsored by McVitie's.

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:31.460
 And so, McVitie's provided them with the hot nail down number,

00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:33.540
 maybe, but thousands of penguins, I believe,

00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:34.740
 and one of the women said they were told

00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:35.980
 to eat four penguins a day.

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:38.100
 - Interesting, according to the biography,

00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:41.300
 Frigid Women by Sue Richards and Victoria Richards.

00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:42.620
 - That's brilliant.

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:44.420
 - So this was two of the women who went on it.

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:46.980
 They were given six biscuits per person per day

00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:48.100
 for the expedition.

00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:48.940
 - Oh, really?

00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:50.020
 Maybe the person who I read,

00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:52.460
 they got their biscuits nicks before they gave them to her.

00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:54.260
 - Yeah, that comes to yet.

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:55.540
 - Interesting, because that many,

00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:57.220
 it must have been loads of days they were traveling.

00:38:57.220 --> 00:38:58.660
 - It was, it was a relay,

00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:01.100
 so it meant that four women at a time were going,

00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:02.540
 and then they would be airlifted out,

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:03.780
 and the next slot would be airlifted

00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:05.220
 into wherever they were.

00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:06.260
 - That's cool.

00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:07.100
 - Yeah.

00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:08.340
 - I was thinking you could wear the biscuits

00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:10.140
 as a kind of extra layer of warmth,

00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:11.660
 but maybe not. - Wear the biscuits?

00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:12.940
 - Well, it's like you could make it,

00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:14.020
 'cause they're quite flat, aren't they?

00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:16.940
 They're kind of a waistcoat that was lined with penguins.

00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:18.460
 - And actually, they're two biscuits,

00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:21.100
 and in between there's like a little bit of chocolate

00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:21.940
 or something, right?

00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:23.260
 - Well, insulation, I'm thinking.

00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:24.100
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:25.780
 - It just sounds like you're one of the members on the trip

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:27.740
 who misheard wearing the biscuits,

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:29.780
 and you've emerged covered in penguins.

00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:30.780
 - What year was this, by the way?

00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:34.260
 - It was 1997, and so I've got a question for you.

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:37.020
 Remembering that it's 1997, and they're British,

00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:39.980
 and thinking what was happening in 1997 at the time,

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:42.980
 what do you think the newspapers nicknamed them?

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:43.820
 - The hand-owners.

00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:44.660
 - The hand-owners.

00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:46.380
 - Blair's frozen women.

00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:48.900
 - Go away from politics.

00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:51.020
 - Oh, the spice girls were big.

00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:51.860
 - Ah.

00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:52.940
 - And they were in the Arctic.

00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:53.780
 - Yeah, so.

00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:55.060
 - Cold, frozen spices?

00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:56.820
 - No, no, no.

00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:59.300
 - Wait, wait, say it again, say the ingredients.

00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:00.580
 - The spice girls were big.

00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:01.420
 - Yep.

00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:02.500
 - Girl power, girl power.

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:03.820
 - They're going to the North Pole.

00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:04.660
 What nicknamed them?

00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:05.900
 - Girl polar, girl polar.

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:07.380
 - Ziggazig Arctic.

00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:08.220
 - Jesus Christ.

00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:09.060
 - Girl polar.

00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:10.620
 - Wanna be the North Poles.

00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:11.460
 - No.

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:14.460
 - To become, 16 become, no, two.

00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:17.580
 - Literally everyone listening has got this.

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:19.980
 - Okay, okay, well done everyone.

00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:21.340
 - What do you get of the Arctic?

00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:22.180
 - Snow.

00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:23.220
 - As well as snow.

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:24.060
 - Ice.

00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:24.900
 - Icey spice.

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:25.740
 - Ice girls.

00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:27.220
 - The ice girls.

00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:28.060
 - Woohoo.

00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:30.380
 - Pew, pew, pew.

00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:31.220
 - Ice one down.

00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:33.780
 - Wow, straight away, straight in there.

00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:35.660
 - Sonic, Sonic Shriver.

00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:36.980
 - That's incredible.

00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:39.420
 - And one of the patrons of the ice girls

00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:41.780
 was Dawn French, the comedian.

00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:42.620
 - Yeah.

00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:45.340
 - And she told the press that she'd actually made the cut

00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:49.100
 to be on the expedition, but she decided to stay at home

00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:50.900
 and comfort all the husbands.

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:51.740
 (laughing)

00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:53.940
 - That's so good, I'm sure you know that.

00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:56.620
 - One of the husbands dumped his wife while she was out there.

00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:57.900
 - Oh, while she was out there?

00:40:57.900 --> 00:40:58.740
 - Yeah.

00:40:58.740 --> 00:40:59.580
 - She's married to Dawn French now.

00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:00.740
 (laughing)

00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:01.860
 - What, was it Lenny Henry?

00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:02.940
 - It was, yeah.

00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:05.820
 No, this was Anne who had triplets

00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:07.220
 and she'd never had any experience before.

00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:08.540
 She's this amazing explorer now.

00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:09.380
 - And Daniels, yeah.

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:11.100
 - And Daniels, never done anything before.

00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:13.220
 But she, when they finished the expedition,

00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:15.340
 all the other women had letters from home

00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:16.460
 and she didn't have one

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:18.540
 and it was a sign that her husband had decided to go on.

00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:19.860
 - Oh my gosh.

00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:22.100
 - I was talking to you about Rosie Stancer.

00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:22.940
 - Is she one of the--

00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:25.300
 - There's one of the arctic,

00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:27.060
 one of the frigid women, as the book has it.

00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:28.580
 So she was on it.

00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:29.820
 So get this, she's,

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:32.740
 I think she's quite posh, like her--

00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:33.580
 - Ash ice.

00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:35.540
 - Posh ice, brilliant.

00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:36.980
 - Brilliant.

00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:39.020
 - So she, like Anne Daniels,

00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:40.460
 she went on to do a lot of other expeditions.

00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:42.460
 She did one, the Snickers South Pole Solo

00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:43.740
 and the Mars North Pole Solo.

00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:45.700
 So these are all chocolate and biscuit sponsored.

00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:50.300
 But her grandfather was also a wannabe, thank you, explorer.

00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:52.540
 He was the fourth Earl of Granville, right?

00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:54.140
 And he wanted to be a polar explorer,

00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:55.300
 but he was thwarted.

00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:56.220
 Can you guess why?

00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:57.980
 It was something about his body.

00:41:57.980 --> 00:42:00.420
 - He had a weird sort of inner ear thing,

00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:03.220
 but whenever he wanted to go north, he always went south.

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:06.100
 - That's a very creative one, better than what I've got.

00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:06.940
 Shall I tell you?

00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:07.780
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:09.260
 - He was too tall.

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:10.100
 - Did he?

00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:10.940
 - To go on an arctic--

00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:12.260
 - Could you hit your head on the top of the earth?

00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:14.140
 (laughing)

00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:16.260
 - 'Cause he wouldn't fit in the tent.

00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:17.820
 He was too tall for the tent.

00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:19.260
 - So his feet would be sticking out.

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:20.780
 - Yeah, and that would obviously kill

00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:22.340
 all the men in the tent with the cold.

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:25.980
 - Could he not do like the kind of, the embryo position?

00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:26.900
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:29.060
 - He was, he was, I mean, maybe this was an excuse

00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:29.980
 and it was his personality,

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:33.380
 but he thought he was too tall to fit in the expedition tent.

00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:35.140
 - I thought he was five foot eight.

00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:36.260
 - No, no, too tall.

00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:38.100
 - Could you get a bigger tent?

00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:38.940
 - No!

00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:40.260
 - No, they don't exist.

00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:43.420
 My cob knobs bring something that doesn't exist, mate.

00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:44.260
 - I can't believe you just called

00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:45.580
 the feet all possessed in the embryo position.

00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:46.420
 - I know, I can't remember.

00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:47.260
 - The embryo position.

00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:48.100
 - Yeah.

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:48.940
 - We've got a phrase for that.

00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:51.100
 (laughing)

00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:52.420
 - So I read a story which is that

00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:54.580
 and Daniel's mother triplets,

00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:56.420
 one of her things to keep her going

00:42:56.420 --> 00:43:00.140
 was to just say her kid's names over and over again.

00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:02.380
 How loud the triplets just repeat their names.

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:03.220
 - Baby ice.

00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:05.860
 (laughing)

00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:08.140
 - But they had very near death experiences.

00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:08.980
 It was so hairy.

00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:09.820
 - Scary ice.

00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:10.940
 (laughing)

00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:11.780
 - Jesus.

00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:12.620
 (laughing)

00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:13.980
 - Okay, now we just cross off three.

00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:15.420
 We've got two more to get, yeah.

00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:18.140
 Done posh, we've done scary, and we've done baby.

00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:19.340
 So that leaves sporty and ginger.

00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:20.500
 - Sporty and ginger.

00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:22.380
 - Wait, oh they didn't take ginger nuts.

00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:23.220
 They took the penguins.

00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:24.060
 - Yeah.

00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:24.900
 - Damn it.

00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:25.740
 - They're all sporty.

00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:26.580
 - Okay.

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:27.500
 - But yeah, the mother daughter,

00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:28.740
 the daughter rung her mom to say,

00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:30.740
 "Hey, I'm doing this Arctic expedition."

00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:32.980
 And the mom says, her daughter invited her,

00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:35.740
 the daughter says, she definitely didn't invite her mom,

00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:37.060
 but her mom decided to go.

00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:39.140
 But they both fell through the ice at one point.

00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:40.340
 So the Arctic moves.

00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:42.460
 They didn't quite realize how much when you're exploring,

00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:45.140
 it shifts and moves and the ice was creaking

00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:48.100
 and they're wearing skis and they both fell through the ice

00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:50.340
 and had to like swim in the skis.

00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:51.180
 - What?

00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:52.220
 - And she said she just remembered,

00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:54.420
 while also towing these supply wagons,

00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:56.420
 they all had a supply wagon they had to tow behind them.

00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:57.260
 - And they survived?

00:43:57.260 --> 00:43:58.660
 - Yeah, they somehow survived.

00:43:58.660 --> 00:43:59.500
 Incredibly.

00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:02.500
 But then it sounds like God was watching

00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:05.220
 'cause they ended up, two of them ended up

00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:07.620
 managing to climb out onto one side of the ice,

00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:09.180
 but their group was on the other.

00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:11.060
 So they were on either side of a river

00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:12.660
 and they just walked either side of this river

00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:14.380
 and they were getting more and more divergent

00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:15.980
 and they realized they were not gonna be able

00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:17.300
 to get back to each other.

00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:20.140
 And then suddenly the ice started moving

00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:23.540
 and the river closed up and the ice joined together.

00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:24.380
 - Wow.

00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:25.380
 - But it would have been very precarious

00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:27.380
 as in to walk across that is quite nerve wracking.

00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:28.940
 You would have had to tread.

00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:32.100
 You would have had to walk quite gingerly, spice.

00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:32.940
 Ice, ice.

00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:36.540
 James saw that coming from such a distance.

00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:39.860
 - What's that on the horizon?

00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:41.180
 Is it the North Pole?

00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:43.260
 No, is that these junk?

00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:47.060
 - Oh, it doesn't feel as good when you get there.

00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:50.640
 (upbeat music)

00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:56.660
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show

00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:57.980
 and that is my fact.

00:44:57.980 --> 00:45:01.620
 My fact this week is that the crowd science expert

00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:04.500
 who designed and mapped out the cue

00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:07.580
 is called Professor Keith Still.

00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:10.420
 - Did you try and say keep?

00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:11.420
 It sounds like keep.

00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:13.380
 - So his name's Keith Still.

00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:14.460
 It looks like keep still.

00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:16.180
 Would you say it in a weird way?

00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:17.820
 - What's the cues do?

00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:19.660
 They moved, I think.

00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:21.980
 - But this one famously was a very long one

00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:24.740
 that required you to keep still.

00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:26.820
 - Actually we tried to keep walking for about five months.

00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:28.940
 - It did, but what were you doing when you weren't walking?

00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:30.940
 - I suppose you would keep still.

00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:31.780
 - That's right.

00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:33.700
 - They always say keep still.

00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:36.260
 - This is the cue for Elizabeth II.

00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:37.940
 - This is the passing of the queen.

00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:39.860
 There was this extraordinary cue

00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:42.900
 that lasted somewhere between five miles onwards.

00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:44.380
 And if you were in it,

00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:45.700
 if you were someone who came to London

00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:46.540
 to be part of it,

00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:48.500
 you could be waiting between nine and 24 hours

00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:50.420
 to eventually get to the front of the cue.

00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:54.860
 - Professor Keith Still is someone who helps.

00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:55.700
 - You could say his name normally,

00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:57.020
 now we've done the facts.

00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:58.180
 - We've explained the joke,

00:45:58.180 --> 00:45:59.300
 which always works.

00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:01.060
 Now let's just call him by his name.

00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:03.900
 - So he is from Burton and Kendall in Cumbria

00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:06.100
 and his job is a crowd scientist.

00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:07.780
 So for the last 30 years,

00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:09.860
 he's been doing this as a job

00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:12.700
 and he was the person who was in charge of creating

00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:15.220
 a line that was gonna be one that meant

00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:16.220
 that people felt safe

00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:18.820
 and that they had toilet stops along the way.

00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:21.500
 And he had to, and you know, medical assistants

00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:23.260
 and he had to devise it for something

00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:24.380
 that was twice the length.

00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:25.220
 - Where would it have come?

00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:26.060
 - I don't know.

00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:26.900
 I'm not sure if we were ever--

00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:27.740
 - Into the English Channel.

00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:29.820
 When you dropped it into the English Channel.

00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:31.300
 - Because they did stop it at one point,

00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:32.420
 they said we're at capacity.

00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:34.380
 So they didn't use the proposed route.

00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:35.700
 But then what they had was a pen

00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:37.380
 where a sort of secondary cue started

00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:39.180
 where you could then go from that second cue.

00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:40.020
 - Cue for the cue.

00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:41.500
 - Cue for the cue, exactly.

00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:44.340
 - God, yeah, I remember that happened.

00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:46.540
 I didn't go clubbing very much as a student.

00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:48.180
 - You're a stonisher now.

00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:49.900
 - No, no, no, it's true.

00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:51.100
 But there was, I think partly

00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:52.860
 because one of the first times I went--

00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:56.020
 - Your friends said you were too tall, didn't they?

00:46:56.020 --> 00:46:58.580
 - Yeah, apparently the club had a very low ceiling.

00:46:58.580 --> 00:46:59.920
 - They always do, yeah.

00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:02.180
 - Yeah, I would have hated it.

00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:04.000
 No, there was a club called The Bridge,

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.940
 which was you'd go to.

00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:09.180
 And there was a, you'd cue up for ages

00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:10.300
 and I did cue up for ages.

00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:11.700
 And then you get into, I got in

00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:13.180
 and it turned out that the club I got into

00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:15.220
 was actually a cue for the actual club.

00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:16.060
 - No.

00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:17.580
 - Yeah, there was this whole,

00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:18.780
 and it had a bar and everything,

00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:20.660
 but it was basically the cue for The Bridge

00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:22.060
 as in you get given a ticket

00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:23.340
 and when they called out certain tickets

00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:24.740
 you could go into the actual club.

00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:25.740
 But I cue for about 40 minutes

00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:27.420
 to get into the cue club, which was rubbish.

00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:28.340
 - You must feel like an absolute chump.

00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:29.700
 I've been to The Bridge multiple times.

00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:32.140
 I don't remember the old double cue.

00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:34.300
 - Oh well, Anna probably walks up to the front

00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:35.500
 and says, "I'm Anna Szczenski."

00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:37.100
 - Yeah, they let me in the back hugely.

00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:38.860
 - And you're DJing, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:40.860
 (laughing)

00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:44.660
 - It is actually quite impressive the level of standing.

00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:47.260
 So I hadn't really thought about the fact

00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:49.220
 that you would be actually standing up

00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:50.180
 'cause you are constantly moving,

00:47:50.180 --> 00:47:51.220
 so you can't really sit down.

00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:52.580
 You were standing up for 24 hours.

00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:55.100
 And lots of people needed medical treatment.

00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:57.820
 291 people needed medical assistance

00:47:57.820 --> 00:48:00.580
 just on one day with 17 having to go to hospital.

00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:02.060
 - No man, it's a lot.

00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:03.660
 - Dehydrating and fainting, it is quite a lot.

00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:05.980
 - Of course they could have just not had a cue.

00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:07.780
 I mean, these days we do have systems

00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:09.180
 to stop people from having to cue

00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:11.060
 for miles and miles and miles.

00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:12.020
 - What, like booking in?

00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:13.860
 - Yeah, you could have just gone on the website,

00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:16.860
 said, "I'm gonna come between one o'clock and two o'clock."

00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:19.340
 And then the cue would never have gotten longer than an hour.

00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:20.340
 - Why is the fun in that?

00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:22.100
 What would the news have done for a week?

00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:23.140
 - That's the point, isn't it?

00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:25.460
 The point is that it's like this ceremonial thing

00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:26.900
 that they wanted to show how much,

00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:28.100
 how important it was and stuff.

00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:29.100
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:31.340
 - Professor Still, Keith Still.

00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:34.140
 (laughing)

00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:37.060
 He got into queuing, first of all, several decades ago.

00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:39.620
 He was at a Freddie Mercury gig.

00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:42.020
 It was an AIDS awareness gig, and it was at Wembley,

00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:43.940
 and he and his friends, they were stuck in queue for hours,

00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:46.460
 and his friends were all quite annoyed.

00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:48.300
 And he was quite mathematically minded

00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:50.620
 and thought, "Oh, God, this is really interesting, actually."

00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:53.260
 And so he got into queuing, and he then is--

00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:55.300
 - Interestingly, queuing for the Queen.

00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:56.140
 - Yeah!

00:48:56.140 --> 00:48:56.980
 (gasping)

00:48:56.980 --> 00:48:57.820
 - And queuing for Queen.

00:48:57.820 --> 00:48:59.180
 - Oh my God!

00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:01.180
 We've blown the shit wide open.

00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:04.660
 His next thing he did, he went to Wembley Stadium,

00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:07.220
 and he got special permission

00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:09.020
 from the whoever's running the grounds,

00:49:09.020 --> 00:49:11.700
 and he would spend his weekends, for ages,

00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:15.780
 sitting above the players' tunnel, watching the crowds.

00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:16.620
 - Oh!

00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:18.660
 The match was going on, but he's not watching it.

00:49:18.660 --> 00:49:20.020
 - I think he wouldn't have been paying any attention

00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:20.860
 to the match, yeah.

00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:22.940
 You just see this guy sitting above the, yeah.

00:49:22.940 --> 00:49:25.820
 - He can't, he said of the queue,

00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:27.260
 the one, the recent queue,

00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:29.300
 he would not have been able to withstand

00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:31.980
 the length of time it required to get to the front.

00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:34.300
 He himself can no longer queue within--

00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:35.140
 - Even queue.

00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:36.260
 - The queues he decides.

00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:37.100
 - Yeah.

00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:37.940
 - Because he's old.

00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:39.180
 - He's got an arthritic hip.

00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:40.020
 - Yeah.

00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:44.020
 - That must require him to keep still

00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:45.220
 more often than he'd like.

00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:46.740
 - Absolutely.

00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:49.980
 - It's funny 'cause he's got a lovely website,

00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:50.940
 and he lists his hobbies on it.

00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:51.780
 - Does he?

00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:52.620
 I didn't see his website.

00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:53.460
 - Oh, yeah, it's a great website.

00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:55.700
 Yeah, he owns multiple motorbikes,

00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:57.300
 and he plays bowls.

00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:58.140
 - Does he?

00:49:58.140 --> 00:49:59.220
 - That was quite a rare combo, I think,

00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:00.500
 like having a Harley-Davidson

00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:02.340
 and playing crown green bowls.

00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:03.980
 - Is it?

00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:04.820
 - Well, one seems quite hard to call.

00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:05.640
 - No, you're right.

00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:07.960
 In Hell's Angels, they were famous for their bowls, Matt.

00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:09.540
 - Sorry, they're the only people at motorbike.

00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:10.860
 I forgot that as well.

00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:11.900
 - He's got a big Harley-Davidson.

00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:12.740
 He's got a--

00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:15.940
 - I associate both with real ale pubs.

00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:17.680
 - I bet he loves a real ale.

00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:19.060
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:22.500
 Some other animals, queue, I didn't know this.

00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:23.340
 - Okay.

00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:24.180
 - Yeah, so--

00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:25.340
 - Hunts, probably, I reckon.

00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:26.180
 - Hunts.

00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:27.620
 - Yeah, must do, yeah.

00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:30.300
 Fish, queue, there are fish which queue.

00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:32.620
 Yeah, there's small goby fish, right?

00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:34.380
 They have this thing where they have a mating queue.

00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:36.140
 Okay, this is really, this is a bit sexy, actually.

00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:38.860
 So only the top male and female mate, right?

00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:40.740
 And all the other females have to wait in a queue

00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:42.020
 before they can have sex.

00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:44.340
 I think with the top male, but maybe it's actually,

00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:46.020
 there's a queue, there's a sort of queue of males,

00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:47.140
 I don't know.

00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:49.260
 But basically, to organize the queue,

00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:51.900
 they do it by a pecking order of sexiness.

00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:54.300
 And sexiness is body mass for them.

00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:56.940
 So the biggest female is the sexiest one

00:50:56.940 --> 00:50:58.380
 and gets to have sex first, right?

00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:00.060
 And then the next biggest and so on.

00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:02.140
 And they can measure, you know how in school

00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:04.580
 you had to line up for fire drills and things

00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:05.980
 with a height order.

00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:06.980
 - Did you, okay?

00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:07.820
 - Well, we did, yeah.

00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:09.820
 - Well, you're not too tall for that.

00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:12.040
 - I was always left to burn, wasn't it?

00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:14.860
 (laughing)

00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:16.660
 But the fish can tell their body mass, right?

00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:20.700
 So if the difference is more than 5% of their body mass,

00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:22.340
 like between one female and the next,

00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:23.940
 they will queue neatly, right?

00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:25.540
 And because they know who's bigger they can see.

00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:27.180
 - Well, 'cause they've all got scales, haven't they?

00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:29.440
 (laughing)

00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:32.660
 - But if the difference is smaller than 5%

00:51:32.660 --> 00:51:34.180
 between two females in the queue,

00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:36.260
 the smaller one will try and queue jump.

00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:37.780
 And we'll sort of say, this is, there's enough,

00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:40.260
 there's a small enough difference, I think I could do it.

00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:42.100
 And then the bigger one will drive it out of the group.

00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:43.660
 We'll sort of force it out of the queue.

00:51:43.660 --> 00:51:44.660
 They'll have a fight.

00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:47.100
 - Well, I think during that fight they both lose weight.

00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:47.940
 (laughing)

00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:49.380
 - This is what they, okay.

00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:50.700
 - Okay, it's similar to that.

00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:53.660
 Smaller fish will sometimes adjust their own size.

00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:56.240
 They will lose weight to avoid presenting a challenge

00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:57.460
 to the fish that's bigger than them.

00:51:57.460 --> 00:51:59.260
 So they don't get in a fight and they don't queue jump.

00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:01.340
 They say, right, I'll just shrink my own body.

00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:02.620
 - How do they do that?

00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:04.020
 - I guess they don't eat for a while.

00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:06.540
 - Oh, in the lead up to the queue, not as in, okay.

00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:07.720
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Not on the spot.

00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:11.260
 They can't do like a special, like shit everything else.

00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:14.900
 - Famous queue, when McDonald's opened in Moscow.

00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:15.740
 - Oh yeah.

00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:20.660
 - In 1990, people queued for six hours to get a McDonald's.

00:52:20.660 --> 00:52:25.100
 They served 30,000 people on the first day.

00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:29.620
 And one Big Mac cost 3.75 rubles.

00:52:29.620 --> 00:52:32.620
 And a monthly wage was 150 rubles.

00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:34.340
 So that is the equivalent today

00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:38.260
 of a Big Mac costing 52 pounds, 78 pence.

00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:39.260
 - Wow. - Wow.

00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:41.980
 - Yeah, and people queued for six hours to get that.

00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:42.820
 - Jesus.

00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:44.480
 - 'Cause if someone tells you it's that expensive,

00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:45.300
 you think it must be worth it.

00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:46.140
 - Exactly, yeah.

00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:51.140
 There was 700 seats inside and 200 outside of this,

00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:53.820
 this McDonald's in Pushkin Sky Square.

00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:57.860
 And so 900 people, that's about the same as a Globe Theater.

00:52:57.860 --> 00:52:59.940
 It was the largest McDonald's in the world

00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:01.900
 until McDonald's left Russia.

00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:02.980
 - Wow. - Wow.

00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:06.580
 - But in a sense, isn't McDonald's really the,

00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:10.460
 you know, the theater sort of space for,

00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:12.220
 - Keep going, you're getting there.

00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:13.220
 - You know, it's like.

00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:14.700
 - I've got no idea where you're going.

00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:16.380
 - I'm wondering where you're going to believe in him.

00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:17.460
 - Believe in him.

00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:18.300
 - He can do this.

00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:20.100
 - You know, what do you see at McDonald's late night?

00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:21.100
 You see drama.

00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:21.940
 - Yeah.

00:53:21.940 --> 00:53:23.420
 - You know, you go to a McDonald's,

00:53:23.420 --> 00:53:25.780
 and all human life is there, kind of like a theater.

00:53:25.780 --> 00:53:29.940
 - My Beth is a Macbeth, I love her Macbeth too.

00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:31.460
 - So much there for you, Andy.

00:53:31.460 --> 00:53:32.980
 - That was what you were going for.

00:53:32.980 --> 00:53:35.260
 - I feel like I did a lot of work in the midfield there,

00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:37.540
 and I just slaughtered at home.

00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:40.820
 I'm happy with that. - The shearer of your jokes.

00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:45.060
 We did on QI once that the way we load airplanes

00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:46.580
 is totally wrong.

00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:48.380
 So you know when you get, you're waiting for a plane

00:53:48.380 --> 00:53:51.460
 and they say, if you're in rows 50 to 70,

00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:53.260
 please come forward now.

00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:55.980
 And they load the back first, which seems to make sense.

00:53:55.980 --> 00:53:57.940
 Well, actually, that's the least efficient way to do it.

00:53:57.940 --> 00:53:59.260
 It's way more efficient just to say,

00:53:59.260 --> 00:54:01.020
 everyone randomly get on the plane.

00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:04.540
 - Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, close the door in four minutes.

00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:05.380
 Go.

00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:06.540
 - You mean the easy jet system.

00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:08.660
 (laughing)

00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:10.740
 - Leave the kids go.

00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:12.260
 - Well, the great thing is if you have kids,

00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:13.940
 you get to the front of the queue.

00:54:13.940 --> 00:54:15.900
 - Yeah, although that is one of the best ways to do it

00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:17.220
 is to make sure the slow loaders,

00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:20.100
 i.e. people with kids do get on first.

00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:21.180
 - That's why they do it, I guess.

00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:23.340
 - But yeah, someone studied it mathematically

00:54:23.340 --> 00:54:24.620
 and realized that loading from the back

00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:26.060
 is actually slower than doing it randomly

00:54:26.060 --> 00:54:28.100
 'cause people bunch up and they block each other,

00:54:28.100 --> 00:54:29.940
 but you're not loading the empty spaces.

00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:31.340
 And actually, one really good way to do it

00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:34.300
 is do window seats, then aisle seats, then middle seats.

00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:35.140
 - Oh, cool.

00:54:35.140 --> 00:54:35.980
 - Vice versa.

00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:36.820
 - Yeah, that's mad.

00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:38.460
 - I mean, it is an insane way of doing it.

00:54:38.460 --> 00:54:39.300
 - That's insane.

00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:40.820
 - 'Cause you're with, let's say you're three people

00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:42.180
 going on a plane, a family.

00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:43.020
 - Yeah.

00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:44.260
 - All right, just dad first.

00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:45.100
 (laughing)

00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:46.860
 - Now the four-year-old on their own.

00:54:46.860 --> 00:54:49.220
 (laughing)

00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:50.060
 Families are like,

00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:51.380
 "I do think that is a cool way of doing it."

00:54:51.380 --> 00:54:52.940
 Because then, everyone's slotted,

00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:55.180
 everyone goes to the end of their row where the windows are

00:54:55.180 --> 00:54:58.300
 and no one's faffing about in the corridor bit of the plane.

00:54:58.300 --> 00:54:59.420
 - They're not doing it on purpose, Andy.

00:54:59.420 --> 00:55:01.340
 They just need to get their bags into the--

00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:02.980
 - I'm not sure the window seat knocks that out

00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:05.020
 because you still need to get your bag into the top bit.

00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:06.020
 - Well, I think the key thing to do

00:55:06.020 --> 00:55:07.660
 is everyone just carries the bag with them

00:55:07.660 --> 00:55:09.860
 and just holds it in their arms until the plane's taken off.

00:55:09.860 --> 00:55:11.660
 Then you can put it up in the racks, Vove.

00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:13.420
 - I don't think you're allowed to hold the bags

00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:16.660
 in your arms, especially if you're on an emergency exit seat.

00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:17.500
 - Yeah, that's true, yeah.

00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:20.460
 - Andy, I'm afraid, I'm afraid to sit in front of you.

00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:21.500
 Anyway.

00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:22.820
 - Oh, well, don't fly.

00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:24.740
 (laughing)

00:55:24.740 --> 00:55:26.980
 - I was reading a website called LineLogic

00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:30.060
 and they specialize in looking at public guidances

00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:31.660
 and line management solutions.

00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:34.300
 And so they go into businesses and try and sort out

00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:36.060
 how they can best manage their crowds and stuff.

00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:40.300
 And they say that the word faffing directly relates

00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:43.340
 to the idea of getting to the front of a queue

00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:45.180
 and then waiting for that person

00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:46.980
 who's just in front of you, who's paid

00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:49.100
 to sort of gather their things together.

00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:51.260
 The faffing that they do of sort of like

00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:53.100
 putting their wallet back and stuff.

00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:54.420
 - Well, like that's the first instance

00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:55.260
 of the word faffing.

00:55:55.260 --> 00:55:56.620
 - It's what this website is.

00:55:56.620 --> 00:55:57.460
 - What is this website?

00:55:57.460 --> 00:55:58.300
 Who are these people?

00:55:58.300 --> 00:55:59.120
 - It's LineLogic.

00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:00.460
 - What are their credentials?

00:56:00.460 --> 00:56:01.620
 - I'm back 'em, that's great.

00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:02.660
 - But they say that faffing time

00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:05.100
 takes roughly 3.17 seconds.

00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:07.900
 That's the average faff that you'll have, yeah.

00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:09.340
 - That's plausible.

00:56:09.340 --> 00:56:11.660
 'Cause you can pride yourself on being a non-faffer

00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:13.700
 once you're at the front of a queue.

00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:15.100
 Right now I've got my wallet, I'm ready,

00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:16.180
 I'm ready to put the card away,

00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:17.940
 I'm ready to grab the thing, go, you know.

00:56:17.940 --> 00:56:19.020
 Or you can faff.

00:56:19.020 --> 00:56:19.860
 - Yeah.

00:56:19.860 --> 00:56:20.700
 - I wonder which you are, Andy.

00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:21.540
 - Yeah.

00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:22.380
 (laughing)

00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:24.260
 - I pride myself on my non-faffing.

00:56:24.260 --> 00:56:26.860
 - You really amazed us, really.

00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:29.740
 - Oh, you guys were expecting that, I see, yeah.

00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:31.220
 - It felt like a weighted survey

00:56:31.220 --> 00:56:33.620
 when you explained the difference between the two.

00:56:33.620 --> 00:56:36.140
 - Because they do say some people are absolutely awesome

00:56:36.140 --> 00:56:39.340
 and they always know exactly how to leave a check out.

00:56:39.340 --> 00:56:41.180
 - And you get these complete arseholes.

00:56:41.180 --> 00:56:44.060
 - Well, I panic am annoying the people behind me, basically.

00:56:44.060 --> 00:56:44.900
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:56:44.900 --> 00:56:46.540
 - The time when you finished your transaction

00:56:46.540 --> 00:56:49.340
 feels, you know, longer to you.

00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:51.300
 - I agree, I often rush off without my shopping.

00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:53.140
 (laughing)

00:56:53.140 --> 00:56:54.900
 - But I feel you're the type of personality

00:56:54.900 --> 00:56:56.860
 that would wanna make sure that was acknowledged.

00:56:56.860 --> 00:56:58.700
 And then so you would somehow waste the person

00:56:58.700 --> 00:56:59.980
 behind you's time going.

00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:00.820
 - Wait, why am I--

00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:03.740
 - No worries, get in out of your way there so quickly.

00:57:03.740 --> 00:57:07.580
 - Oh, just don't worry, just another day being a hero, yeah.

00:57:07.580 --> 00:57:09.420
 - I reckon you just go, "Beep!"

00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:10.260
 - Yeah.

00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:12.540
 - Three seconds, 24, very good.

00:57:12.540 --> 00:57:14.380
 - Enjoy that extra second I'll say you do.

00:57:14.380 --> 00:57:16.180
 (laughing)

00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:18.760
 (upbeat music)

00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:22.780
 - Okay, that's it, that's all of our facts.

00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:24.100
