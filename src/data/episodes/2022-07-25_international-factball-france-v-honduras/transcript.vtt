00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
 Hello and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing" as a fish presents the World Cup of Facts.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.840
 This is the only World Cup podcast out there that makes absolutely no mention of football whatsoever.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.520
 Brought to you by the QI Elves in association with Visitingland.com.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.000
 My name is Dan Scheriber. I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Anarchizanski, and Andy Murray.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.800
 And today's match is France vs Honduras.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.560
 France.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.960
 Okay, I've found a nice number of silly-named places.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:27.760
 Oh, France.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.320
 I always love a silly-named place, so there are six places in France called Silly,

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.120
 13 called Billy, and a place called Pratt, which is great.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.160
 There's also pissy, corny, punchy, misery, messy, and pussy.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.880
 French seven dwarfs.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:49.200
 Potatoes were illegal in France between 1748 and 1772.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.000
 What happened?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.120
 You weren't allowed to grow them.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.800
 People thought that they were very bad for your health.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:00.000
 And then a great hero chemist called Antoine Augustin Palmentier is the man who rehabilitated them

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.160
 and said, "Actually, they are okay."

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.000
 He said, "This is nonsense. This is fine. I think bits of them can be harmful,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.560
 but if you eat the actual potato bit, you're generally all right."

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.240
 Oh, so they thought they were actually harmful.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.080
 It wasn't just yet atkins of the early 18th century, you were saying.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.880
 Oh, they thought they made you very ill.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.360
 And in the 16th century, France, women were forbidden for eating artichokes

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.440
 because they were thought to be aphrodisiacs.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.000
 Wow, wow. A lot of food banning going on here.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.480
 Yeah.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.760
 It has a lot of good kings, France, Charles the mad.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.360
 He was one of the best, wasn't he?

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.120
 Charles the sixth who ruled in the 15th century.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.240
 He thought he was made of glass and was terrified he was going to shatter.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.280
 I think he had iron rods installed in all of his clothes

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.120
 to make sure that he didn't shatter.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.880
 And people weren't allowed to touch him.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.720
 Louis the 10th of France is the first tennis player whose name is known from history.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:50.800
 That's good, yeah.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.800
 Was he any good? What was his forte, topspin?

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.160
 I have no idea.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:00.160
 Louis the 15th installed, some people would say, the first example of a lift

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.560
 as in a lift that carries humans.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.920
 He installed a lift as flying chair.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.760
 Is that what he called it? The flying chair.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.240
 Why did we stop calling lift flying chairs?

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.600
 We've stalled down the language that way.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.960
 Because we stopped sitting in them.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.960
 He installed his flying chair so that he could transport his mistress

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.360
 who was two floors above him in the palace at Versailles,

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.680
 up and down to visit him whenever she wanted to.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.920
 Surely it's much more obvious to install a massive lift than it's now and now.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.880
 You're so subtle.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.440
 And God you came this way, the servants will never know.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.560
 Above the servant who's doing the door in the lift.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.160
 And the bunch of people watching are going, what is this machine?

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.360
 This is amazing.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.920
 He was great though. He also installed a flying table,

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.960
 his tubla volant, which descended from the so he'd be having a big dinner in his dining room.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.520
 And then after one course, a hole would appear in the floor and the table would sink down into

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.200
 the kitchen's below and the servants would load it up with all the food for their next course,

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.240
 and then it would rise up again into his dining room.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.680
 That's proper showmanship.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.320
 You can see why you had a mistress now because that's a pretty impressive move.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.480
 It is. It was to stop the invasive filthy servants being seen at the dinner table.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.400
 Another Louis, Louis the 18th of France, supposedly could tell from smelling a rabbit stew,

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.400
 which part of France the rabbit had been killed in.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.760
 Wow, but I think that might be hype because I just don't believe it.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:30.720
 In 1948, the French Olympic team sent their wine ahead a month in advance so that it had time to settle.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:40.000
 Very cool. Do you know where 85% of French people like to go on holiday?

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.760
 Oh, wait. Is it nowhere?

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.560
 They don't go anywhere.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.600
 Well, they go to France.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.320
 Yeah, yeah.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.360
 85% of French people go to France for their holidays.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.720
 They could come to England, which invented champagne.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.760
 Just thought I'd mention that.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.400
 Oh, yeah.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.600
 Yeah, it's an English invention.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.840
 The 15th century France, one in every four days, was an official holiday of some sort.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.400
 And that still is the case today.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:06.240
 Yeah, and they would, they created their own saints, such as Saint Cockette,

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.360
 the patron saint of talkative women, and Saint Jean-Bon, patron saint of ham.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.440
 Cool. That's amazing.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.880
 Everyone needs a patron saint of ham.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.680
 The guillotine was only outlawed in France in 1981, wasn't it?

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.880
 So it was, and the last person to be guillotine in France was in 1977.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:23.440
 Wow.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.200
 And the last public one was in 1939, and Christopher Lee went.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.120
 The actor Christopher Lee from all the hammer horror films,

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.320
 and he was there, he was 17 years old at the time,

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.800
 and he saw France's last public guillotine.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.280
 Wow.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.240
 Pretty crazy.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.720
 We have the French Revolution to thank for public zoos.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.840
 I think it was the French Revolution that caused the creation of the first public zoo,

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.240
 because the National Assembly ruled that all privately owned exotic animals had to be donated to

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.200
 the Versailles estate, and so they set up a zoo.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.360
 But I also really love the giraffe called Zeraffa,

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.560
 which was a gift to the French King Charles X from the Ottoman Viceroy,

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.080
 and she became so popular this giraffe, and so famous that people in Paris started

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.640
 dressing like giraffes, and having these giraffe hairstyles, and like giraffe skin,

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.960
 imitation coats who are really fashionable, but yeah, giraffe hairstyles, they were in 19th century.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.800
 What, they also ate all the animals in the Paris Zoo in 1870, when there was a siege.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.560
 Yeah, someone else went Manet's cat.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.440
 Really during that siege, I think.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.080
 Wow.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.640
 Well, they had, they had the great cat massacre, didn't they?

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.840
 Is it that in France?

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.240
 That was in France in, oh, I don't know, do I remember?

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.480
 In 1730s, France, it was a form of workers revolt, and basically a printer's apprentices

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.400
 were annoyed that they were being treated worse off than their bosses' cats.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.360
 And so, and then being fed rubbish cat food and everything.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.560
 So at night, they imitated these howling cats that their bosses loved so much,

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.200
 night after night, until the printer's bosses thought that the cats were like,

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.240
 were satanic and evil, and all of that they all be killed.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.280
 And then they made the apprentices go out and massacre them all, and then they got hanged.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.600
 How do you, the hanged of the cats?

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.800
 They put them on, so they killed them all, they then put them on trial, post mortem,

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.040
 and then they hanged them, so they found guilty witchcraft.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.880
 They have to do it nine times for each cat.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:12.160
 Okay, that's the halftime whistle there, which means it's time for our halftime show.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:17.120
 And that is brought to you by visitinglin.com and comes in the form of a QI quiz.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.080
 And there are three questions today, James, the first question.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.880
 Simply, how many oaks are there in seven oaks?

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.040
 Is there a clue in the question?

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.760
 Is it a trick?

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:26.960
 Who knows?

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:27.920
 Could it be a trick?

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.440
 That would be so unlike you.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.240
 Yes, a QI Elf with a trick question that you have thought it's, or maybe it's a double bluff?

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.520
 Andy, your question.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:40.240
 What classic dad pastime has an entire museum in Merseyside devoted to it?

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.240
 Solling asleep with a newspaper on your face?

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.040
 Maybe, you'll have to wait and find out.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.280
 And Anna, what's yours?

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:52.960
 My question is, which road in England has been used as a road since before Britain was an island?

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.360
 Okay, so those are the three questions for today's quiz.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.800
 If you want to find out the answers to them,

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.840
 we're going to be revealing them at the end of this episode.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:03.520
 But now it's time for the second half of the match, and it's Honduras.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:07.840
 Is the original banana republic,

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.800
 as in the first ever phrase, banana republic, was used to describe Honduras,

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.480
 because the US banana companies had so much influence there,

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:21.360
 and 66% of the whole country's imports were bananas in 1913.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.400
 Speaking of fruit companies, you know, next and after the moon landings,

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.720
 gave a moon bit of moonrock to every country in the world.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.080
 Honduras is one of those countries.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:32.880
 And the bit of moonrock mysteriously disappeared very soon after it had been given to the country.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:38.960
 And it was found in possession of, it was bought by a fruit seller in 1993.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.120
 Oh, I think, for quite a lot of money.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.880
 Wow. Wow, a fruit seller.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:43.920
 Fruit selling, yeah.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.880
 Presumably a rich, big business fruit seller, not a guy with a stall.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:50.080
 Yeah, not a guy who's just selling apples for ten cents a dollar.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:54.640
 Like, apple ten cents, banana fifteen cents, moonrock, two hundred thousand dollars.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:58.880
 I wasn't, I just came out for an apple, but actually.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:03.280
 I like this. This is something I read about these guys.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:07.120
 Is that they have a lot of fish falling out of the sky in Honduras.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:11.280
 A lot of fish falling out of the sky.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:16.000
 So much so that they have an annual festival now called the Honduran festival

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.640
 of the rain of the fishes, where they celebrate the kind of anticipation

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.040
 that is going to happen again, it happens so regularly now.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.040
 What, what, what, what, they don't know.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:29.520
 They don't know where the fish come from, but thousands of fish just fall out of the sky.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.480
 At the same time, at the same time, not at the same time every year,

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:35.840
 but it's happened enough times such a common occurrence that.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.280
 And it's a thing that happens worldwide, where you know, things fall out of the sky.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.360
 I think it is, I think it is every year in Honduras, isn't it?

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:45.440
 I think it's, it is the claim, although it was gone to be here,

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.080
 went to be verified by National Geographic in the 70s.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.400
 And they said there were fish all over the streets,

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.840
 but they still couldn't get any evidence of it falling from them, falling from the sky.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.680
 One of the most famous things about Honduras,

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.320
 I know we're not supposed to mention football, was the football war.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:58.960
 Oh, okay.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:04.560
 Of course, Honduras versus El Salvador, they met in a soccer match in 1970,

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.560
 a very tense match, and then some fighting broke out on their stands,

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.560
 and eventually it turned into a war.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:15.520
 Lasted six days, and as usual, there was no side that could declare themselves the winner.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.760
 We were talking about bananas before and fruit.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.880
 There was, there's still a lot of bananas grown in Honduras,

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:26.720
 but obviously, as we all know, bananas are in a bit of trouble with viruses and stuff,

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.400
 and they might be dying out.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.840
 But there's some Honduran scientists who are trying to help with that,

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:38.720
 and they sived 400 tons of bananas to find just 15 seeds for breeding a new type of...

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.000
 Wow!

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.440
 That is pretty good work as well.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.960
 Yeah, that's very exciting.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.480
 I've never sived bananas.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:45.440
 You need a big siv.

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.040
 Yeah, imagine.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.440
 Well, I think that was just a metaphor.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.480
 I see.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.880
 Sorry, I was thinking a colander at least.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:56.080
 Like the idea of new bananas.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:56.560
 Yeah.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:57.840
 A new species of bananas, big names.

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.600
 I should say there are loads of species of bananas,

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.520
 but it's just that we only eat one of them.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.240
 Uh.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.280
 Why, why are there so many?

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.640
 Then the others are unedible.

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:05.920
 Plantains are a type of banana,

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:08.240
 but there are other kinds of plantains that are more woody

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.800
 and with lots of seeds, which are pretty unedible.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:11.600
 Oh, okay.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.160
 Okay.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:16.560
 Honduras was also the first spot of land where Columbus landed.

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:19.200
 Columbus comes up in almost every one of these podcasts.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.400
 It was a busy boy.

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:21.440
 He did a lot of trouble.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.360
 Yeah, it was Trujillo in Honduras.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.240
 That was the first bit of mainland America he landed on.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:26.880
 Oh, wow.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:27.600
 Yeah.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.720
 They should be called Colombia.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:29.920
 Yeah.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.440
 I think that would be quite confusing, though,

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.120
 because there already is a Colombia.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.960
 I think I would have heard of a place called Colombia.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.120
 Oh, good point.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.480
 The Honduran flag.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.560
 This is just a tiny little nugget,

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:41.760
 but the Honduran flag, you know,

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.400
 has its three stripes and the two outer stripes of blue.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.400
 And that's to represent the ocean on either side of it.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.080
 So it's the Caribbean sea on one side

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.360
 and the Pacific Ocean on the other.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.240
 It's nice.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:50.960
 That's cool.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:54.480
 Okay, there it is as the final whistle.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.640
 But before we find out who's one today's match,

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.320
 we are going to quickly reveal the answers

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.360
 to that visiting Linquiz that we did as our halftime show

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.760
 and the answer to the first question, James.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.120
 How many oaks in seven oaks?

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:05.520
 Yep.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:06.080
 Is it seven?

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:06.880
 It's six.

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:07.680
 It's eight.

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:08.800
 Oh, we should have known.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.360
 They had seven, six of them blew down,

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:12.960
 and then they planted another seven.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.120
 Okay, Andy, what you're a question?

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.800
 Mine was about the classic dad pastime,

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.640
 which has an entire Moesyside Museum,

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.240
 and that is mowing the lawn.

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.080
 There is a lawnmower museum there.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.320
 Okay, any question number three was yours, Anna?

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.840
 Yeah, so I asked which road in England

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.400
 has been used as a road since before Britain was an island,

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.680
 and it is the rich way,

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:30.880
 which I'm sure many of you know,

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:33.520
 runs through a lot of these southern counties.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:34.720
 Okay, fantastic.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.000
 All right, well, those are the answers.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.840
 If you would like to win a prize, though,

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.840
 you can actually head over to visitinglin.com

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.720
 where there's going to be all sorts of QI goodies waiting there,

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.840
 possibly a signed QI book from Anna Chazinsky,

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.680
 which would be very exciting.

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.240
 Now it's time to decide who has won today's match,

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.960
 and we are going to go to Anna

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.200
 to make that decision, France or Honduras.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.400
 Well, I always like to send wine ahead of me wherever I go

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.800
 to make sure it arrives on time and it is sufficiently cool,

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.200
 and so I'm going to go with France because they do it too.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.120
 Okay, so that's it from us.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.600
 We're going to be back again tomorrow with another match,

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:08.880
 and that will be James.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.280
 That is Germany against Portugal.

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:12.960
 Germany versus Portugal. Great.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.280
 If you want to ask us questions about this match,

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.040
 though, you can get us on our Twitter handles.

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.480
 I'm on @Sriberland, James.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.840
 @AgeShakesAndy.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:20.880
 @AndruHondaM.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.640
 @Quikipedia.

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:26.640
 We're just the QI to defeat not mine, but I'll reply.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:28.480
 Okay, we'll see you guys again tomorrow.
