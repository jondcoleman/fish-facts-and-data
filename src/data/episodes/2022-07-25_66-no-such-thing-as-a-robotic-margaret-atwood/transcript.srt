00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:19,000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,160
 to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden. My name is Dad Shriver. I'm sitting here

4
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,220
 with Andy Murray, James Harkin, and Ann Miller. And once again, we have gathered around

5
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,400
 the microphone with our four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular

6
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:39,300
 order, here we go. Starting with you, Harkin. My fact this week is that in the 1840s, London

7
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,800
 buses had straps attached to the driver's arms that you would yank if you wanted to stop.

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:52,140
 It just seems like the worst idea in the world. In 1839, they invented the bell on buses,

9
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,880
 and then they decided to go to the strap version afterwards. So these are horse buses,

10
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:02,200
 of course. And in those days, you didn't have to go on the left-hand side of the right-hand

11
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,440
 side of the road, and there were no bus stops or anything like that. So when you wanted

12
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,440
 to stop, you needed to tell the driver which direction you wanted to go to the right-hand

13
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,960
 side of the road or the left-hand side. So if you wanted to stop on the right-hand side,

14
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,640
 you would yank his right strap, and that would move his right arm, which would move the

15
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,920
 horse to the side of the road, and then he would stop. I read that they didn't have to even

16
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,120
 pull over to stop for 40 years after the horse drawn bus was invented. So 1829, I think, was

17
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:33,360
 the first one. And there was a new law passed in 1867, which said, "Really, you should probably

18
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,200
 pull over to the side of the street before you just stop the bus." Yeah, until then they

19
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,740
 would just stop dead. I think the first buses in London, they just did the route, and

20
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,660
 they would let you on wherever the 70 people could get on, and you just would hail it.

21
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:47,100
 You weren't stops and things, so I guess they just thought, "Well, if you let you on anywhere,

22
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,820
 you can get off." Yeah, that sounds really good, actually.

23
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:53,620
 How did you used to park when you had a horse attached to your car?

24
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:57,620
 With parallel parking? Yeah, parallel parking, three-point turns. How's the deal work?

25
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,580
 You would pull your horses off and they would feed or drink what?

26
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,100
 Big your butt.

27
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,740
 If you were a caring horse owner. You would pull him off to the right if you wanted to.

28
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,700
 The horse had two straps attached to it, actually.

29
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:14,560
 Okay, that reminds me of another thing about people with straps attached to them, the

30
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:21,260
 Huichal Indians of central Mexico. During childbirth, the father would sit above his wife who's

31
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:26,900
 giving birth and have a strap attached to his testicles. Whenever she had labor pains,

32
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:31,940
 she would yank on the strap and yank his testicles so that he would have the same pain as her.

33
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,860
 Good child. It hasn't been a great idea.

34
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,260
 Oh my god. When did that stop?

35
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,260
 It's a traditional thing. I don't think it's happened for hundreds of years.

36
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,740
 I don't know why that died out.

37
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:47,300
 Another thing about buses is that driving buses wasn't actually legal until 1832. For the first

38
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,300
 three years, it hadn't been properly regulated or anything. Drivers would chain themselves

39
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,980
 to their seats, but they were still arrested anyway. They were training themselves to stop

40
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,940
 being, you know, stopped from driving by the authorities. Yeah.

41
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,300
 That's awesome. Isn't that insane?

42
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,580
 After World War I, there weren't that many buses in London, including repurposed during

43
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:09,060
 World War. So Mr A. Partridge realised that he could make some money by running his own

44
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,060
 buses on the same route so he'd go alongside the official buses, but he would sort of take

45
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,060
 short cuts to avoid traffic and make his buses better.

46
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,060
 Oh wow.

47
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,220
 And if you often see races between the official bus and then the Pirate bus.

48
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:23,220
 That's great. When he thought of that idea, he must have gone, ah-ha!

49
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,260
 Back on the net.

50
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:28,300
 They do that in some other countries. I think in Moscow, they have like unofficial buses

51
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,220
 that you can kind of get on them. They're a little bit cheaper than the official

52
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:34,180
 buses. It's like hustling for mini-cups. It's when it's driving fast.

53
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:38,140
 St Lucia has those as well, I think. They have sort of, well, they have a range of buses

54
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,660
 of different levels of officialness, essentially.

55
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,140
 Do you guys remember the bendy buses?

56
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,140
 Yeah.

57
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,140
 Do you know where they are now?

58
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,140
 Australia.

59
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,140
 I mean, we have a lot of them in Australia.

60
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,140
 I hadn't noticed that they weren't there anymore.

61
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,140
 They've got them. Yeah.

62
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,220
 So they can't live in some brought them in. Then Boris got rid of them saying they were

63
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:57,020
 a monstrosity and we didn't want them. So they went to Malta. Malta has very narrow,

64
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:00,700
 tight roads and they are very difficult to maneuver through traffic. So they were a complete

65
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:04,580
 disaster, not least because on the day all the drivers went on strike. So they shipped and

66
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:09,180
 drove us from the UK who didn't know the route or the language. They called us complete chaos.

67
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:14,420
 And they're called Areva, which is arriving in Italian and they got nicknamed "Bespetta",

68
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:18,220
 which means waiting because they were just rubbish. So Malta have now passed them on and

69
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,220
 they're now in Sudan.

70
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:25,740
 It's really windy buses. That's unbelievable. That is really interesting.

71
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,860
 Do they drive the buses to these places or do they fly them?

72
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,780
 I think it's a plane with two straps on and then they start from the ground.

73
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:37,380
 So there's one person who was in Malta who wants to go to Sudan and you're finally the buses

74
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:43,540
 turned up. We wait ages for a bus to Sudan and then all of London's bendy buses come at

75
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:47,940
 once. Just back in the day where everything was horse-drawn, something that hadn't occurred

76
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,420
 to me and I read in a book the other day is that if you had an emergency and you needed

77
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:57,420
 a doctor, doctors just used to leap on a horse and ride to the scene. I don't know why that's

78
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:02,620
 such an amazing image of a doctor speeding down the road on a horse. He had to shout the

79
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:07,220
 word ambulance backwards as he rode.

80
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:11,380
 I really like this. The double-decker bus was introduced, maybe I think about 20 years

81
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:15,460
 after the original horse-drawn bus and supposedly it was introduced for the Great Exhibition.

82
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:19,540
 Before they had a proper staircase, they just had kind of an iron ladder, which was three

83
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:23,980
 or four quite high iron steps, but there were also seats available on either side of

84
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:29,220
 the driver. There's one book, it's called Transport in Britain from Canal Lock to Gridlock. It

85
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,380
 says that the seats were hard to get, but they were highly prized by younger passengers

86
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:38,540
 because of the driver's great reputation for jokes and witty repartee. So nothing changes,

87
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:43,780
 does it? It was the original banter bus.

88
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:49,540
 Here's the thing, here's the best thing I found this week. Who invented the bus? Jack Bus.

89
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:55,100
 The earliest known public bus line, it was called The Carriage, was launched by Blaise Pascal.

90
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,100
 The mathematician, the mathematician and philosopher, the guy.

91
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,700
 He was a bus company in his first time. I don't know, it's unbelievable, isn't it?

92
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:05,580
 How can that even be true? It was unwiccapedia and they checked it out and there's some books,

93
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,300
 some philosophy books about him and apparently it's true.

94
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:13,660
 That is incredible. I wish I knew more about Blaise Pascal, so I could put that in context.

95
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:20,660
 Okay, so in mathematics, he did Pascal's Triangle, which is a famous load of numbers in a triangle

96
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:27,380
 where the two above add to the one below. He has the SI unit of a pressure named after him.

97
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:34,340
 He wrote a famous book called The Ponce, which was a philosophy book and he was a great French

98
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:37,580
 kind of... Transport in 2C. Yeah, but yeah, I mean, he was one of the

99
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:42,020
 great 17th century French thinkers and he also invented the bus.

100
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:46,380
 That is incredible. How did the bus fall off from his list of achievements?

101
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,620
 Well, it's the one that no one ever talks about these days, really?

102
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,860
 Yeah, I read a theory and I'm still trying to get to the bottom of this because it sounds

103
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:58,100
 like there is some truth to it, but not as much as most articles would suggest.

104
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:03,100
 Do you know why the railroads in this country are the width that they are?

105
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:07,980
 Yes, it's a stride of a yeti, isn't it?

106
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:14,700
 Though it's the idea that obviously when trains were horse-drawn, you had two horses pulling

107
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:20,540
 the train and the width of the railroads now are the widths of what two horses standing next

108
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:25,540
 to each other would be. Now that's a theory that apparently in America as well, that with

109
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,460
 all the railroads, that's how it became. But then different countries have different

110
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,460
 gauges. Exactly. Yeah, and in fact Britain had two different gauges.

111
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:34,780
 Yeah. And America had 20. This is where the theory falls down slightly.

112
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:38,860
 Maybe the horses got like fatter in certain states. Yeah, that's true, that's possible.

113
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:43,100
 Did you put diets? There was a way it could have gone. Oh God, there was an amazing programme

114
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,860
 about this ages and ages ago on the beach. And it was basically saying that there were

115
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:51,180
 two gauges, a narrow gauge and a broad gauge for trains. And the whole of the country eventually

116
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,500
 went with the narrow gauge simply because it had spread further and faster, like basically

117
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:01,860
 VHS over beatermax, if you'd like. And so now these days we could have these incredible

118
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:08,020
 lavish, huge trains, but we don't have to kind of squeeze through the aisle to our coffees

119
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:12,500
 and stuff. Exactly. I have a thing about, there was a guide to bus etiquette printed in the

120
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:18,060
 times in 1834. I just love this so much. So they're quite similar, like number one, keep

121
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:22,180
 your feet off the seats, to do not get into a snug corner yourself and then open the

122
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:27,900
 windows to admit a north-western upon the neck of your neighbour. A window. Is it weird

123
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,740
 when you get on a tube and someone just immediately gets on a tube and opens a window

124
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,420
 without checking the temperature, just goes on, opens a window and says, "Yes, that is true,

125
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:41,500
 that is weird." Sometimes you get on and it's like walking into an oven. If it's summer,

126
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,340
 it's winter. I get really pissed off by people who open windows. You know how you keep learning

127
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:48,740
 a few things about yourself as the years go on? It's a new thing I've learned very recently.

128
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:53,860
 If people are opening windows whenever you walk into a room and you bite into the problem,

129
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:57,060
 someone else is saying, "You know what, I've recently found out I hate people who smell bad."

130
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:04,260
 What can you do? This bus that I get guides then starts to go slightly off the rails of

131
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:08,900
 where we know. So number six is, "Do not spit upon the straw. You are not in a hog-stay."

132
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:13,940
 Number seven, "Behave respect for leaf to females and put not on an unprotected last

133
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:18,860
 the blush because she cannot escape from your brutality." Which is very good advice.

134
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:23,260
 Number eight, "If you bring a dog, let him be small and confined by a string." That's

135
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:29,060
 like, "Oh, big dogs are going, please let me be small." That's like on the underline, isn't

136
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:39,700
 there's like a rule that you can have a dog on the escrow if you can hold it? So there is

137
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:47,900
 a bus that goes from Bristol to Bath, which is powered by poo. The biobus and it's powered

138
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:55,060
 by bio-mefengast, actually, which comes from from excrement. And it can travel up to 186 miles

139
00:09:55,060 --> 00:10:02,060
 on one tank of gas. So you're going to say on one poo? Just to try and get out, we're going

140
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:10,500
 to get six miles. I've got to top it up. It opens up the cap. I've read your eyes.

141
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:16,460
 No, it can go 186 miles on one tank of gas, which takes the annual waste of around five

142
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:21,820
 people to produce. So five people have to poo for one year to get one tank of gas.

143
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:27,540
 Yeah, that's not so bad. Yeah, because I do that every day, not a year's worth, but

144
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:31,900
 it's not like I'd have to be like, "Oh, better poo." All you'd have to do is just bag what

145
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:36,300
 you're doing, right? I see what you mean. I don't know. I'm just saying it's not, it's

146
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,540
 bag what you're doing and posted off to Bristol. They'll be thrilled. The council buildings

147
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:52,180
 will be fine. Okay, time for fact number two. And that is Miller. My fact is that standing

148
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:56,980
 like Superman can make you more successful. I love that. Which is why I'm doing it right

149
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,380
 now. So explain how can that work? Do we know?

150
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:03,580
 Okay, so it's a thing called power opposing, which is basically about body language and

151
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:07,980
 giving off the right impression. And it's the work of Amy Cuddy, who's a social psychologist

152
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,260
 at Harvard, who records we should all spend two minutes a day power opposing. So there's

153
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:15,020
 lots of various posters you can do, but the best one is superheroes. So hands on hips,

154
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:19,860
 chest out, head up, in sort of classic superhero. And people who do this will have increased levels

155
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,580
 of testosterone, a decrease in cortisol, which is the stress hormone, and feel both more

156
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:28,020
 powerful and more open to risk. People who take low post reposes have the opposite.

157
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,500
 What are low post reposes? Things like slumping in on yourself. It's basically making yourself

158
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,700
 small. So it's thinking if you go to a meeting and you sort of bend your knees, you tuck

159
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:41,500
 your arms in your head style. Being naked and crying in the corner is a lot of bad impressions

160
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,980
 in job interview. People, they found that people with someone who's doing a powerful pose

161
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,940
 in a powerful position, rather than copying them, you're more likely, even if you are relatively

162
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,660
 powerful, to then adopt a weaker stance. By presenting is more confidence, you become

163
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:56,380
 more confident. So by being superman, you will become not quite superman, but with superman

164
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:00,820
 like power. Well, here's the thing. It also works if you wear superman outfits, partly.

165
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:05,780
 Yeah, the less effort. So they put students in various different

166
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:10,060
 items of clothing and got them to do mental ability tests, and they found that generally people

167
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:16,900
 are getting about 64%. But people in superman t-shirts were getting 72%. And also people wearing

168
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:21,380
 white coats did better as well. Oh, this one's interesting, because wearing a love coat makes

169
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:25,780
 you better, but they're taking love coats away for doctors. So they have to done doing superman

170
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:29,180
 poses of counterbalances. Otherwise, it's going to be because the doctors will perform

171
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:34,220
 really because they're wearing the wrong outfit. The costume thing also actually works for Christopher

172
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:40,540
 Reeve. There's a story in Roger Moore's autobiography where while they were filming the movie, Christopher

173
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:44,300
 Reeve during breaks where he couldn't get out of his clothes, if it was lunchtime, would go to the Pinewood

174
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:49,900
 Studios canteen, which is where they were filming. And if he went out in his superman costume, he was just

175
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:54,460
 swarmed, girls coming around, swarming around him, just totally in love with him. If he came out during

176
00:12:54,460 --> 00:13:02,540
 the Clark Kent scenes, just no one came near him, he was just left alone. I think this is really good.

177
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:06,380
 I really like this. I'm going to start doing this power-posing. We still all the time. You don't have

178
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:09,260
 to do it front of people. You can do it for two minutes when you got up in the morning. Yeah,

179
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:14,220
 I want to do that. I want to do those benefits with you. There is one bad thing about wearing superman

180
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:19,980
 costumes, and that is if you're a child, because apparently superhero costumes cause children to hurt

181
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:26,460
 themselves, because they start doing playing, which is a bit like they try and fly stuff like that. Do

182
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:32,220
 you guys know that Superman was originally evil? No, he wasn't. No, I don't know. Well, you could take

183
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:37,500
 out with Jerry Siegel and Joe Strister, who came up with Superman. In 1932, they did a story called

184
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:42,060
 "The Rain of the Superman" about a homeless man called Bill Dunn, who was transformed by a mad

185
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:46,700
 scientist who used a secret chemical to help him be able to read and control minds. The Superman,

186
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:51,020
 with these new powers, kills his creator and starts playing the stock market and winning races to get

187
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:55,020
 rich enough to take over the world and then loses it all. Is that because he likes risk because he's

188
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:59,340
 been doing these power-poses that he's playing the stock market? Yeah, I think that's what happens.

189
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:06,220
 And then obviously they rewrote him and he was nicer. Different. And an alien and not an insane

190
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:11,580
 word to regard him the way. Wow. I was thought by the way that anytime I saw a portrait of Henry VIII,

191
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:15,980
 that he was adopting a Superman pose. Yeah. Yeah, he does make himself look nice. That's true. I wonder

192
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,980
 how many people from history is that where that pose was inspired by. Please don't make that a tumbler.

193
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:24,060
 A superhero history. Yes, Superman poses in history. Oh, that's a really good idea.

194
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:30,140
 Okay, there's a guy. There was a newspaper article I read about Superman and it said something like

195
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:34,700
 this. When Clark Kent wanted to transform into Superman, it was a fairly simple task. He would

196
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:41,180
 step into a phone box, spin around and the switch would be complete. For Herbert Chavez, his change

197
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:48,140
 into the comic book was taken a bit longer through 16 years of plastic surgery. Oh, my God.

198
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:54,700
 And yeah, he's had plastic surgery to make him look like Superman. Oh, but you're beautiful as you are.

199
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:59,820
 Just do the posture, that's enough. He doesn't really look that much like Superman, to be honest.

200
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:04,140
 Yeah. Do you mean before or after he doesn't look like? In neither case, did he? Oh, Herbert.

201
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:08,860
 Isn't he also, but with Superman, it's largely the outfit that marks him out.

202
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:14,700
 Yeah, that's why Christopher Reeve, when you know, not in costume, was not mobbed because you look

203
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,980
 over and you see a bloke just in a shirt and trousers and you don't think, oh my God, I'm as mobbed him.

204
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,380
 You look over and you see Superman. You know, that's very exciting.

205
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:24,780
 Herbert Chavez just keeps walking into the Pinewood canteen waiting for people to mob him and go,

206
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:31,260
 another operation then. Oh, dear. Oh, that's so sad.

207
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:41,740
 I've got one more fact, which is that Superman was trained to get fit by Darth Vader.

208
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:47,180
 Right. Okay. What do you mean? Christopher Reeve, when he was getting fit for the movie, was trained by

209
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:52,540
 David Prouse, who was Darth Vader. Oh, my God. Oh, Steve Prouse is the West Country one, isn't he?

210
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:56,380
 Yes. And it looks like we've him doing Darth Lines in the West Country accent, which is the best thing

211
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:01,100
 possibly on the internet. Yes, yeah, because we all know it. So a famous Star Wars thing is that James

212
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:04,940
 Earl Jones became the voice, but there is your right footage where you can actually hear the

213
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:10,700
 West Country accent coming out of Vader's costume. Throw the Rebels out the airlock. It's so good.

214
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:24,060
 Okay, time for fact number three. And that is my fact. My fact is that this year Margaret Atwood

215
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:29,900
 submitted her latest novel and it's going to hit the bookshops in the year 2,114.

216
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:35,660
 God bloody publishes it. I bet she really rushed for that deadline.

217
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:43,580
 Yeah, this is so Margaret Atwood. She's the first author who's a part of a very new project called

218
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:48,700
 the Future Library project. And the idea is that a bunch of novelists for the next 100 years are

219
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:56,060
 going to submit a novel. And in 100 years time, starting from 2014, the first novel hit the

220
00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:02,700
 Shops. It was started by a Scottish artist called Katie, Katie Patterson. She had this idea that

221
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:07,340
 it would be nice to do a long term project. And also the way they're going to publish it is

222
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:12,540
 they're growing a forest out in Oslo in a 100 years time. They'll chop the trees down and they

223
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:16,620
 will be turned into the books. It's so cool. Yeah, it's the big project going on. I read that they're

224
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:20,620
 putting a printing press in the library as well. So make sure that if 100 years we don't have

225
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:23,580
 the printing technology we have today, they can still turn the tree into paper and make sure

226
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:27,020
 those books definitely get ready in a hundred years. That's a good idea. Can you imagine if 100 years

227
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:31,340
 from now we really mess up this planet and we're really low on trees and suddenly they're like well

228
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:35,980
 we're just going to take this forest down. Well then the Margaret Atwood robots with her brain inside

229
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:42,060
 a massive robot comes along and stops people. She says no, these are my trees. That's a very good idea.

230
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:47,100
 The Margaret Atwood robot. I love that. I think she would like it. Yeah, she would. She's a sci-fi writer.

231
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:52,620
 It's such a good and strange idea. But you're right because it's like, it's like people

232
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:58,300
 150 years ago saying well we're going to have this extraordinary telegram competition in 100 years

233
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:02,860
 time and telegrams will be sent all over the world and we have no idea what's going to happen in the

234
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:06,860
 next 100 years. So I like it's optimistic. The printing press is a really good idea. It's not

235
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:09,340
 quite a long time. They'll have an excellent time. Yeah, that's true. So there's a reason what you

236
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:12,620
 can't say well again. Yeah, because when you say it, it sounds very futuristic. But you think

237
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:17,100
 actually 100 years ago we still read novels from 100 years ago, like older than that obviously. But

238
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:21,980
 it could be reading could be the same or it could be completely different. But they also say that

239
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:25,580
 if the world changes like language could be different or there's a thing that people think the

240
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:29,740
 handwriting might start dying out. So just what will people in 100 years be doing and reading and

241
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:34,620
 writing it? Yeah, none of us will know. But it's 100 years. You're right. It's not that long.

242
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:41,100
 Like this year has gone really quick. From a personal perspective, you know,

243
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:46,380
 I just need a few more of those and then you're there. So they said in this project you can submit

244
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:51,340
 anything. You can be like one word. It can be a poem. It can be a novel. That's a very dangerous

245
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:56,620
 idea for authors because they will submit one word. You'd spend about three weeks on that one word when

246
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:03,420
 you, at the end of it, you've got 9% of the forest left. It's, I think it's nice. In 100 years time,

247
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:10,060
 some people somewhere will definitely be reading books as we know them. Well, I read that in 21/15,

248
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:15,020
 which is 100 years in the future, people are predicted that the long maybe 600 language is left

249
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:19,980
 on earth as opposed to today 6,000. Oh god. So whatever language Margaret Atwood's written,

250
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,700
 and then you better hope that's one of them. Yeah. Because you're in English,

251
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:27,020
 presumably English. Yeah. That's awful. Yeah. There must have come a tipping point where the world

252
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:31,740
 stopped gaining languages and started losing them. I don't know. We've got the Avatar language now.

253
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:37,180
 We've got Klingon. We've got, I mean, I've done as that sounds. That is our language. That's not how

254
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:42,620
 Papua New Guinea got its 800 languages by the authors of fantasy novels and making up novels

255
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:47,180
 that people could go to each other at sci-fi conventions. Papua New Guinea is just one massive sci-fi

256
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:53,820
 convention. That's all that's made it through. Yeah. Like Klingon, they teach Klingon. They're

257
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:58,620
 Klingon schools now. It's a language though, but it's a language. I know it's a language, but it's not

258
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:02,700
 language that has developed over thousands of years. Klingon is not a replacement for the hundreds of

259
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,980
 people strange language. No, because we're not going to go over to Papua New Guinea and go,

260
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,780
 sorry to hear that you're losing your languages. We've got a new one for you though. We've got

261
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:14,460
 Dothraki for you. Yeah. I'm not suggesting we replace them. Right. I'm just saying there are new

262
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:20,220
 languages. So you know how Papua New Guinea is famously the place with the most languages. I think

263
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,900
 one in ten of the earth's languages have spoken there or something like that. Yeah, they've

264
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:27,980
 got at least 800. I mean, if you say there are 6,000 then yeah. Yeah, but apparently there are

265
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:33,100
 a few more in New York City or at least it's very close. The number in Papua New Guinea

266
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,980
 compares to the number in New York City. But the Papua New Guinea ones are native,

267
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:41,820
 presumably. In New York is sort of everywhere. Yeah. That's cool. That's very cool. I had to look for

268
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:45,500
 things that haven't been read at the time and I found out that so the World Bank released a lot of

269
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,900
 there, released all the reports of PDFs and they found out they nearly a third of them were never

270
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:55,900
 read. Never. Never. Never downloaded, never read. But the reason I love this story is the report that

271
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:00,860
 said the one reads them was released as a PDF and because this and because this story sort of did

272
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:05,180
 quite well and got a lot of coverage their most read PDF could be the PDF saying that he reads their

273
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:10,460
 PDFs. That's very good. That's brilliant. That's great. So the second author who's going to be

274
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:16,620
 contributing to this project is David Mitchell, the novelist. And there's something about this idea

275
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:20,140
 of submitting something that no one's going to be able to give you feedback on if you're an author.

276
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:25,100
 And I try to be tempting. No reviews. Yeah. No difficult sales for the paperback edition.

277
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:30,300
 I'd still like the advance, obviously. I need to go to the love it.

278
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:35,500
 Well, that's what kind of what happened with Mark Twain's autobiography, wasn't it? Yeah.

279
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,620
 Did he kind of say that no one was allowed to read it for a hundred years or something?

280
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:42,940
 Yeah, he did. I mean, he put a he put it into that was the deal. It could be published a hundred

281
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:46,860
 years after his death. And that is what happened. It's the first two volumes have come out. They're

282
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:51,980
 ginormous and they are. It's only about two years ago, three years ago. They finally got published.

283
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:57,260
 It's currently one Spike Milligan book that yet remains to be published. Spike Milligan can't find a

284
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:07,340
 publisher, right? It's basically Spike Milligan did a bunch of books called "According to." So

285
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:11,740
 Black Beauty, according to Spike Milligan, Treasure Island, hand of the basketballs. He rewrote

286
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:18,460
 the classics. Yeah. Mark Twain's autobiography, according to Spike Milligan. But this one book isn't

287
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:22,860
 at a copyright yet. And the copyright holders have refused to let him do that. So his agent,

288
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:27,980
 Norma Farns, is just holding on to it. And the copyright is going to come up in about 10 years or so.

289
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:32,220
 Right. Then we'll get one more Spike Milligan book. Yeah. That's the other thing about Margaret

290
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:37,100
 Atwood's thing. Doesn't copyright run out 70 years after you die? So she's not going to see any

291
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:43,340
 royalties. Well, she has, exactly. Like her estate won't see anything unless she lives for another 30

292
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:49,260
 years. Right. And she's what? 75 at the moment. Yeah. Yeah. She's intercepted. I guess. She's

293
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:54,380
 invented a thing called the Long Pen. Have you read about this? Yeah. It's just a really long pen.

294
00:22:54,380 --> 00:23:02,220
 A long pen, very different. This is kind of like a futuristic invention. It's the idea that

295
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:07,500
 you can sign on a tablet, but it can appear. It was basically designed for book tours and so on.

296
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:13,020
 If she couldn't physically be in a place. Yeah. So they'll have like a robot arm. And you'll go and

297
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:17,740
 sit next to the robot arm. And then she'll do a Skype chat with you. And you'll say my name's,

298
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:21,980
 you know, Herbert Shabbat's or whatever. I've had dozens of operations to look like you, Margaret.

299
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:30,220
 But no one's mobbing me. And then she'll say, okay, Herbert, I'll sign your book for you. And then

300
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:34,940
 she'll sign it on a tablet. And then the robot arm will come down onto your book and sign exactly

301
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:39,260
 as she signed it. Wow. So rather than just being like, they have the other ones when they can just

302
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:43,340
 do a present signature because it's actually her doing it in real time. Yeah. So if she can't be in

303
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:47,100
 the room in Australia for a book signing, she could do a live Skype chat. And then you can go to a

304
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:51,420
 desk where there's a robot arm. And you can watch her signing it on Skype and the robot's doing it.

305
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:55,820
 I think we've got to be very careful with that kind of thing. And I think the voice of the author,

306
00:23:55,820 --> 00:24:00,700
 whoever it is, should immediately be converted into a metallic robot voice. Thank you for coming to

307
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:05,020
 my signing. It was especially well for like, just to give you a novel signing. So you're like, well,

308
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:09,340
 I'll be there for you. Yeah. Here is Herbert. Yeah. I would. I did.

309
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:12,940
 Well, Robotic Margot Edward, as you were saying earlier, there was a good story in that.

310
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:19,660
 I had a look for authors whose books haven't been, had the later, had been lost. Dr. Zoys,

311
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:23,180
 when they cleared out his attic, I approve of that for the show. I don't just saw a clear,

312
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:29,740
 is that Dr. Seuss to the rest of us? Dr. S-E-U-S-A. Yeah, Dr. Zoys. Dr. Zoys is probably the perfect

313
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:35,100
 pronunciation, yeah. When he died, his busy box of sort of things got put to one side and then

314
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:41,100
 they found it in 2013. Three books, one of which is what pet should I get? I think it's like a fabulous

315
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:47,900
 book. Is it a dog? Is it a frog? I mean, it's a shame that Dr. Zoys has already written this book,

316
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:59,580
 otherwise. Christmas 2015 by the elves. Watch out for it. Okay, time for our final fact and that is

317
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:06,540
 Murray. My fact is that Japan is considering installing toilets in its lifts. Sounds like a plan to

318
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:14,620
 me. Yeah. Does it have very long lift journeys or what? Well, it doesn't, but it does have earthquakes.

319
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:19,660
 Lots of Japan. And when earthquakes happen and lifts get stuck, there are already some little seats

320
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:24,140
 in lifts so that elderly or infirm people can sit down because the last time I happened,

321
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:29,260
 people were stuck for hours in the lifts. And there has been a recent proposal and they haven't

322
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:34,300
 completed it yet, but they might do, which is to fit the seats with little toilets just inside,

323
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:39,020
 sort of, discreetly, so that if they have an enormous earthquake soon in Japan, they've calculated

324
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:43,900
 that up to 17,000 people could be trapped in lifts for some time while they just get everyone out

325
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:49,100
 and clear the buildings and so on. So that is, that would be quite good to have. That would be good.

326
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:57,100
 And then they could collect it all and power a bus. Yeah, that's true. But I was reading the story

327
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:03,100
 that talks about this and they kept referring to the earthquakes as going, we're expecting the big one.

328
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:09,420
 They really think it's imminently coming. This big, ginormous earthquake. But it's definitely

329
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:14,140
 better to be thinking that than thinking it'll be fine. There'll be no earthquakes around there any

330
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:17,500
 times. You know, there are lifts actually already have sensors in them that can detect the beginnings

331
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,700
 of earthquakes. So if they lift the tech, earthquakes coming, they sort of try and stop at a floor

332
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:24,140
 and get people out. They won't carry on. That's clever. That is so amazing.

333
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:29,420
 So clever. X safety mechanisms. Imagine if there's, like, just about to start an earthquake

334
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:33,260
 and then it stops on the floor to let you out, but you're halfway through having to poop.

335
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:41,020
 You're not meant to use it unless it's an earthquake. Oh, all right, okay. People will start using it

336
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:47,260
 for that reason though, right? Surely. Super responsibly. Imagine if you're about to get into a lift

337
00:26:47,260 --> 00:27:00,380
 and someone walks out and goes, I'll give it a few minutes. So the really cool thing about lifts is

338
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:05,180
 they go back really fast. So the Colosseum had lifts, as I'm not sure if we've mentioned that before

339
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:09,820
 actually, but they were hand-powered. Yeah, and they were to get the animals up into the arena, right?

340
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:17,100
 Yeah. But the invention of the lift, or the lift becoming popular, completely changed what people

341
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:21,660
 think of as the best room in a building. So the best rooms in a building used to be on the first floor.

342
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:26,700
 Right. Because if you were wealthy, you didn't want to have to climb loads of stairs. And then suddenly

343
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:30,780
 the lift is invented and people think, oh, it's high up here and there's the sort of extra privilege

344
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:35,740
 of traveling in a lift. You've got a view. You've got a view and it's sort of more naturally exclusive,

345
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:39,900
 but in ancient Roman apartment blocks, the top floor was the port for the poorest.

346
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:45,020
 If you go to the big buildings in America like the richest people would always be on the top floor,

347
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:50,300
 but then after 9/11 they all moved down to the bottom floor. Wow. I believe that's true.

348
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:55,020
 Will that change again over time? I was only told by people at the time that that was happening.

349
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:59,820
 I don't know. Okay. The first generation of skyscrapers were known as elevator buildings.

350
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:04,300
 Were they? Really? That's really nice. They could only really exist because of the elevators

351
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:08,140
 I guess. Yes, they could only go high. And the first lift in London was at the Grovener Hotel,

352
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:13,820
 and it was called the ascending room. That's good. Oh, I heard of that. It sounds amazing.

353
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:18,540
 Yeah, it sounds really cool. Ancient Lesterop and so you know, ropes and simple mechanisms.

354
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:22,940
 And I read that in the Greek meaty aura mountains, they were people in baskets and hooked them

355
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:26,780
 up on ropes. And the story that I've been through asked them how often they change the rope and the

356
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:35,580
 reply was each time that it breaks. Very nice. Will you have confidence in this thing on that?

357
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:40,540
 Have you heard of Paternoster lifts? Yeah. They have one in the Arts Tower in Sheffield University.

358
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:45,580
 Really? Yeah. It's basically two lift shafts open to you without a door,

359
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:51,180
 and then there's a chain of compartments which one is always going up and one is always going down,

360
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:57,420
 right? And they move on a continuous belt, and you just step in as a compartment passes you by,

361
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:01,420
 and it carries you down. Wow. I know. And there are still apparently loads of them in Prague,

362
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:05,500
 because they didn't have quite the same safety standards, basically, during Communist times,

363
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:11,340
 so as they say, we don't need your safety standards. Same in Sheffield. Yeah, and there are some

364
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:15,340
 in Germany, and they're called Paternosters after our father, which is the Lord's Prayer,

365
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:20,220
 right? Because of the way you move rosary beads. Oh, yeah. How cool is that? They sort of click through

366
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:25,020
 up and down, yeah. I don't know that. That's very cool. My favourite thing actually, but this

367
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:28,940
 fact is that it does kind of fit into that thing of Japan, just consistently when you hear

368
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:32,940
 stories of Japan and technology, just feels like they're really cool, and they've got just great

369
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:37,500
 innovations. It's like, yeah, and bathroom stuff seems to be like there's an invention which

370
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:41,580
 is toilet slippers, the idea that you would change your house slippers into toilet slippers,

371
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:46,060
 and you could go in, and then you'd leave them at the toilet. So it's just a quite nice idea,

372
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:51,500
 but just a little inside fact for our show. If you listen to our theme tune right at the beginning

373
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:58,380
 of our show, there's a Japanese voice at the top of our theme tune. That is the voice of a bathtub

374
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:04,140
 in Japan telling the person in the flat that their bathtub is ready, that their bath is run, and it's

375
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:11,100
 ready. So Ash Gardner, who's been on the show and does Empress, he took that recording sitting in

376
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:16,380
 his kitchen of his bath telling him it's ready for him to come, so cool. That's very cool. I also read that

377
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,980
 in Japanese public toilets like in train stations and stuff, have these really cool things like they'll

378
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:23,180
 have like a seat, you've got a baby, you can put your baby in a seat, so you don't sort of balance your

379
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:26,540
 child and go to the toilet. They have like a sort of flip-down board, you can stand on if you want to

380
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:29,900
 change your socks or your shoes, you don't have to stand on the floor, everyone stands on their feet.

381
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:33,820
 That's a good idea. So you just have lots of very smart ideas. Japan is so clever in so many ways,

382
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:37,420
 it's so good. They have to be horrified when they come over here and like go to like waterloo station.

383
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:41,980
 I know. And the thing about removing your shoes is enormous, isn't it? In your own home, you would

384
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:47,180
 just never wear shoes. There's a tiny bit in the entrance hallway where you take your shoes off

385
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:51,180
 and you put on your slippers and then you're in your home. Nice sense. Yeah, it does, absolutely, it does.

386
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:54,940
 Do you know the food you take? So this is Japanese company, claimed to meet the world's smoothest

387
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:59,260
 lifts and they have a thing called the nickel test where they put a nickel or a coin place it starts

388
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:03,500
 facing up on the lift and then they ride it from the top to the bottom. If the coin is still there,

389
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:10,780
 it passes the test. Wait, do you mean on his edge? On his edge. That reminds me, just going back to buses

390
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:16,300
 from all that time ago. In China, they had this drive safely campaign of bus drivers and the way

391
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:22,780
 that they did it is they'd put like hang from the ceiling next to the driver like a walk full of water.

392
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:28,060
 And the idea was you couldn't jerk the bus because then you'd spill the water and that really happened.

393
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:31,740
 That's very good. Quite recently, I think that happened. That's quite smart. Yeah, that's very clever.

394
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:38,060
 The first department store in New York City to have a lift. It promised customers it would take

395
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:47,420
 them to the second floor in 26 seconds. Okay. Today, the lift in the Burjale Khalifa goes 2038 feet in

396
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:54,620
 35 seconds. That's how far we've come in that time. In 1989, the guy called Nicholas White got

397
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:58,940
 trapped in his office for 41 hours after there's a power cut and he got stuck between two floors and

398
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:03,580
 no one noticed him. He ended up having to pee there in the lift shaft, was he hoping to track the tension,

399
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:09,420
 but it didn't. I don't know where he was looking for attention from because no one lives at the bottom

400
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:14,220
 of the lift truck and will be inconvenienced by urine. His story is really sad, though, because it

401
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:20,140
 wrote his life. What? He wrote an article about it and saying because this happened in 1999 and he

402
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:24,300
 sought compensation, basically. Lots of lawyers came waggling, you know, a million figures

403
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:28,620
 sums in front of him. He's spent about five years trying to get compensation and in the end he got sort

404
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:32,460
 of, you know, some compensation, but nothing like the millions that he'd been led to.

405
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:37,500
 It's only 41 hours of overtime. Yeah, well, and then his relationship broke down and he said,

406
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:41,420
 "Oh, no." This is basically ruined my life and I did this to myself. I shouldn't have

407
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:48,620
 gone looking for that and I gave into the temptation. Yeah, really, really sad. Do you know the person

408
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:53,180
 who's got the world record for the longest time stuck in the lift? Was it Nicholas White?

409
00:32:53,180 --> 00:33:00,540
 No, it was a separate lady called Kivoli Papa John. Papa John? Papa John of the

410
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:07,500
 Papa John family. Was she delivery? No, she was going to get her groceries.

411
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:15,020
 Of course she's going to get tomato, some mozzarella, sweet corn, pepperoni. Maybe some pineapple and

412
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:21,660
 tam if she was feeling fun. Well, it's a full name in and of itself, which is why it's not really

413
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:27,980
 a surname as far as I know. But yeah, she went out to get her groceries in December 1987 and she's

414
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:37,020
 but people keep laughing at her about her surname. It's not fair. I think it's a hoax call.

415
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:43,660
 So it's a what happened? She was stuck in her lift in the her apartment block for six days.

416
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:49,180
 But luckily she just been shopping so she had loads of food. Yeah, it was. But when you say she

417
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:54,700
 holds the world record, was that like she was five days in and there we go. Listen, Mrs Papa John,

418
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:59,980
