00:00:13,00:00:19,"Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:19,00:00:23,to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden. My name is Dad Shriver. I'm sitting here
00:00:23,00:00:27,"with Andy Murray, James Harkin, and Ann Miller. And once again, we have gathered around"
00:00:27,00:00:31,"the microphone with our four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular"
00:00:31,00:00:39,"order, here we go. Starting with you, Harkin. My fact this week is that in the 1840s, London"
00:00:39,00:00:44,buses had straps attached to the driver's arms that you would yank if you wanted to stop.
00:00:44,00:00:52,"It just seems like the worst idea in the world. In 1839, they invented the bell on buses,"
00:00:52,00:00:57,"and then they decided to go to the strap version afterwards. So these are horse buses,"
00:00:57,00:01:02,"of course. And in those days, you didn't have to go on the left-hand side of the right-hand"
00:01:02,00:01:06,"side of the road, and there were no bus stops or anything like that. So when you wanted"
00:01:06,00:01:10,"to stop, you needed to tell the driver which direction you wanted to go to the right-hand"
00:01:10,00:01:13,"side of the road or the left-hand side. So if you wanted to stop on the right-hand side,"
00:01:13,00:01:17,"you would yank his right strap, and that would move his right arm, which would move the"
00:01:17,00:01:22,"horse to the side of the road, and then he would stop. I read that they didn't have to even"
00:01:22,00:01:28,"pull over to stop for 40 years after the horse drawn bus was invented. So 1829, I think, was"
00:01:28,00:01:33,"the first one. And there was a new law passed in 1867, which said, ""Really, you should probably"
00:01:33,00:01:37,"pull over to the side of the street before you just stop the bus."" Yeah, until then they"
00:01:37,00:01:40,"would just stop dead. I think the first buses in London, they just did the route, and"
00:01:40,00:01:43,"they would let you on wherever the 70 people could get on, and you just would hail it."
00:01:43,00:01:47,"You weren't stops and things, so I guess they just thought, ""Well, if you let you on anywhere,"
00:01:47,00:01:49,"you can get off."" Yeah, that sounds really good, actually."
00:01:49,00:01:53,How did you used to park when you had a horse attached to your car?
00:01:53,00:01:57,"With parallel parking? Yeah, parallel parking, three-point turns. How's the deal work?"
00:01:57,00:02:00,You would pull your horses off and they would feed or drink what?
00:02:00,00:02:02,Big your butt.
00:02:02,00:02:06,If you were a caring horse owner. You would pull him off to the right if you wanted to.
00:02:06,00:02:09,"The horse had two straps attached to it, actually."
00:02:09,00:02:14,"Okay, that reminds me of another thing about people with straps attached to them, the"
00:02:14,00:02:21,"Huichal Indians of central Mexico. During childbirth, the father would sit above his wife who's"
00:02:21,00:02:26,"giving birth and have a strap attached to his testicles. Whenever she had labor pains,"
00:02:26,00:02:31,she would yank on the strap and yank his testicles so that he would have the same pain as her.
00:02:31,00:02:33,Good child. It hasn't been a great idea.
00:02:33,00:02:37,Oh my god. When did that stop?
00:02:37,00:02:40,It's a traditional thing. I don't think it's happened for hundreds of years.
00:02:40,00:02:41,I don't know why that died out.
00:02:41,00:02:47,Another thing about buses is that driving buses wasn't actually legal until 1832. For the first
00:02:47,00:02:51,"three years, it hadn't been properly regulated or anything. Drivers would chain themselves"
00:02:51,00:02:54,"to their seats, but they were still arrested anyway. They were training themselves to stop"
00:02:54,00:02:57,"being, you know, stopped from driving by the authorities. Yeah."
00:02:57,00:03:00,That's awesome. Isn't that insane?
00:03:00,00:03:03,"After World War I, there weren't that many buses in London, including repurposed during"
00:03:03,00:03:09,World War. So Mr A. Partridge realised that he could make some money by running his own
00:03:09,00:03:13,"buses on the same route so he'd go alongside the official buses, but he would sort of take"
00:03:13,00:03:15,short cuts to avoid traffic and make his buses better.
00:03:15,00:03:16,Oh wow.
00:03:16,00:03:18,And if you often see races between the official bus and then the Pirate bus.
00:03:18,00:03:23,"That's great. When he thought of that idea, he must have gone, ah-ha!"
00:03:23,00:03:24,Back on the net.
00:03:24,00:03:28,"They do that in some other countries. I think in Moscow, they have like unofficial buses"
00:03:28,00:03:31,that you can kind of get on them. They're a little bit cheaper than the official
00:03:31,00:03:34,buses. It's like hustling for mini-cups. It's when it's driving fast.
00:03:34,00:03:38,"St Lucia has those as well, I think. They have sort of, well, they have a range of buses"
00:03:38,00:03:40,"of different levels of officialness, essentially."
00:03:40,00:03:43,Do you guys remember the bendy buses?
00:03:43,00:03:44,Yeah.
00:03:44,00:03:45,Do you know where they are now?
00:03:45,00:03:46,Australia.
00:03:46,00:03:47,"I mean, we have a lot of them in Australia."
00:03:47,00:03:48,I hadn't noticed that they weren't there anymore.
00:03:48,00:03:49,They've got them. Yeah.
00:03:49,00:03:52,So they can't live in some brought them in. Then Boris got rid of them saying they were
00:03:52,00:03:57,"a monstrosity and we didn't want them. So they went to Malta. Malta has very narrow,"
00:03:57,00:04:00,tight roads and they are very difficult to maneuver through traffic. So they were a complete
00:04:00,00:04:04,"disaster, not least because on the day all the drivers went on strike. So they shipped and"
00:04:04,00:04:09,drove us from the UK who didn't know the route or the language. They called us complete chaos.
00:04:09,00:04:14,"And they're called Areva, which is arriving in Italian and they got nicknamed ""Bespetta"","
00:04:14,00:04:18,which means waiting because they were just rubbish. So Malta have now passed them on and
00:04:18,00:04:19,they're now in Sudan.
00:04:19,00:04:25,It's really windy buses. That's unbelievable. That is really interesting.
00:04:25,00:04:28,Do they drive the buses to these places or do they fly them?
00:04:28,00:04:32,I think it's a plane with two straps on and then they start from the ground.
00:04:32,00:04:37,So there's one person who was in Malta who wants to go to Sudan and you're finally the buses
00:04:37,00:04:43,turned up. We wait ages for a bus to Sudan and then all of London's bendy buses come at
00:04:43,00:04:47,"once. Just back in the day where everything was horse-drawn, something that hadn't occurred"
00:04:47,00:04:51,to me and I read in a book the other day is that if you had an emergency and you needed
00:04:51,00:04:57,"a doctor, doctors just used to leap on a horse and ride to the scene. I don't know why that's"
00:04:57,00:05:02,such an amazing image of a doctor speeding down the road on a horse. He had to shout the
00:05:02,00:05:07,word ambulance backwards as he rode.
00:05:07,00:05:11,"I really like this. The double-decker bus was introduced, maybe I think about 20 years"
00:05:11,00:05:15,after the original horse-drawn bus and supposedly it was introduced for the Great Exhibition.
00:05:15,00:05:19,"Before they had a proper staircase, they just had kind of an iron ladder, which was three"
00:05:19,00:05:23,"or four quite high iron steps, but there were also seats available on either side of"
00:05:23,00:05:29,"the driver. There's one book, it's called Transport in Britain from Canal Lock to Gridlock. It"
00:05:29,00:05:33,"says that the seats were hard to get, but they were highly prized by younger passengers"
00:05:33,00:05:38,"because of the driver's great reputation for jokes and witty repartee. So nothing changes,"
00:05:38,00:05:43,does it? It was the original banter bus.
00:05:43,00:05:49,"Here's the thing, here's the best thing I found this week. Who invented the bus? Jack Bus."
00:05:49,00:05:55,"The earliest known public bus line, it was called The Carriage, was launched by Blaise Pascal."
00:05:55,00:05:58,"The mathematician, the mathematician and philosopher, the guy."
00:05:58,00:06:01,"He was a bus company in his first time. I don't know, it's unbelievable, isn't it?"
00:06:01,00:06:05,"How can that even be true? It was unwiccapedia and they checked it out and there's some books,"
00:06:05,00:06:08,some philosophy books about him and apparently it's true.
00:06:08,00:06:13,"That is incredible. I wish I knew more about Blaise Pascal, so I could put that in context."
00:06:13,00:06:20,"Okay, so in mathematics, he did Pascal's Triangle, which is a famous load of numbers in a triangle"
00:06:20,00:06:27,where the two above add to the one below. He has the SI unit of a pressure named after him.
00:06:27,00:06:34,"He wrote a famous book called The Ponce, which was a philosophy book and he was a great French"
00:06:34,00:06:37,"kind of... Transport in 2C. Yeah, but yeah, I mean, he was one of the"
00:06:37,00:06:42,great 17th century French thinkers and he also invented the bus.
00:06:42,00:06:46,That is incredible. How did the bus fall off from his list of achievements?
00:06:46,00:06:49,"Well, it's the one that no one ever talks about these days, really?"
00:06:49,00:06:52,"Yeah, I read a theory and I'm still trying to get to the bottom of this because it sounds"
00:06:52,00:06:58,"like there is some truth to it, but not as much as most articles would suggest."
00:06:58,00:07:03,Do you know why the railroads in this country are the width that they are?
00:07:03,00:07:07,"Yes, it's a stride of a yeti, isn't it?"
00:07:07,00:07:14,"Though it's the idea that obviously when trains were horse-drawn, you had two horses pulling"
00:07:14,00:07:20,the train and the width of the railroads now are the widths of what two horses standing next
00:07:20,00:07:25,"to each other would be. Now that's a theory that apparently in America as well, that with"
00:07:25,00:07:28,"all the railroads, that's how it became. But then different countries have different"
00:07:28,00:07:31,"gauges. Exactly. Yeah, and in fact Britain had two different gauges."
00:07:31,00:07:34,Yeah. And America had 20. This is where the theory falls down slightly.
00:07:34,00:07:38,"Maybe the horses got like fatter in certain states. Yeah, that's true, that's possible."
00:07:38,00:07:43,"Did you put diets? There was a way it could have gone. Oh God, there was an amazing programme"
00:07:43,00:07:45,about this ages and ages ago on the beach. And it was basically saying that there were
00:07:45,00:07:51,"two gauges, a narrow gauge and a broad gauge for trains. And the whole of the country eventually"
00:07:51,00:07:55,"went with the narrow gauge simply because it had spread further and faster, like basically"
00:07:55,00:08:01,"VHS over beatermax, if you'd like. And so now these days we could have these incredible"
00:08:01,00:08:08,"lavish, huge trains, but we don't have to kind of squeeze through the aisle to our coffees"
00:08:08,00:08:12,"and stuff. Exactly. I have a thing about, there was a guide to bus etiquette printed in the"
00:08:12,00:08:18,"times in 1834. I just love this so much. So they're quite similar, like number one, keep"
00:08:18,00:08:22,"your feet off the seats, to do not get into a snug corner yourself and then open the"
00:08:22,00:08:27,windows to admit a north-western upon the neck of your neighbour. A window. Is it weird
00:08:27,00:08:31,when you get on a tube and someone just immediately gets on a tube and opens a window
00:08:31,00:08:35,"without checking the temperature, just goes on, opens a window and says, ""Yes, that is true,"
00:08:35,00:08:41,"that is weird."" Sometimes you get on and it's like walking into an oven. If it's summer,"
00:08:41,00:08:45,it's winter. I get really pissed off by people who open windows. You know how you keep learning
00:08:45,00:08:48,a few things about yourself as the years go on? It's a new thing I've learned very recently.
00:08:48,00:08:53,"If people are opening windows whenever you walk into a room and you bite into the problem,"
00:08:53,00:08:57,"someone else is saying, ""You know what, I've recently found out I hate people who smell bad."""
00:08:57,00:09:04,What can you do? This bus that I get guides then starts to go slightly off the rails of
00:09:04,00:09:08,"where we know. So number six is, ""Do not spit upon the straw. You are not in a hog-stay."""
00:09:08,00:09:13,"Number seven, ""Behave respect for leaf to females and put not on an unprotected last"
00:09:13,00:09:18,"the blush because she cannot escape from your brutality."" Which is very good advice."
00:09:18,00:09:23,"Number eight, ""If you bring a dog, let him be small and confined by a string."" That's"
00:09:23,00:09:29,"like, ""Oh, big dogs are going, please let me be small."" That's like on the underline, isn't"
00:09:29,00:09:39,there's like a rule that you can have a dog on the escrow if you can hold it? So there is
00:09:39,00:09:47,"a bus that goes from Bristol to Bath, which is powered by poo. The biobus and it's powered"
00:09:47,00:09:55,"by bio-mefengast, actually, which comes from from excrement. And it can travel up to 186 miles"
00:09:55,00:10:02,"on one tank of gas. So you're going to say on one poo? Just to try and get out, we're going"
00:10:02,00:10:10,to get six miles. I've got to top it up. It opens up the cap. I've read your eyes.
00:10:10,00:10:16,"No, it can go 186 miles on one tank of gas, which takes the annual waste of around five"
00:10:16,00:10:21,people to produce. So five people have to poo for one year to get one tank of gas.
00:10:21,00:10:27,"Yeah, that's not so bad. Yeah, because I do that every day, not a year's worth, but"
00:10:27,00:10:31,"it's not like I'd have to be like, ""Oh, better poo."" All you'd have to do is just bag what"
00:10:31,00:10:36,"you're doing, right? I see what you mean. I don't know. I'm just saying it's not, it's"
00:10:36,00:10:40,bag what you're doing and posted off to Bristol. They'll be thrilled. The council buildings
00:10:40,00:10:52,"will be fine. Okay, time for fact number two. And that is Miller. My fact is that standing"
00:10:52,00:10:56,like Superman can make you more successful. I love that. Which is why I'm doing it right
00:10:56,00:10:59,now. So explain how can that work? Do we know?
00:10:59,00:11:03,"Okay, so it's a thing called power opposing, which is basically about body language and"
00:11:03,00:11:07,"giving off the right impression. And it's the work of Amy Cuddy, who's a social psychologist"
00:11:07,00:11:11,"at Harvard, who records we should all spend two minutes a day power opposing. So there's"
00:11:11,00:11:15,"lots of various posters you can do, but the best one is superheroes. So hands on hips,"
00:11:15,00:11:19,"chest out, head up, in sort of classic superhero. And people who do this will have increased levels"
00:11:19,00:11:23,"of testosterone, a decrease in cortisol, which is the stress hormone, and feel both more"
00:11:23,00:11:28,powerful and more open to risk. People who take low post reposes have the opposite.
00:11:28,00:11:31,What are low post reposes? Things like slumping in on yourself. It's basically making yourself
00:11:31,00:11:35,"small. So it's thinking if you go to a meeting and you sort of bend your knees, you tuck"
00:11:35,00:11:41,your arms in your head style. Being naked and crying in the corner is a lot of bad impressions
00:11:41,00:11:44,"in job interview. People, they found that people with someone who's doing a powerful pose"
00:11:44,00:11:47,"in a powerful position, rather than copying them, you're more likely, even if you are relatively"
00:11:47,00:11:51,"powerful, to then adopt a weaker stance. By presenting is more confidence, you become"
00:11:51,00:11:56,"more confident. So by being superman, you will become not quite superman, but with superman"
00:11:56,00:12:00,"like power. Well, here's the thing. It also works if you wear superman outfits, partly."
00:12:00,00:12:05,"Yeah, the less effort. So they put students in various different"
00:12:05,00:12:10,"items of clothing and got them to do mental ability tests, and they found that generally people"
00:12:10,00:12:16,are getting about 64%. But people in superman t-shirts were getting 72%. And also people wearing
00:12:16,00:12:21,"white coats did better as well. Oh, this one's interesting, because wearing a love coat makes"
00:12:21,00:12:25,"you better, but they're taking love coats away for doctors. So they have to done doing superman"
00:12:25,00:12:29,"poses of counterbalances. Otherwise, it's going to be because the doctors will perform"
00:12:29,00:12:34,really because they're wearing the wrong outfit. The costume thing also actually works for Christopher
00:12:34,00:12:40,"Reeve. There's a story in Roger Moore's autobiography where while they were filming the movie, Christopher"
00:12:40,00:12:44,"Reeve during breaks where he couldn't get out of his clothes, if it was lunchtime, would go to the Pinewood"
00:12:44,00:12:49,"Studios canteen, which is where they were filming. And if he went out in his superman costume, he was just"
00:12:49,00:12:54,"swarmed, girls coming around, swarming around him, just totally in love with him. If he came out during"
00:12:54,00:13:02,"the Clark Kent scenes, just no one came near him, he was just left alone. I think this is really good."
00:13:02,00:13:06,I really like this. I'm going to start doing this power-posing. We still all the time. You don't have
00:13:06,00:13:09,"to do it front of people. You can do it for two minutes when you got up in the morning. Yeah,"
00:13:09,00:13:14,I want to do that. I want to do those benefits with you. There is one bad thing about wearing superman
00:13:14,00:13:19,"costumes, and that is if you're a child, because apparently superhero costumes cause children to hurt"
00:13:19,00:13:26,"themselves, because they start doing playing, which is a bit like they try and fly stuff like that. Do"
00:13:26,00:13:32,"you guys know that Superman was originally evil? No, he wasn't. No, I don't know. Well, you could take"
00:13:32,00:13:37,"out with Jerry Siegel and Joe Strister, who came up with Superman. In 1932, they did a story called"
00:13:37,00:13:42,"""The Rain of the Superman"" about a homeless man called Bill Dunn, who was transformed by a mad"
00:13:42,00:13:46,"scientist who used a secret chemical to help him be able to read and control minds. The Superman,"
00:13:46,00:13:51,"with these new powers, kills his creator and starts playing the stock market and winning races to get"
00:13:51,00:13:55,rich enough to take over the world and then loses it all. Is that because he likes risk because he's
00:13:55,00:13:59,"been doing these power-poses that he's playing the stock market? Yeah, I think that's what happens."
00:13:59,00:14:06,And then obviously they rewrote him and he was nicer. Different. And an alien and not an insane
00:14:06,00:14:11,"word to regard him the way. Wow. I was thought by the way that anytime I saw a portrait of Henry VIII,"
00:14:11,00:14:15,"that he was adopting a Superman pose. Yeah. Yeah, he does make himself look nice. That's true. I wonder"
00:14:15,00:14:19,how many people from history is that where that pose was inspired by. Please don't make that a tumbler.
00:14:19,00:14:24,"A superhero history. Yes, Superman poses in history. Oh, that's a really good idea."
00:14:24,00:14:30,"Okay, there's a guy. There was a newspaper article I read about Superman and it said something like"
00:14:30,00:14:34,"this. When Clark Kent wanted to transform into Superman, it was a fairly simple task. He would"
00:14:34,00:14:41,"step into a phone box, spin around and the switch would be complete. For Herbert Chavez, his change"
00:14:41,00:14:48,"into the comic book was taken a bit longer through 16 years of plastic surgery. Oh, my God."
00:14:48,00:14:54,"And yeah, he's had plastic surgery to make him look like Superman. Oh, but you're beautiful as you are."
00:14:54,00:14:59,"Just do the posture, that's enough. He doesn't really look that much like Superman, to be honest."
00:14:59,00:15:04,"Yeah. Do you mean before or after he doesn't look like? In neither case, did he? Oh, Herbert."
00:15:04,00:15:08,"Isn't he also, but with Superman, it's largely the outfit that marks him out."
00:15:08,00:15:14,"Yeah, that's why Christopher Reeve, when you know, not in costume, was not mobbed because you look"
00:15:14,00:15:17,"over and you see a bloke just in a shirt and trousers and you don't think, oh my God, I'm as mobbed him."
00:15:17,00:15:20,"You look over and you see Superman. You know, that's very exciting."
00:15:20,00:15:24,"Herbert Chavez just keeps walking into the Pinewood canteen waiting for people to mob him and go,"
00:15:24,00:15:31,"another operation then. Oh, dear. Oh, that's so sad."
00:15:33,00:15:41,"I've got one more fact, which is that Superman was trained to get fit by Darth Vader."
00:15:41,00:15:47,"Right. Okay. What do you mean? Christopher Reeve, when he was getting fit for the movie, was trained by"
00:15:47,00:15:52,"David Prouse, who was Darth Vader. Oh, my God. Oh, Steve Prouse is the West Country one, isn't he?"
00:15:52,00:15:56,"Yes. And it looks like we've him doing Darth Lines in the West Country accent, which is the best thing"
00:15:56,00:16:01,"possibly on the internet. Yes, yeah, because we all know it. So a famous Star Wars thing is that James"
00:16:01,00:16:04,"Earl Jones became the voice, but there is your right footage where you can actually hear the"
00:16:04,00:16:10,West Country accent coming out of Vader's costume. Throw the Rebels out the airlock. It's so good.
00:16:10,00:16:24,"Okay, time for fact number three. And that is my fact. My fact is that this year Margaret Atwood"
00:16:24,00:16:29,"submitted her latest novel and it's going to hit the bookshops in the year 2,114."
00:16:30,00:16:35,God bloody publishes it. I bet she really rushed for that deadline.
00:16:35,00:16:43,"Yeah, this is so Margaret Atwood. She's the first author who's a part of a very new project called"
00:16:43,00:16:48,the Future Library project. And the idea is that a bunch of novelists for the next 100 years are
00:16:48,00:16:56,"going to submit a novel. And in 100 years time, starting from 2014, the first novel hit the"
00:16:56,00:17:02,"Shops. It was started by a Scottish artist called Katie, Katie Patterson. She had this idea that"
00:17:02,00:17:07,it would be nice to do a long term project. And also the way they're going to publish it is
00:17:07,00:17:12,they're growing a forest out in Oslo in a 100 years time. They'll chop the trees down and they
00:17:12,00:17:16,"will be turned into the books. It's so cool. Yeah, it's the big project going on. I read that they're"
00:17:16,00:17:20,putting a printing press in the library as well. So make sure that if 100 years we don't have
00:17:20,00:17:23,"the printing technology we have today, they can still turn the tree into paper and make sure"
00:17:23,00:17:27,those books definitely get ready in a hundred years. That's a good idea. Can you imagine if 100 years
00:17:27,00:17:31,from now we really mess up this planet and we're really low on trees and suddenly they're like well
00:17:31,00:17:35,we're just going to take this forest down. Well then the Margaret Atwood robots with her brain inside
00:17:35,00:17:42,"a massive robot comes along and stops people. She says no, these are my trees. That's a very good idea."
00:17:42,00:17:47,"The Margaret Atwood robot. I love that. I think she would like it. Yeah, she would. She's a sci-fi writer."
00:17:47,00:17:52,"It's such a good and strange idea. But you're right because it's like, it's like people"
00:17:52,00:17:58,150 years ago saying well we're going to have this extraordinary telegram competition in 100 years
00:17:58,00:18:02,time and telegrams will be sent all over the world and we have no idea what's going to happen in the
00:18:02,00:18:06,next 100 years. So I like it's optimistic. The printing press is a really good idea. It's not
00:18:06,00:18:09,"quite a long time. They'll have an excellent time. Yeah, that's true. So there's a reason what you"
00:18:09,00:18:12,"can't say well again. Yeah, because when you say it, it sounds very futuristic. But you think"
00:18:12,00:18:17,"actually 100 years ago we still read novels from 100 years ago, like older than that obviously. But"
00:18:17,00:18:21,it could be reading could be the same or it could be completely different. But they also say that
00:18:21,00:18:25,if the world changes like language could be different or there's a thing that people think the
00:18:25,00:18:29,handwriting might start dying out. So just what will people in 100 years be doing and reading and
00:18:29,00:18:34,"writing it? Yeah, none of us will know. But it's 100 years. You're right. It's not that long."
00:18:34,00:18:41,"Like this year has gone really quick. From a personal perspective, you know,"
00:18:41,00:18:46,I just need a few more of those and then you're there. So they said in this project you can submit
00:18:46,00:18:51,anything. You can be like one word. It can be a poem. It can be a novel. That's a very dangerous
00:18:51,00:18:56,idea for authors because they will submit one word. You'd spend about three weeks on that one word when
00:18:56,00:19:03,"you, at the end of it, you've got 9% of the forest left. It's, I think it's nice. In 100 years time,"
00:19:03,00:19:10,"some people somewhere will definitely be reading books as we know them. Well, I read that in 21/15,"
00:19:10,00:19:15,"which is 100 years in the future, people are predicted that the long maybe 600 language is left"
00:19:15,00:19:19,"on earth as opposed to today 6,000. Oh god. So whatever language Margaret Atwood's written,"
00:19:19,00:19:22,"and then you better hope that's one of them. Yeah. Because you're in English,"
00:19:22,00:19:27,presumably English. Yeah. That's awful. Yeah. There must have come a tipping point where the world
00:19:27,00:19:31,stopped gaining languages and started losing them. I don't know. We've got the Avatar language now.
00:19:31,00:19:37,"We've got Klingon. We've got, I mean, I've done as that sounds. That is our language. That's not how"
00:19:37,00:19:42,Papua New Guinea got its 800 languages by the authors of fantasy novels and making up novels
00:19:42,00:19:47,that people could go to each other at sci-fi conventions. Papua New Guinea is just one massive sci-fi
00:19:47,00:19:53,"convention. That's all that's made it through. Yeah. Like Klingon, they teach Klingon. They're"
00:19:53,00:19:58,"Klingon schools now. It's a language though, but it's a language. I know it's a language, but it's not"
00:19:58,00:20:02,language that has developed over thousands of years. Klingon is not a replacement for the hundreds of
00:20:02,00:20:05,"people strange language. No, because we're not going to go over to Papua New Guinea and go,"
00:20:05,00:20:08,sorry to hear that you're losing your languages. We've got a new one for you though. We've got
00:20:08,00:20:14,Dothraki for you. Yeah. I'm not suggesting we replace them. Right. I'm just saying there are new
00:20:14,00:20:20,languages. So you know how Papua New Guinea is famously the place with the most languages. I think
00:20:20,00:20:23,"one in ten of the earth's languages have spoken there or something like that. Yeah, they've"
00:20:23,00:20:27,"got at least 800. I mean, if you say there are 6,000 then yeah. Yeah, but apparently there are"
00:20:27,00:20:33,a few more in New York City or at least it's very close. The number in Papua New Guinea
00:20:33,00:20:35,"compares to the number in New York City. But the Papua New Guinea ones are native,"
00:20:35,00:20:41,presumably. In New York is sort of everywhere. Yeah. That's cool. That's very cool. I had to look for
00:20:41,00:20:45,things that haven't been read at the time and I found out that so the World Bank released a lot of
00:20:45,00:20:49,"there, released all the reports of PDFs and they found out they nearly a third of them were never"
00:20:49,00:20:55,"read. Never. Never. Never downloaded, never read. But the reason I love this story is the report that"
00:20:55,00:21:00,said the one reads them was released as a PDF and because this and because this story sort of did
00:21:00,00:21:05,quite well and got a lot of coverage their most read PDF could be the PDF saying that he reads their
00:21:05,00:21:10,PDFs. That's very good. That's brilliant. That's great. So the second author who's going to be
00:21:10,00:21:16,"contributing to this project is David Mitchell, the novelist. And there's something about this idea"
00:21:16,00:21:20,of submitting something that no one's going to be able to give you feedback on if you're an author.
00:21:20,00:21:25,And I try to be tempting. No reviews. Yeah. No difficult sales for the paperback edition.
00:21:25,00:21:30,"I'd still like the advance, obviously. I need to go to the love it."
00:21:30,00:21:35,"Well, that's what kind of what happened with Mark Twain's autobiography, wasn't it? Yeah."
00:21:35,00:21:38,Did he kind of say that no one was allowed to read it for a hundred years or something?
00:21:38,00:21:42,"Yeah, he did. I mean, he put a he put it into that was the deal. It could be published a hundred"
00:21:42,00:21:46,years after his death. And that is what happened. It's the first two volumes have come out. They're
00:21:46,00:21:51,"ginormous and they are. It's only about two years ago, three years ago. They finally got published."
00:21:51,00:21:57,It's currently one Spike Milligan book that yet remains to be published. Spike Milligan can't find a
00:21:57,00:22:07,"publisher, right? It's basically Spike Milligan did a bunch of books called ""According to."" So"
00:22:07,00:22:11,"Black Beauty, according to Spike Milligan, Treasure Island, hand of the basketballs. He rewrote"
00:22:11,00:22:18,"the classics. Yeah. Mark Twain's autobiography, according to Spike Milligan. But this one book isn't"
00:22:18,00:22:22,"at a copyright yet. And the copyright holders have refused to let him do that. So his agent,"
00:22:22,00:22:27,"Norma Farns, is just holding on to it. And the copyright is going to come up in about 10 years or so."
00:22:27,00:22:32,Right. Then we'll get one more Spike Milligan book. Yeah. That's the other thing about Margaret
00:22:32,00:22:37,Atwood's thing. Doesn't copyright run out 70 years after you die? So she's not going to see any
00:22:37,00:22:43,"royalties. Well, she has, exactly. Like her estate won't see anything unless she lives for another 30"
00:22:43,00:22:49,years. Right. And she's what? 75 at the moment. Yeah. Yeah. She's intercepted. I guess. She's
00:22:49,00:22:54,invented a thing called the Long Pen. Have you read about this? Yeah. It's just a really long pen.
00:22:54,00:23:02,"A long pen, very different. This is kind of like a futuristic invention. It's the idea that"
00:23:02,00:23:07,"you can sign on a tablet, but it can appear. It was basically designed for book tours and so on."
00:23:07,00:23:13,If she couldn't physically be in a place. Yeah. So they'll have like a robot arm. And you'll go and
00:23:13,00:23:17,"sit next to the robot arm. And then she'll do a Skype chat with you. And you'll say my name's,"
00:23:17,00:23:21,"you know, Herbert Shabbat's or whatever. I've had dozens of operations to look like you, Margaret."
00:23:21,00:23:30,"But no one's mobbing me. And then she'll say, okay, Herbert, I'll sign your book for you. And then"
00:23:30,00:23:34,she'll sign it on a tablet. And then the robot arm will come down onto your book and sign exactly
00:23:34,00:23:39,"as she signed it. Wow. So rather than just being like, they have the other ones when they can just"
00:23:39,00:23:43,do a present signature because it's actually her doing it in real time. Yeah. So if she can't be in
00:23:43,00:23:47,"the room in Australia for a book signing, she could do a live Skype chat. And then you can go to a"
00:23:47,00:23:51,desk where there's a robot arm. And you can watch her signing it on Skype and the robot's doing it.
00:23:51,00:23:55,"I think we've got to be very careful with that kind of thing. And I think the voice of the author,"
00:23:55,00:24:00,"whoever it is, should immediately be converted into a metallic robot voice. Thank you for coming to"
00:24:00,00:24:05,"my signing. It was especially well for like, just to give you a novel signing. So you're like, well,"
00:24:05,00:24:09,I'll be there for you. Yeah. Here is Herbert. Yeah. I would. I did.
00:24:09,00:24:12,"Well, Robotic Margot Edward, as you were saying earlier, there was a good story in that."
00:24:12,00:24:19,"I had a look for authors whose books haven't been, had the later, had been lost. Dr. Zoys,"
00:24:19,00:24:23,"when they cleared out his attic, I approve of that for the show. I don't just saw a clear,"
00:24:23,00:24:29,"is that Dr. Seuss to the rest of us? Dr. S-E-U-S-A. Yeah, Dr. Zoys. Dr. Zoys is probably the perfect"
00:24:29,00:24:35,"pronunciation, yeah. When he died, his busy box of sort of things got put to one side and then"
00:24:35,00:24:41,"they found it in 2013. Three books, one of which is what pet should I get? I think it's like a fabulous"
00:24:41,00:24:47,"book. Is it a dog? Is it a frog? I mean, it's a shame that Dr. Zoys has already written this book,"
00:24:47,00:24:59,"otherwise. Christmas 2015 by the elves. Watch out for it. Okay, time for our final fact and that is"
00:24:59,00:25:06,Murray. My fact is that Japan is considering installing toilets in its lifts. Sounds like a plan to
00:25:06,00:25:14,"me. Yeah. Does it have very long lift journeys or what? Well, it doesn't, but it does have earthquakes."
00:25:14,00:25:19,"Lots of Japan. And when earthquakes happen and lifts get stuck, there are already some little seats"
00:25:19,00:25:24,"in lifts so that elderly or infirm people can sit down because the last time I happened,"
00:25:24,00:25:29,people were stuck for hours in the lifts. And there has been a recent proposal and they haven't
00:25:29,00:25:34,"completed it yet, but they might do, which is to fit the seats with little toilets just inside,"
00:25:34,00:25:39,"sort of, discreetly, so that if they have an enormous earthquake soon in Japan, they've calculated"
00:25:39,00:25:43,"that up to 17,000 people could be trapped in lifts for some time while they just get everyone out"
00:25:43,00:25:49,"and clear the buildings and so on. So that is, that would be quite good to have. That would be good."
00:25:49,00:25:57,"And then they could collect it all and power a bus. Yeah, that's true. But I was reading the story"
00:25:57,00:26:03,"that talks about this and they kept referring to the earthquakes as going, we're expecting the big one."
00:26:03,00:26:09,"They really think it's imminently coming. This big, ginormous earthquake. But it's definitely"
00:26:09,00:26:14,better to be thinking that than thinking it'll be fine. There'll be no earthquakes around there any
00:26:14,00:26:17,"times. You know, there are lifts actually already have sensors in them that can detect the beginnings"
00:26:17,00:26:20,"of earthquakes. So if they lift the tech, earthquakes coming, they sort of try and stop at a floor"
00:26:20,00:26:24,and get people out. They won't carry on. That's clever. That is so amazing.
00:26:24,00:26:29,"So clever. X safety mechanisms. Imagine if there's, like, just about to start an earthquake"
00:26:29,00:26:33,"and then it stops on the floor to let you out, but you're halfway through having to poop."
00:26:34,00:26:41,"You're not meant to use it unless it's an earthquake. Oh, all right, okay. People will start using it"
00:26:41,00:26:47,"for that reason though, right? Surely. Super responsibly. Imagine if you're about to get into a lift"
00:26:47,00:27:00,"and someone walks out and goes, I'll give it a few minutes. So the really cool thing about lifts is"
00:27:00,00:27:05,"they go back really fast. So the Colosseum had lifts, as I'm not sure if we've mentioned that before"
00:27:05,00:27:09,"actually, but they were hand-powered. Yeah, and they were to get the animals up into the arena, right?"
00:27:09,00:27:17,"Yeah. But the invention of the lift, or the lift becoming popular, completely changed what people"
00:27:17,00:27:21,think of as the best room in a building. So the best rooms in a building used to be on the first floor.
00:27:21,00:27:26,"Right. Because if you were wealthy, you didn't want to have to climb loads of stairs. And then suddenly"
00:27:26,00:27:30,"the lift is invented and people think, oh, it's high up here and there's the sort of extra privilege"
00:27:30,00:27:35,"of traveling in a lift. You've got a view. You've got a view and it's sort of more naturally exclusive,"
00:27:35,00:27:39,"but in ancient Roman apartment blocks, the top floor was the port for the poorest."
00:27:39,00:27:45,"If you go to the big buildings in America like the richest people would always be on the top floor,"
00:27:45,00:27:50,but then after 9/11 they all moved down to the bottom floor. Wow. I believe that's true.
00:27:50,00:27:55,Will that change again over time? I was only told by people at the time that that was happening.
00:27:55,00:27:59,I don't know. Okay. The first generation of skyscrapers were known as elevator buildings.
00:27:59,00:28:04,Were they? Really? That's really nice. They could only really exist because of the elevators
00:28:04,00:28:08,"I guess. Yes, they could only go high. And the first lift in London was at the Grovener Hotel,"
00:28:08,00:28:13,"and it was called the ascending room. That's good. Oh, I heard of that. It sounds amazing."
00:28:13,00:28:18,"Yeah, it sounds really cool. Ancient Lesterop and so you know, ropes and simple mechanisms."
00:28:18,00:28:22,"And I read that in the Greek meaty aura mountains, they were people in baskets and hooked them"
00:28:22,00:28:26,up on ropes. And the story that I've been through asked them how often they change the rope and the
00:28:26,00:28:35,reply was each time that it breaks. Very nice. Will you have confidence in this thing on that?
00:28:35,00:28:40,Have you heard of Paternoster lifts? Yeah. They have one in the Arts Tower in Sheffield University.
00:28:40,00:28:45,"Really? Yeah. It's basically two lift shafts open to you without a door,"
00:28:45,00:28:51,"and then there's a chain of compartments which one is always going up and one is always going down,"
00:28:51,00:28:57,"right? And they move on a continuous belt, and you just step in as a compartment passes you by,"
00:28:57,00:29:01,"and it carries you down. Wow. I know. And there are still apparently loads of them in Prague,"
00:29:01,00:29:05,"because they didn't have quite the same safety standards, basically, during Communist times,"
00:29:05,00:29:11,"so as they say, we don't need your safety standards. Same in Sheffield. Yeah, and there are some"
00:29:11,00:29:15,"in Germany, and they're called Paternosters after our father, which is the Lord's Prayer,"
00:29:15,00:29:20,"right? Because of the way you move rosary beads. Oh, yeah. How cool is that? They sort of click through"
00:29:20,00:29:25,"up and down, yeah. I don't know that. That's very cool. My favourite thing actually, but this"
00:29:25,00:29:28,"fact is that it does kind of fit into that thing of Japan, just consistently when you hear"
00:29:28,00:29:32,"stories of Japan and technology, just feels like they're really cool, and they've got just great"
00:29:32,00:29:37,"innovations. It's like, yeah, and bathroom stuff seems to be like there's an invention which"
00:29:37,00:29:41,"is toilet slippers, the idea that you would change your house slippers into toilet slippers,"
00:29:41,00:29:46,"and you could go in, and then you'd leave them at the toilet. So it's just a quite nice idea,"
00:29:46,00:29:51,but just a little inside fact for our show. If you listen to our theme tune right at the beginning
00:29:51,00:29:58,"of our show, there's a Japanese voice at the top of our theme tune. That is the voice of a bathtub"
00:29:58,00:30:04,"in Japan telling the person in the flat that their bathtub is ready, that their bath is run, and it's"
00:30:04,00:30:11,"ready. So Ash Gardner, who's been on the show and does Empress, he took that recording sitting in"
00:30:11,00:30:16,"his kitchen of his bath telling him it's ready for him to come, so cool. That's very cool. I also read that"
00:30:16,00:30:19,"in Japanese public toilets like in train stations and stuff, have these really cool things like they'll"
00:30:19,00:30:23,"have like a seat, you've got a baby, you can put your baby in a seat, so you don't sort of balance your"
00:30:23,00:30:26,"child and go to the toilet. They have like a sort of flip-down board, you can stand on if you want to"
00:30:26,00:30:29,"change your socks or your shoes, you don't have to stand on the floor, everyone stands on their feet."
00:30:29,00:30:33,"That's a good idea. So you just have lots of very smart ideas. Japan is so clever in so many ways,"
00:30:33,00:30:37,it's so good. They have to be horrified when they come over here and like go to like waterloo station.
00:30:37,00:30:41,"I know. And the thing about removing your shoes is enormous, isn't it? In your own home, you would"
00:30:41,00:30:47,just never wear shoes. There's a tiny bit in the entrance hallway where you take your shoes off
00:30:47,00:30:51,"and you put on your slippers and then you're in your home. Nice sense. Yeah, it does, absolutely, it does."
00:30:51,00:30:54,"Do you know the food you take? So this is Japanese company, claimed to meet the world's smoothest"
00:30:54,00:30:59,lifts and they have a thing called the nickel test where they put a nickel or a coin place it starts
00:30:59,00:31:03,"facing up on the lift and then they ride it from the top to the bottom. If the coin is still there,"
00:31:03,00:31:10,"it passes the test. Wait, do you mean on his edge? On his edge. That reminds me, just going back to buses"
00:31:10,00:31:16,"from all that time ago. In China, they had this drive safely campaign of bus drivers and the way"
00:31:16,00:31:22,that they did it is they'd put like hang from the ceiling next to the driver like a walk full of water.
00:31:22,00:31:28,And the idea was you couldn't jerk the bus because then you'd spill the water and that really happened.
00:31:28,00:31:31,"That's very good. Quite recently, I think that happened. That's quite smart. Yeah, that's very clever."
00:31:31,00:31:38,The first department store in New York City to have a lift. It promised customers it would take
00:31:38,00:31:47,"them to the second floor in 26 seconds. Okay. Today, the lift in the Burjale Khalifa goes 2038 feet in"
00:31:47,00:31:54,"35 seconds. That's how far we've come in that time. In 1989, the guy called Nicholas White got"
00:31:54,00:31:58,trapped in his office for 41 hours after there's a power cut and he got stuck between two floors and
00:31:58,00:32:03,"no one noticed him. He ended up having to pee there in the lift shaft, was he hoping to track the tension,"
00:32:03,00:32:09,but it didn't. I don't know where he was looking for attention from because no one lives at the bottom
00:32:09,00:32:14,"of the lift truck and will be inconvenienced by urine. His story is really sad, though, because it"
00:32:14,00:32:20,wrote his life. What? He wrote an article about it and saying because this happened in 1999 and he
00:32:20,00:32:24,"sought compensation, basically. Lots of lawyers came waggling, you know, a million figures"
00:32:24,00:32:28,sums in front of him. He's spent about five years trying to get compensation and in the end he got sort
00:32:28,00:32:32,"of, you know, some compensation, but nothing like the millions that he'd been led to."
00:32:32,00:32:37,"It's only 41 hours of overtime. Yeah, well, and then his relationship broke down and he said,"
00:32:37,00:32:41,"""Oh, no."" This is basically ruined my life and I did this to myself. I shouldn't have"
00:32:41,00:32:48,"gone looking for that and I gave into the temptation. Yeah, really, really sad. Do you know the person"
00:32:48,00:32:53,who's got the world record for the longest time stuck in the lift? Was it Nicholas White?
00:32:53,00:33:00,"No, it was a separate lady called Kivoli Papa John. Papa John? Papa John of the"
00:33:00,00:33:07,"Papa John family. Was she delivery? No, she was going to get her groceries."
00:33:07,00:33:15,"Of course she's going to get tomato, some mozzarella, sweet corn, pepperoni. Maybe some pineapple and"
00:33:15,00:33:21,"tam if she was feeling fun. Well, it's a full name in and of itself, which is why it's not really"
00:33:21,00:33:27,"a surname as far as I know. But yeah, she went out to get her groceries in December 1987 and she's"
00:33:27,00:33:37,but people keep laughing at her about her surname. It's not fair. I think it's a hoax call.
00:33:37,00:33:43,So it's a what happened? She was stuck in her lift in the her apartment block for six days.
00:33:43,00:33:49,"But luckily she just been shopping so she had loads of food. Yeah, it was. But when you say she"
00:33:49,00:33:54,"holds the world record, was that like she was five days in and there we go. Listen, Mrs Papa John,"
00:33:54,00:33:59,we've got Guinness coming. Hold on for a bit longer and we reckon we could get a really good record.
00:33:59,00:34:05,She holding the door shut with her trying to come on. I need one more hour in here and I get the record.
00:34:05,00:34:14,"Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening. If you'd like to get in"
