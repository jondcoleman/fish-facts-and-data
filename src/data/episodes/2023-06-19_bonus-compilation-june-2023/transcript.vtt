00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.440
 - Hey, Club Fishers, Dan here.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.020
 Welcome to your secret bonus bit of content.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.680
 We have a compilation for you this week,

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:13.520
 which is quite exciting,

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.120
 'cause we haven't done a compilation in ages.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.280
 And actually, as a result of not having done it

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.560
 for such a long time, there's a huge backlog.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.920
 We have so much unused archive.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.160
 And what you're gonna get today is a special one

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.680
 because it's gonna be populated entirely

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.520
 in every single clip with an old friend of the show,

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.440
 very familiar voice,

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.280
 but I think you're gonna be quite excited to hear again.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.200
 She's a good one.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.580
 So I hope you enjoy it.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.920
 And also just wanna quickly say thank you

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.200
 to everyone who's bought tickets to come see us

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.120
 at the Soho Theater for both July and August.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.440
 We're doing 11 shows each night with a new special guest.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.560
 And they're basically sold out every single show.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.680
 There's only a few tickets remaining.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.100
 And if you want to try and come to one of those,

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.920
 then please head to knowsuchthingasafish.com/live.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.400
 And you'll find the link there to the Soho Theater

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.120
 and you'll be able to get the tickets.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.880
 However, if you can't make that,

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.040
 but you're thinking, "But I am in London in September."

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.880
 Well, good news.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.080
 We're very excited to announce

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.400
 that we are gonna be once again

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.200
 playing the London Podcast Festival.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.680
 This happens at King's Place.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.200
 It's such a fun event

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.800
 because all the British podcasts get to come together

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.120
 and do their live shows.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.680
 And we get to be one of them.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.500
 And if you wanna come see that,

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.140
 we're gonna be doing that on the 14th of September

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.780
 at 7 p.m.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.580
 So all you need to do is go to

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.340
 knowsuchthingasafish.com/podfest

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.900
 and you'll be able to get tickets there.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.020
 I would do that ASAP

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.420
 because we haven't announced this anywhere else yet.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.620
 It's gonna be announced on the main show on Friday.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.180
 So you've got a few days to get in there early

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.940
 and snap up all the tickets.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.780
 If you're thinking, "God damn it, another London show.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.700
 When am I gonna be able to see fish outside of there?"

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.020
 We're very sorry.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.840
 This is just how it has to be for the moment,

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.440
 except for the fact to say

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.880
 that this show is gonna be streamed online.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:00.920
 So you could be anywhere,

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.280
 anywhere in the world and watch it.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.280
 So all you need to do is head to that link,

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.160
 knowsuchthingasafish.com/podfest

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.960
 and you will be able to buy

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.220
 an option for online streaming.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.680
 So go and do that.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.400
 Buy tickets to the live show itself.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.920
 If you do happen to be in London,

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.840
 we love doing these London Podcast Fest shows.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.000
 They're really, really funny.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.920
 They're full of facts,

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.500
 dorkery, bad puns and more, as it says in the briefing.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.860
 And hopefully we'll see some of you there.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.300
 Otherwise, please enjoy this bonus bit of content

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.100
 with our good mate, Anna Tyshinski.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.180
 - I was talking to someone about

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.820
 a blood transfusion the other day

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.780
 and she was saying that afterwards,

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.860
 the energy, this kind of revitalize,

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.500
 she was like, "I felt like I was 20 again."

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.100
 I was just like, "I wonder if it gives the--"

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.940
 - Was it the queen?

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:47.780
 - Yeah. - You were talking too.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.580
 (laughing)

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.120
 - And she has lizard blood, which is extremely,

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.160
 yeah, you'd really get a kick off that.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.240
 - Another animal that drinks blood is the lamprey, the fish.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.080
 Supposedly the most bloodthirsty of all the fish,

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.880
 according to a Michigan newspaper in 1955.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.380
 - That's a very honest of you to say.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.240
 - Well, I thought it was quite a strong claim.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.360
 But anyway, lots of royals and stuff

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.840
 would eat lampries, right?

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.440
 - Was it Henry II?

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.280
 - I mean, the first, I think.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.120
 - The first?

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.960
 - The first surfeit of lampries.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.080
 - He died from a surfeit of lampries.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.440
 But in all the jubilee celebrations throughout history,

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.960
 they've always had lamprey pie in Britain.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.900
 And Queen Elizabeth's platinum jubilee was the first,

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.020
 since records began, that didn't have lamprey pie.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.120
 And that's because lampries are kind of endangered

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.480
 at the moment, especially in Europe.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.240
 It's really hard to get hold of lampries.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.920
 - For her diamond jubilee in 2012, they had lamprey pie,

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.160
 but they brought the lampries in from North America

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.960
 where they're slightly less endangered.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.600
 - But I can't believe they were still making lamprey pie,

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.600
 which sounds like an incredibly old fashioned

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.720
 18th century thing.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.320
 - Well, lampries still exist and pies still exist, right?

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.760
 - Yeah, but you don't, it's not on as many menus

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.200
 as it was in the 1600s.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.600
 Let's face it, I've never had lamprey pie.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.200
 - I can't picture a lamprey, by the way.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.840
 - It's like an eel, but then if you look at its face,

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.640
 it looks like an alien from a movie.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.200
 - It's like a sea leech, basically.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.840
 They're just long, gross tubes with nasty mouths.

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:21.840
 - But like the mouth is...

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:22.680
 - Yes, I know them now.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.200
 - Right, so for the listener, they don't have a jaw,

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.320
 so they don't have a normal mouth

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.680
 that goes snap, snap, snap like ours,

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.400
 but they've got a perfect circle,

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.120
 and then it's covered in teeth,

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.320
 and then also they've got a tongue,

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.120
 which is also covered in teeth.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.600
 And so the way they suck blood,

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.840
 and they suck a hell of a lot, don't they?

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.320
 They latch onto a big fish, like a 40 pound fish,

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.640
 they can drain it dry.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.720
 So a giant carp, they can drain dry

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.560
 by just latching on, sucking on,

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.600
 and then they drill their toothed tongue into the fish,

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.920
 probing like a boar hole.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:52.760
 - It's so gross.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.720
 - There's a horror movie from 2014 called

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.320
 Blood Lake, Attack of the Killer Lamprey's Brickhead,

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.080
 in which the mare gets eaten by a lamprey

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.160
 who comes up and bites him from his toilet.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.000
 - Awesome.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.840
 - Oh my.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:05.680
 - Toiler alert, sorry.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.240
 - They sound like the ocean Mongolian death worm, basically,

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.440
 and they look exactly like them.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.800
 - I think like pretty much all these horror film monsters

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.600
 that are long and with lots of teeth

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.160
 must be based on lampreys, right?

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.480
 - Yeah, so are we saying that the royals like lampreys

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.320
 because they contain the blood that they need?

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.560
 Is that why lamprey pie is such a treat for the royals?

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.400
 - It must be.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.240
 - 'Cause we've made them sound absolutely disgusting to eat,

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.320
 as in that these horrible blood tube alien things.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.920
 - Yeah, you'd want it hidden under the crust of a pie, I think.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:34.760
 (all laughing)

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:35.600
 - Yeah, it's not the most.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.960
 - The most disgusting blanket of anonymity of the pastry, yeah.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.400
 - Well, just while we're on fishy things that drink blood,

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.920
 you guys will have heard of the candiru, I'm sure.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.620
 These are the fish that don't swim up your penis.

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:49.460
 (all laughing)

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:50.800
 - Like all other fish.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.320
 (all laughing)

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.800
 - The one species.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.680
 - There are actually competitions to see what fish

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.760
 you can get up there.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.840
 Some people get sharks up their penises and they really brag.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.080
 - I had an orca up there.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.520
 (all laughing)

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.360
 - Awkward.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.800
 (all laughing)

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.080
 - So these, they're a kind of catfish.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.800
 - And the one thing they're famous for is the myth

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.920
 that they will swim up your penis and.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.800
 - Are you saying it's definitely a myth then?

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.680
 'Cause I know that the idea that they can swim up

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.400
 the stream of urine as you're urinating into the water

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.240
 is definitely a myth.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.280
 - That's what I thought was the myth, yeah.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.760
 - Well, so what the classic modus operandi is,

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.320
 they will infiltrate the slits of the gills

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.680
 of a larger catfish.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.280
 They'll grip onto the flesh inside,

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.600
 they'll break a blood vessel,

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.000
 they'll drink from the blood vessel

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.360
 and then they'll swim out of the gills again.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.560
 That's what they normally do.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.920
 So obviously, the idea is that, you know,

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.240
 they think a penis looks a bit like a fish's gill

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.800
 and they swim into it, they're drawn to it.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.400
 Fish urinate through their gills, so.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.240
 - There we go.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.400
 - We'll urinate through our penises.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.240
 - Exactly.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.060
 - Half of us.

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:54.400
 - It's so easy to see what the mistakes are.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.000
 - Better to be circumcised, I reckon,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.840
 if you're up against one of these guys.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.000
 I think it looks less gill-like, but continue.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.360
 (all laughing)

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.720
 - Okay, there's how it is.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:03.560
 - That's my opinion.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.400
 - There's how it is.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.600
 Health and cosmetic tip for the week.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.080
 - Tune in next week to find out what that shit thing is.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:10.920
 Say then.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:14.280
 - I'm not going to your fish, my goodness.

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.400
 - Is your penis too gill-like?

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.720
 Have you considered?

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.920
 (all laughing)

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:20.760
 Sorry, do go on.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.000
 - The point is that the candiru has only once

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.880
 swam up someone's urethra.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:25.720
 - That's enough.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.080
 - That's more than most fish.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.760
 (all laughing)

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:29.840
 - But then it died.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.440
 So it wasn't a, it died and was able to be,

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.280
 it was removed.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.560
 I imagine it was removed, actually.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.840
 - Why did it die?

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:36.680
 - I don't know why it died.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.760
 Are you saying it's just one individual curious fish

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.520
 that did this and the rest of his species

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.360
 would never do it?

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:43.760
 - Yeah, I think so.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:44.960
 Although actually this is only once

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:45.880
 in the medical literature.

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:46.720
 - Yeah.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.960
 - See, I imagine because if it swims into a catfish gill,

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.000
 it remains in water.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.480
 So it has water around it.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.000
 If it swam into someone's penis,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.440
 they probably jumped out of the water

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.440
 and then now it's out of its habitat, right?

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:57.280
 - Might well do.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.320
 That might well be the case.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.160
 - Yeah.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.280
 - Anyway, it's not something to worry about much.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.480
 (all laughing)

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.160
 - Did you guys know that Timothy Dalton went out

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.880
 with K.A.D.?

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:07.720
 - Really?

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.560
 - No.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.400
 - So K.A.D., the war correspondent.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.440
 - K.A.D., very famous British war correspondent,

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.840
 the ultimate war correspondent, really.

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.240
 They went out, they were in national youth theater together

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.080
 or so they were in a theater group together.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:18.920
 And--

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.720
 - Since when have we become Hello Magazine?

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:21.560
 (all laughing)

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.400
 - I quite like it.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.240
 - This is the weirdest section of Hello Magazine.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.200
 (all laughing)

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.520
 - I really want to start like a gossip magazine

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.680
 or podcast but about like really like obscure

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.000
 where people no one cares about

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.400
 like K.A.D.'s form of sex life.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:34.960
 She said of Timothy Dalton,

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.280
 he was a very shy young man

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.120
 but I even sewed up his tights for him

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.400
 while they were on.

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:40.240
 (all laughing)

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.080
 - Wow.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.240
 - You're saying it as if it's a very sexy thing.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.080
 - Guys.

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.920
 - I think sewing up someone's tights

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.720
 is actually the least sexual thing you can do.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:48.960
 - With a pair of tights at least.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:49.800
 - Yeah.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:50.640
 - Yeah.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.400
 - While they're on, I mean if you're sewing it up

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.600
 towards the crotch area.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.120
 - He didn't say that, I couldn't be in the toe.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.560
 - She could have stuck a pin through his cock.

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.440
 I mean, it might not be sexy at all.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.520
 - That can be sexy.

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.360
 - Yeah.

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.200
 - Oh God.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.040
 (all laughing)

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.200
 - It's K.A.D., it's sexy.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.040
 - Yeah.

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:04.880
 - No, it's not.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:05.700
 - Anyway, so that's some hot gauze.

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:06.540
 - That is hot gauze.

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:08.600
 - That's hot fresh, fresh from the mid 1980s.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.440
 - Yeah.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.800
 - One famous scientist in this kind of plant sentience area

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.840
 is Suzanne Simard.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.240
 We've spoken before about her work

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.280
 with mycorrhizal networks.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.520
 So the idea that you've got lots of trees

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.320
 and they have their roots

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.640
 and on the roots they have funguses

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:28.120
 and the fungus can kind of talk to each other

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.280
 and that means the trees can talk to each other

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.440
 and that means that if one tree is in trouble

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.280
 with something they can pass on the message

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.680
 to all the other trees, like an internet of plants.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:38.800
 - Get out of here.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:39.640
 I can't.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.360
 (all laughing)

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:45.400
 - But some of her more recent stuff is that she's worked out

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:50.320
 that kind of the patterns that these networks of trees create

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.260
 are very, very similar to the patterns

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.760
 in your neural network in your brain.

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.760
 And so the trees in like a forest

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.880
 is really, really similar to a human brain.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:09:59.720
 - What?

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.280
 - And not only that, some of the chemicals

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.520
 that they move between the roots are glutamates

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.000
 and glutamates are also the neurotransmitters

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.320
 that you use in your brain.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:11.080
 So it's almost like underneath the trees,

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.560
 there is something that's not just analogous to a brain

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.160
 but is also structured like a brain

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:16.960
 and uses the same chemicals as a brain.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.140
 - What we're saying is the planet,

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:21.760
 the trees are the brain of the world.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.560
 - No, the trees are like an upside down person

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.400
 with the brain at the bottom and the legs in the air.

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:29.320
 - The trees are the hair and under the skull, soil,

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:30.960
 is the brain.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:32.520
 - I prefer legs in the air.

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:33.800
 (all laughing)

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.420
 - It's more fun anyway.

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:37.600
 - Legs in the air is always more fun.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:38.840
 - So the trees are the--

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.060
 - Legs.

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:43.520
 - The trunks of the trees are the legs of the planet.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.960
 So the roots of the brain.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:46.800
 - Right?

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:47.640
 - Yeah.

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:48.960
 - You're really struggling with this.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:49.800
 Have you had a stroke?

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.300
 - I'm just gonna stretch it out to the whole world.

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:55.320
 So the trees, this network is the planet's brain effectively.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.160
 - Yes.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.300
 - I think that's what James was saying.

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:58.140
 - Sure.

00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:59.200
 (all laughing)

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.440
 - I think just next time you see a forest,

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.080
 think of it as a bunch of legs waving in the air

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.280
 and you'll enjoy your walk a bit more.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.400
 - And the genitals, I guess,

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.280
 'cause that's where you pollinate, right?

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:09.880
 So upside down with the balls in the air.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:10.720
 - Good point, yeah.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.080
 - Well, I'm gonna close my eyes the next time I see a tree.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.040
 (all laughing)

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:14.880
 - Peep brood.

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.760
 (all laughing)

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:20.160
 - Did you guys see the thing about the real life vampires?

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.080
 As in people who drink blood?

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.700
 - No.

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:24.880
 - I've seen a documentary on them.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.360
 They're mostly quite weird.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.720
 - Not professionally, I was about to say,

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.120
 but kind of as a compelled to do it.

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:30.960
 - As a hobby.

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.760
 - As a hobby, it is a hobby, yeah, yeah.

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:34.080
 You need to get lots of health certificates

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.400
 and things these days,

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.160
 from the people whose blood you're drinking,

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.880
 'cause you can get all sorts of diseases through blood.

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.040
 It's an incredibly unsafe thing to do, it's general.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:45.280
 - Yeah, I read an article about the Atlanta Vampire Alliance

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:48.080
 and they said that there are at least 5,000 people

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:52.120
 in the U.S. that identify as real vampires at the moment,

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:55.040
 but not all of them actually drink blood, apparently,

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.200
 'cause you're trying to get life force from someone,

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.240
 apparently some of them think that you can still

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.280
 be a vampire, but get the life force

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:02.980
 by giving someone a massage.

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:03.820
 - What?

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:04.660
 - What?

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:05.500
 - No.

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:06.320
 - Cheesy.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.880
 - That's what they say.

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.920
 You're collecting the psychic energy of someone,

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.440
 but instead of taking it through the blood,

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.840
 'cause that's a bit icky,

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.560
 you can do it through a nice little massage.

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.200
 - I think you've got, there's gotta be some ingested

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.240
 of some part of that.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.860
 You could maybe eat their dandruff.

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:20.920
 (laughing)

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:22.680
 A friendly veggie vampire.

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:23.520
 - Yeah?

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:24.340
 - Yeah.

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:25.180
 - What do they do then?

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:26.360
 Do they sleep in coffins?

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:27.840
 Do they sleep in the day?

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:28.680
 Do they--

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.080
 - They meet online and talkbots,

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.720
 and then occasionally have in-person meetings

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.520
 where they talk about.

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:36.360
 Talk about.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.200
 - Massaging each other.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.040
 - Massaging each other.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.640
 - It's mostly drinking blood based, though, isn't it?

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.520
 Rather than, they don't do the garlic thing or the--

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:43.920
 - They can be seen in mirrors.

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:46.080
 (laughing)

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:46.920
 - They're not dead.

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:47.960
 - Not destroyed in light.

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:48.780
 - Yeah.

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:50.640
 - Cape sails have not rocketed.

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:51.560
 - Right.

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:53.840
 But those party teeth.

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.640
 - They've all bought them, yeah.

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.520
 - Those are apparently not good to drink blood with.

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:58.920
 Vampire bats don't have those.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:02.040
 Their sharp teeth are right at the front.

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:03.040
 They do have some sharpened teeth,

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.240
 but they're right at the front,

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:06.960
 and they just scratch until there's blood exposed,

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.800
 and then they lap it up.

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:09.960
 - Oh, okay.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:11.240
 - Yeah, cute, really.

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.600
 - And they're more likely to bite you

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.320
 on your big toe, aren't they?

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.240
 - Oh, you're right.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:17.880
 - They tend to not fly onto you, bats,

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.760
 and then eat you from your neck.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.240
 They tend to land a fair distance away from you.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:23.240
 You might be lying down,

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.080
 sunbathing or sleeping or something,

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:27.280
 and then they walk up to you on the ground,

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:30.000
 and then they just kind of grab any exposed little bit,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.600
 which might be your fertile, your big toe.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.440
 - You can see why Bram Stoker sexed it up a bit.

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.640
 Rather than just saying Dracula's sucking away on your toes.

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:38.480
 I don't know, yeah.

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.760
 - The fetishist out there, like a hood.

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:42.560
 - I didn't know (beep) was a vampire.

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:44.560
 (all laughing)

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.720
 - There's the lawsuit bell, ding-a-ling.

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:51.320
 - I can hear the lawyers making money, money, money.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:54.000
 - One good time to be selfish is if you have a partner

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.520
 who's very altruistic.

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:59.480
 So it's, you don't want two altruistic people

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:01.800
 in a relationship or two selfish people,

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.820
 but it is useful to have one selfish person

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:08.660
 and one altruistic person in the specific time

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:10.840
 that you're trying to work out what movie to watch

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.600
 or what restaurant to go to or something like that.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:14.600
 - Who should have the last chip?

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:15.900
 - Who should have the last chip?

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:18.480
 Because otherwise, if both of you are too altruistic,

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.440
 you end up, neither of you have any chips.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.360
 If you're both greedy, you end up fighting.

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.240
 (all laughing)

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.600
 So this was a study, I mean, it's quite, you know,

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:27.760
 obvious that that would happen,

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.760
 but there was a study that proved it.

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:33.200
 They got people to watch a load of clips of different shows,

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.240
 like for instance, clips of Saturday Night Live,

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.240
 some that are funny, some that are more interesting,

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.640
 some that are more, you know, like horror films and stuff.

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:43.040
 And they rated how much they liked each one.

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:46.480
 And they also did surveys to measure how selfish they were.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:49.560
 And then a few weeks later, they were divided into pairs.

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:51.800
 And when you got two selfish people together

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.760
 or two altruistic people together,

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.800
 it turned out that whatever they chose to watch

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.640
 was something that neither of them liked.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:58.960
 When they looked at their old survey,

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:00.880
 they found that actually neither of you liked this,

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:03.040
 but you ended up watching something kind of,

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:05.320
 you compromised to something that neither of you liked.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.120
 - God, I've been in that situation so many times.

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.200
 Have you not all done that?

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.520
 (all laughing)

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:10.360
 - Yeah, exactly, yeah.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.120
 - No, I think I'm the selfish one.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.200
 - Oh my God, you're always in there

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.560
 watching something you love and you're poor white,

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.040
 grinding away for another Arnold Schwarzenegger.

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:21.000
 - It's just the Tom Cruise mission impossible marathons.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.760
 - Back to back, yeah.

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.840
 - Can we at least watch a different mission impossible?

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.180
 - No.

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:28.040
 Six is the best.

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.380
 - Yep.

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:31.520
 - Can we split the chip in half, Andy?

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:32.680
 (all laughing)

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:34.880
 - It's already disappearing down my throat.

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:39.120
 Have you guys heard of Sabbath mode?

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:39.960
 - No.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:40.800
 - This is cool.

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:44.320
 Lots of dishwashers are Sabbath mode.

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:47.920
 And it's because there's this big argument in Judaism

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:52.280
 about electricity on the Sabbath Shabbat.

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:53.400
 If you turn on a light,

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:56.400
 are you technically igniting a fire band?

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:59.640
 Or are you theoretically cooking something also banned?

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:01.080
 Or are you completing a product?

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:03.440
 The product is incandescent light, also banned.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.480
 So this is a big problem.

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:08.200
 And in 1998, Whirlpool's KitchenAid line of products,

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.000
 they introduced Sabbath mode.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.200
 And it's basically just, I mean, it's just timers, isn't it?

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.800
 - But they did that with a lot of products in America.

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.280
 And they do things like with,

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:20.500
 if you, 'cause America and New York, let's say,

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.880
 there's a lot of high-rise buildings

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:24.240
 and a lot of people living in flats.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:27.440
 So if you have an elderly Jewish family

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.680
 that are living on the fifth floor,

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.200
 how do they get up if they can't press

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:32.200
 the elevator button to take them up?

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.640
 So on Sabbath, the elevators are designed

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.480
 so that they just stop at every floor on that day.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.800
 And it means that you can get in there without touching it.

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.280
 But I like the Sabbath Goy,

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.760
 which is what I guess all of us would be,

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:46.340
 which is if you have friends who are Jewish

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:48.680
 and they are very strict on Sabbath day

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:49.960
 and they can't touch things,

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.960
 they're not explicitly allowed to ask

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.920
 for you to do something on their behalf.

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.720
 But they can kind of subtly suggest it like,

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:56.560
 "Oh, I want to be greater."

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:57.680
 - There's a bloody dark in here.

00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.240
 (all laughing)

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:00.080
 - I think not one or two,

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:02.200
 'cause I used to live up in Tottenham

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.800
 and I never did 'cause I was usually at work,

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.400
 but my housemate used to sometimes be asked

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.680
 to go around to our neighbor's house

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:08.920
 to switch stuff on for them,

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:11.240
 which I didn't realize we could have been like,

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:13.720
 "Actually, pal, you're breaking your own laws there,"

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:14.560
 by asking.

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:15.920
 - How strictly you take care of it.

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:16.760
 - There's so much to it.

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:17.600
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:18.640
 - They're obviously taking it quite strictly enough

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.480
 not to do it themselves, but not quite.

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:21.440
 That's where they've drawn the line.

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.600
 - Everyone draws the line somewhere, don't they?

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:24.440
 - But did they explicitly,

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:26.080
 do we know the language that was used?

00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:26.920
 - I don't actually know.

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:27.760
 Maybe it was a hint.

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:28.600
 - Yeah.

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:29.600
 - I'm gonna have to draw that.

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.280
 Well, someone's gonna have to draw me a line.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.040
 (all laughing)

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:36.400
 - So, here's a cool thing about the first film,

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.460
 the first avatar.

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:39.260
 It was filmed on this massive great set.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:40.680
 It was like a hanger

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:43.400
 and it was called The Volume, this huge space, right?

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:46.600
 And it was where another great project

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:47.600
 had been put together.

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.080
 - Can we guess?

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.680
 - Massive hanger in California.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:54.480
 - It was where they made the space shuttle.

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:55.320
 - Oh, you're so close.

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.120
 It's aeronautics.

00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.920
 - It's where the Wright brothers made the first plane.

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:00.760
 - It's in between those two.

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:01.600
 - Concorde?

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:02.440
 - Oh, good.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:04.040
 - Have you heard of The Spruce Goose?

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:04.880
 - Oh, yeah.

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:05.720
 - How are you?

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:10.080
 - The largest plane in the world was made in the hanger

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:12.120
 where the largest movie in the world

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:13.960
 went on to be made, yeah.

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.160
 - Wasn't it The Largest Seaplane?

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.480
 Is it The Largest plane in the world?

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:17.480
 - It was humongous, wasn't it?

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:18.680
 And it's made out of wood.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.760
 - It was made in almost entirely out of wood.

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.720
 And I think at the time it was the largest plane,

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:25.200
 as in the Boeing 747 was bigger,

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.440
 but that was 30 years before the 747.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.200
 90% birch and then some rice paper

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:30.920
 and some aluminum paint over the top of it.

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:31.760
 And it was also--

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.120
 - It was rice paper?

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:35.440
 - Yeah, rice paper was involved in the construction.

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.560
 - And the passengers also had eating the plane.

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:39.800
 (all laughing)

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:41.720
 - And it was 1942, you started making it.

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.360
 And it was, or he'd been working on it for years.

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.800
 And he spent, how would he use this as the,

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:47.120
 again, eccentric.

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.440
 - Very eccentric.

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:51.240
 Used to measure his carrots before he ate them and stuff.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:54.640
 - Yeah, he used to keep bottles of whee with him.

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:55.880
 - Yeah, he had a sad decline.

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:58.240
 He became very isolated and obsessive.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.080
 And you know, had a--

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:00.720
 - Well, this was part of it, I think, wasn't it?

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:02.840
 - Well, it was the sort of grand project

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.960
 that might have pushed him quite far.

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:06.680
 - And played by Leonardo DiCaprio in a movie

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:09.760
 who also play the aviator.

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:12.440
 But isn't that weird that the aviator,

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.480
 what does that almost exactly the same as?

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:15.600
 - Avatar.

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:18.520
 - It's the Avatar aviator.

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:21.200
 - It was the West Country Avatar, wasn't it?

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:23.080
 (all laughing)

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:26.120
 - And it cost about $300 million in modern money,

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:27.920
 slightly more than the film Avatar.

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:28.760
 Isn't that weird?

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:29.600
 - More than that.

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:32.400
 - Yeah, yeah, and the wings were 11 feet deep.

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.640
 You could walk comfortably inside the wings.

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.400
 Guess how long it flew for in total?

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.920
 Total aggregate time?

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:39.480
 - I thought it only flew once.

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:40.920
 - Well, maybe it flew a few times,

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:43.760
 but yeah, maybe a couple of hours.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:44.600
 - 30 seconds.

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:45.440
 - 30 seconds, absolutely.

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:46.280
 - 30 seconds.

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:47.120
 - It had one test flight where--

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.640
 - We'd travel us on board, right?

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:49.920
 - Well, it was a test flight

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:51.760
 just seeing if it could handle moving around,

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.880
 basically, on the water, and then it did take off.

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:55.000
 And there was always a question over

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.240
 whether Howard Hughes had actually planned that all along

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:00.600
 and flew once in 1947 for half a minute, and that was it.

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:03.440
 - So weird, we got a tweet, actually, last night, I think,

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:05.920
 just before, as we were researching this show,

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:08.960
 from a guy called Chris Nobel, who follows us on Twitter,

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:10.880
 who was pointing us to a thread, did you see it?

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:12.760
 A thread on Twitter of loads of interesting facts

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:13.600
 about punctuation.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.520
 It was by someone called @CulturalTutor,

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:19.200
 and some of my favorite things were,

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.760
 well, I really didn't know how old the @ symbol was,

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:23.520
 and I don't think we've mentioned that before.

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:27.440
 - I think it's an old shipping thing.

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:28.760
 - I thought it was an accountancy thing.

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:32.440
 So it's like five bushels at one pound each.

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.760
 - You actually could both be right,

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:35.840
 'cause it served lots of purposes over the years

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:36.920
 from medieval times.

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:40.280
 So it was used in medieval Bulgaria for the A in Amen.

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:42.520
 If you couldn't be asked to write Amen at the end of a prayer,

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:43.920
 you just do the @ symbol.

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:48.480
 Yep, it was an abbreviation for a weight in Spain,

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:53.000
 and it was, by the 17th century, actually, in France,

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.440
 it was being used as short for @.

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:57.000
 So that symbol all the way around.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:57.840
 Isn't that so weird?

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:01.120
 Yeah, I do see that in lots of old medieval texts, yes.

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:02.720
 - It feels like if you're doing a prayer,

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.600
 you shouldn't be just taking shortcuts all the time.

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:06.440
 - I don't know why.

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:09.040
 You've struggled all the way to the end.

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:10.840
 The power and the glory, blah, blah, blah.

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:12.320
 Let's get out of the church.

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:13.800
 - Was that the only one?

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:14.920
 - No, so other good stuff.

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:17.880
 I liked the oldest punctuation mark in history

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:19.960
 that stayed unchanged as the asterisk.

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:21.280
 - Oh, okay.

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.720
 - I think it's been quite modern.

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.920
 But yeah, it was used to correct a piece of Homer

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:26.160
 in the second century BC.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.800
 - So was it used as a footnote,

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:29.160
 as in that's where the correction

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.160
 would appear underneath?

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.520
 Wow, that's cool. - Yeah, in the same way,

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:32.680
 I believe, yeah. - That's good.

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:34.600
 - And I also didn't know that.

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.560
 I mean, this is really too nerdy

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:38.520
 and no one's gonna care except weird pettance.

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:40.080
 But you know the possessive apostrophe--

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:42.400
 - And presumably there's a person who tweeted it.

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.360
 - And me, so at least I'm with the same.

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.200
 - Probably our entire listenership, I would think.

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.360
 - Exactly.

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:48.960
 You all know it's a compliment.

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.600
 The possessive apostrophe is actually--

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:52.080
 - Come out, come out, come out.

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.200
 (laughing)

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:57.680
 - The possessive apostrophe is actually exactly the same

00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:59.840
 as the apostrophe that denotes a missing letter.

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:02.280
 So you know if you say it's with an apostrophe,

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:03.880
 to mean it is, 'cause you're denoting

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:05.360
 that the I is missing. - Yeah, right.

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:09.440
 - Actually, the possessive one, as in Andy's jumper,

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:13.360
 it used to be that you'd write a possessive as ES.

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:16.160
 And so it would be A-N-D-Y-E-S, jumper.

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.120
 - Andy's jumper. - Yeah.

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:20.120
 And then they just, you started using the,

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:22.840
 or we've missed out the E here.

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:24.760
 And so it's the same, look, it's the same thing.

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:26.920
 - It's like a genitive ending in other languages.

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:28.440
 - It's a genitive ending, yeah.

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:29.840
 - Interesting.

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:31.320
 - So that is interesting for a few--

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:33.640
 - That's a nice funny bit to end the section on.

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:35.800
 (humming)

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:38.560
 (laughing)

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:40.440
 - Would you rather have a general anaesthetic

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:42.520
 or watch an episode of Only Fools and Horses?

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:43.360
 (laughing)

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:44.640
 - Definitely the anaesthetic.

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:45.840
 (laughing)

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:46.680
 - Which episode is it?

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:47.760
 The one where Delboy falls through the bars?

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:48.600
 - Yeah, of course.

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:49.440
 - I can watch that.

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:51.760
 (laughing)

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:54.280
 - This was a thing that was tried in the year 2010.

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:55.400
 It was--

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:56.240
 - Did they really?

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:57.080
 - Yeah. - Well, they tried

00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:59.080
 to knock you out by watching Only Fools and Horses.

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:00.800
 - Well, they, so it was a study

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:02.880
 on what makes people need less anaesthesia

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:06.880
 and watching DVDs seemed to genuinely help

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:09.880
 and mean people could get by with a local anaesthetic

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.320
 rather than a general.

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:12.800
 So you'd normally need to be knocked out

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:15.160
 for these procedures, but people were,

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:17.920
 it was a doctor called Nick Pace who,

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:19.560
 and he just brought in his own DVDs from home.

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.560
 So we also had Blue Planet and Mamma Mia

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:22.880
 and other things and some of them.

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.200
 - But it looked a taste, Nick.

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:25.040
 Nice.

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:25.880
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:28.440
 He contains multitudes and basically it works

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:31.240
 and distraction through whatever means

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:33.080
 means you need less anaesthesia.

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.240
 And there's been a recent study

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:37.120
 which had VR headsets and also meant

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.000
 that people need way less anaesthesia

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.720
 'cause they just put you on a calm mountain top.

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:41.560
 - At all, yeah.

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:43.040
 - Oh, they don't put you inside Pecker.

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:45.240
 (laughing)

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:46.080
 - All right, Dave.

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:49.360
 - You are Triggers Broome and you're moving along.

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:50.440
 - You did that with Billy Conley,

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.320
 playing Billy Conley to patients, didn't they?

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:53.160
 - Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.440
 - They medically proved that Billy Conley

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:55.800
 makes you feel less pain.

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:57.720
 And I think what they did was they made them put their hands

00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.280
 in like a cold ice bucket or something

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:00.120
 and they felt it less

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:02.360
 when they had Billy's comedy being played to them.

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:03.600
 - Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.840
 - But Nick Pace said that some patients were disappointed

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:07.120
 because the operation ended

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.600
 before they got to the end of their DVD

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:10.920
 of "Opening Fools and Horses."

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:11.760
 - Really?

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:14.520
 (laughing)

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:17.080
 - I've just one more thing on the Imara people

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:19.720
 who are indigenous Bolivians, which is really cool.

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:20.720
 So they're really well-known,

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:23.120
 the women for their really amazing knitting skills,

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.080
 hundreds of years.

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.040
 They've been hand knitting really intricate stuff.

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:28.680
 And there was this great story,

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:30.080
 I think it was about 10 years ago

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:32.240
 where doctors have been trying to solve this problem

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:35.680
 in Bolivia for ages of there being 10 times as many babies

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:38.680
 as is the norm born with holes in their hearts.

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:40.600
 And it's 'cause of the high altitude.

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:42.880
 So something happens in utero.

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:46.120
 And it's a problem you often need to operate on them.

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:48.480
 And a doctor designed these,

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:51.040
 like they look like actually mini top hats,

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:54.120
 which you put up somebody in a catheter

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.440
 and it travels up to the heart

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:56.840
 and it blocks up the hole.

00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:58.320
 - It travels up to the heart.

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:01.040
 - I know, it's kind of amazing.

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:04.640
 Anyway, it's made with tiny intricate bits of wire

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.120
 and it has to be knitted.

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:08.400
 And it's too intricate for a machine to do it.

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:11.040
 And so this guy thought, "Hey, who's really good at knitting?"

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:13.360
 And he called up the Imara women and said,

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:16.600
 "Can you start knitting really, really tiny wire hats

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:19.080
 "to put in baby's hearts to block their holes up?"

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:19.920
 And they did.

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:21.440
 So this is what they do now.

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:24.440
 No more woolly hats for the Imara kids, but...

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:25.560
 - That is pretty amazing.

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:26.640
 - But warm hearts.

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:27.480
 - But warm.

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.600
 - Oh, God.

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:31.760
 - Really warm heart, that story.

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:32.920
 - That is gross.

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:35.600
 (laughing)

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:37.080
 - Well, I've just got one more thing about

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:41.080
 on the subject of gruesome animal trophies being worn.

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:41.920
 - Oh yeah.

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:44.160
 - This is actually, it's not a thing being worn,

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:45.360
 but it is a Bolivian thing.

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:49.600
 There's a big tradition in Bolivia of llama fetuses.

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:51.840
 This is a huge, huge deal.

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:52.680
 Yeah, yeah.

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:53.640
 - Of wearing them?

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:55.040
 - Not wearing them, no, that's the thing,

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:56.440
 but they are incredibly lucky.

00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:59.200
 So they're sold in so-called witch's markets.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.040
 - Yeah, really?

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:01.040
 - I think they're called sulus,

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:02.200
 I'm probably pronouncing that wrong,

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:03.680
 but they, and you know,

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:04.960
 there are all stages of development.

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:06.200
 They can be very, very tiny,

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:09.480
 or they can be kind of miniature llamas, basically,

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:10.640
 with wool on them.

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.320
 And if you know what's good for you,

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:14.720
 you'll bury one in the foundations of your house.

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.040
 - Right, really?

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:18.840
 - Very lucky, very auspicious property, yeah.

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:21.200
 - Oh, God, 'cause you wouldn't think at looking at a llama.

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:23.840
 I've never seen a llama fetus, but I don't imagine it looks like it.

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:26.840
 - They're not very, they're not as cute as llamas.

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:28.560
 - No, no, no.

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:29.960
 - But it's the first question you'll ask

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:32.080
 in a state agent in Bolivia is-

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:32.920
 - On right move.

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:33.760
 - Absolutely.

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:34.600
 - Can you filter by that?

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:35.600
 - There's a special box.

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:38.760
 (all laughing)

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:42.960
 - llama fetus check, two bathrooms check, yeah.

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:45.040
 - You guys come across Peter Hicks.

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:45.880
 - Peter Hicks, no.

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:48.720
 - He was really famous in 1963,

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:51.960
 because he kept getting annoyed with parking tickets

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:53.520
 that he was getting in his van.

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:55.600
 And so he parked it up in Short's Gardens,

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:57.320
 which is just up the road from here.

00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:59.280
 And he put on a device,

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:01.880
 which electrocuted traffic wardens in it.

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.200
 - Oh, wow.

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:04.040
 - Yeah.

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:07.280
 And he just, he became this massive core celebrity

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:11.120
 that if ever a traffic warden went to give him a ticket,

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:12.720
 they would get electrocuted.

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:15.000
 And I saw an interview with his son,

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.320
 and he said he used to deliberately drive around

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:22.400
 and park in a place where he knew he would get a ticket.

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:24.520
 And it would always be somewhere outside a pub.

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:27.520
 And then him and his mates would sit in the pub watching

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:29.680
 and waiting for a traffic warden to come along.

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.800
 - Presumably a pile of dead traffic warden

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:33.680
 be filled by the car.

00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:35.400
 - He said that it's harmless,

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:37.920
 apart from a bit of a flash in a nasty jog.

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:41.280
 - You have fallen into your own pedantic trap

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:44.120
 that you always lay between electrocuted and electrified

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:46.600
 and implied that he was just murdering traffic wardens.

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:48.000
 - That's true, yeah, that's true.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.640
 They were electrified.

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:50.840
 But he told the press,

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:53.280
 until someone tells me what law I'm breaking,

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:55.520
 I shall keep up my private war.

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:57.080
 And of course, they soon told him

00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:58.840
 exactly what law he was breaking.

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:01.960
 I didn't know how much they were worth,

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:05.520
 'cause snail slime is useful for beauty and stuff, right?

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:06.880
 I think we might have mentioned it before,

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:10.600
 but you can farm snails and you can extract the slime

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:12.080
 and people put it on their faces

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:14.200
 and they think it makes them look younger.

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:16.600
 But the global snail beauty market

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:19.840
 is worth $340 million,

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:22.280
 which is about the same as Zoom is worth.

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:23.640
 - Wow. - Wow.

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.280
 - Yeah, so you could,

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:27.680
 if you're the guy who owns or girl who owns Zoom,

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:29.160
 I don't know who owns Zoom,

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:33.000
 you could sell it and buy all of the snail beauty products

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.240
 in the entire world.

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:36.480
 - And would you recommend that as a business choice?

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:38.840
 - It's just a would you rather, really, isn't it?

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:39.680
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:40.840
 - You'll have $340 million,

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:44.040
 but there's gonna be a snail chasing you,

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:45.680
 trying to make you look younger forever.

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:46.520
 - Trying to claim the money,

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:47.880
 'cause guys, do you know how much the snail see

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:49.520
 of that money?

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:50.440
 - Yeah, none.

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:51.280
 - It's nothing.

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:53.120
 - It's nothing, it's not expensive,

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.120
 but they must get sort of living,

00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:55.120
 they must get treated quite well

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:56.200
 compared with snails and the water.

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:57.120
 - A nice lettuce leaf.

00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:59.680
 - Yeah, well, that's one of the big things,

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:01.240
 'cause it used to be to extract the mucus,

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.520
 you needed to basically force the snail

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:05.080
 in order to produce it

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:07.440
 and you would do things like throw vinegar on a snail

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:08.960
 and that would make it in distress,

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:10.080
 kind of produce the mucus.

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.240
 Not really nice and it always dies afterwards.

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:14.840
 And so there's a place, it's in Italy,

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:16.960
 called the International Snail Breeding Institute,

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:20.320
 and there's a guy there who has basically come up

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:23.000
 with the concept of how you could treat them effectively

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.480
 to a day spa and get better fluids out of them.

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:30.600
 So here's the thing, happy snails produce better mucus.

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:32.680
 They produce it and it's more, it's richer,

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:35.320
 it's basically they're happy to give it out,

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:37.560
 whereas in the petrified vinegary version,

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:39.080
 they're like, well, and it just, it's not good.

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:41.040
 - I imagine it's equally useful

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:43.160
 for making you look younger, though.

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:44.000
 - Yeah.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:44.840
 - Do you think it doesn't make you look younger?

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:46.280
 - I shouldn't have thought so.

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:47.200
 - You think it does?

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.720
 - I just think it does, but I've no evidence for it.

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:49.560
 - That explains why you've got

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:51.120
 10 snails on your face right now.

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:52.720
 (laughing)

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.560
 I don't think any of those things work, do they?

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:55.400
 - I don't know.

00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:57.680
 - It seems unlikely.

00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:59.120
 - As you say, it's a big industry

00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:02.440
 and one thing, if you do use snail mucus on your face,

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:03.520
 if you're listening right now,

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:04.640
 make sure that whatever you buy

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:07.960
 doesn't say extract of snail slime slash mucus

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:10.760
 because it's effectively a watered down version.

00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:14.840
 It's like, let's imagine ribena in like ribena

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:16.160
 in the ribena with water.

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:17.000
 - It's squash.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:17.840
 - It's a snail squash.

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:18.680
 - It's a snail squash.

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:20.520
 - But given that neither is remotely effective,

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:21.840
 then you might as well get the cheaper one.

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:24.280
 - Why are we all alienating future advertisers like this?

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:25.600
 What are we doing?

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:29.000
 - You can get dried powder made from the snail slime.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.800
 I don't know how useful that is,

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:33.120
 but it sells for $58,000 per kilo,

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:36.200
 which is 75 times more expensive than silver.

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:37.040
 - What?

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:37.880
 And what's that for?

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:39.040
 Is that for the skin as well?

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:40.360
 - That's for the skin as well.

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:42.600
 Most of the article says it costs more than gold,

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:46.280
 but gold has just overtaken it quite recently.

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:47.640
 - That'd be good to smuggle

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:49.560
 'cause no one would think to look for it.

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:52.440
 Like the cocaine dog would come by and you'd be fine

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:53.280
 because it's not cocaine.

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:54.760
 - The cocaine snail, though.

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:56.680
 (all laughing)

00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:58.600
 - The trial of those didn't work as well,

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:00.040
 did it in airports.

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:00.880
 (all laughing)

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:02.240
 - It was three days later.

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:03.080
 - Hey.

00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:05.760
 (all laughing)

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:07.160
 - I lost in a pub quiz recently

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:10.160
 to a group called the Big Titty Committee.

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.160
 (all laughing)

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:13.000
 Oh my God.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.240
 - It's pretty sad, isn't it?

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:16.080
 - That is, yeah.

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:17.080
 - It's a bad time.

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:18.520
 - It's quite a good tactic in a pub quiz though,

00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:20.840
 to stand up with a really stupid name.

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:23.200
 But actually you've been reading the Encyclopedia all day.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.480
 Whatever it is you do in a pub quiz, you know.

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:26.920
 I would love it if every movie had

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:28.200
 what happened to all these characters after the film.

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:29.040
 - Would you?

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:30.640
 Because my wife hates them.

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:31.480
 - Oh, really?

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:33.600
 - She really, like, properly, as in,

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.520
 you know, there's a few things in your life,

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:36.920
 we do quite a lot of things, haven't we,

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:39.480
 that really, really, really gets you,

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:41.960
 even though most people don't care about them.

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:43.120
 - Well, I don't know what you mean,

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:45.920
 I'm a very relaxed guy, I'm not easily irritated.

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:48.400
 - Well, with Polina, it's these things at the end,

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:51.000
 and she reckons that if you're a storyteller,

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.360
 you shouldn't need them.

00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:55.000
 Like, the story should go from the start to the finish,

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.240
 and you shouldn't have to add extra little bits at the end

00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:59.560
 to say, oh, by the way, here's a bit we didn't fit in

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:01.520
 that you need to know in order for the rest of the story

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:02.360
 to make sense.

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:03.720
 - And it's always, you would only ever see that,

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:05.640
 or I've only ever seen that in non-fiction stuff,

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:07.000
 like film documentaries, right,

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000
 where it's like this person was released from prison

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.280
 and lived happily ever after.

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:11.960
 - I'm saying I want it in all films.

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:13.560
 I want, at the end of Die Hard, I want to see,

00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:16.840
 John McClane went on to be in three more terrorist incidents

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:18.200
 (laughing)

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:20.400
 with steadily decreasing dramatic effects.

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:22.800
 (laughing)

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:25.000
 - But then I agree with that kind of, with that,

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.560
 because you then lose, I remember seeing years ago,

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:30.920
 there was a young Indiana Jones TV series,

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:34.920
 and you see Indiana Jones as a very old man telling a story.

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:36.520
 And I thought, well, okay, shit,

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:38.400
 now I know he dies as a very old man.

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:41.160
 I would rather not know where Indiana Jones met his ending.

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:42.840
 And I know we have movies coming out now,

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:44.280
 the latest one's coming out.

00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:46.280
 - 'Cause like, for instance, when you went to the cinema

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:47.800
 and that big boulder was chasing him,

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:49.280
 you're like, he's gonna get away.

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:50.240
 (laughing)

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:51.720
 I've seen him.

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:55.360
 - Barge Haulers was a job, and they used to be naked.

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:56.440
 - Barge Haulers, was that?

00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:57.280
 - Oh, yes.

00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:58.240
 - Was it when you're like on the bank of the canal,

00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.200
 like tugging along at the river?

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.520
 - Tugging the barge, yeah.

00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:02.080
 This was, I was reading about barge Haulers,

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:03.920
 which was a job in lots of countries.

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:08.920
 And in China on the Yangtze, then they would, what?

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:11.200
 - Yangtze, like, it sounds like Yangtze,

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:13.960
 you're tugging someone on the Yangtze, you're naked.

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:16.200
 - That's where it comes from, yeah.

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:19.840
 But Yangtze didn't have a bridge until 1957.

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:22.560
 And motor transport, not that common around,

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:26.240
 especially like upper reaches of a 3000 kilometer long Yangtze.

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:28.360
 And so the Haulers would haul your boat for you,

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:29.360
 and they'd be naked.

00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:31.320
 'Cause wearing clothes hurt your skin.

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:32.160
 - Oh, yeah.

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:33.840
 (laughing)

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:35.720
 - Not the act of hauling a massive boat up a river.

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:36.560
 No, no, no.

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:38.400
 - No, no, it's the bloody gloves.

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:40.440
 (laughing)

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:41.600
 - Oh, the chaffing.

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:45.520
 - They just wanted to feel that soft rope on their skin.

00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:47.840
 I think also they ended up in the water hell of a lot.

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:49.520
 So you don't get in the water too close.

00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:50.720
 - Oh, yeah, but they did, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:52.520
 Oh, I've fallen in them all wet.

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:54.440
 (laughing)

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.160
 - I've been breaking Chinese accent, you done?

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:58.400
 (laughing)

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:01.480
 - Okay, that's it for this week's episode.

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:04.040
 I hope you enjoyed hearing Anna's voice again,

00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:08.160
 and I hope you enjoyed the general riffs.

00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:11.000
 As I said at the top, we are gonna be doing live shows.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.240
 Unfortunately, not with Anna, 'cause she will be away still,

00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:16.800
 but we do have some extraordinarily exciting guests

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:19.200

00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:22.000
 and of course for our one-off show at King's Place.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.680

 Okay, we will see you another time,

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:06.120
 another place with another bonus bit of secret content,

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:08.840
 and until then, we'll catch you on a regular show.

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:09.680
 Bye.

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:12.260
 (upbeat music)

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:14.840
 (upbeat music)
