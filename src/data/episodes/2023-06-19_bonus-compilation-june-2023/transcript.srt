1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,440
 - Hey, Club Fishers, Dan here.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,020
 Welcome to your secret bonus bit of content.

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,680
 We have a compilation for you this week,

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,520
 which is quite exciting,

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,120
 'cause we haven't done a compilation in ages.

7
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,280
 And actually, as a result of not having done it

8
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,560
 for such a long time, there's a huge backlog.

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,920
 We have so much unused archive.

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,160
 And what you're gonna get today is a special one

11
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,680
 because it's gonna be populated entirely

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,520
 in every single clip with an old friend of the show,

13
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,440
 very familiar voice,

14
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,280
 but I think you're gonna be quite excited to hear again.

15
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,200
 She's a good one.

16
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,580
 So I hope you enjoy it.

17
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,920
 And also just wanna quickly say thank you

18
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,200
 to everyone who's bought tickets to come see us

19
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,120
 at the Soho Theater for both July and August.

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,440
 We're doing 11 shows each night with a new special guest.

21
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,560
 And they're basically sold out every single show.

22
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,680
 There's only a few tickets remaining.

23
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,100
 And if you want to try and come to one of those,

24
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,920
 then please head to knowsuchthingasafish.com/live.

25
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,400
 And you'll find the link there to the Soho Theater

26
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,120
 and you'll be able to get the tickets.

27
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,880
 However, if you can't make that,

28
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,040
 but you're thinking, "But I am in London in September."

29
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:10,880
 Well, good news.

30
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,080
 We're very excited to announce

31
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,400
 that we are gonna be once again

32
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,200
 playing the London Podcast Festival.

33
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,680
 This happens at King's Place.

34
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,200
 It's such a fun event

35
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,800
 because all the British podcasts get to come together

36
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,120
 and do their live shows.

37
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,680
 And we get to be one of them.

38
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,500
 And if you wanna come see that,

39
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,140
 we're gonna be doing that on the 14th of September

40
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,780
 at 7 p.m.

41
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,580
 So all you need to do is go to

42
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,340
 knowsuchthingasafish.com/podfest

43
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,900
 and you'll be able to get tickets there.

44
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,020
 I would do that ASAP

45
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,420
 because we haven't announced this anywhere else yet.

46
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,620
 It's gonna be announced on the main show on Friday.

47
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,180
 So you've got a few days to get in there early

48
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,940
 and snap up all the tickets.

49
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,780
 If you're thinking, "God damn it, another London show.

50
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,700
 When am I gonna be able to see fish outside of there?"

51
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,020
 We're very sorry.

52
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,840
 This is just how it has to be for the moment,

53
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,440
 except for the fact to say

54
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,880
 that this show is gonna be streamed online.

55
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,920
 So you could be anywhere,

56
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,280
 anywhere in the world and watch it.

57
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,280
 So all you need to do is head to that link,

58
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,160
 knowsuchthingasafish.com/podfest

59
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,960
 and you will be able to buy

60
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,220
 an option for online streaming.

61
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,680
 So go and do that.

62
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,400
 Buy tickets to the live show itself.

63
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,920
 If you do happen to be in London,

64
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,840
 we love doing these London Podcast Fest shows.

65
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,000
 They're really, really funny.

66
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,920
 They're full of facts,

67
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:24,500
 dorkery, bad puns and more, as it says in the briefing.

68
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,860
 And hopefully we'll see some of you there.

69
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,300
 Otherwise, please enjoy this bonus bit of content

70
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,100
 with our good mate, Anna Tyshinski.

71
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,180
 - I was talking to someone about

72
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,820
 a blood transfusion the other day

73
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,780
 and she was saying that afterwards,

74
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,860
 the energy, this kind of revitalize,

75
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,500
 she was like, "I felt like I was 20 again."

76
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,100
 I was just like, "I wonder if it gives the--"

77
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:46,940
 - Was it the queen?

78
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:47,780
 - Yeah. - You were talking too.

79
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,580
 (laughing)

80
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,120
 - And she has lizard blood, which is extremely,

81
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,160
 yeah, you'd really get a kick off that.

82
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:59,240
 - Another animal that drinks blood is the lamprey, the fish.

83
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,080
 Supposedly the most bloodthirsty of all the fish,

84
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,880
 according to a Michigan newspaper in 1955.

85
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,380
 - That's a very honest of you to say.

86
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:14,240
 - Well, I thought it was quite a strong claim.

87
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,360
 But anyway, lots of royals and stuff

88
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,840
 would eat lampries, right?

89
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,440
 - Was it Henry II?

90
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,280
 - I mean, the first, I think.

91
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,120
 - The first?

92
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,960
 - The first surfeit of lampries.

93
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,080
 - He died from a surfeit of lampries.

94
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,440
 But in all the jubilee celebrations throughout history,

95
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,960
 they've always had lamprey pie in Britain.

96
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,900
 And Queen Elizabeth's platinum jubilee was the first,

97
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,020
 since records began, that didn't have lamprey pie.

98
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,120
 And that's because lampries are kind of endangered

99
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,480
 at the moment, especially in Europe.

100
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,240
 It's really hard to get hold of lampries.

101
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,920
 - For her diamond jubilee in 2012, they had lamprey pie,

102
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,160
 but they brought the lampries in from North America

103
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,960
 where they're slightly less endangered.

104
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,600
 - But I can't believe they were still making lamprey pie,

105
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,600
 which sounds like an incredibly old fashioned

106
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,720
 18th century thing.

107
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,320
 - Well, lampries still exist and pies still exist, right?

108
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,760
 - Yeah, but you don't, it's not on as many menus

109
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,200
 as it was in the 1600s.

110
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,600
 Let's face it, I've never had lamprey pie.

111
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,200
 - I can't picture a lamprey, by the way.

112
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,840
 - It's like an eel, but then if you look at its face,

113
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,640
 it looks like an alien from a movie.

114
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,200
 - It's like a sea leech, basically.

115
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,840
 They're just long, gross tubes with nasty mouths.

116
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,840
 - But like the mouth is...

117
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,680
 - Yes, I know them now.

118
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,200
 - Right, so for the listener, they don't have a jaw,

119
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,320
 so they don't have a normal mouth

120
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,680
 that goes snap, snap, snap like ours,

121
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,400
 but they've got a perfect circle,

122
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,120
 and then it's covered in teeth,

123
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,320
 and then also they've got a tongue,

124
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,120
 which is also covered in teeth.

125
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,600
 And so the way they suck blood,

126
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,840
 and they suck a hell of a lot, don't they?

127
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,320
 They latch onto a big fish, like a 40 pound fish,

128
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,640
 they can drain it dry.

129
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,720
 So a giant carp, they can drain dry

130
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,560
 by just latching on, sucking on,

131
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,600
 and then they drill their toothed tongue into the fish,

132
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,920
 probing like a boar hole.

133
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,760
 - It's so gross.

134
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,720
 - There's a horror movie from 2014 called

135
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,320
 Blood Lake, Attack of the Killer Lamprey's Brickhead,

136
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,080
 in which the mare gets eaten by a lamprey

137
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,160
 who comes up and bites him from his toilet.

138
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,000
 - Awesome.

139
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,840
 - Oh my.

140
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,680
 - Toiler alert, sorry.

141
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,240
 - They sound like the ocean Mongolian death worm, basically,

142
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,440
 and they look exactly like them.

143
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,800
 - I think like pretty much all these horror film monsters

144
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,600
 that are long and with lots of teeth

145
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,160
 must be based on lampreys, right?

146
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,480
 - Yeah, so are we saying that the royals like lampreys

147
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,320
 because they contain the blood that they need?

148
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,560
 Is that why lamprey pie is such a treat for the royals?

149
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,400
 - It must be.

150
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,240
 - 'Cause we've made them sound absolutely disgusting to eat,

151
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,320
 as in that these horrible blood tube alien things.

152
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,920
 - Yeah, you'd want it hidden under the crust of a pie, I think.

153
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,760
 (all laughing)

154
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,600
 - Yeah, it's not the most.

155
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,960
 - The most disgusting blanket of anonymity of the pastry, yeah.

156
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,400
 - Well, just while we're on fishy things that drink blood,

157
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,920
 you guys will have heard of the candiru, I'm sure.

158
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,620
 These are the fish that don't swim up your penis.

159
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,460
 (all laughing)

160
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,800
 - Like all other fish.

161
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,320
 (all laughing)

162
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,800
 - The one species.

163
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,680
 - There are actually competitions to see what fish

164
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,760
 you can get up there.

165
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,840
 Some people get sharks up their penises and they really brag.

166
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,080
 - I had an orca up there.

167
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,520
 (all laughing)

168
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,360
 - Awkward.

169
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,800
 (all laughing)

170
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,080
 - So these, they're a kind of catfish.

171
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,800
 - And the one thing they're famous for is the myth

172
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,920
 that they will swim up your penis and.

173
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,800
 - Are you saying it's definitely a myth then?

174
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,680
 'Cause I know that the idea that they can swim up

175
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,400
 the stream of urine as you're urinating into the water

176
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,240
 is definitely a myth.

177
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,280
 - That's what I thought was the myth, yeah.

178
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,760
 - Well, so what the classic modus operandi is,

179
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,320
 they will infiltrate the slits of the gills

180
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,680
 of a larger catfish.

181
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,280
 They'll grip onto the flesh inside,

182
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,600
 they'll break a blood vessel,

183
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,000
 they'll drink from the blood vessel

184
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,360
 and then they'll swim out of the gills again.

185
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,560
 That's what they normally do.

186
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,920
 So obviously, the idea is that, you know,

187
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,240
 they think a penis looks a bit like a fish's gill

188
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,800
 and they swim into it, they're drawn to it.

189
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,400
 Fish urinate through their gills, so.

190
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,240
 - There we go.

191
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,400
 - We'll urinate through our penises.

192
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,240
 - Exactly.

193
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,060
 - Half of us.

194
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,400
 - It's so easy to see what the mistakes are.

195
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,000
 - Better to be circumcised, I reckon,

196
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,840
 if you're up against one of these guys.

197
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,000
 I think it looks less gill-like, but continue.

198
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,360
 (all laughing)

199
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,720
 - Okay, there's how it is.

200
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,560
 - That's my opinion.

201
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,400
 - There's how it is.

202
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,600
 Health and cosmetic tip for the week.

203
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,080
 - Tune in next week to find out what that shit thing is.

204
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,920
 Say then.

205
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,280
 - I'm not going to your fish, my goodness.

206
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,400
 - Is your penis too gill-like?

207
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,720
 Have you considered?

208
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,920
 (all laughing)

209
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,760
 Sorry, do go on.

210
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,000
 - The point is that the candiru has only once

211
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,880
 swam up someone's urethra.

212
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,720
 - That's enough.

213
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,080
 - That's more than most fish.

214
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,760
 (all laughing)

215
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,840
 - But then it died.

216
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,440
 So it wasn't a, it died and was able to be,

217
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,280
 it was removed.

218
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,560
 I imagine it was removed, actually.

219
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,840
 - Why did it die?

220
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,680
 - I don't know why it died.

221
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,760
 Are you saying it's just one individual curious fish

222
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,520
 that did this and the rest of his species

223
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,360
 would never do it?

224
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,760
 - Yeah, I think so.

225
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,960
 Although actually this is only once

226
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,880
 in the medical literature.

227
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,720
 - Yeah.

228
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,960
 - See, I imagine because if it swims into a catfish gill,

229
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,000
 it remains in water.

230
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,480
 So it has water around it.

231
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,000
 If it swam into someone's penis,

232
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,440
 they probably jumped out of the water

233
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,440
 and then now it's out of its habitat, right?

234
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,280
 - Might well do.

235
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,320
 That might well be the case.

236
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,160
 - Yeah.

237
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,280
 - Anyway, it's not something to worry about much.

238
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,480
 (all laughing)

239
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,160
 - Did you guys know that Timothy Dalton went out

240
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,880
 with K.A.D.?

241
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,720
 - Really?

242
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,560
 - No.

243
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,400
 - So K.A.D., the war correspondent.

244
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,440
 - K.A.D., very famous British war correspondent,

245
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,840
 the ultimate war correspondent, really.

246
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,240
 They went out, they were in national youth theater together

247
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,080
 or so they were in a theater group together.

248
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,920
 And--

249
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,720
 - Since when have we become Hello Magazine?

250
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,560
 (all laughing)

251
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,400
 - I quite like it.

252
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,240
 - This is the weirdest section of Hello Magazine.

253
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,200
 (all laughing)

254
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,520
 - I really want to start like a gossip magazine

255
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,680
 or podcast but about like really like obscure

256
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,000
 where people no one cares about

257
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,400
 like K.A.D.'s form of sex life.

258
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,960
 She said of Timothy Dalton,

259
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,280
 he was a very shy young man

260
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,120
 but I even sewed up his tights for him

261
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,400
 while they were on.

262
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,240
 (all laughing)

263
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,080
 - Wow.

264
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,240
 - You're saying it as if it's a very sexy thing.

265
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,080
 - Guys.

266
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,920
 - I think sewing up someone's tights

267
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,720
 is actually the least sexual thing you can do.

268
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,960
 - With a pair of tights at least.

269
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,800
 - Yeah.

270
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,640
 - Yeah.

271
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,400
 - While they're on, I mean if you're sewing it up

272
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,600
 towards the crotch area.

273
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,120
 - He didn't say that, I couldn't be in the toe.

274
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,560
 - She could have stuck a pin through his cock.

275
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,440
 I mean, it might not be sexy at all.

276
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,520
 - That can be sexy.

277
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,360
 - Yeah.

278
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,200
 - Oh God.

279
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,040
 (all laughing)

280
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,200
 - It's K.A.D., it's sexy.

281
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,040
 - Yeah.

282
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,880
 - No, it's not.

283
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,700
 - Anyway, so that's some hot gauze.

284
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,540
 - That is hot gauze.

285
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,600
 - That's hot fresh, fresh from the mid 1980s.

286
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,440
 - Yeah.

287
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,800
 - One famous scientist in this kind of plant sentience area

288
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,840
 is Suzanne Simard.

289
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,240
 We've spoken before about her work

290
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,280
 with mycorrhizal networks.

291
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,520
 So the idea that you've got lots of trees

292
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,320
 and they have their roots

293
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,640
 and on the roots they have funguses

294
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,120
 and the fungus can kind of talk to each other

295
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,280
 and that means the trees can talk to each other

296
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,440
 and that means that if one tree is in trouble

297
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,280
 with something they can pass on the message

298
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,680
 to all the other trees, like an internet of plants.

299
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,800
 - Get out of here.

300
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,640
 I can't.

301
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,360
 (all laughing)

302
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,400
 - But some of her more recent stuff is that she's worked out

303
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:50,320
 that kind of the patterns that these networks of trees create

304
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,260
 are very, very similar to the patterns

305
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,760
 in your neural network in your brain.

306
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,760
 And so the trees in like a forest

307
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,880
 is really, really similar to a human brain.

308
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,720
 - What?

309
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,280
 - And not only that, some of the chemicals

310
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,520
 that they move between the roots are glutamates

311
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,000
 and glutamates are also the neurotransmitters

312
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,320
 that you use in your brain.

313
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,080
 So it's almost like underneath the trees,

314
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,560
 there is something that's not just analogous to a brain

315
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,160
 but is also structured like a brain

316
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,960
 and uses the same chemicals as a brain.

317
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,140
 - What we're saying is the planet,

318
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,760
 the trees are the brain of the world.

319
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,560
 - No, the trees are like an upside down person

320
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,400
 with the brain at the bottom and the legs in the air.

321
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,320
 - The trees are the hair and under the skull, soil,

322
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,960
 is the brain.

323
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,520
 - I prefer legs in the air.

324
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,800
 (all laughing)

325
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,420
 - It's more fun anyway.

326
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,600
 - Legs in the air is always more fun.

327
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,840
 - So the trees are the--

328
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,060
 - Legs.

329
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,520
 - The trunks of the trees are the legs of the planet.

330
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,960
 So the roots of the brain.

331
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,800
 - Right?

332
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,640
 - Yeah.

333
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,960
 - You're really struggling with this.

334
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,800
 Have you had a stroke?

335
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,300
 - I'm just gonna stretch it out to the whole world.

336
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:55,320
 So the trees, this network is the planet's brain effectively.

337
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,160
 - Yes.

338
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,300
 - I think that's what James was saying.

339
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,140
 - Sure.

340
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,200
 (all laughing)

341
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,440
 - I think just next time you see a forest,

342
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,080
 think of it as a bunch of legs waving in the air

343
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,280
 and you'll enjoy your walk a bit more.

344
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,400
 - And the genitals, I guess,

345
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,280
 'cause that's where you pollinate, right?

346
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,880
 So upside down with the balls in the air.

347
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,720
 - Good point, yeah.

348
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,080
 - Well, I'm gonna close my eyes the next time I see a tree.

349
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,040
 (all laughing)

350
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,880
 - Peep brood.

351
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,760
 (all laughing)

352
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,160
 - Did you guys see the thing about the real life vampires?

353
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,080
 As in people who drink blood?

354
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,700
 - No.

355
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,880
 - I've seen a documentary on them.

356
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,360
 They're mostly quite weird.

357
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,720
 - Not professionally, I was about to say,

358
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,120
 but kind of as a compelled to do it.

359
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,960
 - As a hobby.

360
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,760
 - As a hobby, it is a hobby, yeah, yeah.

361
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,080
 You need to get lots of health certificates

362
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,400
 and things these days,

363
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,160
 from the people whose blood you're drinking,

364
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,880
 'cause you can get all sorts of diseases through blood.

365
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,040
 It's an incredibly unsafe thing to do, it's general.

366
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,280
 - Yeah, I read an article about the Atlanta Vampire Alliance

367
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,080
 and they said that there are at least 5,000 people

368
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:52,120
 in the U.S. that identify as real vampires at the moment,

369
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,040
 but not all of them actually drink blood, apparently,

370
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,200
 'cause you're trying to get life force from someone,

371
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,240
 apparently some of them think that you can still

372
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,280
 be a vampire, but get the life force

373
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,980
 by giving someone a massage.

374
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,820
 - What?

375
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,660
 - What?

376
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,500
 - No.

377
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,320
 - Cheesy.

378
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,880
 - That's what they say.

379
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,920
 You're collecting the psychic energy of someone,

380
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,440
 but instead of taking it through the blood,

381
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,840
 'cause that's a bit icky,

382
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,560
 you can do it through a nice little massage.

383
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,200
 - I think you've got, there's gotta be some ingested

384
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,240
 of some part of that.

385
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,860
 You could maybe eat their dandruff.

386
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,920
 (laughing)

387
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,680
 A friendly veggie vampire.

388
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,520
 - Yeah?

389
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,340
 - Yeah.

390
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,180
 - What do they do then?

391
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,360
 Do they sleep in coffins?

392
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,840
 Do they sleep in the day?

393
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,680
 Do they--

394
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,080
 - They meet online and talkbots,

395
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,720
 and then occasionally have in-person meetings

396
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,520
 where they talk about.

397
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,360
 Talk about.

398
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,200
 - Massaging each other.

399
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,040
 - Massaging each other.

400
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,640
 - It's mostly drinking blood based, though, isn't it?

401
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,520
 Rather than, they don't do the garlic thing or the--

402
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,920
 - They can be seen in mirrors.

403
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,080
 (laughing)

404
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,920
 - They're not dead.

405
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,960
 - Not destroyed in light.

406
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,780
 - Yeah.

407
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,640
 - Cape sails have not rocketed.

408
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,560
 - Right.

409
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,840
 But those party teeth.

410
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,640
 - They've all bought them, yeah.

411
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,520
 - Those are apparently not good to drink blood with.

412
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,920
 Vampire bats don't have those.

413
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,040
 Their sharp teeth are right at the front.

414
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,040
 They do have some sharpened teeth,

415
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,240
 but they're right at the front,

416
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,960
 and they just scratch until there's blood exposed,

417
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,800
 and then they lap it up.

418
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,960
 - Oh, okay.

419
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,240
 - Yeah, cute, really.

420
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,600
 - And they're more likely to bite you

421
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,320
 on your big toe, aren't they?

422
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,240
 - Oh, you're right.

423
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,880
 - They tend to not fly onto you, bats,

424
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,760
 and then eat you from your neck.

425
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,240
 They tend to land a fair distance away from you.

426
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,240
 You might be lying down,

427
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,080
 sunbathing or sleeping or something,

428
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,280
 and then they walk up to you on the ground,

429
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,000
 and then they just kind of grab any exposed little bit,

430
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,600
 which might be your fertile, your big toe.

431
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,440
 - You can see why Bram Stoker sexed it up a bit.

432
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,640
 Rather than just saying Dracula's sucking away on your toes.

433
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,480
 I don't know, yeah.

434
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,760
 - The fetishist out there, like a hood.

435
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,560
 - I didn't know (beep) was a vampire.

436
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,560
 (all laughing)

437
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,720
 - There's the lawsuit bell, ding-a-ling.

438
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,320
 - I can hear the lawyers making money, money, money.

439
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,000
 - One good time to be selfish is if you have a partner

440
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,520
 who's very altruistic.

441
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:59,480
 So it's, you don't want two altruistic people

442
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,800
 in a relationship or two selfish people,

443
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,820
 but it is useful to have one selfish person

444
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:08,660
 and one altruistic person in the specific time

445
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,840
 that you're trying to work out what movie to watch

446
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,600
 or what restaurant to go to or something like that.

447
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,600
 - Who should have the last chip?

448
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,900
 - Who should have the last chip?

449
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,480
 Because otherwise, if both of you are too altruistic,

450
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,440
 you end up, neither of you have any chips.

451
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,360
 If you're both greedy, you end up fighting.

452
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,240
 (all laughing)

453
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,600
 So this was a study, I mean, it's quite, you know,

454
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,760
 obvious that that would happen,

455
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,760
 but there was a study that proved it.

456
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,200
 They got people to watch a load of clips of different shows,

457
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,240
 like for instance, clips of Saturday Night Live,

458
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,240
 some that are funny, some that are more interesting,

459
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,640
 some that are more, you know, like horror films and stuff.

460
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,040
 And they rated how much they liked each one.

461
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,480
 And they also did surveys to measure how selfish they were.

462
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,560
 And then a few weeks later, they were divided into pairs.

463
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,800
 And when you got two selfish people together

464
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,760
 or two altruistic people together,

465
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,800
 it turned out that whatever they chose to watch

466
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,640
 was something that neither of them liked.

467
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,960
 When they looked at their old survey,

468
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,880
 they found that actually neither of you liked this,

469
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,040
 but you ended up watching something kind of,

470
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,320
 you compromised to something that neither of you liked.

471
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,120
 - God, I've been in that situation so many times.

472
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,200
 Have you not all done that?

473
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,520
 (all laughing)

474
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,360
 - Yeah, exactly, yeah.

475
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,120
 - No, I think I'm the selfish one.

476
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,200
 - Oh my God, you're always in there

477
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,560
 watching something you love and you're poor white,

478
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,040
 grinding away for another Arnold Schwarzenegger.

479
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,000
 - It's just the Tom Cruise mission impossible marathons.

480
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,760
 - Back to back, yeah.

481
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,840
 - Can we at least watch a different mission impossible?

482
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,180
 - No.

483
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,040
 Six is the best.

484
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,380
 - Yep.

485
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,520
 - Can we split the chip in half, Andy?

486
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,680
 (all laughing)

487
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,880
 - It's already disappearing down my throat.

488
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,120
 Have you guys heard of Sabbath mode?

489
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,960
 - No.

490
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,800
 - This is cool.

491
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,320
 Lots of dishwashers are Sabbath mode.

492
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,920
 And it's because there's this big argument in Judaism

493
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,280
 about electricity on the Sabbath Shabbat.

494
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,400
 If you turn on a light,

495
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,400
 are you technically igniting a fire band?

496
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,640
 Or are you theoretically cooking something also banned?

497
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,080
 Or are you completing a product?

498
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,440
 The product is incandescent light, also banned.

499
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,480
 So this is a big problem.

500
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,200
 And in 1998, Whirlpool's KitchenAid line of products,

501
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,000
 they introduced Sabbath mode.

502
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,200
 And it's basically just, I mean, it's just timers, isn't it?

503
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,800
 - But they did that with a lot of products in America.

504
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,280
 And they do things like with,

505
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,500
 if you, 'cause America and New York, let's say,

506
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,880
 there's a lot of high-rise buildings

507
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,240
 and a lot of people living in flats.

508
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,440
 So if you have an elderly Jewish family

509
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,680
 that are living on the fifth floor,

510
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,200
 how do they get up if they can't press

511
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,200
 the elevator button to take them up?

512
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,640
 So on Sabbath, the elevators are designed

513
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,480
 so that they just stop at every floor on that day.

514
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,800
 And it means that you can get in there without touching it.

515
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,280
 But I like the Sabbath Goy,

516
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,760
 which is what I guess all of us would be,

517
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,340
 which is if you have friends who are Jewish

518
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,680
 and they are very strict on Sabbath day

519
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,960
 and they can't touch things,

520
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,960
 they're not explicitly allowed to ask

521
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,920
 for you to do something on their behalf.

522
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,720
 But they can kind of subtly suggest it like,

523
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,560
 "Oh, I want to be greater."

524
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,680
 - There's a bloody dark in here.

525
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,240
 (all laughing)

526
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,080
 - I think not one or two,

527
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,200
 'cause I used to live up in Tottenham

528
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,800
 and I never did 'cause I was usually at work,

529
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,400
 but my housemate used to sometimes be asked

530
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,680
 to go around to our neighbor's house

531
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,920
 to switch stuff on for them,

532
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,240
 which I didn't realize we could have been like,

533
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,720
 "Actually, pal, you're breaking your own laws there,"

534
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,560
 by asking.

535
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,920
 - How strictly you take care of it.

536
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,760
 - There's so much to it.

537
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,600
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

538
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,640
 - They're obviously taking it quite strictly enough

539
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,480
 not to do it themselves, but not quite.

540
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,440
 That's where they've drawn the line.

541
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,600
 - Everyone draws the line somewhere, don't they?

542
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,440
 - But did they explicitly,

543
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,080
 do we know the language that was used?

544
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:26,920
 - I don't actually know.

545
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,760
 Maybe it was a hint.

546
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,600
 - Yeah.

547
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,600
 - I'm gonna have to draw that.

548
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,280
 Well, someone's gonna have to draw me a line.

549
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,040
 (all laughing)

550
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:36,400
 - So, here's a cool thing about the first film,

551
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,460
 the first avatar.

552
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,260
 It was filmed on this massive great set.

553
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,680
 It was like a hanger

554
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,400
 and it was called The Volume, this huge space, right?

555
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,600
 And it was where another great project

556
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,600
 had been put together.

557
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,080
 - Can we guess?

558
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,680
 - Massive hanger in California.

559
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,480
 - It was where they made the space shuttle.

560
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,320
 - Oh, you're so close.

561
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,120
 It's aeronautics.

562
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,920
 - It's where the Wright brothers made the first plane.

563
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,760
 - It's in between those two.

564
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,600
 - Concorde?

565
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,440
 - Oh, good.

566
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,040
 - Have you heard of The Spruce Goose?

567
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:04,880
 - Oh, yeah.

568
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,720
 - How are you?

569
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:10,080
 - The largest plane in the world was made in the hanger

570
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,120
 where the largest movie in the world

571
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,960
 went on to be made, yeah.

572
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,160
 - Wasn't it The Largest Seaplane?

573
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,480
 Is it The Largest plane in the world?

574
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,480
 - It was humongous, wasn't it?

575
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,680
 And it's made out of wood.

576
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,760
 - It was made in almost entirely out of wood.

577
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,720
 And I think at the time it was the largest plane,

578
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,200
 as in the Boeing 747 was bigger,

579
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,440
 but that was 30 years before the 747.

580
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,200
 90% birch and then some rice paper

581
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,920
 and some aluminum paint over the top of it.

582
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,760
 And it was also--

583
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,120
 - It was rice paper?

584
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,440
 - Yeah, rice paper was involved in the construction.

585
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,560
 - And the passengers also had eating the plane.

586
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,800
 (all laughing)

587
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,720
 - And it was 1942, you started making it.

588
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,360
 And it was, or he'd been working on it for years.

589
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,800
 And he spent, how would he use this as the,

590
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,120
 again, eccentric.

591
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,440
 - Very eccentric.

592
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,240
 Used to measure his carrots before he ate them and stuff.

593
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,640
 - Yeah, he used to keep bottles of whee with him.

594
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,880
 - Yeah, he had a sad decline.

595
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,240
 He became very isolated and obsessive.

596
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,080
 And you know, had a--

597
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,720
 - Well, this was part of it, I think, wasn't it?

598
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,840
 - Well, it was the sort of grand project

599
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,960
 that might have pushed him quite far.

600
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,680
 - And played by Leonardo DiCaprio in a movie

601
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,760
 who also play the aviator.

602
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,440
 But isn't that weird that the aviator,

603
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,480
 what does that almost exactly the same as?

604
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,600
 - Avatar.

605
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,520
 - It's the Avatar aviator.

606
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,200
 - It was the West Country Avatar, wasn't it?

607
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,080
 (all laughing)

608
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,120
 - And it cost about $300 million in modern money,

609
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,920
 slightly more than the film Avatar.

610
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,760
 Isn't that weird?

611
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,600
 - More than that.

612
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,400
 - Yeah, yeah, and the wings were 11 feet deep.

613
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,640
 You could walk comfortably inside the wings.

614
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,400
 Guess how long it flew for in total?

615
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,920
 Total aggregate time?

616
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,480
 - I thought it only flew once.

617
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,920
 - Well, maybe it flew a few times,

618
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,760
 but yeah, maybe a couple of hours.

619
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,600
 - 30 seconds.

620
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,440
 - 30 seconds, absolutely.

621
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,280
 - 30 seconds.

622
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,120
 - It had one test flight where--

623
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,640
 - We'd travel us on board, right?

624
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,920
 - Well, it was a test flight

625
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,760
 just seeing if it could handle moving around,

626
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,880
 basically, on the water, and then it did take off.

627
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,000
 And there was always a question over

628
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,240
 whether Howard Hughes had actually planned that all along

629
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,600
 and flew once in 1947 for half a minute, and that was it.

630
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,440
 - So weird, we got a tweet, actually, last night, I think,

631
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,920
 just before, as we were researching this show,

632
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,960
 from a guy called Chris Nobel, who follows us on Twitter,

633
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,880
 who was pointing us to a thread, did you see it?

634
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,760
 A thread on Twitter of loads of interesting facts

635
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,600
 about punctuation.

636
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,520
 It was by someone called @CulturalTutor,

637
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,200
 and some of my favorite things were,

638
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,760
 well, I really didn't know how old the @ symbol was,

639
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,520
 and I don't think we've mentioned that before.

640
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,440
 - I think it's an old shipping thing.

641
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,760
 - I thought it was an accountancy thing.

642
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,440
 So it's like five bushels at one pound each.

643
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,760
 - You actually could both be right,

644
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,840
 'cause it served lots of purposes over the years

645
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,920
 from medieval times.

646
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,280
 So it was used in medieval Bulgaria for the A in Amen.

647
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,520
 If you couldn't be asked to write Amen at the end of a prayer,

648
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,920
 you just do the @ symbol.

649
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:48,480
 Yep, it was an abbreviation for a weight in Spain,

650
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,000
 and it was, by the 17th century, actually, in France,

651
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,440
 it was being used as short for @.

652
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,000
 So that symbol all the way around.

653
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,840
 Isn't that so weird?

654
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,120
 Yeah, I do see that in lots of old medieval texts, yes.

655
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,720
 - It feels like if you're doing a prayer,

656
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,600
 you shouldn't be just taking shortcuts all the time.

657
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,440
 - I don't know why.

658
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,040
 You've struggled all the way to the end.

659
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,840
 The power and the glory, blah, blah, blah.

660
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,320
 Let's get out of the church.

661
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,800
 - Was that the only one?

662
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,920
 - No, so other good stuff.

663
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,880
 I liked the oldest punctuation mark in history

664
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,960
 that stayed unchanged as the asterisk.

665
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,280
 - Oh, okay.

666
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,720
 - I think it's been quite modern.

667
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,920
 But yeah, it was used to correct a piece of Homer

668
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,160
 in the second century BC.

669
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,800
 - So was it used as a footnote,

670
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,160
 as in that's where the correction

671
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,160
 would appear underneath?

672
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,520
 Wow, that's cool. - Yeah, in the same way,

673
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,680
 I believe, yeah. - That's good.

674
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,600
 - And I also didn't know that.

675
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,560
 I mean, this is really too nerdy

676
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,520
 and no one's gonna care except weird pettance.

677
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,080
 But you know the possessive apostrophe--

678
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,400
 - And presumably there's a person who tweeted it.

679
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,360
 - And me, so at least I'm with the same.

680
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,200
 - Probably our entire listenership, I would think.

681
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,360
 - Exactly.

682
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,960
 You all know it's a compliment.

683
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,600
 The possessive apostrophe is actually--

684
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,080
 - Come out, come out, come out.

685
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,200
 (laughing)

686
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,680
 - The possessive apostrophe is actually exactly the same

687
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,840
 as the apostrophe that denotes a missing letter.

688
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,280
 So you know if you say it's with an apostrophe,

689
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,880
 to mean it is, 'cause you're denoting

690
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,360
 that the I is missing. - Yeah, right.

691
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,440
 - Actually, the possessive one, as in Andy's jumper,

692
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,360
 it used to be that you'd write a possessive as ES.

693
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,160
 And so it would be A-N-D-Y-E-S, jumper.

694
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,120
 - Andy's jumper. - Yeah.

695
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,120
 And then they just, you started using the,

696
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,840
 or we've missed out the E here.

697
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,760
 And so it's the same, look, it's the same thing.

698
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,920
 - It's like a genitive ending in other languages.

699
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,440
 - It's a genitive ending, yeah.

700
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,840
 - Interesting.

701
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,320
 - So that is interesting for a few--

702
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,640
 - That's a nice funny bit to end the section on.

703
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,800
 (humming)

704
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,560
 (laughing)

705
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,440
 - Would you rather have a general anaesthetic

706
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,520
 or watch an episode of Only Fools and Horses?

707
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,360
 (laughing)

708
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,640
 - Definitely the anaesthetic.

709
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,840
 (laughing)

710
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,680
 - Which episode is it?

711
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,760
 The one where Delboy falls through the bars?

712
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,600
 - Yeah, of course.

713
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,440
 - I can watch that.

714
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,760
 (laughing)

715
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,280
 - This was a thing that was tried in the year 2010.

716
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,400
 It was--

717
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,240
 - Did they really?

718
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,080
 - Yeah. - Well, they tried

719
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,080
 to knock you out by watching Only Fools and Horses.

720
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,800
 - Well, they, so it was a study

721
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,880
 on what makes people need less anaesthesia

722
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,880
 and watching DVDs seemed to genuinely help

723
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,880
 and mean people could get by with a local anaesthetic

724
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,320
 rather than a general.

725
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,800
 So you'd normally need to be knocked out

726
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,160
 for these procedures, but people were,

727
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,920
 it was a doctor called Nick Pace who,

728
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,560
 and he just brought in his own DVDs from home.

729
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,560
 So we also had Blue Planet and Mamma Mia

730
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,880
 and other things and some of them.

731
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,200
 - But it looked a taste, Nick.

732
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,040
 Nice.

733
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:25,880
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

734
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,440
 He contains multitudes and basically it works

735
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,240
 and distraction through whatever means

736
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,080
 means you need less anaesthesia.

737
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,240
 And there's been a recent study

738
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,120
 which had VR headsets and also meant

739
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,000
 that people need way less anaesthesia

740
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,720
 'cause they just put you on a calm mountain top.

741
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,560
 - At all, yeah.

742
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,040
 - Oh, they don't put you inside Pecker.

743
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,240
 (laughing)

744
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,080
 - All right, Dave.

745
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,360
 - You are Triggers Broome and you're moving along.

746
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,440
 - You did that with Billy Conley,

747
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,320
 playing Billy Conley to patients, didn't they?

748
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,160
 - Oh, yeah, yeah.

749
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,440
 - They medically proved that Billy Conley

750
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,800
 makes you feel less pain.

751
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,720
 And I think what they did was they made them put their hands

752
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,280
 in like a cold ice bucket or something

753
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,120
 and they felt it less

754
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,360
 when they had Billy's comedy being played to them.

755
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,600
 - Oh, yeah, yeah.

756
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,840
 - But Nick Pace said that some patients were disappointed

757
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,120
 because the operation ended

758
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,600
 before they got to the end of their DVD

759
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,920
 of "Opening Fools and Horses."

760
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,760
 - Really?

761
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,520
 (laughing)

762
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,080
 - I've just one more thing on the Imara people

763
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,720
 who are indigenous Bolivians, which is really cool.

764
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,720
 So they're really well-known,

765
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,120
 the women for their really amazing knitting skills,

766
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,080
 hundreds of years.

767
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,040
 They've been hand knitting really intricate stuff.

768
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,680
 And there was this great story,

769
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,080
 I think it was about 10 years ago

770
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,240
 where doctors have been trying to solve this problem

771
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,680
 in Bolivia for ages of there being 10 times as many babies

772
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,680
 as is the norm born with holes in their hearts.

773
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,600
 And it's 'cause of the high altitude.

774
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,880
 So something happens in utero.

775
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,120
 And it's a problem you often need to operate on them.

776
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,480
 And a doctor designed these,

777
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,040
 like they look like actually mini top hats,

778
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,120
 which you put up somebody in a catheter

779
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,440
 and it travels up to the heart

780
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,840
 and it blocks up the hole.

781
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,320
 - It travels up to the heart.

782
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,040
 - I know, it's kind of amazing.

783
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,640
 Anyway, it's made with tiny intricate bits of wire

784
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,120
 and it has to be knitted.

785
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,400
 And it's too intricate for a machine to do it.

786
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,040
 And so this guy thought, "Hey, who's really good at knitting?"

787
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,360
 And he called up the Imara women and said,

788
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,600
 "Can you start knitting really, really tiny wire hats

789
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,080
 "to put in baby's hearts to block their holes up?"

790
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:19,920
 And they did.

791
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,440
 So this is what they do now.

792
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,440
 No more woolly hats for the Imara kids, but...

793
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,560
 - That is pretty amazing.

794
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,640
 - But warm hearts.

795
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,480
 - But warm.

796
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,600
 - Oh, God.

797
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,760
 - Really warm heart, that story.

798
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,920
 - That is gross.

799
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,600
 (laughing)

800
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,080
 - Well, I've just got one more thing about

801
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:41,080
 on the subject of gruesome animal trophies being worn.

802
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:41,920
 - Oh yeah.

803
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,160
 - This is actually, it's not a thing being worn,

804
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,360
 but it is a Bolivian thing.

805
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,600
 There's a big tradition in Bolivia of llama fetuses.

806
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,840
 This is a huge, huge deal.

807
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,680
 Yeah, yeah.

808
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,640
 - Of wearing them?

809
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,040
 - Not wearing them, no, that's the thing,

810
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,440
 but they are incredibly lucky.

811
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,200
 So they're sold in so-called witch's markets.

812
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,040
 - Yeah, really?

813
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,040
 - I think they're called sulus,

814
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,200
 I'm probably pronouncing that wrong,

815
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,680
 but they, and you know,

816
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,960
 there are all stages of development.

817
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,200
 They can be very, very tiny,

818
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,480
 or they can be kind of miniature llamas, basically,

819
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,640
 with wool on them.

820
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,320
 And if you know what's good for you,

821
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,720
 you'll bury one in the foundations of your house.

822
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,040
 - Right, really?

823
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,840
 - Very lucky, very auspicious property, yeah.

824
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,200
 - Oh, God, 'cause you wouldn't think at looking at a llama.

825
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,840
 I've never seen a llama fetus, but I don't imagine it looks like it.

826
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,840
 - They're not very, they're not as cute as llamas.

827
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,560
 - No, no, no.

828
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,960
 - But it's the first question you'll ask

829
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,080
 in a state agent in Bolivia is-

830
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:32,920
 - On right move.

831
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,760
 - Absolutely.

832
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,600
 - Can you filter by that?

833
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,600
 - There's a special box.

834
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,760
 (all laughing)

835
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,960
 - llama fetus check, two bathrooms check, yeah.

836
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,040
 - You guys come across Peter Hicks.

837
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,880
 - Peter Hicks, no.

838
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,720
 - He was really famous in 1963,

839
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,960
 because he kept getting annoyed with parking tickets

840
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,520
 that he was getting in his van.

841
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,600
 And so he parked it up in Short's Gardens,

842
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,320
 which is just up the road from here.

843
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,280
 And he put on a device,

844
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,880
 which electrocuted traffic wardens in it.

845
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,200
 - Oh, wow.

846
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,040
 - Yeah.

847
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:07,280
 And he just, he became this massive core celebrity

848
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:11,120
 that if ever a traffic warden went to give him a ticket,

849
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,720
 they would get electrocuted.

850
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,000
 And I saw an interview with his son,

851
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,320
 and he said he used to deliberately drive around

852
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,400
 and park in a place where he knew he would get a ticket.

853
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,520
 And it would always be somewhere outside a pub.

854
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,520
 And then him and his mates would sit in the pub watching

855
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,680
 and waiting for a traffic warden to come along.

856
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,800
 - Presumably a pile of dead traffic warden

857
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,680
 be filled by the car.

858
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,400
 - He said that it's harmless,

859
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,920
 apart from a bit of a flash in a nasty jog.

860
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:41,280
 - You have fallen into your own pedantic trap

861
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,120
 that you always lay between electrocuted and electrified

862
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,600
 and implied that he was just murdering traffic wardens.

863
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,000
 - That's true, yeah, that's true.

864
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,640
 They were electrified.

865
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,840
 But he told the press,

866
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,280
 until someone tells me what law I'm breaking,

867
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,520
 I shall keep up my private war.

868
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,080
 And of course, they soon told him

869
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,840
 exactly what law he was breaking.

870
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,960
 I didn't know how much they were worth,

871
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,520
 'cause snail slime is useful for beauty and stuff, right?

872
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,880
 I think we might have mentioned it before,

873
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,600
 but you can farm snails and you can extract the slime

874
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,080
 and people put it on their faces

875
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,200
 and they think it makes them look younger.

876
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,600
 But the global snail beauty market

877
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,840
 is worth $340 million,

878
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,280
 which is about the same as Zoom is worth.

879
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,640
 - Wow. - Wow.

880
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,280
 - Yeah, so you could,

881
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,680
 if you're the guy who owns or girl who owns Zoom,

882
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,160
 I don't know who owns Zoom,

883
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:33,000
 you could sell it and buy all of the snail beauty products

884
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,240
 in the entire world.

885
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,480
 - And would you recommend that as a business choice?

886
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,840
 - It's just a would you rather, really, isn't it?

887
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,680
 - Yeah, yeah.

888
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,840
 - You'll have $340 million,

889
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:44,040
 but there's gonna be a snail chasing you,

890
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,680
 trying to make you look younger forever.

891
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,520
 - Trying to claim the money,

892
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,880
 'cause guys, do you know how much the snail see

893
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,520
 of that money?

894
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,440
 - Yeah, none.

895
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,280
 - It's nothing.

896
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,120
 - It's nothing, it's not expensive,

897
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,120
 but they must get sort of living,

898
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,120
 they must get treated quite well

899
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,200
 compared with snails and the water.

900
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,120
 - A nice lettuce leaf.

901
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,680
 - Yeah, well, that's one of the big things,

902
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,240
 'cause it used to be to extract the mucus,

903
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,520
 you needed to basically force the snail

904
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,080
 in order to produce it

905
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,440
 and you would do things like throw vinegar on a snail

906
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,960
 and that would make it in distress,

907
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,080
 kind of produce the mucus.

908
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,240
 Not really nice and it always dies afterwards.

909
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,840
 And so there's a place, it's in Italy,

910
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,960
 called the International Snail Breeding Institute,

911
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,320
 and there's a guy there who has basically come up

912
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,000
 with the concept of how you could treat them effectively

913
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,480
 to a day spa and get better fluids out of them.

914
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,600
 So here's the thing, happy snails produce better mucus.

915
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,680
 They produce it and it's more, it's richer,

916
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,320
 it's basically they're happy to give it out,

917
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,560
 whereas in the petrified vinegary version,

918
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,080
 they're like, well, and it just, it's not good.

919
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,040
 - I imagine it's equally useful

920
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,160
 for making you look younger, though.

921
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,000
 - Yeah.

922
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,840
 - Do you think it doesn't make you look younger?

923
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,280
 - I shouldn't have thought so.

924
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,200
 - You think it does?

925
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,720
 - I just think it does, but I've no evidence for it.

926
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,560
 - That explains why you've got

927
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,120
 10 snails on your face right now.

928
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,720
 (laughing)

929
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,560
 I don't think any of those things work, do they?

930
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,400
 - I don't know.

931
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,680
 - It seems unlikely.

932
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,120
 - As you say, it's a big industry

933
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,440
 and one thing, if you do use snail mucus on your face,

934
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,520
 if you're listening right now,

935
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,640
 make sure that whatever you buy

936
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,960
 doesn't say extract of snail slime slash mucus

937
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,760
 because it's effectively a watered down version.

938
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:14,840
 It's like, let's imagine ribena in like ribena

939
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,160
 in the ribena with water.

940
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,000
 - It's squash.

941
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,840
 - It's a snail squash.

942
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,680
 - It's a snail squash.

943
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,520
 - But given that neither is remotely effective,

944
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,840
 then you might as well get the cheaper one.

945
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,280
 - Why are we all alienating future advertisers like this?

946
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,600
 What are we doing?

947
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,000
 - You can get dried powder made from the snail slime.

948
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,800
 I don't know how useful that is,

949
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,120
 but it sells for $58,000 per kilo,

950
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,200
 which is 75 times more expensive than silver.

951
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,040
 - What?

952
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:37,880
 And what's that for?

953
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,040
 Is that for the skin as well?

954
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,360
 - That's for the skin as well.

955
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,600
 Most of the article says it costs more than gold,

956
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,280
 but gold has just overtaken it quite recently.

957
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,640
 - That'd be good to smuggle

958
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,560
 'cause no one would think to look for it.

959
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,440
 Like the cocaine dog would come by and you'd be fine

960
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,280
 because it's not cocaine.

961
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,760
 - The cocaine snail, though.

962
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,680
 (all laughing)

963
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,600
 - The trial of those didn't work as well,

964
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,040
 did it in airports.

965
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:00,880
 (all laughing)

966
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,240
 - It was three days later.

967
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,080
 - Hey.

968
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,760
 (all laughing)

969
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,160
 - I lost in a pub quiz recently

970
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:10,160
 to a group called the Big Titty Committee.

971
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,160
 (all laughing)

972
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,000
 Oh my God.

973
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,240
 - It's pretty sad, isn't it?

974
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,080
 - That is, yeah.

975
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,080
 - It's a bad time.

976
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,520
 - It's quite a good tactic in a pub quiz though,

977
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,840
 to stand up with a really stupid name.

978
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,200
 But actually you've been reading the Encyclopedia all day.

979
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,480
 Whatever it is you do in a pub quiz, you know.

980
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,920
 I would love it if every movie had

981
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,200
 what happened to all these characters after the film.

982
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,040
 - Would you?

983
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,640
 Because my wife hates them.

984
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,480
 - Oh, really?

985
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,600
 - She really, like, properly, as in,

986
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,520
 you know, there's a few things in your life,

987
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,920
 we do quite a lot of things, haven't we,

988
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,480
 that really, really, really gets you,

989
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,960
 even though most people don't care about them.

990
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,120
 - Well, I don't know what you mean,

991
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,920
 I'm a very relaxed guy, I'm not easily irritated.

992
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,400
 - Well, with Polina, it's these things at the end,

993
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,000
 and she reckons that if you're a storyteller,

994
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,360
 you shouldn't need them.

995
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,000
 Like, the story should go from the start to the finish,

996
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,240
 and you shouldn't have to add extra little bits at the end

997
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,560
 to say, oh, by the way, here's a bit we didn't fit in

998
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,520
 that you need to know in order for the rest of the story

999
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,360
 to make sense.

1000
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,720
 - And it's always, you would only ever see that,

1001
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,640
 or I've only ever seen that in non-fiction stuff,

1002
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,000
 like film documentaries, right,

1003
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 where it's like this person was released from prison

1004
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,280
 and lived happily ever after.

1005
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,960
 - I'm saying I want it in all films.

1006
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,560
 I want, at the end of Die Hard, I want to see,

1007
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,840
 John McClane went on to be in three more terrorist incidents

1008
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,200
 (laughing)

1009
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,400
 with steadily decreasing dramatic effects.

1010
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,800
 (laughing)

1011
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,000
 - But then I agree with that kind of, with that,

1012
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,560
 because you then lose, I remember seeing years ago,

1013
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,920
 there was a young Indiana Jones TV series,

1014
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:34,920
 and you see Indiana Jones as a very old man telling a story.

1015
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,520
 And I thought, well, okay, shit,

1016
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,400
 now I know he dies as a very old man.

1017
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,160
 I would rather not know where Indiana Jones met his ending.

1018
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,840
 And I know we have movies coming out now,

1019
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,280
 the latest one's coming out.

1020
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,280
 - 'Cause like, for instance, when you went to the cinema

1021
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,800
 and that big boulder was chasing him,

1022
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,280
 you're like, he's gonna get away.

1023
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,240
 (laughing)

1024
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,720
 I've seen him.

1025
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,360
 - Barge Haulers was a job, and they used to be naked.

1026
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,440
 - Barge Haulers, was that?

1027
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,280
 - Oh, yes.

1028
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,240
 - Was it when you're like on the bank of the canal,

1029
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,200
 like tugging along at the river?

1030
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,520
 - Tugging the barge, yeah.

1031
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,080
 This was, I was reading about barge Haulers,

1032
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,920
 which was a job in lots of countries.

1033
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:08,920
 And in China on the Yangtze, then they would, what?

1034
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,200
 - Yangtze, like, it sounds like Yangtze,

1035
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,960
 you're tugging someone on the Yangtze, you're naked.

1036
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,200
 - That's where it comes from, yeah.

1037
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,840
 But Yangtze didn't have a bridge until 1957.

1038
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,560
 And motor transport, not that common around,

1039
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:26,240
 especially like upper reaches of a 3000 kilometer long Yangtze.

1040
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,360
 And so the Haulers would haul your boat for you,

1041
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,360
 and they'd be naked.

1042
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,320
 'Cause wearing clothes hurt your skin.

1043
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,160
 - Oh, yeah.

1044
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,840
 (laughing)

1045
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,720
 - Not the act of hauling a massive boat up a river.

1046
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,560
 No, no, no.

1047
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,400
 - No, no, it's the bloody gloves.

1048
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,440
 (laughing)

1049
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,600
 - Oh, the chaffing.

1050
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,520
 - They just wanted to feel that soft rope on their skin.

1051
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,840
 I think also they ended up in the water hell of a lot.

1052
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,520
 So you don't get in the water too close.

1053
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,720
 - Oh, yeah, but they did, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1054
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,520
 Oh, I've fallen in them all wet.

1055
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,440
 (laughing)

1056
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,160
 - I've been breaking Chinese accent, you done?

1057
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,400
 (laughing)

1058
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,480
 - Okay, that's it for this week's episode.

1059
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,040
 I hope you enjoyed hearing Anna's voice again,

1060
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:08,160
 and I hope you enjoyed the general riffs.

1061
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:11,000
 As I said at the top, we are gonna be doing live shows.

1062
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,240
 Unfortunately, not with Anna, 'cause she will be away still,

1063
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:16,800
 but we do have some extraordinarily exciting guests

1064
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,200
