00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.500
 [music]

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.500
 Hi!

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.000
 No, it wasn't a good hi. I'm going to do it again.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 Mm-hmm.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 Hi, friends.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 Hi!

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 Hi, everybody.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 Welcome back to Drop As A Line.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 Six out of ten.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 [laughter]

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 Creepy laughter.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 That's two out of ten.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 Yeah, yeah, you've knocked off a few points there.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 Hi, everybody. Welcome back to Drop As A Line.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 The audience feedback, um, segment of...

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 It's been a while.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 It's been ages.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 Yeah.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 Two months.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 How's it?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 Yonks.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 Ah, we must have loads of feedback.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 Lots, actually.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 It's some positive.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 Well, let's stick with those.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 [laughter]

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 Okay, well, it's going to be a short show today.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 [laughter]

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 No, there's been some positive stuff.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 Some vulgar abuse, I'd say.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 Okay.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 A lot of stuff in the middle.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 Some great bonus info.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 But we might do an audience fact special again soon.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 Oh, yes.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 On main feed.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 For the, um, what are we calling the main listeners?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 Not you lovely club fish listeners.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 The plebs.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 The boy ploy.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 The paupers.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 Okay.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 The lovely, lovely people.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 Yeah.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 The cheapskates.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 The freeloaders.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 There we go.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 There we go.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 So, but there are some great stuff for you.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 Our premium gold club members.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 So, um...

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 The dupes.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 The dupes.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 [laughter]

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 Cheapskates on the dupes.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 Right.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 [laughter]

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 Ah.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.500
 Well, let's make that three pounds a month work for you right now as we read out our first

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.000
 email from Chuck Blower.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 [laughter]

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 Thank you, Chuck.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 It's good to be back.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 It's great.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 I'm serious.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 I'm serious.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.500
 Um, so he's, uh, he says some nice words and then he says, "I'm just finishing your last

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.440
 podcast that talks about wasabi and horseradish.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.000
 Not quite sure about this fact because I haven't actually had horseradish roots stuck up my

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 tongue.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.720
 But to my knowledge, and I have made horseradish sauce from scratch, you don't get the hot

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.000
 effect of the root till it's grated, the finer the grated, the more the heat."

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.600
 Um, so with all that said, I do not believe the root up of the wazoo would be as torturous

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.600
 as you might think.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.000
 I don't remember what this fact is.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 Well, I do, yeah.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.500
 We said that, and we also said it wouldn't hurt the wazoo because it's grated.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:21.300
 Well, possibly, yeah, I think I suggested that it might, um, because it's used to relieve

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:29.000
 constipation in horses, possibly a horseradish up the bum could, could give you some of the

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 spiciness.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.620
 But honestly, I think Chuck probably hasn't quite, you know, he's saying he thinks that.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.160
 He gives a little bit of evidence, but it's circumstantial at best.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.160
 We need more, we need more, Chuck.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.160
 I'm sorry.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.160
 That's not a scientist writing, is it?

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.600
 Did you only read the sign because of his name?

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.600
 No.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.760
 Now let's go to Phil Slack.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.820
 I imagine it could depend on how corrosive your anal passage was, couldn't it?

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:55.820
 Corrosive.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:56.820
 Well, because it's...

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:57.820
 Corrosive.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.980
 Yeah, so if you've got one that sort of does the grating as it goes up.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.380
 Oh, so how rough it is.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.380
 How rough it is, yeah.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.380
 How rough it is, yeah.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.380
 I see.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.380
 Yeah.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.380
 Yes.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.380
 Well, that's, um, wow.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:10.380
 Horrible.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.380
 Is that a medical thing?

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.380
 I'm just trying to justify James's point here.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.380
 Great.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.380
 Great point.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.380
 Thank you.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.380
 There we go.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.040
 That's from Phil Slack and it's on the same subject about horse radish.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.040
 Okay.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.040
 So Phil writes...

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.880
 I seem to have opened up a bit of a gate here.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.600
 Pandora's bum.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.040
 On your latest podcast, you talked about the prefix horse, i.e. horse radish.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.720
 If you look at the other examples of the prefix, it normally indicates that the object is both

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:43.080
 larger and or less edible than its better-known item, i.e. horse radish, horse chestnut, bigger

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.160
 and less edible, horse mackerel, which I'm not familiar with.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.820
 No, but it's a bigger and less edible mackerel.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:49.820
 That's me.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.260
 So I was brought up just to read the horse of meaning big and nothing to do with horse.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.260
 Yeah.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.860
 It could be because a horse radish is about the same size as a moolly.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.740
 I don't know if you know what a moolly is.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:00.740
 A moolly?

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:01.740
 Oh my god.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.820
 I thought you might have saved this, Andy.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:05.820
 A moolly?

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:06.820
 Yeah, a moolly.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:07.820
 We talked about this last time.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:08.820
 Yeah, we did.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:09.820
 And no one knew what a moolly was.

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:10.820
 I still don't.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:11.820
 Isn't that interesting?

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.340
 My mind has just rejected that fact.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.660
 I've taken so many facts.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.360
 It's like a daikon.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.880
 Oh, like a daikon?

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.960
 No, like a daikon, not like a gay aikon, like a daikon.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:24.960
 What's that?

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:25.960
 It's like a moolly.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:26.960
 Oh dear.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.000
 How about a horse fly?

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 What's that?

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 Size-wise.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 Bigger?

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 It's huge.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 Oh my god.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 Less edible than a normal fly.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 There we go.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 It works.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.960
 Here's a message from Rachel Weas.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.960
 Hi, Andy.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.580
 It's not as far like Weasel without the L.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:47.580
 All right.

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:53.580
 Is she any relation to Frederick Poo's, who invented the pooter?

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:54.580
 Yeah.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:55.580
 What?

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:56.580
 Will that show have gone out by the time?

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.580
 I hope so.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.460
 For Rachel's sake and ours.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.100
 Thank you, Rachel, for your email.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.500
 I'm listening to episode 54 where you're chatting about names of businesses.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.980
 And Dan asked if authors would write under a pen name to get closer to popular authors.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:08.980
 Yes.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:15.720
 This isn't quite the same, but I worked on a YA novel that came out in 2011 about Lithuanian

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.580
 people being sent to Siberian work camps during the Second World War.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.600
 It's a wonderful novel called Between Shades of Grey.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.560
 Can you guess what it got mixed up for?

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.560
 The other 2011 book.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.560
 That's amazing.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.960
 Imagine getting that through the internet.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.040
 And how much would you read until you realise you got the wrong one?

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.280
 Apparently, there wasn't uptick in sales when the movies came out.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.280
 Wow.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.280
 Yeah, that's great.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.280
 I know.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.280
 There we go.

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.980
 We've got a suggestion from Ivy Kula, who has a suggestion for Club Fish.

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:46.980
 Oh, cool.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:47.980
 Great.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.200
 Ivy says, "I have a suggestion for Club Fish.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.700
 Meet the spouses."

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:52.700
 Okay.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.340
 "I feel like we get little bits and pieces about your partners and I would love to hear

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.740
 what they think about fish and you lot.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.720
 For example, how did Anna's husband feel when she sacrificed him to not make poisoning?

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.940
 What does James' wife think about his random holiday destinations?

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.200
 Is Dan's wife as into supernatural things as he is?

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.600
 Sorry, Andy.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.600
 You're such a private guy.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.600
 We have gleaned very little about you over the years.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.600
 I have a vague--

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.440
 I was too, love.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.000
 I have a vague memory about jokes being made about sandwiches being served at your wedding.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.820
 Perhaps a rebuttal from your wife?

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:28.820
 But you know what?

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.480
 That's because you are a private person.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:35.360
 That's a testament at how good, not only you are, but we are keeping your privacy.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.360
 Keep my secrets.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:42.060
 Andy's private life is so extreme and excessive and not a single piece is appropriate for

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.060
 public consumption.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.060
 You wouldn't think it.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:46.060
 Yeah.

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.060
 I mean, it's corrosive anus.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:52.460
 Obviously, this is an incredibly personal suggestion, so I fully understand if you

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:55.020
 don't do it or if your partners are not okay with it.

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.020
 I read.

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.020
 Thanks for understanding.

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.620
 I have written back and said, "I think it's unlikely that our spouses would--"

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:01.620
 Yeah.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:02.620
 I don't think that.

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:07.160
 They really hate each other, don't they?

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.160
 Yeah.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.160
 That's why.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.160
 We can never do events together because the fur just flies.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.160
 It's awful.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.320
 I think one problem is, obviously, Polina, Bean, Finella, obviously, they're going to

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.320
 be in it.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.400
 But which of Andy's spouses would be in this show?

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:25.520
 Mormon Murray, yeah, which my few bring in.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.320
 Just the thing about sandwiches being served at my wedding, that's not what it was.

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.440
 It's that supposedly I got married in the room where the sandwich was invented.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:32.440
 Yes, that's right.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.500
 Oh, yeah, that's true.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:34.980
 Which you were all there for?

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:35.980
 We were.

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:36.980
 Yeah.

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:37.980
 Yeah.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:38.980
 It's lovely.

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:39.980
 Disappointing spread.

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:43.180
 That's weirdly, that's just what my wife said.

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:48.500
 That's her nickname for you, isn't it?

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:49.500
 Oh, so thank you.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.180
 That's something we won't be doing.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.700
 This is just a great fact, sent in from P.T.

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:55.700
 Yonker.

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:58.020
 I hope I'm saying that right.

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.460
 According to the Guinness Book of World Records, "The man with the world's longest

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:06.680
 tongue has a tongue that is longer than the world's shortest dog is tall."

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:07.680
 How interesting.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:13.680
 So, the tongue is 3.97 inches, again, that must be outside the mouth.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.620
 Yeah, because that's not that impressive, is it?

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:16.620
 It's not that.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:17.620
 It's about 12 centimetres, isn't it?

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:18.620
 Yeah.

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:22.800
 How interesting, because you guys haven't read my suggestions of next week's facts yet.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.800
 Oh.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:27.680
 But one of the ones that I was going to suggest, but I might now delete, is that the longest

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:33.100
 tongue on a woman is the same length as the world's longest cockroach.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:39.300
 Did you find that out while we're searching moth-diving for this week's podcast?

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:42.180
 And it weighs as much as a quarter pound of burger.

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:43.180
 The cockroach?

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:44.180
 No, the tongue.

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:45.180
 The tongue.

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:46.180
 Wow.

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.340
 Actually, same volume as opposed to weighing.

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.180
 People used to eat tongue, didn't they?

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:51.180
 What do they still do?

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.180
 What do they still do?

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:53.180
 Do people still do?

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:58.640
 You two with your jars of tongue in the pantry.

00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.640
 Ridiculous.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:04.600
 James's wedding spread was pretty curious.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:08.600
 I reckon I have eaten tongue in the last five years.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.600
 OK.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.600
 Because you are vegetarian.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.440
 I am now, but I wasn't before Covid.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.440
 Yeah.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.400
 Tongues are sort of a thing where if you said that in front of my mother, she's the kind

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.720
 of person who says, "Oh, for God's sake, people eat tongue all the time.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:26.020
 Every most days I eat tongue when you talk to them."

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:27.180
 But yeah, you would get it.

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:28.180
 I've seen it.

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:29.180
 Yeah, fair enough.

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:30.180
 Yeah.

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:31.180
 Not human.

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:32.180
 Not human.

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:33.180
 No.

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:34.180
 Not human.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:35.180
 Of course.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:36.180
 Yeah.

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:37.180
 Yeah.

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:38.180
 Yeah.

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:39.180
 Big bovine tongue.

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:40.180
 Oh, yes.

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:41.180
 Lovely.

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:47.620
 If you froze it, it could be like a reverse ice cream where it licks you.

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:51.160
 You still get the taste.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:52.160
 So, yeah, I see.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:57.680
 Well, I think that's the point about this guy with the dog, is that the guy could lick.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:02.000
 He could lick the dog up and down without moving his tongue at all.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 What a useful skill.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.600
 I don't think that doesn't count as licking, if you just press your tongue against something.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:09.600
 You haven't licked it.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.600
 Does that not count as licking?

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:11.600
 She don't think so.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.600
 I am very interested.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:18.820
 I have an expert to bring in.

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:21.100
 I did not lick that person.

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:23.940
 I just pressed my tongue against them.

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:26.660
 I'll support Andy to the hilt here.

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:29.220
 A tongue press is completely different.

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.100
 It's very different.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:32.100
 Great.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:33.100
 Oh.

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:37.500
 Yeah, because in that case, the dog is doing almost like a catch having a scratching pole.

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:42.480
 The tongue is erect up and it would be the dog doing.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.480
 That's right.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.480
 The scratching.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.480
 Yeah.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.900
 I think it actually would count as a lick if the dog started moving up and down, grinding

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:48.900
 against the tongue.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:49.900
 You're still not moving your tongue.

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:53.220
 Yeah, but, again, in court, you can't blame the dog.

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:56.980
 You can't say, "Oh, no, the dog was rubbing against my tongue."

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:58.460
 It's absolutely fine.

00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:00.780
 I left my tongue there.

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:01.780
 Yeah.

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:03.620
 There's a complicated case, I think.

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:04.620
 It's very nuanced.

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:07.140
 We'll keep you posted.

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:11.660
 Christian Dainton writes, "You mentioned in the latest podcast that 1984 is an easy book

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:15.280
 to lie about having read, as most people know the important points.

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:21.920
 In my English GCSE, we studied the old man in the sea, which people wrongly call a masterpiece.

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:26.500
 The other class were reading 1984, and during the mock exam, I answered the questions on

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:32.160
 1984, as I thought I had better answers for it, despite not having read it at all."

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:33.160
 That's brilliant.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.160
 Brilliant.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.160
 How did they do?

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.880
 Please say they've attached the grade they got, because it's quite important.

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:45.220
 Unfortunately, I failed that exam, and my life has really gone to shit ever since.

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:46.220
 That's so funny.

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:49.380
 I wrote back and asked Christian, "Did you pass?"

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:51.900
 And Christian wrote back and said, "I think so."

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:52.900
 Oh, yeah.

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:53.900
 So, maybe.

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:54.900
 There's only a mock.

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:55.900
 Yeah, that's all the mock.

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:56.900
 The mock doesn't matter.

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:57.900
 What's a mock?

00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:58.900
 Like, fake test?

00:11:58.900 --> 00:11:59.900
 It's a practice.

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:00.900
 Get you ready.

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:01.900
 Here's another suggestion, actually.

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:07.260
 We're going to need to come up with a section name for suggestions of format tweaks or new

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:08.260
 formats.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:09.260
 For this show.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.200
 Yeah, yeah, for bonus content.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:12.200
 Yeah.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.400
 Thanks, but no thanks.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.400
 Okay.

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:21.040
 I think that'll save the reply to everything.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:29.160
 Weirdly, Andy's wife's response when she was asked, "Do you take this man?"

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.160
 Tunk.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.160
 Go on.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.160
 What's the idea?

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:38.240
 Martin Hill writes, "It would be really amazing if you guys did a club fish book club."

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.880
 I'm sure there will be a funny name or pun to be made there.

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:45.260
 "It will be really good to have a book set by yourselves alongside suggestions from club

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:46.820
 fish members, guests, and other elves.

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:49.340
 And it would be good for those of us that enjoy reading but don't find as much time

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:50.340
 as we would like."

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:51.340
 It's a nice idea.

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:52.340
 Mmm.

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:53.340
 It's a nice idea.

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:58.660
 I'm part of so many book clubs now that I end up, I've got book fatigue.

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:00.340
 Which club clubs would you recommend?

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:02.700
 Oh, as in, though, like, personal book clubs.

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:03.700
 Oh.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:04.700
 It's just with me.

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:06.380
 Well, you and I used to be in the same book club.

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:07.380
 Yeah, that's right.

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:11.980
 Yeah, you've taken it over, and it didn't invite us back in.

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:15.620
 Oh, you're still in that one, Andy, that you told me about and how some people were dragging

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:18.460
 down the general standard.

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:21.680
 I just think some books that are suggested are not suitable, not everyone wants to read

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.680
 about Bigfoot every month.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:29.400
 Maybe they need to open up their mind a bit.

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:30.400
 Recommend Richard Herring's book club.

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:31.400
 Oh, yeah, that's a great one.

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:32.400
 That's a great personality.

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.400
 Shall we do a book club where we owe a book club club?

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.680
 That's quite good, actually, yes.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:41.680
 Well, you can only recommend a book club, because you can only be in a book club if

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:43.460
 you're invited to be in a book club, right?

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:47.940
 Yes, but the four of us could talk about The Old Man and the Sea, which we probably shouldn't

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:52.340
 on the first round of it, and then, you know, listeners could read along and then see what

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:53.340
 we thought, you know.

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:56.500
 Yeah, so we would announce here, in two months' time, we're going to be talking about this

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:57.500
 book on here.

00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:58.500
 Yeah.

00:13:58.500 --> 00:13:59.500
 I think that's a whole new show.

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:00.500
 Yeah.

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.300
 I think that's a whole extra podcast, which would be a great one to do, but I think we've

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:03.300
 got quite different tastes as well.

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:04.300
 Do we all have to read the book?

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:05.300
 That's the thing.

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:06.300
 Yeah.

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:10.500
 We might all, we could all read separate books and then talk across purposes.

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:11.500
 I would like that.

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:12.500
 Yeah.

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:13.500
 That is a fun idea.

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:14.500
 Yeah.

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:15.500
 Thanks, but no thanks.

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:18.260
 If you have any other ideas, do send them in.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:19.260
 Yeah.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:20.260
 Please.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:22.820
 And we will reject them.

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:26.900
 But imagine if one makes it through, you know we're going to reject it.

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:28.620
 Imagine, you know, it's going to be so good.

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:29.620
 Yeah, that's true.

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:31.540
 That's a really good point.

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:32.540
 Here's one from Philip White.

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:33.540
 I like this one.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:38.620
 So, in episode 508, you mentioned wire manufacturers, realizing they could use water instead of

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:40.380
 urine and it will work just as well.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:45.160
 They use urine for ages and ages, and then someone asked if this was a recent discovery,

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:50.660
 because obviously it would only be the pre-enlightenment rubes who would use some esoteric beer/piss concoction

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:53.340
 in an industrial process before trying water.

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:56.940
 Well, let me introduce you to hydraulic fracking.

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:57.940
 Okay.

00:14:57.940 --> 00:14:58.940
 Please do.

00:14:58.940 --> 00:14:59.940
 Gosh.

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:02.700
 So fracking is where you're trying to get natural gas out of the ground, deep below layers of

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:05.060
 rock, and you pump in water, right?

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:06.060
 So in trying to...

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:08.660
 It's the communities where they probably don't want you to do it.

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:09.980
 Yeah, they're earthquakes and it all...

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:10.980
 Yeah, yeah.

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:11.980
 It's great.

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:12.980
 We don't need to take a position!

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:13.980
 No, no, no.

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:14.980
 You're right.

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:15.980
 We're neutral on fracking.

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:16.980
 Yeah, sure.

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:17.980
 If you want to sponsor us, fracking US.

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:18.980
 Drillbabydrill@fish.com.

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:19.980
 Yeah.

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:25.620
 In trying to extract natural gas from wells, oil companies used especially formulated gel

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:29.540
 to essentially flush the gas out of cracked rock well into the 1990s.

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:33.780
 It wasn't until cost-cutting measures tried diluting that expensive gel with water, then

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:38.780
 with even more water and less gel, and getting not only similar results but better output

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:40.920
 did they realise they could just use water.

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:41.920
 No!

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:45.540
 It revolutionised the natural gas industry overnight, cutting the cost per well by nearly

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:46.540
 half.

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:47.540
 Wow.

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:48.540
 That's an amazing fact.

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:49.540
 It's a great fact.

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:50.540
 Wow.

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:51.540
 But it's pumping all that gel underground.

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:52.540
 That's crazy.

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:53.540
 Oh my God.

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:54.540
 Sort of a jelly layer.

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:55.540
 Yes.

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:59.020
 So now a jelly layer then, under the Earth's crust, left over.

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:00.020
 That's so funny.

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:03.020
 All the north of England.

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:04.020
 Mmmm.

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:05.020
 Your neck of the woods, wasn't it?

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:06.020
 Got fracked.

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:08.820
 Some areas close to where I used to live, yeah.

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:14.860
 But it's all fine, isn't it?

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:17.860
 Sander Lutus writes.

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:19.860
 The ancient Roman orator.

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:25.100
 That's right.

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:28.100
 You were talking about whether the police ever used bum prints.

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:29.100
 They do.

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:30.100
 Oh.

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:33.940
 I was burgled back in 2017, and as the burglar kicked in one of the locked doors, they fell

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:37.820
 backwards into the wall directly behind them and caved in the plaster, leaving a big bum

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:38.820
 print.

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:39.820
 Amazing.

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:40.820
 And had no trousers on.

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:47.700
 When CSI came round, they took a print of the dirty shoe pattern on the door, and they

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:52.520
 also measured the bum hole left in the wall.

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:54.060
 The bum hole.

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:55.060
 Yep.

00:16:55.060 --> 00:17:00.060
 They never found any suspects to measure bums against, but the police did collect the bum

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:01.740
 print for that eventuality.

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:05.000
 I hope they would make a mold of it, so when you were called in to be interrogated, the

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 seat you sit into.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:13.020
 If you're innocent, you just sort of move it around a little bit, you can't get comfortable.

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:14.020
 You can go.

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:15.020
 You can go.

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:18.220
 But when you get up to leave, the chair goes to you.

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:21.660
 This is the Cinderella story that I want to see.

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:22.660
 Oh, dear.

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:28.100
 And the nice thing about that email is Sander's surname is Lootus, and it's a story about

00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:29.100
 Sander being burgled.

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:31.060
 Yeah, you shouldn't have called yourself that, should you?

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:39.460
 If you didn't want people to come and bum-burgle you, the bum-burgler.

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:40.620
 Here's something from Mark Vendt.

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:42.100
 Oh, that's my buddy.

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:43.100
 Really?

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:44.100
 Yeah.

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:45.100
 Yeah.

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:46.100
 Actually, he signs off as dance friend Mark.

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:47.100
 There we go.

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:48.100
 That makes a lot of sense.

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:49.100
 No, that's great.

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:50.100
 That's good corroboration there.

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:55.140
 There's a story about Henry Ford where he was showing a visit around his company, and

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.820
 the supervising engineer explained the assembly line.

00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:02.420
 Ford interrupted to say there are 4,197 parts in a motor car.

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:06.060
 The impressed visitor asked the engineer if that was correct, and he replied, "I'm sure

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:07.060
 I don't know.

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:10.740
 I can't think of a more useless piece of information."

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:13.140
 Clearly that guy wasn't to know such a thing as a fish fan.

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:16.140
 What's been your most poorly received fact?

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:18.780
 That's a good question.

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:19.780
 Yeah, yeah.

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:21.260
 It's like a blind date question.

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:26.140
 Well chum.

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:33.500
 I think the fact that we're going to get together will be received very well, like the reception

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:35.860
 at our wedding when we get married.

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:41.060
 Well, we'll be serving tongue.

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:42.060
 I don't know what...

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:44.060
 I can't think of an example.

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:45.060
 I'm sure it happens.

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:48.020
 I can't think of loads, but you guys...

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:53.820
 Often, because we have a document of our facts that we're pitching to each other, and some

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:57.340
 of us, James puts in all new facts every time, he puts in four or five new facts, and we

00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:01.460
 pick one, and then James insists on deleting the rest, but I would say the other three

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:02.460
 of us...

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:04.300
 No, sorry, I alternate my facts every other week.

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:05.300
 Okay, so...

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:06.300
 They're never helpful in two weeks.

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:11.860
 Okay, so whereas Dan and I think this is fair, we have some facts that have been in there

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:13.540
 for many, many months.

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:14.540
 And we just think...

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:15.540
 Because we believe in them.

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:19.740
 It's interesting, but the others, one day, having seen this fact nine times before, will

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:21.700
 come to it thinking, "You know, that is amazing."

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:26.380
 And you know, eventually you will delete them, but then they do come back like a bad penny.

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:28.100
 I sort of thought you wouldn't notice that.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.100
 But we've definitely had a few.

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:31.980
 We've all had a few headline facts over the years where the other ones would have felt

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:32.980
 "Oh, that's a bit crap."

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:35.740
 And I think mine, it must have just been a bad week of other facts for me.

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:40.900
 I remember loving the fact that the person who invented Stroganov was the grandfather

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:42.740
 of the person who invented human chess.

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:43.740
 Yeah, I think that's good.

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:45.700
 Mine, I think it might have been great grandfather.

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:48.220
 When you say human chess, what do you mean actual human?

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:51.060
 Well, you can go back and listen to the episode that you were in.

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:52.780
 Don't say that's great, wouldn't bother.

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:56.300
 I've got one that I put in there that got nothing from you guys, and I still think is

00:19:56.300 --> 00:20:00.540
 incredible, which is that there was, I don't remember the details now because it's gone,

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:06.820
 but basically there's one example only ever of a military plane flying as high as possible

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:13.020
 to the edge of space, spotting and honing in on a satellite in space and shooting it,

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:14.020
 blowing it up.

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:18.940
 It's the only Earth to space missile hit and kill that we've ever had.

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:19.940
 I don't remember this one.

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:20.940
 I think that's for the number.

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:21.940
 Yeah, I remember that one.

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:22.940
 That sounds good.

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:23.940
 You should pop it in the dog.

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:24.940
 Please God, no.

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:25.940
 That's amazing though.

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:26.940
 That's incredible.

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:27.940
 Yeah.

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:30.180
 He shot a satellite out in space from Earth.

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:31.180
 That's incredible.

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:32.180
 In a plane.

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:35.820
 I think I've just remembered my poorly received fact about, well, there you go.

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:36.820
 Yeah, no.

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:39.140
 Mine was about the time of submarine got into a fight with a train.

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:41.780
 Yours are often technical.

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:46.620
 We take them down on like, oh, so it wasn't like it was a submarine in the ocean.

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:50.500
 And then the train was meeting it on like the border of the ocean and land.

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:51.900
 Yours was like, it was on the back of a truck.

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:52.900
 I agree, Andy.

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:57.340
 You'll sometimes be creative with your wording and we'll get incredibly excited.

00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:02.260
 It's like a primped up CV and then you'll say, so what was this conference you organized

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:04.660
 and it'll be a game of Dungeons and Dragons or something.

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:07.980
 Okay, so, Mark, I think you've got your answer, so let's.

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:08.980
 Wow.

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:12.540
 Wow, that's opened up a few old wounds, hasn't it?

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:13.540
 Yeah.

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:16.860
 I just remember we got in a terrible row with each other.

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:20.420
 Me against three of you with about a half an hour to go before a show and it was in New

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:21.420
 York City.

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:22.420
 It was so exciting.

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:23.420
 Really?

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:24.420
 And it's about the definition of a shrimp.

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:25.420
 And it was so.

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:30.180
 And I just remember being almost blind with rage because my fact was being corrected with

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:31.180
 not long to go.

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:33.780
 And I think you guys are pretty annoyed that I've presented a fact about a dubious definition

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:34.780
 of a shrimp.

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:35.780
 With not long to go.

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:36.780
 Oh, yeah.

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:37.780
 I remember that.

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:38.780
 It was about the prawn cocktail or shrimp.

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:41.580
 It was about whether prawn cocktail was shrimp cocktail or something.

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:42.580
 Yeah.

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:46.260
 And it was, honestly, it was really tense.

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:47.260
 Wow.

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:48.260
 Yeah.

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:49.260
 Let's not go back there.

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:50.260
 It's too painful for me to remember.

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:52.380
 We've not had many moments like that, but not many.

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:53.380
 That sounds like that's something.

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:58.620
 What does happen quite often is that we all choose our facts and then someone about three

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:03.200
 days later will send a message and I'm going, yeah, I've researched that and it is true

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:04.200
 at all.

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.200
 That's definitely not true.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.200
 No.

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.660
 It will be very diplomatic though.

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:11.460
 So try and notice it because what we'll do is then we'll come up with another fact that's

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:12.460
 in the same subject.

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:14.420
 So we're not wasting any research.

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:15.660
 So see if you can spot those.

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:17.780
 I'd be curious because there's a lot of people doing data at the moment.

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:18.780
 I have a feeling.

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:22.900
 This is not a slam on you, Andy, but I have a feeling like when we have those, when we

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:25.500
 have those moments, we do sometimes change the fact.

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:29.260
 But I think sometimes with your ones, we still do the fact and then there's an immediate

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:31.260
 qualifier after it.

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:33.300
 And that's not a slam because...

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:37.080
 Because it's just a way of, it's just a, we acknowledge it.

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:39.840
 So it's not like it's, you know, it's not bad.

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:41.760
 Yeah, it didn't feel a million miles from slam.

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:42.760
 Did you feel a slam?

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:43.760
 Ah.

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:44.760
 I felt patted.

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:45.760
 Didn't mean it.

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:46.760
 It's not a slam.

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:47.760
 A flick, I think, at least.

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:48.760
 I've been licked.

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:51.560
 It's not a lick, but your tongue was pressed against me.

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:52.560
 Hold on.

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:53.560
 Hold on.

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:54.560
 Hold on.

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.480
 Here's, this is really exciting.

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:57.480
 We've had an expert write in.

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:58.480
 Okay, cool.

00:22:58.480 --> 00:22:59.480
 Dr. Richard Osborne.

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:00.480
 Cool.

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:04.300
 I'm very excited to find the top item on the latest episode of Fish related to Australian

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:05.300
 magpies.

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:06.300
 Oh yeah.

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:07.300
 Now that was with Mel Bracewells, I think.

00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:08.300
 Maybe you were right.

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:09.300
 Okay.

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:11.820
 But I've seen them and they look not like magpies.

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:17.820
 Well, Richard Osborne, Dr. Richard Osborne writes, "My joy was somewhat soured when

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:23.340
 I heard that despite being the highly regarded inventor of the supremely effective party

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:36.080
 popper anti-magpie helmet, I was described as looking like an idiot."

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:39.520
 I'd want to be clear now.

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:44.720
 If I'd been on that show, I'd certainly not have happened.

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:45.720
 Why did he look like an idiot?

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:46.720
 I'm really sorry.

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:51.480
 That was me who said that he looked like an idiot.

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:55.820
 You know what, I can't even, because I can't imagine things, I couldn't remember what

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:56.820
 he looked like at all.

00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:58.940
 So I was just assuming that he looked like an idiot.

00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:02.860
 Also, there was one pipe you blew into and it blew out all the poppers at the same time.

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:03.860
 Yeah.

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:04.860
 So they're not party poppers, Anna, just to explain.

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:07.900
 They're not the ones that you pull and they go pop, they're more like the ones that you

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:09.400
 blow and they go up.

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:10.400
 Yeah.

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:11.400
 And they go outwards like the top.

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:12.400
 Oh, like a party whistle.

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:13.400
 Yeah.

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.900
 And he's got a bike helmet covered in these.

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:15.900
 That's amazing.

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:16.900
 And he blows.

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:17.900
 They can all blow out.

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:18.900
 Yeah.

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:19.900
 That's so cool.

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:23.520
 And if Anna was here, then she would have said that you look so cool.

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:28.400
 He says, "I'm sure you will enjoy reviewing the attached images which display this magnificent

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:30.060
 device in greater detail.

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:34.640
 In terms of my contributions to medical science as a senior oncologist for 30 years, I regard

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:37.080
 my innovation as the pinnacle of my whole career."

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:38.580
 So fair play.

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:39.580
 Brilliant.

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:43.960
 So picture him, you know, bike riding, his hand on, he's listening to his favorite podcast.

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:46.200
 That's coming down from all angles.

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:52.020
 He gets a mention.

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:54.780
 He's paused it.

00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:58.380
 Kids, kids, daddy's on his favorite podcast.

00:24:58.380 --> 00:24:59.860
 And they all called me an idiot.

00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:03.020
 Well, let's see what the fish people think.

00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:06.740
 Wait, stop the surgery, stop the surgery.

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:11.020
 I'm going to listen to this.

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:16.180
 He goes on, "I must also point out a factual error," just says, "There is crystal clear

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:20.400
 evidence that applying googly eyes to the back of a helmet does not prevent magpies from

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:21.400
 it."

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:22.400
 Oh, interesting.

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.400
 That is interesting.

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:27.920
 So we said, I said, I believe it was me, said that sometimes cyclists will wear sunglasses

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:31.360
 backwards on their head so that it looks like their eyes are there, which will put off

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:32.360
 magpies.

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:33.360
 Maybe sunglasses work.

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:34.360
 It's not clear.

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:35.360
 Okay.

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.360
 No, they don't.

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:37.360
 But googly eyes.

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:38.360
 Okay.

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:39.360
 I don't understand.

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:40.360
 Are they still on the back of your head?

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:41.360
 They'd fall off.

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:42.360
 Oh, you can do that.

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:43.360
 Do it now.

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:44.360
 You're wearing glasses.

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:45.360
 It's still there.

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:46.360
 Oh, yeah.

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:49.040
 Well, Dan, are you looking at me or going away from me?

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.040
 I can hardly tell.

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:56.360
 I can think I can say what he's saying, you look like an idiot.

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:57.360
 Lovely.

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.360
 All right.

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:00.360
 That's it.

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:01.360
 Bye.

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:02.360
 Beauty.

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:16.960
 That was great fun for us and we hope for you to the he's not done yet and it just got

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:17.960
 up to leave.

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:18.960
 Yeah.

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:19.960
 It felt like you were done.

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:20.960
 It actually did.

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:21.960
 I said bye.

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:22.960
 Then I do the outro though.

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:23.960
 You know, that's how we.

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:24.960
 Sorry.

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:25.960
 James has been on his phone.

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:26.960
 James is doing day trading on his phone.

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:39.560
 I was looking for some messages that people had sent me, but I couldn't find any.

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:44.320
 So you were just just waiting in your inbox hoping for someone like, shall I read one?

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:45.320
 Yeah.

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:46.320
 Yeah.

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.400
 So Kaz sent me a message on Instagram.

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:49.960
 No such thing as James Harkin.

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:50.960
 Hi, James.

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:51.960
 You are my favorite fish.

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:52.960
 Saut off me.

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:53.960
 That's a fake.

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:54.960
 That's right here.

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:55.960
 That's right here.

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:57.860
 I have an interesting fact.

00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:01.760
 If you want to find out where someone originates from within Japan, you can spray them with

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:04.760
 a water gun.

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:09.520
 Apparently there was a Japanese TV show and what they did was they went around the country

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:13.160
 splashing people with a water gun and they all said different things depending on where

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.560
 in Japan they're from.

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:19.080
 So if you're from Bolton and someone did it, you're like, oh, bugger off.

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:22.120
 Or as if they're from London, you'd be like, oh, Saut off.

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:23.120
 Nice.

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:24.120
 That's right.

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:25.120
 Like that.

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:28.800
 Hey, since you're in your messages, there was an email that I felt really bad we didn't

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:32.760
 read out because it was so relevant to the podcast we just recorded and we all got an

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:37.080
 email from our great friend, Jason Haisley, who's lovely, and I thought that was such

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:41.140
 a good fact he sent us because he'd just been randomly doing a company's house search.

00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:42.140
 Oh, yes.

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:43.400
 And he found this amazing email.

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:44.400
 Here we go.

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:45.400
 James has got it.

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:49.800
 So basically he randomly found on company's house that there's a company called My Neighbors

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:54.600
 possess an enormous superiority complex yet ironically they're both emotionally and intellectually

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:57.520
 very, very limited.

00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:02.280
 I don't think Jason sent me that email.

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.280
 Ouch.

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:04.280
 Is that about you?

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:10.320
 No, no, from Jason Haisley to Daniel Schreiber, Anna Tyshinski, James, oh yeah, James Harkin.

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:13.000
 Just the three of us.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.160
 Well, well, well.

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:16.160
 Sent it from Australia.

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:17.160
 All that way.

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:24.320
 Maybe there was only time to send it to three of you or the cost of sending to four recipients

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:26.160
 goes hugely up from three.

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:27.160
 Wow.

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:28.160
 Wow.

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:29.160
 Wow.

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:31.160
 Well, this is all good.

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:35.040
 I didn't mean to raise such a controversial issue so late in the day.

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.680
 What the heck?

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:38.760
 I didn't do that episode.

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:39.760
 You didn't do that episode.

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:40.760
 That's why.

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:41.760
 That's why.

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:42.760
 It doesn't make it hurt any less.

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:44.680
 It does not make it hurt less.

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:49.080
 As someone who didn't do that episode, you wouldn't be interested in an email from Jason.

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:50.080
 I would have thought.

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:51.080
 Absolutely not.

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:52.080
 Exactly.

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:53.080
 Right.

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:55.520
 Well, that's the tears well into Andy's eyeballs.

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:57.960
 How about a quick rounding off?

00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:58.960
 Bye.

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:11.720
 Bye everybody, it's podcast at qi.com if you want to send us content, which we will sift

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:14.240
 and winnow and then read out.

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:15.240
 So please do that.

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.240
 Thank you.

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:17.720
 Sorry, I feel like I've gone a bit serious.

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:19.220
 We've had a really fun time.

00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:20.720
 It's been great.

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:24.240
 It's been so much fun.

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:33.200
 So you know, stay careful and keep your back up and we'll see you next time.

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:34.200
 You'll hear us next time.

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:34.200
 Bye.

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:34.560
 Bye.

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:35.560
 Bye.

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:36.560
 Bye.

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:37.560
 Bye.

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:37.560
 Bye.

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:40.140
 (upbeat music)

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:42.720
 (upbeat music)
