 [music]

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,500
 Hi!

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,000
 No, it wasn't a good hi. I'm going to do it again.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 Mm-hmm.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Hi, friends.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 Hi!

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 Hi, everybody.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 Welcome back to Drop As A Line.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Six out of ten.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 [laughter]

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 Creepy laughter.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 That's two out of ten.

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 Yeah, yeah, you've knocked off a few points there.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Hi, everybody. Welcome back to Drop As A Line.

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 The audience feedback, um, segment of...

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 It's been a while.

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 It's been ages.

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Yeah.

19
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Two months.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 How's it?

21
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Yonks.

22
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Ah, we must have loads of feedback.

23
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Lots, actually.

24
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 It's some positive.

25
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Well, let's stick with those.

26
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 [laughter]

27
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Okay, well, it's going to be a short show today.

28
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 [laughter]

29
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 No, there's been some positive stuff.

30
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Some vulgar abuse, I'd say.

31
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Okay.

32
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 A lot of stuff in the middle.

33
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 Some great bonus info.

34
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 But we might do an audience fact special again soon.

35
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 Oh, yes.

36
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 On main feed.

37
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 For the, um, what are we calling the main listeners?

38
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Not you lovely club fish listeners.

39
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 The plebs.

40
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 The boy ploy.

41
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 The paupers.

42
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Okay.

43
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 The lovely, lovely people.

44
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Yeah.

45
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 The cheapskates.

46
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 The freeloaders.

47
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 There we go.

48
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 There we go.

49
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 So, but there are some great stuff for you.

50
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Our premium gold club members.

51
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 So, um...

52
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 The dupes.

53
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 The dupes.

54
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 [laughter]

55
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 Cheapskates on the dupes.

56
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Right.

57
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 [laughter]

58
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 Ah.

59
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,500
 Well, let's make that three pounds a month work for you right now as we read out our first

60
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,000
 email from Chuck Blower.

61
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 [laughter]

62
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Thank you, Chuck.

63
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 It's good to be back.

64
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 It's great.

65
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 I'm serious.

66
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 I'm serious.

67
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,500
 Um, so he's, uh, he says some nice words and then he says, "I'm just finishing your last

68
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,440
 podcast that talks about wasabi and horseradish.

69
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:55,000
 Not quite sure about this fact because I haven't actually had horseradish roots stuck up my

70
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 tongue.

71
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,720
 But to my knowledge, and I have made horseradish sauce from scratch, you don't get the hot

72
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:04,000
 effect of the root till it's grated, the finer the grated, the more the heat."

73
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,600
 Um, so with all that said, I do not believe the root up of the wazoo would be as torturous

74
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,600
 as you might think.

75
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,000
 I don't remember what this fact is.

76
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 Well, I do, yeah.

77
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,500
 We said that, and we also said it wouldn't hurt the wazoo because it's grated.

78
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:21,300
 Well, possibly, yeah, I think I suggested that it might, um, because it's used to relieve

79
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:29,000
 constipation in horses, possibly a horseradish up the bum could, could give you some of the

80
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 spiciness.

81
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,620
 But honestly, I think Chuck probably hasn't quite, you know, he's saying he thinks that.

82
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:40,160
 He gives a little bit of evidence, but it's circumstantial at best.

83
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,160
 We need more, we need more, Chuck.

84
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,160
 I'm sorry.

85
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,160
 That's not a scientist writing, is it?

86
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,600
 Did you only read the sign because of his name?

87
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,600
 No.

88
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,760
 Now let's go to Phil Slack.

89
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:54,820
 I imagine it could depend on how corrosive your anal passage was, couldn't it?

90
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,820
 Corrosive.

91
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,820
 Well, because it's...

92
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:57,820
 Corrosive.

93
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:01,980
 Yeah, so if you've got one that sort of does the grating as it goes up.

94
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,380
 Oh, so how rough it is.

95
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,380
 How rough it is, yeah.

96
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,380
 How rough it is, yeah.

97
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,380
 I see.

98
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,380
 Yeah.

99
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,380
 Yes.

100
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,380
 Well, that's, um, wow.

101
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,380
 Horrible.

102
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,380
 Is that a medical thing?

103
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,380
 I'm just trying to justify James's point here.

104
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,380
 Great.

105
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,380
 Great point.

106
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,380
 Thank you.

107
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,380
 There we go.

108
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:20,040
 That's from Phil Slack and it's on the same subject about horse radish.

109
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,040
 Okay.

110
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,040
 So Phil writes...

111
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,880
 I seem to have opened up a bit of a gate here.

112
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,600
 Pandora's bum.

113
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,040
 On your latest podcast, you talked about the prefix horse, i.e. horse radish.

114
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,720
 If you look at the other examples of the prefix, it normally indicates that the object is both

115
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:43,080
 larger and or less edible than its better-known item, i.e. horse radish, horse chestnut, bigger

116
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,160
 and less edible, horse mackerel, which I'm not familiar with.

117
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,820
 No, but it's a bigger and less edible mackerel.

118
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:49,820
 That's me.

119
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:53,260
 So I was brought up just to read the horse of meaning big and nothing to do with horse.

120
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,260
 Yeah.

121
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,860
 It could be because a horse radish is about the same size as a moolly.

122
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,740
 I don't know if you know what a moolly is.

123
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,740
 A moolly?

124
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,740
 Oh my god.

125
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:04,820
 I thought you might have saved this, Andy.

126
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:05,820
 A moolly?

127
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,820
 Yeah, a moolly.

128
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,820
 We talked about this last time.

129
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:08,820
 Yeah, we did.

130
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,820
 And no one knew what a moolly was.

131
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,820
 I still don't.

132
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,820
 Isn't that interesting?

133
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,340
 My mind has just rejected that fact.

134
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,660
 I've taken so many facts.

135
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,360
 It's like a daikon.

136
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,880
 Oh, like a daikon?

137
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,960
 No, like a daikon, not like a gay aikon, like a daikon.

138
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,960
 What's that?

139
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,960
 It's like a moolly.

140
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,960
 Oh dear.

141
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,000
 How about a horse fly?

142
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 What's that?

143
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 Size-wise.

144
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Bigger?

145
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 It's huge.

146
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 Oh my god.

147
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 Less edible than a normal fly.

148
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 There we go.

149
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 It works.

150
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,960
 Here's a message from Rachel Weas.

151
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,960
 Hi, Andy.

152
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,580
 It's not as far like Weasel without the L.

153
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,580
 All right.

154
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:53,580
 Is she any relation to Frederick Poo's, who invented the pooter?

155
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,580
 Yeah.

156
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,580
 What?

157
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,580
 Will that show have gone out by the time?

158
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,580
 I hope so.

159
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,460
 For Rachel's sake and ours.

160
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,100
 Thank you, Rachel, for your email.

161
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,500
 I'm listening to episode 54 where you're chatting about names of businesses.

162
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,980
 And Dan asked if authors would write under a pen name to get closer to popular authors.

163
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:08,980
 Yes.

164
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:15,720
 This isn't quite the same, but I worked on a YA novel that came out in 2011 about Lithuanian

165
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,580
 people being sent to Siberian work camps during the Second World War.

166
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,600
 It's a wonderful novel called Between Shades of Grey.

167
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,560
 Can you guess what it got mixed up for?

168
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,560
 The other 2011 book.

169
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,560
 That's amazing.

170
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,960
 Imagine getting that through the internet.

171
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,040
 And how much would you read until you realise you got the wrong one?

172
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,280
 Apparently, there wasn't uptick in sales when the movies came out.

173
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,280
 Wow.

174
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,280
 Yeah, that's great.

175
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,280
 I know.

176
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,280
 There we go.

177
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,980
 We've got a suggestion from Ivy Kula, who has a suggestion for Club Fish.

178
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:46,980
 Oh, cool.

179
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:47,980
 Great.

180
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,200
 Ivy says, "I have a suggestion for Club Fish.

181
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,700
 Meet the spouses."

182
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,700
 Okay.

183
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,340
 "I feel like we get little bits and pieces about your partners and I would love to hear

184
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,740
 what they think about fish and you lot.

185
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:03,720
 For example, how did Anna's husband feel when she sacrificed him to not make poisoning?

186
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,940
 What does James' wife think about his random holiday destinations?

187
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,200
 Is Dan's wife as into supernatural things as he is?

188
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,600
 Sorry, Andy.

189
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,600
 You're such a private guy.

190
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,600
 We have gleaned very little about you over the years.

191
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,600
 I have a vague--

192
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,440
 I was too, love.

193
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,000
 I have a vague memory about jokes being made about sandwiches being served at your wedding.

194
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,820
 Perhaps a rebuttal from your wife?

195
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,820
 But you know what?

196
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,480
 That's because you are a private person.

197
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:35,360
 That's a testament at how good, not only you are, but we are keeping your privacy.

198
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,360
 Keep my secrets.

199
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:42,060
 Andy's private life is so extreme and excessive and not a single piece is appropriate for

200
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,060
 public consumption.

201
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,060
 You wouldn't think it.

202
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,060
 Yeah.

203
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,060
 I mean, it's corrosive anus.

204
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:52,460
 Obviously, this is an incredibly personal suggestion, so I fully understand if you

205
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:55,020
 don't do it or if your partners are not okay with it.

206
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,020
 I read.

207
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,020
 Thanks for understanding.

208
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,620
 I have written back and said, "I think it's unlikely that our spouses would--"

209
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,620
 Yeah.

210
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,620
 I don't think that.

211
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:07,160
 They really hate each other, don't they?

212
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,160
 Yeah.

213
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,160
 That's why.

214
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,160
 We can never do events together because the fur just flies.

215
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,160
 It's awful.

216
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,320
 I think one problem is, obviously, Polina, Bean, Finella, obviously, they're going to

217
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,320
 be in it.

218
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,400
 But which of Andy's spouses would be in this show?

219
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:25,520
 Mormon Murray, yeah, which my few bring in.

220
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,320
 Just the thing about sandwiches being served at my wedding, that's not what it was.

221
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,440
 It's that supposedly I got married in the room where the sandwich was invented.

222
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,440
 Yes, that's right.

223
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,500
 Oh, yeah, that's true.

224
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,980
 Which you were all there for?

225
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:35,980
 We were.

226
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:36,980
 Yeah.

227
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:37,980
 Yeah.

228
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:38,980
 It's lovely.

229
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:39,980
 Disappointing spread.

230
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:43,180
 That's weirdly, that's just what my wife said.

231
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:48,500
 That's her nickname for you, isn't it?

232
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,500
 Oh, so thank you.

233
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,180
 That's something we won't be doing.

234
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,700
 This is just a great fact, sent in from P.T.

235
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,700
 Yonker.

236
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,020
 I hope I'm saying that right.

237
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,460
 According to the Guinness Book of World Records, "The man with the world's longest

238
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:06,680
 tongue has a tongue that is longer than the world's shortest dog is tall."

239
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,680
 How interesting.

240
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,680
 So, the tongue is 3.97 inches, again, that must be outside the mouth.

241
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,620
 Yeah, because that's not that impressive, is it?

242
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,620
 It's not that.

243
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,620
 It's about 12 centimetres, isn't it?

244
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,620
 Yeah.

245
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:22,800
 How interesting, because you guys haven't read my suggestions of next week's facts yet.

246
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,800
 Oh.

247
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,680
 But one of the ones that I was going to suggest, but I might now delete, is that the longest

248
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,100
 tongue on a woman is the same length as the world's longest cockroach.

249
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:39,300
 Did you find that out while we're searching moth-diving for this week's podcast?

250
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,180
 And it weighs as much as a quarter pound of burger.

251
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,180
 The cockroach?

252
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,180
 No, the tongue.

253
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,180
 The tongue.

254
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,180
 Wow.

255
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,340
 Actually, same volume as opposed to weighing.

256
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,180
 People used to eat tongue, didn't they?

257
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,180
 What do they still do?

258
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,180
 What do they still do?

259
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,180
 Do people still do?

260
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:58,640
 You two with your jars of tongue in the pantry.

261
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,640
 Ridiculous.

262
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,600
 James's wedding spread was pretty curious.

263
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,600
 I reckon I have eaten tongue in the last five years.

264
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,600
 OK.

265
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,600
 Because you are vegetarian.

266
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,440
 I am now, but I wasn't before Covid.

267
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,440
 Yeah.

268
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,400
 Tongues are sort of a thing where if you said that in front of my mother, she's the kind

269
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,720
 of person who says, "Oh, for God's sake, people eat tongue all the time.

270
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:26,020
 Every most days I eat tongue when you talk to them."

271
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,180
 But yeah, you would get it.

272
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,180
 I've seen it.

273
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,180
 Yeah, fair enough.

274
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,180
 Yeah.

275
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,180
 Not human.

276
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,180
 Not human.

277
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,180
 No.

278
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,180
 Not human.

279
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,180
 Of course.

280
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,180
 Yeah.

281
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,180
 Yeah.

282
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,180
 Yeah.

283
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,180
 Big bovine tongue.

284
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,180
 Oh, yes.

285
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,180
 Lovely.

286
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:47,620
 If you froze it, it could be like a reverse ice cream where it licks you.

287
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:51,160
 You still get the taste.

288
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,160
 So, yeah, I see.

289
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,680
 Well, I think that's the point about this guy with the dog, is that the guy could lick.

290
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,000
 He could lick the dog up and down without moving his tongue at all.

291
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 What a useful skill.

292
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,600
 I don't think that doesn't count as licking, if you just press your tongue against something.

293
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,600
 You haven't licked it.

294
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,600
 Does that not count as licking?

295
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,600
 She don't think so.

296
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,600
 I am very interested.

297
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:18,820
 I have an expert to bring in.

298
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,100
 I did not lick that person.

299
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,940
 I just pressed my tongue against them.

300
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,660
 I'll support Andy to the hilt here.

301
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,220
 A tongue press is completely different.

302
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,100
 It's very different.

303
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,100
 Great.

304
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,100
 Oh.

305
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:37,500
 Yeah, because in that case, the dog is doing almost like a catch having a scratching pole.

306
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:42,480
 The tongue is erect up and it would be the dog doing.

307
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,480
 That's right.

308
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,480
 The scratching.

309
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,480
 Yeah.

310
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,900
 I think it actually would count as a lick if the dog started moving up and down, grinding

311
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,900
 against the tongue.

312
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,900
 You're still not moving your tongue.

313
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:53,220
 Yeah, but, again, in court, you can't blame the dog.

314
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,980
 You can't say, "Oh, no, the dog was rubbing against my tongue."

315
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,460
 It's absolutely fine.

316
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,780
 I left my tongue there.

317
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,780
 Yeah.

318
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,620
 There's a complicated case, I think.

319
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,620
 It's very nuanced.

320
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,140
 We'll keep you posted.

321
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:11,660
 Christian Dainton writes, "You mentioned in the latest podcast that 1984 is an easy book

322
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:15,280
 to lie about having read, as most people know the important points.

323
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:21,920
 In my English GCSE, we studied the old man in the sea, which people wrongly call a masterpiece.

324
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,500
 The other class were reading 1984, and during the mock exam, I answered the questions on

325
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:32,160
 1984, as I thought I had better answers for it, despite not having read it at all."

326
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,160
 That's brilliant.

327
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,160
 Brilliant.

328
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,160
 How did they do?

329
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,880
 Please say they've attached the grade they got, because it's quite important.

330
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:45,220
 Unfortunately, I failed that exam, and my life has really gone to shit ever since.

331
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,220
 That's so funny.

332
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:49,380
 I wrote back and asked Christian, "Did you pass?"

333
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,900
 And Christian wrote back and said, "I think so."

334
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,900
 Oh, yeah.

335
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,900
 So, maybe.

336
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:54,900
 There's only a mock.

337
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,900
 Yeah, that's all the mock.

338
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:56,900
 The mock doesn't matter.

339
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,900
 What's a mock?

340
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,900
 Like, fake test?

341
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,900
 It's a practice.

342
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,900
 Get you ready.

343
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,900
 Here's another suggestion, actually.

344
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:07,260
 We're going to need to come up with a section name for suggestions of format tweaks or new

345
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,260
 formats.

346
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,260
 For this show.

347
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,200
 Yeah, yeah, for bonus content.

348
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,200
 Yeah.

349
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,400
 Thanks, but no thanks.

350
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,400
 Okay.

351
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:21,040
 I think that'll save the reply to everything.

352
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:29,160
 Weirdly, Andy's wife's response when she was asked, "Do you take this man?"

353
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,160
 Tunk.

354
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,160
 Go on.

355
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,160
 What's the idea?

356
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:38,240
 Martin Hill writes, "It would be really amazing if you guys did a club fish book club."

357
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,880
 I'm sure there will be a funny name or pun to be made there.

358
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,260
 "It will be really good to have a book set by yourselves alongside suggestions from club

359
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,820
 fish members, guests, and other elves.

360
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,340
 And it would be good for those of us that enjoy reading but don't find as much time

361
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,340
 as we would like."

362
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,340
 It's a nice idea.

363
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,340
 Mmm.

364
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,340
 It's a nice idea.

365
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:58,660
 I'm part of so many book clubs now that I end up, I've got book fatigue.

366
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,340
 Which club clubs would you recommend?

367
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,700
 Oh, as in, though, like, personal book clubs.

368
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,700
 Oh.

369
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,700
 It's just with me.

370
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,380
 Well, you and I used to be in the same book club.

371
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,380
 Yeah, that's right.

372
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:11,980
 Yeah, you've taken it over, and it didn't invite us back in.

373
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,620
 Oh, you're still in that one, Andy, that you told me about and how some people were dragging

374
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,460
 down the general standard.

375
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:21,680
 I just think some books that are suggested are not suitable, not everyone wants to read

376
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,680
 about Bigfoot every month.

377
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:29,400
 Maybe they need to open up their mind a bit.

378
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,400
 Recommend Richard Herring's book club.

379
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,400
 Oh, yeah, that's a great one.

380
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,400
 That's a great personality.

381
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,400
 Shall we do a book club where we owe a book club club?

382
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,680
 That's quite good, actually, yes.

383
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,680
 Well, you can only recommend a book club, because you can only be in a book club if

384
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,460
 you're invited to be in a book club, right?

385
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:47,940
 Yes, but the four of us could talk about The Old Man and the Sea, which we probably shouldn't

386
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:52,340
 on the first round of it, and then, you know, listeners could read along and then see what

387
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,340
 we thought, you know.

388
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:56,500
 Yeah, so we would announce here, in two months' time, we're going to be talking about this

389
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,500
 book on here.

390
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,500
 Yeah.

391
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,500
 I think that's a whole new show.

392
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,500
 Yeah.

393
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,300
 I think that's a whole extra podcast, which would be a great one to do, but I think we've

394
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,300
 got quite different tastes as well.

395
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,300
 Do we all have to read the book?

396
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,300
 That's the thing.

397
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,300
 Yeah.

398
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:10,500
 We might all, we could all read separate books and then talk across purposes.

399
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,500
 I would like that.

400
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,500
 Yeah.

401
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,500
 That is a fun idea.

402
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,500
 Yeah.

403
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,500
 Thanks, but no thanks.

404
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,260
 If you have any other ideas, do send them in.

405
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,260
 Yeah.

406
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,260
 Please.

407
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,820
 And we will reject them.

408
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,900
 But imagine if one makes it through, you know we're going to reject it.

409
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,620
 Imagine, you know, it's going to be so good.

410
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,620
 Yeah, that's true.

411
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,540
 That's a really good point.

412
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,540
 Here's one from Philip White.

413
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,540
 I like this one.

414
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:38,620
 So, in episode 508, you mentioned wire manufacturers, realizing they could use water instead of

415
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,380
 urine and it will work just as well.

416
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:45,160
 They use urine for ages and ages, and then someone asked if this was a recent discovery,

417
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:50,660
 because obviously it would only be the pre-enlightenment rubes who would use some esoteric beer/piss concoction

418
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:53,340
 in an industrial process before trying water.

419
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:56,940
 Well, let me introduce you to hydraulic fracking.

420
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:57,940
 Okay.

421
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:58,940
 Please do.

422
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,940
 Gosh.

423
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,700
 So fracking is where you're trying to get natural gas out of the ground, deep below layers of

424
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,060
 rock, and you pump in water, right?

425
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,060
 So in trying to...

426
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,660
 It's the communities where they probably don't want you to do it.

427
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,980
 Yeah, they're earthquakes and it all...

428
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:10,980
 Yeah, yeah.

429
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:11,980
 It's great.

430
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:12,980
 We don't need to take a position!

431
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,980
 No, no, no.

432
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:14,980
 You're right.

433
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:15,980
 We're neutral on fracking.

434
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:16,980
 Yeah, sure.

435
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:17,980
 If you want to sponsor us, fracking US.

436
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:18,980
 Drillbabydrill@fish.com.

437
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,980
 Yeah.

438
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:25,620
 In trying to extract natural gas from wells, oil companies used especially formulated gel

439
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,540
 to essentially flush the gas out of cracked rock well into the 1990s.

440
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:33,780
 It wasn't until cost-cutting measures tried diluting that expensive gel with water, then

441
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:38,780
 with even more water and less gel, and getting not only similar results but better output

442
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,920
 did they realise they could just use water.

443
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,920
 No!

444
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,540
 It revolutionised the natural gas industry overnight, cutting the cost per well by nearly

445
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,540
 half.

446
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,540
 Wow.

447
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,540
 That's an amazing fact.

448
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,540
 It's a great fact.

449
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,540
 Wow.

450
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,540
 But it's pumping all that gel underground.

451
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,540
 That's crazy.

452
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,540
 Oh my God.

453
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,540
 Sort of a jelly layer.

454
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,540
 Yes.

455
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:59,020
 So now a jelly layer then, under the Earth's crust, left over.

456
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,020
 That's so funny.

457
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:03,020
 All the north of England.

458
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,020
 Mmmm.

459
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,020
 Your neck of the woods, wasn't it?

460
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,020
 Got fracked.

461
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,820
 Some areas close to where I used to live, yeah.

462
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:14,860
 But it's all fine, isn't it?

463
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,860
 Sander Lutus writes.

464
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,860
 The ancient Roman orator.

465
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:25,100
 That's right.

466
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,100
 You were talking about whether the police ever used bum prints.

467
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,100
 They do.

468
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,100
 Oh.

469
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,940
 I was burgled back in 2017, and as the burglar kicked in one of the locked doors, they fell

470
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:37,820
 backwards into the wall directly behind them and caved in the plaster, leaving a big bum

471
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,820
 print.

472
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,820
 Amazing.

473
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:40,820
 And had no trousers on.

474
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:47,700
 When CSI came round, they took a print of the dirty shoe pattern on the door, and they

475
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:52,520
 also measured the bum hole left in the wall.

476
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,060
 The bum hole.

477
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,060
 Yep.

478
00:16:55,060 --> 00:17:00,060
 They never found any suspects to measure bums against, but the police did collect the bum

479
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,740
 print for that eventuality.

480
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:05,000
 I hope they would make a mold of it, so when you were called in to be interrogated, the

481
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 seat you sit into.

482
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:13,020
 If you're innocent, you just sort of move it around a little bit, you can't get comfortable.

483
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,020
 You can go.

484
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,020
 You can go.

485
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:18,220
 But when you get up to leave, the chair goes to you.

486
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:21,660
 This is the Cinderella story that I want to see.

487
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,660
 Oh, dear.

488
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:28,100
 And the nice thing about that email is Sander's surname is Lootus, and it's a story about

489
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,100
 Sander being burgled.

490
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,060
 Yeah, you shouldn't have called yourself that, should you?

491
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:39,460
 If you didn't want people to come and bum-burgle you, the bum-burgler.

492
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,620
 Here's something from Mark Vendt.

493
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,100
 Oh, that's my buddy.

494
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,100
 Really?

495
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,100
 Yeah.

496
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,100
 Yeah.

497
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,100
 Actually, he signs off as dance friend Mark.

498
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,100
 There we go.

499
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,100
 That makes a lot of sense.

500
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,100
 No, that's great.

501
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,100
 That's good corroboration there.

502
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:55,140
 There's a story about Henry Ford where he was showing a visit around his company, and

503
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,820
 the supervising engineer explained the assembly line.

504
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:02,420
 Ford interrupted to say there are 4,197 parts in a motor car.

505
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:06,060
 The impressed visitor asked the engineer if that was correct, and he replied, "I'm sure

506
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,060
 I don't know.

507
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:10,740
 I can't think of a more useless piece of information."

508
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,140
 Clearly that guy wasn't to know such a thing as a fish fan.

509
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:16,140
 What's been your most poorly received fact?

510
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,780
 That's a good question.

511
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,780
 Yeah, yeah.

512
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,260
 It's like a blind date question.

513
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:26,140
 Well chum.

514
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:33,500
 I think the fact that we're going to get together will be received very well, like the reception

515
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,860
 at our wedding when we get married.

516
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:41,060
 Well, we'll be serving tongue.

517
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,060
 I don't know what...

518
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,060
 I can't think of an example.

519
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,060
 I'm sure it happens.

520
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:48,020
 I can't think of loads, but you guys...

521
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:53,820
 Often, because we have a document of our facts that we're pitching to each other, and some

522
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:57,340
 of us, James puts in all new facts every time, he puts in four or five new facts, and we

523
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:01,460
 pick one, and then James insists on deleting the rest, but I would say the other three

524
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,460
 of us...

525
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,300
 No, sorry, I alternate my facts every other week.

526
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,300
 Okay, so...

527
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,300
 They're never helpful in two weeks.

528
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:11,860
 Okay, so whereas Dan and I think this is fair, we have some facts that have been in there

529
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,540
 for many, many months.

530
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,540
 And we just think...

531
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:15,540
 Because we believe in them.

532
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:19,740
 It's interesting, but the others, one day, having seen this fact nine times before, will

533
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,700
 come to it thinking, "You know, that is amazing."

534
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:26,380
 And you know, eventually you will delete them, but then they do come back like a bad penny.

535
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,100
 I sort of thought you wouldn't notice that.

536
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,100
 But we've definitely had a few.

537
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,980
 We've all had a few headline facts over the years where the other ones would have felt

538
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,980
 "Oh, that's a bit crap."

539
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,740
 And I think mine, it must have just been a bad week of other facts for me.

540
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:40,900
 I remember loving the fact that the person who invented Stroganov was the grandfather

541
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,740
 of the person who invented human chess.

542
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,740
 Yeah, I think that's good.

543
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,700
 Mine, I think it might have been great grandfather.

544
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,220
 When you say human chess, what do you mean actual human?

545
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,060
 Well, you can go back and listen to the episode that you were in.

546
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,780
 Don't say that's great, wouldn't bother.

547
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:56,300
 I've got one that I put in there that got nothing from you guys, and I still think is

548
00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:00,540
 incredible, which is that there was, I don't remember the details now because it's gone,

549
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:06,820
 but basically there's one example only ever of a military plane flying as high as possible

550
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:13,020
 to the edge of space, spotting and honing in on a satellite in space and shooting it,

551
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,020
 blowing it up.

552
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:18,940
 It's the only Earth to space missile hit and kill that we've ever had.

553
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:19,940
 I don't remember this one.

554
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:20,940
 I think that's for the number.

555
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,940
 Yeah, I remember that one.

556
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:22,940
 That sounds good.

557
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:23,940
 You should pop it in the dog.

558
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:24,940
 Please God, no.

559
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,940
 That's amazing though.

560
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:26,940
 That's incredible.

561
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:27,940
 Yeah.

562
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,180
 He shot a satellite out in space from Earth.

563
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,180
 That's incredible.

564
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,180
 In a plane.

565
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:35,820
 I think I've just remembered my poorly received fact about, well, there you go.

566
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:36,820
 Yeah, no.

567
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,140
 Mine was about the time of submarine got into a fight with a train.

568
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,780
 Yours are often technical.

569
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:46,620
 We take them down on like, oh, so it wasn't like it was a submarine in the ocean.

570
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,500
 And then the train was meeting it on like the border of the ocean and land.

571
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,900
 Yours was like, it was on the back of a truck.

572
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:52,900
 I agree, Andy.

573
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:57,340
 You'll sometimes be creative with your wording and we'll get incredibly excited.

574
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:02,260
 It's like a primped up CV and then you'll say, so what was this conference you organized

575
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,660
 and it'll be a game of Dungeons and Dragons or something.

576
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,980
 Okay, so, Mark, I think you've got your answer, so let's.

577
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:08,980
 Wow.

578
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:12,540
 Wow, that's opened up a few old wounds, hasn't it?

579
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,540
 Yeah.

580
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:16,860
 I just remember we got in a terrible row with each other.

581
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:20,420
 Me against three of you with about a half an hour to go before a show and it was in New

582
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,420
 York City.

583
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,420
 It was so exciting.

584
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,420
 Really?

585
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,420
 And it's about the definition of a shrimp.

586
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,420
 And it was so.

587
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:30,180
 And I just remember being almost blind with rage because my fact was being corrected with

588
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,180
 not long to go.

589
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,780
 And I think you guys are pretty annoyed that I've presented a fact about a dubious definition

590
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,780
 of a shrimp.

591
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,780
 With not long to go.

592
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,780
 Oh, yeah.

593
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,780
 I remember that.

594
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,780
 It was about the prawn cocktail or shrimp.

595
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,580
 It was about whether prawn cocktail was shrimp cocktail or something.

596
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,580
 Yeah.

597
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:46,260
 And it was, honestly, it was really tense.

598
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,260
 Wow.

599
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,260
 Yeah.

600
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,260
 Let's not go back there.

601
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,260
 It's too painful for me to remember.

602
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,380
 We've not had many moments like that, but not many.

603
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,380
 That sounds like that's something.

604
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:58,620
 What does happen quite often is that we all choose our facts and then someone about three

605
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:03,200
 days later will send a message and I'm going, yeah, I've researched that and it is true

606
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,200
 at all.

607
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,200
 That's definitely not true.

608
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,200
 No.

609
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,660
 It will be very diplomatic though.

610
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:11,460
 So try and notice it because what we'll do is then we'll come up with another fact that's

611
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,460
 in the same subject.

612
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,420
 So we're not wasting any research.

613
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,660
 So see if you can spot those.

614
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,780
 I'd be curious because there's a lot of people doing data at the moment.

615
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,780
 I have a feeling.

616
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:22,900
 This is not a slam on you, Andy, but I have a feeling like when we have those, when we

617
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,500
 have those moments, we do sometimes change the fact.

618
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:29,260
 But I think sometimes with your ones, we still do the fact and then there's an immediate

619
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,260
 qualifier after it.

620
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,300
 And that's not a slam because...

621
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:37,080
 Because it's just a way of, it's just a, we acknowledge it.

622
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,840
 So it's not like it's, you know, it's not bad.

623
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,760
 Yeah, it didn't feel a million miles from slam.

624
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,760
 Did you feel a slam?

625
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,760
 Ah.

626
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,760
 I felt patted.

627
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,760
 Didn't mean it.

628
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,760
 It's not a slam.

629
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,760
 A flick, I think, at least.

630
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,760
 I've been licked.

631
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,560
 It's not a lick, but your tongue was pressed against me.

632
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,560
 Hold on.

633
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,560
 Hold on.

634
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,560
 Hold on.

635
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,480
 Here's, this is really exciting.

636
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,480
 We've had an expert write in.

637
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,480
 Okay, cool.

638
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,480
 Dr. Richard Osborne.

639
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,480
 Cool.

640
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,300
 I'm very excited to find the top item on the latest episode of Fish related to Australian

641
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,300
 magpies.

642
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,300
 Oh yeah.

643
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,300
 Now that was with Mel Bracewells, I think.

644
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,300
 Maybe you were right.

645
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,300
 Okay.

646
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,820
 But I've seen them and they look not like magpies.

647
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:17,820
 Well, Richard Osborne, Dr. Richard Osborne writes, "My joy was somewhat soured when

648
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:23,340
 I heard that despite being the highly regarded inventor of the supremely effective party

649
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:36,080
 popper anti-magpie helmet, I was described as looking like an idiot."

650
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,520
 I'd want to be clear now.

651
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:44,720
 If I'd been on that show, I'd certainly not have happened.

652
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,720
 Why did he look like an idiot?

653
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,720
 I'm really sorry.

654
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,480
 That was me who said that he looked like an idiot.

655
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:55,820
 You know what, I can't even, because I can't imagine things, I couldn't remember what

656
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:56,820
 he looked like at all.

657
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,940
 So I was just assuming that he looked like an idiot.

658
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:02,860
 Also, there was one pipe you blew into and it blew out all the poppers at the same time.

659
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,860
 Yeah.

660
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:04,860
 So they're not party poppers, Anna, just to explain.

661
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,900
 They're not the ones that you pull and they go pop, they're more like the ones that you

662
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,400
 blow and they go up.

663
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,400
 Yeah.

664
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,400
 And they go outwards like the top.

665
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,400
 Oh, like a party whistle.

666
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,400
 Yeah.

667
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,900
 And he's got a bike helmet covered in these.

668
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:15,900
 That's amazing.

669
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,900
 And he blows.

670
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:17,900
 They can all blow out.

671
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,900
 Yeah.

672
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:19,900
 That's so cool.

673
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:23,520
 And if Anna was here, then she would have said that you look so cool.

674
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:28,400
 He says, "I'm sure you will enjoy reviewing the attached images which display this magnificent

675
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,060
 device in greater detail.

676
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:34,640
 In terms of my contributions to medical science as a senior oncologist for 30 years, I regard

677
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,080
 my innovation as the pinnacle of my whole career."

678
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,580
 So fair play.

679
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,580
 Brilliant.

680
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:43,960
 So picture him, you know, bike riding, his hand on, he's listening to his favorite podcast.

681
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,200
 That's coming down from all angles.

682
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:52,020
 He gets a mention.

683
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,780
 He's paused it.

684
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:58,380
 Kids, kids, daddy's on his favorite podcast.

685
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,860
 And they all called me an idiot.

686
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:03,020
 Well, let's see what the fish people think.

687
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:06,740
 Wait, stop the surgery, stop the surgery.

688
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:11,020
 I'm going to listen to this.

689
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:16,180
 He goes on, "I must also point out a factual error," just says, "There is crystal clear

690
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:20,400
 evidence that applying googly eyes to the back of a helmet does not prevent magpies from

691
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,400
 it."

692
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,400
 Oh, interesting.

693
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,400
 That is interesting.

694
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:27,920
 So we said, I said, I believe it was me, said that sometimes cyclists will wear sunglasses

695
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:31,360
 backwards on their head so that it looks like their eyes are there, which will put off

696
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,360
 magpies.

697
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,360
 Maybe sunglasses work.

698
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,360
 It's not clear.

699
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,360
 Okay.

700
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,360
 No, they don't.

701
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,360
 But googly eyes.

702
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,360
 Okay.

703
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,360
 I don't understand.

704
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,360
 Are they still on the back of your head?

705
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,360
 They'd fall off.

706
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,360
 Oh, you can do that.

707
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,360
 Do it now.

708
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,360
 You're wearing glasses.

709
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,360
 It's still there.

710
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,360
 Oh, yeah.

711
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,040
 Well, Dan, are you looking at me or going away from me?

712
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,040
 I can hardly tell.

713
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:56,360
 I can think I can say what he's saying, you look like an idiot.

714
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,360
 Lovely.

715
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,360
 All right.

716
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,360
 That's it.

717
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,360
 Bye.

718
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,360
 Beauty.

719
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:16,960
 That was great fun for us and we hope for you to the he's not done yet and it just got

720
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,960
 up to leave.

721
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,960
 Yeah.

722
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,960
 It felt like you were done.

723
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,960
 It actually did.

724
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,960
 I said bye.

725
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,960
 Then I do the outro though.

726
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,960
 You know, that's how we.

727
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,960
 Sorry.

728
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,960
 James has been on his phone.

729
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,960
 James is doing day trading on his phone.

730
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:39,560
 I was looking for some messages that people had sent me, but I couldn't find any.

731
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:44,320
 So you were just just waiting in your inbox hoping for someone like, shall I read one?

732
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,320
 Yeah.

733
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,320
 Yeah.

734
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,400
 So Kaz sent me a message on Instagram.

735
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,960
 No such thing as James Harkin.

736
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,960
 Hi, James.

737
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,960
 You are my favorite fish.

738
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,960
 Saut off me.

739
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,960
 That's a fake.

740
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,960
 That's right here.

741
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,960
 That's right here.

742
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,860
 I have an interesting fact.

743
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:01,760
 If you want to find out where someone originates from within Japan, you can spray them with

744
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,760
 a water gun.

745
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:09,520
 Apparently there was a Japanese TV show and what they did was they went around the country

746
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,160
 splashing people with a water gun and they all said different things depending on where

747
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,560
 in Japan they're from.

748
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:19,080
 So if you're from Bolton and someone did it, you're like, oh, bugger off.

749
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,120
 Or as if they're from London, you'd be like, oh, Saut off.

750
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,120
 Nice.

751
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,120
 That's right.

752
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,120
 Like that.

753
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,800
 Hey, since you're in your messages, there was an email that I felt really bad we didn't

754
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,760
 read out because it was so relevant to the podcast we just recorded and we all got an

755
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:37,080
 email from our great friend, Jason Haisley, who's lovely, and I thought that was such

756
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:41,140
 a good fact he sent us because he'd just been randomly doing a company's house search.

757
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,140
 Oh, yes.

758
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,400
 And he found this amazing email.

759
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,400
 Here we go.

760
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,400
 James has got it.

761
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:49,800
 So basically he randomly found on company's house that there's a company called My Neighbors

762
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:54,600
 possess an enormous superiority complex yet ironically they're both emotionally and intellectually

763
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,520
 very, very limited.

764
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:02,280
 I don't think Jason sent me that email.

765
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,280
 Ouch.

766
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,280
 Is that about you?

767
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:10,320
 No, no, from Jason Haisley to Daniel Schreiber, Anna Tyshinski, James, oh yeah, James Harkin.

768
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,000
 Just the three of us.

769
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,160
 Well, well, well.

770
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,160
 Sent it from Australia.

771
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,160
 All that way.

772
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:24,320
 Maybe there was only time to send it to three of you or the cost of sending to four recipients

773
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,160
 goes hugely up from three.

774
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,160
 Wow.

775
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,160
 Wow.

776
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,160
 Wow.

777
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,160
 Well, this is all good.

778
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:35,040
 I didn't mean to raise such a controversial issue so late in the day.

779
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,680
 What the heck?

780
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,760
 I didn't do that episode.

781
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,760
 You didn't do that episode.

782
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,760
 That's why.

783
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,760
 That's why.

784
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,760
 It doesn't make it hurt any less.

785
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,680
 It does not make it hurt less.

786
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:49,080
 As someone who didn't do that episode, you wouldn't be interested in an email from Jason.

787
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,080
 I would have thought.

788
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,080
 Absolutely not.

789
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,080
 Exactly.

790
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,080
 Right.

791
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,520
 Well, that's the tears well into Andy's eyeballs.

792
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,960
 How about a quick rounding off?

793
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,960
 Bye.

794
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:11,720
 Bye everybody, it's podcast at qi.com if you want to send us content, which we will sift

795
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,240
 and winnow and then read out.

796
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,240
 So please do that.

797
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,240
 Thank you.

798
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,720
 Sorry, I feel like I've gone a bit serious.

799
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,220
 We've had a really fun time.

800
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,720
 It's been great.

801
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,240
 It's been so much fun.

802
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:33,200
 So you know, stay careful and keep your back up and we'll see you next time.

803
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,200
 You'll hear us next time.

804
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:34,200
 Bye.

805
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:34,560
 Bye.

806
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,560
 Bye.

807
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,560
 Bye.

808
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,560
 Bye.

809
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:37,560
 Bye.

810
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,140
 (upbeat music)

811
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,720
 (upbeat music)
