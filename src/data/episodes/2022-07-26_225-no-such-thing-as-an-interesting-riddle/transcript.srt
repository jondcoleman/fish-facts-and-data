2
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:28,800
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from the Sydney Opera House!

3
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,800
 [cheering]

4
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:52,800
 My name is Dan Schreiber, and I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Huntson Murray, and James Harkin, and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in a particular order, here we go, starting with you, Andy.

5
00:00:52,800 --> 00:01:07,800
 My fact is that the BBC has sound effects, including indisposed chicken, more or less normal chicken, standard orgy, and comedy orgy.

6
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:16,800
 Now, it will be very remiss if we want to play for you some of these tonight.

7
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:26,800
 Have you got the clips? I've got clips all right, so yeah, they've got a sound off archive of 60,000 effects, and so here's indisposed chicken.

8
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:35,800
 [laughing]

9
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:44,800
 What, how often are the BBC playing out sitcoms where enter indisposed chicken? And indisposed to do what?

10
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:52,800
 I don't know, it's sounding pretty distressed though. So there's also, now we've got standard orgy here, just as a baseline.

11
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,800
 [laughing]

12
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,800
 I think I can hear a few chickens in there.

13
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,800
 [laughing]

14
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,800
 Yeah. It's definitely a cock and bull somewhere.

15
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,800
 And here, because I know we all want to hear it, is comedy orgy.

16
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,800
 [screaming]

17
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,800
 [screaming]

18
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,800
 [screaming]

19
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,800
 The BBC, ladies and gentlemen.

20
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:36,800
 And the amazing thing is, they've made this open to the public. This whole archive, 16,000 effects, and you can download them.

21
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:43,800
 And for non-commercial reasons, you can use them. And it's a fantastic archive. It's got such funny stuff.

22
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,800
 Just on those orgy clips, the legend at the BBC is that they were recorded by a studio manager in the 1970s.

23
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,800
 That sounds about right now at the BBC.

24
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,800
 [laughing]

25
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,800
 And though it was colleagues during their lunch breaks, he'd say, "Come on, you're coming up to make some orgy sounds during a lunch break."

26
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,800
 Is that right?

27
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,800
 Well, supposedly so, yeah.

28
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,800
 God, lunch breaks are more fun in the olden days.

29
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,800
 [laughing]

30
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:15,800
 Yeah, it's very cool though. So these are all now free to use for anyone, hence the reason we're allowed to do that right here right now.

31
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,800
 I think you asked for a special permission.

32
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,800
 I did ask for a special permission.

33
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:28,800
 In case we had wanted to use thirsty buttery cars in shed or two Xiaomi's cats, one coughing occasionally.

34
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,800
 [laughing]

35
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:38,800
 And if you want to play a fight sound effect, they've got three people brawling. They've got six people brawling.

36
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,800
 And if those aren't enough, you can do 36 people brawling.

37
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,800
 Wow.

38
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,800
 Yeah, it's been a long time reading this list.

39
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:51,800
 They have a riot in Belfast, don't they? Right in Belfast with breaking glass rubber bullets, distant cries and chants.

40
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,800
 And then they also have riot in Belfast, more subdued.

41
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:00,800
 [laughing]

42
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,800
 We're going to go for another take on the riot, guys. Could you just keep it down a bit this time please?

43
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:12,800
 Yes, I was specific though. They've like said they've got Belgian post office brackets busy, I think.

44
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,800
 Which is, if you want a French post office brackets busy, do you think that's a disaster?

45
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,800
 If only got the Belgian one, there's nothing we can do.

46
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:27,800
 Well, it's a really weird mix of things that were recorded specially, like for example comedy orgy, or things that are recording history.

47
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,800
 So they've got an air raid on Battersea from 1940 during the Battle of Britain.

48
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,800
 That obviously is not going to happen again, so you're not going to have a comedy air raid on Battersea.

49
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,800
 No, you're not going to have a comedy air raid on Battersea.

50
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,800
 [laughing]

51
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,800
 We're annoying.

52
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:53,800
 It's amazing, isn't it? When you look into the stories behind where sounds come from, as you say, they were at lunch break and they would come and do a comedy orgy.

53
00:04:53,800 --> 00:05:05,800
 That famous one, I think it's quite famous, they're in Jurassic Park, the sound of the Loser Raptors barking, that's a ruck, with turtles having sex.

54
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:13,800
 I don't know if you know that, but you can see footage and there's a lot of it online of turtles having sex, which I highly recommend.

55
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,800
 [laughing]

56
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:21,800
 And as they're going at it, there's this like kind of noise.

57
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:28,800
 And that's genuinely what they sampled for the turtle get on stage, where is it?

58
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:36,800
 I don't even do it right, it's such a lovely tone, but I think you've got to be in the mood, you know.

59
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,800
 But so the T-Rex is in Jurassic Park. When you see a T-Rex, it's a mixture of a bunch of different animal sounds.

60
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,800
 So the voice itself, for the breathing, they use the sound of a whale.

61
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,800
 They use lion's alligators and tigers for the low frequency of the roaring that was going on.

62
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,800
 But for the heavy breathing, the sort of of the T-Rex, that's a koala.

63
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:05,800
 No, and Aussie made it into Jurassic Park. And Aussie legend.

64
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:13,800
 This was so weird today by the way, so I was thinking about this fact and the fact I needed to do some research for it on the walk to the Sydney Opera House.

65
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:20,800
 And I was thinking about Foley artist. So this is obviously about Foley artist.

66
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,800
 And it's Jack Foley, the guy who kind of invented sound effects and made a lot of sound effects from our films.

67
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:31,800
 And I walked past a street called Foley Street, as I was thinking about Foley artist, isn't that insane?

68
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,800
 That's just a personal story. But...

69
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:44,800
 And what a story. Yeah. That was such an idea, my homework, but who do I have an excuse?

70
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:55,800
 I was doing some reading on Foley. No, he used to... So he is the sound of the walk of a lot of your favourite actors, if you're born in the 1940s, actually.

71
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:09,800
 So he's the sound of the walks of Laurence Olivier, of James Cagli of Marlon Brando, because he used to watch these people walk, because you couldn't get the sounds recorded sort of live, because the cameras weren't recording that close up.

72
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:16,800
 And he would watch them really carefully and imitate their walks. And then the sound of his feet hitting the ground were that.

73
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:24,800
 And they still do that today in nature documentaries a lot. So actually, when I was on this walk, I was listening to an episode of 99% Invisible Podcast.

74
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:33,800
 And very good show. And there was a guy interviewed Richard Hinton, who does these sound effects for animals in a lot of nature documentaries.

75
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:39,800
 And he says, "For walking animals, you've always used your hands, because you have much more control over your hands."

76
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,800
 And so if you're a lion, then you sort of do it quite lightly, and then if you're an elephant.

77
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,800
 It's amazing. Yeah, well, if you're a turtle, having sex.

78
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:59,800
 Yeah, it's doing the hands. Speaking of walking, awesome wells, he wanted a specific sound of people walking on sand. So he had an entire truckload of sand dumped tons of the studio floor for people to walk on.

79
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,800
 Unfortunately, it just dampened it. You couldn't hear anything.

80
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,800
 And they used to get amazing things that they were asked, so they were asked to do the sounds of snowflakes falling on snow.

81
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,800
 Or the sound of a nude woman sitting on a marble bench.

82
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:19,800
 What was that necessary? It's all in the hands.

83
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:25,800
 This is amazing. Bacon sizzling in a pan sounds identical to rain falling.

84
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:34,800
 No, you don't think it does, but I did a video on the internet, and I was tricked two times out of four, which is exactly no better than average.

85
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,800
 It's incredible. You think you know, but you don't.

86
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:45,800
 Really? Yeah. I mean, we're full of anecdotes tonight, aren't we?

87
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,800
 Do you know the big bolder in Indiana Jones, the one that rolls after India at the beginning of the first film?

88
00:08:50,800 --> 00:09:00,800
 Yeah. The noise of that is a Honda Civic set in neutral going down a gravel road on a very slight slope.

89
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:08,800
 But it works. It's amazing how yours can be dragged. In a fight club, all of the punches are the smacking of slabs of meat with pigs feet.

90
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,800
 But David Fincher thought that this sounded exactly right, but he was another one who took it really seriously.

91
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:26,800
 In fact, in one of the things in fight club, he asked a stuntman to fall down the stairs 12 times for one scene, and then he used the first take.

92
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,800
 He knew after the first take that he was using the first take and the other 11 were just...

93
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,800
 I pay for an hour, might as well.

94
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,800
 We're going to have to move on fairly soon, Ish, to the next bag.

95
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,800
 Oh, all my research is about orgies.

96
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:50,800
 Okay, on the Wikipedia for orgies, they have a section on Roman orgies.

97
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,800
 And apparently this did happen. It was an ecstatic form of worship that some cults had.

98
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:00,800
 Sounds all right, actually. It involved drinking wine. It doesn't seem to be much sex involved in fairness.

99
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,800
 It was involved drinking wine and dancing, which sounds okay.

100
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:09,800
 As well as eating raw meat, which is not quite as good, and self-castration, which is much less good.

101
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:16,800
 Of course, the self-castration does provide fodder for the raw meat, so it's still two birds going to stone, isn't it?

102
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:28,800
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Chazinski.

103
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,800
 My fact this week is that in the first Olympic marathon in 1896,

104
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:41,800
 the same stopwatch was used at the start and finish line, so had to be carried from one to the other ahead of the runners by bicycle.

105
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,800
 That's very cool.

106
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,800
 So this is the first model Olympics, obviously, in Greece.

107
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:55,800
 And yeah, it was held by a judge to stopwatch. It was started by this judge who clicked it, shoved it in the hand of a bicycle,

108
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:01,800
 and the cycle had to ride along in foul weather. It was really awful weather that day, and the road was very rough,

109
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,800
 and then cycle really fast to the finish line, so that the same stopwatch could be there.

110
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:11,800
 Also presumably, cycle without accidently pressing any of the buttons on the stopwatch during the process of cycling.

111
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,800
 But you could just have given it to the guy in front and said,

112
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,800
 "If anyone overtakes you to yourself, fucking over, yeah."

113
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,800
 Like kind of a relay.

114
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,800
 That's a great idea.

115
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,800
 I was thinking you could do it by car, but then obviously not back then.

116
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,800
 And actually, probably not now, certainly at the London marathon,

117
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,800
 because the average speed in central London at the moment for cars is 7.6 miles an hour,

118
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:40,800
 whereas the average speed for runners in the marathon is 12 miles an hour.

119
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:46,800
 In fairness, the London marathon is on a Sunday, so the traffic won't be so bad.

120
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,800
 But bad news, they close all the roads because the marathon is on them.

121
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,800
 Oh, yeah.

122
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,800
 This was obviously the first modern Olympics. It was very exciting.

123
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:02,800
 This marathon was emulating the great marathon of history that they wanted to do.

124
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,800
 Both history.

125
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:11,800
 You could at least narrow it down to the country.

126
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,800
 Not Australia.

127
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,800
 But what was very exciting about it, I think particularly for the room that we're in,

128
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,800
 is that entering that Olympics that year, there was an Australian team.

129
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:29,800
 And it was the very first Olympics, yeah, consisted of one person.

130
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,800
 He was a guy called Edwin Flack, and he actually ran in this marathon.

131
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:40,800
 It was quite far at the front at one point, but then he unfortunately had never run that far before,

132
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,800
 and got...

133
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,800
 While he was doing really well, he suddenly got really delirious, collapsed down,

134
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,800
 and one of the spectators came up to help him, got him up,

135
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:54,800
 and then Edwin Flack punched him.

136
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:02,800
 Yeah, the first, yeah, punching the spectator by an Aussie, or any country.

137
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,800
 He was... sorry, just on Edwin Flack.

138
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,800
 He was one of... I think there were 17 people running, and 13 were Greek,

139
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:14,800
 and so he was one of the remainder that were foreigners, and none of them knew how to long distance run.

140
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,800
 And so they all started out ahead, and all the Greeks had lots of practice,

141
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,800
 and so they all started out behind, and they all thought they were winning.

142
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,800
 And when Flack started winning, I think he overtook a French guy,

143
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,800
 and again, the cyclist was crucial, 'cause the cyclist cycled to the finish line to the big stadium,

144
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,800
 and said, "The Aussie's winning, the Aussie's winning, and then they were all devastated, 'cause they were all Greeks."

145
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,800
 And that's what they thought, 'cause there was no way of relaying this information,

146
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,800
 except having bloody cyclist there, who'd already peddled the stopwatch up to the front line.

147
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,800
 So, yeah, they really thought he was going to win.

148
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,800
 The guy who was eventually won by a Greek, and so the main medical check for this race

149
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,800
 was being tapped on the knee by a doctor, and then given two beers.

150
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,800
 That was it.

151
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,800
 So, everyone was a couple of beers in by the time they started.

152
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,800
 So, the guy who eventually won.

153
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,800
 This explains why the Australian did so well.

154
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:07,800
 The guy who eventually won halfway through, he bumped into his stepfather,

155
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,800
 who was waiting along the route a little in, who gave him some wine,

156
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,800
 and then he was getting really tired in this guy,

157
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,800
 and he asked someone who was accompanying him for water.

158
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,800
 It's a please, if he got any water, so he was given cognac instead.

159
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,800
 So, he finished the race completely half-cut.

160
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:29,800
 I think he spat out the cognac, I think, in disgust.

161
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,800
 So, the next Olympics, which was in 1900,

162
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,800
 the course markings were so poor in the marathon,

163
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:40,800
 that confused athletes could be seen running randomly through the streets of central Paris.

164
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:49,800
 And the absolute worst thing about it for me is that the winner was a guy called Michelle Teatro of France,

165
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,800
 but in second place was a guy called Emil Champion,

166
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,800
 and in third place was Ernst Fast.

167
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,800
 Oh!

168
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,800
 Wow.

169
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,800
 So sad.

170
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,800
 That's very sad.

171
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,800
 Yeah.

172
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,800
 It was really Teatro's responsibility to give that guy away, wasn't it?

173
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,800
 I mean...

174
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,800
 At least change his name.

175
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,800
 Yeah.

176
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,800
 To win or something.

177
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,800
 Well, in 1904, the marathon competitor who finished ninth,

178
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,800
 he should have done better, but he was chased a mile off course by dogs.

179
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,800
 [Laughter]

180
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,800
 Was that 1904?

181
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,800
 Yeah.

182
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,800
 Okay, and that same race was a Cuban postman called Andarin Carvajal,

183
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,800
 and he arrived at the last minute,

184
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,800
 and he'd lost all of his money in New Orleans,

185
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,800
 so he had to hitchhike to St. Louis,

186
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,800
 and he'd hardly eaten anything,

187
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,800
 so he stopped off at an orchard on route to have a snack on some apples,

188
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,800
 which turned out to be rotten.

189
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,800
 And so, despite having strong stomach cramps throughout the whole of the race,

190
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,800
 he ended up finishing fourth.

191
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,800
 Wow.

192
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,800
 I like this.

193
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,800
 There was this as many years later,

194
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,800
 there was a marathon runner called Canacurie,

195
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,800
 who he started the marathon,

196
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,800
 and then he went missing,

197
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,800
 and no one ever saw him again.

198
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,800
 And, yeah.

199
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,800
 They just lost.

200
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,800
 He was so fast.

201
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,800
 Yeah.

202
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,800
 [Laughter]

203
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,800
 Yeah.

204
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,800
 He was missing.

205
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,800
 He was missing, and then it turned out that what happened is,

206
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,800
 is that he lost consciousness,

207
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,800
 and he was rescued by a family on the side of the track.

208
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,800
 They brought him back to a house.

209
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,800
 He regained consciousness later and was nursed to health,

210
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,800
 but was so embarrassed about it, he didn't tell anyone.

211
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,800
 [Laughter]

212
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,800
 And so, he was listed as missing by Swedish authorities for over 50 years.

213
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,800
 [Laughter]

214
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,800
 Before he finally admitted that that's what happened,

215
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,800
 that he had, that he had done.

216
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,800
 He should have just sneaked back into the end of what of the marathons they were doing.

217
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,800
 Well, well, he did.

218
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,800
 He knew he was not going to tell me he did that.

219
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,800
 He went back on the 55th anniversary of the 1912 games to finish the race,

220
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,800
 and he holds the longest ever official marathon time of 54 years,

221
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:52,800
 eight months, six days, five hours, 32 minutes, and 20.3 seconds.

222
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,800
 [Applause]

223
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,800
 I've got a fact about a marathon, which I don't know if you guys have heard of.

224
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,800
 Oh, yeah.

225
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,800
 This is called the Barclay Marathon.

226
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,800
 This is the toughest marathon.

227
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,800
 Have you guys done it?

228
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,800
 Has anyone competed?

229
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,800
 No.

230
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:12,800
 Exactly.

231
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,800
 You think you're tough enough.

232
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,800
 Oh, my goodness, guys.

233
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,800
 Okay, get this.

234
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,800
 It's in Tennessee.

235
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,800
 You have to do five 20-mile loops all over a mountain.

236
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,800
 Okay?

237
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,800
 And you have to finish within 60 hours.

238
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,800
 So that's 100.

239
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,800
 It's very hard.

240
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,800
 You have to do the equivalent of running up and down Mount Everest twice.

241
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,800
 It only costs $1.60 to enter.

242
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,800
 [Laughter]

243
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,800
 Thousands of people have entered since it was started.

244
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,800
 Four.

245
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,800
 Sorry.

246
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,800
 And a t-shirt?

247
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,800
 You have to play fast.

248
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,800
 It's...

249
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,800
 Four times, though.

250
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,800
 Whatever, please.

251
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,800
 Yes, I...

252
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,800
 Yeah.

253
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,800
 You're absolutely bang on.

254
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,800
 But it's more efficient if I do it.

255
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,800
 [Laughter]

256
00:17:54,800 --> 00:18:02,800
 [Applause]

257
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,800
 But you're right.

258
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,800
 You're right.

259
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,800
 You're right.

260
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,800
 The guy who set it up, he requests that you bring him t-shirts,

261
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,800
 because he doesn't like shopping for clothes.

262
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,800
 So it might be socks or t-shirts, whatever.

263
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,800
 You have to get in.

264
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:20,800
 You have to email a secret email address on the right minute at the right day with an essay titled,

265
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,800
 "Why I Should Be Allow to Run in the Barkley."

266
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,800
 There's no path, so they leave 13 books trailed around the course.

267
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,800
 And as you go around, you have to take a page from each book to finish each loop.

268
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:33,800
 You have to sign a disclaimer saying, "If I'm stupid enough to attempt the Barkley,

269
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,800
 I deserve to be held responsible for any results of that attempt.

270
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,800
 Be it financial, physical, mental, or anything else."

271
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,800
 It's not...

272
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,800
 You don't get a medal, by the way, if you finish.

273
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,800
 [Laughter]

274
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,800
 What do you get?

275
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,800
 Do you get a t-shirt?

276
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,800
 You get nothing.

277
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,800
 It started in 1986.

278
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,800
 Nobody finished it until 1995.

279
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,800
 Wow.

280
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,800
 And so the...

281
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,800
 Just back on timers, the 2012 Olympics in London,

282
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:03,800
 they invented a timer which could measure accuracy to a millionth of a second.

283
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,800
 But no one really figured out what to do with it.

284
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,800
 [Laughter]

285
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,800
 Because obviously, that is such a small amount of time.

286
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,800
 In that amount of time, you saying bolts can travel not point,

287
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,800
 not, not, not, not, not one meters,

288
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,800
 which is about the size of a bacteria.

289
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,800
 [Laughter]

290
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,800
 Yeah, so more accurate timing devices are useless at Olympics.

291
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,800
 And this is a serious problem.

292
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:31,800
 People keep having ties because you only measure them to 100th of a second.

293
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,800
 Now for that, it's kind of unfair.

294
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,800
 So, I think there have been a lot of ties in the swimming since 1984,

295
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:42,800
 because in 1972, there was a tie when they measured it to 100th of a second.

296
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:47,800
 So they went to thousands and one guy beat the other by 2,000th of a second,

297
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,800
 which is much, much faster than the blink of an eye.

298
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:55,800
 And the thickness of coat on the swimming pool could easily massively override that

299
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,800
 by a long, long way.

300
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,800
 And so they realized it was completely unfair.

301
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,800
 So they just have loads of ties these days.

302
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,800
 In 2012, there was one where it went down to a coin toss or a runoff.

303
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,800
 Wow.

304
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,800
 And then one of them just sealed it in the swimming pool.

305
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,800
 [Laughter]

306
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,800
 That was a sprinting rate.

307
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,800
 We're just going to have to wait for this to freeze.

308
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,800
 [Laughter]

309
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,800
 Could you let your fingernails grow enough until you would win that race?

310
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,800
 Yeah, that's a really good one.

311
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,800
 I think if your fingers were 50 meters long,

312
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,800
 you could just go.

313
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,800
 [Laughter]

314
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,800
 I bet you'd have bigger problems, wouldn't you?

315
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,800
 [Laughter]

316
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,800
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is James.

317
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:43,800
 Okay, my fact this week is that in first century Denmark,

318
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,800
 if you were really rich, you were buried with a chicken.

319
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,800
 [Laughter]

320
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,800
 If you were really, really rich, you were buried with a goose.

321
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,800
 Wow.

322
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,800
 So, this is a thing that happened.

323
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,800
 Basically it was the Romans who had started to get up to that in Scandinavia,

324
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,800
 and the goose's were extremely rare.

325
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,800
 I think we said geese, just FYI.

326
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:12,800
 [Laughter]

327
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,800
 And I'm the editor of this podcast.

328
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,800
 [Laughter]

329
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,800
 And geese were really rare.

330
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,800
 [Laughter]

331
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:26,800
 And also geese, they represented the goddess Juno,

332
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:31,800
 and they found that not only have these people who were buried with chicken and geese,

333
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:36,800
 they're obviously kind of of high status because they have loads of other Roman goods as well.

334
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,800
 So yeah, that's a thing that happened.

335
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,800
 Just very good.

336
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,800
 Just wondering, what, you said that some people were buried with a chicken.

337
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:48,800
 Do we have any idea what it might sound like if the chicken was, say, indisposed before...

338
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,800
 [Laughter]

339
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,800
 I have a feeling we're going to do.

340
00:21:52,800 --> 00:22:01,800
 [Laughter]

341
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,800
 Thought of mine.

342
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,800
 I'm being buried with things.

343
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,800
 Oh yeah.

344
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,800
 There are ancient Peruvian shark fishermen graves,

345
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,800
 which have been excavated recently,

346
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,800
 and it turns out that they were buried with extra legs.

347
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,800
 What?

348
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,800
 Sorry?

349
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,800
 So...

350
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,800
 Are we sure that they just didn't have extra legs?

351
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,800
 I suppose we're not 100% sure.

352
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:29,800
 They had extra legs buried with them, so that two extra legs were left in one grave.

353
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,800
 Has anyone guessed why that might have been the case?

354
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,800
 Oh, whose legs they were?

355
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,800
 I think they were the legs of, I suppose, other Peruvian shark fishermen

356
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:43,800
 who hadn't had quite as long and happier career as the main guys in the grave.

357
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,800
 There are a lot of legless torsos buried nearby.

358
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,800
 I don't think we've found any yet.

359
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,800
 Again, this is research and it's early stages, so...

360
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,800
 [Laughter]

361
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,800
 Yeah.

362
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,800
 I really like that.

363
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:02,800
 In America, there were incidences of corpses being stolen for scientific purposes

364
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:07,800
 from graveyards during the US Civil War times by quite a lot.

365
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,800
 So someone invented a coffin torpedo.

366
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:15,800
 And yeah, so the coffin torpedo was if you were digging a grave,

367
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:20,800
 it would blow up basically from the inside of the coffin

368
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,800
 when you were trying to steal the body and kill the person who was trying to steal you.

369
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,800
 What?

370
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,800
 Or steal the person, yeah.

371
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,800
 And then there was one that was put on top of the coffin as well,

372
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,800
 so it didn't harm the actual interior of the coffin as well.

373
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,800
 And that was a big thing.

374
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:37,800
 They used to do things like put cages on top of graves to make sure that no one could steal.

375
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,800
 There's also, and this sounds really weird to me,

376
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,800
 the graveyards used to at one point have at the bottom of the,

377
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:50,800
 so you have the tombstone and right at the bottom there would be a shotgun just pointed up.

378
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,800
 And if anyone came and you might just be visiting, so I don't know how...

379
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,800
 [Laughter]

380
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,800
 ...how it worked, but you'd be killed.

381
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,800
 Wow.

382
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,800
 Yeah, that is hard.

383
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,800
 She might just want to say one last goodbye.

384
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,800
 So, if it's a family grave, just plop them in, I guess.

385
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,800
 So that would go down extremely badly in Madagascar,

386
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:16,800
 where they have a tradition of disinterring the dead every few years.

387
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,800
 So this is this, I think, really cool Madagati tradition.

388
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:25,800
 It's in the Famadihana people, and it's called the Turning of Bones.

389
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,800
 It happens every five to seven years.

390
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,800
 And you go to where your ancestors are buried, or where your grandparents buried,

391
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:35,800
 and you dig them up, you can change their clothes, because they've been wearing the same clothes for ages.

392
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,800
 And you then walk them around the village, so they can go two of the village...

393
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,800
 Wait, not...

394
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,800
 ...show them what's changed.

395
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,800
 ...between your shoulders, pretending they're still fine.

396
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,800
 Yeah, that's exactly what you do.

397
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,800
 You walk around, you go, "Oh, look, there's a coat there, didn't used to be there."

398
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,800
 That kind of thing.

399
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,800
 [Laughter]

400
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,800
 You won't remember that.

401
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,800
 They dance with them, so they dance around the graveyard within the cemetery.

402
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,800
 They hold the bodies above their heads, then they spray them with perfume,

403
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,800
 and they bathe them in wine.

404
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,800
 And they often rearrange the bodies into more human shapes,

405
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,800
 when sometimes time has taken its toll.

406
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:11,800
 And it's a really fun banquet, really, with the dead.

407
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,800
 If you're into that kind of thing.

408
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,800
 [Laughter]

409
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:20,800
 So, in China, it is illegal to be buried with a picture of a super girl.

410
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,800
 Oh, super girl.

411
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,800
 I will come to that, thank you.

412
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,800
 [Laughter]

413
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:32,800
 So, I think people mostly probably know that in China, they do this thing where they have paper offerings.

414
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,800
 So, they might put bits of fake money in your tumour, or whatever.

415
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,800
 And it's like things that you loved in life, or whatever.

416
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,800
 I mean, that would be so annoying the afterlife.

417
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,800
 If you got to the counter, and you wanted to buy all your stuff for the afterlife,

418
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,800
 they were like, "This is all fake, sir."

419
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,800
 Yeah, but...

420
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,800
 This is all counterfeit.

421
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,800
 If you're a fan of playing monopoly in the afterlife, that stuff would be very handy.

422
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:58,800
 You can't bring your own fake money to a monopoly board.

423
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,800
 Oh, yeah.

424
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,800
 You can't be a fool, I've got a new currency, I'd just like to pop in.

425
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,800
 That shows me I want a lot of games with that extra stack.

426
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,800
 The Murray Millions, I'll take everything.

427
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:16,800
 So, as well as they do have this kind of money, but they ban the price of vulgar offerings.

428
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:22,800
 So, that's such things as luxury villas, sedan cars, a Viagra, you're not allowed to.

429
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,800
 And then simulated models of supergirls.

430
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:31,800
 And that is based on the hit TV contest, Mongolian cow yoga supergirl.

431
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:36,800
 Please don't give away the ending of the latest series, because I'm only halfway through.

432
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,800
 I've actually heard of supergirl now that I think about it.

433
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,800
 That was the TV show, it's kind of like X-Factor, where it's all about singing.

434
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,800
 Yeah, and I think they said this is what I read in a newspaper,

435
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,800
 but I've not double checked to verify it.

436
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,800
 And it was a big British tabloid.

437
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:58,800
 It said that in China, so many people voted for the winner of the first series of supergirl

438
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:03,800
 that if you took all those votes and applied it to every other voting that has happened on planet Earth,

439
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:08,800
 it is the biggest collection of single votes for one thing that the Earth has ever witnessed.

440
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:13,800
 More than any election, more than anything else, because they don't really have elections there.

441
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:22,800
 Dan, how dare you? The elections in China are free and fair, and extremely concentrated on a single result.

442
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:28,800
 Sorry, just on China quickly as well, not so much burials, but funerals.

443
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:35,800
 Just very recently, the Chinese Ministry of Culture have announced that they're planning to eliminate strippers from going to funerals.

444
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:40,800
 And this is a custom that happens in China and Taiwan, whereby they like to make it a big party.

445
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,800
 And again, go online, you can see this.

446
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,800
 And dignitaries will have this.

447
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:50,800
 It will be girls on the top of cars, pole dancing and stripping.

448
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:57,800
 It's a big thing. In some cases, there will be 50 car processions, all of which will have a pole dancing stripper on top of it.

449
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,800
 Yeah, and they're trying to get that out.

450
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:03,800
 Although you should specify that strippers are not allowed to go to funerals.

451
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:08,800
 It's not like if your job happens to be a stripper, but your mum dies, you're not allowed to attend a funeral.

452
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,800
 Yeah, you're just not supposed to strip, actually.

453
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,800
 You just can't take your clothes off, yeah.

454
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,800
 But that's the thing that genuinely happens in there.

455
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:22,800
 It's just a celebration thing, and I think they tied it in with the fake money, where you put it in there.

456
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:33,800
 I was looking at animals being buries.

457
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:38,800
 Because pets being buried is more and more of a talked about and written about thing and pets, semitries and stuff.

458
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,800
 And people really want to be buried with their pets now.

459
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:48,800
 And there are actually a couple of really bizarre cases where people who are dying request that their pets be put down so that they can be buried together.

460
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,800
 What?

461
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,800
 Yeah, yeah. And American. And his Yorkshire Terrier.

462
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,800
 Look it up.

463
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,800
 So it's very weird.

464
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:07,800
 But there's this debate in the US. So in New York, for instance, you are now allowed to bury animal remains in human semitries with the human, but only if they're buried at the same time.

465
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:11,800
 So you're not allowed to sort of just have a pet funeral.

466
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:15,800
 But yeah, it's a big deal.

467
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:20,800
 That's amazing, because I remember reading somewhere eight years ago that their first pet semitries were open in Paris.

468
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:26,800
 I think at the time of the century, because they explicitly made it illegal to throw dead animals into the river.

469
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,800
 And so they were like, well, no, we need something else to do with them.

470
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:35,800
 When were the cult of health and safety let go of poor innocent Parisians?

471
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:40,800
 Well, Frederick the Great of Prussia wanted to be buried with his dogs because he was obsessed with them.

472
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:45,800
 And the court said you should be buried next to your wife and father in the royal cemetery.

473
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:51,800
 And so he was. They dissipate his wishes. That was in the 1780s.

474
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:59,800
 But in the 1990s, they respected his wishes and buried him with his greyhounds instead. So that's quite happy.

475
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,800
 I'm sure that, yeah.

476
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,800
 You know, Bella Legosi, who played Dracula.

477
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,800
 Yeah. He was buried in his Dracula cape.

478
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:16,800
 Cool. Yeah. Which would be a hell of a shock, wouldn't it, if you were digging him up, you know.

479
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:22,800
 There was a report in 1930, a few years before he died, saying he hopes to escape the shackles of the role.

480
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,800
 And clearly he did not. It's quite sad, actually.

481
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,800
 Yeah. That's bad. That sounds like it was an argument with his wife.

482
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:34,800
 He also, he had a guest book at his funeral, which I'd rather like. I think that's a cool thing to have.

483
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,800
 Yeah. Okay.

484
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:49,800
 I found a really odd thing, which is, King Richard III is buried in a casket that was made by his great, great, great, great, great, great, great grand nephew.

485
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:53,800
 Yeah. Great.

486
00:30:53,800 --> 00:31:02,800
 So he was, he was fat. I should add, I wasn't sure how many grades it was, so I kept going and you can edit it in the relevant amount.

487
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:09,800
 I'm going to put so many of them.

488
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:19,800
 And you're just going to sound like you're having a stroke.

489
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:25,800
 Wow. The podcast is two and a half hours long this week. How did all that happen?

490
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:30,800
 Is that so how did that occur? Is that someone enough great to go to the present day? And this is when he was reburied?

491
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:37,800
 Just remember, he was King Richard III was found underneath the car park. In fact, it was in our very first episode, one of the headline facts that we mentioned.

492
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:47,800
 And they had to prove who he was using the DNA via a living relative. And there was one guy called Michael Ibsen, who they were able to track it down.

493
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:57,800
 I've met him. Really nice guy. He was, he was, they used his DNA. They proved it. And he happened to be a carpenter. And so he said, can I make the coffin that he's going to be reburied in?

494
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:05,800
 That's really nice. Although, of course, after a certain distance, we are genuinely all related to certain people.

495
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:14,800
 So it's about at the Genghis Khan level. We are all directly descended from them. And he's not far from that. So it's not great. We're probably all his great, great, great.

496
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:25,800
 So are you telling me I'm Genghis Khan's great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great? And then you can use the rest.

497
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:30,800
 Okay, so I didn't do enough earlier. I've got a, I've got a riddle for you guys.

498
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:35,800
 Okay, my mother abandoned me. Oh, sorry, it's a head. That's the big deal.

499
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,800
 Let me do a bit later, buddy.

500
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:48,800
 It's a strange time to break it up, but oh, heck. Mum, if you're listening and I know you don't, I don't feel abandoned by you.

501
00:32:48,800 --> 00:33:05,800
 Here's the riddle. My mother abandoned me. I was found by a man who cut off my head, scooped out my heart and gave me something to drink. Then I began speaking. What am I?

502
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:11,800
 Okay, so anyone? It's going to be something to do with burials.

503
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:18,800
 It's going to be with the main fact, actually. Maybe not burials. Are you a goose? Are you a chicken? I'm a goose. Are you from Denmark? I've got a bit of a goose.

504
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:22,800
 Are you Fla Gra? I'm not Fla Gra, I'm a quill pen.

505
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:32,800
 Okay. My mother abandoned me. I was found by a man who cut off my head, scooped out my heart and gave me something to drink. Then I began speaking. It's very clever.

506
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:37,800
 I'm not surprised your body doesn't speak to you anymore.

507
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:43,800
 Don't invite him over for Christmas, honey. He's going to do his fucking riddles again. It's going to be.

508
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:50,800
 I think we found the answer tonight to the question of why do riddles go out in the 60th century?

509
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:57,800
 Why did his mother abandon it? Because the mother is the goose that gave it up when the man plucked the feather out.

510
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:06,800
 Right, okay, it's the feather, not the goose. Yeah, it's the quill pen. Yeah, sorry.

511
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:11,800
 Still room for a few hundred more grates where that bit was.

512
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:22,800
 We need to move on very shortly.

513
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:32,800
 I've got one last thing, actually, which I quite like. There is a company, should you, because when you're buried, you can decide either you go in a coffin or you have many other options, cremation or so.

514
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:42,800
 There's a company that actually will take the ashes of someone and they will grind them and heat them down to a sort of diamond, which they then put in a ring.

515
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:51,800
 So that is an option that you can get and their tagline is diamonds and grandma or forever.

516
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:59,800
 So you want that? I mean, I guess if you're proposing to someone, you could say my granny would have wanted you to have this ring.

517
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:03,800
 It was her. Don't you mean it was hers? No.

518
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:14,800
 Okay, we need to move on to our final fact of the show. And that is my fact.

519
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:34,800
 My fact this week is that before a magician, P.T. Selvett, invented the famous "Sawing a Woman in Half Illusion", his big trick was called the mighty cheese, which saw him daring members of the audience onto the stage to try and push over his massive block of cheese.

520
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:51,800
 That was this is the guy who became a legend. That was his initial trick. This is good trick. Yeah, so what it was is he would walk on stage and he would have a giant wheel of cheese and it was red and it was covered in wax.

521
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:59,800
 So it was like a big baby bell, basically, that he had. And he would say, "Who would dare come on to stage and push over my cheese? Who has the might?"

522
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:10,800
 And it was a great illusion because inside this big block of cheese, this big wheel of cheese, there was a gyroscope thing. So it made it impossible to actually do it. So I guess like all magic it was.

523
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:15,800
 Yeah, every time you tried to push it, I'll pull it, it would kind of jerk off at another direction and throw you to the ground.

524
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,800
 Yes.

525
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:28,800
 And he had a couple of stooches who would kind of deliberately fall over and whatever and he would always find the strongest looking people in the audience and then try and make fun of them about how weak they were and then get them to try and do it and maybe throw them everywhere.

526
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:35,800
 Yeah, it sounds awesome to me. It sounds like the cut in the lady in half is fine, but we've seen that a million times.

527
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:45,800
 But apparently it was not at all awesome. No one liked it. And he sold it to people and they kept reporting back going, "I've lost all my audiences."

528
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,800
 I don't know why I thought pushing over a cheese would be interesting, but...

529
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,800
 Did we say who this guy was? P.T. Sellbit.

530
00:36:52,800 --> 00:37:02,800
 He was born Percy Thomas Tibbles, but he took the name Sellbit by reversing his surname and subtracting one of the bees.

531
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:12,800
 You know, Penn and Teller, they are famous modern now magicians. They tried the same trick. They did a version of it on stage and they got to mix martial arts fighter to try and wrestle the cheese.

532
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,800
 And because it is a trick cheese, he failed.

533
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:25,800
 I don't remember Gregor's getting desperate these days, isn't he? After he failed, the martial arts fighter said, "I'm going to go home and cry now. I can't beat a cheese."

534
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:30,800
 This thing of selling tricks though, I didn't quite realise this was a thing, even amongst the great legends.

535
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:39,800
 So P.T. Sellbit himself had a big argument with Houdini at the time because Houdini said that he'd stolen his walking through the wall trick.

536
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:48,800
 He said Houdini had stolen his walking through the wall trick and Sellbit said he'd actually bought the trick from another magician, but they were just buying tricks from each other.

537
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,800
 Houdini was buying tricks from people. He wasn't coming up with anything.

538
00:37:52,800 --> 00:38:00,800
 And just to put P.T. Sellbit in context, this was a person whose name disappeared to the layman, but magic.

539
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,800
 I'm going to make my name disappear.

540
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:11,800
 We can all perform that kind of trick in our term. I think after tonight's show, we might have done that.

541
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:18,800
 But yeah, he was a hugely important, interesting guy, so the big cheese was sort of a minor bit of his career.

542
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:24,800
 The sawing a woman in half, absolutely revolutionised. It's still used to this day to the standard that he did it.

543
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:33,800
 He effectively introduced the magician's assistant. When he had his assistant, Betty, I think her name was, come and do the sawing in half for the first time.

544
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:42,800
 That revolutionised still going today. He did a trick in front of Arthur Conan Doyle, which convinced Arthur Conan Doyle of the spirit world.

545
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:49,800
 Spirit was a massive thing to Arthur Conan Doyle that believed in the afterlife and fairies and so on, and that was P.T. Sellbit.

546
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:54,800
 No, he always believed in the spirit world. He was the most global man we've ever researched.

547
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,800
 He always believed in donkey who told him the spirit world was a thing.

548
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:05,800
 But yeah, he did show him his relation, didn't he? His dead relations. Did he dig them up and carry them around?

549
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,800
 This is your great, great, great, great.

550
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:16,800
 And then Sellbit struggled, didn't he, after doing anything after the sawing the lady in half,

551
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:22,800
 his late tricks were known as destroying the girl, stretching a lady and crushing a woman.

552
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:29,800
 Wow, so he really had a team of people. One of the things he did to promote the show was to have stage hands

553
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,800
 pour buckets of blood into the gutters outside the theatre.

554
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,800
 Wow.

555
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:43,800
 And it was all 1920s-ish, 1910s and 20s. It was all kind of due to anxiety over suffragettes, women's liberation.

556
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:50,800
 And he once invited Christopher Bell Packest to be sawing in half on stage for 20 pounds a week, she said no.

557
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:59,800
 But just the thing you said down of inventing the magician's assistant, it was kind of only made possible by the change of women's fashion.

558
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,800
 Because before that, you had very bulky clothes, you had a lot of petty codes.

559
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:09,800
 It wouldn't be very hard to fit the woman into the box in the first place, because what she was wearing.

560
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:15,800
 And even then, she's running so many courses that is unlikely you could saw her in half, even if you wanted to.

561
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:22,800
 And then there was like, I guess, flapper fashion, was it? Yeah, and then flapper fashion comes in and some people fit in the box.

562
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:29,800
 Although I do have a news for you Andy, I don't think that they were actually sawing the woman in half.

563
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:34,800
 I've done spoiler it for me. I've got tickets to the circus next week.

564
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:43,800
 Do you know that in Queensland, Australia, that you're not allowed to own pet rabbits?

565
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,800
 There's obviously huge problems with rabbits in the country.

566
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,800
 So in Queensland, you're not allowed to own it. Unless you're a magician.

567
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:59,800
 Yeah, there's a magician called Mr. Brit. There's only 34 magicians in Queensland who are permitted to have this.

568
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,800
 This thing where they're allowed to rabbit. And Mr. Brit is one, the rabbit's called Mr. Fluffy Bum.

569
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:07,800
 And Mr. Fluffy Bum is one of the only privately owned rabbits in Queensland.

570
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:14,800
 I have a fact about pulling rabbits out of hats, which is the guy who, it's pretty vague who actually invented pulling a rabbit out of a hat.

571
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:20,800
 But a lot of people think it was a magician called Louis Comte who was, I think, a French magician. He did so in 1814.

572
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:30,800
 But I believe the first time he did it, sources are pretty few on this. The first time he did it, he also simultaneously pulled his infant son out of the hat.

573
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:39,800
 That's the same time. I don't think he was holding the rabbit. He said, "What have we got in here? Oh, we've got a rabbit and a baby."

574
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:44,800
 He's weird that the rabbit wants stuck around, isn't it?

575
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,800
 Do you know what I think? It's more impressive to pull a baby out of that.

576
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,800
 I think it's more impressive, but it's harder to get a baby.

577
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,800
 That's why it's more impressive. Oh, yeah, it's more impressive.

578
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:04,800
 Do you know the original of pulling a rabbit out of a hat? I think it's pulling an omelet out of a hat.

579
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,800
 I was looking for this because it's very controversial what it is.

580
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:12,800
 People say, "We definitely know the 1840s is the first time we pulled a rabbit out of a hat collectively."

581
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:19,800
 But I did find something in the lead's intelligence in 1823. It was this court case. It was a report for court case.

582
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:24,800
 A man was suing a magician for the cost of a new hat because he spoke to the magician.

583
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:30,800
 The magician has said, "If you imitate me and break an egg into your hat, then you'll get an omelet out of it."

584
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,800
 Just imitate my movements exactly. He'd upturned his top hat as I had the magician.

585
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,800
 The magician had broken an egg into his hat, flipped it up, and an omelet comes straight out of it.

586
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:43,800
 Whereas the guy had done it, flipped it up, and he'd got his entire suit covered in raw egg.

587
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:47,800
 That's a bit of an asshole's trick, isn't it?

588
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:52,800
 That's pretty bad. It's like, "Right, if you do exactly what I do, I'm going to saw this lady in half.

589
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:57,800
 You saw your wife in half."

590
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,800
 Guys, we're going to have to wrap up shortly.

591
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,800
 I've got a fact about magic tricks going wrong.

592
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:06,800
 Do you remember when Secret of Roy, who did the magic with the Tigers?

593
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:11,800
 Roy, Roy Horn, I'll have Secret of Roy, but he was grabbed by the throat by a Tiger in 2003.

594
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:15,800
 Now, the good news is, he made a great recovery, and Dr. Senny would never walk or talk again. He absolutely did.

595
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:21,800
 He made a fantastic recovery, but I didn't know the story that they have agreed on for the version of events,

596
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:27,800
 which is this. Both Roy and Secret insisted that the Tiger had sensed that Horn was having a stroke

597
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:32,800
 and was dragging him to safety.

598
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,800
 Where could the Tiger go that it would think would be safe?

599
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:41,800
 Horn, now 74, said, "I will forever believe it was his concern for my safety and well-being

600
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,800
 that caused him to act as he did."

601
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,800
 That's amazing. Just one little thing on magic words.

602
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:54,800
 Yeah. So the magic word "expelliarmus" is from Harry Potter, I think, isn't it?

603
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:59,800
 According to the Oxford English Dictionary, it comes from the Latin "expelleray",

604
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,800
 meaning "to drive or force out" and "armor", which means "weapon".

605
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:08,800
 But unfortunately, "armor" was also a Mufmism for penis.

606
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:15,800
 So Harry Potter is probably saying something like, "Penus, begun!"

607
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:22,800
 Does that mean the first line of "Virtuals and Need" is "I sing of penis and the man"?

608
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,800
 I think a lot more people got the Harry Potter reference.

609
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:35,800
 I'm trying to get why your mum is not interested in that.

610
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,800
 Oh, come on, mate!

611
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:43,800
 Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening.

612
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:48,800
 If you would like to get in contact with any of us about the things that we have said

00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,800

 Just put no such thing as a fish on the internet. You'll find us.

 And we will be back again next week with another episode, guys.
