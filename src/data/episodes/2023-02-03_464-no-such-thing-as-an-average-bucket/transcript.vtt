00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.120
 Hi everybody, just before we start this week's show, we have an exciting announcement to make.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.860
 And that is that the National Comedy Awards are coming up very soon.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:18.400
 And the great mothership that is QI and the mother herself that is Sandy Toxfig.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.220
 How creepy, I don't know how she'd feel about me calling her my mother.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.900
 But that is Sandy Toxfig are both up for awards.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.120
 That's absolutely right.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:33.400
 QI is nominated for Best Comedy Panel Show and Sandy, or Mummy as I call her, has been

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.120
 shortlisted for Outstanding Female Comedy Entertainment Performance.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.800
 We think that both are deserving winners, so if you would like to go and vote for QI or

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.800
 for Sandy in those awards, go to qi.com/vote.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.560
 So easy to do and so important that you get your vote in and help us destroy all comedy

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.360
 competition, which as we all know, is the point of comedy.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.480
 Yes, exactly, flatten all that comedy.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.660
 And if you do want to remind yourself why they're the best, all of QI is now available

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.560
 on BBC iPlayer, go and watch a few episodes and convince yourself that they both deserve

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.560
 to win.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.560
 That's qi.com/vote.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.560
 Do it now.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.560
 On with the show.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.560
 On with the show.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:33.320
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.120
 to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.200
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, Anna Tyshinski

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.320
 and James Harkin, and once again we have gathered round the microphones with our four favourite

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.480
 facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.880
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Anna.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.040
 My fact this week is that the first female composer to become a dame used to tie herself

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.920
 to trees to improve her posture.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.600
 I have a question.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.520
 Was her posture originally too bent so she stood next to a tall tree or was it originally

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.640
 too straight as she stood next to like a weeping willow or something to bend herself over?

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.200
 Tied herself to one of those really droopy branches.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.560
 I believe it was to the trunk.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.400
 She didn't specify, I think she left it for us to assume.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.400
 This was an amazing woman called Ethel Smyth.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.560
 She was writing music and conducting and creating, you know, operas and all sorts of classical

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.800
 music at the turn of the 20th century, and there's a new book coming out which covers

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.800
 her life.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.520
 It's going to be called Quartet.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.120
 Sounds great coming out in spring by someone called Dr Lea Broad, and she read an account

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.400
 of an interviewer who went to meet Ethel Smyth at one point to interview her about her music

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.720
 making, and she found that she was tied to a tree and specifically to improve her posture

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.720
 as a conductor.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.720
 Oh, come on.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.720
 No.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.720
 Something went wrong.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.160
 Some sort of weird sex game went wrong.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.160
 The interviewer.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.160
 What are you doing?

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.160
 Oh, no.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.160
 It's for the old conducting.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.160
 You're so right.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.160
 Come on.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.880
 It's actually sort of a sex minx, so I reckon it was that.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:11.880
 Yeah.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.840
 Yeah, but you can't admit that to the interviewer first thing, can you?

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.320
 And then you have to just carry that on for the rest of your career.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.040
 You just go to people that sort of recommending trees, you know, you've got a big pot plant

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.720
 with a thick trunk there in the orchestra pit tied to it mid show, which is what you

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.720
 should do.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:28.720
 She's amazing.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:29.720
 Yeah.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.720
 She is incredible.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.560
 So, she was very successful in her time given how unlikely it was for a woman to be

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.200
 successful in composing writing music.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.520
 What was her time specifically?

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.600
 She was born in 1858.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.600
 She died in 1944.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.600
 Yeah.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:48.000
 And a lot of her most famous works will have been around the 1880s, 1890s and the early

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 1900s.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 Yeah.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 And she was prolific.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 She wrote so much.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.480
 She wrote six operas, which operas are a big feat.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.200
 And it plus loads of chamber music and orchestra and stuff.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.720
 She played for Queen Victoria and for Edward VII.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.600
 And she was so ambitious that we know that she kept a diary throughout her childhood

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.720
 and she wrote in her diary, age eight, that she intended to be made a peer because of

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.720
 her musical prowess.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:12.720
 And lo and behold.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.720
 She was.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.720
 And she was.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:15.720
 Yeah.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:16.720
 That's amazing.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.720
 It's good to have something to aim for, isn't it?

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.720
 Yeah.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.280
 Because actually, when she was a child, I read that she was quite good at sports.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.920
 This was on the Surrey Government website and it said, "From the beginning, when she was

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.800
 a child, she won a bet for riding a pig and to the end of her long life, she was a keen

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.800
 sportswoman."

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.800
 Really?

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.280
 So, yeah, that shows how keen you are at sports.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.280
 She was.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.280
 She definitely won lots of contests.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.800
 And in lots of different sports, I think she was very vigorous, picture like a good mistrunchable

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.800
 maybe.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.080
 So, she did like mountaineering, tennis, hunting, cycling, golf.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.080
 Golf.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.080
 Golf.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.080
 Yes.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.080
 Very keen on golf.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.080
 James, she did do golf.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.080
 Yeah.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.080
 I must admit, most of my facts are about walking golf club.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.080
 Oh!

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.080
 Golf.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.000
 So, here is the thing why James actually might theoretically have a point dragging us into

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.600
 the golfing world is that I was looking up her Dame Hood, which was 1923, the Honours

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.600
 List then, and she was convinced it was because she was a member of the Woking Golf Club.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.600
 Oh!

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.600
 Really?

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.600
 Okay.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.560
 She had friends in high places, kissing some ass, where it matters.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.560
 Oh, wow.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:23.440
 Well, it was owned by a guy called Lord Riddell, who was a bigwig, a bit senior lawyer and

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.680
 a newspaper proprietor and all that sort of stuff, and he was a member of the club and

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.700
 so was she.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:37.120
 And there was a big dispute about the changing rooms, where the women members wanted to walk

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.240
 across a shortcut, a short route.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.240
 What?

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.240
 I know.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.320
 And it took them past the men's changing rooms to get to the women's rooms.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.320
 Nightmare.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.520
 And the men were very uncomfortable about this.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.760
 The women walking past the changing rooms, I'm not sure if the men's changing rooms

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.560
 were just sheet glass in the windows or something like that, but I don't think they would have

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.560
 seen anything.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.200
 But also, it's not like a swimming pool.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.720
 It's not like you have to take your kit off completely to put your golf shoes on.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:01.720
 You're absolutely right.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.720
 What?

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.720
 What are they doing there?

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:04.720
 Well, anyway.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.720
 What do men do in changing rooms, actually?

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.000
 Suddenly, it's way more suspicious for them to kick up this big fuss.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 You're right.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.400
 I don't know, but James, you presumably spend a lot of time in those...

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.400
 You might have a shower.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.400
 Oh, there we go.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.520
 So, basically, the men were uncomfortable about this situation with the women walking

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.480
 near their changing rooms, and they demanded that the women be banned from playing golf

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.240
 for weekends as a sort of proportional response.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.380
 And Smythe actually told the ladies' committee, "Look, let's give the men a slightly easier

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:29.540
 ride on this one.

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:34.000
 Maybe they're just incredibly modest, and they're worried about it."

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.600
 And the sort of militant women, almost all of them, abandoned this shortcut route.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.560
 So, she basically sold out the sisterhood and gave the men at the golf club a slightly

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.960
 easier time, and she thinks that because Lord Riddell was maybe friends with the PM, he might

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.200
 have said, "Look, we should make this woman a Dave."

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.720
 Lord Riddell had a particularly tiny penis in him, so relieved.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.880
 It's a particularly dangerous place to tie yourself to trees, as well, a golf course.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:59.880
 Yeah.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.240
 Certainly if I'm playing golf, you'd know I'd be tired of any trees near me.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.240
 She...

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.040
 When I read her story, I've never heard of her before, but she just...

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.520
 It's begging for a movie to be made about her life.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.600
 She was a suffragette.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:15.160
 She played a big role in composing songs for the suffragettes, but she also had rumors

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.680
 of affairs going on with people like Emmeline Panchurst and...

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:20.680
 Everybody.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.680
 And Virginia Woolf.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.800
 Although, these are all kind of rumors, and I think Virginia Woolf was the one who started

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.960
 the Panchurst rumor, suggesting that they were lovers, but she spent time in jail for

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.280
 throwing stones.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.280
 She was just...

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.760
 She was a badass, basically.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.960
 I think she was in love with both of those two people.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.800
 I think she was a woman who fell in love quite a lot.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.840
 You get the impression, and it was sometimes reciprocated and sometimes not.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.880
 I mean, Virginia Woolf wrote when Ethel fell in love with her.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:48.520
 She wrote in her diary, I think, "An old woman has fallen in love with me.

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.520
 It's like being caught by a giant crab."

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:51.520
 Oh.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.520
 Which is not what you want, is it?

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:54.520
 No, not really.

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:55.520
 You don't say "yes" to that.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.520
 No.

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:57.520
 It just comes at you sideways.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.520
 Exciting.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:07:59.520
 Founces.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.800
 We should talk about the thing which landed her in prison, because this was a brilliant

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.800
 incident.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.680
 It was in 1912, and the really cool thing is you could hear her talking about it.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:12.720
 There was a recording made before she died, but she was saying at 5.30pm, one evening in

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:18.360
 1912, relays of women produced from their muffs and handbags, hammers and things like

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:23.200
 that, and proceeded to methodically smash up windows in all the big London thoroughfares.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.480
 And Mrs. Pankhurst was the one who kind of opened the bowling on that occasion, so she

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:31.360
 threw a stone at 10 Downing Street, and then simultaneously, all over London, suffragettes

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:35.120
 and suffragettes were throwing stones at various buildings, and she was one of them.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:40.440
 So she went to the house of someone called Lord Harcourt, who had annoyed her, and she

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.440
 got to the Target Square.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.720
 There was a policeman standing around, and she said, "Whose house is that?

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:46.720
 What about that one?"

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:50.320
 He threw a stone through the window of Lord Harcourt, and he says, "Will you come quietly?"

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.320
 And she said, "Yes."

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:54.080
 And then he arrested her, and she went off to prison.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.080
 That was it.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.080
 That was the protest.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.080
 That's cool.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:01.400
 Virginia Woolf said that she was the first ever woman to write an opera, and she was

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.680
 wrong about that, because the first woman to write an opera was someone called Francesca

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:12.080
 Caccini, and there was about 250 years before Ethel Smythe came along.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.520
 And Caccini, she was amazing.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:19.120
 She sang at the wedding of Henry IV of France, and he was so impressed by her singing that

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:25.760
 he asked her to stay in his court, and by the time of the 1620s or the top of her career,

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:31.120
 she was the highest-paid musician in the court by this woman, and her opera, which was the

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:37.760
 first written by a woman, this is called La Liberazione di Ruggero, and it was so good

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:42.960
 that the King of Poland heard it, and he rushed all the way back to Poland and created his

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:47.320
 own opera house just so that he could get someone to play this opera in it.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.320
 Wow.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.480
 It was such a hassle before, Gramophones or CD Plays.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.480
 Spotify.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:53.480
 Yeah, yeah.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.980
 Had to build a bloody opera house.

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:57.920
 To be fair to Virginia Woolf, no internet for her.

00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.360
 No, she couldn't Google it, could she?

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.360
 We had to make a guess.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:05.120
 Do you know we have mentioned Ethel Smythe on this podcast before, but without knowing

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.120
 it.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.120
 Oh.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.120
 Dun, dun, dun.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:13.800
 So, do you remember listeners at home, and you guys, you know the Bishop of Truro, Edward

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:18.280
 White-Benson, who invented the carol concert, the Christmas carol concert.

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:21.960
 We talked about him because he had this amazing family.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:28.920
 His wife was gay and kept a diary of her 39 lesbian lovers, and had lots of affairs,

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:33.320
 and we mentioned that his wife was going out with this particular woman, who was then stolen

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:37.880
 by his daughter, and it was this raunchy love triangle where mother and daughter were fighting,

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.120
 and that was Ethel.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.120
 Wow.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.120
 That's it.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.120
 Yeah.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:46.800
 It's obviously a different world now for composers, female composers, but survey was

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:52.560
 done in 2020 to see on an average year, how many orchestral concerts worldwide were playing

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.000
 music that was composed by women.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.520
 So in percentage terms, what do you reckon it would be?

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.200
 Oh, they're still really low.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.200
 Miniscule, I should think.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:07.480
 Yeah, so they surveyed 15 orchestras worldwide, who did more than 1,500 concerts, and did

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:11.680
 4,000 pieces, and what it comes out is 8.2%.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:16.680
 So only 142 of the pieces were composed by women, which is not much more than it was

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:23.360
 in her day, according to this stat from Don, D-O-N-N-E, which is women.

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.360
 Don.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.880
 Your mate Don, Don the dog, I've met him, yeah.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:27.880
 Yeah, Don.

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:28.880
 I don't know if he's reliable.

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:31.200
 Don my research for me this week.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:34.840
 It's a women in music charity foundation, and they did this as a big global survey to

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:35.840
 find out.

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:41.160
 So it's that song about him, isn't it, Don, D-O-N-D-O-N.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:46.720
 The problem is, I suppose, is that orchestras tend to play classical music, and it is all

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:51.880
 from the past, and almost all past composers were men, so it's so hard to sort of create

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:54.360
 a female composer from the 1800s.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:59.200
 But certainly there should be more contemporary ones, which still are.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.680
 Just one more thing about Smythe, she wants kidnapped her own opera.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:03.680
 Oh, yes.

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:04.680
 Mid-show.

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.400
 This is so cool.

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:11.800
 It was in Leipzig in 1906, her opera The Wreckers had its debut, which is about a load of people

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.640
 who wreck ships.

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:18.380
 She found out there had been edits made, which was absolutely furious.

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:23.120
 She found some cuts had been made to the third act, and she walked into the orchestra pit.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:27.160
 She took the parts off the musicians, and she took the score with her, and she went to

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:32.400
 Prague, where she thought she'd get a fairer hearing and get a played in full.

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:33.400
 The nuts move.

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:36.480
 For someone who's achieved what no one could have really dreamed a woman would achieve

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:39.000
 at that time, God, they're putting it on in Leipzig.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.560
 It got standing ovation, huge deal.

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:44.360
 She storms off in a strop with all the stuff they need to play it.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:49.320
 I just find it so funny, though, that how vulnerable are classical musicians that, when

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:52.320
 the paper's taken away, well, that's it.

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.560
 We can't do anything.

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:56.400
 We can't remember the chords like any other song.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:57.400
 What could you do?

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.400
 It's a long, it's a long song.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:59.400
 It's not a Westlife song.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:00.400
 Opras are long.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.400
 Opras are long.

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.240
 Oh, if you're playing a violin, you can memorize.

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.240
 You can memorize a piece.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.240
 Dude.

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.240
 No, they've just seen this piece.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.600
 I think that, you know.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.320
 Bands play for three hours.

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.920
 It's the same chords, guys.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:12.920
 It's the same instruments.

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:13.920
 Everyone!

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:14.920
 There's no extra chords.

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:15.920
 LA.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:16.920
 Everyone.

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:17.920
 Play LA.

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:18.920
 Right?

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:19.920
 No, everyone.

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:20.920
 LA.

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:22.760
 There's no extra notes that classical people have that coldplay don't have.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:23.760
 But sometimes.

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:27.560
 And if you're a classical musician, if you're a classical bassoonist and you think that what

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:33.440
 you do is no more difficult than a rudimentary coldplay song, please write to Dan, podcast

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.440
 at qi.com.

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:35.440
 Yeah.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.440
 Yeah.

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:37.440
 We crave to hear from you.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.440
 Let me hear.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.440
 Okay.

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.440
 You're telling me.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:41.440
 Let the bassoon meet the buffoon.

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.720
 Bruce Springsteen does five hour gigs.

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.220
 You're telling me you're better than him?

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:46.220
 Bassoon boy?

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:47.220
 He's been playing.

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:48.220
 Oh my gosh.

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:52.000
 And also, yeah, he's been playing the same tunes for 150 years.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.920
 He hasn't seen, I've got a three hour opera put in front of him two days ago.

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:59.280
 He's like, bloody hell, rehearse this and then you're going to play it in two nights.

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:02.280
 It's like a panic dream for any normal human being.

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:05.800
 Dan, he wouldn't have got it first time, a quick glance.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:06.800
 Nailed it.

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:07.800
 Got it.

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:08.800
 Tears up the paper.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:09.800
 No, no, no.

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:10.800
 Forget that.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:11.800
 How do you forget that?

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:12.800
 No, no, no, no.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:13.800
 Thank you and good night.

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:14.800
 Good night, Vienna.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:15.800
 Okay.

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:24.320
 It is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:32.840
 My fact is that TV screens are cut from a massive TV screen called the mother glass.

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:33.840
 The mother glass.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.480
 The mother glass itself, does it work as an enormous TV screen?

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:37.800
 I imagine it would do.

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:38.800
 Oh, cool.

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:43.680
 But it's so big that I don't think they've made the TV big enough.

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.600
 You wouldn't be able to get out the factory, would you?

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.600
 I should say where this comes from.

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:51.800
 This comes from a brilliant Atlantic piece about TV tech and the main focus of it was

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:54.000
 that actually the TVs are so cheap.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.280
 TVs are way cheaper than they used to be, and there are various reasons for that.

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:02.480
 One is that LED panels, which are now the main ingredient in TV, they're much cheaper,

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:07.840
 and another reason is the mother glass because manufacturers are way better these days at

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:11.880
 cutting screens out of the mother glass, so there's much less wastage, and so that's

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:14.960
 part of the reason why TVs are so much cheaper.

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.160
 So how do you make mother glass?

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:21.280
 It's basically the glass, so this is, we're talking about LCD screens, aren't we, which

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:25.800
 are basically what your TV screen property is today, and you've got your two thin sheets

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.840
 of glass sandwiched together.

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:31.400
 I think in between the two thin sheets of glass, there's like a liquid crystal thing

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:35.840
 which acts as the conductor, and so you just have this huge sheet of that glass, and I

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:42.600
 think each sheet can be dozens of feet, the mother glass, and so you can cut, you know,

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:45.080
 10, 10, 15 TVs out of that.

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:48.800
 And how they make glass, I don't know if they still do it this way, but I think they

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:49.800
 do.

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:50.800
 It's basically float glass.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:55.640
 So float glass was invented in the 50s in St. Helens, near where I'm from, and the idea

00:15:55.640 --> 00:16:00.560
 is it was really hard to make flat glass in those days, but what they worked out is you

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:05.880
 could put a load of glass on a load of molten tin, so you melt a load of tin to a really

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:10.040
 high temperature, and then you put the glass on it, and it sits perfectly on top of it,

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:15.440
 like if you pour oil on water, it would just be a small film of it, and then when the tin

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:19.760
 and the glass cools down, you can just sort of peel it off, and it'll be a really flat

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:24.360
 piece of glass, and I think that's still how they make flat glass, so it certainly was

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.360
 10 years ago.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:26.360
 That's amazing.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:29.040
 You know, researching this fact, I just came across so much new vocab.

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:30.040
 It was great.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.240
 It was like researching a foreign language.

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.960
 Well, you don't watch much TV, do you, Hannah?

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.320
 That's true, so.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.140
 So there's a fab.

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:43.440
 Fabs are constantly referred to when you're talking about, like, high-end technological

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.120
 production, and these are factories in China.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:49.000
 It's short for fabrication plants, and no one ever explains what they are, because they

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.160
 assume if you're reading these articles, you definitely know what a fab is, so all of these

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:54.160
 screens are made in fabs.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:59.600
 Apparently, you can spot an LCD screen-making fab, because they'll be very tall.

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:04.200
 They'll go up many, many stories, and they will hoist the equipment up the outside, so

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:07.600
 they have big windows on the outside where they hoist the equipment up, and then they

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:11.440
 just hoist it in to where they need it.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:16.040
 Everyone in there looks like they're in hazmat suits or Ebola fighters, because they have

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:20.080
 to have what you call clean rooms, because it's so fine.

00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:24.440
 You're working with, like, atomic-level stuff, and when you're making these very specialized

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:27.400
 screens, you can't get a single speck of dust.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:34.240
 So the rooms have to be what you call a class 10 clean room, or even a class 1 clean room,

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:41.000
 and what that means is that you have to have fewer than one particle smaller than 0.3 microns

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.180
 in diameter per cubic meter of air.

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:47.840
 So for comparison, so that's class 1.

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:50.000
 So who was that the best?

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 That's the best.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 Are you about to ask who cleans?

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000
 Who counts them?

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.440
 And I'm not going to ask who goes in and counts them.

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:56.440
 Yeah.

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:57.440
 Yeah, that's an 8.

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:59.200
 That's 8 of those.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:03.040
 Some, yeah, technician with a magnifying glass.

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:07.080
 So for comparison, the article I was reading, which I guess was written by someone in Harvard,

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:11.640
 so they compared it to Harvard Square, they said Harvard Square would, in Boston, would

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.920
 be class 8 million.

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:14.920
 Oh, right.

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:17.500
 Just in the air, not even on the ground.

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:21.820
 In the air, yeah, in the air, 8 million particles per cubic meter.

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:22.820
 This has to have one.

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:24.980
 If there's more than one, you shut down the factory.

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:25.980
 Wow.

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:26.980
 That's awesome.

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:27.980
 My TV's got one of these.

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:28.980
 It's so annoying.

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:29.980
 What?

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:31.980
 Well, I think it's actually more of a dead pixel, but it's just this tiny spot and it's

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:33.780
 absolutely dead center.

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:37.380
 Everything I watch, whatever's in the middle, has like a small fly on it.

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:38.380
 Really?

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:40.020
 But you're always watching the darts, aren't you?

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:41.020
 Are you sure?

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:42.020
 Yeah.

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:45.680
 I'll stop drooling in when I watch it.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.240
 That's so funny.

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:53.520
 You were saying that they need to be really thin and part of the reason for that is because

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:58.580
 to make your glass non-reflective, you need to put a kind of film on it.

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:02.480
 So if you just have normal glass, all the light's going to reflect off it, you're not

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.120
 going to be able to watch TV properly.

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:07.880
 And so they have something called non-reflective glass, and that was invented by someone called

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:10.540
 Catherine Burr Blodgett.

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:18.140
 And what she did was she basically would build up these one molecule films of atoms,

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:21.540
 and then she put another layer on and another layer on and another layer on.

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:25.500
 And so she could control exactly how thick it was going to be, and she worked out the

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:29.980
 exact thickness that it would have to be to make this glass non-reflective.

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:31.460
 It's absolutely incredible.

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:36.140
 The first movie that used her invisible glass was Gone With The Wind, and people said when

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:40.360
 they watched it how clear the cinematography was because the cameras had been using this

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:41.360
 amazing glass.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:42.360
 When was this?

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:43.360
 This, well, Gone With The Wind was '39.

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.360
 Oh, so it was when it was released.

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.560
 I didn't realize they could do that kind of thing.

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:48.560
 Well, exactly.

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:49.560
 Amazing, right?

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:56.120
 But it was also her glass or her non-reflective glass was used in World War II to make periscopes

00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:57.120
 as well.

00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.120
 Oh, cool.

00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:01.960
 And I was looking into new TV innovations and just trying to see if there's a TV that

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:02.960
 I haven't seen.

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:06.100
 Most of it is kind of just permutations, isn't it, at this point?

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:10.580
 It's just, you know, like, higher, higher, you know, Blu-ray, screen, you know, blah,

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:11.580
 blah, blah, blah, kind of stuff.

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:15.700
 Why were you fired from Curry's then?

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:20.220
 If you're a TV maker at the moment, and Dad's just saying how piss-easy it is to make a new

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:26.500
 TV, I just add a permutation right into Dad's right now.

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:27.500
 God.

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:28.500
 So, check this out.

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:32.200
 This is Samsung, and this is clever.

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:35.980
 Samsung have released a vertical TV.

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:37.980
 They've turned a TV on its side.

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:38.980
 Yeah.

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:39.980
 Cool.

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:42.560
 Now, it's very clever because why do you think they've done this?

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:44.380
 Oh, because people film vertically on the phone.

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:45.380
 Exactly.

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:49.300
 So, the new generation of kids that are sending their videos to the TV are not getting the

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:50.300
 proper view.

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:51.300
 Well, wait a minute.

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:52.300
 So, if I buy that TV, great.

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:55.880
 My daughter will be able to watch her TikTok videos whenever she's old enough to.

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:56.880
 And you'll have to watch the Sopranos.

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:57.880
 The Sopranos?

00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:58.880
 No.

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:04.780
 So, Samsung very cleverly have made it so that you can flip it back the right way around

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:05.780
 and you still have.

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:06.780
 I know.

00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:07.780
 I feel that's a gimmick.

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:12.040
 I'm going to say major, major advancement in the innovation of TV.

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.040
 Okay.

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:14.040
 All right.

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.040
 Here's another one.

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:19.940
 In fact, this sort of links back to why TVs are cheap these days is the TVs that watch

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:20.940
 you.

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:21.940
 Oh.

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:22.940
 Oh.

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:25.940
 It's not such a good show as the Sopranos.

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:26.940
 Poor things.

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:27.940
 No, no, no.

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:30.980
 The Sopranos are bored out of their fucking minds watching this guy.

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:35.900
 He's trying to rub off a little spot on his TV.

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:38.940
 So this is a really interesting thing.

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:39.940
 TVs are smart.

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:40.940
 They're internet connected.

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:42.900
 All TVs sold these days pretty much are that.

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:47.180
 And one thing that loads of TVs do, they collect your data and they will sell it to advertisers,

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:48.180
 right?

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:51.640
 And what that means is that TVs can be sold more cheaply because they know that for the

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:57.020
 next several years, they're going to be getting your data and that will be worth some money

00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:58.020
 to them.

00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:03.620
 So TVs are now being sold effectively for exactly what it costs to make them and then

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:06.420
 they will sell you viewing data and they can make the money back on the long run.

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:10.340
 And sometimes the data will be sold to places like Netflix, even if you don't have a Netflix

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:12.460
 account, which I find so bizarre.

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:13.460
 Yeah.

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:14.460
 And I think that might-

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:15.460
 Makes sense.

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:18.420
 I wonder if that theoretically means that when you turn on Netflix for the first time,

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:21.420
 if you do later get Netflix, they're like, "Ah, Mr Murray."

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:24.240
 "We've been expecting you."

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:29.240
 But jokes on them because I always make sure to only watch stuff I hate on my smart TV.

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:32.200
 That's really interesting because I do the same on Amazon.

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:35.240
 I only buy things I hate just to get those things.

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:36.560
 Just screw with those algorithms.

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.320
 They don't know what data they're getting.

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:40.680
 It's not the truth.

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:47.720
 I read about a very old bit of TV technology that I just had never heard of before and

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:52.060
 it seems an extraordinary thing, but have you guys heard of phone vision for TVs?

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:53.060
 No.

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:54.060
 Don't think so.

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:59.920
 Okay, so this was back in the '50s and what it was is that this was pay for TV.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.700
 This was like pay-per-view TV.

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:05.740
 So if a movie had been out in the cinema for two years, they managed to get the rights

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:09.360
 to it and they would put it on TV and it would be the first time anyone would be seeing it

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:10.940
 on TV in their house.

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:14.800
 So how do you do pay-per-view for TV back then when you don't have the kind of payment

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:16.660
 systems and stuff that we do now?

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:18.120
 There was one that had a coin meter on the side of the TV.

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:22.600
 There was one that had a coin meter at night, but this is more interesting in a weird kind

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:24.000
 of technological way.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.800
 What they did was you would go to the channel and you would see the movie playing, but it

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:31.600
 would be completely blurry and all just didn't make, you know, the sound wasn't there and

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:32.600
 didn't make sense.

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:35.120
 So you could see like, "Oh my God, Don with the wind is on.

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.120
 I need to get to it."

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:40.120
 And what you did was you then called up an operator and you told them that you would

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:41.720
 like to now watch this movie.

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:44.960
 It would cost a dollar and they would add that to your phone bill and what they would

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:50.380
 then do is send a frequency through the phone that would somehow play with the TV and un-blur

00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:52.700
 it and give you all the sound.

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:56.300
 So it was your phone and TV working together to get a frequency right.

00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:57.300
 Yeah.

00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:00.980
 I mean, it's mad and they did many tests on it and never kicked off, obviously, because

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:01.980
 various reasons.

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:05.140
 If you were quite stingy, because this is definitely what I would do, especially if

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:08.940
 I was a teenager or something, do you know if you could watch the whole thing, but like

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:12.660
 the blurry crap version that didn't really make sense, like that would keep playing?

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:13.660
 I think so.

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:15.920
 I would totally do that and just sort of try to work out.

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:19.480
 You know when you used to get like bootleg DVDs from foreign countries?

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:20.480
 Filmed in a cinema.

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:21.480
 Yeah.

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:24.400
 And you watched the bottom quarter of the screen and you'd only see half of their bodies.

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:25.400
 Yeah, exactly.

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:29.840
 I was reading about what claimed to be the first remote control, the lazy bones.

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:33.720
 And it was a remote control and it was connected by a cable to the television.

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:39.520
 So it's not completely remote and the operation is mechanical, it's not electronic.

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:42.280
 So you know, when you press it now, it's a little infrared beam or whatever.

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:46.860
 These days, if you press the button, it activated a motor that was used to physically turn the

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:48.580
 dial on the television.

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:53.420
 It feels like this should be a little hand-like thing for the Adams family to do.

00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:54.420
 Yeah.

00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:58.740
 On remote controls, is that what your family calls those items, everyone else, what do

00:24:58.740 --> 00:24:59.740
 you call it?

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:00.740
 I'd say the buttons.

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:01.740
 The buttons.

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:02.860
 They say channel changer.

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:04.340
 Channel changer, that's not unusual.

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:11.140
 We used to call them the magic buttons and there was a list online of someone did a survey

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:16.800
 of what people in the UK call them and magic buttons wasn't in the top 100, I should say.

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:18.600
 But the number one was remote.

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.880
 Can you guess any of the others in the top five?

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.200
 We haven't said them yet.

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:23.200
 The doofa.

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:24.200
 Doofa number two.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:25.200
 Yes.

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:31.940
 The word doofa originally meant half a cigarette in the 1920s and it came from this will doofa

00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:32.940
 now.

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:33.940
 This will do for me.

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:34.940
 That's brilliant.

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:35.940
 Nice.

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:36.940
 Okay, so that's remote doofa.

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:37.940
 Was it one?

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:38.940
 Was one the thing?

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:39.940
 Like a magic?

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:40.940
 That's not one that I saw.

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:41.940
 The thing?

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:42.940
 No.

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:44.940
 Zappa, Flickr and Flickr.

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:45.940
 Jobby?

00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:46.940
 Jobby.

00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:48.940
 Jobby, you got something to say about that.

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:51.940
 Someone's left a jobby on the arm of a sofa.

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:52.940
 No, Anna.

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:54.540
 Put the jobby on the table where it belongs.

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:57.940
 You haven't seen much Billy Connolly, have you?

00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:01.940
 Jobby, I believe, is only a euphemism for poo, to my knowledge.

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:02.940
 Okay, come on.

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:06.940
 You used the word jobby when you can't think of the right word for something.

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:07.940
 They're right.

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:08.940
 You passed that jobby over there.

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:12.940
 Your poor housemates come home with remote controls in the toilet again.

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:14.940
 Puts doesn't make any sense.

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:16.940
 You're just plunging away at it.

00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:18.940
 They were leaving poos on our tables.

00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:20.940
 I never understood why.

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:28.940
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is my fact.

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:33.940
 My fact this week is that Queen Charlotte once got seasickness while visiting an art

00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:36.940
 exhibition on land.

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:37.940
 Amazing.

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:44.940
 I can't believe we got a fact about sickness.

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:47.940
 Literally recovering from food poisoning.

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:50.940
 I just feel like a terrible listener, just so you know.

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:54.940
 I got this fact from a brilliant book by a buddy of ours, Edward Brook Hitching.

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:57.940
 It's called The Madman's Gallery, which is an incredible book, by the way.

00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:01.940
 I love his books and this is a beautifully illustrated book all about the weirdest and

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:05.940
 most quirky and curious bits of art that have been made over the course of history

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:06.940
 all over the world.

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:09.940
 It's like he's curated this really stunning book.

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:13.940
 And one of the chapters talks about this incredible thing that happened just five

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:18.940
 minutes walk from where we are, Leicester Square, down the road in 1790s.

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:24.940
 In 1794 particularly, when Queen Charlotte went to see what was a giant panoramic piece

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:30.940
 of art, huge in a purpose built building so that you could go inside and be immersed

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:32.940
 by this extraordinary scene.

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:37.940
 And one that he did was a sea battle and Queen Charlotte went to see it and she was

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:42.940
 so immersed and felt so overcome by all the movement of the ships that she got seasick.

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:46.940
 And there's a few stories that said she vomited into her handkerchief.

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:48.940
 There's others that say she was very nauseous.

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:49.940
 Yeah.

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:50.940
 But yeah.

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:51.940
 Which handkerchief?

00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:53.940
 Was that a blower or a shower?

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:54.940
 Must have been the blower.

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:55.940
 It was a vomer.

00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:57.940
 It was a special handkerchief.

00:27:57.940 --> 00:27:58.940
 Yeah, it's interesting.

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:06.940
 She, I think the main part of the story comes from the memoirs of the man who created this

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:10.940
 panorama, whose name was Barker, Robert Barker.

00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:16.940
 And he wrote that Charlotte had told him that she had felt seasick at the time.

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:19.940
 There is a suggestion that he was quite a salesman.

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:20.940
 Yes.

00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:21.940
 I used to make stuff up.

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:22.940
 Absolutely.

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:23.940
 So there's a chance it might not be true.

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:24.940
 Totally.

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:27.940
 But there's a chance though of just like how people who went in.

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:28.940
 That's for sure.

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:29.940
 It did happen.

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:30.940
 The people got seasick.

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:31.940
 Yeah, people got seasick.

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:34.940
 But also the thing was that the paintings themselves were, they were beautiful paintings,

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:37.940
 but they were sort of presented in this way that they kind of were a bit of an illusion

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:42.940
 that you got a bit confused that maybe something was going on and your eyes were playing tricks

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:43.940
 with you.

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:48.940
 So in the sea battle one, there was a capsized shipboat and there was sailors that were struggling

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:49.940
 in the waves.

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:52.940
 And according to one story, there was a guy who was visiting and he had his dog with

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:59.940
 a Newfoundland dog and this dog saw the drowning man in the painting and leapt over to rescue

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:00.940
 the drowning man.

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:01.940
 That is one of the stories.

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:05.940
 Again, I think that was used in the advertising for the panorama.

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:09.940
 I think whether it happened, it might have happened, but yeah, they said this is so realistic,

00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:10.940
 but this happened.

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:11.940
 Yeah, exactly.

00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:12.940
 Keep your dogs at home.

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:13.940
 Do not risk your dogs.

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:14.940
 That's so funny.

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:18.940
 I'm imagining like the end, you know the end of the Truman Show where the dog bites through

00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:22.940
 the screen and he's suddenly in the real world.

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:23.940
 It's not a spoiler.

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:24.940
 He's been trapped.

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:25.940
 It is, yeah.

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:30.940
 If you haven't seen the end of the Truman Show yet, James, it's almost as old as Anna Karenina.

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:37.940
 This building is so cool and like Dan says, the building where he hosted lots of his panoramas,

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:39.940
 I went to it today.

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:40.940
 Oh, did you?

00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:41.940
 Yeah.

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:44.940
 It's right next to the Prince Charles Cinema and the Leicester Square Theatre, you know,

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:48.940
 the street just off Leicester Square and it's now a French Catholic church.

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:50.940
 It's the church of Notre Dame de France.

00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:52.940
 And you're a French Catholic, aren't you?

00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:54.940
 So you just have to be taking a map.

00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:55.940
 That's how I got in.

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:56.940
 Yeah, yeah.

00:29:56.940 --> 00:30:01.940
 And it's, you go into the church and it's a completely round church and you think, oh,

00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:02.940
 that's interesting.

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:07.940
 It's not a classic, your classic church cross shaped and it's beautiful in there and you

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:08.940
 can, you can really imagine.

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:09.940
 You could still go in.

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:10.940
 That's really interesting.

00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:11.940
 It's completely open every day of the week.

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:15.940
 He actually invented the word panorama, he said.

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:19.940
 And he, it is worth thinking about how amazing it would have been to go into this place.

00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:20.940
 It was two levels.

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:24.940
 And so I think he had two panoramas exhibiting in there at the same time.

00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:25.940
 Yes, yeah.

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:29.940
 And it was kind of like when you go to a fairground, like one of the bit more crap rides where

00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:30.940
 you just walk around it.

00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:34.940
 But still, you look at the big painting on the ground floor and then he went through a

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:39.940
 series of pallet cleanser dark corridors and staircases so that you could have raised that

00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:42.940
 from your mind so that you could get up to the next floor and enjoy that one.

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:46.940
 Even to get to the first one, you had to go through some weird dark corridors, didn't you?

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:49.940
 And the way that it was lit was really impressive.

00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:54.940
 Like it was lit from above using natural light, but it meant that it was really realistic.

00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:57.940
 And so you would kind of go through all these dark corridors, dark corridors and then you'd

00:30:57.940 --> 00:30:59.940
 be hit by this incredible scene.

00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:00.940
 Yeah.

00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:04.940
 But what that did mean was that at certain times of the year, it was better than others.

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:07.940
 So for instance, if the weather wasn't good, it wasn't that good to see.

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:09.940
 If it was foggy, you probably wouldn't go.

00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:11.940
 If it was raining, you probably wouldn't go.

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:13.940
 In winter, you probably only go on midday.

00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:15.940
 The rest of the day, it was not quite so good.

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:19.940
 And it was like a shilling to go, which is not that much, but to some London as it was.

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:21.940
 So if you're going to spend your money, you go on a really good day.

00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:22.940
 But they kept putting them on.

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:25.940
 So he started in 1787, painting his first ever one.

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:28.940
 And it opened up in London in the 1780s or '90s.

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:32.940
 At the Leicester Square one, they had a new show every couple of years until 1861.

00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:34.940
 So they had 126 different panoramas.

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:35.940
 So good.

00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:36.940
 It's a huge industry.

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:39.940
 And it meant you could travel the world from London.

00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:42.940
 You could see all sorts of different cities and places and historical things.

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:45.940
 You could see battles and you could see revolutions.

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:47.940
 And it just sounds unbelievably good.

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:52.940
 And what's particularly beautiful about it is so you do have the ones where it's all battle scenes.

00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:57.940
 And the painters used to go and interview people of the area and they would try and get the landscape.

00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:01.940
 But for me, the most beautiful ones are there was a panorama of Edinburgh.

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:07.940
 And what it was is he stood up, I think, with his son on Coulton Hill in Edinburgh.

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:10.940
 And so when you stand in the centre of this panorama,

00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:15.940
 what you're seeing is literally the view absolutely perfectly matched for what you would see

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:18.940
 if you were standing in his shoes when he was painting it.

00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:21.940
 I just find that absolutely stunning as a concept.

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:22.940
 That was his first one.

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:24.940
 I mean, that is the premise of all paintings.

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:26.940
 You'll see what the painter was seeing.

00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:28.940
 Yeah, apart from abstract ones.

00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:32.940
 Oh God, I mean, yeah, but the sea battle ones that were showing, you know,

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:36.940
 that wasn't someone while everyone was falling out of their boats and everything was on fire.

00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:38.940
 Sorry, can you just hold it for one minute?

00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:40.940
 Stop! Moving!

00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:43.940
 The panoramas in general, they became huge.

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:46.940
 So Barker started this trade. He really quickly had imitators.

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:48.940
 He trademarked it, didn't he?

00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:50.940
 He tried to make sure that that was his invention.

00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:52.940
 But then it ran out after about a decade.

00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:55.940
 And so then it was a complete free for all the panoramas everywhere.

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:59.940
 And then in 1831 in Paris, which was about the Battle of Navarino, a naval battle,

00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:03.940
 and the producer, this is so cool, he was called Charles Longlois,

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:06.940
 and he replaced the normal viewing platform that everyone would stand on in the middle

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:09.940
 and look around at the picture with the poop deck of a ship

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:12.940
 which had taken part in the Battle of Navarino.

00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:14.940
 - Nice. - Ultra realistic.

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:17.940
 He had a ventilation to give a sea breeze,

00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:22.940
 and he did all of this clever stuff to make it feel incredibly accurate.

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:25.940
 The poop deck, of course, covered in channel changers, wasn't it?

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:27.940
 Yeah.

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:30.940
 We covered very slightly ages ago about Banvard,

00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:32.940
 and that brilliant book, Banvard's Folly,

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:35.940
 which we always get asked about from listeners.

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:39.940
 But what that was was those turnstile panoramas

00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:42.940
 where it was basically a movie wrapped up,

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:45.940
 and you would turn it, and it would be a moving,

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:48.940
 as if you were on a train and the view was passing you by,

00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:51.940
 the painting would pass you by, and they would have sound,

00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:55.940
 they would have smells, kind of like what you're saying with the other immersive thing,

00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:58.940
 and you would watch that like a movie, which is amazing,

00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:00.940
 and Banvard had one which was the Mississippi Valley,

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:04.940
 and it was a three-mile canvas, three-mile-long canvas, he called it.

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:07.940
 It was actually half a mile, when people probably looked into it.

00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:12.940
 But all of this, which feels like it's such a shame that we don't have this anymore,

00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:17.940
 these panoramic retundas, I think they'd be beautiful to go into.

00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:19.940
 It was cinema that killed it.

00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:23.940
 And when cinema arrived, that just no one was interested anymore in seeing these things.

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:25.940
 But the panoramas, I don't know, they were still going

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:28.940
 at the turn of the 20th century, they were still really popular.

00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:31.940
 They were still going, and basically the 1900 Grand Exhibition,

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:36.940
 which I think was in Paris, was the last, it was sort of the absolute apogee,

00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:39.940
 and the final grand hurrah of the panoramas.

00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:42.940
 I was reading a really great book called Panorama,

00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:48.940
 and it said that between 1870 and 1900, 100 million people around the world went to see panoramas.

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:52.940
 Although 100 million tickets were sold, maybe a lot of that was the same people, but huge claim.

00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:58.940
 Just on the kind of last hurrah of the panorama, the 1900 Grand Exhibition,

00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:02.940
 so they got really, really fancy, basically, they built and built and built,

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:05.940
 and there were all these, they were called Rama shows, so there was the Daya Rama,

00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:09.940
 there was the Alparama, the Cosmarama, Europarama, Neorama.

00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:11.940
 - Future Rama. - Yeah, it developed.

00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:15.940
 - Banana Rama. - In 1900, in the Grand Exhibition,

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:19.940
 this, oh, this sounds so good, the Mariorama.

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:28.940
 It's a bee, yeah, to find the princess, it was amazing.

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:32.940
 No, there was, so 700 people got on the platform,

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:38.940
 and then you would sail from Marseille to Yokohama, okay, a huge long voyage,

00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:44.940
 and I don't know how it revolved or moved around you, but that's mostly sea, I would think.

00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:47.940
 - It's all sea, oh yeah, sorry, it's complete sea voyage, but it was,

00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:50.940
 - It's quite an easy thing to paint, is what I'm saying, you're absolutely right.

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:54.940
 - Whoa, you're saying a bunch of sea is an easy thing to paint, are you joining Dan?

00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:58.940
 - Please write it. - And if you're an ocean painter.

00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:03.940
 - Turner, please get in touch. - No, you're right, sorry,

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:07.940
 there were big sites along the way of Naples, and the Suez Canal, and Sri Lanka,

00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:11.940
 and it sort of moved around you, and the, this is so cool,

00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:16.940
 it was blown through a layer of kelp to make it seem like the sea breeze was blowing around you.

00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:22.940
 - Just on vomiting and art, sickness and art, do you guys know Millie Brown?

00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:25.940
 - Doesn't sound familiar. - So she's friends with Lady Gaga,

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:30.940
 and so when she was 17 in the early 2000s, she was a young artist,

00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:33.940
 she went on stage in Berlin doing some performance art,

00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:38.940
 and she decided, hadn't tried it before, to try and vomit art onto a canvas,

00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:42.940
 and she lined up seven bottles of different coloured milk, dyed differently,

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:47.940
 and then the whole show is two hours of watching her throw it up.

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:52.940
 - I could have done that yesterday. - But no one would have paid to watch you.

00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:57.940
 - Well, that's the artificial barriers of the art world, frankly.

00:36:57.940 --> 00:37:00.940
 - Right. - Exactly, I often go to the tape mud and go,

00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:04.940
 "I could have done that." My five-year-old could have done that, I literally could.

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:08.940
 - She just goes to Leicester Square on a Saturday night, get the three Millie Brown show,

00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:10.940
 all sorts of colours. - Wow, so what did she manage to do?

00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:14.940
 Did she manage to do a nice picture of some flowers, or perhaps a portrait?

00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:20.940
 - It was a beautiful, sort of impressionist, water lilies, yeah, it was a vomity mess,

00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:22.940
 I suppose, but I'm sure it was very good.

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:26.940
 She said there was an old lady who was so moved that she left in tears.

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:31.940
 - Optical illusions? - Sure.

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:35.940
 - Just things that look different or make you feel weird.

00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:41.940
 So if you're a footballer and you score a goal, the next time you approach the goal,

00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:47.940
 you perceive it as bigger than it is, and if you take a shot on goal and you miss,

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:50.940
 the next time you perceive it as smaller.

00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:53.940
 - I watch a lot of basketball and you read about that a lot of players saying that

00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:59.940
 when they get on a run of three-pointers, the basket, the rim just feels like it's a bucket size,

00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:01.940
 like you just can't miss.

00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:04.940
 - Yeah, bucket size is actually smaller than a basketball ring.

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:06.940
 - Sorry? - I think we have the average bucket.

00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:08.940
 - Yeah, no good point on it. - Hang on, little garden bucket.

00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:11.940
 - I'm sorry, Anna, I think you're really knowledgeable about loads of stuff.

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:14.940
 I don't think you know the size of the average bucket on Earth.

00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:18.940
 - I'm watching, like, a metal bucket used for gardening.

00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:20.940
 - I think she's right, I think a rim is right.

00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:23.940
 - No, I'm thinking of a paint bucket, or a KFC bucket.

00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:25.940
 - Also small. - Definitely, yeah.

00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:27.940
 - That's small, that's small. - What's a bigger bucket?

00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:31.940
 - Well, an ice bucket for the ice bucket challenge, absolutely huge, can be.

00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:35.940
 - But that tended to just be a big, like, plastic box full of water used.

00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:38.940
 - Yeah, that's a laundry basket. - You're thinking of a barrel, I think.

00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:41.940
 - I think we're all making my case for meat, which is that a bucket is not a size.

00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:44.940
 - When you take your kids to the beach, do you just take a giant,

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:50.940
 just dunk them with this giant barrel size bucket, make a sandcastle, bitch?

00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:54.940
 - I read one last thing, this is quite rude, it's quite recent as well.

00:38:54.940 --> 00:39:00.940
 It's a news story, it's a guy who was, he was at an optical illusion show

00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:04.940
 with his girlfriend, and there was one room in it where you could do an illusion

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:06.940
 which made things look bigger, right?

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:09.940
 Now, he did what any funny young man would do.

00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:12.940
 - I've been in one of those rooms, I know what the one should mean.

00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:15.940
 The person goes in one corner and then another person stands in the other corner

00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:18.940
 and one of them looks like a giant and the other one looks tiny, right?

00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:22.940
 - And he, obviously, obviously, got his knob out and said,

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:25.940
 "Look, look how much bigger it is from here."

00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:27.940
 And his girlfriend said, "God, I can't take you anywhere."

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:28.940
 They were alone in the room.

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:31.940
 What he didn't realise was that the image was being projected onto a screen

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:34.940
 in another room next door, which was full of people.

00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:35.940
 - Oh no.

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:37.940
 - He was arrested for exposing himself.

00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:40.940
 - It feels, I mean, that kind of half there enough,

00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:42.940
 but on the other hand, they should have told him that it was being...

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:43.940
 - They should have told him.

00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:44.940
 - Definitely.

00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:47.940
 You've got to be told, if you think you're alone in a room, you can do any sort of thing.

00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:48.940
 - That's crazy.

00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:50.940
 - He was completely mortified, he was so worried about it for two years.

00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:53.940
 He has ended up being officially admonished.

00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:57.940
 - I think that actually women shouldn't be allowed to walk past that illusion

00:39:57.940 --> 00:39:59.940
 on a Saturday anyway.

00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:02.940
 - I think Woking Golf Club should actually install one of those mirrors

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:05.940
 in the changing room, so that's going to solve lots of issues.

00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:14.940
 - Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show, and that is James.

00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:17.940
 - Okay, my fact this week is that when hyenas hunt,

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:20.940
 they often go for low-hanging fruit.

00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:23.940
 They especially like buffalo testicles.

00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:25.940
 - Oh, buffaloes.

00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:29.940
 - It does not mean the buffalo is angry, and the buffalo is big.

00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:32.940
 - Sure, but hyenas are quick.

00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:33.940
 - Yeah, they are.

00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:34.940
 - Convicious.

00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:35.940
 - Then they've got hot chopped teeth.

00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:36.940
 - Yeah.

00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:41.940
 So hyenas are famous for being scavengers, I think, mostly.

00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:45.940
 But if you look into it, they are all-rounders, really.

00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:48.940
 They do scavenge sometimes, but they also hunt a lot,

00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:52.940
 and they especially hunt when they don't have anything to scavenge.

00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:58.940
 So there's been a thing recently in Kenya where there have been fewer lions around,

00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:04.940
 and because there are fewer lions, there's fewer dead animals for the hyenas to go after.

00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:08.940
 And because a hyena can't really chase a gazelle,

00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:12.940
 because they're not fast enough, it's hard for them to catch big animals.

00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:15.940
 They tend to go for things that are kind of easy for them to get.

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:20.940
 And according to this article I read, which was actually about the 2022 Kenyan election,

00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:23.940
 weirdly enough, in this article,

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:29.940
 they said that there is a thing where they've been found to be grabbing the balls of buffaloes.

00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:30.940
 - Oh, wow.

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:32.940
 - Is it kind of on the go, as in are they aiming to get the whole buffalo,

00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:35.940
 and they just settle for the balls, or is it just--

00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:39.940
 - I believe they go for a quick testicle and then they get--

00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:44.940
 - The thing is, their teeth are so sharp, they're so fast at eating as well,

00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:47.940
 they can just absolutely decimate their prey really quickly.

00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:51.940
 I imagine the buffaloes might not even notice to begin with.

00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:54.940
 Just to begin with, it's just so quick, it's just like, your balls are gone,

00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:58.940
 and then it's like a few minutes later, feels a bit looser, goosey down there, what's going on?

00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:00.940
 That is just such a precision cut.

00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:02.940
 - I-- - Nope, no one?

00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:07.940
 - If you're a buffalo, and you're a feeling sore, they're amazing though.

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:11.940
 So their teeth, properly, properly sharp, and this is the spotted hyena.

00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:15.940
 So we've got four species of hyena that are alive today.

00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:16.940
 We used to have a lot more.

00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:20.940
 In the fossil record, there was something like 70 different species of hyena.

00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:23.940
 They're even finding ones now that were sort of in the Arctic, North Canada,

00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:27.940
 where they didn't think they were before, they found teeth extracts and so on.

00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:30.940
 So we're finding more hyenas. - Probably bear balls.

00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:34.940
 - But their teeth are so strong, they can chew through the skulls of elephants.

00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:38.940
 And they can digest things in ways that most other animals can't.

00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:41.940
 So they can properly digest bone in the hyena.

00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:43.940
 - Yeah, they're the only things. - It's extraordinary.

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:46.940
 - Really, the only mammals that can digest bone are one of the only mammals.

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:48.940
 - Oh, wow. - But they're bone crunching,

00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:51.940
 and that's really good because it sort of recycles stuff on the savanna,

00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:54.940
 and it returns all those nutrients, all that good stuff in bone,

00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:58.940
 like phosphorus and calcium goes into the soil, and they have white poo.

00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:02.940
 So if you are looking around on the ground and you see some bright white poo,

00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:04.940
 likely to be a hyena around.

00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:07.940
 - Are they dangerous to humans? - They can hurt you.

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:09.940
 - You get your balls out.

00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:12.940
 - They sound like a buffalo. - Not without my mirror.

00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:15.940
 - You're an amusing optical illusion thing, I think that's really funny.

00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:18.940
 I just want to say, I find hyenas very gross, personally.

00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:21.940
 I know Anna... - Ooh, you're going to get letters.

00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:24.940
 - You're going to get letters from the... - They're sort of pretty mean customers,

00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:27.940
 and I know they have lots of good things about...

00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:30.940
 - What do you like about them? - Oh, they're all God's creatures.

00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:33.940
 - They're all God's creatures, but they just... - I know they look weird and ugly.

00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:36.940
 - They're that weird sloping shape. - They make a horrible laugh.

00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:40.940
 - They're in the Lion King, aren't they? - But they do make that horrible laugh.

00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:43.940
 - They're pretty... - And do you think they're kind of laughing at you?

00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:47.940
 - No, they never do whenever I'm here, and that's the annoying thing.

00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:50.940
 I've been banging out some great material for them.

00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:55.940
 - That solo show you took to the savanna was... - Have you ever gone to the zoo with Andy?

00:43:55.940 --> 00:44:01.940
 - I eat his abyss of themselves until Andy was passed and they go, "I prefer his old stuff."

00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:04.940
 - Obviously Andy's not alone and not liking hyenas,

00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:08.940
 and we've talked before about the Lion King effects, not helping their reputation as well.

00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:11.940
 - I like them. I'm going to put it out there. I like them.

00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:15.940
 - The kind of woke police comes along now.

00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:18.940
 - Wait, I thought you were saying you like them too, Anna?

00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:22.940
 - Yeah, I'm not going to make a big deal of it. - No, I'm not going to start an old campaign.

00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:27.940
 - That's what happens when you try to do something nice, Dad.

00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:30.940
 - You can't win here.

00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:36.940
 - The word "mafisi" means hyena in Swahili, but in Kenya, it's also an insult.

00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:39.940
 It's also slang. I think it means something like "shithead" or "shit friends" or something.

00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:42.940
 - It's so weird that the people who know most about hyenas would have a negative word,

00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:46.940
 which also means hyena. Wow, they're clearly misinformed, aren't they?

00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:49.940
 I hope you go over and do a re-education tour.

00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:55.940
 - There is something actually that they screw up for us, and that is if you are a paleoanthropologist.

00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:58.940
 So maybe you don't like them from this perspective.

00:44:58.940 --> 00:45:03.940
 Because this is people who are looking for evidence of hunter-gatherer humans,

00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:06.940
 ancient humans or proto-humans.

00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:10.940
 And sometimes it's really hard to tell if humans have been somewhere or if hyenas have been somewhere,

00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:14.940
 because they are the only two things that can break up bones.

00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:18.940
 And so you'll find piles of animal bones that have been shattered or mostly devoured,

00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:22.940
 and humans had stone tools with which they could smash up bones.

00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:24.940
 Hyenas obviously can just chew through them.

00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:28.940
 And they actually, scientists did an experiment to see how we can tell the difference.

00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:34.940
 And they fed some bones to hyenas, and they gave some bones to humans with a hammer,

00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:36.940
 hammer stones, and told them to smash them up.

00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:38.940
 And you can't really tell the difference.

00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:39.940
 - That's so interesting.

00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:44.940
 There is one interesting thing that hyenas can tell your paleo guys.

00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:50.940
 Angles, and that is that there might have been neanderthals nearby.

00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:54.940
 Because hyenas were kept by neanderthals as pets.

00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:59.940
 So in the same way that humans had dogs for various different things,

00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:06.940
 for partnership or hunting or whatever, then the neanderthals had hyenas.

00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:09.940
 And the thing is that hyena is a type of cat.

00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:12.940
 But it really fills in the niche of a dog.

00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:15.940
 If you didn't know, you would think it was kind of a dog.

00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:18.940
 And it could be that that's why they exist even,

00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:21.940
 because they're basically the neanderthal dog.

00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:25.940
 And then the neanderthals died out, but then the hyenas are still here.

00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:30.940
 - And that's why they really miss their owners, which is why they're so bad.

00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:32.940
 - I bet they ate their owners.

00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:37.940
 That's why the neanderthals died out, actually, was because they had such incredibly unfriendly dogs.

00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:43.940
 - It's funny you say that there was a find, I think, last year in a cave in Spain of neanderthal bones,

00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:45.940
 and they think they were eaten by hyenas.

00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:47.940
 - They might have sometimes turned on them.

00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:51.940
 - They're just animals, they're just doing what they do, but they're unfriendly.

00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:53.940
 They're not well-exposed to us.

00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:55.940
 - They sort of arrive unfriendly as well, don't they?

00:46:55.940 --> 00:47:00.940
 So hyenas, it's dominated by the females, their societies.

00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:04.940
 And when the mother is pregnant, in the later stages of pregnancy,

00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:09.940
 there's a moment where sort of a lot of testosterone is released into the womb,

00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:14.940
 and they basically just soak in it like a bath for the final stages of the pregnancy.

00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:21.940
 And then when they come out, it's usually the female hyenas who really get more of this testosterone in them

00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:24.940
 than the male hyenas, the boy hyenas that are coming out.

00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:27.940
 And so the females are furious.

00:47:27.940 --> 00:47:30.940
 They're in there, the testosterone is going crazy in them.

00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:33.940
 Their teeth are ready, they get born with their eyes open, and they're just ready to fight.

00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:38.940
 And if the litter that the hyena has, if that's the correct term, is two girls, let's say,

00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:42.940
 then those two will immediately see some food and just try and kill each other

00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:44.940
 to make sure that they're the one who gets the dinner.

00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:47.940
 Whereas if a boy comes out with a girl, then there's no fighting,

00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:51.940
 because the boy's like, "I'm not touching you, you're vicious, you're crazy."

00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:54.940
 - These are Lion King ones.

00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:58.940
 The ones that were animated in the Lion King, they were based on some real hyenas.

00:47:58.940 --> 00:48:01.940
 I mean, obviously they're based on hyenas, but in fact, we know specifically

00:48:01.940 --> 00:48:03.940
 which hyenas they were based on.

00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:06.940
 And these are the hyenas from Berkeley, California.

00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:08.940
 And it's a classic Hollywood.

00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:12.940
 - I was going to say, do you think they go back to their pack and they're sort of,

00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:16.940
 "Oh, well, I'm the famous hyena." But if they're already living in Berkeley, then...

00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:19.940
 - They're already completely out of themselves. They've all been in something.

00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:21.940
 Yeah, they're on the bone smoothies.

00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:24.940
 There was this research centre in Berkeley which had 30 hyenas living in it,

00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:27.940
 and they were being studied by brilliant research scientists.

00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:30.940
 And I read a great piece all about this research centre.

00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:33.940
 One of the keepers of the hyenas who was interviewed in this article,

00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:35.940
 she was called Mary Weldella.

00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:37.940
 I don't know if I'm pronouncing it right, I'm sure I'm not.

00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:41.940
 But when the guy who's writing the piece goes and speaks to her,

00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:44.940
 he notices that Mary had a very, really peculiar thumb.

00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:47.940
 And you know why she had such a peculiar thumb?

00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:50.940
 - Well, she part hyena, a very small part hyena.

00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:51.940
 - Exactly right.

00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:54.940
 - She traps it in a door.

00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:57.940
 - It's more related to what I was trying to say.

00:48:57.940 --> 00:49:00.940
 - She had a very peculiar looking thumb.

00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:02.940
 - Had it been eaten by a hyena.

00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:03.940
 - It was her big toe.

00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:06.940
 And the reason was because her original thumb had been bitten off by a hyena.

00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:08.940
 And so they had to replace it with her big toe.

00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:10.940
 - Well, I bet she aggravated that.

00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:12.940
 I bet she gave it a thumbs down for something.

00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:16.940
 We've said there are four, you said Dan, there are four species of hyena.

00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:17.940
 - I did.

00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:20.940
 - And yeah, you say that they are more closely related to cats than to dogs.

00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:24.940
 But they're actually just their own, they're not even their own species.

00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:25.940
 They're their own family.

00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:26.940
 They're so different to anything else.

00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:30.940
 And each hyena species is in its own genus.

00:49:30.940 --> 00:49:33.940
 I think the spotted hyenas get all the most press.

00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:35.940
 And they are the ones who do the most hunting.

00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:37.940
 So actually they hunt most of the food.

00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:42.940
 They actually get more of their kills stolen by lions than the other way around.

00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:43.940
 - How do they?

00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:48.940
 - But my favorite hyenas are odd wolves, which get not that much press.

00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:52.940
 And odd wolves are the fourth species, which only eat insects.

00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:56.940
 And they're quite slow and quite crap at fighting.

00:49:56.940 --> 00:49:58.940
 - They only eat the testicles of ants.

00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:00.940
 - They're able to get down really low.

00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:02.940
 They're very good at limbo.

00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:04.940
 - God, I've heard of an odd wolf, but I did not know it was a kind of hyena.

00:50:04.940 --> 00:50:05.940
 - No, I didn't either.

00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:08.940
 - And now I've gone right off them.

00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:15.940
 - Well, bad news, Andy, because I know you don't want hyenas strolling the streets of Britain.

00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:20.940
 But, and they can't, according to the Dangerous Wild Animals Act of 1976.

00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:25.940
 You're not allowed to have a pet hyena, but you are allowed to have a pet odd wolf.

00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:26.940
 - Wow.

00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:31.940
 - Specifically in the lore, it says all hyenas are banned except for the odd wolf.

00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:32.940
 - No way.

00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:33.940
 - Wow.

00:50:33.940 --> 00:50:35.940
 - Well, because all they do is eat termites.

00:50:35.940 --> 00:50:37.940
 - Have you guys seen a photo of one?

00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:38.940
 Did they look like a hyena?

00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:39.940
 - Yeah.

00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:40.940
 - Are they sort of indistinguishable?

00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:41.940
 Same height, same size?

00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:44.940
 - Yeah, I would say they look, all four species look a bit different,

00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:46.940
 but very similar to each other.

00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:49.940
 - But they have like really long tongues, like an odd bark.

00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:50.940
 - All four, for instance.

00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:51.940
 - Yeah.

00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:53.940
 Basically, they're only way of defending themselves.

00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:56.940
 One of the only ways is they secrete this substance from the anal glands,

00:50:56.940 --> 00:50:58.940
 which is really disgusting.

00:50:58.940 --> 00:50:59.940
 And actually, we don't know.

00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:02.940
 It could be defense, or it could be to mark their territory

00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:04.940
 or tell other hyenas where they are.

00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:08.940
 And according to, there was a book on African mammals I was reading,

00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:12.940
 which explained how they wipe their substances on the ground.

00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:16.940
 And they straddle a grass stalk, and then they rapidly squat,

00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:20.940
 I think, up and down on this grass stalk while inverting their anal pouch.

00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:22.940
 And it wipes this smear.

00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:26.940
 So you know if they've been around, you can see a little smear of their presence.

00:51:26.940 --> 00:51:29.940
 Do you know the hyena men in Nigeria?

00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:30.940
 - No.

00:51:30.940 --> 00:51:34.940
 - These are traditional storytellers, but their main trick seems to be,

00:51:34.940 --> 00:51:36.940
 there are a few of them there, itinerant.

00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:38.940
 They never stay in one place more than a couple of days.

00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:43.940
 And the main thing is they have sort of pet hyenas.

00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:47.940
 And their job, I think, is to sell kind of powders and potions

00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:50.940
 that can, you know, cure you of things.

00:51:50.940 --> 00:51:51.940
 And they have these pet hyenas.

00:51:51.940 --> 00:51:53.940
 And what they do is they beat drums to attract crowds,

00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:54.940
 and then the crowds come.

00:51:54.940 --> 00:51:58.940
 And then they put their arms and their heads inside hyena's jaws.

00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:01.940
 And so, look, I didn't bite my head off.

00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:03.940
 And that's because I've used this powder.

00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:06.940
 Why don't you buy some powder that won't bite your head off?

00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:07.940
 - What is the reason?

00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:09.940
 They've just domesticated the hyenas.

00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:11.940
 - Yeah, or maybe sometimes they do bite their heads off,

00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:12.940
 and they don't hear about those hyenas.

00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:13.940
 - Or it's an art wolf.

00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:14.940
 - Or it's not.

00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:16.940
 - It's just dressed as a hyena, yeah.

00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:19.940
 - It just licks inside your ear while it's long time.

00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:21.940
 - Wow, that's great.

00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:27.940
 Hyenas go on a diet during Lent in Ethiopia, specifically.

00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:29.940
 - That's amazing.

00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:33.940
 - Is it a Catholic country?

00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:34.940
 - It's very Christian.

00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:35.940
 - It's very Christian, yeah, sorry.

00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:38.940
 - In Ethiopia, there's constant fasting in the Christian community.

00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:39.940
 - Yeah, I really do.

00:52:39.940 --> 00:52:40.940
 - So I guess they're subscribing to that.

00:52:40.940 --> 00:52:43.940
 - Well, this was, again, a study done by a scientist

00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:48.940
 called Gaidi Yerga and colleagues who analysed 553 hyena scats

00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:52.940
 before, during and after the period of Lent in Ethiopia.

00:52:52.940 --> 00:52:56.940
 And what they found is that basically during Lent,

00:52:56.940 --> 00:52:58.940
 the butchers aren't selling meat

00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:00.940
 because people aren't eating meat as much, right?

00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:02.940
 So that's a problem.

00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:04.940
 Hyenas don't have as much scavenging to do.

00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:06.940
 So they hunt donkeys instead.

00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:08.940
 - All right, they don't say, oh, you know what?

00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:13.940
 I'm going to give up buffalo testicles just for the 40 days.

00:53:13.940 --> 00:53:15.940
 - Quite the reverse.

00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:18.940
 It's really bad to be a donkey during Lent in Ethiopia

00:53:18.940 --> 00:53:20.940
 because the odds of you being eaten by a hyena are rocket.

00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:21.940
 - Right.

00:53:21.940 --> 00:53:23.940
 - And they basically analysed all the hyena feces

00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:26.940
 and they found that donkey hair proportion in the feces

00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:30.940
 shoots up more than doubles during the Lenten period.

00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:32.940
 - That's a real stab in the face, isn't it?

00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:35.940
 Because as the creature that brought the Virgin Mary

00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:39.940
 into Bethlehem to give birth to Christ our savior.

00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:41.940
 - And took Christ into the...

00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:43.940
 - On Palm Sunday, wasn't he?

00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:45.940
 - When he arrived on a donkey, yeah, yeah.

00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:47.940
 - Well, and you're the one who's getting punished

00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:49.940
 at Lent of all times.

00:53:49.940 --> 00:53:50.940
 - There's irony.

00:53:50.940 --> 00:53:51.940
 - There's irony.

00:53:51.940 --> 00:53:53.940
 - No, one of those bloody gloomy all the time.

00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:57.940
 - That's what E.R. is thinking about.

00:53:57.940 --> 00:54:00.940
 - I missed that bit of the hundred acre one

00:54:00.940 --> 00:54:02.940
 that E.R. gets eaten by a hyena.

00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:05.940
 (upbeat music)

00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:08.940
 - Okay, that's it.

00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:09.940
 That is all of our facts.

00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:10.940

 where all the fans get together

00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:43.940
 and chat about their favorite things.

00:54:43.940 --> 00:54:44.940
