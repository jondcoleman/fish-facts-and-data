00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:06,120
 Hi everybody, just before we start this week's show, we have an exciting announcement to make.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,860
 And that is that the National Comedy Awards are coming up very soon.

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:18,400
 And the great mothership that is QI and the mother herself that is Sandy Toxfig.

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,220
 How creepy, I don't know how she'd feel about me calling her my mother.

6
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:25,900
 But that is Sandy Toxfig are both up for awards.

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,120
 That's absolutely right.

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:33,400
 QI is nominated for Best Comedy Panel Show and Sandy, or Mummy as I call her, has been

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:38,120
 shortlisted for Outstanding Female Comedy Entertainment Performance.

10
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,800
 We think that both are deserving winners, so if you would like to go and vote for QI or

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,800
 for Sandy in those awards, go to qi.com/vote.

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,560
 So easy to do and so important that you get your vote in and help us destroy all comedy

13
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,360
 competition, which as we all know, is the point of comedy.

14
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,480
 Yes, exactly, flatten all that comedy.

15
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,660
 And if you do want to remind yourself why they're the best, all of QI is now available

16
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:06,560
 on BBC iPlayer, go and watch a few episodes and convince yourself that they both deserve

17
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,560
 to win.

18
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,560
 That's qi.com/vote.

19
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,560
 Do it now.

20
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,560
 On with the show.

21
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,560
 On with the show.

22
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:33,320
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

23
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,120
 to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

24
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,200
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, Anna Tyshinski

25
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,320
 and James Harkin, and once again we have gathered round the microphones with our four favourite

26
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,480
 facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

27
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,880
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Anna.

28
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,040
 My fact this week is that the first female composer to become a dame used to tie herself

29
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,920
 to trees to improve her posture.

30
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,600
 I have a question.

31
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,520
 Was her posture originally too bent so she stood next to a tall tree or was it originally

32
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,640
 too straight as she stood next to like a weeping willow or something to bend herself over?

33
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,200
 Tied herself to one of those really droopy branches.

34
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,560
 I believe it was to the trunk.

35
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,400
 She didn't specify, I think she left it for us to assume.

36
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,400
 This was an amazing woman called Ethel Smyth.

37
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,560
 She was writing music and conducting and creating, you know, operas and all sorts of classical

38
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,800
 music at the turn of the 20th century, and there's a new book coming out which covers

39
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,800
 her life.

40
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,520
 It's going to be called Quartet.

41
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:45,120
 Sounds great coming out in spring by someone called Dr Lea Broad, and she read an account

42
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,400
 of an interviewer who went to meet Ethel Smyth at one point to interview her about her music

43
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:55,720
 making, and she found that she was tied to a tree and specifically to improve her posture

44
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,720
 as a conductor.

45
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,720
 Oh, come on.

46
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,720
 No.

47
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,720
 Something went wrong.

48
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,160
 Some sort of weird sex game went wrong.

49
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,160
 The interviewer.

50
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,160
 What are you doing?

51
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,160
 Oh, no.

52
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,160
 It's for the old conducting.

53
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,160
 You're so right.

54
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,160
 Come on.

55
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,880
 It's actually sort of a sex minx, so I reckon it was that.

56
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,880
 Yeah.

57
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,840
 Yeah, but you can't admit that to the interviewer first thing, can you?

58
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,320
 And then you have to just carry that on for the rest of your career.

59
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:22,040
 You just go to people that sort of recommending trees, you know, you've got a big pot plant

60
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,720
 with a thick trunk there in the orchestra pit tied to it mid show, which is what you

61
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,720
 should do.

62
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,720
 She's amazing.

63
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,720
 Yeah.

64
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,720
 She is incredible.

65
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,560
 So, she was very successful in her time given how unlikely it was for a woman to be

66
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,200
 successful in composing writing music.

67
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,520
 What was her time specifically?

68
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,600
 She was born in 1858.

69
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,600
 She died in 1944.

70
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,600
 Yeah.

71
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:48,000
 And a lot of her most famous works will have been around the 1880s, 1890s and the early

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 1900s.

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 Yeah.

74
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 And she was prolific.

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 She wrote so much.

76
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,480
 She wrote six operas, which operas are a big feat.

77
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,200
 And it plus loads of chamber music and orchestra and stuff.

78
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,720
 She played for Queen Victoria and for Edward VII.

79
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,600
 And she was so ambitious that we know that she kept a diary throughout her childhood

80
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,720
 and she wrote in her diary, age eight, that she intended to be made a peer because of

81
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,720
 her musical prowess.

82
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,720
 And lo and behold.

83
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,720
 She was.

84
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,720
 And she was.

85
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,720
 Yeah.

86
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,720
 That's amazing.

87
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,720
 It's good to have something to aim for, isn't it?

88
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,720
 Yeah.

89
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,280
 Because actually, when she was a child, I read that she was quite good at sports.

90
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,920
 This was on the Surrey Government website and it said, "From the beginning, when she was

91
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,800
 a child, she won a bet for riding a pig and to the end of her long life, she was a keen

92
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,800
 sportswoman."

93
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,800
 Really?

94
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,280
 So, yeah, that shows how keen you are at sports.

95
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,280
 She was.

96
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,280
 She definitely won lots of contests.

97
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:43,800
 And in lots of different sports, I think she was very vigorous, picture like a good mistrunchable

98
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,800
 maybe.

99
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,080
 So, she did like mountaineering, tennis, hunting, cycling, golf.

100
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,080
 Golf.

101
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,080
 Golf.

102
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,080
 Yes.

103
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,080
 Very keen on golf.

104
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,080
 James, she did do golf.

105
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,080
 Yeah.

106
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,080
 I must admit, most of my facts are about walking golf club.

107
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,080
 Oh!

108
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,080
 Golf.

109
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,000
 So, here is the thing why James actually might theoretically have a point dragging us into

110
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,600
 the golfing world is that I was looking up her Dame Hood, which was 1923, the Honours

111
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,600
 List then, and she was convinced it was because she was a member of the Woking Golf Club.

112
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,600
 Oh!

113
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,600
 Really?

114
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,600
 Okay.

115
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,560
 She had friends in high places, kissing some ass, where it matters.

116
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,560
 Oh, wow.

117
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:23,440
 Well, it was owned by a guy called Lord Riddell, who was a bigwig, a bit senior lawyer and

118
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,680
 a newspaper proprietor and all that sort of stuff, and he was a member of the club and

119
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,700
 so was she.

120
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:37,120
 And there was a big dispute about the changing rooms, where the women members wanted to walk

121
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,240
 across a shortcut, a short route.

122
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,240
 What?

123
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,240
 I know.

124
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,320
 And it took them past the men's changing rooms to get to the women's rooms.

125
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,320
 Nightmare.

126
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,520
 And the men were very uncomfortable about this.

127
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,760
 The women walking past the changing rooms, I'm not sure if the men's changing rooms

128
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,560
 were just sheet glass in the windows or something like that, but I don't think they would have

129
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,560
 seen anything.

130
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,200
 But also, it's not like a swimming pool.

131
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,720
 It's not like you have to take your kit off completely to put your golf shoes on.

132
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,720
 You're absolutely right.

133
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,720
 What?

134
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,720
 What are they doing there?

135
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,720
 Well, anyway.

136
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,720
 What do men do in changing rooms, actually?

137
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,000
 Suddenly, it's way more suspicious for them to kick up this big fuss.

138
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 You're right.

139
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,400
 I don't know, but James, you presumably spend a lot of time in those...

140
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,400
 You might have a shower.

141
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,400
 Oh, there we go.

142
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,520
 So, basically, the men were uncomfortable about this situation with the women walking

143
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,480
 near their changing rooms, and they demanded that the women be banned from playing golf

144
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,240
 for weekends as a sort of proportional response.

145
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,380
 And Smythe actually told the ladies' committee, "Look, let's give the men a slightly easier

146
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,540
 ride on this one.

147
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:34,000
 Maybe they're just incredibly modest, and they're worried about it."

148
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,600
 And the sort of militant women, almost all of them, abandoned this shortcut route.

149
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,560
 So, she basically sold out the sisterhood and gave the men at the golf club a slightly

150
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,960
 easier time, and she thinks that because Lord Riddell was maybe friends with the PM, he might

151
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,200
 have said, "Look, we should make this woman a Dave."

152
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,720
 Lord Riddell had a particularly tiny penis in him, so relieved.

153
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,880
 It's a particularly dangerous place to tie yourself to trees, as well, a golf course.

154
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,880
 Yeah.

155
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,240
 Certainly if I'm playing golf, you'd know I'd be tired of any trees near me.

156
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,240
 She...

157
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,040
 When I read her story, I've never heard of her before, but she just...

158
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,520
 It's begging for a movie to be made about her life.

159
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,600
 She was a suffragette.

160
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:15,160
 She played a big role in composing songs for the suffragettes, but she also had rumors

161
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,680
 of affairs going on with people like Emmeline Panchurst and...

162
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,680
 Everybody.

163
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,680
 And Virginia Woolf.

164
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,800
 Although, these are all kind of rumors, and I think Virginia Woolf was the one who started

165
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,960
 the Panchurst rumor, suggesting that they were lovers, but she spent time in jail for

166
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,280
 throwing stones.

167
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,280
 She was just...

168
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,760
 She was a badass, basically.

169
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,960
 I think she was in love with both of those two people.

170
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,800
 I think she was a woman who fell in love quite a lot.

171
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,840
 You get the impression, and it was sometimes reciprocated and sometimes not.

172
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,880
 I mean, Virginia Woolf wrote when Ethel fell in love with her.

173
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:48,520
 She wrote in her diary, I think, "An old woman has fallen in love with me.

174
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,520
 It's like being caught by a giant crab."

175
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,520
 Oh.

176
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,520
 Which is not what you want, is it?

177
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,520
 No, not really.

178
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,520
 You don't say "yes" to that.

179
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,520
 No.

180
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,520
 It just comes at you sideways.

181
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,520
 Exciting.

182
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,520
 Founces.

183
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,800
 We should talk about the thing which landed her in prison, because this was a brilliant

184
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,800
 incident.

185
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,680
 It was in 1912, and the really cool thing is you could hear her talking about it.

186
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,720
 There was a recording made before she died, but she was saying at 5.30pm, one evening in

187
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,360
 1912, relays of women produced from their muffs and handbags, hammers and things like

188
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,200
 that, and proceeded to methodically smash up windows in all the big London thoroughfares.

189
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,480
 And Mrs. Pankhurst was the one who kind of opened the bowling on that occasion, so she

190
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:31,360
 threw a stone at 10 Downing Street, and then simultaneously, all over London, suffragettes

191
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,120
 and suffragettes were throwing stones at various buildings, and she was one of them.

192
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,440
 So she went to the house of someone called Lord Harcourt, who had annoyed her, and she

193
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,440
 got to the Target Square.

194
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,720
 There was a policeman standing around, and she said, "Whose house is that?

195
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,720
 What about that one?"

196
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,320
 He threw a stone through the window of Lord Harcourt, and he says, "Will you come quietly?"

197
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,320
 And she said, "Yes."

198
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,080
 And then he arrested her, and she went off to prison.

199
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,080
 That was it.

200
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,080
 That was the protest.

201
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,080
 That's cool.

202
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,400
 Virginia Woolf said that she was the first ever woman to write an opera, and she was

203
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,680
 wrong about that, because the first woman to write an opera was someone called Francesca

204
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:12,080
 Caccini, and there was about 250 years before Ethel Smythe came along.

205
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,520
 And Caccini, she was amazing.

206
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:19,120
 She sang at the wedding of Henry IV of France, and he was so impressed by her singing that

207
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:25,760
 he asked her to stay in his court, and by the time of the 1620s or the top of her career,

208
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:31,120
 she was the highest-paid musician in the court by this woman, and her opera, which was the

209
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:37,760
 first written by a woman, this is called La Liberazione di Ruggero, and it was so good

210
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,960
 that the King of Poland heard it, and he rushed all the way back to Poland and created his

211
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,320
 own opera house just so that he could get someone to play this opera in it.

212
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,320
 Wow.

213
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,480
 It was such a hassle before, Gramophones or CD Plays.

214
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,480
 Spotify.

215
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,480
 Yeah, yeah.

216
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,980
 Had to build a bloody opera house.

217
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,920
 To be fair to Virginia Woolf, no internet for her.

218
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,360
 No, she couldn't Google it, could she?

219
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,360
 We had to make a guess.

220
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,120
 Do you know we have mentioned Ethel Smythe on this podcast before, but without knowing

221
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,120
 it.

222
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,120
 Oh.

223
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,120
 Dun, dun, dun.

224
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:13,800
 So, do you remember listeners at home, and you guys, you know the Bishop of Truro, Edward

225
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,280
 White-Benson, who invented the carol concert, the Christmas carol concert.

226
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,960
 We talked about him because he had this amazing family.

227
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:28,920
 His wife was gay and kept a diary of her 39 lesbian lovers, and had lots of affairs,

228
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,320
 and we mentioned that his wife was going out with this particular woman, who was then stolen

229
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,880
 by his daughter, and it was this raunchy love triangle where mother and daughter were fighting,

230
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,120
 and that was Ethel.

231
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,120
 Wow.

232
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,120
 That's it.

233
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,120
 Yeah.

234
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,800
 It's obviously a different world now for composers, female composers, but survey was

235
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,560
 done in 2020 to see on an average year, how many orchestral concerts worldwide were playing

236
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,000
 music that was composed by women.

237
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,520
 So in percentage terms, what do you reckon it would be?

238
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,200
 Oh, they're still really low.

239
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,200
 Miniscule, I should think.

240
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:07,480
 Yeah, so they surveyed 15 orchestras worldwide, who did more than 1,500 concerts, and did

241
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,680
 4,000 pieces, and what it comes out is 8.2%.

242
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,680
 So only 142 of the pieces were composed by women, which is not much more than it was

243
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:23,360
 in her day, according to this stat from Don, D-O-N-N-E, which is women.

244
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,360
 Don.

245
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,880
 Your mate Don, Don the dog, I've met him, yeah.

246
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,880
 Yeah, Don.

247
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,880
 I don't know if he's reliable.

248
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,200
 Don my research for me this week.

249
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,840
 It's a women in music charity foundation, and they did this as a big global survey to

250
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,840
 find out.

251
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:41,160
 So it's that song about him, isn't it, Don, D-O-N-D-O-N.

252
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:46,720
 The problem is, I suppose, is that orchestras tend to play classical music, and it is all

253
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,880
 from the past, and almost all past composers were men, so it's so hard to sort of create

254
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,360
 a female composer from the 1800s.

255
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:59,200
 But certainly there should be more contemporary ones, which still are.

256
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,680
 Just one more thing about Smythe, she wants kidnapped her own opera.

257
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,680
 Oh, yes.

258
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,680
 Mid-show.

259
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,400
 This is so cool.

260
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:11,800
 It was in Leipzig in 1906, her opera The Wreckers had its debut, which is about a load of people

261
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,640
 who wreck ships.

262
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:18,380
 She found out there had been edits made, which was absolutely furious.

263
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:23,120
 She found some cuts had been made to the third act, and she walked into the orchestra pit.

264
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,160
 She took the parts off the musicians, and she took the score with her, and she went to

265
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:32,400
 Prague, where she thought she'd get a fairer hearing and get a played in full.

266
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,400
 The nuts move.

267
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,480
 For someone who's achieved what no one could have really dreamed a woman would achieve

268
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,000
 at that time, God, they're putting it on in Leipzig.

269
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,560
 It got standing ovation, huge deal.

270
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,360
 She storms off in a strop with all the stuff they need to play it.

271
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:49,320
 I just find it so funny, though, that how vulnerable are classical musicians that, when

272
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,320
 the paper's taken away, well, that's it.

273
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,560
 We can't do anything.

274
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,400
 We can't remember the chords like any other song.

275
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,400
 What could you do?

276
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,400
 It's a long, it's a long song.

277
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,400
 It's not a Westlife song.

278
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,400
 Opras are long.

279
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,400
 Opras are long.

280
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,240
 Oh, if you're playing a violin, you can memorize.

281
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,240
 You can memorize a piece.

282
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,240
 Dude.

283
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,240
 No, they've just seen this piece.

284
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,600
 I think that, you know.

285
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,320
 Bands play for three hours.

286
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,920
 It's the same chords, guys.

287
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,920
 It's the same instruments.

288
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,920
 Everyone!

289
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,920
 There's no extra chords.

290
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,920
 LA.

291
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,920
 Everyone.

292
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,920
 Play LA.

293
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,920
 Right?

294
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,920
 No, everyone.

295
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,920
 LA.

296
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,760
 There's no extra notes that classical people have that coldplay don't have.

297
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,760
 But sometimes.

298
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,560
 And if you're a classical musician, if you're a classical bassoonist and you think that what

299
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:33,440
 you do is no more difficult than a rudimentary coldplay song, please write to Dan, podcast

300
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,440
 at qi.com.

301
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,440
 Yeah.

302
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,440
 Yeah.

303
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,440
 We crave to hear from you.

304
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,440
 Let me hear.

305
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,440
 Okay.

306
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,440
 You're telling me.

307
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,440
 Let the bassoon meet the buffoon.

308
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,720
 Bruce Springsteen does five hour gigs.

309
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,220
 You're telling me you're better than him?

310
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,220
 Bassoon boy?

311
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,220
 He's been playing.

312
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,220
 Oh my gosh.

313
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:52,000
 And also, yeah, he's been playing the same tunes for 150 years.

314
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,920
 He hasn't seen, I've got a three hour opera put in front of him two days ago.

315
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,280
 He's like, bloody hell, rehearse this and then you're going to play it in two nights.

316
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,280
 It's like a panic dream for any normal human being.

317
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,800
 Dan, he wouldn't have got it first time, a quick glance.

318
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,800
 Nailed it.

319
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,800
 Got it.

320
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,800
 Tears up the paper.

321
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,800
 No, no, no.

322
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,800
 Forget that.

323
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,800
 How do you forget that?

324
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,800
 No, no, no, no.

325
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,800
 Thank you and good night.

326
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,800
 Good night, Vienna.

327
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,800
 Okay.

328
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:24,320
 It is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

329
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:32,840
 My fact is that TV screens are cut from a massive TV screen called the mother glass.

330
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,840
 The mother glass.

331
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,480
 The mother glass itself, does it work as an enormous TV screen?

332
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,800
 I imagine it would do.

333
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,800
 Oh, cool.

334
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,680
 But it's so big that I don't think they've made the TV big enough.

335
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,600
 You wouldn't be able to get out the factory, would you?

336
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,600
 I should say where this comes from.

337
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:51,800
 This comes from a brilliant Atlantic piece about TV tech and the main focus of it was

338
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,000
 that actually the TVs are so cheap.

339
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,280
 TVs are way cheaper than they used to be, and there are various reasons for that.

340
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:02,480
 One is that LED panels, which are now the main ingredient in TV, they're much cheaper,

341
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,840
 and another reason is the mother glass because manufacturers are way better these days at

342
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,880
 cutting screens out of the mother glass, so there's much less wastage, and so that's

343
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,960
 part of the reason why TVs are so much cheaper.

344
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,160
 So how do you make mother glass?

345
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:21,280
 It's basically the glass, so this is, we're talking about LCD screens, aren't we, which

346
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:25,800
 are basically what your TV screen property is today, and you've got your two thin sheets

347
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,840
 of glass sandwiched together.

348
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,400
 I think in between the two thin sheets of glass, there's like a liquid crystal thing

349
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,840
 which acts as the conductor, and so you just have this huge sheet of that glass, and I

350
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:42,600
 think each sheet can be dozens of feet, the mother glass, and so you can cut, you know,

351
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,080
 10, 10, 15 TVs out of that.

352
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:48,800
 And how they make glass, I don't know if they still do it this way, but I think they

353
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,800
 do.

354
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,800
 It's basically float glass.

355
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,640
 So float glass was invented in the 50s in St. Helens, near where I'm from, and the idea

356
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:00,560
 is it was really hard to make flat glass in those days, but what they worked out is you

357
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:05,880
 could put a load of glass on a load of molten tin, so you melt a load of tin to a really

358
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:10,040
 high temperature, and then you put the glass on it, and it sits perfectly on top of it,

359
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:15,440
 like if you pour oil on water, it would just be a small film of it, and then when the tin

360
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,760
 and the glass cools down, you can just sort of peel it off, and it'll be a really flat

361
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:24,360
 piece of glass, and I think that's still how they make flat glass, so it certainly was

362
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,360
 10 years ago.

363
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,360
 That's amazing.

364
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,040
 You know, researching this fact, I just came across so much new vocab.

365
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,040
 It was great.

366
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,240
 It was like researching a foreign language.

367
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,960
 Well, you don't watch much TV, do you, Hannah?

368
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,320
 That's true, so.

369
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,140
 So there's a fab.

370
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:43,440
 Fabs are constantly referred to when you're talking about, like, high-end technological

371
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,120
 production, and these are factories in China.

372
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,000
 It's short for fabrication plants, and no one ever explains what they are, because they

373
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,160
 assume if you're reading these articles, you definitely know what a fab is, so all of these

374
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,160
 screens are made in fabs.

375
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:59,600
 Apparently, you can spot an LCD screen-making fab, because they'll be very tall.

376
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,200
 They'll go up many, many stories, and they will hoist the equipment up the outside, so

377
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,600
 they have big windows on the outside where they hoist the equipment up, and then they

378
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,440
 just hoist it in to where they need it.

379
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:16,040
 Everyone in there looks like they're in hazmat suits or Ebola fighters, because they have

380
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:20,080
 to have what you call clean rooms, because it's so fine.

381
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:24,440
 You're working with, like, atomic-level stuff, and when you're making these very specialized

382
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,400
 screens, you can't get a single speck of dust.

383
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:34,240
 So the rooms have to be what you call a class 10 clean room, or even a class 1 clean room,

384
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:41,000
 and what that means is that you have to have fewer than one particle smaller than 0.3 microns

385
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,180
 in diameter per cubic meter of air.

386
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:47,840
 So for comparison, so that's class 1.

387
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,000
 So who was that the best?

388
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 That's the best.

389
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 Are you about to ask who cleans?

390
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 Who counts them?

391
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,440
 And I'm not going to ask who goes in and counts them.

392
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,440
 Yeah.

393
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,440
 Yeah, that's an 8.

394
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,200
 That's 8 of those.

395
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,040
 Some, yeah, technician with a magnifying glass.

396
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:07,080
 So for comparison, the article I was reading, which I guess was written by someone in Harvard,

397
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,640
 so they compared it to Harvard Square, they said Harvard Square would, in Boston, would

398
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,920
 be class 8 million.

399
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,920
 Oh, right.

400
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,500
 Just in the air, not even on the ground.

401
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,820
 In the air, yeah, in the air, 8 million particles per cubic meter.

402
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,820
 This has to have one.

403
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,980
 If there's more than one, you shut down the factory.

404
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,980
 Wow.

405
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:26,980
 That's awesome.

406
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,980
 My TV's got one of these.

407
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,980
 It's so annoying.

408
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:29,980
 What?

409
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,980
 Well, I think it's actually more of a dead pixel, but it's just this tiny spot and it's

410
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,780
 absolutely dead center.

411
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,380
 Everything I watch, whatever's in the middle, has like a small fly on it.

412
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,380
 Really?

413
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,020
 But you're always watching the darts, aren't you?

414
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,020
 Are you sure?

415
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,020
 Yeah.

416
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:45,680
 I'll stop drooling in when I watch it.

417
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,240
 That's so funny.

418
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,520
 You were saying that they need to be really thin and part of the reason for that is because

419
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,580
 to make your glass non-reflective, you need to put a kind of film on it.

420
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:02,480
 So if you just have normal glass, all the light's going to reflect off it, you're not

421
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,120
 going to be able to watch TV properly.

422
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,880
 And so they have something called non-reflective glass, and that was invented by someone called

423
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,540
 Catherine Burr Blodgett.

424
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:18,140
 And what she did was she basically would build up these one molecule films of atoms,

425
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:21,540
 and then she put another layer on and another layer on and another layer on.

426
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:25,500
 And so she could control exactly how thick it was going to be, and she worked out the

427
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,980
 exact thickness that it would have to be to make this glass non-reflective.

428
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,460
 It's absolutely incredible.

429
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:36,140
 The first movie that used her invisible glass was Gone With The Wind, and people said when

430
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:40,360
 they watched it how clear the cinematography was because the cameras had been using this

431
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,360
 amazing glass.

432
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,360
 When was this?

433
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,360
 This, well, Gone With The Wind was '39.

434
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,360
 Oh, so it was when it was released.

435
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,560
 I didn't realize they could do that kind of thing.

436
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,560
 Well, exactly.

437
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,560
 Amazing, right?

438
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:56,120
 But it was also her glass or her non-reflective glass was used in World War II to make periscopes

439
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,120
 as well.

440
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,120
 Oh, cool.

441
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,960
 And I was looking into new TV innovations and just trying to see if there's a TV that

442
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,960
 I haven't seen.

443
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,100
 Most of it is kind of just permutations, isn't it, at this point?

444
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:10,580
 It's just, you know, like, higher, higher, you know, Blu-ray, screen, you know, blah,

445
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,580
 blah, blah, blah, kind of stuff.

446
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:15,700
 Why were you fired from Curry's then?

447
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:20,220
 If you're a TV maker at the moment, and Dad's just saying how piss-easy it is to make a new

448
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:26,500
 TV, I just add a permutation right into Dad's right now.

449
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,500
 God.

450
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,500
 So, check this out.

451
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,200
 This is Samsung, and this is clever.

452
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,980
 Samsung have released a vertical TV.

453
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,980
 They've turned a TV on its side.

454
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:38,980
 Yeah.

455
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:39,980
 Cool.

456
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,560
 Now, it's very clever because why do you think they've done this?

457
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,380
 Oh, because people film vertically on the phone.

458
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,380
 Exactly.

459
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:49,300
 So, the new generation of kids that are sending their videos to the TV are not getting the

460
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,300
 proper view.

461
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,300
 Well, wait a minute.

462
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,300
 So, if I buy that TV, great.

463
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,880
 My daughter will be able to watch her TikTok videos whenever she's old enough to.

464
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,880
 And you'll have to watch the Sopranos.

465
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,880
 The Sopranos?

466
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,880
 No.

467
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:04,780
 So, Samsung very cleverly have made it so that you can flip it back the right way around

468
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,780
 and you still have.

469
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,780
 I know.

470
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:07,780
 I feel that's a gimmick.

471
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:12,040
 I'm going to say major, major advancement in the innovation of TV.

472
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,040
 Okay.

473
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,040
 All right.

474
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,040
 Here's another one.

475
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:19,940
 In fact, this sort of links back to why TVs are cheap these days is the TVs that watch

476
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,940
 you.

477
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:21,940
 Oh.

478
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:22,940
 Oh.

479
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,940
 It's not such a good show as the Sopranos.

480
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:26,940
 Poor things.

481
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,940
 No, no, no.

482
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:30,980
 The Sopranos are bored out of their fucking minds watching this guy.

483
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:35,900
 He's trying to rub off a little spot on his TV.

484
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,940
 So this is a really interesting thing.

485
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,940
 TVs are smart.

486
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:40,940
 They're internet connected.

487
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,900
 All TVs sold these days pretty much are that.

488
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:47,180
 And one thing that loads of TVs do, they collect your data and they will sell it to advertisers,

489
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,180
 right?

490
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:51,640
 And what that means is that TVs can be sold more cheaply because they know that for the

491
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:57,020
 next several years, they're going to be getting your data and that will be worth some money

492
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,020
 to them.

493
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:03,620
 So TVs are now being sold effectively for exactly what it costs to make them and then

494
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,420
 they will sell you viewing data and they can make the money back on the long run.

495
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:10,340
 And sometimes the data will be sold to places like Netflix, even if you don't have a Netflix

496
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,460
 account, which I find so bizarre.

497
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,460
 Yeah.

498
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,460
 And I think that might-

499
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,460
 Makes sense.

500
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,420
 I wonder if that theoretically means that when you turn on Netflix for the first time,

501
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,420
 if you do later get Netflix, they're like, "Ah, Mr Murray."

502
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:24,240
 "We've been expecting you."

503
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,240
 But jokes on them because I always make sure to only watch stuff I hate on my smart TV.

504
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,200
 That's really interesting because I do the same on Amazon.

505
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,240
 I only buy things I hate just to get those things.

506
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,560
 Just screw with those algorithms.

507
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,320
 They don't know what data they're getting.

508
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,680
 It's not the truth.

509
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:47,720
 I read about a very old bit of TV technology that I just had never heard of before and

510
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:52,060
 it seems an extraordinary thing, but have you guys heard of phone vision for TVs?

511
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,060
 No.

512
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,060
 Don't think so.

513
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:59,920
 Okay, so this was back in the '50s and what it was is that this was pay for TV.

514
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,700
 This was like pay-per-view TV.

515
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:05,740
 So if a movie had been out in the cinema for two years, they managed to get the rights

516
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:09,360
 to it and they would put it on TV and it would be the first time anyone would be seeing it

517
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,940
 on TV in their house.

518
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:14,800
 So how do you do pay-per-view for TV back then when you don't have the kind of payment

519
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,660
 systems and stuff that we do now?

520
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,120
 There was one that had a coin meter on the side of the TV.

521
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:22,600
 There was one that had a coin meter at night, but this is more interesting in a weird kind

522
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,000
 of technological way.

523
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,800
 What they did was you would go to the channel and you would see the movie playing, but it

524
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,600
 would be completely blurry and all just didn't make, you know, the sound wasn't there and

525
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,600
 didn't make sense.

526
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,120
 So you could see like, "Oh my God, Don with the wind is on.

527
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,120
 I need to get to it."

528
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:40,120
 And what you did was you then called up an operator and you told them that you would

529
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,720
 like to now watch this movie.

530
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,960
 It would cost a dollar and they would add that to your phone bill and what they would

531
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:50,380
 then do is send a frequency through the phone that would somehow play with the TV and un-blur

532
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:52,700
 it and give you all the sound.

533
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:56,300
 So it was your phone and TV working together to get a frequency right.

534
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,300
 Yeah.

535
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:00,980
 I mean, it's mad and they did many tests on it and never kicked off, obviously, because

536
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:01,980
 various reasons.

537
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:05,140
 If you were quite stingy, because this is definitely what I would do, especially if

538
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:08,940
 I was a teenager or something, do you know if you could watch the whole thing, but like

539
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:12,660
 the blurry crap version that didn't really make sense, like that would keep playing?

540
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,660
 I think so.

541
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,920
 I would totally do that and just sort of try to work out.

542
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,480
 You know when you used to get like bootleg DVDs from foreign countries?

543
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,480
 Filmed in a cinema.

544
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,480
 Yeah.

545
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,400
 And you watched the bottom quarter of the screen and you'd only see half of their bodies.

546
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,400
 Yeah, exactly.

547
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:29,840
 I was reading about what claimed to be the first remote control, the lazy bones.

548
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,720
 And it was a remote control and it was connected by a cable to the television.

549
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:39,520
 So it's not completely remote and the operation is mechanical, it's not electronic.

550
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,280
 So you know, when you press it now, it's a little infrared beam or whatever.

551
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:46,860
 These days, if you press the button, it activated a motor that was used to physically turn the

552
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,580
 dial on the television.

553
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:53,420
 It feels like this should be a little hand-like thing for the Adams family to do.

554
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,420
 Yeah.

555
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:58,740
 On remote controls, is that what your family calls those items, everyone else, what do

556
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,740
 you call it?

557
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,740
 I'd say the buttons.

558
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,740
 The buttons.

559
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,860
 They say channel changer.

560
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,340
 Channel changer, that's not unusual.

561
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:11,140
 We used to call them the magic buttons and there was a list online of someone did a survey

562
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:16,800
 of what people in the UK call them and magic buttons wasn't in the top 100, I should say.

563
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,600
 But the number one was remote.

564
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,880
 Can you guess any of the others in the top five?

565
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,200
 We haven't said them yet.

566
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,200
 The doofa.

567
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,200
 Doofa number two.

568
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,200
 Yes.

569
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:31,940
 The word doofa originally meant half a cigarette in the 1920s and it came from this will doofa

570
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:32,940
 now.

571
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:33,940
 This will do for me.

572
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:34,940
 That's brilliant.

573
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:35,940
 Nice.

574
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:36,940
 Okay, so that's remote doofa.

575
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:37,940
 Was it one?

576
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:38,940
 Was one the thing?

577
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:39,940
 Like a magic?

578
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:40,940
 That's not one that I saw.

579
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:41,940
 The thing?

580
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,940
 No.

581
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,940
 Zappa, Flickr and Flickr.

582
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:45,940
 Jobby?

583
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:46,940
 Jobby.

584
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,940
 Jobby, you got something to say about that.

585
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,940
 Someone's left a jobby on the arm of a sofa.

586
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:52,940
 No, Anna.

587
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,540
 Put the jobby on the table where it belongs.

588
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:57,940
 You haven't seen much Billy Connolly, have you?

589
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:01,940
 Jobby, I believe, is only a euphemism for poo, to my knowledge.

590
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:02,940
 Okay, come on.

591
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:06,940
 You used the word jobby when you can't think of the right word for something.

592
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,940
 They're right.

593
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:08,940
 You passed that jobby over there.

594
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:12,940
 Your poor housemates come home with remote controls in the toilet again.

595
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,940
 Puts doesn't make any sense.

596
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,940
 You're just plunging away at it.

597
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,940
 They were leaving poos on our tables.

598
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,940
 I never understood why.

599
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:28,940
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is my fact.

600
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:33,940
 My fact this week is that Queen Charlotte once got seasickness while visiting an art

601
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:36,940
 exhibition on land.

602
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:37,940
 Amazing.

603
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:44,940
 I can't believe we got a fact about sickness.

604
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,940
 Literally recovering from food poisoning.

605
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,940
 I just feel like a terrible listener, just so you know.

606
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,940
 I got this fact from a brilliant book by a buddy of ours, Edward Brook Hitching.

607
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,940
 It's called The Madman's Gallery, which is an incredible book, by the way.

608
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:01,940
 I love his books and this is a beautifully illustrated book all about the weirdest and

609
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:05,940
 most quirky and curious bits of art that have been made over the course of history

610
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:06,940
 all over the world.

611
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:09,940
 It's like he's curated this really stunning book.

612
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:13,940
 And one of the chapters talks about this incredible thing that happened just five

613
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:18,940
 minutes walk from where we are, Leicester Square, down the road in 1790s.

614
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:24,940
 In 1794 particularly, when Queen Charlotte went to see what was a giant panoramic piece

615
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:30,940
 of art, huge in a purpose built building so that you could go inside and be immersed

616
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,940
 by this extraordinary scene.

617
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:37,940
 And one that he did was a sea battle and Queen Charlotte went to see it and she was

618
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:42,940
 so immersed and felt so overcome by all the movement of the ships that she got seasick.

619
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:46,940
 And there's a few stories that said she vomited into her handkerchief.

620
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,940
 There's others that say she was very nauseous.

621
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:49,940
 Yeah.

622
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:50,940
 But yeah.

623
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:51,940
 Which handkerchief?

624
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,940
 Was that a blower or a shower?

625
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:54,940
 Must have been the blower.

626
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:55,940
 It was a vomer.

627
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,940
 It was a special handkerchief.

628
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:58,940
 Yeah, it's interesting.

629
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:06,940
 She, I think the main part of the story comes from the memoirs of the man who created this

630
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:10,940
 panorama, whose name was Barker, Robert Barker.

631
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:16,940
 And he wrote that Charlotte had told him that she had felt seasick at the time.

632
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:19,940
 There is a suggestion that he was quite a salesman.

633
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:20,940
 Yes.

634
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:21,940
 I used to make stuff up.

635
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:22,940
 Absolutely.

636
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:23,940
 So there's a chance it might not be true.

637
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:24,940
 Totally.

638
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,940
 But there's a chance though of just like how people who went in.

639
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,940
 That's for sure.

640
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:29,940
 It did happen.

641
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:30,940
 The people got seasick.

642
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:31,940
 Yeah, people got seasick.

643
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,940
 But also the thing was that the paintings themselves were, they were beautiful paintings,

644
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:37,940
 but they were sort of presented in this way that they kind of were a bit of an illusion

645
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:42,940
 that you got a bit confused that maybe something was going on and your eyes were playing tricks

646
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:43,940
 with you.

647
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:48,940
 So in the sea battle one, there was a capsized shipboat and there was sailors that were struggling

648
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,940
 in the waves.

649
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:52,940
 And according to one story, there was a guy who was visiting and he had his dog with

650
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:59,940
 a Newfoundland dog and this dog saw the drowning man in the painting and leapt over to rescue

651
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,940
 the drowning man.

652
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,940
 That is one of the stories.

653
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:05,940
 Again, I think that was used in the advertising for the panorama.

654
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:09,940
 I think whether it happened, it might have happened, but yeah, they said this is so realistic,

655
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:10,940
 but this happened.

656
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:11,940
 Yeah, exactly.

657
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:12,940
 Keep your dogs at home.

658
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:13,940
 Do not risk your dogs.

659
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:14,940
 That's so funny.

660
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:18,940
 I'm imagining like the end, you know the end of the Truman Show where the dog bites through

661
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:22,940
 the screen and he's suddenly in the real world.

662
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:23,940
 It's not a spoiler.

663
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:24,940
 He's been trapped.

664
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:25,940
 It is, yeah.

665
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:30,940
 If you haven't seen the end of the Truman Show yet, James, it's almost as old as Anna Karenina.

666
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:37,940
 This building is so cool and like Dan says, the building where he hosted lots of his panoramas,

667
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,940
 I went to it today.

668
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:40,940
 Oh, did you?

669
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:41,940
 Yeah.

670
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:44,940
 It's right next to the Prince Charles Cinema and the Leicester Square Theatre, you know,

671
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:48,940
 the street just off Leicester Square and it's now a French Catholic church.

672
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,940
 It's the church of Notre Dame de France.

673
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,940
 And you're a French Catholic, aren't you?

674
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,940
 So you just have to be taking a map.

675
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:55,940
 That's how I got in.

676
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:56,940
 Yeah, yeah.

677
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:01,940
 And it's, you go into the church and it's a completely round church and you think, oh,

678
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:02,940
 that's interesting.

679
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:07,940
 It's not a classic, your classic church cross shaped and it's beautiful in there and you

680
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:08,940
 can, you can really imagine.

681
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:09,940
 You could still go in.

682
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:10,940
 That's really interesting.

683
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:11,940
 It's completely open every day of the week.

684
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:15,940
 He actually invented the word panorama, he said.

685
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:19,940
 And he, it is worth thinking about how amazing it would have been to go into this place.

686
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:20,940
 It was two levels.

687
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:24,940
 And so I think he had two panoramas exhibiting in there at the same time.

688
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:25,940
 Yes, yeah.

689
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:29,940
 And it was kind of like when you go to a fairground, like one of the bit more crap rides where

690
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:30,940
 you just walk around it.

691
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:34,940
 But still, you look at the big painting on the ground floor and then he went through a

692
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:39,940
 series of pallet cleanser dark corridors and staircases so that you could have raised that

693
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,940
 from your mind so that you could get up to the next floor and enjoy that one.

694
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:46,940
 Even to get to the first one, you had to go through some weird dark corridors, didn't you?

695
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:49,940
 And the way that it was lit was really impressive.

696
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:54,940
 Like it was lit from above using natural light, but it meant that it was really realistic.

697
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,940
 And so you would kind of go through all these dark corridors, dark corridors and then you'd

698
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,940
 be hit by this incredible scene.

699
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:00,940
 Yeah.

700
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:04,940
 But what that did mean was that at certain times of the year, it was better than others.

701
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:07,940
 So for instance, if the weather wasn't good, it wasn't that good to see.

702
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,940
 If it was foggy, you probably wouldn't go.

703
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,940
 If it was raining, you probably wouldn't go.

704
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,940
 In winter, you probably only go on midday.

705
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,940
 The rest of the day, it was not quite so good.

706
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:19,940
 And it was like a shilling to go, which is not that much, but to some London as it was.

707
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,940
 So if you're going to spend your money, you go on a really good day.

708
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:22,940
 But they kept putting them on.

709
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:25,940
 So he started in 1787, painting his first ever one.

710
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:28,940
 And it opened up in London in the 1780s or '90s.

711
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:32,940
 At the Leicester Square one, they had a new show every couple of years until 1861.

712
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,940
 So they had 126 different panoramas.

713
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:35,940
 So good.

714
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:36,940
 It's a huge industry.

715
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:39,940
 And it meant you could travel the world from London.

716
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,940
 You could see all sorts of different cities and places and historical things.

717
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:45,940
 You could see battles and you could see revolutions.

718
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,940
 And it just sounds unbelievably good.

719
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:52,940
 And what's particularly beautiful about it is so you do have the ones where it's all battle scenes.

720
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:57,940
 And the painters used to go and interview people of the area and they would try and get the landscape.

721
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:01,940
 But for me, the most beautiful ones are there was a panorama of Edinburgh.

722
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:07,940
 And what it was is he stood up, I think, with his son on Coulton Hill in Edinburgh.

723
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:10,940
 And so when you stand in the centre of this panorama,

724
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:15,940
 what you're seeing is literally the view absolutely perfectly matched for what you would see

725
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:18,940
 if you were standing in his shoes when he was painting it.

726
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:21,940
 I just find that absolutely stunning as a concept.

727
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,940
 That was his first one.

728
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,940
 I mean, that is the premise of all paintings.

729
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,940
 You'll see what the painter was seeing.

730
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,940
 Yeah, apart from abstract ones.

731
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:32,940
 Oh God, I mean, yeah, but the sea battle ones that were showing, you know,

732
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:36,940
 that wasn't someone while everyone was falling out of their boats and everything was on fire.

733
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,940
 Sorry, can you just hold it for one minute?

734
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,940
 Stop! Moving!

735
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:43,940
 The panoramas in general, they became huge.

736
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:46,940
 So Barker started this trade. He really quickly had imitators.

737
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,940
 He trademarked it, didn't he?

738
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,940
 He tried to make sure that that was his invention.

739
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,940
 But then it ran out after about a decade.

740
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:55,940
 And so then it was a complete free for all the panoramas everywhere.

741
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:59,940
 And then in 1831 in Paris, which was about the Battle of Navarino, a naval battle,

742
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:03,940
 and the producer, this is so cool, he was called Charles Longlois,

743
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,940
 and he replaced the normal viewing platform that everyone would stand on in the middle

744
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:09,940
 and look around at the picture with the poop deck of a ship

745
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:12,940
 which had taken part in the Battle of Navarino.

746
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,940
 - Nice. - Ultra realistic.

747
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:17,940
 He had a ventilation to give a sea breeze,

748
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:22,940
 and he did all of this clever stuff to make it feel incredibly accurate.

749
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:25,940
 The poop deck, of course, covered in channel changers, wasn't it?

750
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,940
 Yeah.

751
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:30,940
 We covered very slightly ages ago about Banvard,

752
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,940
 and that brilliant book, Banvard's Folly,

753
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:35,940
 which we always get asked about from listeners.

754
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:39,940
 But what that was was those turnstile panoramas

755
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:42,940
 where it was basically a movie wrapped up,

756
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:45,940
 and you would turn it, and it would be a moving,

757
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,940
 as if you were on a train and the view was passing you by,

758
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,940
 the painting would pass you by, and they would have sound,

759
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:55,940
 they would have smells, kind of like what you're saying with the other immersive thing,

760
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,940
 and you would watch that like a movie, which is amazing,

761
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,940
 and Banvard had one which was the Mississippi Valley,

762
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:04,940
 and it was a three-mile canvas, three-mile-long canvas, he called it.

763
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:07,940
 It was actually half a mile, when people probably looked into it.

764
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:12,940
 But all of this, which feels like it's such a shame that we don't have this anymore,

765
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:17,940
 these panoramic retundas, I think they'd be beautiful to go into.

766
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,940
 It was cinema that killed it.

767
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:23,940
 And when cinema arrived, that just no one was interested anymore in seeing these things.

768
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,940
 But the panoramas, I don't know, they were still going

769
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:28,940
 at the turn of the 20th century, they were still really popular.

770
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:31,940
 They were still going, and basically the 1900 Grand Exhibition,

771
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:36,940
 which I think was in Paris, was the last, it was sort of the absolute apogee,

772
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:39,940
 and the final grand hurrah of the panoramas.

773
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:42,940
 I was reading a really great book called Panorama,

774
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:48,940
 and it said that between 1870 and 1900, 100 million people around the world went to see panoramas.

775
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:52,940
 Although 100 million tickets were sold, maybe a lot of that was the same people, but huge claim.

776
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:58,940
 Just on the kind of last hurrah of the panorama, the 1900 Grand Exhibition,

777
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:02,940
 so they got really, really fancy, basically, they built and built and built,

778
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:05,940
 and there were all these, they were called Rama shows, so there was the Daya Rama,

779
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:09,940
 there was the Alparama, the Cosmarama, Europarama, Neorama.

780
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,940
 - Future Rama. - Yeah, it developed.

781
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:15,940
 - Banana Rama. - In 1900, in the Grand Exhibition,

782
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:19,940
 this, oh, this sounds so good, the Mariorama.

783
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:28,940
 It's a bee, yeah, to find the princess, it was amazing.

784
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:32,940
 No, there was, so 700 people got on the platform,

785
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:38,940
 and then you would sail from Marseille to Yokohama, okay, a huge long voyage,

786
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:44,940
 and I don't know how it revolved or moved around you, but that's mostly sea, I would think.

787
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:47,940
 - It's all sea, oh yeah, sorry, it's complete sea voyage, but it was,

788
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,940
 - It's quite an easy thing to paint, is what I'm saying, you're absolutely right.

789
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:54,940
 - Whoa, you're saying a bunch of sea is an easy thing to paint, are you joining Dan?

790
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:58,940
 - Please write it. - And if you're an ocean painter.

791
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:03,940
 - Turner, please get in touch. - No, you're right, sorry,

792
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:07,940
 there were big sites along the way of Naples, and the Suez Canal, and Sri Lanka,

793
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:11,940
 and it sort of moved around you, and the, this is so cool,

794
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:16,940
 it was blown through a layer of kelp to make it seem like the sea breeze was blowing around you.

795
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:22,940
 - Just on vomiting and art, sickness and art, do you guys know Millie Brown?

796
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:25,940
 - Doesn't sound familiar. - So she's friends with Lady Gaga,

797
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:30,940
 and so when she was 17 in the early 2000s, she was a young artist,

798
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:33,940
 she went on stage in Berlin doing some performance art,

799
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:38,940
 and she decided, hadn't tried it before, to try and vomit art onto a canvas,

800
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:42,940
 and she lined up seven bottles of different coloured milk, dyed differently,

801
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:47,940
 and then the whole show is two hours of watching her throw it up.

802
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:52,940
 - I could have done that yesterday. - But no one would have paid to watch you.

803
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:57,940
 - Well, that's the artificial barriers of the art world, frankly.

804
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:00,940
 - Right. - Exactly, I often go to the tape mud and go,

805
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:04,940
 "I could have done that." My five-year-old could have done that, I literally could.

806
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:08,940
 - She just goes to Leicester Square on a Saturday night, get the three Millie Brown show,

807
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,940
 all sorts of colours. - Wow, so what did she manage to do?

808
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:14,940
 Did she manage to do a nice picture of some flowers, or perhaps a portrait?

809
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:20,940
 - It was a beautiful, sort of impressionist, water lilies, yeah, it was a vomity mess,

810
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,940
 I suppose, but I'm sure it was very good.

811
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:26,940
 She said there was an old lady who was so moved that she left in tears.

812
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:31,940
 - Optical illusions? - Sure.

813
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:35,940
 - Just things that look different or make you feel weird.

814
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:41,940
 So if you're a footballer and you score a goal, the next time you approach the goal,

815
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:47,940
 you perceive it as bigger than it is, and if you take a shot on goal and you miss,

816
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:50,940
 the next time you perceive it as smaller.

817
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:53,940
 - I watch a lot of basketball and you read about that a lot of players saying that

818
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:59,940
 when they get on a run of three-pointers, the basket, the rim just feels like it's a bucket size,

819
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,940
 like you just can't miss.

820
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:04,940
 - Yeah, bucket size is actually smaller than a basketball ring.

821
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,940
 - Sorry? - I think we have the average bucket.

822
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,940
 - Yeah, no good point on it. - Hang on, little garden bucket.

823
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:11,940
 - I'm sorry, Anna, I think you're really knowledgeable about loads of stuff.

824
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:14,940
 I don't think you know the size of the average bucket on Earth.

825
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:18,940
 - I'm watching, like, a metal bucket used for gardening.

826
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,940
 - I think she's right, I think a rim is right.

827
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:23,940
 - No, I'm thinking of a paint bucket, or a KFC bucket.

828
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,940
 - Also small. - Definitely, yeah.

829
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,940
 - That's small, that's small. - What's a bigger bucket?

830
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:31,940
 - Well, an ice bucket for the ice bucket challenge, absolutely huge, can be.

831
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:35,940
 - But that tended to just be a big, like, plastic box full of water used.

832
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,940
 - Yeah, that's a laundry basket. - You're thinking of a barrel, I think.

833
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,940
 - I think we're all making my case for meat, which is that a bucket is not a size.

834
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:44,940
 - When you take your kids to the beach, do you just take a giant,

835
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:50,940
 just dunk them with this giant barrel size bucket, make a sandcastle, bitch?

836
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:54,940
 - I read one last thing, this is quite rude, it's quite recent as well.

837
00:38:54,940 --> 00:39:00,940
 It's a news story, it's a guy who was, he was at an optical illusion show

838
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:04,940
 with his girlfriend, and there was one room in it where you could do an illusion

839
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,940
 which made things look bigger, right?

840
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:09,940
 Now, he did what any funny young man would do.

841
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:12,940
 - I've been in one of those rooms, I know what the one should mean.

842
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:15,940
 The person goes in one corner and then another person stands in the other corner

843
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:18,940
 and one of them looks like a giant and the other one looks tiny, right?

844
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:22,940
 - And he, obviously, obviously, got his knob out and said,

845
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:25,940
 "Look, look how much bigger it is from here."

846
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,940
 And his girlfriend said, "God, I can't take you anywhere."

847
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:28,940
 They were alone in the room.

848
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:31,940
 What he didn't realise was that the image was being projected onto a screen

849
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:34,940
 in another room next door, which was full of people.

850
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:35,940
 - Oh no.

851
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,940
 - He was arrested for exposing himself.

852
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:40,940
 - It feels, I mean, that kind of half there enough,

853
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,940
 but on the other hand, they should have told him that it was being...

854
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:43,940
 - They should have told him.

855
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:44,940
 - Definitely.

856
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:47,940
 You've got to be told, if you think you're alone in a room, you can do any sort of thing.

857
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:48,940
 - That's crazy.

858
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,940
 - He was completely mortified, he was so worried about it for two years.

859
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:53,940
 He has ended up being officially admonished.

860
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:57,940
 - I think that actually women shouldn't be allowed to walk past that illusion

861
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,940
 on a Saturday anyway.

862
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:02,940
 - I think Woking Golf Club should actually install one of those mirrors

863
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:05,940
 in the changing room, so that's going to solve lots of issues.

864
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:14,940
 - Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show, and that is James.

865
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:17,940
 - Okay, my fact this week is that when hyenas hunt,

866
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:20,940
 they often go for low-hanging fruit.

867
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:23,940
 They especially like buffalo testicles.

868
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,940
 - Oh, buffaloes.

869
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:29,940
 - It does not mean the buffalo is angry, and the buffalo is big.

870
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:32,940
 - Sure, but hyenas are quick.

871
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:33,940
 - Yeah, they are.

872
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:34,940
 - Convicious.

873
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:35,940
 - Then they've got hot chopped teeth.

874
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:36,940
 - Yeah.

875
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:41,940
 So hyenas are famous for being scavengers, I think, mostly.

876
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:45,940
 But if you look into it, they are all-rounders, really.

877
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:48,940
 They do scavenge sometimes, but they also hunt a lot,

878
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:52,940
 and they especially hunt when they don't have anything to scavenge.

879
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:58,940
 So there's been a thing recently in Kenya where there have been fewer lions around,

880
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:04,940
 and because there are fewer lions, there's fewer dead animals for the hyenas to go after.

881
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:08,940
 And because a hyena can't really chase a gazelle,

882
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:12,940
 because they're not fast enough, it's hard for them to catch big animals.

883
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:15,940
 They tend to go for things that are kind of easy for them to get.

884
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:20,940
 And according to this article I read, which was actually about the 2022 Kenyan election,

885
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:23,940
 weirdly enough, in this article,

886
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:29,940
 they said that there is a thing where they've been found to be grabbing the balls of buffaloes.

887
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:30,940
 - Oh, wow.

888
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,940
 - Is it kind of on the go, as in are they aiming to get the whole buffalo,

889
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:35,940
 and they just settle for the balls, or is it just--

890
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:39,940
 - I believe they go for a quick testicle and then they get--

891
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:44,940
 - The thing is, their teeth are so sharp, they're so fast at eating as well,

892
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:47,940
 they can just absolutely decimate their prey really quickly.

893
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:51,940
 I imagine the buffaloes might not even notice to begin with.

894
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:54,940
 Just to begin with, it's just so quick, it's just like, your balls are gone,

895
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:58,940
 and then it's like a few minutes later, feels a bit looser, goosey down there, what's going on?

896
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:00,940
 That is just such a precision cut.

897
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:02,940
 - I-- - Nope, no one?

898
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:07,940
 - If you're a buffalo, and you're a feeling sore, they're amazing though.

899
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:11,940
 So their teeth, properly, properly sharp, and this is the spotted hyena.

900
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:15,940
 So we've got four species of hyena that are alive today.

901
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:16,940
 We used to have a lot more.

902
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:20,940
 In the fossil record, there was something like 70 different species of hyena.

903
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:23,940
 They're even finding ones now that were sort of in the Arctic, North Canada,

904
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:27,940
 where they didn't think they were before, they found teeth extracts and so on.

905
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:30,940
 So we're finding more hyenas. - Probably bear balls.

906
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:34,940
 - But their teeth are so strong, they can chew through the skulls of elephants.

907
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:38,940
 And they can digest things in ways that most other animals can't.

908
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:41,940
 So they can properly digest bone in the hyena.

909
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:43,940
 - Yeah, they're the only things. - It's extraordinary.

910
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:46,940
 - Really, the only mammals that can digest bone are one of the only mammals.

911
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,940
 - Oh, wow. - But they're bone crunching,

912
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:51,940
 and that's really good because it sort of recycles stuff on the savanna,

913
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:54,940
 and it returns all those nutrients, all that good stuff in bone,

914
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:58,940
 like phosphorus and calcium goes into the soil, and they have white poo.

915
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:02,940
 So if you are looking around on the ground and you see some bright white poo,

916
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:04,940
 likely to be a hyena around.

917
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:07,940
 - Are they dangerous to humans? - They can hurt you.

918
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:09,940
 - You get your balls out.

919
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:12,940
 - They sound like a buffalo. - Not without my mirror.

920
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:15,940
 - You're an amusing optical illusion thing, I think that's really funny.

921
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:18,940
 I just want to say, I find hyenas very gross, personally.

922
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:21,940
 I know Anna... - Ooh, you're going to get letters.

923
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:24,940
 - You're going to get letters from the... - They're sort of pretty mean customers,

924
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:27,940
 and I know they have lots of good things about...

925
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:30,940
 - What do you like about them? - Oh, they're all God's creatures.

926
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:33,940
 - They're all God's creatures, but they just... - I know they look weird and ugly.

927
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:36,940
 - They're that weird sloping shape. - They make a horrible laugh.

928
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:40,940
 - They're in the Lion King, aren't they? - But they do make that horrible laugh.

929
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:43,940
 - They're pretty... - And do you think they're kind of laughing at you?

930
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:47,940
 - No, they never do whenever I'm here, and that's the annoying thing.

931
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:50,940
 I've been banging out some great material for them.

932
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:55,940
 - That solo show you took to the savanna was... - Have you ever gone to the zoo with Andy?

933
00:43:55,940 --> 00:44:01,940
 - I eat his abyss of themselves until Andy was passed and they go, "I prefer his old stuff."

934
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:04,940
 - Obviously Andy's not alone and not liking hyenas,

935
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:08,940
 and we've talked before about the Lion King effects, not helping their reputation as well.

936
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:11,940
 - I like them. I'm going to put it out there. I like them.

937
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:15,940
 - The kind of woke police comes along now.

938
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:18,940
 - Wait, I thought you were saying you like them too, Anna?

939
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:22,940
 - Yeah, I'm not going to make a big deal of it. - No, I'm not going to start an old campaign.

940
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:27,940
 - That's what happens when you try to do something nice, Dad.

941
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:30,940
 - You can't win here.

942
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:36,940
 - The word "mafisi" means hyena in Swahili, but in Kenya, it's also an insult.

943
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:39,940
 It's also slang. I think it means something like "shithead" or "shit friends" or something.

944
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:42,940
 - It's so weird that the people who know most about hyenas would have a negative word,

945
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:46,940
 which also means hyena. Wow, they're clearly misinformed, aren't they?

946
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:49,940
 I hope you go over and do a re-education tour.

947
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:55,940
 - There is something actually that they screw up for us, and that is if you are a paleoanthropologist.

948
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:58,940
 So maybe you don't like them from this perspective.

949
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:03,940
 Because this is people who are looking for evidence of hunter-gatherer humans,

950
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:06,940
 ancient humans or proto-humans.

951
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:10,940
 And sometimes it's really hard to tell if humans have been somewhere or if hyenas have been somewhere,

952
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:14,940
 because they are the only two things that can break up bones.

953
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:18,940
 And so you'll find piles of animal bones that have been shattered or mostly devoured,

954
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:22,940
 and humans had stone tools with which they could smash up bones.

955
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:24,940
 Hyenas obviously can just chew through them.

956
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:28,940
 And they actually, scientists did an experiment to see how we can tell the difference.

957
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:34,940
 And they fed some bones to hyenas, and they gave some bones to humans with a hammer,

958
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,940
 hammer stones, and told them to smash them up.

959
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:38,940
 And you can't really tell the difference.

960
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:39,940
 - That's so interesting.

961
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:44,940
 There is one interesting thing that hyenas can tell your paleo guys.

962
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:50,940
 Angles, and that is that there might have been neanderthals nearby.

963
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:54,940
 Because hyenas were kept by neanderthals as pets.

964
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:59,940
 So in the same way that humans had dogs for various different things,

965
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:06,940
 for partnership or hunting or whatever, then the neanderthals had hyenas.

966
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:09,940
 And the thing is that hyena is a type of cat.

967
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:12,940
 But it really fills in the niche of a dog.

968
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:15,940
 If you didn't know, you would think it was kind of a dog.

969
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:18,940
 And it could be that that's why they exist even,

970
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:21,940
 because they're basically the neanderthal dog.

971
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:25,940
 And then the neanderthals died out, but then the hyenas are still here.

972
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:30,940
 - And that's why they really miss their owners, which is why they're so bad.

973
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:32,940
 - I bet they ate their owners.

974
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:37,940
 That's why the neanderthals died out, actually, was because they had such incredibly unfriendly dogs.

975
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:43,940
 - It's funny you say that there was a find, I think, last year in a cave in Spain of neanderthal bones,

976
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:45,940
 and they think they were eaten by hyenas.

977
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:47,940
 - They might have sometimes turned on them.

978
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:51,940
 - They're just animals, they're just doing what they do, but they're unfriendly.

979
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:53,940
 They're not well-exposed to us.

980
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:55,940
 - They sort of arrive unfriendly as well, don't they?

981
00:46:55,940 --> 00:47:00,940
 So hyenas, it's dominated by the females, their societies.

982
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:04,940
 And when the mother is pregnant, in the later stages of pregnancy,

983
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:09,940
 there's a moment where sort of a lot of testosterone is released into the womb,

984
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:14,940
 and they basically just soak in it like a bath for the final stages of the pregnancy.

985
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:21,940
 And then when they come out, it's usually the female hyenas who really get more of this testosterone in them

986
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:24,940
 than the male hyenas, the boy hyenas that are coming out.

987
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:27,940
 And so the females are furious.

988
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:30,940
 They're in there, the testosterone is going crazy in them.

989
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:33,940
 Their teeth are ready, they get born with their eyes open, and they're just ready to fight.

990
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:38,940
 And if the litter that the hyena has, if that's the correct term, is two girls, let's say,

991
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:42,940
 then those two will immediately see some food and just try and kill each other

992
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:44,940
 to make sure that they're the one who gets the dinner.

993
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:47,940
 Whereas if a boy comes out with a girl, then there's no fighting,

994
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:51,940
 because the boy's like, "I'm not touching you, you're vicious, you're crazy."

995
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:54,940
 - These are Lion King ones.

996
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:58,940
 The ones that were animated in the Lion King, they were based on some real hyenas.

997
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:01,940
 I mean, obviously they're based on hyenas, but in fact, we know specifically

998
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:03,940
 which hyenas they were based on.

999
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:06,940
 And these are the hyenas from Berkeley, California.

1000
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:08,940
 And it's a classic Hollywood.

1001
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:12,940
 - I was going to say, do you think they go back to their pack and they're sort of,

1002
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:16,940
 "Oh, well, I'm the famous hyena." But if they're already living in Berkeley, then...

1003
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:19,940
 - They're already completely out of themselves. They've all been in something.

1004
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:21,940
 Yeah, they're on the bone smoothies.

1005
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:24,940
 There was this research centre in Berkeley which had 30 hyenas living in it,

1006
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:27,940
 and they were being studied by brilliant research scientists.

1007
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:30,940
 And I read a great piece all about this research centre.

1008
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:33,940
 One of the keepers of the hyenas who was interviewed in this article,

1009
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:35,940
 she was called Mary Weldella.

1010
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:37,940
 I don't know if I'm pronouncing it right, I'm sure I'm not.

1011
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:41,940
 But when the guy who's writing the piece goes and speaks to her,

1012
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:44,940
 he notices that Mary had a very, really peculiar thumb.

1013
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:47,940
 And you know why she had such a peculiar thumb?

1014
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:50,940
 - Well, she part hyena, a very small part hyena.

1015
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:51,940
 - Exactly right.

1016
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:54,940
 - She traps it in a door.

1017
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:57,940
 - It's more related to what I was trying to say.

1018
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:00,940
 - She had a very peculiar looking thumb.

1019
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:02,940
 - Had it been eaten by a hyena.

1020
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:03,940
 - It was her big toe.

1021
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:06,940
 And the reason was because her original thumb had been bitten off by a hyena.

1022
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:08,940
 And so they had to replace it with her big toe.

1023
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:10,940
 - Well, I bet she aggravated that.

1024
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:12,940
 I bet she gave it a thumbs down for something.

1025
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:16,940
 We've said there are four, you said Dan, there are four species of hyena.

1026
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:17,940
 - I did.

1027
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:20,940
 - And yeah, you say that they are more closely related to cats than to dogs.

1028
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:24,940
 But they're actually just their own, they're not even their own species.

1029
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:25,940
 They're their own family.

1030
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:26,940
 They're so different to anything else.

1031
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:30,940
 And each hyena species is in its own genus.

1032
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:33,940
 I think the spotted hyenas get all the most press.

1033
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:35,940
 And they are the ones who do the most hunting.

1034
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:37,940
 So actually they hunt most of the food.

1035
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:42,940
 They actually get more of their kills stolen by lions than the other way around.

1036
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:43,940
 - How do they?

1037
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:48,940
 - But my favorite hyenas are odd wolves, which get not that much press.

1038
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:52,940
 And odd wolves are the fourth species, which only eat insects.

1039
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:56,940
 And they're quite slow and quite crap at fighting.

1040
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:58,940
 - They only eat the testicles of ants.

1041
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:00,940
 - They're able to get down really low.

1042
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:02,940
 They're very good at limbo.

1043
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:04,940
 - God, I've heard of an odd wolf, but I did not know it was a kind of hyena.

1044
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:05,940
 - No, I didn't either.

1045
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:08,940
 - And now I've gone right off them.

1046
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:15,940
 - Well, bad news, Andy, because I know you don't want hyenas strolling the streets of Britain.

1047
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:20,940
 But, and they can't, according to the Dangerous Wild Animals Act of 1976.

1048
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:25,940
 You're not allowed to have a pet hyena, but you are allowed to have a pet odd wolf.

1049
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:26,940
 - Wow.

1050
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:31,940
 - Specifically in the lore, it says all hyenas are banned except for the odd wolf.

1051
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:32,940
 - No way.

1052
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:33,940
 - Wow.

1053
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:35,940
 - Well, because all they do is eat termites.

1054
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:37,940
 - Have you guys seen a photo of one?

1055
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:38,940
 Did they look like a hyena?

1056
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:39,940
 - Yeah.

1057
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:40,940
 - Are they sort of indistinguishable?

1058
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:41,940
 Same height, same size?

1059
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:44,940
 - Yeah, I would say they look, all four species look a bit different,

1060
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:46,940
 but very similar to each other.

1061
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:49,940
 - But they have like really long tongues, like an odd bark.

1062
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:50,940
 - All four, for instance.

1063
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:51,940
 - Yeah.

1064
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:53,940
 Basically, they're only way of defending themselves.

1065
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:56,940
 One of the only ways is they secrete this substance from the anal glands,

1066
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:58,940
 which is really disgusting.

1067
00:50:58,940 --> 00:50:59,940
 And actually, we don't know.

1068
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:02,940
 It could be defense, or it could be to mark their territory

1069
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:04,940
 or tell other hyenas where they are.

1070
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:08,940
 And according to, there was a book on African mammals I was reading,

1071
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:12,940
 which explained how they wipe their substances on the ground.

1072
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:16,940
 And they straddle a grass stalk, and then they rapidly squat,

1073
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:20,940
 I think, up and down on this grass stalk while inverting their anal pouch.

1074
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:22,940
 And it wipes this smear.

1075
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:26,940
 So you know if they've been around, you can see a little smear of their presence.

1076
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:29,940
 Do you know the hyena men in Nigeria?

1077
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:30,940
 - No.

1078
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:34,940
 - These are traditional storytellers, but their main trick seems to be,

1079
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:36,940
 there are a few of them there, itinerant.

1080
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:38,940
 They never stay in one place more than a couple of days.

1081
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:43,940
 And the main thing is they have sort of pet hyenas.

1082
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:47,940
 And their job, I think, is to sell kind of powders and potions

1083
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:50,940
 that can, you know, cure you of things.

1084
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:51,940
 And they have these pet hyenas.

1085
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:53,940
 And what they do is they beat drums to attract crowds,

1086
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:54,940
 and then the crowds come.

1087
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:58,940
 And then they put their arms and their heads inside hyena's jaws.

1088
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:01,940
 And so, look, I didn't bite my head off.

1089
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:03,940
 And that's because I've used this powder.

1090
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:06,940
 Why don't you buy some powder that won't bite your head off?

1091
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:07,940
 - What is the reason?

1092
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:09,940
 They've just domesticated the hyenas.

1093
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:11,940
 - Yeah, or maybe sometimes they do bite their heads off,

1094
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:12,940
 and they don't hear about those hyenas.

1095
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:13,940
 - Or it's an art wolf.

1096
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:14,940
 - Or it's not.

1097
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:16,940
 - It's just dressed as a hyena, yeah.

1098
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:19,940
 - It just licks inside your ear while it's long time.

1099
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:21,940
 - Wow, that's great.

1100
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:27,940
 Hyenas go on a diet during Lent in Ethiopia, specifically.

1101
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:29,940
 - That's amazing.

1102
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:33,940
 - Is it a Catholic country?

1103
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:34,940
 - It's very Christian.

1104
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:35,940
 - It's very Christian, yeah, sorry.

1105
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:38,940
 - In Ethiopia, there's constant fasting in the Christian community.

1106
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:39,940
 - Yeah, I really do.

1107
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:40,940
 - So I guess they're subscribing to that.

1108
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:43,940
 - Well, this was, again, a study done by a scientist

1109
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:48,940
 called Gaidi Yerga and colleagues who analysed 553 hyena scats

1110
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:52,940
 before, during and after the period of Lent in Ethiopia.

1111
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:56,940
 And what they found is that basically during Lent,

1112
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:58,940
 the butchers aren't selling meat

1113
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:00,940
 because people aren't eating meat as much, right?

1114
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:02,940
 So that's a problem.

1115
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:04,940
 Hyenas don't have as much scavenging to do.

1116
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:06,940
 So they hunt donkeys instead.

1117
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:08,940
 - All right, they don't say, oh, you know what?

1118
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:13,940
 I'm going to give up buffalo testicles just for the 40 days.

1119
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,940
 - Quite the reverse.

1120
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:18,940
 It's really bad to be a donkey during Lent in Ethiopia

1121
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:20,940
 because the odds of you being eaten by a hyena are rocket.

1122
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:21,940
 - Right.

1123
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:23,940
 - And they basically analysed all the hyena feces

1124
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:26,940
 and they found that donkey hair proportion in the feces

1125
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:30,940
 shoots up more than doubles during the Lenten period.

1126
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:32,940
 - That's a real stab in the face, isn't it?

1127
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:35,940
 Because as the creature that brought the Virgin Mary

1128
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:39,940
 into Bethlehem to give birth to Christ our savior.

1129
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:41,940
 - And took Christ into the...

1130
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:43,940
 - On Palm Sunday, wasn't he?

1131
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:45,940
 - When he arrived on a donkey, yeah, yeah.

1132
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:47,940
 - Well, and you're the one who's getting punished

1133
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:49,940
 at Lent of all times.

1134
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:50,940
 - There's irony.

1135
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:51,940
 - There's irony.

1136
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:53,940
 - No, one of those bloody gloomy all the time.

1137
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:57,940
 - That's what E.R. is thinking about.

1138
00:53:57,940 --> 00:54:00,940
 - I missed that bit of the hundred acre one

1139
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:02,940
 that E.R. gets eaten by a hyena.

1140
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:05,940
 (upbeat music)

1141
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:08,940
 - Okay, that's it.

1142
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:09,940
 That is all of our facts.

1143
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:10,940

00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:33,940
 Also check out Club Fish, the secret membership club.

1160
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:35,940
 Not so secret, you can just join it, anyone can.

1161
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:36,940
 And you should.

1162
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:37,940
 It's really fun.

1163
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:38,940
 You get bonus content.

1164
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:40,940
 There's a really cool community hidden away in Discord

1165
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:41,940
 where all the fans get together

1166
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:43,940
 and chat about their favorite things.

1167
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:44,940
 It's really, really fun.

1168
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:45,940
 Have a look.

1169
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:46,940
 But otherwise, just come back here next week.

1170
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:47,940
 We'll be back with another episode.

1171
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:48,940
 We'll see you then.

1172
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:49,940
 Goodbye.

1173
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:52,940
 (upbeat music)

1174
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:57,940
 (upbeat music)

1175
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:00,520
 (upbeat music)
