00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:16,760
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,640
 as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week coming to you live

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,440
 from the Crossed Wires Festival in Sheffield.

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:31,280
 [CHEERING]

6
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,200
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

7
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,640
 I am sitting here with Anna Toshinsky, Andrew Hunter Murray,

8
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,960
 and James Harkin.

9
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,200
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,000
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,120
 and in no particular order, here we go,

12
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,200
 starting with fact number one, and that is Andy.

13
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,840
 My fact is, in the 19th century, some Hungarian cavalry

14
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,640
 officers got extra pay specifically

15
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,520
 because they had to spend so much money on wax

16
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,760
 for their enormous moustaches.

17
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,200
 So we have on the screen here an enormous military moustache.

18
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,360
 This was the age of the moustache, the 19th century.

19
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,080
 There was an officer called the Hussar, very impressive.

20
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,120
 The Hungarian Hussars were the pride of Europe, amazing.

21
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,360
 And there was a writer called John Padgett,

22
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,560
 who was touring Europe in the 1830s,

23
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,280
 and he was in Hungary.

24
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,040
 He reported they were up to a foot long these moustaches.

25
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,520
 They were just incredibly stiff and waxed,

26
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,880
 and there was supposedly a little extra stipend

27
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,280
 for buying your moustache wax.

28
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,040
 Do you think it's--

29
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,200
 An advantage of someone shooting at you

30
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,800
 because you're a bigger target.

31
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,720
 They might hit the moustache, and it doesn't hurt so much.

32
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,280
 Yes.

33
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,040
 Yes, I do.

34
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,320
 Interesting theory.

35
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,800
 You say yes, you do, but I'm not getting that vibe from you.

36
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,160
 I think it's an interesting thing because John Padgett

37
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,840
 was going around, and he was interviewing people over there.

38
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,480
 And they were saying, the idea of not having a moustache at all,

39
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,800
 let alone a ginormous one that required wax,

40
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,480
 was an alien notion to some of them.

41
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,680
 They were like, that is what men literally have.

42
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,960
 You are not a man unless you have a moustache.

43
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,480
 How do you distinguish between men and women in the UK

44
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,880
 is what they were asking.

45
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,840
 There are other ways.

46
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,840
 They never found them.

47
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,560
 And that's why the Hungarian population has died out.

48
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,600
 In the 19th century, around the time this is happening,

49
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,800
 a lot of people are trying to prove various ethnic boundaries

50
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,600
 and saying, these people are from one race.

51
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,000
 These people were from another race.

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,440
 It was a big time for that.

53
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,160
 But a lot of them, I was reading articles,

54
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,080
 they really struggled with Hungarians

55
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,520
 because they couldn't compare their mouths

56
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,000
 because they couldn't see their mouths

57
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,120
 because they had such massive moustaches.

58
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,440
 There was a quote, "The machas," which is the Hungarians,

59
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,400
 are not only a moustachioed people,

60
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,560
 but also one that is proud of a moustache

61
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,120
 that recognizes it as a basic element of honor and respectability.

62
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,360
 That's amazing as well because you'd never have to worry

63
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,360
 about someone lip-reading you, right?

64
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,640
 There's just a wall of hair stopping.

65
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,520
 But it doesn't grow out of your mouth.

66
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,840
 No, but Anna...

67
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,040
 Can it grow down over it, really?

68
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,800
 Yeah, you can get one of the waterfall ones.

69
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,040
 Those are lovely, you know, they're like curtains, yeah.

70
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,040
 They don't sound lovely,

71
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,600
 but I think there often is a disparity

72
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,480
 between what women think of moustaches

73
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,880
 in terms of how attractive they are

74
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,960
 and what men think of them.

75
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,880
 But it definitely caught on, didn't it, in military trends.

76
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,160
 In fact, it was uniform regulation in the British Army

77
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,720
 from 1860 that every soldier should have short hair on their head,

78
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,600
 no hair on their chin, but hair on their upper lip.

79
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,760
 And I think it started with the East India Company

80
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:35,000
 and British soldiers went to India where, as is the case today,

81
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,720
 they are the world leaders in moustaches,

82
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,160
 I would say, probably.

83
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,640
 And it was a real mark of manliness

84
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,280
 for an Indian person to have a moustache.

85
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,200
 So they weren't going to respect, you know,

86
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,080
 British Army officers unless they did.

87
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,120
 And so then I think it spread from there and everyone had to have one.

88
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,920
 Everyone had to have one.

89
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,520
 And also in some countries, it was illegal to have one

90
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,880
 if you were not in the military

91
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,400
 because you're basically impersonating a soldier.

92
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,640
 Are we talking 19th century or is it...

93
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,680
 I don't think this is still in force, no.

94
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,280
 Actually, a lot of the rules about wearing moustaches of the army

95
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,760
 are not enforced anymore and it was World War One

96
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,160
 and it was because you had to put gas masks on.

97
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,920
 You can't get a proper seal on if you have a moustache.

98
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,720
 Yes, but this is exciting.

99
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,760
 There's new news from the British military on moustaches

100
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,760
 as of last year, and beards.

101
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,720
 So my friend is in the army and I rang him up and asked him about this.

102
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,960
 And it turns out, April last year, I think,

103
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,680
 finally the British Army, you're allowed to have a beard.

104
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,880
 - Oh, thank God. - I know.

105
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,760
 Before last April, you could have a moustache.

106
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,600
 That was fine, but a beard was absolutely not.

107
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,080
 There were Queen's regs on sideburns.

108
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,000
 Not like they could only come down a certain proportion of your ear.

109
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,440
 I just imagine in that episode of The Simpsons

110
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,960
 when Mr Burns doesn't know what sideburns are.

111
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,600
 I know I'm just referencing another TV show there, but...

112
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,920
 Yeah, but this has been changed, and finally...

113
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,280
 - That's really good. - ...the King himself intervened in this matter.

114
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,600
 - Did he? - Yeah, and you...

115
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,040
 He's always got his finger on the hot-button issues, hasn't he?

116
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,440
 I'm not sure whether you're allowed currently in the army

117
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,360
 to have a beard but no moustache.

118
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,200
 You're allowed a full set, so I don't know what the rules are.

119
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,880
 The rules were you basically couldn't do it,

120
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,000
 but you could get an exemption for religious reasons, right?

121
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,240
 If you were Sikh, for instance, you were allowed it.

122
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,360
 The few people in the army that were allowed it,

123
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,600
 so like drum majors, pipe majors, bugle majors, goat majors,

124
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,280
 which is people who love to have the goats,

125
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,800
 and pioneer sergeants.

126
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,400
 Pioneer sergeants are amazing.

127
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,760
 They're people who would be at the front of a regimen,

128
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,240
 and they would have a special apron that they wore,

129
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,080
 and their job was to clear the path for anyone who was walking behind them.

130
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,920
 - What? - And if someone's horse was wounded,

131
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,280
 it was their job, I'm sorry about this, to kill the horse.

132
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,840
 - Right, boy. - And also, they would cut off one of the legs

133
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,240
 and give it to the soldier to carry with them

134
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,920
 because the animals had numbers branded on their hoof,

135
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,320
 and you had to take it back to prove that...

136
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,840
 I haven't just lost my horse, like I've got this bit of it.

137
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,840
 - Oh, wow. - It all sounds made up, doesn't it?

138
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,920
 - That's amazing. - I was about to ask,

139
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,760
 why does he have an apron if his job is just going ahead of everyone else?

140
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,240
 But now you've said that cutting horses up is part of the job.

141
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,640
 It's a good weapon if you need it, as well, a horse's leg.

142
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,640
 - If you want to have other stuff. - I think if you're in a cavalry charge,

143
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,720
 and you're the one going, "I'll foot with the horse's leg."

144
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,840
 I feel like I would have two of the horses leg

145
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,840
 and bang them together like coconuts,

146
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,840
 so the other me thought I was on my horse.

147
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,840
 They'll think you're a coconut.

148
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,320
 That's a very good idea.

149
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,320
 - Interestingly, the thing you were mentioning about gas masks is,

150
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,320
 it was recently, in the last few years,

151
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,320
 it was learned that's the reason that Hitler ended up with his Hitler mustache.

152
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,320
 So he used to have a big, big mustache,

153
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,320
 and it didn't fit the regulations for the gas mask.

154
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,320
 - There's debate about this. - Yeah, absolutely.

155
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,320
 But this is from a biographer who knew him at the time who writes it.

156
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,320
 So it's a kind of, it's a firsthand account of someone's opinion,

157
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,320
 but absolutely, it's one of those contentious things.

158
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,320
 - I thought he was harking back to old-school Prussian stuff.

159
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,320
 I should say this fact comes from an article about,

160
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,320
 why don't politicians have mustaches anymore,

161
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,320
 in which Hitler plays a key role, I would say.

162
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,320
 (laughter)

163
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,320
 - So the other thing is, apparently pilots on airplanes

164
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,320
 have that similar thing about not having beards

165
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,320
 because they have to be able to get the mask on

166
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,320
 if they lose oxygen and the oxygen mask come down.

167
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,320
 So it could catch on fire.

168
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,320
 - Hang on, when they give us the safety briefing at the start,

169
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,320
 they never say, "Quickly shave your beard off,"

170
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,320
 and then apply the oxygen mask.

171
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,320
 It's actually like bearded to the goners.

172
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,320
 - I think so too.

173
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,320
 - It really struck me that the battle between beards and moustache,

174
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,320
 like they're on opposite sides of the fight, aren't they?

175
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,320
 Because as soon as a beard becomes popular,

176
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,320
 a moustache is just part of a beard.

177
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,320
 Or in fact, and I really like this quote,

178
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,320
 there was a novelist called Frank Richardson in the 19th century

179
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,320
 who said, "Moustaches get lost in the general face fungus."

180
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,320
 That is the popular beard.

181
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,320
 So I think it was quite good for moustaches

182
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,320
 when people like Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch

183
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,320
 in the 19th century started to discover that bacteria caused infections

184
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:05,320
 because suddenly people were losing their beards left, right and centre

185
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,320
 because the idea was that lots of bacteria was going to get caught in them.

186
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,320
 And in fact, there was a 1907 experiment

187
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:17,320
 where they made a woman kiss a very hirsute on the face man

188
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:22,320
 and found that he was polluted with tuberculosis and diphtheria bacteria

189
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,320
 as well as food particles and a hair from a spider's leg.

190
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:29,320
 Where did they get this man from?

191
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,320
 It's just in every man.

192
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,320
 You've probably got all of that in your beard right now, James.

193
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,320
 I don't deny it.

194
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,320
 So this is a lot about men in the army and stuff like that

195
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,320
 because we're talking about moustaches.

196
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,320
 But there is Manuela Seons,

197
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,320
 who's an Ecuadorian revolutionary female

198
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,320
 who used to wear a moustache.

199
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,320
 A false or...

200
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,320
 No, real.

201
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,320
 No, no, she didn't grow one.

202
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,320
 She was in the battle of Ayacuchco.

203
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,320
 And as Prusa was there,

204
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,320
 she carried around the moustache that she'd taken off a dead enemy.

205
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,320
 And she would wear it at masquerade balls.

206
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,320
 So she would go around and wear this moustache as just Prusa.

207
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,320
 This woman was one of Bolivar's people

208
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,320
 and actually was in a relationship with Bolivar for a lot of the time.

209
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,320
 Because I won the most important Ecuadorian revolutionaries.

210
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,320
 It just feels very hard to take a moustache off someone you've...

211
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,320
 That's quite an operation to shave off a...

212
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,320
 I don't think you shave it off. I think it's more of a scalping issue.

213
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,320
 Yeah, it's got to come with the skin.

214
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,320
 Otherwise, how do you piece it back together?

215
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,320
 And I think it's a good move at a dance

216
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,320
 because no one's going to refuse to get on your dance card

217
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,320
 once you tell them the moustache you're wearing

218
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,320
 belongs to the last bloke who refused to dance with you.

219
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,320
 Actually, there is some evidence that in the 19th century

220
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,320
 there was a trend for women to have a whiskery face.

221
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,320
 When whiskers became so popular,

222
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,320
 there were fashion journals that said

223
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,320
 women would start wearing their locks of hair

224
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,320
 down the side of their face where a man's sideburns

225
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,320
 would be in imitation of men's sideburns

226
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,320
 because they were so popular.

227
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,320
 And there were adverts for pencils for women

228
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,320
 to draw little whiskers on their cheeks.

229
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,320
 And there was a dye advertised for women's whiskers.

230
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,320
 Right.

231
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,320
 So this is the thing why don't women

232
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,320
 typically have as much facial hair as men?

233
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,320
 What is going on?

234
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,320
 Because there are all these reasons of why we've got hair on our head

235
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,320
 which is some protection.

236
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,320
 To keep you warm and stuff?

237
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,320
 To keep you warm, again, hair on your head,

238
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,320
 warm thing, armpit hair and pubic hair is to reduce friction.

239
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,320
 Also where I keep my tuberculosis.

240
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,320
 Right.

241
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,320
 So if these were reasons like friction and heat retention

242
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,320
 and keeping the sun off and all that,

243
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,320
 you would expect women to have full beards and moustaches as well.

244
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,320
 Which means it's either something in female relationships

245
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,320
 or male-male relationships,

246
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,320
 in that it's either to attract and impress and excite women

247
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,320
 or it's something to cow and repel rival men.

248
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,320
 Do you know what I mean?

249
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,320
 It's got to be the latter.

250
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,320
 Because as I say, the number of people I've come across,

251
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,320
 no offence, I'm trying to count the bearded people in the audience now quickly.

252
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,320
 I'm literally sitting next to you.

253
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,320
 I've come across so many people who are,

254
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,320
 so there's Rod Littlewood who's vice president of the World Beard Association,

255
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,320
 there's Steve Parsons of the British based Handlebar Club,

256
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,320
 Handlebar Moustaches,

257
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,320
 the world record holder who's an Indian man for the longest moustache.

258
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,320
 All of their wives say, "I didn't like it."

259
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,320
 I'd rather they didn't devote their entire lives.

260
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,320
 The poor wife of the Indian guy Ram Singh Chowhan said,

261
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,320
 "For the first decade or so, I thought this is a really bad idea.

262
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,320
 I'm sort of repulsed."

263
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,320
 And then eventually as I realised he was building a career out of it.

264
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,320
 How long is his, sorry?

265
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,320
 So his is 14 foot long.

266
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,320
 I think it's seven foot on each side.

267
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,320
 That's long.

268
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,320
 You could be in every room of the house at once.

269
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,320
 But today you can send it to the fridge to get a beer for you.

270
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,320
 That's nice.

271
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,320
 Apparently dipping them in beer is good.

272
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,320
 This is according to the Handlebar Club guy who says dip it in beer to keep it.

273
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,320
 Yeah, but what does his wife think?

274
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,320
 Well, indeed.

275
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,320
 There was a thing that said he's got a great comeback to his wife

276
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,320
 who complains about his facial hair.

277
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,320
 He always says, "I say kissing a man without a moustache

278
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,320
 is like drinking champagne without the bubbles.

279
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,320
 And I don't think that is a good comeback."

280
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,320
 Well, you also like white wine.

281
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,320
 Yeah, you're right.

282
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,320
 I think it is a men-to-men thing.

283
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,320
 Right.

284
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,320
 There was a piece in 1926 of the New York Times which claimed

285
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,320
 Ivan the Terrible, as Russians are,

286
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,320
 he liked a beard so well that he used to play by the hour

287
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,320
 with the flowing beaver of Queen Elizabeth's royal agent, George Killingworth.

288
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,320
 That's something.

289
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,320
 I'll ask on behalf of everyone.

290
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,320
 The Royal Beaver.

291
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,320
 With the flowing beaver of Queen Elizabeth's royal agent.

292
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,320
 Yeah, beaver is just another word for beard.

293
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,320
 Oh, that's all it is, guys.

294
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,320
 And it's overdue a comeback.

295
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,320
 We probably shouldn't talk about moustaches without mentioning

296
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,320
 our colleague who's been on the podcast a few times.

297
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,320
 Ann Miller is one of her favourite facts.

298
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,320
 She's got a huge moustache, hasn't she?

299
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,320
 She always likes his fact.

300
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,320
 Well, I'm going to ask, do you guys think that if you're in the CIA,

301
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,320
 should you keep a fake moustache on hand?

302
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,320
 Yeah, of course.

303
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,320
 No, not on your hand.

304
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,320
 Then you just put it up like that, and it's fine.

305
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,320
 That's going to work great on a podcast.

306
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,320
 We're not going to explain what Andy's doing even.

307
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,320
 You can imagine.

308
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,320
 But your imaginations run wild.

309
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,320
 I'm putting a finger in front to be a flowing beaver.

310
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,320
 That's what I'm doing.

311
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,320
 It's working like a charm.

312
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,320
 Well, so the fact that Ann loves is that in 2008,

313
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,320
 there was an MI6 officer on the one show whose fake moustache fell off

314
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,320
 halfway through an interview, which is absolutely cracking.

315
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,320
 You can't see the footage.

316
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,320
 It was because they didn't actually broadcast it.

317
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,320
 Only the people in the studio know.

318
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,320
 But John Amendez, who was the CIA's mass dress of disguise

319
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:02,320
 during the George Bush era, the George Bush senior era, sorry,

320
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,320
 she says that you shouldn't go for fake moustaches

321
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,320
 because they are very uncomfortable.

322
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,320
 So it's always obvious when someone's got one.

323
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,320
 And the glue does tend to melt and it falls off,

324
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,320
 which gives the game away.

325
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,320
 She said, instead, horn-rimmed glasses, very effective,

326
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,320
 because you notice the glasses and not the person,

327
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,320
 and just accessorize.

328
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,320
 So just carry a nice leather bag and a big cigar,

329
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,320
 and people will remember those two things.

330
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,320
 Is it possible that Elton John has been deep cover CIA over the years?

331
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:36,320
 [music]

332
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,320
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

333
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,320
 My fact this week is that one of the most successful club songs

334
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:50,320
 of all time is mostly used to stop people from wanting to dance.

335
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:56,320
 I got to say, I think that pretty much all club songs make me not want to dance.

336
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,320
 Agreed. I just want audiobooks. That would be great.

337
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,320
 Two AM audiobooks.

338
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,320
 So this is, we'll all know the song, "Robert Miles' Children."

339
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,320
 You know that? [sings]

340
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,320
 So that was a song that was written by Robert Miles.

341
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,320
 He wrote it in Italy. He was writing under another name.

342
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,320
 He came Robert Miles because he wanted to go Miles in his career,

343
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,320
 so he had a real destiny thing to his name because he wanted to go far.

344
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,320
 They do kilometers, don't they?

345
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,320
 Yeah.

346
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,320
 A mile is even longer.

347
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:32,320
 Yeah, and so he wrote this song, and he wanted the song to be played

348
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,320
 at the end of every single club night, every rave that was happening,

349
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:39,320
 because a lot of car crashes were happening after raves.

350
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,320
 And it was because everyone was leaving the club of a really pumping song,

351
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,320
 really adrenaline-ized, they'd get in the car and they would crash.

352
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,320
 The idea was play this song at the end of the set,

353
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,320
 and it would put a trance-like music, it would calm the person down,

354
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,320
 and allow them to get into their car a bit safer.

355
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,320
 And DJs globally have been doing it.

356
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,320
 It's obviously not going to be every rave that does that,

357
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,320
 but largely that's what that song became.

358
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,320
 It was Road Safety, basically, for the end of a night.

359
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,320
 I didn't think I knew that song, and then as soon as I listened to it,

360
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,320
 I thought, "Oh, of course, I've heard this dozens of times."

361
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,320
 It was absolutely massive, wasn't it?

362
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,320
 It apparently cost just £150 to produce it,

363
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,320
 and it got to number one in Europe, the whole of Europe, for 13 weeks,

364
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,320
 and he was the only Italian solo artist to ever win a Brit award.

365
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,320
 Really? Wow.

366
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,320
 Absolutely huge, and he died very young.

367
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,320
 He did, 47, very sadly. It's a shame.

368
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,320
 This thing was called the Saturday Night Slaughter,

369
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,320
 or in Italian, Stradgidel Sabato Sera.

370
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,320
 It was a recognized thing.

371
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,320
 It was hundreds of young Italian people were dying every year.

372
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,320
 I think they might have assessed how much effect it's had,

373
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,320
 because I've heard this song at the end of things like, you know,

374
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,320
 Roller Disco, but I don't think that was...

375
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,320
 Is that the closest you've been to a nightclub?

376
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,320
 Yeah, I think it might...

377
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,320
 Well, it's pretty exciting in there, Anna, so...

378
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,320
 Oh, you're still on wheels, so it makes sense, right?

379
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,320
 Like, that's a good use.

380
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,320
 But I didn't think I liked dance music, and it turns out I do.

381
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,320
 Have you ever been to a rave?

382
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,320
 No.

383
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,320
 I mean, some of that Roller Disco got pretty heavy, but...

384
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:14,320
 I feel like you would have been cheering on the Public Order Act of 1994

385
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,320
 that kind of stopped all the raves from happening in the 90s.

386
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,320
 Yeah, I've got that printed out on my wall.

387
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:25,320
 That law changed the number of people you needed at a rave from 100 to 20.

388
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:29,320
 So if you had 20 people in an area and they were all dancing to music,

389
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,320
 then you could nick them all.

390
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,320
 And you could ban anyone who was playing music,

391
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:40,320
 which was predominantly characterized by the omission of a succession of repetitive beats.

392
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,320
 Right.

393
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,320
 And they issued a track called Flutter,

394
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:51,320
 and in that track, no two bars had the same beat.

395
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,320
 So it was awful.

396
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,320
 Well, I know, it sounds awful.

397
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,320
 It was awful. It was really awful.

398
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,320
 But it did the job of that you were allowed to play it in a rave

399
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,320
 because it didn't have repetitive beats in it.

400
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,320
 But no one's dancing to it, presumably.

401
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,320
 Everyone leaves the rave, so it sounds like it would do the job of...

402
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,320
 The profits for it went to Liberty.

403
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,320
 It is crazy that they tried to ban repetitive music.

404
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,320
 But the police were really worried. It was in the early '90s, wasn't it?

405
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:21,320
 So this law was 1994, and that followed a couple of years of national panic,

406
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,320
 sort of moral panic about raves and rave music.

407
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:27,320
 There was a thing called the rave at Castle Walton Common in 1992,

408
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,320
 where people danced for five days,

409
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,320
 and it was a free, illegal festival basically for about 20,000 people.

410
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,320
 And the police were just so worried about it.

411
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,320
 The same year, they broke up a party by using a JCB digger

412
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,320
 to smash through one of the walls of the party.

413
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,320
 I know, it was a very, very intense time.

414
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,320
 That sounds more dangerous than the dancing itself, doesn't it?

415
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,320
 Especially for people like Andy, who's just standing next to the wall,

416
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,320
 not wanting to dance.

417
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,320
 I just can't roll a scale. That's the problem, you know.

418
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:01,320
 But actually, at that time, the rave culture was known as the second summer of love,

419
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,320
 but it was credited for reducing football hooliganism.

420
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,320
 There were a lot of people who were going to football matches

421
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,320
 and who might have caused a fight otherwise.

422
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,320
 Instead of taking lots of cocaine, they were taking lots of ecstasy

423
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,320
 and just hugging each other.

424
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,320
 Oh, much better, yeah.

425
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,320
 So that's an interesting thing.

426
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,320
 I went to a rave four nights ago.

427
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,320
 No, you did.

428
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,320
 Yes, I did. It was a birthday party in Margate.

429
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,320
 I got a lot of trouble from my friends there, because I brought a book with me.

430
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:34,320
 And I do think like 2 a.m. dance floor book club would be an amazing thing to set up.

431
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,320
 So I went the other night and I remembered what it was like to go to a rave.

432
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:41,320
 It was really fun, but one thing I didn't see there, which apparently happens a lot in raves,

433
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:45,320
 is a lot of people are sucking on pacifiers, on dummies.

434
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,320
 And I'd never heard of that, but apparently this is a big thing.

435
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,320
 And the reason is it's because if you're at a rave, you're often on drugs,

436
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:55,320
 MDMA, a big one, leads to a massive amount of grinding of teeth.

437
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:00,320
 People used to do that in my world of days.

438
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,320
 Here we go. All right.

439
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,320
 And I'm not going to go into any further detail.

440
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,320
 Okay, so pacifiers, dance music.

441
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:12,320
 Do you want to play a game of type of electronic music or show on CBBs?

442
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,320
 Yes.

443
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,320
 Okay.

444
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,320
 Okay, so Fidget House.

445
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,320
 Is that a show on CBBs or is it type of electronic music?

446
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,320
 I'll say that's CBBs.

447
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,320
 Yeah, CBBs.

448
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,320
 Okay, I'll go just for the sake of Variety House.

449
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,320
 You are correct, Dan.

450
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,320
 It is defined by snatched vocal snippets,

451
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,320
 pitch bent dirty bass lines,

452
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:39,320
 and rave style synth stabs over glitchy 4/4 beats.

453
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,320
 Wow.

454
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,320
 And I might as well have said anything on that stage.

455
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,320
 What about Puffin Rock?

456
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,320
 Oh, God.

457
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,320
 Yeah, clearly house music, dance music.

458
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,320
 Audience Puffin Rock.

459
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,320
 CBBs.

460
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,320
 We have a very young audience in today, we should say.

461
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,320
 They're all sucking on pacifiers on the front row.

462
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,320
 Yeah, it's an animated children's series about a young Puffin named Una.

463
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,320
 Okay.

464
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,320
 Are there any glitchy 4/4 beats?

465
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,320
 Baby Club.

466
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,320
 Baby Club.

467
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,320
 Is it Baby Club or is it Baby Club Music?

468
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,320
 I think it's Baby Club Music.

469
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,320
 Yeah, Music.

470
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,320
 You are so bad at this.

471
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,320
 And also, don't you have very young kids?

472
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:29,320
 I haven't actually locked in my answer yet.

473
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,320
 I feel like I might have given away.

474
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,320
 Go up, Dan.

475
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,320
 Club.

476
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,320
 No, CBBs, obviously.

477
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,320
 Yeah, I know.

478
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,320
 It's where all the kids sit round in a circle and sing songs.

479
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,320
 Oh, beautiful.

480
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:44,320
 And finally, Squee, S-K-W-E-E-E.

481
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,320
 Club.

482
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,320
 Baby.

483
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,320
 Club.

484
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,320
 It is a type of music.

485
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,320
 Yes.

486
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:54,320
 It's a type of music where the aim is to squeeze out as much interesting sounds as possible.

487
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,320
 From where?

488
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,320
 From the synthesizers, Dan.

489
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,320
 Ah, okay.

490
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,320
 One of the things I find quite interesting is that the subgenres of dance are basically

491
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,320
 just defined by their tempo, right?

492
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,320
 So, trance was just it going slower.

493
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,320
 And so, the oldest trance band is a thousand years old.

494
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,320
 And they're so cool.

495
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,320
 They're called the Master Musicians.

496
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,320
 Is this like collectively?

497
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,320
 Like how the Rolling Stones are about 400 now?

498
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,320
 No, no, no.

499
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,320
 It's been going for a thousand years.

500
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,320
 Okay.

501
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,320
 They're all still in fitters fiddles.

502
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,320
 There's been some handover.

503
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,320
 So, it started a thousand years ago.

504
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,320
 It's based in Sufi tradition.

505
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,320
 And it's in Morocco.

506
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:39,320
 They opened Glastonbury in 2023, which I think just means you play Glastonbury when no one's

507
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,320
 quite arrived yet.

508
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,320
 But still, and they're incredible.

509
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,320
 You should look them up.

510
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,320
 And they're better than anything you see at a club.

511
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,320
 So, performances in their, like, if they do a performance,

512
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,320
 it goes on all night or it can go on for days.

513
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,320
 They play constantly.

514
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,320
 It's supposed to induce a literal trance.

515
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:00,320
 And it's on drums and would win mostly lots of circular breathing.

516
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:06,320
 And then it climaxes in this pan-like god who comes and dances around flames and quivers

517
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,320
 and chases children around with olive branches.

518
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:14,320
 And he's dressed in the skins of four black goats.

519
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,320
 And he's been played by the same guy for the last 50 years.

520
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,320
 Anyway, you can go.

521
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,320
 It's the festival in Morocco.

522
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,320
 You can go and see them perform.

523
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,320
 It's the smallest festival in the world.

524
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,320
 Only 50 people can attend.

525
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,320
 Have a tent or want to attend.

526
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,320
 Yeah, they've never actually set a limit.

527
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,320
 It sounds great.

528
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,320
 You stay in the musicians' houses.

529
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,320
 They have to cook for you.

530
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,320
 That sounds good.

531
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,320
 Yeah, they cook all your meals and then they go and perform.

532
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,320
 It's a big deal.

533
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,320
 Timothy Leary was very into it.

534
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,320
 Was he?

535
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,320
 Yeah, William Burroughs.

536
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,320
 All your guys.

537
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,320
 Yeah, so we're talking counterculture, 1950s kind of period.

538
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,320
 That kind of thing.

539
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,320
 Yeah.

540
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,320
 The guy who's chasing the children, is he trying to beat them?

541
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,320
 Because normally if you say, "I want to offer you an olive branch," it's a nice thing.

542
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,320
 No, no, it's scary.

543
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,320
 It's scary.

544
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,320
 Yeah, he's going for a beating.

545
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:01,320
 But I'm sure it's mostly just acted out at this point unless they've been really naughty.

546
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:05,320
 It's interesting you mentioned beats because I was talking to, so my best friend is Ash Gardner.

547
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,320
 He wrote the theme tune to know such thing as a fish.

548
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,320
 So "Empra, Yes."

549
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,320
 It's the song called "Wasps."

550
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:17,320
 After he released that album, they were approached by Superdrug because Superdrug wanted to make

551
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:21,320
 the ultimate electronic song to make love to.

552
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,320
 Wait, Superdrug the chemist?

553
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,320
 Yeah, yeah.

554
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,320
 And yeah, when I did that in Superdrug, I got kicked out.

555
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:35,320
 Yeah, they approached Ash and said, "We want to commission you to write a song that couples can make love to."

556
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,320
 Was it to sell condoms?

557
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,320
 It was about to lose weight.

558
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:44,320
 It was about being healthy while you're in bed.

559
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,320
 So this is how they described it.

560
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,320
 What was he talking about?

561
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,320
 This is Ash.

562
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,320
 How has this ever come up?

563
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:55,320
 He wrote our theme tune and then he wrote "Sexercise," which is the song.

564
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,320
 This is the description.

565
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:03,320
 "As written by Superdrug for the release, 'Sexercise' is something of a sonic epic at 22 minutes long.

566
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:09,320
 This is a melting pot of ideas and experimentation, a synth-laden exploration of pure passion."

567
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:13,320
 And there's a few comments underneath that one guy was like, "Doesn't do it for me, dog."

568
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,320
 And it's pretty weird.

569
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,320
 But they got paid really well for it.

570
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:24,320
 What they were told was there's the BPM that is best for being in bed doing the act.

571
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,320
 And that's why the obesity epidemic ended, wasn't it, when everyone started shagging?

572
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,320
 He said years ago that sex only burns off the number of calories in, what was it?

573
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,320
 It was one small meringue without sugar.

574
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,320
 It was one small sugar-free meringue.

575
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,320
 I think there are ways of having sex where you can gain calories.

576
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,320
 I don't really spend time how you do it, doesn't it?

577
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:56,320
 It is time for fact number three.

578
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,320
 And that is James.

579
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:06,320
 My fact this week is that children could learn to read faster if all lessons were held in a podcast studio.

580
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,320
 This is a study that was done in Japan.

581
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:15,320
 And the idea was they got a couple of classrooms and one of them that they really soundproofed

582
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:18,320
 and the other one was just a normal classroom.

583
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,320
 And they found that the children did much, much better in the soundproofed room.

584
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:27,320
 The idea is that when you're trying to learn how to read or learn how to speak, you're listening to your teacher

585
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,320
 and you're trying to work out what they're saying.

586
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,320
 But when there's loads of echoing around, you can't really hear it all properly.

587
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:37,320
 And also with very, very young kids, you might get one of the kids gets a bit upset

588
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:41,320
 and they start making noise and then the teacher has to go louder and then the kids go louder

589
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:45,320
 and you get all this feedback of just things getting louder and louder and much more difficult to understand what's going on.

590
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:49,320
 And so they tried this and they found that actually children did much better

591
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,320
 and even the teachers found it much easier as well.

592
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:55,320
 The teachers found their job just way easier because they weren't having to fight against the echo.

593
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,320
 So interesting. Yeah, really good.

594
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:01,320
 So when you say soundproof, you mean putting soft furnishings and mattresses everywhere.

595
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:05,320
 Yeah, so, I mean, how many people in the audience here today?

596
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:09,320
 1,500 people or whatever? Probably most of you have a podcast, I think.

597
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:13,320
 But when you're doing a podcast, you have to try and make it the room as unequally as possible.

598
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,320
 So you've closed your curtains.

599
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,320
 Velour cushions.

600
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,320
 All that kind of stuff.

601
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:21,320
 I thought you guys were doing that to try and seduce me. All these years.

602
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,320
 Oh, it's very cool, the sound quality thing.

603
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:29,320
 Because there was a study done this year, I think, about, I mean, obviously everyone uses Zoom now.

604
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:35,320
 And if you use Zoom with a bad or a cheap microphone, it turns out people literally think you are stupider.

605
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:43,320
 You could be the cleverest person in the Zoom, but if you don't have a good microphone, others genuinely downgrade you.

606
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,320
 How interesting.

607
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,320
 And it's, you know, and it can, it applies to sort of everything.

608
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:53,320
 So it's, you're less clever if you've got a bad microphone or you're thought to be, or less hireable if it's a job interview, less datable.

609
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,320
 If you're doing school Zoom dating.

610
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,320
 And it's just microphone quality.

611
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,320
 Really? Yeah.

612
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,320
 Again, we should emphasize just on Zoom, don't go to live interviews with your own microphone or anything.

613
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,320
 We're not recommending that, are we?

614
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,320
 But we wouldn't want the kids to learn in these studios because it would put podcasters out of business.

615
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:13,320
 And podcasting is a great industry, Cross2Wire's Festival, I think we agree.

616
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:17,320
 Named, kind of named accidentally.

617
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,320
 I mostly say because Andy likes an accidental invention.

618
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,320
 Oh yeah.

619
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,320
 So named in 2004 and named after iPods.

620
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:30,320
 There was a software engineer, Dave Weiner, who started the first podcast for a journalist called Christopher Lydden.

621
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:37,320
 And he created a program called iPodder, which was called that because it was made to deliver online broadcasts straight to iPods.

622
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:44,320
 And then a guy called Ben Hammersley wrote a piece in The Guardian about this new audio medium, which was to be called podcast.

623
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:49,320
 And he went to his editors and they said, "It's great. Just need a bit of padding. Can you shove it in a relevant sentence somewhere?"

624
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:58,320
 So he said at the top, he wrote kind of a facile sentence saying, "Oh, what to call this? Audio blogging, podcasting, guerrilla media?"

625
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,320
 And they caught on from there. Just a stupid bit of filler.

626
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:12,320
 What's interesting is September 28th, 2004, there was a blogger called Doc Searls, and he went to track the number of hits that Google would return if he wrote podcast into there.

627
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,320
 The first time he says 24 times, reportedly. And then it starts to get bigger.

628
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:22,320
 By the end of September, there are 2,750 hits on Google coming back for podcast.

629
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:28,320
 An exact year later, the 28th of September, 2005, over 100 million.

630
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,320
 And you know who was really pissed off about it? Microsoft.

631
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:38,320
 Because obviously you've got the pod from iPod, so every time someone said podcasting, it was basically an advert for Apple.

632
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:45,320
 And so Microsoft tried to use their own name. They all called them blockcasts until everyone in the world went, "No, we're not calling them that."

633
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:51,320
 That's not a good name. You know, a quarter of podcasts have one episode.

634
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,320
 Oh, really?

635
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,320
 And I think it's 65% and have fewer than 10.

636
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,320
 A lot of people say it should be higher, those proportions.

637
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:03,320
 I read an article by a company called Buzzsprout, who's a free podcast host.

638
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:10,320
 And they said, "If your new episode gets within seven days, 28 downloads, you're in the top 50% of podcasts."

639
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,320
 Wow.

640
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,320
 So we can get that one day.

641
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,320
 Yes.

642
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,320
 We can dream.

643
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,320
 George Bush was a forerunner in the World Podcasting.

644
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,320
 George Bush.

645
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,320
 George Bush.

646
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,320
 George Bush is senior weirdly, yeah.

647
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,320
 Very rare to have a double Bush podcast. Nice.

648
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,320
 Double Bush and a beaver.

649
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:37,320
 This was George Bush the younger, and he released his presidential weekly address as a podcast in the kind of latest 2000, I think 2008-ish, which was pretty impressive.

650
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:41,320
 And he used to sometimes deliver it in Spanish, which is like good on him.

651
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:47,320
 But then I watched a little interview with one of his Hispanic colleagues who remembered that journalists would come up to him all the time and say,

652
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:51,320
 "Isn't it great that your colleague, the president, George Bush, speaks Spanish as well?"

653
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:55,320
 And he said he never wanted to say to them, "He doesn't speak Spanish."

654
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,320
 He wasn't just making it up.

655
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:02,320
 He does try to speak Spanish, he said, and that's good enough.

656
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:08,320
 There's quite a few podcasts out there when you look into the history of it that arguably are the first podcast.

657
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:14,320
 I tried to look into it, accidentally found out the oldest podcaster in theory, as in current age.

658
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,320
 And there's a guy. There was an article that went out this year.

659
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,320
 He's 100 years old, and he has started making a podcast.

660
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:26,320
 He's called George Hall, and he was Lawrence Olivier's voice coach.

661
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,320
 So cool.

662
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:36,320
 Yeah, so he's basically dishing interesting anecdotes about Lord Olivier, his wife, people that he knew.

663
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:44,320
 Apparently, in one of the interviews, he says that Olivier was going through a phase of being absolutely obsessed about colonic irrigation.

664
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:49,320
 This is the kind of juice we're getting from George Hall at this point.

665
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,320
 We should mention the elephant in the room in the podcasting world.

666
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,320
 Joe Rogan, have you heard of it? Big deal.

667
00:31:55,320 --> 00:32:00,320
 If you listen to Joe Rogan, which someone in the audience just said, "Nope."

668
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:07,320
 Well, lots of people do, but if you do listen to it, American women will be less interested in you as a partner.

669
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:11,320
 And this was a survey that was done.

670
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:18,320
 It's another beard and moustache situation. Everyone thinks it makes the moral traction.

671
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,320
 Is it for men or is it for, yeah?

672
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,320
 American women between 18 and 34 were surveyed about what was a turn-off for them.

673
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:27,320
 So 55% said definite turn-off in a partner if they listened to Joe Rogan.

674
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:31,320
 I just thought some of the other turn-offs were quite interesting about where we are, like societally.

675
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:35,320
 They send green texts. That's a red flag for 7% of women.

676
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,320
 What is that about recycling?

677
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:41,320
 I think it's not having an iPhone. I think it's sort of that.

678
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,320
 Instead of the blue ones if you're on an iPhone.

679
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,320
 Then there were some very weird red flags.

680
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,320
 "Researching for best deals and rates before buying."

681
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:53,320
 2% of American women said, "No, that's not for me."

682
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:57,320
 They read. 1% said, "Red flag."

683
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:01,320
 They look better in person. 1% said, "Red flag."

684
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,320
 Interesting.

685
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:07,320
 Whereas when men, American men of the same age were asked about women,

686
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:12,320
 for them the biggest red flag they identify as a communist. 64% red flag.

687
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,320
 You've got to keep those red flags fired, haven't you?

688
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:24,320
 I think it's hard, the earliest podcast, because basically before podcasts you had distributing cassette tapes around the place.

689
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,320
 I feel like that was the original podcast, was bootleg cassette tapes.

690
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:33,320
 Because the thing about podcasting is that you're free of all the constraints of having to produce a show which has all this oversight, right?

691
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:38,320
 That's why there's so much shit out there, it's because there's kind of no standards imposed.

692
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:44,320
 Again, we want to say that podcasting is a great industry and that this festival does really good jobs.

693
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,320
 Of course, yes, all of that stuff.

694
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:51,320
 But Russia did a strong line in that, I hadn't realised during the Cold War.

695
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:58,320
 So there was Samizdat in Russia, which was the quite famous distribution of the written word.

696
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:03,320
 It was banned stuff, exactly, like soldier needs in or banned authors.

697
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:08,320
 You'd type things out endlessly and then you'd send them to your friends and they'd retype them and send them to their friends.

698
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:13,320
 And then there was this thing called Magnitizdat, which was publishing by tape recorder.

699
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:18,320
 And I think this is the original podcasting where basically you record yourself into a tape saying,

700
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,320
 "I'm not a huge Russian fan or something, don't like Stalin."

701
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,320
 And then you'd send it to your mates and you'd say,

702
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,320
 "Can you listen to this and then make a copy of it and send it to your friends?"

703
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:34,320
 And for some of these broadcasts, millions of people would end up hearing, apparently, which seems incredible.

704
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,320
 Patrons saying to podcasting?

705
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,320
 We have one?

706
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,320
 We do.

707
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,320
 Well, it's unofficial.

708
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,320
 It was organised by some trainee priests in Birmingham.

709
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,320
 [laughter]

710
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:50,320
 But they named Saint George Pricker as the unofficial patron saint of podcasting

711
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,320
 because he worked sort of spreading the values of the gospel

712
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,320
 and he would send out lots of books and prayer booklets

713
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,320
 and he did lots of talking to people and that kind of thing.

714
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,320
 So he's a real saint?

715
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,320
 He's a real person.

716
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,320
 He's a real person.

717
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:11,320
 His miracle that made him a saint was that he saw a 12-year-old boy pushing a cart full of manure

718
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:15,320
 and then when he went to help him, he put his hand on the cart

719
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:19,320
 and felt an extraordinary spiritual sweetness from the manure.

720
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,320
 Wow.

721
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,320
 Also, what?

722
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:26,320
 I don't know why pushing shit around makes you a patron saint of podcasting, but...

723
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:31,320
 Well, also, he did a miraculous thing where he was able to get you 20% off your express VPN

724
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,320
 whenever you put in an offer code.

725
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,320
 Do you know there is a thing now?

726
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:39,320
 This is a practice that's going on where people are setting up entire podcasts

727
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,320
 so that they can secure business meetings.

728
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:45,320
 So if you want to get in touch with someone in your industry who you admire

729
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:49,320
 and you might write to them on LinkedIn, you might send them a cold email

730
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,320
 and you might never hear from them.

731
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,320
 But if you write to them and say, "Would you like to appear on my podcast?"

732
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,320
 there's a much bigger chance they'll say, "Oh yeah, I'd love to."

733
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,320
 Wow.

734
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,320
 So people are just setting up entire podcasts which have like four listeners

735
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,320
 simply because it's a prestigious thing to be asked to do.

736
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,320
 Yeah.

737
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,320
 I thought that was why we were doing it.

738
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,320
 I can't even remember who we were trying to meet.

739
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,320
 Hey guys, I need to move us on to our next fact.

740
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,320
 Can I tell you one last good podcast name?

741
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,320
 Yeah.

742
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,320
 There's a podcast all about the horses in Lord of the Rings.

743
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,320
 Each episode is up to three hours long.

744
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,320
 I just love the name.

745
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,320
 Horses in Lord of the Rings.

746
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,320
 The title of the podcast is Shadow Facts.

747
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,320
 That is good.

748
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,320
 Lovely.

749
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:40,320
 All right, we need to get to our final fact of the show and that is Anna.

750
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:46,320
 My fact this week is that Second World War bombings were useful for freeing up parking spaces.

751
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:52,320
 So every cloud, I think you'll find.

752
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:58,320
 This, yeah, it's hard to get the quantity, but basically in Second World War,

753
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,320
 you may or may not know there was quite a lot of aerial bombing campaigns.

754
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,320
 The Blitz being a famous example.

755
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:09,320
 And what that did was flatten a lot of buildings and leave an enormous amount of space in the middle of cities

756
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:15,320
 where, well, for example, the big car parking franchise, NCP Car Parks in the UK,

757
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:19,320
 they founded their first car park on a bomb site in Red Lion Square in Hoban.

758
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,320
 That was in 1948 and lots more followed.

759
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:27,320
 And if you watch kind of bulletins at the time, there was kind of a panic in the 1950s

760
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:31,320
 because car ownership was going up and up that there wouldn't be any parking spaces left.

761
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:37,320
 But I was watching a bulletin saying, fortunately, at the moment, we've got so many massive bomb sites

762
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:42,320
 with no buildings on them that we have managed to find space to park all the cars until now.

763
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:47,320
 But if we don't have another bombing campaign soon, we'll have nowhere to put the cars.

764
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,320
 They didn't say that, but it was implied.

765
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,320
 It's incredible the story of that first car park.

766
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,320
 Okay, this is really fun, I promise.

767
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,320
 And if you doubt it halfway through, just remember, it is really, really fun.

768
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,320
 Okay, that one in Red Lion Square in Hoban.

769
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,320
 So, 1948, founded by two guys called Donald Gosling and Ronald Hobson,

770
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,320
 and they were told, this will never work.

771
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:14,320
 That's a stupid idea. You can park on the side of the road anytime,

772
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:19,320
 and no one's going to pay one shilling and sixpence for an entire day's parking in central London.

773
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,320
 They were just told, don't do it.

774
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,320
 I'm just sorry to cut you off, but how many cars did we have at the time?

775
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,320
 Was it a problem parking?

776
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,320
 They did it now, right? They're very useful.

777
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,320
 You could just park on the side of the street in most places.

778
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,320
 So, we didn't really need it.

779
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,320
 You could park on Oxford Street.

780
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,320
 But they were going up very fast.

781
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,320
 Post-war car ownership was going up.

782
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,320
 Anyway, this is going to get fun, is it?

783
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:41,320
 Well, I'm now slightly doubting that.

784
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,320
 Anyway, they bought it for 200 quid, 100 quid each they put in.

785
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,320
 They bought this space for a car park.

786
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:48,320
 They sold the business 50 years later in 1998.

787
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,320
 Each of them got 300 million pounds from the sale.

788
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,320
 Wow!

789
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,320
 There was more than one car park by that point.

790
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,320
 That's a good effect, yeah.

791
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,320
 The whole business was sold for 800 million pounds.

792
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,320
 Wow!

793
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,320
 They nearly didn't sell the business.

794
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,320
 It nearly fell over at the very last moment,

795
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,320
 because Ronald Hobson, one of the two co-founders,

796
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,320
 he wanted one particular car park to be excluded from the sale

797
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,320
 because it was on Oxford Street

798
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,320
 and he wanted it to be excluded from the sale

799
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,320
 because he would go there at the weekend

800
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,320
 and park up with a flask of tea

801
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,320
 and study which parking bays were occupied first.

802
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,320
 Wow!

803
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,320
 So he wanted that to be like...

804
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,320
 That is fascinating.

805
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,320
 I know.

806
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,320
 Do we know the results?

807
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,320
 Okay, okay, okay.

808
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,320
 Sorry.

809
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,320
 I'm sorry for finding it so interesting, but...

810
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,320
 I don't know if you think who parks where first.

811
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,320
 Is it under the tree?

812
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,320
 Is it closest to the parking meter?

813
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,320
 I couldn't agree more on it.

814
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,320
 This is an interesting fact,

815
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,320
 but I feel like I've lost the room at this point.

816
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,320
 Oh my God.

817
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,320
 I think we're locked in.

818
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,320
 That is an interesting thing, right?

819
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,320
 So if you go into a car parking place,

820
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,320
 do you just park as soon as you go in

821
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,320
 where there's loads of spaces?

822
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,320
 Or do you drive as close to the door as possible

823
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,320
 and then drive around looking for the perfect spot?

824
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,320
 I do that.

825
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,320
 Yeah, so does almost everyone.

826
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,320
 It turns out that actually, on average,

827
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,320
 it kind of works out about even.

828
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,320
 Okay.

829
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,320
 But people have found that actually a lot of traffic

830
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,320
 in towns consists of people looking for spaces.

831
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:12,320
 And they did a study in the German city of Freiburg

832
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:16,320
 in the 2010s and found that 74% of cars

833
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,320
 at one moment were looking for a parking spot.

834
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,320
 Oh my God.

835
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,320
 It's mental, isn't it?

836
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,320
 Yeah, it's bad.

837
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,320
 A lot of pollution there.

838
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,320
 People cruising, it's called,

839
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,320
 which is much less sexy version of cruising

840
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,320
 than other versions of cruising.

841
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:35,320
 No, I'm cruising officer.

842
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,320
 There are some countries in the world

843
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,320
 with some really mad parking systems.

844
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,320
 I don't think we've mentioned before.

845
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,320
 Quite a lot of countries,

846
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,320
 the cold ones mostly,

847
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,320
 how systems where you have to park on one side of the road

848
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,320
 or the other so that they can sweep the snow

849
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,320
 off the non-parked-on side.

850
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,320
 And they have different ways of signifying this,

851
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,320
 but Sweden's is so good.

852
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:57,320
 It's called their datum park herring system.

853
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:01,320
 And it's exemplified by a post on Reddit I read

854
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,320
 from an American tourist saying,

855
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,320
 "Sorry for the dumb question,

856
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,320
 but we really can't make sense of this sign.

857
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,320
 We're on holiday in Sweden. Can we park here?"

858
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:12,320
 The sign is a vertical white line on one side of the sign

859
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:15,320
 and two vertical lines on the other side of the sign.

860
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:18,320
 The answer that a helpful Swedish resident gave was,

861
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,320
 it means you're not allowed to park on the side of the street

862
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,320
 with even or odd house numbers

863
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:26,320
 on correspondingly even or odd days.

864
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,320
 [laughter]

865
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,320
 So there you go.

866
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:34,320
 So you have to, if it's like the 11th of July,

867
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,320
 you have to make sure you're not parking on the side of the street

868
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:40,320
 that has houses numbers 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9.

869
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,320
 Simple, then you should know that

870
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,320
 the sign is three random lines on it.

871
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,320
 In America they have a lot of things like this.

872
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:50,320
 Quite a lot of towns, especially Pittsburgh apparently,

873
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:53,320
 they do this thing where if you go out for the day

874
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:56,320
 and you take your car, then you'll put a chair where your car was

875
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,320
 so that no one can park there.

876
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,320
 Oh yeah.

877
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,320
 And they're not really supposed to do it,

878
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:04,320
 but really the local cops, they just turn a blind eye.

879
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,320
 Like outside your house?

880
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,320
 Yeah, so you've gone out to the shops,

881
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,320
 but you don't want anyone to park right outside your house.

882
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,320
 You've got a chair there and then no one else will park it.

883
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,320
 And everyone kind of knows that that's the way that we do things.

884
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,320
 And then according to the economists,

885
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,320
 in Shanghai they do the same thing,

886
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:22,320
 but people get their elderly relatives to sit in parking spaces.

887
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,320
 No chair?

888
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,320
 I've seen there is a chair.

889
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,320
 There's a granny on the ground.

890
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,320
 I was reading about UK car parks

891
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:35,320
 and I found that in 2004, Focus, the science magazine,

892
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:40,320
 they were given a brief to come up with the ten most secure places on Earth.

893
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:43,320
 And those places included Saddam's Baghdad Bunker,

894
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:48,320
 the Mormon Church Records, Fort Knox, Air Force One,

895
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:52,320
 and a car park in Derby called Bald Lane.

896
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,320
 Right?

897
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:56,320
 And you know how I was an hour late for the podcast today?

898
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,320
 That's where you went?

899
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,320
 That's where I was.

900
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,320
 Oh my God!

901
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,320
 You went to the highest secure place in the UK basically?

902
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,320
 Yeah, well I was driving past it.

903
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,320
 What is it?

904
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:08,320
 It's the most secure car park in the world.

905
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,320
 What does that mean?

906
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:12,320
 There's a big sign that says this is the most secure car park in the world.

907
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,320
 What does it mean?

908
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:16,320
 I should say it's in Derby, not Derby.

909
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,320
 Did I say Derby?

910
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,320
 You said Derby.

911
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,320
 Wow.

912
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,320
 But it's amazing.

913
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,320
 So you go in and they give you this card

914
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:27,320
 and then you park in the thing and they have sensors underneath your car.

915
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:30,320
 And when you leave, you say which bay you're in

916
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,320
 and then the sensor switches on.

917
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:35,320
 And if anyone moves your car before you come back

918
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,320
 then the whole place locks down.

919
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,320
 No.

920
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,320
 Yeah, absolutely.

921
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:42,320
 And there are 190 CCTV cameras in the building.

922
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,320
 They have a huge PA system.

923
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,320
 They have panic buttons all the way through.

924
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,320
 So anywhere you go, you could just bang the panic button.

925
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,320
 Again, everything shuts down.

926
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,320
 Did you do it?

927
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,320
 Oh, boom!

928
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,320
 Why do you think I was an hour late?

929
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:57,320
 No, it's absolutely amazing.

930
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,320
 And what happened was, it was in 1997,

931
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,320
 there was a load of crime that was happening there.

932
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:04,320
 There was a lot of drug taking and muggings and stuff like that.

933
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,320
 And the council didn't really know what to do.

934
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,320
 And so they got this guy called Ken Wigley,

935
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:11,320
 who had invented a load of security systems

936
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,320
 and said, "Do you want to take over it?"

937
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:16,320
 And he said, "Well, I'll take over it as long as I can do whatever I want."

938
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,320
 And he just basically put all these amazing systems in.

939
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,320
 He's like Judge Dredd, but for parking.

940
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,320
 This is so amazing.

941
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,320
 So if you've parked your car there, you're busy shopping,

942
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,320
 you've bumped into your partner in town, you give them the car keys,

943
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,320
 you say, "Darling, I parked the car, can you pick it up?"

944
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:31,320
 That's it. They're arrested.

945
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:34,320
 As long as they've got the car, they're okay.

946
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,320
 Okay, fine.

947
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:40,320
 So you can walk around Derby and go to as many vape shops and bookmakers as you want.

948
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,320
 Really?

949
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,320
 And your car will be absolutely safe.

950
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,320
 Wow.

951
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:47,320
 I think I know one which is as secure.

952
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,320
 I don't think you'll have found this, Dan.

953
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,320
 Okay.

954
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:54,320
 There is a car park in Farnborough that is only accessible on foot.

955
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,320
 That's brilliant.

956
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,320
 This was reported...

957
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,320
 This is for the Flintstones.

958
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:07,320
 This was reported several years ago, and I had a look on Google Images.

959
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:10,320
 Certainly the most recent image shows no cars there.

960
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:14,320
 It's above the gym. The business is called the gym, I'm not just being vague.

961
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:17,320
 When it was first reported, it had absolutely everything.

962
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:19,320
 It's got bays, it's got signs, it's got all of that.

963
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,320
 But the only thing it lacked was access for a car.

964
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:25,320
 And that's because it's part of a big development which hasn't been finished yet.

965
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:29,320
 So you can go there to this day, but just not with a car.

966
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,320
 Wow.

967
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,320
 That is secure in the other way, you can't get in.

968
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:35,320
 I thought it was going to be a clever system where you had to lift your own car in or something.

969
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:39,320
 Like I was actually in Spain a couple of weeks ago, we went into an underground car park.

970
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:43,320
 And instead of parking your own car someone stopped us and said, "I'll park your car for you."

971
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,320
 And the system is you get out of your car.

972
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,320
 I've fallen for that so many times.

973
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,320
 I've fallen for the number of cars I've been through.

974
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:52,320
 You're on the 19th car this year.

975
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,320
 You've given me your keys and you watch.

976
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,320
 And they go up to a parking space.

977
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,320
 And the parking spaces are so narrow to save space, presumably,

978
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:03,320
 that they then get out of the car before parking it, take the handbrake off and push it in

979
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,320
 so that they don't have to get out of the doors afterwards.

980
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:06,320
 So cool.

981
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:11,320
 And it also reminded me of another cool system they have in Thailand where you are...

982
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,320
 And I discovered this because my friend lived in Thailand

983
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:16,320
 and she came back to pick up her car one day in a multi-storey car park.

984
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:20,320
 There was another car parked in front and a Thai person nearby explained,

985
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,320
 "That's fine. They will have left the handbrake on."

986
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:25,320
 And in Thailand, you can park blocking people in

987
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:28,320
 as long as you leave the handbrake off so that when they arrive,

988
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:31,320
 they can push your car out of the way and get their car out.

989
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,320
 That's amazing. So good.

990
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:34,320
 That's very funny.

991
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,320
 A few things on the Blitz.

992
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:39,320
 So the Blitz London gets a lot of the headlines,

993
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:43,320
 but the rest of the country was hit and of course Sheffield was hit quite badly

994
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:48,320
 because according to JBS Haldane, there was a half a square mile of Sheffield

995
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:53,320
 that was more vital for production of munitions than anywhere else in Britain.

996
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:57,320
 Basically, it was the only place in the UK where you made these armor-piercing shells in Sheffield

997
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:00,320
 and so the Germans were really, really keen to bomb it.

998
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:04,320
 It was called Schmitzstegel, which means crucible.

999
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:07,320
 And basically, yeah, the whole city got hit quite badly.

1000
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:10,320
 There was a woman who was fined £3

1001
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:13,320
 because even though she blacked out her house curtains before leaving,

1002
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,320
 she'd left a light on which she weren't allowed to do

1003
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:17,320
 because the bombers would be able to see it.

1004
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:18,320
 Right.

1005
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,320
 She said she'd left the light on for her cat

1006
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:24,320
 and the cat had moved the curtains to kind of...

1007
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,320
 It could have been a German cat, I'm thinking.

1008
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,320
 Sounds like it.

1009
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:32,320
 And the hospital, the top brass, they all had tin hats

1010
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:35,320
 but the nurses had to make do with chamber pots on their heads

1011
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,320
 that was held on with sandwiches.

1012
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,320
 There's amazing pictures of them doing that.

1013
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:43,320
 And they would go out to the moors and they would collect sphagnum moss,

1014
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:47,320
 which they would use...

1015
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:51,320
 If you know, you know.

1016
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:54,320
 They would use to sterilise wounds and stuff like that.

1017
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,320
 So yeah, wow.

1018
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:59,320
 I read a couple of headlines about the Sheffield Blitz.

1019
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:02,320
 There was a fact from the Sheffield Star which wrote,

1020
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:05,320
 "Sheffield has braced themselves for air attack from the moment war was declared.

1021
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:08,320
 "People couldn't understand why Sheffield was not hit sooner."

1022
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,320
 Very much like...

1023
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,320
 Come on.

1024
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,320
 I love this line so much.

1025
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:18,320
 "Yorkshire soldiers were reported to have pledged to avenge Hitler's raids on the city.

1026
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:23,320
 "He made a bad mistake bombing Sheffield," they said.

1027
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:25,320
 Like, that's just quite... That's very nice and proud.

1028
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:28,320
 I do think invading Russia was the bigger mistake of the war.

1029
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:29,320
 But like, Sheffield was...

1030
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,320
 It's Honest Deathbed, biggest regret.

1031
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,320
 Sheffield.

1032
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,320
 Okay, that is it. That is all of our facts.

1033
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,320
 Thank you so much for listening.

1034
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,320
 Thank you to the CrossWire Festival.

1040

1043
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:06,480
 (upbeat music)
