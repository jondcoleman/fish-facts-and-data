00:00:11,00:00:16,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing"
00:00:16,00:00:20,"as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week coming to you live"
00:00:20,00:00:23,from the Crossed Wires Festival in Sheffield.
00:00:23,00:00:31,[CHEERING]
00:00:31,00:00:33,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:33,00:00:36,"I am sitting here with Anna Toshinsky, Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:36,00:00:37,and James Harkin.
00:00:37,00:00:40,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:40,00:00:43,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:00:43,00:00:46,"and in no particular order, here we go,"
00:00:46,00:00:49,"starting with fact number one, and that is Andy."
00:00:49,00:00:52,"My fact is, in the 19th century, some Hungarian cavalry"
00:00:52,00:00:55,officers got extra pay specifically
00:00:55,00:00:58,because they had to spend so much money on wax
00:00:58,00:01:02,for their enormous moustaches.
00:01:02,00:01:08,So we have on the screen here an enormous military moustache.
00:01:08,00:01:11,"This was the age of the moustache, the 19th century."
00:01:11,00:01:15,"There was an officer called the Hussar, very impressive."
00:01:15,00:01:19,"The Hungarian Hussars were the pride of Europe, amazing."
00:01:19,00:01:21,"And there was a writer called John Padgett,"
00:01:21,00:01:23,"who was touring Europe in the 1830s,"
00:01:23,00:01:25,and he was in Hungary.
00:01:25,00:01:28,He reported they were up to a foot long these moustaches.
00:01:28,00:01:30,"They were just incredibly stiff and waxed,"
00:01:30,00:01:32,and there was supposedly a little extra stipend
00:01:32,00:01:34,for buying your moustache wax.
00:01:34,00:01:35,Do you think it's--
00:01:35,00:01:37,An advantage of someone shooting at you
00:01:37,00:01:38,because you're a bigger target.
00:01:38,00:01:41,"They might hit the moustache, and it doesn't hurt so much."
00:01:41,00:01:43,Yes.
00:01:43,00:01:44,"Yes, I do."
00:01:44,00:01:45,Interesting theory.
00:01:45,00:01:48,"You say yes, you do, but I'm not getting that vibe from you."
00:01:48,00:01:51,I think it's an interesting thing because John Padgett
00:01:51,00:01:53,"was going around, and he was interviewing people over there."
00:01:53,00:01:57,"And they were saying, the idea of not having a moustache at all,"
00:01:57,00:01:59,"let alone a ginormous one that required wax,"
00:01:59,00:02:02,was an alien notion to some of them.
00:02:02,00:02:04,"They were like, that is what men literally have."
00:02:04,00:02:06,You are not a man unless you have a moustache.
00:02:06,00:02:09,How do you distinguish between men and women in the UK
00:02:09,00:02:10,is what they were asking.
00:02:10,00:02:12,There are other ways.
00:02:12,00:02:13,They never found them.
00:02:13,00:02:16,And that's why the Hungarian population has died out.
00:02:16,00:02:18,"In the 19th century, around the time this is happening,"
00:02:18,00:02:22,a lot of people are trying to prove various ethnic boundaries
00:02:22,00:02:24,"and saying, these people are from one race."
00:02:24,00:02:26,These people were from another race.
00:02:26,00:02:27,It was a big time for that.
00:02:27,00:02:29,"But a lot of them, I was reading articles,"
00:02:29,00:02:31,they really struggled with Hungarians
00:02:31,00:02:33,because they couldn't compare their mouths
00:02:33,00:02:35,because they couldn't see their mouths
00:02:35,00:02:37,because they had such massive moustaches.
00:02:37,00:02:39,"There was a quote, ""The machas,"" which is the Hungarians,"
00:02:39,00:02:41,"are not only a moustachioed people,"
00:02:41,00:02:43,but also one that is proud of a moustache
00:02:43,00:02:48,that recognizes it as a basic element of honor and respectability.
00:02:48,00:02:50,That's amazing as well because you'd never have to worry
00:02:50,00:02:52,"about someone lip-reading you, right?"
00:02:52,00:02:54,There's just a wall of hair stopping.
00:02:54,00:02:56,But it doesn't grow out of your mouth.
00:02:56,00:02:58,"No, but Anna..."
00:02:58,00:03:00,"Can it grow down over it, really?"
00:03:00,00:03:01,"Yeah, you can get one of the waterfall ones."
00:03:01,00:03:05,"Those are lovely, you know, they're like curtains, yeah."
00:03:05,00:03:07,"They don't sound lovely,"
00:03:07,00:03:08,but I think there often is a disparity
00:03:08,00:03:10,between what women think of moustaches
00:03:10,00:03:11,in terms of how attractive they are
00:03:11,00:03:13,and what men think of them.
00:03:13,00:03:17,"But it definitely caught on, didn't it, in military trends."
00:03:17,00:03:20,"In fact, it was uniform regulation in the British Army"
00:03:20,00:03:24,"from 1860 that every soldier should have short hair on their head,"
00:03:24,00:03:27,"no hair on their chin, but hair on their upper lip."
00:03:27,00:03:30,And I think it started with the East India Company
00:03:30,00:03:35,"and British soldiers went to India where, as is the case today,"
00:03:35,00:03:36,"they are the world leaders in moustaches,"
00:03:36,00:03:38,"I would say, probably."
00:03:38,00:03:40,And it was a real mark of manliness
00:03:40,00:03:42,for an Indian person to have a moustache.
00:03:42,00:03:44,"So they weren't going to respect, you know,"
00:03:44,00:03:46,British Army officers unless they did.
00:03:46,00:03:49,And so then I think it spread from there and everyone had to have one.
00:03:49,00:03:49,Everyone had to have one.
00:03:49,00:03:52,"And also in some countries, it was illegal to have one"
00:03:52,00:03:53,if you were not in the military
00:03:53,00:03:56,because you're basically impersonating a soldier.
00:03:56,00:03:58,Are we talking 19th century or is it...
00:03:58,00:04:01,"I don't think this is still in force, no."
00:04:01,00:04:05,"Actually, a lot of the rules about wearing moustaches of the army"
00:04:05,00:04:07,are not enforced anymore and it was World War One
00:04:07,00:04:10,and it was because you had to put gas masks on.
00:04:10,00:04:12,You can't get a proper seal on if you have a moustache.
00:04:12,00:04:14,"Yes, but this is exciting."
00:04:14,00:04:17,There's new news from the British military on moustaches
00:04:17,00:04:19,"as of last year, and beards."
00:04:19,00:04:22,So my friend is in the army and I rang him up and asked him about this.
00:04:22,00:04:25,"And it turns out, April last year, I think,"
00:04:25,00:04:29,"finally the British Army, you're allowed to have a beard."
00:04:29,00:04:31,"- Oh, thank God. - I know."
00:04:31,00:04:34,"Before last April, you could have a moustache."
00:04:34,00:04:36,"That was fine, but a beard was absolutely not."
00:04:36,00:04:39,There were Queen's regs on sideburns.
00:04:39,00:04:43,Not like they could only come down a certain proportion of your ear.
00:04:43,00:04:45,I just imagine in that episode of The Simpsons
00:04:45,00:04:48,when Mr Burns doesn't know what sideburns are.
00:04:48,00:04:52,"I know I'm just referencing another TV show there, but..."
00:04:52,00:04:54,"Yeah, but this has been changed, and finally..."
00:04:54,00:04:58,- That's really good. - ...the King himself intervened in this matter.
00:04:58,00:04:59,"- Did he? - Yeah, and you..."
00:04:59,00:05:02,"He's always got his finger on the hot-button issues, hasn't he?"
00:05:02,00:05:05,I'm not sure whether you're allowed currently in the army
00:05:05,00:05:07,to have a beard but no moustache.
00:05:07,00:05:10,"You're allowed a full set, so I don't know what the rules are."
00:05:10,00:05:12,"The rules were you basically couldn't do it,"
00:05:12,00:05:16,"but you could get an exemption for religious reasons, right?"
00:05:16,00:05:18,"If you were Sikh, for instance, you were allowed it."
00:05:18,00:05:20,"The few people in the army that were allowed it,"
00:05:20,00:05:24,"so like drum majors, pipe majors, bugle majors, goat majors,"
00:05:24,00:05:27,"which is people who love to have the goats,"
00:05:27,00:05:29,and pioneer sergeants.
00:05:29,00:05:31,Pioneer sergeants are amazing.
00:05:31,00:05:33,"They're people who would be at the front of a regimen,"
00:05:33,00:05:36,"and they would have a special apron that they wore,"
00:05:36,00:05:41,and their job was to clear the path for anyone who was walking behind them.
00:05:41,00:05:43,"- What? - And if someone's horse was wounded,"
00:05:43,00:05:47,"it was their job, I'm sorry about this, to kill the horse."
00:05:47,00:05:50,"- Right, boy. - And also, they would cut off one of the legs"
00:05:50,00:05:53,and give it to the soldier to carry with them
00:05:53,00:05:56,"because the animals had numbers branded on their hoof,"
00:05:56,00:05:59,and you had to take it back to prove that...
00:05:59,00:06:02,"I haven't just lost my horse, like I've got this bit of it."
00:06:02,00:06:04,"- Oh, wow. - It all sounds made up, doesn't it?"
00:06:04,00:06:06,"- That's amazing. - I was about to ask,"
00:06:06,00:06:09,why does he have an apron if his job is just going ahead of everyone else?
00:06:09,00:06:13,But now you've said that cutting horses up is part of the job.
00:06:13,00:06:16,"It's a good weapon if you need it, as well, a horse's leg."
00:06:16,00:06:19,"- If you want to have other stuff. - I think if you're in a cavalry charge,"
00:06:19,00:06:22,"and you're the one going, ""I'll foot with the horse's leg."""
00:06:22,00:06:24,I feel like I would have two of the horses leg
00:06:24,00:06:26,"and bang them together like coconuts,"
00:06:26,00:06:28,so the other me thought I was on my horse.
00:06:28,00:06:30,They'll think you're a coconut.
00:06:30,00:06:32,That's a very good idea.
00:06:32,00:06:35,"- Interestingly, the thing you were mentioning about gas masks is,"
00:06:35,00:06:37,"it was recently, in the last few years,"
00:06:37,00:06:40,it was learned that's the reason that Hitler ended up with his Hitler mustache.
00:06:40,00:06:43,"So he used to have a big, big mustache,"
00:06:43,00:06:45,and it didn't fit the regulations for the gas mask.
00:06:45,00:06:47,"- There's debate about this. - Yeah, absolutely."
00:06:47,00:06:50,But this is from a biographer who knew him at the time who writes it.
00:06:50,00:06:54,"So it's a kind of, it's a firsthand account of someone's opinion,"
00:06:54,00:06:56,"but absolutely, it's one of those contentious things."
00:06:56,00:06:59,- I thought he was harking back to old-school Prussian stuff.
00:06:59,00:07:01,"I should say this fact comes from an article about,"
00:07:01,00:07:03,"why don't politicians have mustaches anymore,"
00:07:03,00:07:06,"in which Hitler plays a key role, I would say."
00:07:06,00:07:08,(laughter)
00:07:08,00:07:12,"- So the other thing is, apparently pilots on airplanes"
00:07:12,00:07:14,have that similar thing about not having beards
00:07:14,00:07:17,because they have to be able to get the mask on
00:07:17,00:07:19,if they lose oxygen and the oxygen mask come down.
00:07:19,00:07:21,So it could catch on fire.
00:07:21,00:07:23,"- Hang on, when they give us the safety briefing at the start,"
00:07:23,00:07:25,"they never say, ""Quickly shave your beard off,"""
00:07:25,00:07:27,and then apply the oxygen mask.
00:07:27,00:07:30,It's actually like bearded to the goners.
00:07:30,00:07:32,- I think so too.
00:07:32,00:07:35,"- It really struck me that the battle between beards and moustache,"
00:07:35,00:07:37,"like they're on opposite sides of the fight, aren't they?"
00:07:37,00:07:39,"Because as soon as a beard becomes popular,"
00:07:39,00:07:41,a moustache is just part of a beard.
00:07:41,00:07:43,"Or in fact, and I really like this quote,"
00:07:43,00:07:46,there was a novelist called Frank Richardson in the 19th century
00:07:46,00:07:49,"who said, ""Moustaches get lost in the general face fungus."""
00:07:49,00:07:51,That is the popular beard.
00:07:51,00:07:54,So I think it was quite good for moustaches
00:07:54,00:07:57,when people like Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch
00:07:57,00:08:01,in the 19th century started to discover that bacteria caused infections
00:08:01,00:08:05,"because suddenly people were losing their beards left, right and centre"
00:08:05,00:08:08,because the idea was that lots of bacteria was going to get caught in them.
00:08:08,00:08:11,"And in fact, there was a 1907 experiment"
00:08:11,00:08:17,where they made a woman kiss a very hirsute on the face man
00:08:17,00:08:22,and found that he was polluted with tuberculosis and diphtheria bacteria
00:08:22,00:08:25,as well as food particles and a hair from a spider's leg.
00:08:25,00:08:29,Where did they get this man from?
00:08:29,00:08:32,It's just in every man.
00:08:32,00:08:35,"You've probably got all of that in your beard right now, James."
00:08:35,00:08:36,I don't deny it.
00:08:36,00:08:39,So this is a lot about men in the army and stuff like that
00:08:39,00:08:41,because we're talking about moustaches.
00:08:41,00:08:43,"But there is Manuela Seons,"
00:08:43,00:08:46,who's an Ecuadorian revolutionary female
00:08:46,00:08:48,who used to wear a moustache.
00:08:48,00:08:50,A false or...
00:08:50,00:08:51,"No, real."
00:08:51,00:08:53,"No, no, she didn't grow one."
00:08:53,00:08:55,She was in the battle of Ayacuchco.
00:08:55,00:08:57,"And as Prusa was there,"
00:08:57,00:09:00,she carried around the moustache that she'd taken off a dead enemy.
00:09:00,00:09:04,And she would wear it at masquerade balls.
00:09:04,00:09:08,So she would go around and wear this moustache as just Prusa.
00:09:08,00:09:10,This woman was one of Bolivar's people
00:09:10,00:09:14,and actually was in a relationship with Bolivar for a lot of the time.
00:09:14,00:09:17,Because I won the most important Ecuadorian revolutionaries.
00:09:17,00:09:19,It just feels very hard to take a moustache off someone you've...
00:09:19,00:09:22,That's quite an operation to shave off a...
00:09:22,00:09:25,I don't think you shave it off. I think it's more of a scalping issue.
00:09:25,00:09:27,"Yeah, it's got to come with the skin."
00:09:27,00:09:29,"Otherwise, how do you piece it back together?"
00:09:29,00:09:31,And I think it's a good move at a dance
00:09:31,00:09:33,because no one's going to refuse to get on your dance card
00:09:33,00:09:35,once you tell them the moustache you're wearing
00:09:35,00:09:38,belongs to the last bloke who refused to dance with you.
00:09:38,00:09:41,"Actually, there is some evidence that in the 19th century"
00:09:41,00:09:44,there was a trend for women to have a whiskery face.
00:09:44,00:09:46,"When whiskers became so popular,"
00:09:46,00:09:48,there were fashion journals that said
00:09:48,00:09:51,women would start wearing their locks of hair
00:09:51,00:09:53,down the side of their face where a man's sideburns
00:09:53,00:09:55,would be in imitation of men's sideburns
00:09:55,00:09:57,because they were so popular.
00:09:57,00:09:59,And there were adverts for pencils for women
00:09:59,00:10:01,to draw little whiskers on their cheeks.
00:10:01,00:10:04,And there was a dye advertised for women's whiskers.
00:10:04,00:10:06,Right.
00:10:06,00:10:08,So this is the thing why don't women
00:10:08,00:10:10,typically have as much facial hair as men?
00:10:10,00:10:12,What is going on?
00:10:12,00:10:14,Because there are all these reasons of why we've got hair on our head
00:10:14,00:10:16,which is some protection.
00:10:16,00:10:18,To keep you warm and stuff?
00:10:18,00:10:20,"To keep you warm, again, hair on your head,"
00:10:20,00:10:24,"warm thing, armpit hair and pubic hair is to reduce friction."
00:10:24,00:10:27,Also where I keep my tuberculosis.
00:10:27,00:10:29,Right.
00:10:29,00:10:32,So if these were reasons like friction and heat retention
00:10:32,00:10:34,"and keeping the sun off and all that,"
00:10:34,00:10:37,you would expect women to have full beards and moustaches as well.
00:10:37,00:10:40,Which means it's either something in female relationships
00:10:40,00:10:42,"or male-male relationships,"
00:10:42,00:10:45,in that it's either to attract and impress and excite women
00:10:45,00:10:49,or it's something to cow and repel rival men.
00:10:49,00:10:51,Do you know what I mean?
00:10:51,00:10:53,It's got to be the latter.
00:10:53,00:10:56,"Because as I say, the number of people I've come across,"
00:10:56,00:10:59,"no offence, I'm trying to count the bearded people in the audience now quickly."
00:10:59,00:11:02,I'm literally sitting next to you.
00:11:02,00:11:04,"I've come across so many people who are,"
00:11:04,00:11:07,"so there's Rod Littlewood who's vice president of the World Beard Association,"
00:11:07,00:11:10,"there's Steve Parsons of the British based Handlebar Club,"
00:11:10,00:11:12,"Handlebar Moustaches,"
00:11:12,00:11:15,the world record holder who's an Indian man for the longest moustache.
00:11:15,00:11:18,"All of their wives say, ""I didn't like it."""
00:11:18,00:11:21,I'd rather they didn't devote their entire lives.
00:11:21,00:11:24,"The poor wife of the Indian guy Ram Singh Chowhan said,"
00:11:24,00:11:27,"""For the first decade or so, I thought this is a really bad idea."
00:11:27,00:11:29,"I'm sort of repulsed."""
00:11:29,00:11:32,And then eventually as I realised he was building a career out of it.
00:11:32,00:11:34,"How long is his, sorry?"
00:11:34,00:11:37,So his is 14 foot long.
00:11:37,00:11:39,I think it's seven foot on each side.
00:11:39,00:11:41,That's long.
00:11:41,00:11:44,You could be in every room of the house at once.
00:11:44,00:11:48,But today you can send it to the fridge to get a beer for you.
00:11:48,00:11:50,That's nice.
00:11:50,00:11:53,Apparently dipping them in beer is good.
00:11:53,00:11:57,This is according to the Handlebar Club guy who says dip it in beer to keep it.
00:11:57,00:11:59,"Yeah, but what does his wife think?"
00:11:59,00:12:01,"Well, indeed."
00:12:01,00:12:04,There was a thing that said he's got a great comeback to his wife
00:12:04,00:12:06,who complains about his facial hair.
00:12:06,00:12:09,"He always says, ""I say kissing a man without a moustache"
00:12:09,00:12:11,is like drinking champagne without the bubbles.
00:12:11,00:12:14,"And I don't think that is a good comeback."""
00:12:14,00:12:17,"Well, you also like white wine."
00:12:17,00:12:19,"Yeah, you're right."
00:12:19,00:12:21,I think it is a men-to-men thing.
00:12:21,00:12:23,Right.
00:12:23,00:12:26,There was a piece in 1926 of the New York Times which claimed
00:12:26,00:12:28,"Ivan the Terrible, as Russians are,"
00:12:28,00:12:32,he liked a beard so well that he used to play by the hour
00:12:32,00:12:37,"with the flowing beaver of Queen Elizabeth's royal agent, George Killingworth."
00:12:37,00:12:39,That's something.
00:12:39,00:12:43,I'll ask on behalf of everyone.
00:12:43,00:12:46,The Royal Beaver.
00:12:46,00:12:49,With the flowing beaver of Queen Elizabeth's royal agent.
00:12:49,00:12:52,"Yeah, beaver is just another word for beard."
00:12:52,00:12:55,"Oh, that's all it is, guys."
00:12:55,00:12:57,And it's overdue a comeback.
00:12:57,00:12:59,We probably shouldn't talk about moustaches without mentioning
00:12:59,00:13:02,our colleague who's been on the podcast a few times.
00:13:02,00:13:04,Ann Miller is one of her favourite facts.
00:13:04,00:13:06,"She's got a huge moustache, hasn't she?"
00:13:06,00:13:08,She always likes his fact.
00:13:08,00:13:11,"Well, I'm going to ask, do you guys think that if you're in the CIA,"
00:13:11,00:13:13,should you keep a fake moustache on hand?
00:13:13,00:13:15,"Yeah, of course."
00:13:15,00:13:17,"No, not on your hand."
00:13:17,00:13:20,"Then you just put it up like that, and it's fine."
00:13:20,00:13:24,That's going to work great on a podcast.
00:13:24,00:13:26,We're not going to explain what Andy's doing even.
00:13:26,00:13:28,You can imagine.
00:13:28,00:13:30,But your imaginations run wild.
00:13:30,00:13:32,I'm putting a finger in front to be a flowing beaver.
00:13:32,00:13:34,That's what I'm doing.
00:13:34,00:13:36,It's working like a charm.
00:13:36,00:13:39,"Well, so the fact that Ann loves is that in 2008,"
00:13:39,00:13:42,there was an MI6 officer on the one show whose fake moustache fell off
00:13:42,00:13:46,"halfway through an interview, which is absolutely cracking."
00:13:46,00:13:48,You can't see the footage.
00:13:48,00:13:50,It was because they didn't actually broadcast it.
00:13:50,00:13:52,Only the people in the studio know.
00:13:52,00:13:56,"But John Amendez, who was the CIA's mass dress of disguise"
00:13:56,00:14:02,"during the George Bush era, the George Bush senior era, sorry,"
00:14:02,00:14:05,she says that you shouldn't go for fake moustaches
00:14:05,00:14:07,because they are very uncomfortable.
00:14:07,00:14:09,So it's always obvious when someone's got one.
00:14:09,00:14:12,"And the glue does tend to melt and it falls off,"
00:14:12,00:14:14,which gives the game away.
00:14:14,00:14:17,"She said, instead, horn-rimmed glasses, very effective,"
00:14:17,00:14:20,"because you notice the glasses and not the person,"
00:14:20,00:14:22,and just accessorize.
00:14:22,00:14:25,"So just carry a nice leather bag and a big cigar,"
00:14:25,00:14:27,and people will remember those two things.
00:14:27,00:14:31,Is it possible that Elton John has been deep cover CIA over the years?
00:14:31,00:14:36,[music]
00:14:36,00:14:41,"OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact."
00:14:41,00:14:44,My fact this week is that one of the most successful club songs
00:14:44,00:14:50,of all time is mostly used to stop people from wanting to dance.
00:14:50,00:14:56,"I got to say, I think that pretty much all club songs make me not want to dance."
00:14:56,00:14:59,Agreed. I just want audiobooks. That would be great.
00:14:59,00:15:01,Two AM audiobooks.
00:15:01,00:15:05,"So this is, we'll all know the song, ""Robert Miles' Children."""
00:15:05,00:15:08,You know that? [sings]
00:15:08,00:15:11,So that was a song that was written by Robert Miles.
00:15:11,00:15:13,He wrote it in Italy. He was writing under another name.
00:15:13,00:15:16,"He came Robert Miles because he wanted to go Miles in his career,"
00:15:16,00:15:19,so he had a real destiny thing to his name because he wanted to go far.
00:15:19,00:15:21,"They do kilometers, don't they?"
00:15:21,00:15:23,Yeah.
00:15:23,00:15:25,A mile is even longer.
00:15:25,00:15:32,"Yeah, and so he wrote this song, and he wanted the song to be played"
00:15:32,00:15:35,"at the end of every single club night, every rave that was happening,"
00:15:35,00:15:39,because a lot of car crashes were happening after raves.
00:15:39,00:15:42,"And it was because everyone was leaving the club of a really pumping song,"
00:15:42,00:15:45,"really adrenaline-ized, they'd get in the car and they would crash."
00:15:45,00:15:48,"The idea was play this song at the end of the set,"
00:15:48,00:15:51,"and it would put a trance-like music, it would calm the person down,"
00:15:51,00:15:53,and allow them to get into their car a bit safer.
00:15:53,00:15:55,And DJs globally have been doing it.
00:15:55,00:15:57,"It's obviously not going to be every rave that does that,"
00:15:57,00:16:00,but largely that's what that song became.
00:16:00,00:16:02,"It was Road Safety, basically, for the end of a night."
00:16:02,00:16:05,"I didn't think I knew that song, and then as soon as I listened to it,"
00:16:05,00:16:07,"I thought, ""Oh, of course, I've heard this dozens of times."""
00:16:07,00:16:09,"It was absolutely massive, wasn't it?"
00:16:09,00:16:12,"It apparently cost just £150 to produce it,"
00:16:12,00:16:16,"and it got to number one in Europe, the whole of Europe, for 13 weeks,"
00:16:16,00:16:20,and he was the only Italian solo artist to ever win a Brit award.
00:16:20,00:16:22,Really? Wow.
00:16:22,00:16:24,"Absolutely huge, and he died very young."
00:16:24,00:16:27,"He did, 47, very sadly. It's a shame."
00:16:27,00:16:29,"This thing was called the Saturday Night Slaughter,"
00:16:29,00:16:32,"or in Italian, Stradgidel Sabato Sera."
00:16:32,00:16:34,It was a recognized thing.
00:16:34,00:16:37,It was hundreds of young Italian people were dying every year.
00:16:37,00:16:40,"I think they might have assessed how much effect it's had,"
00:16:40,00:16:43,"because I've heard this song at the end of things like, you know,"
00:16:43,00:16:46,"Roller Disco, but I don't think that was..."
00:16:46,00:16:49,Is that the closest you've been to a nightclub?
00:16:49,00:16:51,"Yeah, I think it might..."
00:16:51,00:16:54,"Well, it's pretty exciting in there, Anna, so..."
00:16:54,00:16:57,"Oh, you're still on wheels, so it makes sense, right?"
00:16:57,00:16:59,"Like, that's a good use."
00:16:59,00:17:02,"But I didn't think I liked dance music, and it turns out I do."
00:17:02,00:17:04,Have you ever been to a rave?
00:17:04,00:17:06,No.
00:17:06,00:17:09,"I mean, some of that Roller Disco got pretty heavy, but..."
00:17:09,00:17:14,I feel like you would have been cheering on the Public Order Act of 1994
00:17:14,00:17:17,that kind of stopped all the raves from happening in the 90s.
00:17:17,00:17:20,"Yeah, I've got that printed out on my wall."
00:17:20,00:17:25,That law changed the number of people you needed at a rave from 100 to 20.
00:17:25,00:17:29,"So if you had 20 people in an area and they were all dancing to music,"
00:17:29,00:17:31,then you could nick them all.
00:17:31,00:17:35,"And you could ban anyone who was playing music,"
00:17:35,00:17:40,which was predominantly characterized by the omission of a succession of repetitive beats.
00:17:40,00:17:42,Right.
00:17:42,00:17:47,"And they issued a track called Flutter,"
00:17:47,00:17:51,"and in that track, no two bars had the same beat."
00:17:51,00:17:53,So it was awful.
00:17:53,00:17:55,"Well, I know, it sounds awful."
00:17:55,00:17:58,It was awful. It was really awful.
00:17:58,00:18:01,But it did the job of that you were allowed to play it in a rave
00:18:01,00:18:03,because it didn't have repetitive beats in it.
00:18:03,00:18:05,"But no one's dancing to it, presumably."
00:18:05,00:18:08,"Everyone leaves the rave, so it sounds like it would do the job of..."
00:18:08,00:18:10,The profits for it went to Liberty.
00:18:10,00:18:13,It is crazy that they tried to ban repetitive music.
00:18:13,00:18:16,"But the police were really worried. It was in the early '90s, wasn't it?"
00:18:16,00:18:21,"So this law was 1994, and that followed a couple of years of national panic,"
00:18:21,00:18:23,sort of moral panic about raves and rave music.
00:18:23,00:18:27,"There was a thing called the rave at Castle Walton Common in 1992,"
00:18:27,00:18:29,"where people danced for five days,"
00:18:29,00:18:32,"and it was a free, illegal festival basically for about 20,000 people."
00:18:32,00:18:36,And the police were just so worried about it.
00:18:36,00:18:39,"The same year, they broke up a party by using a JCB digger"
00:18:39,00:18:42,to smash through one of the walls of the party.
00:18:42,00:18:45,"I know, it was a very, very intense time."
00:18:45,00:18:48,"That sounds more dangerous than the dancing itself, doesn't it?"
00:18:48,00:18:51,"Especially for people like Andy, who's just standing next to the wall,"
00:18:51,00:18:53,not wanting to dance.
00:18:53,00:18:56,"I just can't roll a scale. That's the problem, you know."
00:18:56,00:19:01,"But actually, at that time, the rave culture was known as the second summer of love,"
00:19:01,00:19:04,but it was credited for reducing football hooliganism.
00:19:04,00:19:06,There were a lot of people who were going to football matches
00:19:06,00:19:08,and who might have caused a fight otherwise.
00:19:08,00:19:12,"Instead of taking lots of cocaine, they were taking lots of ecstasy"
00:19:12,00:19:14,and just hugging each other.
00:19:14,00:19:16,"Oh, much better, yeah."
00:19:16,00:19:18,So that's an interesting thing.
00:19:18,00:19:21,I went to a rave four nights ago.
00:19:21,00:19:22,"No, you did."
00:19:22,00:19:24,"Yes, I did. It was a birthday party in Margate."
00:19:24,00:19:28,"I got a lot of trouble from my friends there, because I brought a book with me."
00:19:28,00:19:34,And I do think like 2 a.m. dance floor book club would be an amazing thing to set up.
00:19:34,00:19:37,So I went the other night and I remembered what it was like to go to a rave.
00:19:37,00:19:41,"It was really fun, but one thing I didn't see there, which apparently happens a lot in raves,"
00:19:41,00:19:45,"is a lot of people are sucking on pacifiers, on dummies."
00:19:45,00:19:48,"And I'd never heard of that, but apparently this is a big thing."
00:19:48,00:19:51,"And the reason is it's because if you're at a rave, you're often on drugs,"
00:19:51,00:19:55,"MDMA, a big one, leads to a massive amount of grinding of teeth."
00:19:55,00:20:00,People used to do that in my world of days.
00:20:00,00:20:02,Here we go. All right.
00:20:02,00:20:04,And I'm not going to go into any further detail.
00:20:04,00:20:07,"Okay, so pacifiers, dance music."
00:20:07,00:20:12,Do you want to play a game of type of electronic music or show on CBBs?
00:20:12,00:20:15,Yes.
00:20:15,00:20:16,Okay.
00:20:16,00:20:18,"Okay, so Fidget House."
00:20:18,00:20:22,Is that a show on CBBs or is it type of electronic music?
00:20:22,00:20:24,I'll say that's CBBs.
00:20:24,00:20:25,"Yeah, CBBs."
00:20:25,00:20:28,"Okay, I'll go just for the sake of Variety House."
00:20:28,00:20:30,"You are correct, Dan."
00:20:30,00:20:33,"It is defined by snatched vocal snippets,"
00:20:33,00:20:35,"pitch bent dirty bass lines,"
00:20:35,00:20:39,and rave style synth stabs over glitchy 4/4 beats.
00:20:39,00:20:40,Wow.
00:20:40,00:20:43,And I might as well have said anything on that stage.
00:20:43,00:20:45,What about Puffin Rock?
00:20:45,00:20:47,"Oh, God."
00:20:47,00:20:51,"Yeah, clearly house music, dance music."
00:20:51,00:20:52,Audience Puffin Rock.
00:20:52,00:20:54,CBBs.
00:20:54,00:20:57,"We have a very young audience in today, we should say."
00:20:57,00:21:00,They're all sucking on pacifiers on the front row.
00:21:00,00:21:04,"Yeah, it's an animated children's series about a young Puffin named Una."
00:21:04,00:21:05,Okay.
00:21:05,00:21:08,Are there any glitchy 4/4 beats?
00:21:08,00:21:10,Baby Club.
00:21:10,00:21:12,Baby Club.
00:21:12,00:21:16,Is it Baby Club or is it Baby Club Music?
00:21:16,00:21:18,I think it's Baby Club Music.
00:21:18,00:21:19,"Yeah, Music."
00:21:19,00:21:21,You are so bad at this.
00:21:21,00:21:24,"And also, don't you have very young kids?"
00:21:24,00:21:29,I haven't actually locked in my answer yet.
00:21:29,00:21:31,I feel like I might have given away.
00:21:31,00:21:32,"Go up, Dan."
00:21:32,00:21:33,Club.
00:21:33,00:21:35,"No, CBBs, obviously."
00:21:35,00:21:36,"Yeah, I know."
00:21:36,00:21:38,It's where all the kids sit round in a circle and sing songs.
00:21:38,00:21:39,"Oh, beautiful."
00:21:39,00:21:44,"And finally, Squee, S-K-W-E-E-E."
00:21:44,00:21:45,Club.
00:21:45,00:21:46,Baby.
00:21:46,00:21:47,Club.
00:21:47,00:21:48,It is a type of music.
00:21:48,00:21:49,Yes.
00:21:49,00:21:54,It's a type of music where the aim is to squeeze out as much interesting sounds as possible.
00:21:54,00:21:57,From where?
00:21:57,00:22:00,"From the synthesizers, Dan."
00:22:00,00:22:01,"Ah, okay."
00:22:01,00:22:05,One of the things I find quite interesting is that the subgenres of dance are basically
00:22:05,00:22:07,"just defined by their tempo, right?"
00:22:07,00:22:10,"So, trance was just it going slower."
00:22:10,00:22:15,"And so, the oldest trance band is a thousand years old."
00:22:15,00:22:17,And they're so cool.
00:22:17,00:22:19,They're called the Master Musicians.
00:22:19,00:22:20,Is this like collectively?
00:22:20,00:22:23,Like how the Rolling Stones are about 400 now?
00:22:23,00:22:24,"No, no, no."
00:22:24,00:22:25,It's been going for a thousand years.
00:22:25,00:22:26,Okay.
00:22:26,00:22:28,They're all still in fitters fiddles.
00:22:28,00:22:29,There's been some handover.
00:22:29,00:22:31,"So, it started a thousand years ago."
00:22:31,00:22:33,It's based in Sufi tradition.
00:22:33,00:22:35,And it's in Morocco.
00:22:35,00:22:39,"They opened Glastonbury in 2023, which I think just means you play Glastonbury when no one's"
00:22:39,00:22:41,quite arrived yet.
00:22:41,00:22:43,"But still, and they're incredible."
00:22:43,00:22:44,You should look them up.
00:22:44,00:22:46,And they're better than anything you see at a club.
00:22:46,00:22:49,"So, performances in their, like, if they do a performance,"
00:22:49,00:22:51,it goes on all night or it can go on for days.
00:22:51,00:22:53,They play constantly.
00:22:53,00:22:55,It's supposed to induce a literal trance.
00:22:55,00:23:00,And it's on drums and would win mostly lots of circular breathing.
00:23:00,00:23:06,And then it climaxes in this pan-like god who comes and dances around flames and quivers
00:23:06,00:23:09,and chases children around with olive branches.
00:23:09,00:23:14,And he's dressed in the skins of four black goats.
00:23:14,00:23:17,And he's been played by the same guy for the last 50 years.
00:23:17,00:23:18,"Anyway, you can go."
00:23:18,00:23:19,It's the festival in Morocco.
00:23:19,00:23:20,You can go and see them perform.
00:23:20,00:23:22,It's the smallest festival in the world.
00:23:22,00:23:24,Only 50 people can attend.
00:23:24,00:23:27,Have a tent or want to attend.
00:23:27,00:23:29,"Yeah, they've never actually set a limit."
00:23:29,00:23:30,It sounds great.
00:23:30,00:23:32,You stay in the musicians' houses.
00:23:32,00:23:33,They have to cook for you.
00:23:33,00:23:34,That sounds good.
00:23:34,00:23:37,"Yeah, they cook all your meals and then they go and perform."
00:23:37,00:23:38,It's a big deal.
00:23:38,00:23:40,Timothy Leary was very into it.
00:23:40,00:23:41,Was he?
00:23:41,00:23:42,"Yeah, William Burroughs."
00:23:42,00:23:43,All your guys.
00:23:43,00:23:46,"Yeah, so we're talking counterculture, 1950s kind of period."
00:23:46,00:23:47,That kind of thing.
00:23:47,00:23:48,Yeah.
00:23:48,00:23:50,"The guy who's chasing the children, is he trying to beat them?"
00:23:50,00:23:54,"Because normally if you say, ""I want to offer you an olive branch,"" it's a nice thing."
00:23:54,00:23:55,"No, no, it's scary."
00:23:55,00:23:56,It's scary.
00:23:56,00:23:57,"Yeah, he's going for a beating."
00:23:57,00:24:01,But I'm sure it's mostly just acted out at this point unless they've been really naughty.
00:24:01,00:24:05,"It's interesting you mentioned beats because I was talking to, so my best friend is Ash Gardner."
00:24:05,00:24:08,He wrote the theme tune to know such thing as a fish.
00:24:08,00:24:09,"So ""Empra, Yes."""
00:24:09,00:24:10,"It's the song called ""Wasps."""
00:24:10,00:24:17,"After he released that album, they were approached by Superdrug because Superdrug wanted to make"
00:24:17,00:24:21,the ultimate electronic song to make love to.
00:24:21,00:24:23,"Wait, Superdrug the chemist?"
00:24:23,00:24:24,"Yeah, yeah."
00:24:24,00:24:28,"And yeah, when I did that in Superdrug, I got kicked out."
00:24:28,00:24:35,"Yeah, they approached Ash and said, ""We want to commission you to write a song that couples can make love to."""
00:24:35,00:24:37,Was it to sell condoms?
00:24:37,00:24:39,It was about to lose weight.
00:24:39,00:24:44,It was about being healthy while you're in bed.
00:24:44,00:24:46,So this is how they described it.
00:24:46,00:24:47,What was he talking about?
00:24:47,00:24:48,This is Ash.
00:24:48,00:24:50,How has this ever come up?
00:24:50,00:24:55,"He wrote our theme tune and then he wrote ""Sexercise,"" which is the song."
00:24:55,00:24:56,This is the description.
00:24:56,00:25:03,"""As written by Superdrug for the release, 'Sexercise' is something of a sonic epic at 22 minutes long."
00:25:03,00:25:09,"This is a melting pot of ideas and experimentation, a synth-laden exploration of pure passion."""
00:25:09,00:25:13,"And there's a few comments underneath that one guy was like, ""Doesn't do it for me, dog."""
00:25:13,00:25:15,And it's pretty weird.
00:25:15,00:25:18,But they got paid really well for it.
00:25:18,00:25:24,What they were told was there's the BPM that is best for being in bed doing the act.
00:25:24,00:25:28,"And that's why the obesity epidemic ended, wasn't it, when everyone started shagging?"
00:25:28,00:25:32,"He said years ago that sex only burns off the number of calories in, what was it?"
00:25:32,00:25:36,It was one small meringue without sugar.
00:25:36,00:25:37,It was one small sugar-free meringue.
00:25:37,00:25:40,I think there are ways of having sex where you can gain calories.
00:25:40,00:25:43,"I don't really spend time how you do it, doesn't it?"
00:25:43,00:25:56,It is time for fact number three.
00:25:56,00:25:59,And that is James.
00:25:59,00:26:06,My fact this week is that children could learn to read faster if all lessons were held in a podcast studio.
00:26:06,00:26:10,This is a study that was done in Japan.
00:26:10,00:26:15,And the idea was they got a couple of classrooms and one of them that they really soundproofed
00:26:15,00:26:18,and the other one was just a normal classroom.
00:26:18,00:26:21,"And they found that the children did much, much better in the soundproofed room."
00:26:21,00:26:27,"The idea is that when you're trying to learn how to read or learn how to speak, you're listening to your teacher"
00:26:27,00:26:30,and you're trying to work out what they're saying.
00:26:30,00:26:33,"But when there's loads of echoing around, you can't really hear it all properly."
00:26:33,00:26:37,"And also with very, very young kids, you might get one of the kids gets a bit upset"
00:26:37,00:26:41,and they start making noise and then the teacher has to go louder and then the kids go louder
00:26:41,00:26:45,and you get all this feedback of just things getting louder and louder and much more difficult to understand what's going on.
00:26:45,00:26:49,And so they tried this and they found that actually children did much better
00:26:49,00:26:51,and even the teachers found it much easier as well.
00:26:51,00:26:55,The teachers found their job just way easier because they weren't having to fight against the echo.
00:26:55,00:26:57,"So interesting. Yeah, really good."
00:26:57,00:27:01,"So when you say soundproof, you mean putting soft furnishings and mattresses everywhere."
00:27:01,00:27:05,"Yeah, so, I mean, how many people in the audience here today?"
00:27:05,00:27:09,"1,500 people or whatever? Probably most of you have a podcast, I think."
00:27:09,00:27:13,"But when you're doing a podcast, you have to try and make it the room as unequally as possible."
00:27:13,00:27:15,So you've closed your curtains.
00:27:15,00:27:16,Velour cushions.
00:27:16,00:27:17,All that kind of stuff.
00:27:17,00:27:21,I thought you guys were doing that to try and seduce me. All these years.
00:27:21,00:27:23,"Oh, it's very cool, the sound quality thing."
00:27:23,00:27:29,"Because there was a study done this year, I think, about, I mean, obviously everyone uses Zoom now."
00:27:29,00:27:35,"And if you use Zoom with a bad or a cheap microphone, it turns out people literally think you are stupider."
00:27:35,00:27:43,"You could be the cleverest person in the Zoom, but if you don't have a good microphone, others genuinely downgrade you."
00:27:43,00:27:45,How interesting.
00:27:45,00:27:47,"And it's, you know, and it can, it applies to sort of everything."
00:27:47,00:27:53,"So it's, you're less clever if you've got a bad microphone or you're thought to be, or less hireable if it's a job interview, less datable."
00:27:53,00:27:55,If you're doing school Zoom dating.
00:27:55,00:27:57,And it's just microphone quality.
00:27:57,00:27:58,Really? Yeah.
00:27:58,00:28:02,"Again, we should emphasize just on Zoom, don't go to live interviews with your own microphone or anything."
00:28:02,00:28:04,"We're not recommending that, are we?"
00:28:04,00:28:08,But we wouldn't want the kids to learn in these studios because it would put podcasters out of business.
00:28:08,00:28:13,"And podcasting is a great industry, Cross2Wire's Festival, I think we agree."
00:28:13,00:28:17,"Named, kind of named accidentally."
00:28:17,00:28:20,I mostly say because Andy likes an accidental invention.
00:28:20,00:28:21,Oh yeah.
00:28:21,00:28:24,So named in 2004 and named after iPods.
00:28:24,00:28:30,"There was a software engineer, Dave Weiner, who started the first podcast for a journalist called Christopher Lydden."
00:28:30,00:28:37,"And he created a program called iPodder, which was called that because it was made to deliver online broadcasts straight to iPods."
00:28:37,00:28:44,"And then a guy called Ben Hammersley wrote a piece in The Guardian about this new audio medium, which was to be called podcast."
00:28:44,00:28:49,"And he went to his editors and they said, ""It's great. Just need a bit of padding. Can you shove it in a relevant sentence somewhere?"""
00:28:49,00:28:58,"So he said at the top, he wrote kind of a facile sentence saying, ""Oh, what to call this? Audio blogging, podcasting, guerrilla media?"""
00:28:58,00:29:01,And they caught on from there. Just a stupid bit of filler.
00:29:01,00:29:12,"What's interesting is September 28th, 2004, there was a blogger called Doc Searls, and he went to track the number of hits that Google would return if he wrote podcast into there."
00:29:12,00:29:17,"The first time he says 24 times, reportedly. And then it starts to get bigger."
00:29:17,00:29:22,"By the end of September, there are 2,750 hits on Google coming back for podcast."
00:29:22,00:29:28,"An exact year later, the 28th of September, 2005, over 100 million."
00:29:28,00:29:31,And you know who was really pissed off about it? Microsoft.
00:29:31,00:29:38,"Because obviously you've got the pod from iPod, so every time someone said podcasting, it was basically an advert for Apple."
00:29:38,00:29:45,"And so Microsoft tried to use their own name. They all called them blockcasts until everyone in the world went, ""No, we're not calling them that."""
00:29:45,00:29:51,"That's not a good name. You know, a quarter of podcasts have one episode."
00:29:51,00:29:52,"Oh, really?"
00:29:52,00:29:54,And I think it's 65% and have fewer than 10.
00:29:54,00:29:58,"A lot of people say it should be higher, those proportions."
00:29:58,00:30:03,"I read an article by a company called Buzzsprout, who's a free podcast host."
00:30:03,00:30:10,"And they said, ""If your new episode gets within seven days, 28 downloads, you're in the top 50% of podcasts."""
00:30:10,00:30:11,Wow.
00:30:11,00:30:12,So we can get that one day.
00:30:12,00:30:13,Yes.
00:30:13,00:30:14,We can dream.
00:30:14,00:30:17,George Bush was a forerunner in the World Podcasting.
00:30:17,00:30:18,George Bush.
00:30:18,00:30:19,George Bush.
00:30:19,00:30:21,"George Bush is senior weirdly, yeah."
00:30:21,00:30:24,Very rare to have a double Bush podcast. Nice.
00:30:24,00:30:28,Double Bush and a beaver.
00:30:28,00:30:37,"This was George Bush the younger, and he released his presidential weekly address as a podcast in the kind of latest 2000, I think 2008-ish, which was pretty impressive."
00:30:37,00:30:41,"And he used to sometimes deliver it in Spanish, which is like good on him."
00:30:41,00:30:47,"But then I watched a little interview with one of his Hispanic colleagues who remembered that journalists would come up to him all the time and say,"
00:30:47,00:30:51,"""Isn't it great that your colleague, the president, George Bush, speaks Spanish as well?"""
00:30:51,00:30:55,"And he said he never wanted to say to them, ""He doesn't speak Spanish."""
00:30:55,00:30:57,He wasn't just making it up.
00:30:57,00:31:02,"He does try to speak Spanish, he said, and that's good enough."
00:31:02,00:31:08,There's quite a few podcasts out there when you look into the history of it that arguably are the first podcast.
00:31:08,00:31:14,"I tried to look into it, accidentally found out the oldest podcaster in theory, as in current age."
00:31:14,00:31:17,And there's a guy. There was an article that went out this year.
00:31:17,00:31:20,"He's 100 years old, and he has started making a podcast."
00:31:20,00:31:26,"He's called George Hall, and he was Lawrence Olivier's voice coach."
00:31:26,00:31:28,So cool.
00:31:28,00:31:36,"Yeah, so he's basically dishing interesting anecdotes about Lord Olivier, his wife, people that he knew."
00:31:36,00:31:44,"Apparently, in one of the interviews, he says that Olivier was going through a phase of being absolutely obsessed about colonic irrigation."
00:31:44,00:31:49,This is the kind of juice we're getting from George Hall at this point.
00:31:49,00:31:52,We should mention the elephant in the room in the podcasting world.
00:31:52,00:31:55,"Joe Rogan, have you heard of it? Big deal."
00:31:55,00:32:00,"If you listen to Joe Rogan, which someone in the audience just said, ""Nope."""
00:32:00,00:32:07,"Well, lots of people do, but if you do listen to it, American women will be less interested in you as a partner."
00:32:07,00:32:11,And this was a survey that was done.
00:32:11,00:32:18,It's another beard and moustache situation. Everyone thinks it makes the moral traction.
00:32:18,00:32:20,"Is it for men or is it for, yeah?"
00:32:20,00:32:23,American women between 18 and 34 were surveyed about what was a turn-off for them.
00:32:23,00:32:27,So 55% said definite turn-off in a partner if they listened to Joe Rogan.
00:32:27,00:32:31,"I just thought some of the other turn-offs were quite interesting about where we are, like societally."
00:32:31,00:32:35,They send green texts. That's a red flag for 7% of women.
00:32:35,00:32:37,What is that about recycling?
00:32:37,00:32:41,I think it's not having an iPhone. I think it's sort of that.
00:32:41,00:32:44,Instead of the blue ones if you're on an iPhone.
00:32:44,00:32:46,Then there were some very weird red flags.
00:32:46,00:32:49,"""Researching for best deals and rates before buying."""
00:32:49,00:32:53,"2% of American women said, ""No, that's not for me."""
00:32:53,00:32:57,"They read. 1% said, ""Red flag."""
00:32:57,00:33:01,"They look better in person. 1% said, ""Red flag."""
00:33:01,00:33:03,Interesting.
00:33:03,00:33:07,"Whereas when men, American men of the same age were asked about women,"
00:33:07,00:33:12,for them the biggest red flag they identify as a communist. 64% red flag.
00:33:12,00:33:16,"You've got to keep those red flags fired, haven't you?"
00:33:16,00:33:24,"I think it's hard, the earliest podcast, because basically before podcasts you had distributing cassette tapes around the place."
00:33:24,00:33:27,"I feel like that was the original podcast, was bootleg cassette tapes."
00:33:27,00:33:33,"Because the thing about podcasting is that you're free of all the constraints of having to produce a show which has all this oversight, right?"
00:33:33,00:33:38,"That's why there's so much shit out there, it's because there's kind of no standards imposed."
00:33:38,00:33:44,"Again, we want to say that podcasting is a great industry and that this festival does really good jobs."
00:33:44,00:33:46,"Of course, yes, all of that stuff."
00:33:46,00:33:51,"But Russia did a strong line in that, I hadn't realised during the Cold War."
00:33:51,00:33:58,"So there was Samizdat in Russia, which was the quite famous distribution of the written word."
00:33:58,00:34:03,"It was banned stuff, exactly, like soldier needs in or banned authors."
00:34:03,00:34:08,You'd type things out endlessly and then you'd send them to your friends and they'd retype them and send them to their friends.
00:34:08,00:34:13,"And then there was this thing called Magnitizdat, which was publishing by tape recorder."
00:34:13,00:34:18,"And I think this is the original podcasting where basically you record yourself into a tape saying,"
00:34:18,00:34:22,"""I'm not a huge Russian fan or something, don't like Stalin."""
00:34:22,00:34:24,"And then you'd send it to your mates and you'd say,"
00:34:24,00:34:27,"""Can you listen to this and then make a copy of it and send it to your friends?"""
00:34:27,00:34:34,"And for some of these broadcasts, millions of people would end up hearing, apparently, which seems incredible."
00:34:34,00:34:36,Patrons saying to podcasting?
00:34:36,00:34:37,We have one?
00:34:37,00:34:38,We do.
00:34:38,00:34:39,"Well, it's unofficial."
00:34:39,00:34:42,It was organised by some trainee priests in Birmingham.
00:34:42,00:34:44,[laughter]
00:34:44,00:34:50,But they named Saint George Pricker as the unofficial patron saint of podcasting
00:34:50,00:34:54,because he worked sort of spreading the values of the gospel
00:34:54,00:34:58,and he would send out lots of books and prayer booklets
00:34:58,00:35:01,and he did lots of talking to people and that kind of thing.
00:35:01,00:35:02,So he's a real saint?
00:35:02,00:35:03,He's a real person.
00:35:03,00:35:04,He's a real person.
00:35:04,00:35:11,His miracle that made him a saint was that he saw a 12-year-old boy pushing a cart full of manure
00:35:11,00:35:15,"and then when he went to help him, he put his hand on the cart"
00:35:15,00:35:19,and felt an extraordinary spiritual sweetness from the manure.
00:35:19,00:35:20,Wow.
00:35:20,00:35:21,"Also, what?"
00:35:21,00:35:26,"I don't know why pushing shit around makes you a patron saint of podcasting, but..."
00:35:26,00:35:31,"Well, also, he did a miraculous thing where he was able to get you 20% off your express VPN"
00:35:31,00:35:33,whenever you put in an offer code.
00:35:33,00:35:35,Do you know there is a thing now?
00:35:35,00:35:39,This is a practice that's going on where people are setting up entire podcasts
00:35:39,00:35:41,so that they can secure business meetings.
00:35:41,00:35:45,So if you want to get in touch with someone in your industry who you admire
00:35:45,00:35:49,"and you might write to them on LinkedIn, you might send them a cold email"
00:35:49,00:35:50,and you might never hear from them.
00:35:50,00:35:53,"But if you write to them and say, ""Would you like to appear on my podcast?"""
00:35:53,00:35:55,"there's a much bigger chance they'll say, ""Oh yeah, I'd love to."""
00:35:55,00:35:56,Wow.
00:35:56,00:35:59,So people are just setting up entire podcasts which have like four listeners
00:35:59,00:36:02,simply because it's a prestigious thing to be asked to do.
00:36:02,00:36:03,Yeah.
00:36:03,00:36:04,I thought that was why we were doing it.
00:36:04,00:36:06,I can't even remember who we were trying to meet.
00:36:08,00:36:11,"Hey guys, I need to move us on to our next fact."
00:36:11,00:36:13,Can I tell you one last good podcast name?
00:36:13,00:36:14,Yeah.
00:36:14,00:36:17,There's a podcast all about the horses in Lord of the Rings.
00:36:17,00:36:19,Each episode is up to three hours long.
00:36:19,00:36:21,I just love the name.
00:36:21,00:36:22,Horses in Lord of the Rings.
00:36:22,00:36:25,The title of the podcast is Shadow Facts.
00:36:25,00:36:28,That is good.
00:36:28,00:36:29,Lovely.
00:36:35,00:36:40,"All right, we need to get to our final fact of the show and that is Anna."
00:36:40,00:36:46,My fact this week is that Second World War bombings were useful for freeing up parking spaces.
00:36:46,00:36:52,"So every cloud, I think you'll find."
00:36:52,00:36:58,"This, yeah, it's hard to get the quantity, but basically in Second World War,"
00:36:58,00:37:01,you may or may not know there was quite a lot of aerial bombing campaigns.
00:37:01,00:37:04,The Blitz being a famous example.
00:37:04,00:37:09,And what that did was flatten a lot of buildings and leave an enormous amount of space in the middle of cities
00:37:09,00:37:15,"where, well, for example, the big car parking franchise, NCP Car Parks in the UK,"
00:37:15,00:37:19,they founded their first car park on a bomb site in Red Lion Square in Hoban.
00:37:19,00:37:22,That was in 1948 and lots more followed.
00:37:22,00:37:27,"And if you watch kind of bulletins at the time, there was kind of a panic in the 1950s"
00:37:27,00:37:31,because car ownership was going up and up that there wouldn't be any parking spaces left.
00:37:31,00:37:37,"But I was watching a bulletin saying, fortunately, at the moment, we've got so many massive bomb sites"
00:37:37,00:37:42,with no buildings on them that we have managed to find space to park all the cars until now.
00:37:42,00:37:47,"But if we don't have another bombing campaign soon, we'll have nowhere to put the cars."
00:37:47,00:37:50,"They didn't say that, but it was implied."
00:37:50,00:37:54,It's incredible the story of that first car park.
00:37:54,00:37:58,"Okay, this is really fun, I promise."
00:37:58,00:38:01,"And if you doubt it halfway through, just remember, it is really, really fun."
00:38:01,00:38:04,"Okay, that one in Red Lion Square in Hoban."
00:38:04,00:38:08,"So, 1948, founded by two guys called Donald Gosling and Ronald Hobson,"
00:38:08,00:38:11,"and they were told, this will never work."
00:38:11,00:38:14,"That's a stupid idea. You can park on the side of the road anytime,"
00:38:14,00:38:19,and no one's going to pay one shilling and sixpence for an entire day's parking in central London.
00:38:19,00:38:21,"They were just told, don't do it."
00:38:21,00:38:24,"I'm just sorry to cut you off, but how many cars did we have at the time?"
00:38:24,00:38:25,Was it a problem parking?
00:38:25,00:38:27,"They did it now, right? They're very useful."
00:38:27,00:38:29,You could just park on the side of the street in most places.
00:38:29,00:38:30,"So, we didn't really need it."
00:38:30,00:38:31,You could park on Oxford Street.
00:38:31,00:38:33,But they were going up very fast.
00:38:33,00:38:35,Post-war car ownership was going up.
00:38:35,00:38:37,"Anyway, this is going to get fun, is it?"
00:38:37,00:38:41,"Well, I'm now slightly doubting that."
00:38:41,00:38:43,"Anyway, they bought it for 200 quid, 100 quid each they put in."
00:38:43,00:38:45,They bought this space for a car park.
00:38:45,00:38:48,They sold the business 50 years later in 1998.
00:38:48,00:38:51,Each of them got 300 million pounds from the sale.
00:38:51,00:38:52,Wow!
00:38:52,00:38:54,There was more than one car park by that point.
00:38:54,00:38:56,"That's a good effect, yeah."
00:38:56,00:38:59,The whole business was sold for 800 million pounds.
00:38:59,00:39:00,Wow!
00:39:00,00:39:01,They nearly didn't sell the business.
00:39:01,00:39:03,"It nearly fell over at the very last moment,"
00:39:03,00:39:06,"because Ronald Hobson, one of the two co-founders,"
00:39:06,00:39:10,he wanted one particular car park to be excluded from the sale
00:39:10,00:39:12,because it was on Oxford Street
00:39:12,00:39:14,and he wanted it to be excluded from the sale
00:39:14,00:39:16,because he would go there at the weekend
00:39:16,00:39:18,and park up with a flask of tea
00:39:18,00:39:21,and study which parking bays were occupied first.
00:39:21,00:39:22,Wow!
00:39:22,00:39:24,So he wanted that to be like...
00:39:24,00:39:25,That is fascinating.
00:39:25,00:39:26,I know.
00:39:26,00:39:27,Do we know the results?
00:39:27,00:39:29,"Okay, okay, okay."
00:39:29,00:39:30,Sorry.
00:39:30,00:39:32,"I'm sorry for finding it so interesting, but..."
00:39:32,00:39:34,I don't know if you think who parks where first.
00:39:34,00:39:35,Is it under the tree?
00:39:35,00:39:37,Is it closest to the parking meter?
00:39:37,00:39:39,I couldn't agree more on it.
00:39:39,00:39:40,"This is an interesting fact,"
00:39:40,00:39:42,but I feel like I've lost the room at this point.
00:39:42,00:39:43,Oh my God.
00:39:43,00:39:44,I think we're locked in.
00:39:44,00:39:45,"That is an interesting thing, right?"
00:39:45,00:39:47,"So if you go into a car parking place,"
00:39:47,00:39:50,do you just park as soon as you go in
00:39:50,00:39:52,where there's loads of spaces?
00:39:52,00:39:54,Or do you drive as close to the door as possible
00:39:54,00:39:56,and then drive around looking for the perfect spot?
00:39:56,00:39:57,I do that.
00:39:57,00:39:59,"Yeah, so does almost everyone."
00:39:59,00:40:01,"It turns out that actually, on average,"
00:40:01,00:40:03,it kind of works out about even.
00:40:03,00:40:04,Okay.
00:40:04,00:40:06,But people have found that actually a lot of traffic
00:40:06,00:40:09,in towns consists of people looking for spaces.
00:40:09,00:40:12,And they did a study in the German city of Freiburg
00:40:12,00:40:16,in the 2010s and found that 74% of cars
00:40:16,00:40:19,at one moment were looking for a parking spot.
00:40:19,00:40:21,Oh my God.
00:40:21,00:40:23,"It's mental, isn't it?"
00:40:23,00:40:24,"Yeah, it's bad."
00:40:24,00:40:26,A lot of pollution there.
00:40:26,00:40:28,"People cruising, it's called,"
00:40:28,00:40:30,which is much less sexy version of cruising
00:40:30,00:40:32,than other versions of cruising.
00:40:32,00:40:35,"No, I'm cruising officer."
00:40:35,00:40:36,There are some countries in the world
00:40:36,00:40:38,with some really mad parking systems.
00:40:38,00:40:40,I don't think we've mentioned before.
00:40:40,00:40:42,"Quite a lot of countries,"
00:40:42,00:40:44,"the cold ones mostly,"
00:40:44,00:40:46,how systems where you have to park on one side of the road
00:40:46,00:40:48,or the other so that they can sweep the snow
00:40:48,00:40:50,off the non-parked-on side.
00:40:50,00:40:52,"And they have different ways of signifying this,"
00:40:52,00:40:54,but Sweden's is so good.
00:40:54,00:40:57,It's called their datum park herring system.
00:40:57,00:41:01,And it's exemplified by a post on Reddit I read
00:41:01,00:41:03,"from an American tourist saying,"
00:41:03,00:41:05,"""Sorry for the dumb question,"
00:41:05,00:41:07,but we really can't make sense of this sign.
00:41:07,00:41:09,"We're on holiday in Sweden. Can we park here?"""
00:41:09,00:41:12,The sign is a vertical white line on one side of the sign
00:41:12,00:41:15,and two vertical lines on the other side of the sign.
00:41:15,00:41:18,"The answer that a helpful Swedish resident gave was,"
00:41:18,00:41:21,it means you're not allowed to park on the side of the street
00:41:21,00:41:23,with even or odd house numbers
00:41:23,00:41:26,on correspondingly even or odd days.
00:41:26,00:41:28,[laughter]
00:41:28,00:41:30,So there you go.
00:41:30,00:41:34,"So you have to, if it's like the 11th of July,"
00:41:34,00:41:37,you have to make sure you're not parking on the side of the street
00:41:37,00:41:40,"that has houses numbers 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9."
00:41:40,00:41:42,"Simple, then you should know that"
00:41:42,00:41:45,the sign is three random lines on it.
00:41:45,00:41:47,In America they have a lot of things like this.
00:41:47,00:41:50,"Quite a lot of towns, especially Pittsburgh apparently,"
00:41:50,00:41:53,they do this thing where if you go out for the day
00:41:53,00:41:56,"and you take your car, then you'll put a chair where your car was"
00:41:56,00:41:58,so that no one can park there.
00:41:58,00:41:59,Oh yeah.
00:41:59,00:42:01,"And they're not really supposed to do it,"
00:42:01,00:42:04,"but really the local cops, they just turn a blind eye."
00:42:04,00:42:06,Like outside your house?
00:42:06,00:42:08,"Yeah, so you've gone out to the shops,"
00:42:08,00:42:10,but you don't want anyone to park right outside your house.
00:42:10,00:42:12,You've got a chair there and then no one else will park it.
00:42:12,00:42:15,And everyone kind of knows that that's the way that we do things.
00:42:15,00:42:17,"And then according to the economists,"
00:42:17,00:42:19,"in Shanghai they do the same thing,"
00:42:19,00:42:22,but people get their elderly relatives to sit in parking spaces.
00:42:22,00:42:24,No chair?
00:42:24,00:42:26,I've seen there is a chair.
00:42:26,00:42:28,There's a granny on the ground.
00:42:28,00:42:30,I was reading about UK car parks
00:42:30,00:42:35,"and I found that in 2004, Focus, the science magazine,"
00:42:35,00:42:40,they were given a brief to come up with the ten most secure places on Earth.
00:42:40,00:42:43,"And those places included Saddam's Baghdad Bunker,"
00:42:43,00:42:48,"the Mormon Church Records, Fort Knox, Air Force One,"
00:42:48,00:42:52,and a car park in Derby called Bald Lane.
00:42:52,00:42:53,Right?
00:42:53,00:42:56,And you know how I was an hour late for the podcast today?
00:42:56,00:42:57,That's where you went?
00:42:57,00:42:58,That's where I was.
00:42:58,00:42:59,Oh my God!
00:42:59,00:43:01,You went to the highest secure place in the UK basically?
00:43:01,00:43:03,"Yeah, well I was driving past it."
00:43:03,00:43:05,What is it?
00:43:05,00:43:08,It's the most secure car park in the world.
00:43:08,00:43:09,What does that mean?
00:43:09,00:43:12,There's a big sign that says this is the most secure car park in the world.
00:43:12,00:43:13,What does it mean?
00:43:13,00:43:16,"I should say it's in Derby, not Derby."
00:43:16,00:43:18,Did I say Derby?
00:43:18,00:43:19,You said Derby.
00:43:19,00:43:20,Wow.
00:43:20,00:43:21,But it's amazing.
00:43:21,00:43:23,So you go in and they give you this card
00:43:23,00:43:27,and then you park in the thing and they have sensors underneath your car.
00:43:27,00:43:30,"And when you leave, you say which bay you're in"
00:43:30,00:43:32,and then the sensor switches on.
00:43:32,00:43:35,And if anyone moves your car before you come back
00:43:35,00:43:37,then the whole place locks down.
00:43:37,00:43:38,No.
00:43:38,00:43:39,"Yeah, absolutely."
00:43:39,00:43:42,And there are 190 CCTV cameras in the building.
00:43:42,00:43:44,They have a huge PA system.
00:43:44,00:43:46,They have panic buttons all the way through.
00:43:46,00:43:48,"So anywhere you go, you could just bang the panic button."
00:43:48,00:43:50,"Again, everything shuts down."
00:43:50,00:43:51,Did you do it?
00:43:51,00:43:53,"Oh, boom!"
00:43:53,00:43:55,Why do you think I was an hour late?
00:43:55,00:43:57,"No, it's absolutely amazing."
00:43:57,00:43:59,"And what happened was, it was in 1997,"
00:43:59,00:44:01,there was a load of crime that was happening there.
00:44:01,00:44:04,There was a lot of drug taking and muggings and stuff like that.
00:44:04,00:44:06,And the council didn't really know what to do.
00:44:06,00:44:08,"And so they got this guy called Ken Wigley,"
00:44:08,00:44:11,who had invented a load of security systems
00:44:11,00:44:13,"and said, ""Do you want to take over it?"""
00:44:13,00:44:16,"And he said, ""Well, I'll take over it as long as I can do whatever I want."""
00:44:16,00:44:19,And he just basically put all these amazing systems in.
00:44:19,00:44:21,"He's like Judge Dredd, but for parking."
00:44:21,00:44:23,This is so amazing.
00:44:23,00:44:25,"So if you've parked your car there, you're busy shopping,"
00:44:25,00:44:27,"you've bumped into your partner in town, you give them the car keys,"
00:44:27,00:44:29,"you say, ""Darling, I parked the car, can you pick it up?"""
00:44:29,00:44:31,That's it. They're arrested.
00:44:31,00:44:34,"As long as they've got the car, they're okay."
00:44:34,00:44:36,"Okay, fine."
00:44:36,00:44:40,So you can walk around Derby and go to as many vape shops and bookmakers as you want.
00:44:40,00:44:41,Really?
00:44:41,00:44:43,And your car will be absolutely safe.
00:44:43,00:44:44,Wow.
00:44:44,00:44:47,I think I know one which is as secure.
00:44:47,00:44:49,"I don't think you'll have found this, Dan."
00:44:49,00:44:50,Okay.
00:44:50,00:44:54,There is a car park in Farnborough that is only accessible on foot.
00:44:57,00:44:59,That's brilliant.
00:44:59,00:45:00,This was reported...
00:45:00,00:45:02,This is for the Flintstones.
00:45:02,00:45:07,"This was reported several years ago, and I had a look on Google Images."
00:45:07,00:45:10,Certainly the most recent image shows no cars there.
00:45:10,00:45:14,"It's above the gym. The business is called the gym, I'm not just being vague."
00:45:14,00:45:17,"When it was first reported, it had absolutely everything."
00:45:17,00:45:19,"It's got bays, it's got signs, it's got all of that."
00:45:19,00:45:21,But the only thing it lacked was access for a car.
00:45:21,00:45:25,And that's because it's part of a big development which hasn't been finished yet.
00:45:25,00:45:29,"So you can go there to this day, but just not with a car."
00:45:29,00:45:30,Wow.
00:45:30,00:45:32,"That is secure in the other way, you can't get in."
00:45:32,00:45:35,I thought it was going to be a clever system where you had to lift your own car in or something.
00:45:35,00:45:39,"Like I was actually in Spain a couple of weeks ago, we went into an underground car park."
00:45:39,00:45:43,"And instead of parking your own car someone stopped us and said, ""I'll park your car for you."""
00:45:43,00:45:45,And the system is you get out of your car.
00:45:45,00:45:47,I've fallen for that so many times.
00:45:47,00:45:49,I've fallen for the number of cars I've been through.
00:45:49,00:45:52,You're on the 19th car this year.
00:45:52,00:45:54,You've given me your keys and you watch.
00:45:54,00:45:56,And they go up to a parking space.
00:45:56,00:45:59,"And the parking spaces are so narrow to save space, presumably,"
00:45:59,00:46:03,"that they then get out of the car before parking it, take the handbrake off and push it in"
00:46:03,00:46:05,so that they don't have to get out of the doors afterwards.
00:46:05,00:46:06,So cool.
00:46:06,00:46:11,And it also reminded me of another cool system they have in Thailand where you are...
00:46:11,00:46:13,And I discovered this because my friend lived in Thailand
00:46:13,00:46:16,and she came back to pick up her car one day in a multi-storey car park.
00:46:16,00:46:20,"There was another car parked in front and a Thai person nearby explained,"
00:46:20,00:46:22,"""That's fine. They will have left the handbrake on."""
00:46:22,00:46:25,"And in Thailand, you can park blocking people in"
00:46:25,00:46:28,"as long as you leave the handbrake off so that when they arrive,"
00:46:28,00:46:31,they can push your car out of the way and get their car out.
00:46:31,00:46:33,That's amazing. So good.
00:46:33,00:46:34,That's very funny.
00:46:34,00:46:36,A few things on the Blitz.
00:46:36,00:46:39,"So the Blitz London gets a lot of the headlines,"
00:46:39,00:46:43,but the rest of the country was hit and of course Sheffield was hit quite badly
00:46:43,00:46:48,"because according to JBS Haldane, there was a half a square mile of Sheffield"
00:46:48,00:46:53,that was more vital for production of munitions than anywhere else in Britain.
00:46:53,00:46:57,"Basically, it was the only place in the UK where you made these armor-piercing shells in Sheffield"
00:46:57,00:47:00,"and so the Germans were really, really keen to bomb it."
00:47:00,00:47:04,"It was called Schmitzstegel, which means crucible."
00:47:04,00:47:07,"And basically, yeah, the whole city got hit quite badly."
00:47:07,00:47:10,There was a woman who was fined £3
00:47:10,00:47:13,"because even though she blacked out her house curtains before leaving,"
00:47:13,00:47:15,she'd left a light on which she weren't allowed to do
00:47:15,00:47:17,because the bombers would be able to see it.
00:47:17,00:47:18,Right.
00:47:18,00:47:20,She said she'd left the light on for her cat
00:47:20,00:47:24,and the cat had moved the curtains to kind of...
00:47:24,00:47:26,"It could have been a German cat, I'm thinking."
00:47:26,00:47:28,Sounds like it.
00:47:28,00:47:32,"And the hospital, the top brass, they all had tin hats"
00:47:32,00:47:35,but the nurses had to make do with chamber pots on their heads
00:47:35,00:47:37,that was held on with sandwiches.
00:47:37,00:47:39,There's amazing pictures of them doing that.
00:47:39,00:47:43,"And they would go out to the moors and they would collect sphagnum moss,"
00:47:43,00:47:47,which they would use...
00:47:47,00:47:51,"If you know, you know."
00:47:51,00:47:54,They would use to sterilise wounds and stuff like that.
00:47:54,00:47:56,"So yeah, wow."
00:47:56,00:47:59,I read a couple of headlines about the Sheffield Blitz.
00:47:59,00:48:02,"There was a fact from the Sheffield Star which wrote,"
00:48:02,00:48:05,"""Sheffield has braced themselves for air attack from the moment war was declared."
00:48:05,00:48:08,"""People couldn't understand why Sheffield was not hit sooner."""
00:48:08,00:48:10,Very much like...
00:48:10,00:48:12,Come on.
00:48:12,00:48:14,I love this line so much.
00:48:14,00:48:18,"""Yorkshire soldiers were reported to have pledged to avenge Hitler's raids on the city."
00:48:18,00:48:23,"""He made a bad mistake bombing Sheffield,"" they said."
00:48:23,00:48:25,"Like, that's just quite... That's very nice and proud."
00:48:25,00:48:28,I do think invading Russia was the bigger mistake of the war.
00:48:28,00:48:29,"But like, Sheffield was..."
00:48:29,00:48:31,"It's Honest Deathbed, biggest regret."
00:48:31,00:48:33,Sheffield.
00:48:39,00:48:41,"Okay, that is it. That is all of our facts."
