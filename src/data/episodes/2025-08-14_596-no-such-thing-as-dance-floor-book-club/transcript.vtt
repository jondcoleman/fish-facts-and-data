 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.760
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.640
 as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week coming to you live

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.440
 from the Crossed Wires Festival in Sheffield.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:31.280
 [CHEERING]

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.200
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.640
 I am sitting here with Anna Toshinsky, Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.960
 and James Harkin.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.200
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.000
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.120
 and in no particular order, here we go,

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.200
 starting with fact number one, and that is Andy.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.840
 My fact is, in the 19th century, some Hungarian cavalry

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.640
 officers got extra pay specifically

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.520
 because they had to spend so much money on wax

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.760
 for their enormous moustaches.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.200
 So we have on the screen here an enormous military moustache.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.360
 This was the age of the moustache, the 19th century.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.080
 There was an officer called the Hussar, very impressive.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.120
 The Hungarian Hussars were the pride of Europe, amazing.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.360
 And there was a writer called John Padgett,

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.560
 who was touring Europe in the 1830s,

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.280
 and he was in Hungary.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.040
 He reported they were up to a foot long these moustaches.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.520
 They were just incredibly stiff and waxed,

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.880
 and there was supposedly a little extra stipend

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.280
 for buying your moustache wax.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.040
 Do you think it's--

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.200
 An advantage of someone shooting at you

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.800
 because you're a bigger target.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.720
 They might hit the moustache, and it doesn't hurt so much.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.280
 Yes.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.040
 Yes, I do.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.320
 Interesting theory.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.800
 You say yes, you do, but I'm not getting that vibe from you.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.160
 I think it's an interesting thing because John Padgett

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.840
 was going around, and he was interviewing people over there.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.480
 And they were saying, the idea of not having a moustache at all,

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.800
 let alone a ginormous one that required wax,

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.480
 was an alien notion to some of them.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.680
 They were like, that is what men literally have.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.960
 You are not a man unless you have a moustache.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.480
 How do you distinguish between men and women in the UK

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.880
 is what they were asking.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.840
 There are other ways.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.840
 They never found them.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.560
 And that's why the Hungarian population has died out.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.600
 In the 19th century, around the time this is happening,

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.800
 a lot of people are trying to prove various ethnic boundaries

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.600
 and saying, these people are from one race.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.000
 These people were from another race.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.440
 It was a big time for that.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.160
 But a lot of them, I was reading articles,

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.080
 they really struggled with Hungarians

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.520
 because they couldn't compare their mouths

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.000
 because they couldn't see their mouths

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.120
 because they had such massive moustaches.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.440
 There was a quote, "The machas," which is the Hungarians,

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.400
 are not only a moustachioed people,

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.560
 but also one that is proud of a moustache

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.120
 that recognizes it as a basic element of honor and respectability.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.360
 That's amazing as well because you'd never have to worry

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.360
 about someone lip-reading you, right?

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.640
 There's just a wall of hair stopping.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.520
 But it doesn't grow out of your mouth.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.840
 No, but Anna...

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.040
 Can it grow down over it, really?

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.800
 Yeah, you can get one of the waterfall ones.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.040
 Those are lovely, you know, they're like curtains, yeah.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.040
 They don't sound lovely,

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.600
 but I think there often is a disparity

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.480
 between what women think of moustaches

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.880
 in terms of how attractive they are

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.960
 and what men think of them.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.880
 But it definitely caught on, didn't it, in military trends.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.160
 In fact, it was uniform regulation in the British Army

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.720
 from 1860 that every soldier should have short hair on their head,

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.600
 no hair on their chin, but hair on their upper lip.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.760
 And I think it started with the East India Company

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.000
 and British soldiers went to India where, as is the case today,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.720
 they are the world leaders in moustaches,

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.160
 I would say, probably.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.640
 And it was a real mark of manliness

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.280
 for an Indian person to have a moustache.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.200
 So they weren't going to respect, you know,

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.080
 British Army officers unless they did.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.120
 And so then I think it spread from there and everyone had to have one.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.920
 Everyone had to have one.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.520
 And also in some countries, it was illegal to have one

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.880
 if you were not in the military

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.400
 because you're basically impersonating a soldier.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.640
 Are we talking 19th century or is it...

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.680
 I don't think this is still in force, no.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.280
 Actually, a lot of the rules about wearing moustaches of the army

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.760
 are not enforced anymore and it was World War One

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.160
 and it was because you had to put gas masks on.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.920
 You can't get a proper seal on if you have a moustache.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.720
 Yes, but this is exciting.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.760
 There's new news from the British military on moustaches

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.760
 as of last year, and beards.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.720
 So my friend is in the army and I rang him up and asked him about this.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.960
 And it turns out, April last year, I think,

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.680
 finally the British Army, you're allowed to have a beard.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.880
 - Oh, thank God. - I know.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.760
 Before last April, you could have a moustache.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.600
 That was fine, but a beard was absolutely not.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.080
 There were Queen's regs on sideburns.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.000
 Not like they could only come down a certain proportion of your ear.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.440
 I just imagine in that episode of The Simpsons

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.960
 when Mr Burns doesn't know what sideburns are.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.600
 I know I'm just referencing another TV show there, but...

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.920
 Yeah, but this has been changed, and finally...

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.280
 - That's really good. - ...the King himself intervened in this matter.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.600
 - Did he? - Yeah, and you...

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.040
 He's always got his finger on the hot-button issues, hasn't he?

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.440
 I'm not sure whether you're allowed currently in the army

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.360
 to have a beard but no moustache.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.200
 You're allowed a full set, so I don't know what the rules are.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.880
 The rules were you basically couldn't do it,

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.000
 but you could get an exemption for religious reasons, right?

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.240
 If you were Sikh, for instance, you were allowed it.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.360
 The few people in the army that were allowed it,

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.600
 so like drum majors, pipe majors, bugle majors, goat majors,

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.280
 which is people who love to have the goats,

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.800
 and pioneer sergeants.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.400
 Pioneer sergeants are amazing.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.760
 They're people who would be at the front of a regimen,

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.240
 and they would have a special apron that they wore,

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.080
 and their job was to clear the path for anyone who was walking behind them.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.920
 - What? - And if someone's horse was wounded,

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.280
 it was their job, I'm sorry about this, to kill the horse.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.840
 - Right, boy. - And also, they would cut off one of the legs

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.240
 and give it to the soldier to carry with them

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.920
 because the animals had numbers branded on their hoof,

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.320
 and you had to take it back to prove that...

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.840
 I haven't just lost my horse, like I've got this bit of it.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.840
 - Oh, wow. - It all sounds made up, doesn't it?

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.920
 - That's amazing. - I was about to ask,

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.760
 why does he have an apron if his job is just going ahead of everyone else?

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.240
 But now you've said that cutting horses up is part of the job.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.640
 It's a good weapon if you need it, as well, a horse's leg.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.640
 - If you want to have other stuff. - I think if you're in a cavalry charge,

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.720
 and you're the one going, "I'll foot with the horse's leg."

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.840
 I feel like I would have two of the horses leg

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.840
 and bang them together like coconuts,

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.840
 so the other me thought I was on my horse.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.840
 They'll think you're a coconut.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.320
 That's a very good idea.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.320
 - Interestingly, the thing you were mentioning about gas masks is,

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.320
 it was recently, in the last few years,

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.320
 it was learned that's the reason that Hitler ended up with his Hitler mustache.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.320
 So he used to have a big, big mustache,

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.320
 and it didn't fit the regulations for the gas mask.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.320
 - There's debate about this. - Yeah, absolutely.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.320
 But this is from a biographer who knew him at the time who writes it.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.320
 So it's a kind of, it's a firsthand account of someone's opinion,

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.320
 but absolutely, it's one of those contentious things.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.320
 - I thought he was harking back to old-school Prussian stuff.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.320
 I should say this fact comes from an article about,

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.320
 why don't politicians have mustaches anymore,

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.320
 in which Hitler plays a key role, I would say.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.320
 (laughter)

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.320
 - So the other thing is, apparently pilots on airplanes

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.320
 have that similar thing about not having beards

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.320
 because they have to be able to get the mask on

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.320
 if they lose oxygen and the oxygen mask come down.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.320
 So it could catch on fire.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.320
 - Hang on, when they give us the safety briefing at the start,

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.320
 they never say, "Quickly shave your beard off,"

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.320
 and then apply the oxygen mask.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.320
 It's actually like bearded to the goners.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.320
 - I think so too.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.320
 - It really struck me that the battle between beards and moustache,

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.320
 like they're on opposite sides of the fight, aren't they?

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.320
 Because as soon as a beard becomes popular,

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.320
 a moustache is just part of a beard.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.320
 Or in fact, and I really like this quote,

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.320
 there was a novelist called Frank Richardson in the 19th century

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:49.320
 who said, "Moustaches get lost in the general face fungus."

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.320
 That is the popular beard.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.320
 So I think it was quite good for moustaches

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.320
 when people like Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:01.320
 in the 19th century started to discover that bacteria caused infections

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:05.320
 because suddenly people were losing their beards left, right and centre

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.320
 because the idea was that lots of bacteria was going to get caught in them.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.320
 And in fact, there was a 1907 experiment

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:17.320
 where they made a woman kiss a very hirsute on the face man

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:22.320
 and found that he was polluted with tuberculosis and diphtheria bacteria

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.320
 as well as food particles and a hair from a spider's leg.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:29.320
 Where did they get this man from?

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.320
 It's just in every man.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.320
 You've probably got all of that in your beard right now, James.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.320
 I don't deny it.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.320
 So this is a lot about men in the army and stuff like that

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.320
 because we're talking about moustaches.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.320
 But there is Manuela Seons,

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.320
 who's an Ecuadorian revolutionary female

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.320
 who used to wear a moustache.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.320
 A false or...

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.320
 No, real.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.320
 No, no, she didn't grow one.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.320
 She was in the battle of Ayacuchco.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.320
 And as Prusa was there,

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.320
 she carried around the moustache that she'd taken off a dead enemy.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:04.320
 And she would wear it at masquerade balls.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:08.320
 So she would go around and wear this moustache as just Prusa.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.320
 This woman was one of Bolivar's people

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:14.320
 and actually was in a relationship with Bolivar for a lot of the time.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.320
 Because I won the most important Ecuadorian revolutionaries.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.320
 It just feels very hard to take a moustache off someone you've...

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.320
 That's quite an operation to shave off a...

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.320
 I don't think you shave it off. I think it's more of a scalping issue.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.320
 Yeah, it's got to come with the skin.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.320
 Otherwise, how do you piece it back together?

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.320
 And I think it's a good move at a dance

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.320
 because no one's going to refuse to get on your dance card

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.320
 once you tell them the moustache you're wearing

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:38.320
 belongs to the last bloke who refused to dance with you.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:41.320
 Actually, there is some evidence that in the 19th century

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.320
 there was a trend for women to have a whiskery face.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.320
 When whiskers became so popular,

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.320
 there were fashion journals that said

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.320
 women would start wearing their locks of hair

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.320
 down the side of their face where a man's sideburns

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.320
 would be in imitation of men's sideburns

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.320
 because they were so popular.

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.320
 And there were adverts for pencils for women

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.320
 to draw little whiskers on their cheeks.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:04.320
 And there was a dye advertised for women's whiskers.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.320
 Right.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.320
 So this is the thing why don't women

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.320
 typically have as much facial hair as men?

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.320
 What is going on?

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.320
 Because there are all these reasons of why we've got hair on our head

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.320
 which is some protection.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.320
 To keep you warm and stuff?

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.320
 To keep you warm, again, hair on your head,

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:24.320
 warm thing, armpit hair and pubic hair is to reduce friction.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.320
 Also where I keep my tuberculosis.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.320
 Right.

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:32.320
 So if these were reasons like friction and heat retention

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.320
 and keeping the sun off and all that,

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.320
 you would expect women to have full beards and moustaches as well.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.320
 Which means it's either something in female relationships

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.320
 or male-male relationships,

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:45.320
 in that it's either to attract and impress and excite women

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:49.320
 or it's something to cow and repel rival men.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.320
 Do you know what I mean?

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.320
 It's got to be the latter.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.320
 Because as I say, the number of people I've come across,

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:59.320
 no offence, I'm trying to count the bearded people in the audience now quickly.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:02.320
 I'm literally sitting next to you.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.320
 I've come across so many people who are,

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.320
 so there's Rod Littlewood who's vice president of the World Beard Association,

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.320
 there's Steve Parsons of the British based Handlebar Club,

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.320
 Handlebar Moustaches,

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.320
 the world record holder who's an Indian man for the longest moustache.

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:18.320
 All of their wives say, "I didn't like it."

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:21.320
 I'd rather they didn't devote their entire lives.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:24.320
 The poor wife of the Indian guy Ram Singh Chowhan said,

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:27.320
 "For the first decade or so, I thought this is a really bad idea.

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.320
 I'm sort of repulsed."

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.320
 And then eventually as I realised he was building a career out of it.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.320
 How long is his, sorry?

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:37.320
 So his is 14 foot long.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.320
 I think it's seven foot on each side.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.320
 That's long.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:44.320
 You could be in every room of the house at once.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:48.320
 But today you can send it to the fridge to get a beer for you.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.320
 That's nice.

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:53.320
 Apparently dipping them in beer is good.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:57.320
 This is according to the Handlebar Club guy who says dip it in beer to keep it.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:59.320
 Yeah, but what does his wife think?

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.320
 Well, indeed.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:04.320
 There was a thing that said he's got a great comeback to his wife

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.320
 who complains about his facial hair.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:09.320
 He always says, "I say kissing a man without a moustache

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.320
 is like drinking champagne without the bubbles.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.320
 And I don't think that is a good comeback."

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:17.320
 Well, you also like white wine.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.320
 Yeah, you're right.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.320
 I think it is a men-to-men thing.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:23.320
 Right.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:26.320
 There was a piece in 1926 of the New York Times which claimed

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.320
 Ivan the Terrible, as Russians are,

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:32.320
 he liked a beard so well that he used to play by the hour

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:37.320
 with the flowing beaver of Queen Elizabeth's royal agent, George Killingworth.

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.320
 That's something.

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:43.320
 I'll ask on behalf of everyone.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:46.320
 The Royal Beaver.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:49.320
 With the flowing beaver of Queen Elizabeth's royal agent.

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:52.320
 Yeah, beaver is just another word for beard.

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:55.320
 Oh, that's all it is, guys.

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.320
 And it's overdue a comeback.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.320
 We probably shouldn't talk about moustaches without mentioning

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.320
 our colleague who's been on the podcast a few times.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.320
 Ann Miller is one of her favourite facts.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.320
 She's got a huge moustache, hasn't she?

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.320
 She always likes his fact.

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:11.320
 Well, I'm going to ask, do you guys think that if you're in the CIA,

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.320
 should you keep a fake moustache on hand?

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.320
 Yeah, of course.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.320
 No, not on your hand.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:20.320
 Then you just put it up like that, and it's fine.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:24.320
 That's going to work great on a podcast.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.320
 We're not going to explain what Andy's doing even.

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.320
 You can imagine.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.320
 But your imaginations run wild.

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.320
 I'm putting a finger in front to be a flowing beaver.

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.320
 That's what I'm doing.

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.320
 It's working like a charm.

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:39.320
 Well, so the fact that Ann loves is that in 2008,

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:42.320
 there was an MI6 officer on the one show whose fake moustache fell off

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:46.320
 halfway through an interview, which is absolutely cracking.

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.320
 You can't see the footage.

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:50.320
 It was because they didn't actually broadcast it.

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.320
 Only the people in the studio know.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:56.320
 But John Amendez, who was the CIA's mass dress of disguise

00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:02.320
 during the George Bush era, the George Bush senior era, sorry,

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:05.320
 she says that you shouldn't go for fake moustaches

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.320
 because they are very uncomfortable.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.320
 So it's always obvious when someone's got one.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:12.320
 And the glue does tend to melt and it falls off,

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.320
 which gives the game away.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.320
 She said, instead, horn-rimmed glasses, very effective,

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:20.320
 because you notice the glasses and not the person,

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.320
 and just accessorize.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:25.320
 So just carry a nice leather bag and a big cigar,

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.320
 and people will remember those two things.

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:31.320
 Is it possible that Elton John has been deep cover CIA over the years?

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:36.320
 [music]

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:41.320
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:44.320
 My fact this week is that one of the most successful club songs

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:50.320
 of all time is mostly used to stop people from wanting to dance.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:56.320
 I got to say, I think that pretty much all club songs make me not want to dance.

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:59.320
 Agreed. I just want audiobooks. That would be great.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.320
 Two AM audiobooks.

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:05.320
 So this is, we'll all know the song, "Robert Miles' Children."

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:08.320
 You know that? [sings]

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:11.320
 So that was a song that was written by Robert Miles.

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:13.320
 He wrote it in Italy. He was writing under another name.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:16.320
 He came Robert Miles because he wanted to go Miles in his career,

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:19.320
 so he had a real destiny thing to his name because he wanted to go far.

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.320
 They do kilometers, don't they?

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.320
 Yeah.

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.320
 A mile is even longer.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:32.320
 Yeah, and so he wrote this song, and he wanted the song to be played

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.320
 at the end of every single club night, every rave that was happening,

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:39.320
 because a lot of car crashes were happening after raves.

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:42.320
 And it was because everyone was leaving the club of a really pumping song,

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.320
 really adrenaline-ized, they'd get in the car and they would crash.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:48.320
 The idea was play this song at the end of the set,

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:51.320
 and it would put a trance-like music, it would calm the person down,

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.320
 and allow them to get into their car a bit safer.

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.320
 And DJs globally have been doing it.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:57.320
 It's obviously not going to be every rave that does that,

00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:00.320
 but largely that's what that song became.

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:02.320
 It was Road Safety, basically, for the end of a night.

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:05.320
 I didn't think I knew that song, and then as soon as I listened to it,

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:07.320
 I thought, "Oh, of course, I've heard this dozens of times."

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.320
 It was absolutely massive, wasn't it?

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:12.320
 It apparently cost just £150 to produce it,

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:16.320
 and it got to number one in Europe, the whole of Europe, for 13 weeks,

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:20.320
 and he was the only Italian solo artist to ever win a Brit award.

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.320
 Really? Wow.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.320
 Absolutely huge, and he died very young.

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:27.320
 He did, 47, very sadly. It's a shame.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.320
 This thing was called the Saturday Night Slaughter,

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:32.320
 or in Italian, Stradgidel Sabato Sera.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.320
 It was a recognized thing.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:37.320
 It was hundreds of young Italian people were dying every year.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:40.320
 I think they might have assessed how much effect it's had,

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:43.320
 because I've heard this song at the end of things like, you know,

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:46.320
 Roller Disco, but I don't think that was...

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:49.320
 Is that the closest you've been to a nightclub?

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.320
 Yeah, I think it might...

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.320
 Well, it's pretty exciting in there, Anna, so...

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:57.320
 Oh, you're still on wheels, so it makes sense, right?

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.320
 Like, that's a good use.

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:02.320
 But I didn't think I liked dance music, and it turns out I do.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.320
 Have you ever been to a rave?

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:06.320
 No.

00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:09.320
 I mean, some of that Roller Disco got pretty heavy, but...

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:14.320
 I feel like you would have been cheering on the Public Order Act of 1994

00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:17.320
 that kind of stopped all the raves from happening in the 90s.

00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:20.320
 Yeah, I've got that printed out on my wall.

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:25.320
 That law changed the number of people you needed at a rave from 100 to 20.

00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:29.320
 So if you had 20 people in an area and they were all dancing to music,

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:31.320
 then you could nick them all.

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:35.320
 And you could ban anyone who was playing music,

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:40.320
 which was predominantly characterized by the omission of a succession of repetitive beats.

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:42.320
 Right.

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:47.320
 And they issued a track called Flutter,

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:51.320
 and in that track, no two bars had the same beat.

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.320
 So it was awful.

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.320
 Well, I know, it sounds awful.

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:58.320
 It was awful. It was really awful.

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:01.320
 But it did the job of that you were allowed to play it in a rave

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.320
 because it didn't have repetitive beats in it.

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:05.320
 But no one's dancing to it, presumably.

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:08.320
 Everyone leaves the rave, so it sounds like it would do the job of...

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.320
 The profits for it went to Liberty.

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:13.320
 It is crazy that they tried to ban repetitive music.

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:16.320
 But the police were really worried. It was in the early '90s, wasn't it?

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:21.320
 So this law was 1994, and that followed a couple of years of national panic,

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:23.320
 sort of moral panic about raves and rave music.

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:27.320
 There was a thing called the rave at Castle Walton Common in 1992,

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.320
 where people danced for five days,

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:32.320
 and it was a free, illegal festival basically for about 20,000 people.

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:36.320
 And the police were just so worried about it.

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:39.320
 The same year, they broke up a party by using a JCB digger

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:42.320
 to smash through one of the walls of the party.

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:45.320
 I know, it was a very, very intense time.

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:48.320
 That sounds more dangerous than the dancing itself, doesn't it?

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:51.320
 Especially for people like Andy, who's just standing next to the wall,

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:53.320
 not wanting to dance.

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:56.320
 I just can't roll a scale. That's the problem, you know.

00:18:56.320 --> 00:19:01.320
 But actually, at that time, the rave culture was known as the second summer of love,

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:04.320
 but it was credited for reducing football hooliganism.

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.320
 There were a lot of people who were going to football matches

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.320
 and who might have caused a fight otherwise.

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:12.320
 Instead of taking lots of cocaine, they were taking lots of ecstasy

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:14.320
 and just hugging each other.

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.320
 Oh, much better, yeah.

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:18.320
 So that's an interesting thing.

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:21.320
 I went to a rave four nights ago.

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:22.320
 No, you did.

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.320
 Yes, I did. It was a birthday party in Margate.

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:28.320
 I got a lot of trouble from my friends there, because I brought a book with me.

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:34.320
 And I do think like 2 a.m. dance floor book club would be an amazing thing to set up.

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:37.320
 So I went the other night and I remembered what it was like to go to a rave.

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:41.320
 It was really fun, but one thing I didn't see there, which apparently happens a lot in raves,

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:45.320
 is a lot of people are sucking on pacifiers, on dummies.

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:48.320
 And I'd never heard of that, but apparently this is a big thing.

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:51.320
 And the reason is it's because if you're at a rave, you're often on drugs,

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:55.320
 MDMA, a big one, leads to a massive amount of grinding of teeth.

00:19:55.320 --> 00:20:00.320
 People used to do that in my world of days.

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.320
 Here we go. All right.

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.320
 And I'm not going to go into any further detail.

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:07.320
 Okay, so pacifiers, dance music.

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:12.320
 Do you want to play a game of type of electronic music or show on CBBs?

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:15.320
 Yes.

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:16.320
 Okay.

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.320
 Okay, so Fidget House.

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:22.320
 Is that a show on CBBs or is it type of electronic music?

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.320
 I'll say that's CBBs.

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.320
 Yeah, CBBs.

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:28.320
 Okay, I'll go just for the sake of Variety House.

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:30.320
 You are correct, Dan.

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:33.320
 It is defined by snatched vocal snippets,

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:35.320
 pitch bent dirty bass lines,

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:39.320
 and rave style synth stabs over glitchy 4/4 beats.

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:40.320
 Wow.

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:43.320
 And I might as well have said anything on that stage.

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.320
 What about Puffin Rock?

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.320
 Oh, God.

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:51.320
 Yeah, clearly house music, dance music.

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:52.320
 Audience Puffin Rock.

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.320
 CBBs.

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:57.320
 We have a very young audience in today, we should say.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:00.320
 They're all sucking on pacifiers on the front row.

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:04.320
 Yeah, it's an animated children's series about a young Puffin named Una.

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:05.320
 Okay.

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:08.320
 Are there any glitchy 4/4 beats?

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.320
 Baby Club.

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:12.320
 Baby Club.

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:16.320
 Is it Baby Club or is it Baby Club Music?

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.320
 I think it's Baby Club Music.

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.320
 Yeah, Music.

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.320
 You are so bad at this.

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:24.320
 And also, don't you have very young kids?

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:29.320
 I haven't actually locked in my answer yet.

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:31.320
 I feel like I might have given away.

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:32.320
 Go up, Dan.

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:33.320
 Club.

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:35.320
 No, CBBs, obviously.

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:36.320
 Yeah, I know.

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:38.320
 It's where all the kids sit round in a circle and sing songs.

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:39.320
 Oh, beautiful.

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:44.320
 And finally, Squee, S-K-W-E-E-E.

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:45.320
 Club.

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:46.320
 Baby.

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:47.320
 Club.

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:48.320
 It is a type of music.

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:49.320
 Yes.

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:54.320
 It's a type of music where the aim is to squeeze out as much interesting sounds as possible.

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:57.320
 From where?

00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:00.320
 From the synthesizers, Dan.

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:01.320
 Ah, okay.

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:05.320
 One of the things I find quite interesting is that the subgenres of dance are basically

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:07.320
 just defined by their tempo, right?

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:10.320
 So, trance was just it going slower.

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:15.320
 And so, the oldest trance band is a thousand years old.

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:17.320
 And they're so cool.

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:19.320
 They're called the Master Musicians.

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:20.320
 Is this like collectively?

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:23.320
 Like how the Rolling Stones are about 400 now?

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:24.320
 No, no, no.

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:25.320
 It's been going for a thousand years.

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:26.320
 Okay.

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:28.320
 They're all still in fitters fiddles.

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.320
 There's been some handover.

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.320
 So, it started a thousand years ago.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:33.320
 It's based in Sufi tradition.

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:35.320
 And it's in Morocco.

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:39.320
 They opened Glastonbury in 2023, which I think just means you play Glastonbury when no one's

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:41.320
 quite arrived yet.

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:43.320
 But still, and they're incredible.

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:44.320
 You should look them up.

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:46.320
 And they're better than anything you see at a club.

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:49.320
 So, performances in their, like, if they do a performance,

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:51.320
 it goes on all night or it can go on for days.

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:53.320
 They play constantly.

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:55.320
 It's supposed to induce a literal trance.

00:22:55.320 --> 00:23:00.320
 And it's on drums and would win mostly lots of circular breathing.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:06.320
 And then it climaxes in this pan-like god who comes and dances around flames and quivers

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:09.320
 and chases children around with olive branches.

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:14.320
 And he's dressed in the skins of four black goats.

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:17.320
 And he's been played by the same guy for the last 50 years.

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:18.320
 Anyway, you can go.

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:19.320
 It's the festival in Morocco.

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.320
 You can go and see them perform.

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.320
 It's the smallest festival in the world.

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.320
 Only 50 people can attend.

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:27.320
 Have a tent or want to attend.

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:29.320
 Yeah, they've never actually set a limit.

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.320
 It sounds great.

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:32.320
 You stay in the musicians' houses.

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:33.320
 They have to cook for you.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:34.320
 That sounds good.

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:37.320
 Yeah, they cook all your meals and then they go and perform.

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:38.320
 It's a big deal.

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.320
 Timothy Leary was very into it.

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:41.320
 Was he?

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:42.320
 Yeah, William Burroughs.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.320
 All your guys.

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:46.320
 Yeah, so we're talking counterculture, 1950s kind of period.

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:47.320
 That kind of thing.

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:48.320
 Yeah.

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.320
 The guy who's chasing the children, is he trying to beat them?

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:54.320
 Because normally if you say, "I want to offer you an olive branch," it's a nice thing.

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.320
 No, no, it's scary.

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:56.320
 It's scary.

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:57.320
 Yeah, he's going for a beating.

00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:01.320
 But I'm sure it's mostly just acted out at this point unless they've been really naughty.

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:05.320
 It's interesting you mentioned beats because I was talking to, so my best friend is Ash Gardner.

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:08.320
 He wrote the theme tune to know such thing as a fish.

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:09.320
 So "Empra, Yes."

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:10.320
 It's the song called "Wasps."

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:17.320
 After he released that album, they were approached by Superdrug because Superdrug wanted to make

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:21.320
 the ultimate electronic song to make love to.

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:23.320
 Wait, Superdrug the chemist?

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:24.320
 Yeah, yeah.

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:28.320
 And yeah, when I did that in Superdrug, I got kicked out.

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:35.320
 Yeah, they approached Ash and said, "We want to commission you to write a song that couples can make love to."

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:37.320
 Was it to sell condoms?

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:39.320
 It was about to lose weight.

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:44.320
 It was about being healthy while you're in bed.

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.320
 So this is how they described it.

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:47.320
 What was he talking about?

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:48.320
 This is Ash.

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.320
 How has this ever come up?

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:55.320
 He wrote our theme tune and then he wrote "Sexercise," which is the song.

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.320
 This is the description.

00:24:56.320 --> 00:25:03.320
 "As written by Superdrug for the release, 'Sexercise' is something of a sonic epic at 22 minutes long.

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:09.320
 This is a melting pot of ideas and experimentation, a synth-laden exploration of pure passion."

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:13.320
 And there's a few comments underneath that one guy was like, "Doesn't do it for me, dog."

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:15.320
 And it's pretty weird.

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:18.320
 But they got paid really well for it.

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:24.320
 What they were told was there's the BPM that is best for being in bed doing the act.

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:28.320
 And that's why the obesity epidemic ended, wasn't it, when everyone started shagging?

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:32.320
 He said years ago that sex only burns off the number of calories in, what was it?

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:36.320
 It was one small meringue without sugar.

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:37.320
 It was one small sugar-free meringue.

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:40.320
 I think there are ways of having sex where you can gain calories.

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:43.320
 I don't really spend time how you do it, doesn't it?

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:56.320
 It is time for fact number three.

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:59.320
 And that is James.

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:06.320
 My fact this week is that children could learn to read faster if all lessons were held in a podcast studio.

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:10.320
 This is a study that was done in Japan.

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:15.320
 And the idea was they got a couple of classrooms and one of them that they really soundproofed

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:18.320
 and the other one was just a normal classroom.

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:21.320
 And they found that the children did much, much better in the soundproofed room.

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:27.320
 The idea is that when you're trying to learn how to read or learn how to speak, you're listening to your teacher

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:30.320
 and you're trying to work out what they're saying.

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:33.320
 But when there's loads of echoing around, you can't really hear it all properly.

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:37.320
 And also with very, very young kids, you might get one of the kids gets a bit upset

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:41.320
 and they start making noise and then the teacher has to go louder and then the kids go louder

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:45.320
 and you get all this feedback of just things getting louder and louder and much more difficult to understand what's going on.

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:49.320
 And so they tried this and they found that actually children did much better

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:51.320
 and even the teachers found it much easier as well.

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:55.320
 The teachers found their job just way easier because they weren't having to fight against the echo.

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:57.320
 So interesting. Yeah, really good.

00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:01.320
 So when you say soundproof, you mean putting soft furnishings and mattresses everywhere.

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:05.320
 Yeah, so, I mean, how many people in the audience here today?

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:09.320
 1,500 people or whatever? Probably most of you have a podcast, I think.

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:13.320
 But when you're doing a podcast, you have to try and make it the room as unequally as possible.

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:15.320
 So you've closed your curtains.

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:16.320
 Velour cushions.

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:17.320
 All that kind of stuff.

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:21.320
 I thought you guys were doing that to try and seduce me. All these years.

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:23.320
 Oh, it's very cool, the sound quality thing.

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:29.320
 Because there was a study done this year, I think, about, I mean, obviously everyone uses Zoom now.

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:35.320
 And if you use Zoom with a bad or a cheap microphone, it turns out people literally think you are stupider.

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:43.320
 You could be the cleverest person in the Zoom, but if you don't have a good microphone, others genuinely downgrade you.

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:45.320
 How interesting.

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:47.320
 And it's, you know, and it can, it applies to sort of everything.

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:53.320
 So it's, you're less clever if you've got a bad microphone or you're thought to be, or less hireable if it's a job interview, less datable.

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:55.320
 If you're doing school Zoom dating.

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:57.320
 And it's just microphone quality.

00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:58.320
 Really? Yeah.

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:02.320
 Again, we should emphasize just on Zoom, don't go to live interviews with your own microphone or anything.

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:04.320
 We're not recommending that, are we?

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:08.320
 But we wouldn't want the kids to learn in these studios because it would put podcasters out of business.

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:13.320
 And podcasting is a great industry, Cross2Wire's Festival, I think we agree.

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:17.320
 Named, kind of named accidentally.

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:20.320
 I mostly say because Andy likes an accidental invention.

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:21.320
 Oh yeah.

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:24.320
 So named in 2004 and named after iPods.

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:30.320
 There was a software engineer, Dave Weiner, who started the first podcast for a journalist called Christopher Lydden.

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:37.320
 And he created a program called iPodder, which was called that because it was made to deliver online broadcasts straight to iPods.

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:44.320
 And then a guy called Ben Hammersley wrote a piece in The Guardian about this new audio medium, which was to be called podcast.

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:49.320
 And he went to his editors and they said, "It's great. Just need a bit of padding. Can you shove it in a relevant sentence somewhere?"

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:58.320
 So he said at the top, he wrote kind of a facile sentence saying, "Oh, what to call this? Audio blogging, podcasting, guerrilla media?"

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:01.320
 And they caught on from there. Just a stupid bit of filler.

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:12.320
 What's interesting is September 28th, 2004, there was a blogger called Doc Searls, and he went to track the number of hits that Google would return if he wrote podcast into there.

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:17.320
 The first time he says 24 times, reportedly. And then it starts to get bigger.

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:22.320
 By the end of September, there are 2,750 hits on Google coming back for podcast.

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:28.320
 An exact year later, the 28th of September, 2005, over 100 million.

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:31.320
 And you know who was really pissed off about it? Microsoft.

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:38.320
 Because obviously you've got the pod from iPod, so every time someone said podcasting, it was basically an advert for Apple.

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:45.320
 And so Microsoft tried to use their own name. They all called them blockcasts until everyone in the world went, "No, we're not calling them that."

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:51.320
 That's not a good name. You know, a quarter of podcasts have one episode.

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:52.320
 Oh, really?

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:54.320
 And I think it's 65% and have fewer than 10.

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:58.320
 A lot of people say it should be higher, those proportions.

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:03.320
 I read an article by a company called Buzzsprout, who's a free podcast host.

00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:10.320
 And they said, "If your new episode gets within seven days, 28 downloads, you're in the top 50% of podcasts."

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:11.320
 Wow.

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:12.320
 So we can get that one day.

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:13.320
 Yes.

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:14.320
 We can dream.

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:17.320
 George Bush was a forerunner in the World Podcasting.

00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:18.320
 George Bush.

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:19.320
 George Bush.

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:21.320
 George Bush is senior weirdly, yeah.

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:24.320
 Very rare to have a double Bush podcast. Nice.

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:28.320
 Double Bush and a beaver.

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:37.320
 This was George Bush the younger, and he released his presidential weekly address as a podcast in the kind of latest 2000, I think 2008-ish, which was pretty impressive.

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:41.320
 And he used to sometimes deliver it in Spanish, which is like good on him.

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:47.320
 But then I watched a little interview with one of his Hispanic colleagues who remembered that journalists would come up to him all the time and say,

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:51.320
 "Isn't it great that your colleague, the president, George Bush, speaks Spanish as well?"

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:55.320
 And he said he never wanted to say to them, "He doesn't speak Spanish."

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:57.320
 He wasn't just making it up.

00:30:57.320 --> 00:31:02.320
 He does try to speak Spanish, he said, and that's good enough.

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:08.320
 There's quite a few podcasts out there when you look into the history of it that arguably are the first podcast.

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:14.320
 I tried to look into it, accidentally found out the oldest podcaster in theory, as in current age.

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:17.320
 And there's a guy. There was an article that went out this year.

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:20.320
 He's 100 years old, and he has started making a podcast.

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:26.320
 He's called George Hall, and he was Lawrence Olivier's voice coach.

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:28.320
 So cool.

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:36.320
 Yeah, so he's basically dishing interesting anecdotes about Lord Olivier, his wife, people that he knew.

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:44.320
 Apparently, in one of the interviews, he says that Olivier was going through a phase of being absolutely obsessed about colonic irrigation.

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:49.320
 This is the kind of juice we're getting from George Hall at this point.

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:52.320
 We should mention the elephant in the room in the podcasting world.

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:55.320
 Joe Rogan, have you heard of it? Big deal.

00:31:55.320 --> 00:32:00.320
 If you listen to Joe Rogan, which someone in the audience just said, "Nope."

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:07.320
 Well, lots of people do, but if you do listen to it, American women will be less interested in you as a partner.

00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:11.320
 And this was a survey that was done.

00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:18.320
 It's another beard and moustache situation. Everyone thinks it makes the moral traction.

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:20.320
 Is it for men or is it for, yeah?

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:23.320
 American women between 18 and 34 were surveyed about what was a turn-off for them.

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:27.320
 So 55% said definite turn-off in a partner if they listened to Joe Rogan.

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:31.320
 I just thought some of the other turn-offs were quite interesting about where we are, like societally.

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:35.320
 They send green texts. That's a red flag for 7% of women.

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:37.320
 What is that about recycling?

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:41.320
 I think it's not having an iPhone. I think it's sort of that.

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:44.320
 Instead of the blue ones if you're on an iPhone.

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:46.320
 Then there were some very weird red flags.

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:49.320
 "Researching for best deals and rates before buying."

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:53.320
 2% of American women said, "No, that's not for me."

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:57.320
 They read. 1% said, "Red flag."

00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:01.320
 They look better in person. 1% said, "Red flag."

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:03.320
 Interesting.

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:07.320
 Whereas when men, American men of the same age were asked about women,

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:12.320
 for them the biggest red flag they identify as a communist. 64% red flag.

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:16.320
 You've got to keep those red flags fired, haven't you?

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:24.320
 I think it's hard, the earliest podcast, because basically before podcasts you had distributing cassette tapes around the place.

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:27.320
 I feel like that was the original podcast, was bootleg cassette tapes.

00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:33.320
 Because the thing about podcasting is that you're free of all the constraints of having to produce a show which has all this oversight, right?

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:38.320
 That's why there's so much shit out there, it's because there's kind of no standards imposed.

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:44.320
 Again, we want to say that podcasting is a great industry and that this festival does really good jobs.

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:46.320
 Of course, yes, all of that stuff.

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:51.320
 But Russia did a strong line in that, I hadn't realised during the Cold War.

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:58.320
 So there was Samizdat in Russia, which was the quite famous distribution of the written word.

00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:03.320
 It was banned stuff, exactly, like soldier needs in or banned authors.

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:08.320
 You'd type things out endlessly and then you'd send them to your friends and they'd retype them and send them to their friends.

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:13.320
 And then there was this thing called Magnitizdat, which was publishing by tape recorder.

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:18.320
 And I think this is the original podcasting where basically you record yourself into a tape saying,

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:22.320
 "I'm not a huge Russian fan or something, don't like Stalin."

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:24.320
 And then you'd send it to your mates and you'd say,

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:27.320
 "Can you listen to this and then make a copy of it and send it to your friends?"

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:34.320
 And for some of these broadcasts, millions of people would end up hearing, apparently, which seems incredible.

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:36.320
 Patrons saying to podcasting?

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:37.320
 We have one?

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:38.320
 We do.

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:39.320
 Well, it's unofficial.

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:42.320
 It was organised by some trainee priests in Birmingham.

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:44.320
 [laughter]

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:50.320
 But they named Saint George Pricker as the unofficial patron saint of podcasting

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:54.320
 because he worked sort of spreading the values of the gospel

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:58.320
 and he would send out lots of books and prayer booklets

00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:01.320
 and he did lots of talking to people and that kind of thing.

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:02.320
 So he's a real saint?

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:03.320
 He's a real person.

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:04.320
 He's a real person.

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:11.320
 His miracle that made him a saint was that he saw a 12-year-old boy pushing a cart full of manure

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:15.320
 and then when he went to help him, he put his hand on the cart

00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:19.320
 and felt an extraordinary spiritual sweetness from the manure.

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:20.320
 Wow.

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:21.320
 Also, what?

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:26.320
 I don't know why pushing shit around makes you a patron saint of podcasting, but...

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:31.320
 Well, also, he did a miraculous thing where he was able to get you 20% off your express VPN

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:33.320
 whenever you put in an offer code.

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:35.320
 Do you know there is a thing now?

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:39.320
 This is a practice that's going on where people are setting up entire podcasts

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:41.320
 so that they can secure business meetings.

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:45.320
 So if you want to get in touch with someone in your industry who you admire

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:49.320
 and you might write to them on LinkedIn, you might send them a cold email

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:50.320
 and you might never hear from them.

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:53.320
 But if you write to them and say, "Would you like to appear on my podcast?"

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:55.320
 there's a much bigger chance they'll say, "Oh yeah, I'd love to."

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:56.320
 Wow.

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:59.320
 So people are just setting up entire podcasts which have like four listeners

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:02.320
 simply because it's a prestigious thing to be asked to do.

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:03.320
 Yeah.

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:04.320
 I thought that was why we were doing it.

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:06.320
 I can't even remember who we were trying to meet.

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:11.320
 Hey guys, I need to move us on to our next fact.

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:13.320
 Can I tell you one last good podcast name?

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:14.320
 Yeah.

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:17.320
 There's a podcast all about the horses in Lord of the Rings.

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:19.320
 Each episode is up to three hours long.

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:21.320
 I just love the name.

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:22.320
 Horses in Lord of the Rings.

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:25.320
 The title of the podcast is Shadow Facts.

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:28.320
 That is good.

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:29.320
 Lovely.

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:40.320
 All right, we need to get to our final fact of the show and that is Anna.

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:46.320
 My fact this week is that Second World War bombings were useful for freeing up parking spaces.

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:52.320
 So every cloud, I think you'll find.

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:58.320
 This, yeah, it's hard to get the quantity, but basically in Second World War,

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:01.320
 you may or may not know there was quite a lot of aerial bombing campaigns.

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:04.320
 The Blitz being a famous example.

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:09.320
 And what that did was flatten a lot of buildings and leave an enormous amount of space in the middle of cities

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:15.320
 where, well, for example, the big car parking franchise, NCP Car Parks in the UK,

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:19.320
 they founded their first car park on a bomb site in Red Lion Square in Hoban.

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:22.320
 That was in 1948 and lots more followed.

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:27.320
 And if you watch kind of bulletins at the time, there was kind of a panic in the 1950s

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:31.320
 because car ownership was going up and up that there wouldn't be any parking spaces left.

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:37.320
 But I was watching a bulletin saying, fortunately, at the moment, we've got so many massive bomb sites

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:42.320
 with no buildings on them that we have managed to find space to park all the cars until now.

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:47.320
 But if we don't have another bombing campaign soon, we'll have nowhere to put the cars.

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:50.320
 They didn't say that, but it was implied.

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:54.320
 It's incredible the story of that first car park.

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:58.320
 Okay, this is really fun, I promise.

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:01.320
 And if you doubt it halfway through, just remember, it is really, really fun.

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:04.320
 Okay, that one in Red Lion Square in Hoban.

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:08.320
 So, 1948, founded by two guys called Donald Gosling and Ronald Hobson,

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:11.320
 and they were told, this will never work.

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:14.320
 That's a stupid idea. You can park on the side of the road anytime,

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:19.320
 and no one's going to pay one shilling and sixpence for an entire day's parking in central London.

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:21.320
 They were just told, don't do it.

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:24.320
 I'm just sorry to cut you off, but how many cars did we have at the time?

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:25.320
 Was it a problem parking?

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:27.320
 They did it now, right? They're very useful.

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:29.320
 You could just park on the side of the street in most places.

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:30.320
 So, we didn't really need it.

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:31.320
 You could park on Oxford Street.

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:33.320
 But they were going up very fast.

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:35.320
 Post-war car ownership was going up.

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:37.320
 Anyway, this is going to get fun, is it?

00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:41.320
 Well, I'm now slightly doubting that.

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:43.320
 Anyway, they bought it for 200 quid, 100 quid each they put in.

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:45.320
 They bought this space for a car park.

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:48.320
 They sold the business 50 years later in 1998.

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:51.320
 Each of them got 300 million pounds from the sale.

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:52.320
 Wow!

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:54.320
 There was more than one car park by that point.

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:56.320
 That's a good effect, yeah.

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:59.320
 The whole business was sold for 800 million pounds.

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:00.320
 Wow!

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:01.320
 They nearly didn't sell the business.

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:03.320
 It nearly fell over at the very last moment,

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:06.320
 because Ronald Hobson, one of the two co-founders,

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:10.320
 he wanted one particular car park to be excluded from the sale

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:12.320
 because it was on Oxford Street

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:14.320
 and he wanted it to be excluded from the sale

00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:16.320
 because he would go there at the weekend

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:18.320
 and park up with a flask of tea

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:21.320
 and study which parking bays were occupied first.

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:22.320
 Wow!

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:24.320
 So he wanted that to be like...

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:25.320
 That is fascinating.

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:26.320
 I know.

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:27.320
 Do we know the results?

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:29.320
 Okay, okay, okay.

00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:30.320
 Sorry.

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:32.320
 I'm sorry for finding it so interesting, but...

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:34.320
 I don't know if you think who parks where first.

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:35.320
 Is it under the tree?

00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:37.320
 Is it closest to the parking meter?

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:39.320
 I couldn't agree more on it.

00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:40.320
 This is an interesting fact,

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:42.320
 but I feel like I've lost the room at this point.

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:43.320
 Oh my God.

00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:44.320
 I think we're locked in.

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:45.320
 That is an interesting thing, right?

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:47.320
 So if you go into a car parking place,

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:50.320
 do you just park as soon as you go in

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:52.320
 where there's loads of spaces?

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:54.320
 Or do you drive as close to the door as possible

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:56.320
 and then drive around looking for the perfect spot?

00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:57.320
 I do that.

00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:59.320
 Yeah, so does almost everyone.

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:01.320
 It turns out that actually, on average,

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:03.320
 it kind of works out about even.

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:04.320
 Okay.

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:06.320
 But people have found that actually a lot of traffic

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:09.320
 in towns consists of people looking for spaces.

00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:12.320
 And they did a study in the German city of Freiburg

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:16.320
 in the 2010s and found that 74% of cars

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:19.320
 at one moment were looking for a parking spot.

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:21.320
 Oh my God.

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:23.320
 It's mental, isn't it?

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:24.320
 Yeah, it's bad.

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:26.320
 A lot of pollution there.

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:28.320
 People cruising, it's called,

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:30.320
 which is much less sexy version of cruising

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:32.320
 than other versions of cruising.

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:35.320
 No, I'm cruising officer.

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:36.320
 There are some countries in the world

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:38.320
 with some really mad parking systems.

00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:40.320
 I don't think we've mentioned before.

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:42.320
 Quite a lot of countries,

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:44.320
 the cold ones mostly,

00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:46.320
 how systems where you have to park on one side of the road

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:48.320
 or the other so that they can sweep the snow

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:50.320
 off the non-parked-on side.

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:52.320
 And they have different ways of signifying this,

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:54.320
 but Sweden's is so good.

00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:57.320
 It's called their datum park herring system.

00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:01.320
 And it's exemplified by a post on Reddit I read

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:03.320
 from an American tourist saying,

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:05.320
 "Sorry for the dumb question,

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:07.320
 but we really can't make sense of this sign.

00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:09.320
 We're on holiday in Sweden. Can we park here?"

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:12.320
 The sign is a vertical white line on one side of the sign

00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:15.320
 and two vertical lines on the other side of the sign.

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:18.320
 The answer that a helpful Swedish resident gave was,

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:21.320
 it means you're not allowed to park on the side of the street

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:23.320
 with even or odd house numbers

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:26.320
 on correspondingly even or odd days.

00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:28.320
 [laughter]

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:30.320
 So there you go.

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:34.320
 So you have to, if it's like the 11th of July,

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:37.320
 you have to make sure you're not parking on the side of the street

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:40.320
 that has houses numbers 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9.

00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:42.320
 Simple, then you should know that

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:45.320
 the sign is three random lines on it.

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:47.320
 In America they have a lot of things like this.

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:50.320
 Quite a lot of towns, especially Pittsburgh apparently,

00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:53.320
 they do this thing where if you go out for the day

00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:56.320
 and you take your car, then you'll put a chair where your car was

00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:58.320
 so that no one can park there.

00:41:58.320 --> 00:41:59.320
 Oh yeah.

00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:01.320
 And they're not really supposed to do it,

00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:04.320
 but really the local cops, they just turn a blind eye.

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:06.320
 Like outside your house?

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:08.320
 Yeah, so you've gone out to the shops,

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:10.320
 but you don't want anyone to park right outside your house.

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:12.320
 You've got a chair there and then no one else will park it.

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:15.320
 And everyone kind of knows that that's the way that we do things.

00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:17.320
 And then according to the economists,

00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:19.320
 in Shanghai they do the same thing,

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:22.320
 but people get their elderly relatives to sit in parking spaces.

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:24.320
 No chair?

00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:26.320
 I've seen there is a chair.

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:28.320
 There's a granny on the ground.

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:30.320
 I was reading about UK car parks

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:35.320
 and I found that in 2004, Focus, the science magazine,

00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:40.320
 they were given a brief to come up with the ten most secure places on Earth.

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:43.320
 And those places included Saddam's Baghdad Bunker,

00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:48.320
 the Mormon Church Records, Fort Knox, Air Force One,

00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:52.320
 and a car park in Derby called Bald Lane.

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:53.320
 Right?

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:56.320
 And you know how I was an hour late for the podcast today?

00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:57.320
 That's where you went?

00:42:57.320 --> 00:42:58.320
 That's where I was.

00:42:58.320 --> 00:42:59.320
 Oh my God!

00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:01.320
 You went to the highest secure place in the UK basically?

00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:03.320
 Yeah, well I was driving past it.

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:05.320
 What is it?

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:08.320
 It's the most secure car park in the world.

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:09.320
 What does that mean?

00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:12.320
 There's a big sign that says this is the most secure car park in the world.

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:13.320
 What does it mean?

00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:16.320
 I should say it's in Derby, not Derby.

00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:18.320
 Did I say Derby?

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:19.320
 You said Derby.

00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:20.320
 Wow.

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:21.320
 But it's amazing.

00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:23.320
 So you go in and they give you this card

00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:27.320
 and then you park in the thing and they have sensors underneath your car.

00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:30.320
 And when you leave, you say which bay you're in

00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:32.320
 and then the sensor switches on.

00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:35.320
 And if anyone moves your car before you come back

00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:37.320
 then the whole place locks down.

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:38.320
 No.

00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:39.320
 Yeah, absolutely.

00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:42.320
 And there are 190 CCTV cameras in the building.

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:44.320
 They have a huge PA system.

00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:46.320
 They have panic buttons all the way through.

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:48.320
 So anywhere you go, you could just bang the panic button.

00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:50.320
 Again, everything shuts down.

00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:51.320
 Did you do it?

00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:53.320
 Oh, boom!

00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:55.320
 Why do you think I was an hour late?

00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:57.320
 No, it's absolutely amazing.

00:43:57.320 --> 00:43:59.320
 And what happened was, it was in 1997,

00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:01.320
 there was a load of crime that was happening there.

00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:04.320
 There was a lot of drug taking and muggings and stuff like that.

00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:06.320
 And the council didn't really know what to do.

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:08.320
 And so they got this guy called Ken Wigley,

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:11.320
 who had invented a load of security systems

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:13.320
 and said, "Do you want to take over it?"

00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:16.320
 And he said, "Well, I'll take over it as long as I can do whatever I want."

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:19.320
 And he just basically put all these amazing systems in.

00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:21.320
 He's like Judge Dredd, but for parking.

00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:23.320
 This is so amazing.

00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:25.320
 So if you've parked your car there, you're busy shopping,

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:27.320
 you've bumped into your partner in town, you give them the car keys,

00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:29.320
 you say, "Darling, I parked the car, can you pick it up?"

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:31.320
 That's it. They're arrested.

00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:34.320
 As long as they've got the car, they're okay.

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:36.320
 Okay, fine.

00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:40.320
 So you can walk around Derby and go to as many vape shops and bookmakers as you want.

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:41.320
 Really?

00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:43.320
 And your car will be absolutely safe.

00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:44.320
 Wow.

00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:47.320
 I think I know one which is as secure.

00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:49.320
 I don't think you'll have found this, Dan.

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:50.320
 Okay.

00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:54.320
 There is a car park in Farnborough that is only accessible on foot.

00:44:57.320 --> 00:44:59.320
 That's brilliant.

00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:00.320
 This was reported...

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:02.320
 This is for the Flintstones.

00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:07.320
 This was reported several years ago, and I had a look on Google Images.

00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:10.320
 Certainly the most recent image shows no cars there.

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:14.320
 It's above the gym. The business is called the gym, I'm not just being vague.

00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:17.320
 When it was first reported, it had absolutely everything.

00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:19.320
 It's got bays, it's got signs, it's got all of that.

00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:21.320
 But the only thing it lacked was access for a car.

00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:25.320
 And that's because it's part of a big development which hasn't been finished yet.

00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:29.320
 So you can go there to this day, but just not with a car.

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:30.320
 Wow.

00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:32.320
 That is secure in the other way, you can't get in.

00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:35.320
 I thought it was going to be a clever system where you had to lift your own car in or something.

00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:39.320
 Like I was actually in Spain a couple of weeks ago, we went into an underground car park.

00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:43.320
 And instead of parking your own car someone stopped us and said, "I'll park your car for you."

00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:45.320
 And the system is you get out of your car.

00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:47.320
 I've fallen for that so many times.

00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:49.320
 I've fallen for the number of cars I've been through.

00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:52.320
 You're on the 19th car this year.

00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:54.320
 You've given me your keys and you watch.

00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:56.320
 And they go up to a parking space.

00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:59.320
 And the parking spaces are so narrow to save space, presumably,

00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:03.320
 that they then get out of the car before parking it, take the handbrake off and push it in

00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:05.320
 so that they don't have to get out of the doors afterwards.

00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:06.320
 So cool.

00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:11.320
 And it also reminded me of another cool system they have in Thailand where you are...

00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:13.320
 And I discovered this because my friend lived in Thailand

00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:16.320
 and she came back to pick up her car one day in a multi-storey car park.

00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:20.320
 There was another car parked in front and a Thai person nearby explained,

00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:22.320
 "That's fine. They will have left the handbrake on."

00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:25.320
 And in Thailand, you can park blocking people in

00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:28.320
 as long as you leave the handbrake off so that when they arrive,

00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:31.320
 they can push your car out of the way and get their car out.

00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:33.320
 That's amazing. So good.

00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:34.320
 That's very funny.

00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:36.320
 A few things on the Blitz.

00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:39.320
 So the Blitz London gets a lot of the headlines,

00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:43.320
 but the rest of the country was hit and of course Sheffield was hit quite badly

00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:48.320
 because according to JBS Haldane, there was a half a square mile of Sheffield

00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:53.320
 that was more vital for production of munitions than anywhere else in Britain.

00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:57.320
 Basically, it was the only place in the UK where you made these armor-piercing shells in Sheffield

00:46:57.320 --> 00:47:00.320
 and so the Germans were really, really keen to bomb it.

00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:04.320
 It was called Schmitzstegel, which means crucible.

00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:07.320
 And basically, yeah, the whole city got hit quite badly.

00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:10.320
 There was a woman who was fined £3

00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:13.320
 because even though she blacked out her house curtains before leaving,

00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:15.320
 she'd left a light on which she weren't allowed to do

00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:17.320
 because the bombers would be able to see it.

00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:18.320
 Right.

00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:20.320
 She said she'd left the light on for her cat

00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:24.320
 and the cat had moved the curtains to kind of...

00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:26.320
 It could have been a German cat, I'm thinking.

00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:28.320
 Sounds like it.

00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:32.320
 And the hospital, the top brass, they all had tin hats

00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:35.320
 but the nurses had to make do with chamber pots on their heads

00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:37.320
 that was held on with sandwiches.

00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:39.320
 There's amazing pictures of them doing that.

00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:43.320
 And they would go out to the moors and they would collect sphagnum moss,

00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:47.320
 which they would use...

00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:51.320
 If you know, you know.

00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:54.320
 They would use to sterilise wounds and stuff like that.

00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:56.320
 So yeah, wow.

00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:59.320
 I read a couple of headlines about the Sheffield Blitz.

00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:02.320
 There was a fact from the Sheffield Star which wrote,

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:05.320
 "Sheffield has braced themselves for air attack from the moment war was declared.

00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:08.320
 "People couldn't understand why Sheffield was not hit sooner."

00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:10.320
 Very much like...

00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:12.320
 Come on.

00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:14.320
 I love this line so much.

00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:18.320
 "Yorkshire soldiers were reported to have pledged to avenge Hitler's raids on the city.

00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:23.320
 "He made a bad mistake bombing Sheffield," they said.

00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:25.320
 Like, that's just quite... That's very nice and proud.

00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:28.320
 I do think invading Russia was the bigger mistake of the war.

00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:29.320
 But like, Sheffield was...

00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:31.320
 It's Honest Deathbed, biggest regret.

00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:33.320
 Sheffield.

00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:41.320
 Okay, that is it. That is all of our facts.

00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:43.320
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:45.320
 Thank you to the CrossWire Festival.
