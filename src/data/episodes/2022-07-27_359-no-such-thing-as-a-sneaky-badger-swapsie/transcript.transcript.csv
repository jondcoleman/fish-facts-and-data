00:00:00,00:00:06,The following podcast contains comments that some listeners may find upsetting.
00:00:06,00:00:11,"Specifically, people who are halfway through reading Anna Karenina and don't want to know what happens in the end."
00:00:25,00:00:34,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK."
00:00:34,00:00:40,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin."
00:00:40,00:00:45,"And once again, we have gathered round the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days."
00:00:45,00:00:48,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:48,00:00:50,"Starting with you, Anna."
00:00:50,00:00:55,My fact this week is that badgers change their bedding more often than I do.
00:00:55,00:00:56,Wow.
00:00:56,00:01:03,"Specifically, I don't think this makes me gross because specifically badgers change their bedding every 10 days."
00:01:03,00:01:10,"Oh, you could have said they change it 15 times more often than you do, perhaps."
00:01:10,00:01:12,"Screw you, okay."
00:01:12,00:01:15,"They are very clean, unnecessarily clean, really."
00:01:15,00:01:18,"But yeah, they're amazingly assiduous with their bedding."
00:01:18,00:01:23,They air it so they have lots of straw and grass and dried leaves and stuff that they sleep on.
00:01:23,00:01:29,"And every 10 days, they drag it out into the open and they pull it backwards."
00:01:29,00:01:33,"So they're walking backwards, pulling the bedding in their forepaws and they roll it along."
00:01:33,00:01:37,"And when they're far enough from the entrance, they kick it away with their back feet."
00:01:37,00:01:43,And then they leave it out during the day to dry and air and get rid of the fleas and stuff that are on it.
00:01:43,00:01:45,And then they drag it back in.
00:01:45,00:01:49,"Coincidentally, Anna, that is also exactly how you clean your bedding as well, isn't it?"
00:01:49,00:01:50,Yeah.
00:01:50,00:01:51,Is this something you have in common?
00:01:51,00:01:55,Sometimes they sleep on items such as crisp packets and other bits of rubbish.
00:01:55,00:02:02,"There's nothing wine bottle in there, James."
00:02:02,00:02:04,It's Tracy M in a badger.
00:02:04,00:02:07,Is this what we're discovering?
00:02:07,00:02:09,"Pretty cool that they have bedding, generally."
00:02:09,00:02:10,We've sort of skimmed over that.
00:02:10,00:02:11,That's just quite sweet.
00:02:11,00:02:15,I've never pictured many animals with sort of bedsheets and blankets.
00:02:15,00:02:16,Really?
00:02:16,00:02:19,"OK, because you know when they say that an animal lives in a certain habitat,"
00:02:19,00:02:22,the habitat is the shop where they buy all their bedding from.
00:02:22,00:02:27,"The upmarket badges, yeah."
00:02:27,00:02:31,"But they do. I mean, if they were going to habitat, they do have items in their bedding"
00:02:31,00:02:37,"that kind of feel upmarket like garlic skins, garlic pieces, so as to create an aroma."
00:02:37,00:02:38,And it's useful for them.
00:02:38,00:02:41,"But I mean, that feels a bit habitat shop, doesn't it?"
00:02:41,00:02:42,It's really cool.
00:02:42,00:02:45,"I read the other day, and this is off topic, already off topic,"
00:02:46,00:02:52,"but in Han Dynasty, China, they used to have a room where the concubines"
00:02:52,00:02:57,of the emperor lived and some of the emperors would put seshuan peppers
00:02:57,00:03:01,in the paint or in the walls so that the room would be kind of tingly
00:03:01,00:03:05,"and peppery and stuff because, one, it was it kept it nice and warm."
00:03:05,00:03:10,"But then on the other hand, it was supposed to be like a fertility symbol"
00:03:10,00:03:12,because it's got lots of seeds.
00:03:12,00:03:13,"That sounds quite dangerous to me,"
00:03:13,00:03:17,"because if you are in the sexy, spicy chili fertility room"
00:03:17,00:03:19,"and you just happen to lean against the wall for a bit,"
00:03:19,00:03:20,let's say you put your hand on the wall
00:03:20,00:03:22,"and then later on you're taking out your contact lenses, whatever,"
00:03:22,00:03:25,then you suddenly got a red hot eye.
00:03:25,00:03:26,That's a really good point.
00:03:26,00:03:29,And also what happens in the sexy fertility room?
00:03:29,00:03:30,People are naked.
00:03:30,00:03:34,What do you not want to touch when you've got chilies on your fingers?
00:03:34,00:03:37,"I don't know. Even when I'm naked in a sexy room,"
00:03:37,00:03:39,I'm really rubbing my genitals against the wall.
00:03:39,00:03:42,"Actually, you're OK."
00:03:42,00:03:44,"It's a good way for the emperor, though, to find out"
00:03:44,00:03:46,who's been sneaking into his concubine room
00:03:46,00:03:48,just by going everyone quickly rub your eyes
00:03:48,00:03:51,and whoever starts freaking out.
00:03:51,00:03:52,"All right, mate, busted."
00:03:52,00:03:54,"Come here, eunuch number 30."
00:03:54,00:03:59,"Anyway, badges."
00:03:59,00:04:02,"Yeah, they should keep chili peppers in their in their sets"
00:04:02,00:04:04,because their main problem is flea infestation.
00:04:04,00:04:06,"Probably help help them with that, wouldn't it?"
00:04:06,00:04:08,But another clever thing they do with their bedding
00:04:08,00:04:10,is they use it as radiators.
00:04:10,00:04:13,"So as well as sleeping on it, and this is especially in spring"
00:04:13,00:04:16,"when they're having offspring, then they'll pull fresh vegetation"
00:04:16,00:04:18,as opposed to dried up leaves and grass and stuff.
00:04:18,00:04:21,They'll put in bluebells and other fresh vegetation
00:04:21,00:04:24,and they pull it into their set
00:04:24,00:04:26,and then they pile it up in the corner of their bedroom.
00:04:26,00:04:30,"And as it decomposes, it emits loads of heat."
00:04:30,00:04:32,"And so in that pile, that pile can take the temperature"
00:04:32,00:04:35,from 18 degrees to 38 degrees.
00:04:35,00:04:36,That's really clever.
00:04:36,00:04:37,"That's really clever, that's very cool."
00:04:37,00:04:40,"They travel far as well to get the materials, don't they?"
00:04:40,00:04:42,They sort of have a 100 meter radius
00:04:42,00:04:45,that they like to go foraging for.
00:04:45,00:04:48,"They also, I believe, are the only other British mammal"
00:04:48,00:04:51,"to build toilets, apart from humans."
00:04:51,00:04:52,OK.
00:04:52,00:04:57,So they dig their own latrine pits and they will use these pits
00:04:57,00:05:00,"more cleverly than humans use their toilets, I would say,"
00:05:00,00:05:03,because they use these as a communication device
00:05:03,00:05:06,"because once they do a poo, they will then spray it with ascent"
00:05:08,00:05:10,"from their glands near the bottom to say who they are,"
00:05:10,00:05:12,what they're all about.
00:05:12,00:05:15,"Is the spray, is that sort of a freshening device?"
00:05:15,00:05:18,"Like, and this is a strange, personal piece of information,"
00:05:18,00:05:21,but one of my housemates has installed in a lot of avatars
00:05:21,00:05:26,thing called poo-pourri and insisted that all of us spray that
00:05:26,00:05:30,before we're going to do a poo and it apparently mitigates the scent.
00:05:30,00:05:32,"Yeah, it has to be before and then you poo onto it."
00:05:32,00:05:36,And I'm just wondering if the badges are doing a version of that.
00:05:36,00:05:39,"Well, so you spray, you spray the inside of the bowl as opposed to the room."
00:05:39,00:05:43,"Exactly. Yeah, yeah."
00:05:43,00:05:47,"And so I don't know, bad as you know, one badger is a real martinet."
00:05:47,00:05:50,"It was like, look, everyone stinks. Here's some spray."
00:05:50,00:05:54,I wonder if you're really ahead of the curve and in a year's time
00:05:54,00:05:57,"we'll listen back to this podcast and go, wow, Anna was the first to do that."
00:05:57,00:05:59,Or whether you're completely insane.
00:05:59,00:06:01,I'm quite working out.
00:06:01,00:06:04,It's been forced on me.
00:06:04,00:06:08,It's like when we predicted Hamilton should be a musical before it happens.
00:06:08,00:06:12,"We did re-listen, guys."
00:06:12,00:06:16,"No, it's for it's for I'm so territory marking to keep enemies at bay."
00:06:16,00:06:18,Right. Yeah.
00:06:18,00:06:22,"And also, I think like it tells your enemies how strong you are."
00:06:22,00:06:26,"So if you've done a really, really good poo and like there's some really"
00:06:26,00:06:30,"good good smells with it, then it shows that you're really well fed"
00:06:30,00:06:31,and you're up for a fight.
00:06:31,00:06:33,That's an element that UFC should bring in.
00:06:33,00:06:36,If Conor McGregor just had a massive poo on the weighing scale.
00:06:36,00:06:39,Come on.
00:06:39,00:06:42,"Snippin went on, this is going to be scary."
00:06:42,00:06:44,"And with scent marking, they also said mark each other."
00:06:44,00:06:50,So they have these anal gland secretions and apparently they're the texture
00:06:50,00:06:54,"of margarine and very overpowering smell, according to pro badger watches."
00:06:54,00:06:58,"But they either do mutual marking, which is where they simultaneously"
00:06:58,00:07:00,"sent mark each other, which is quite funny to watch."
00:07:00,00:07:02,They rub their bums against each other.
00:07:02,00:07:04,Or they do sequential marking.
00:07:04,00:07:07,And what I read in one study about this is that that is like putting
00:07:07,00:07:10,"your own personal advertisement on another badger, treating that badger"
00:07:10,00:07:12,like a bus with your advert on it.
00:07:12,00:07:16,"So when you sent mark that badger, it's going around with your scent on it,"
00:07:16,00:07:20,"advertising to loads of other badgers, excuse me, there's amazing scent."
00:07:20,00:07:22,That's my mate Bodger.
00:07:22,00:07:28,"They've also, when this is the honey badger specifically,"
00:07:28,00:07:29,I think they're technically not badgers.
00:07:29,00:07:30,Are they honey badgers?
00:07:30,00:07:31,You're kidding.
00:07:31,00:07:32,They're definitely very different.
00:07:32,00:07:35,"But we should say international listeners, sorry, that we are talking"
00:07:35,00:07:40,"about the European badger mostly, which is which is a kind of weasel."
00:07:40,00:07:43,We should we should also say it's in the weasel family.
00:07:43,00:07:46,"Oh, my God, basically all my research is on honey badgers here."
00:07:46,00:07:51,"Oh, honey badgers are amazing, but they deserve their own."
00:07:51,00:07:53,"Amazing. Yeah. Sorry, Dan."
00:07:53,00:07:56,I've got another badger who wasn't a badger and that's Charlotte Badger.
00:07:56,00:07:59,Do you want to hear about Charlotte Badger?
00:07:59,00:08:03,She's a badger was the first Australian female pirates
00:08:03,00:08:05,"and the first European woman to live in New Zealand, probably."
00:08:05,00:08:09,The probably bit is she definitely was one of the first couple.
00:08:09,00:08:12,She was transported to Sydney for housebreaking.
00:08:12,00:08:16,She was born in Worcestershire and then she was put on a boat to Tasmania
00:08:16,00:08:19,and she started a rebellion and she took over the whole ship.
00:08:19,00:08:21,"OK, do you know about her?"
00:08:21,00:08:24,"I've read about this boat, this huge women's rebellion on a ship."
00:08:24,00:08:27,"It's amazing. But the captain afterwards said, oh,"
00:08:27,00:08:30,"yeah, you know, there was quite a lot of women involved,"
00:08:30,00:08:32,but you see the kind of one bloke over there.
00:08:32,00:08:35,It was mostly him because if he'd admitted
00:08:35,00:08:38,"that all the women had taken over his boat, he would have gotten a load of trouble."
00:08:38,00:08:39,"So he was like, no, no, it's mostly the men."
00:08:39,00:08:43,But it was basically the women took over it and they sailed to New Zealand
00:08:43,00:08:46,and started living with the Maori's and then every now and then
00:08:46,00:08:51,like missionaries would go over and see these women who were living in New Zealand.
00:08:51,00:08:55,And eventually the Maori people kind of fell out with her
00:08:55,00:08:58,because they'd heard that something had happened to some Maori people on her boat.
00:08:58,00:09:03,"As she ended up in Tonga and about another like dozen years later,"
00:09:03,00:09:06,"there were some missionaries going to Tonga, going, oh, yeah, there's that woman again."
00:09:06,00:09:09,"So yeah, how did she get here?"
00:09:09,00:09:11,"Yeah. But anyway, she's called."
00:09:11,00:09:13,"I know Dan said Badger's travelled a long way,"
00:09:13,00:09:15,getting a hundred yards to the end of their territory.
00:09:15,00:09:18,But that must be the furthest travelled badger is far.
00:09:18,00:09:22,"I've got another human badger. Oh, great. Oh, OK."
00:09:22,00:09:24,It's a guy. He's not he's not a real badger.
00:09:24,00:09:27,He is a human and he's called Charles Foster.
00:09:27,00:09:31,He wrote a book called Being a Beast and the idea was he's a British guy
00:09:31,00:09:34,who wanted to reconnect with nature and he thought the best way to do that
00:09:34,00:09:38,was to go and live as animals and live the way that they live.
00:09:38,00:09:40,So Badgers was one of the things that he did.
00:09:40,00:09:42,And he roped his kids into doing it with him.
00:09:42,00:09:44,So he lived for a while as a badger.
00:09:44,00:09:48,"They went out into the forest and they built a big hole in the ground,"
00:09:48,00:09:50,"which was their sleeping quarters, their set."
00:09:50,00:09:54,They were eating worms because that would be something that Badgers would eat.
00:09:54,00:09:57,They were sleeping in the daytime and foraging at night.
00:09:57,00:10:01,"So they lived for a good long time, a few weeks as these badgers."
00:10:01,00:10:03,And it wasn't the only animals that he did.
00:10:03,00:10:05,He did an otter as well.
00:10:05,00:10:06,He lived as an otter with his kids.
00:10:06,00:10:12,The reason I mentioned that is he also did that scat sniffing that the poo smelling.
00:10:12,00:10:13,"So basically, no. Yeah."
00:10:13,00:10:16,"So by the end of that experience,"
00:10:16,00:10:21,him and his kids were each able to identify whose poo that was out of the family members.
00:10:21,00:10:23,A lot of people are listening to this.
00:10:23,00:10:26,They're really struggling to educate their children at home.
00:10:26,00:10:31,"I think a lot of light bulbs have gone over a lot of heads here going,"
00:10:31,00:10:33,that is a great idea.
00:10:33,00:10:36,And it'll change your sheets more often.
00:10:36,00:10:38,Yes. So multi perfect.
00:10:38,00:10:40,Why do you bring us these lunatics?
00:10:40,00:10:43,I did think I did meet another guy who did that
00:10:43,00:10:45,"called Thomas Thwaites, who lived as a goat."
00:10:45,00:10:47,"I don't know if we talked about him before, but that's right."
00:10:47,00:10:50,"Yeah, he was awesome. Yeah."
00:10:50,00:10:54,Honey badgers.
00:10:54,00:10:55,Have you heard?
00:10:55,00:10:58,They've got badgers in the name.
00:10:58,00:10:59,Not having it. No.
00:10:59,00:11:01,Have you heard of the badger?
00:11:01,00:11:05,Which I can't believe this is last year's big badger for me on.
00:11:05,00:11:07,"And I don't know what we were all doing in February,"
00:11:07,00:11:11,"because this was way more important on the 9th of February, 2020."
00:11:11,00:11:14,A badger fell through the ceiling of the Northampton branch of superdrug.
00:11:14,00:11:19,OK. Can you imagine how terrifying that would be?
00:11:19,00:11:22,Like it's scary enough when a spider starts coming down from the ceiling.
00:11:22,00:11:25,Yeah. A badger just fell through the roof.
00:11:25,00:11:29,"And it ran under the perfume counter, probably looking for some nice scents."
00:11:29,00:11:36,"And anyway, I mention it partly because it got its own blue plaque in November."
00:11:36,00:11:39,"Jesus, we have lower the blue plaque bar."
00:11:39,00:11:45,"Do you remember last week, I think it was, we were talking about Dolly Parton."
00:11:45,00:11:47,Yeah. And what had she done?
00:11:47,00:11:50,"The Moderna, she'd she'd provided money for it."
00:11:50,00:11:51,Provided money for a vaccine.
00:11:51,00:11:54,"Well, another person who's provided money for a vaccine is Brian May,"
00:11:54,00:12:00,"who has given 50,000 pounds of his own money for a vaccine for badgers."
00:12:00,00:12:03,Which. Wow.
00:12:03,00:12:08,And this is because basically people blame badgers for spreading TB
00:12:08,00:12:10,and they want to call them every year.
00:12:10,00:12:15,And they think one way of not calling them is to vaccinate them against TB.
00:12:15,00:12:18,"So they won't, if indeed they do spread it, they won't do it anymore."
00:12:18,00:12:21,I was wondering who would be the first to breach the thorny
00:12:21,00:12:25,subject of TB and culls and bovine awfulness.
00:12:25,00:12:28,"And James, you had guts to do it because now we're going to get lettuce."
00:12:28,00:12:31,"Oh, no, Dan, honey badgers."
00:12:31,00:12:34,Thank God. So honey badgers skin so thick
00:12:34,00:12:37,you can hit them with machetes and they probably won't die.
00:12:37,00:12:39,The only way to kill them is with a bullet through the skull.
00:12:39,00:12:41,That's honestly what they say.
00:12:41,00:12:42,What they say.
00:12:42,00:12:48,"I just say, I went to honey badgers to try and get us away from killing badgers."
00:12:48,00:12:58,I read an essay on European badger sexing and it's very hard to do
00:12:58,00:13:00,because there's actually not too much difference between them.
00:13:00,00:13:04,"And they basically it ends up by saying in the words of the Devon badger group,"
00:13:04,00:13:06,the only way to be sure is to roll it over.
00:13:06,00:13:08,And then what?
00:13:08,00:13:10,And then you could have seen the vagina.
00:13:10,00:13:14,I think I imagine like a lot of bubbles.
00:13:14,00:13:17,You kind of turn it over and it's got either a penis or a vagina.
00:13:17,00:13:22,And then which is which is it?
00:13:22,00:13:24,It's not a sneaky swap seat.
00:13:24,00:13:25,"No, no, they're very tread."
00:13:25,00:13:26,Got it.
00:13:26,00:13:29,"One of the only times we've mentioned badgers before I checked was when James,"
00:13:29,00:13:35,you said that the best way to prepare badger meat is to let running water over it
00:13:35,00:13:37,for several days.
00:13:37,00:13:41,So it is illegal to kill a badger unless you're part of a government mandated
00:13:41,00:13:43,cull and you're out shooting it with a rifle.
00:13:43,00:13:47,"But if a badger dies on the road, you are allowed to eat it."
00:13:47,00:13:51,"And in 2012, the Guardian interviewed a man called Arthur Boyd,"
00:13:51,00:13:54,who was I think it was in his seventies or eighties.
00:13:54,00:13:57,But he said he'd been eating badger for 55 years.
00:13:57,00:14:02,And he lived in the countryside and the Guardian sent someone to interview him
00:14:02,00:14:05,and to try eating badger just before the Guardian spoke to him.
00:14:05,00:14:09,He'd had a bit of stewed badger with badger genitals on the side.
00:14:09,00:14:12,Which genitals was that?
00:14:12,00:14:17,"I think it must have been male genitals, badger nages."
00:14:17,00:14:23,But he said that sometimes you don't have to run it under water
00:14:23,00:14:25,and that you do have to run it under your car.
00:14:25,00:14:30,"But this is the thing, his wife is a vegetarian."
00:14:30,00:14:34,"Well, I'm not fucking surprised."
00:14:34,00:14:36,The other option is eating badger bollocks every day.
00:14:36,00:14:42,"I suppose if it's ethical eating, isn't it?"
00:14:42,00:14:44,"If it's died of natural causes,"
00:14:44,00:14:47,"it's one step away from vegetarianism, eating badger carcass."
00:14:47,00:14:50,"It's a one step, but it's a fucking long step."
00:14:50,00:14:53,It's one giant leap.
00:14:53,00:14:54,Weird step.
00:14:54,00:15:02,"OK, it is time for fact number two,"
00:15:02,00:15:05,and that is Andy.
00:15:05,00:15:08,My fact is that the chief designer of America's first stealth bomber
00:15:08,00:15:12,also helped to design the Dumbo ride at Disneyland.
00:15:12,00:15:14,Amazing. Very cool.
00:15:14,00:15:16,That's awesome.
00:15:16,00:15:19,"Yeah, so this is from a new book that's called Stealth,"
00:15:19,00:15:22,The Secret Contest to Invent Invisible Aircraft.
00:15:22,00:15:25,So it wasn't a book about Dumbo rides that you were reading?
00:15:25,00:15:29,"No, I do have a big book about Disney, actually, but I haven't read it yet."
00:15:30,00:15:33,It feels like this would have been the moment to read it.
00:15:33,00:15:39,Just use it in my honey badger section next week.
00:15:39,00:15:44,"But this was a guy called Richard Sherer,"
00:15:44,00:15:49,who he was working in the 40s and 50s for Ames.
00:15:49,00:15:51,"He was, you know, an engineer and a designer,"
00:15:51,00:15:55,and he worked for a lab run by the National Advisory Committee
00:15:55,00:15:57,"for Aeronautics, which was the kind of precursor to NASA."
00:15:58,00:16:01,"But in his spare time, he was hanging around with some buddies"
00:16:01,00:16:03,"who ran a firm called the Arrow Development Company,"
00:16:03,00:16:07,"and they made merry-go-rounds and things, and they did lots of engineering, too."
00:16:07,00:16:09,And eventually they got a Disney contract.
00:16:09,00:16:13,"So he, Sherer, moon-lighted from his day job,"
00:16:13,00:16:17,which was building serious weaponry and designing systems for this kind of stuff.
00:16:17,00:16:20,"He kept getting these phone calls at work,"
00:16:20,00:16:21,"which were from the guys at Disneyland saying,"
00:16:21,00:16:25,we need you to sort out the brakes and the rails on Dumbo and all these other rides.
00:16:25,00:16:28,"Yeah, so he not only did Dumbo, he did the Tea Party ride."
00:16:28,00:16:31,"He did the Matterhorn, which is a giant mountain."
00:16:31,00:16:33,"I mean, it's absolutely humongous."
00:16:33,00:16:37,"The little train that could, flying saucer's rides as well."
00:16:37,00:16:40,"Like, he's got a big footprint on the design of that place. Yeah."
00:16:40,00:16:44,"And did he ever confuse his two jobs and accidentally in war,"
00:16:44,00:16:47,you could see tea cups looming over the horizon?
00:16:47,00:16:53,Harry S. Truman refused to ride Dumbo at Disneyland.
00:16:53,00:16:57,Really? Because the elephant is the mascot of the Republican Party.
00:16:57,00:17:01,"So he said, I'm not getting on an elephant."
00:17:01,00:17:06,"And basically, I mean, it was just a joke, but it's a thing that happened."
00:17:06,00:17:13,"So there are big links between Disney and defense tech, which is bizarre."
00:17:13,00:17:15,"So Disney, for example,"
00:17:15,00:17:19,"there are robot animatronics in the first Disneyland,"
00:17:19,00:17:21,"you know, little robots moving back and forth, that kind of thing."
00:17:22,00:17:24,"They were controlled by a magnetic tape system,"
00:17:24,00:17:27,which was originally developed for the Polaris submarine missile
00:17:27,00:17:31,and Disney licensed the patent to use it in their park.
00:17:31,00:17:34,"So I know, really weird."
00:17:34,00:17:38,"Well, he got he got the idea from Tivoli in Copenhagen, didn't he?"
00:17:38,00:17:42,"Which is a couple of us definitely went to that when we were on tour last year,"
00:17:42,00:17:46,which is a beautiful fairground in the center of Copenhagen.
00:17:46,00:17:48,And that was his dream. I want that in America.
00:17:49,00:17:53,"And he was very good at doing research, sort of personal research,"
00:17:53,00:17:56,"so far as I could tell, for how his park should operate."
00:17:56,00:18:00,So he used to walk after people in parks
00:18:00,00:18:02,and just notice how often they would litter.
00:18:02,00:18:04,This is this is the story that I read.
00:18:04,00:18:08,"Possibly he had researchers doing it, but supposedly Disney would walk around"
00:18:08,00:18:12,"and we go, OK, this is the distance that it usually would take for someone to litter."
00:18:12,00:18:14,That's how far apart we need our bins to be
00:18:14,00:18:17,so that people don't do it in our park.
00:18:17,00:18:22,Yeah. So he was very much part of the integral kind of feel of all the
00:18:22,00:18:27,"he was reported to the police for stalking on multiple occasions, wasn't he?"
00:18:27,00:18:29,You might drop litter because you're trying to create a distraction
00:18:29,00:18:32,from the man who's been following you around the park for the last hour.
00:18:32,00:18:37,"So I can't believe we've never mentioned this system, the utilidor system."
00:18:37,00:18:41,It's short for utility corridors and it's part of the backstage area.
00:18:41,00:18:44,So this is another stealth feature of Disneyland.
00:18:45,00:18:49,And it was because they're they're so strict at Disney
00:18:49,00:18:52,with maintaining the fiction that all the staff are characters.
00:18:52,00:18:55,So all the staff are called actors and they're on stage when they're in front
00:18:55,00:18:57,of the public and backstage is when they're not in front of the public.
00:18:57,00:19:01,And you can never see them travelling to their destinations
00:19:01,00:19:04,"and you can never see them taking out the rubbish, for instance."
00:19:04,00:19:06,And you're never supposed to see someone crossing the wrong kingdom.
00:19:06,00:19:10,So you should never see Dumbo crossing the Mickey Mouse kingdom
00:19:10,00:19:11,or wherever it's range.
00:19:11,00:19:14,It feels like it feels like a gang system.
00:19:14,00:19:19,That's why they have all the weapons of war.
00:19:19,00:19:22,"So what they have is, and especially under the Magic Kingdom,"
00:19:22,00:19:28,is a system of underground tunnels and that's for the staff to get to certain places.
00:19:28,00:19:31,"And so I think it's the largest wardrobe department on earth,"
00:19:31,00:19:33,because it's where they also keep all the costumes.
00:19:33,00:19:35,And it's one of the world's largest utility tunnels.
00:19:35,00:19:38,"And so if you have to sprint to a destination as a member of staff,"
00:19:38,00:19:42,"you have to go underground or, in fact, weirdly at the Magic Kingdom,"
00:19:42,00:19:45,it's on ground level and then the whole kingdom is built above it on top.
00:19:45,00:19:48,"Oh, really? Yeah, that is insane."
00:19:48,00:19:49,"It's weird, isn't it?"
00:19:49,00:19:54,"Also, the staff have a really odd rule about names there as well."
00:19:54,00:19:58,"So there was a tradition that rumor has it started with Walt Disney himself,"
00:19:58,00:20:00,which is he never wanted to be called Mr. Disney.
00:20:00,00:20:02,"He was Walt. If you met him, hey, Walt."
00:20:02,00:20:04,And so first names is a thing.
00:20:04,00:20:09,"However, there is a rule that if, say, they have an Andrew already, Andy,"
00:20:09,00:20:12,"you were working there, and I arrived and I was called Andrew,"
00:20:12,00:20:15,I have to change my name because we can't have two Andrews.
00:20:15,00:20:18,Why don't we do that in our office since James Rosson arrived
00:20:18,00:20:22,and forever getting his emails.
00:20:22,00:20:24,"If he was called Derek, there'd be no problem."
00:20:24,00:20:26,"Yeah, exactly. Well, yeah."
00:20:26,00:20:30,"So Disney is your best place to go and work, James, because if you get in,"
00:20:30,00:20:32,it's like there's not going to be another James there.
00:20:32,00:20:35,"Come on. Sorry, Derek."
00:20:35,00:20:40,"I mean, they have quite a lot of that they're called actors,"
00:20:40,00:20:42,but quite a lot of actors now.
00:20:42,00:20:44,"Sure, have they reached really obscure names?"
00:20:44,00:20:46,Are you saying Engelburts and Pompadon?
00:20:46,00:20:47,"Weird, isn't it? Yeah."
00:20:47,00:20:50,"Yeah, I'm guessing it must be specific."
00:20:50,00:20:53,Like there must be subcategory offices right within there.
00:20:53,00:20:55,It must be like you're part of the rides.
00:20:55,00:20:57,You're part of the janitorial staff.
00:20:57,00:20:59,You're part of the creepy following people.
00:20:59,00:21:02,"See how much they put rubbish on the ground stuff, you know, that kind of thing."
00:21:02,00:21:04,"I have to say, Dan, it feels like a less good system"
00:21:04,00:21:06,"than the system we have, which is surnames."
00:21:06,00:21:12,Did you know that this is a problem?
00:21:12,00:21:16,Which is that Disney has a haunted mansion ride.
00:21:16,00:21:18,"You know, lots of the Disney's have a haunted mansion, don't they?"
00:21:18,00:21:20,Because there are theme parks all over the world.
00:21:20,00:21:23,"But this is the California one, the original."
00:21:23,00:21:27,"Every so often, the staff discover a pile of mysterious powder"
00:21:27,00:21:31,"on the floor of the haunted mansion, and it is said that this is..."
00:21:31,00:21:32,All the staff take a cane.
00:21:32,00:21:35,It is said.
00:21:35,00:21:39,"But it's not as legally watertight as you think it is, James."
00:21:39,00:21:44,It's said that it's people leaving their loved ones ashes on the floor.
00:21:44,00:21:47,"Oh, well, so this is because people love the haunted mansion"
00:21:47,00:21:49,and they love to go on the ride and it's great.
00:21:49,00:21:54,"Now, this has been furiously denied by Disney, we should say."
00:21:54,00:21:56,I found a guy who's called Rob Doughty.
00:21:56,00:21:57,He's the spokesman.
00:21:57,00:21:59,He seems to spend about half his professional life
00:21:59,00:22:02,just denying that there are parts of ash in the haunted mansion.
00:22:02,00:22:04,"And they interviewed a member of staff who said,"
00:22:04,00:22:06,"""All these people that think their loved ones"
00:22:06,00:22:08,"are going to be in the haunted mansion forever,"
00:22:08,00:22:10,while grandma's getting vacuumed up into a vacuum
00:22:10,00:22:13,"and getting sent out to the landfill somewhere."""
00:22:13,00:22:16,Wow. Where is this haunted landfill that I could go and visit?
00:22:16,00:22:24,"There was a big, big controversy at the start of the haunted mansion design"
00:22:24,00:22:26,over whether it should be funny or scary.
00:22:26,00:22:29,There were proper arguments between the designers
00:22:29,00:22:30,and they were called the Imagineers.
00:22:30,00:22:31,There were nine of them.
00:22:31,00:22:34,"And there's one left who's called Rolly Crump,"
00:22:34,00:22:36,which is just such a strong name.
00:22:36,00:22:37,"He got there last after everyone else,"
00:22:37,00:22:39,after all the names had been taken.
00:22:39,00:22:43,"I mean, neither of those is a name, but OK, I'll take it."
00:22:43,00:22:48,"But he was, his ideas were all sort of too mad for the ride."
00:22:48,00:22:50,So there was supposed to be this museum of the weird
00:22:50,00:22:52,to house all of his crazy ideas.
00:22:53,00:22:56,"But anyway, one of the things that he recounted doing at the time"
00:22:56,00:22:58,"was he recounted the fact that they, the designers,"
00:22:58,00:23:02,"also had to clean the haunted mansion every night instead of cleaners,"
00:23:02,00:23:04,because cleaners refused to clean it.
00:23:04,00:23:07,"And the reason was, to be fair, they only had themselves to blame."
00:23:07,00:23:10,"The reason was that the cleaners said,"
00:23:10,00:23:12,"""Do you mind leaving the lights on when you leave?"""
00:23:12,00:23:14,"Because it's a bit scary, all these animatronics"
00:23:14,00:23:16,and these crazy ghost sounds and these horrible figures.
00:23:16,00:23:18,So can you just leave the lights on for us to clean it overnight?
00:23:18,00:23:21,"And so what Rolly and pals did was they complied,"
00:23:21,00:23:23,but then they installed motion sensors
00:23:23,00:23:25,that at some moments would extinguish all the lights
00:23:25,00:23:28,and turn on all the ghost effects in the animatronics.
00:23:28,00:23:31,That's amazing.
00:23:31,00:23:33,He said the next morning they went in
00:23:33,00:23:35,and the ghost effects were still running.
00:23:35,00:23:37,There was a broom lying in the centre of the floor
00:23:37,00:23:40,and they got a call from personnel saying the janitors would not be returning.
00:23:40,00:23:43,Wow.
00:23:43,00:23:46,Disneyland also has stealthily placed all around
00:23:46,00:23:48,what they call smelletizers.
00:23:48,00:23:51,And the idea is that they emit a certain smell
00:23:51,00:23:53,so that everything feels fresh wherever you're going.
00:23:53,00:23:56,"So if you pass something that looks like a baking shop,"
00:23:56,00:23:58,they'll have the smell of fresh bread being pumped out
00:23:58,00:24:00,from the side of the building.
00:24:00,00:24:01,It's basically poop-a-ree.
00:24:01,00:24:06,No one's pooing on the walls in Disneyland.
00:24:06,00:24:09,You get removed pretty swiftly.
00:24:09,00:24:11,"Ah, you can be removed for lots of stuff."
00:24:11,00:24:15,They've just banned loose ice.
00:24:15,00:24:16,What's loose ice?
00:24:16,00:24:18,Just ice that's loose in a...
00:24:18,00:24:22,I thought it was like a really cool street slang
00:24:22,00:24:24,for some new drug that I'd never heard of.
00:24:24,00:24:27,"No, it's literally frozen water."
00:24:27,00:24:29,You can't turn up with a cup of ice and get over there.
00:24:29,00:24:32,"Have you guys heard of Jeff Wright's, R-E-I-T-Z?"
00:24:32,00:24:36,His Twitter account was @Disney366
00:24:36,00:24:40,"and it said, ""I have been to Disneyland every day"
00:24:40,00:24:42,"since January the 1st, 2012."""
00:24:42,00:24:47,He was an honorary Disneyland citizen and an honorary mouseketeer.
00:24:47,00:24:50,"And basically, he and his friends joked"
00:24:50,00:24:53,that Disney had this advertising campaign
00:24:53,00:24:56,"during the leap year of 2012,"
00:24:56,00:25:00,"saying, ""You can go to Disney one more day this year."""
00:25:00,00:25:01,"And then him and his friends are like,"
00:25:01,00:25:03,"""Well, you only get to go one more day"
00:25:03,00:25:07,"if you go literally for all the other 365 days."""
00:25:07,00:25:10,"And they went, ""Wait a minute, we're unemployed."
00:25:10,00:25:13,"Why don't we just go to Disneyland every day for a year?"""
00:25:13,00:25:16,"And so from January the 1st, 2012,"
00:25:16,00:25:20,Jeff Wright's and a friend went to Disneyland every single day
00:25:20,00:25:23,"and his friend eventually kind of gave up,"
00:25:23,00:25:24,but he carried on.
00:25:24,00:25:28,"And he carried on all the way until March 2020,"
00:25:28,00:25:32,"a 2,995-day streak of going to Disneyland"
00:25:32,00:25:35,until it closed due to COVID.
00:25:35,00:25:37,"- Oh, wow. - He just left them in there"
00:25:37,00:25:39,on his own. - He should have done.
00:25:39,00:25:42,"And they said, ""Are you going to go back when it reopens?"""
00:25:42,00:25:43,"And he's like, ""No, it was a streak."
00:25:43,00:25:45,It was like an everyday thing.
00:25:45,00:25:46,"And now that I've missed it every day,"
00:25:46,00:25:48,"I'm just going to stop going."""
00:25:48,00:25:49,- That would make it pointless.
00:25:49,00:25:52,(laughing)
00:25:52,00:25:53,- He really enjoyed it.
00:25:53,00:25:54,"He said, ""Someone said to him,"
00:25:54,00:25:56,"""Will you ever get sick of Disneyland?"""
00:25:56,00:25:59,"He says, ""No, I don't think I will get sick of Disneyland"
00:25:59,00:26:00,because I like to change things up
00:26:00,00:26:04,"and do different things each time."""
00:26:04,00:26:04,- Wow. - I like him.
00:26:04,00:26:05,I like this guy.
00:26:05,00:26:07,- The training to work at Disneyland
00:26:07,00:26:10,is called the traditions.
00:26:10,00:26:13,"And it sounds, people seem to be okay with it."
00:26:13,00:26:13,It's like a cult.
00:26:13,00:26:14,So it's done repeatedly.
00:26:14,00:26:16,I was reading an interview with one employee
00:26:16,00:26:18,"who was saying that every so often,"
00:26:18,00:26:20,you'll be walking around in your costume
00:26:20,00:26:22,and someone will walk up to you and give you a card
00:26:22,00:26:24,that summons you to the magic kingdom
00:26:24,00:26:27,for more sort of happiness training.
00:26:27,00:26:30,"And said, ""That's all to seem happy."""
00:26:30,00:26:31,It's called emotional regulation training.
00:26:31,00:26:34,And the idea is that you have to stay in character
00:26:34,00:26:35,whatever happens.
00:26:35,00:26:37,"So for instance, I was listening to some people"
00:26:37,00:26:39,who went to go on the new Star Wars ride
00:26:39,00:26:42,and the ride broke and customers were furious
00:26:42,00:26:43,'cause they'd been queuing for days.
00:26:43,00:26:45,And there were thousands of people on this app
00:26:45,00:26:46,trying to get on.
00:26:46,00:26:47,They were so excited about it.
00:26:47,00:26:50,So they went and complained to one of the actors
00:26:50,00:26:52,who remained in character.
00:26:52,00:26:53,"So kept on saying,"
00:26:53,00:26:56,"""Well, I'm afraid that's Kylo Ren's fault."""
00:26:56,00:26:58,"He's the bad guy in Star Wars, apparently."
00:26:58,00:27:00,You better talk to Kylo Ren about that.
00:27:00,00:27:02,Sounds like they're dastardly dealing
00:27:02,00:27:05,and people screaming and swearing and crying.
00:27:05,00:27:07,- Let me get my line manager.
00:27:07,00:27:08,This is Donald.
00:27:08,00:27:10,(laughing)
00:27:10,00:27:12,(upbeat music)
00:27:12,00:27:17,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three."
00:27:17,00:27:18,And that is my fact.
00:27:18,00:27:21,My fact this week is that whenever Stephen King
00:27:21,00:27:24,"couldn't find the audio book of something he wanted to read,"
00:27:24,00:27:26,he would put one of his three children into a room
00:27:26,00:27:27,with a tape recorder
00:27:27,00:27:31,and would get them to read out the whole thing for him.
00:27:31,00:27:32,- Wow.
00:27:32,00:27:33,- Yeah.
00:27:33,00:27:34,- So he is a sadist.
00:27:34,00:27:36,'Cause you do wonder if he's a sadist when you read his books
00:27:36,00:27:37,and it turns out he is.
00:27:37,00:27:38,That is cruel.
00:27:38,00:27:39,- I love him.
00:27:39,00:27:40,- I think he's amazing.
00:27:40,00:27:42,"He's a big, big, big reader."
00:27:42,00:27:44,"I mean, Stephen King, basically,"
00:27:44,00:27:45,"if you ever hear him talk, talks about books."
00:27:45,00:27:49,"He loves reading books and he lives in Maine, in Bangor, Maine."
00:27:49,00:27:50,And there's a lot of roads.
00:27:50,00:27:51,He does a lot of driving.
00:27:51,00:27:54,And he hates the idea that he's wasting time
00:27:54,00:27:56,"while he's behind the wheel, not reading books."
00:27:56,00:27:58,So audio books was a massive thing for him.
00:27:58,00:28:01,"And back in the 80s, obviously, prior to the internet,"
00:28:01,00:28:04,it was very hard to get your hands on audio books.
00:28:04,00:28:06,"And so if he was unable to do that in the 80s,"
00:28:06,00:28:10,one of his three kids would be shoved into a room
00:28:10,00:28:11,with this little recorder.
00:28:11,00:28:13,And they would have to sit there and read out the whole thing.
00:28:13,00:28:14,And they were reading stuff
00:28:14,00:28:16,that was definitely not appropriate for their age.
00:28:16,00:28:19,"So his daughter, Naomi, when she was 12,"
00:28:19,00:28:21,"had to read a book called Raven,"
00:28:21,00:28:23,which was the definitive journalistic account
00:28:23,00:28:24,of the Jonestown Massacre.
00:28:24,00:28:28,She also had to read Anna Karenina for him.
00:28:28,00:28:31,"- Oh, what happens in the end of that, Anna Karenina?"
00:28:31,00:28:32,Did anyone remember?
00:28:32,00:28:32,"- I believe, James."
00:28:32,00:28:35,I think she gets hit by a train.
00:28:35,00:28:36,I've only seen the Disney version
00:28:36,00:28:38,where she gets hit by a ride.
00:28:38,00:28:40,(all laughing)
00:28:40,00:28:41,"- Well, we've really leaned into"
00:28:41,00:28:44,spoilering this in a long-term sense.
00:28:44,00:28:45,- I feel really bad about it now.
00:28:45,00:28:47,"- I feel like, because we've already"
00:28:47,00:28:48,"spoilered Anna Karenina,"
00:28:48,00:28:51,that we can get away with spoilering it again and again.
00:28:51,00:28:52,"- You're right, yeah."
00:28:52,00:28:54,"- I think, and we don't spoiler anything else,"
00:28:54,00:28:55,we'll just spoil her Anna Karenina.
00:28:55,00:28:56,- And it's one of the famous--
00:28:56,00:28:58,"- I think at the end of every show, we should close with,"
00:28:58,00:28:59,we'll be back again next week
00:28:59,00:29:01,and Anna Karenina gets hit by a train.
00:29:01,00:29:02,"See ya, goodbye."
00:29:02,00:29:04,(all laughing)
00:29:04,00:29:06,"- I still don't feel okay about this,"
00:29:06,00:29:08,and I'm signing out of the plan.
00:29:08,00:29:10,But I do wanna hear a 12-year-old girl
00:29:10,00:29:11,attempt to pronounce all the Russian names
00:29:11,00:29:14,"in Anna Karenina, please."
00:29:14,00:29:16,"- But the kids have become really,"
00:29:16,00:29:17,"they are now writers, aren't they?"
00:29:17,00:29:19,Or a lot of them are now writers.
00:29:19,00:29:20,I think he's got a few kids.
00:29:20,00:29:21,- Two or three.
00:29:21,00:29:22,"- Joe Hill is one of them, is it, right?"
00:29:22,00:29:23,"- Yeah, yeah, exactly."
00:29:23,00:29:24,"- Joe Hill, who's one of my favorite writers, by the way."
00:29:24,00:29:25,I've read four of his books.
00:29:25,00:29:27,"I love him, he's awesome."
00:29:27,00:29:29,- But the kids are now so into it
00:29:29,00:29:31,"that when they were dating,"
00:29:31,00:29:33,"Owen King is one of the King children,"
00:29:33,00:29:35,"and his wife, they swapped manuscripts"
00:29:35,00:29:37,to make sure they didn't hate each other's writing style
00:29:37,00:29:39,before the relationship got too serious.
00:29:39,00:29:40,(all laughing)
00:29:40,00:29:42,I think it's really sweet.
00:29:42,00:29:43,- Wow.
00:29:43,00:29:44,- Yeah.
00:29:44,00:29:44,"- But yeah, he did, I mean,"
00:29:44,00:29:46,they did sort of breed good writers out of them
00:29:46,00:29:49,via having them read these great works of literature.
00:29:49,00:29:51,"They also used to, at bedtime,"
00:29:51,00:29:54,"the kids would tell them, Tabitha and Stephen,"
00:29:54,00:29:57,"bedtime stories, as opposed to the other way round."
00:29:57,00:29:58,They used to sit around the dinner table
00:29:58,00:29:59,and pass around the latest book
00:29:59,00:30:00,that they were reading as a family.
00:30:00,00:30:02,"So say it was The Hobbit or Narnia,"
00:30:02,00:30:04,and they would all take turns reading passages
00:30:04,00:30:05,around the table.
00:30:05,00:30:08,"I mean, as someone, well, we all love books."
00:30:08,00:30:09,I think that sounds really cool.
00:30:09,00:30:11,I might do it with my kids.
00:30:11,00:30:11,- Yeah.
00:30:11,00:30:13,"I couldn't believe about Stephen King,"
00:30:13,00:30:14,and maybe this is just because
00:30:14,00:30:16,I cannot work to any noise at all.
00:30:16,00:30:19,He listens to loud rock music while he's writing.
00:30:19,00:30:22,"- Well, I listen to really loud J-pop music"
00:30:22,00:30:23,when I'm writing.
00:30:23,00:30:24,- Do you?
00:30:24,00:30:25,"- But the difference there is,"
00:30:25,00:30:28,and the distraction is English versus Japanese lyrics.
00:30:28,00:30:32,"So your mind gets taken away with English lyrics,"
00:30:32,00:30:34,which I find the Stephen King thing so hard to believe.
00:30:34,00:30:37,"Whereas, yeah, I listen to Andrea Bocelli, for example,"
00:30:37,00:30:38,when I'm writing.
00:30:38,00:30:40,"- But I wonder if because it's loud rock music,"
00:30:40,00:30:43,"sometimes you don't hear the lyrics quite as easily, right?"
00:30:43,00:30:44,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:30:44,00:30:45,- Yeah?
00:30:45,00:30:47,"He does say it sometimes affects his word choice,"
00:30:47,00:30:50,"but it's never his style, so."
00:30:50,00:30:51,- Maybe all this time he's been trying
00:30:51,00:30:55,"to write like really nice children's books, but."
00:30:56,00:30:58,- Jane Austen only wrote romances
00:30:58,00:31:02,because the music available at the time was romantic.
00:31:02,00:31:06,"If she'd had access to the Battle of Los Angeles,"
00:31:06,00:31:08,it would have been a very different career.
00:31:08,00:31:10,"- Yeah, so just a super quick background on Stephen King,"
00:31:10,00:31:13,obviously one of the most prolific living authors
00:31:13,00:31:16,"that we have, he's sold over 350 million copies"
00:31:16,00:31:19,"of his books since he first debuted, Carrie."
00:31:19,00:31:24,And he is someone who also has had probably more adaptations
00:31:25,00:31:27,of his books into movies than any other living author.
00:31:27,00:31:29,"- One thing I really liked about him that I learned,"
00:31:29,00:31:32,"if you go on stephenking.com, he has a page of dollar babies."
00:31:32,00:31:34,These are really cool.
00:31:34,00:31:35,"So these are stories that he's written,"
00:31:35,00:31:38,which are not under contract for movies.
00:31:38,00:31:41,"So if you're like a young movie maker,"
00:31:41,00:31:44,"then you can buy them off him for like just $1 or something,"
00:31:44,00:31:48,and then he'll let you make that story.
00:31:48,00:31:51,So if you want to make a story such as
00:31:51,00:31:54,"""The Man Who Loved Flowers"", that's one of them."
00:31:54,00:31:57,"""The Man Who Would Not Shake Hands"","
00:31:57,00:32:00,that's all of us actually at the moment.
00:32:00,00:32:02,"And another one is called ""That Feeling""."
00:32:02,00:32:05,You can only say what it is in French.
00:32:05,00:32:08,"I don't know what the story's about, but that's the title."
00:32:08,00:32:09,I suppose the story is...
00:32:09,00:32:15,"- Yeah, so it's really cool."
00:32:15,00:32:16,I was reading up a bit on his house
00:32:16,00:32:17,and just the contents of it.
00:32:17,00:32:19,"So yeah, he has a shelf of original audio books"
00:32:19,00:32:20,from his kids.
00:32:20,00:32:21,He's got the dollar babies shelf
00:32:21,00:32:23,where he keeps all of the movies
00:32:23,00:32:24,that have been made off his short stories.
00:32:24,00:32:26,One thing I really like is that
00:32:26,00:32:29,he's been very active in the community in Bangor
00:32:29,00:32:31,with helping to fund the community
00:32:31,00:32:34,"to have, for example, a baseball stadium"
00:32:34,00:32:37,"that was built proper size, really good in functioning."
00:32:37,00:32:39,And so he's really active in that community.
00:32:39,00:32:40,But one of the things that he insisted
00:32:40,00:32:45,with the baseball stadium is that the positioning
00:32:45,00:32:48,of the scoreboard had to be placed
00:32:48,00:32:50,at such a position on the stadium
00:32:50,00:32:52,that he could see it from his window as he was writing.
00:32:52,00:32:55,I read that and I can't find out
00:32:55,00:32:56,whether that's definitely true or not.
00:32:56,00:32:59,"He definitely paid for the stadium, that's for sure."
00:32:59,00:33:00,But do you think he did that?
00:33:00,00:33:01,"That's amazing, if so."
00:33:01,00:33:03,- That's really funny.
00:33:03,00:33:05,"- It feels like a thing that he would do, but I agree."
00:33:05,00:33:07,He's also so shrouded in myth
00:33:07,00:33:10,because he's this horror character
00:33:10,00:33:14,that people think is a Frankenstein-like character himself
00:33:14,00:33:17,that he sort of walks around and weird things happen.
00:33:17,00:33:19,He once stayed the night at John Grisham's house.
00:33:19,00:33:21,"They're very good friends, those two authors,"
00:33:21,00:33:22,and they had the same agent.
00:33:22,00:33:25,And John Grisham's wife was so petrified
00:33:25,00:33:26,that Stephen King was in the house
00:33:26,00:33:28,that she was furious that John Grisham went to sleep.
00:33:28,00:33:30,"She's like, ""What are you doing going to sleep?"""
00:33:30,00:33:31,"And then he said, ""Out of nowhere,"
00:33:31,00:33:35,their alarm system at 12 a.m. just beeped a color.
00:33:35,00:33:36,"It's never beeped before."""
00:33:36,00:33:37,"And she was like, ""I told you."""
00:33:37,00:33:39,And they got really scared.
00:33:39,00:33:42,Then they heard this crazy growl.
00:33:42,00:33:42,"And they were like, ""What is that?"""
00:33:42,00:33:45,"And they ran downstairs and two cats, they don't have cats,"
00:33:45,00:33:47,were fighting right outside their window
00:33:47,00:33:49,and having this massive bloodbath of a thigh.
00:33:49,00:33:52,"So she sat up the whole night in the loud room,"
00:33:52,00:33:54,"freaked out, and as soon as they got boarded,"
00:33:54,00:33:56,"she woke John Grisham up and went,"
00:33:56,00:33:57,"""Get that man out of my house now."""
00:33:57,00:33:58,- Oh my God.
00:33:58,00:34:00,It's not his fault cats are fighting outside his house.
00:34:00,00:34:02,"- No, no way."
00:34:02,00:34:04,- It's similar to when E.L. James came around to my house
00:34:04,00:34:06,and then there were a load of foxes
00:34:06,00:34:08,having sex outside my house all night.
00:34:08,00:34:11,"I was like, ""Get that woman out of my house."""
00:34:11,00:34:14,- Something quite creepy he did in Australia
00:34:14,00:34:17,"was it was in Alice Springs,"
00:34:17,00:34:21,and he was in Dimmock's bookshop in Australia.
00:34:21,00:34:24,"And he basically, the alarm was raised."
00:34:24,00:34:26,"Another alarm, he's got a history of alarms"
00:34:26,00:34:28,because one of the other customers noticed
00:34:28,00:34:31,a strange man sort of fiddling around with the books
00:34:31,00:34:33,and graffitiing in them and then leaving.
00:34:33,00:34:35,So alerted the manager.
00:34:35,00:34:37,And the manager went over to the books and checked
00:34:37,00:34:39,and saw that they were Stephen King's books.
00:34:39,00:34:41,"And in fact, they were Stephen King's autographs"
00:34:41,00:34:42,inside the books.
00:34:42,00:34:44,So they went out with the shop to look for him.
00:34:44,00:34:46,"And he was across the road in a grocery shop,"
00:34:46,00:34:47,buying some groceries.
00:34:47,00:34:49,- That is an anti-climactic ending
00:34:49,00:34:51,"to this spooky story, Anna."
00:34:51,00:34:53,"Dan's had a lot more, you know,"
00:34:53,00:34:55,pizzazz in it than John Gresham thing.
00:34:55,00:34:57,Didn't end with him buying some cool sets.
00:34:57,00:35:00,- I'm no Stephen King.
00:35:00,00:35:05,"- There's another link between King and Tolstoy,"
00:35:05,00:35:08,apart from the fact that King made his daughter read
00:35:08,00:35:10,"Anna Karenina on audiobook,"
00:35:10,00:35:13,which is that Tolstoy's grandmother
00:35:13,00:35:18,"owned a surf who was blind, who was a human audiobook."
00:35:19,00:35:20,- What?
00:35:20,00:35:22,"- Yeah, his name was Lev Stepanich."
00:35:22,00:35:24,He was a professional storyteller.
00:35:24,00:35:28,"And Tolstoy remembered as a boy,"
00:35:28,00:35:31,he would go to his granny's bedroom.
00:35:31,00:35:32,Lev Stepanich was there.
00:35:32,00:35:34,"He was sitting in the window sill,"
00:35:34,00:35:35,waiting for her to arrive.
00:35:35,00:35:38,She would undress in front of him because he was blind.
00:35:38,00:35:40,So there was no risk of impropriety.
00:35:40,00:35:42,And then Tolstoy would be tucked up in bed
00:35:42,00:35:44,next to his granny and Lev Stepanich
00:35:44,00:35:45,would read them a story.
00:35:45,00:35:47,"- Well, that's really cool."
00:35:47,00:35:49,"His name sounds a bit like Led Zeppelin as well,"
00:35:49,00:35:52,which is what distracted me at the very start.
00:35:52,00:35:58,- How was the blind man reading a story?
00:35:58,00:36:00,You would have thought the audiobook is useful
00:36:00,00:36:03,"to be read to the person who is blind,"
00:36:03,00:36:04,"which in fact, what's the subsequent use?"
00:36:04,00:36:05,But he-
00:36:05,00:36:06,- He memorized it?
00:36:06,00:36:07,"- Presumably it's coming from,"
00:36:07,00:36:07,he's reading it from his own head.
00:36:07,00:36:11,"- He's memorized the story, I guess, Anna, yeah."
00:36:11,00:36:12,- Cool.
00:36:12,00:36:13,- But you're right about the early audiobooks.
00:36:13,00:36:16,They did come because was it a lot of people
00:36:16,00:36:17,who've been blinded in the war or something?
00:36:17,00:36:18,They became useful?
00:36:18,00:36:19,"- Yeah, I think so."
00:36:19,00:36:23,Some Americans were blinded in World War I.
00:36:23,00:36:25,And I think a guy called Ian Fraser set up a team
00:36:25,00:36:28,to make audiobooks because he loved reading
00:36:28,00:36:29,and couldn't do it anymore
00:36:29,00:36:31,and experimented with lots of different machines.
00:36:31,00:36:33,"And one of these machines apparently,"
00:36:33,00:36:35,"according to the RNIB,"
00:36:35,00:36:37,the Royal National Institute for the Blind
00:36:37,00:36:41,said that it turned letters into musical notes
00:36:41,00:36:44,as a possible way of creating audiobooks for the blind.
00:36:44,00:36:46,"- Which, to me, I don't know how that would work."
00:36:46,00:36:48,Do you have to distinguish between all musical notes
00:36:48,00:36:49,and then make them correct?
00:36:49,00:36:51,- You only need 26 notes.
00:36:51,00:36:52,So you just go-
00:36:52,00:36:54,"- That's more than we have, really."
00:36:54,00:36:55,- That's a good point.
00:36:55,00:36:57,"- You could go up an octave, can't you?"
00:36:57,00:37:00,"- Yeah, you've got, that's what, three octaves in a bit."
00:37:00,00:37:05,"So you just go, you know, A, and then sad, and then-"
00:37:05,00:37:07,- It's either going to be a very slow read
00:37:07,00:37:09,or it's going to sound like an extremely hardcore piece
00:37:09,00:37:11,of list or something.
00:37:11,00:37:13,The speed at which you're going to have to play that book.
00:37:13,00:37:17,There was a guy who invented a language that was all musical
00:37:17,00:37:18,and he thought it was around the time
00:37:18,00:37:21,when everyone was inventing new languages
00:37:21,00:37:23,like Esperanto and stuff like that.
00:37:23,00:37:25,And he thought if we could come up with a language
00:37:25,00:37:28,"where all you needed was the tones,"
00:37:28,00:37:30,then everyone in the world would be able to speak it
00:37:30,00:37:32,and it would end all wars and stuff.
00:37:32,00:37:32,I can't remember his name.
00:37:32,00:37:34,It was in that book that I mentioned a few times
00:37:34,00:37:36,"called ""Bambard's Bolly"""
00:37:36,00:37:38,which people always ask about.
00:37:38,00:37:40,"But yeah, it's really, he's just really interesting."
00:37:40,00:37:42,"I can't remember anything more about him, sorry."
00:37:42,00:37:44,- All right.
00:37:44,00:37:46,- I think it means everyone will understand each other better.
00:37:46,00:37:48,Everyone will understand each other's insults.
00:37:48,00:37:50,"There'll be lots more wars, actually."
00:37:50,00:37:52,"- Oh, really?"
00:37:52,00:37:53,- Yeah.
00:37:53,00:37:56,- 'Cause that was the idea of all these universal languages
00:37:56,00:37:57,that it would end all conflicts.
00:37:57,00:37:59,But I suppose no one had your insight
00:37:59,00:38:00,that actually naturally humans
00:38:00,00:38:03,are just conflicts ridden species.
00:38:03,00:38:07,- The Esperanto wars of the early 1920s were fierce and savage.
00:38:07,00:38:11,Just on audiobooks.
00:38:12,00:38:16,"There's something, there was a great hero of audiobooks."
00:38:16,00:38:19,"It was a guy called Roy Louis Dotrice,"
00:38:19,00:38:21,"or Dot Rice, I'm not sure his name's pronounced."
00:38:21,00:38:22,"Okay, so he died in 2017."
00:38:22,00:38:24,"He was 94 years old,"
00:38:24,00:38:25,but he had a Guinness World Record
00:38:25,00:38:27,for his audiobook reading
00:38:27,00:38:29,because he read the audiobooks
00:38:29,00:38:32,"for the first five ""Game of Thrones"" books."
00:38:32,00:38:35,And he had to read so many hundreds of characters.
00:38:35,00:38:38,So the first book has 224 characters in it.
00:38:38,00:38:40,He has to do a different voice for every single one.
00:38:40,00:38:42,"He was actually meant to be in the ""Game of Thrones"" series"
00:38:42,00:38:43,in the actual TV series.
00:38:43,00:38:45,"Yeah, and he was offered a role"
00:38:45,00:38:46,and he turned it down
00:38:46,00:38:48,because he was having medical issues at the time.
00:38:48,00:38:51,"So he thought, I just can't play this one role."
00:38:51,00:38:54,So it's quite nice that he then ended up playing 224.
00:38:54,00:38:55,- Yeah.
00:38:55,00:38:59,- I did read an audiobook actor saying that one of the tricks
00:38:59,00:39:01,"is that when you get the text in advance,"
00:39:01,00:39:04,you check for what she called active attributions.
00:39:04,00:39:06,"And that is, if you have some speech,"
00:39:06,00:39:08,"and then after the speech, it says like,"
00:39:08,00:39:11,"she shouted or he whispered,"
00:39:11,00:39:13,you have to check ahead for that.
00:39:13,00:39:16,'Cause you still wanna do three hundred words of text.
00:39:16,00:39:19,"- I would love to do, to write a book"
00:39:19,00:39:21,"where on the very last page,"
00:39:21,00:39:22,"you know, you've had dialogue all the way through."
00:39:22,00:39:24,"And on the very last page of the book,"
00:39:24,00:39:27,"you say he said in his trademark,"
00:39:27,00:39:29,Nick Glaswegian accent.
00:39:29,00:39:32,"- Just one more thing about audiobooks,"
00:39:32,00:39:33,which is so interesting.
00:39:33,00:39:34,"You know, we were talking about"
00:39:34,00:39:36,how they were for blind people.
00:39:36,00:39:40,"And the first LP's, LP records,"
00:39:40,00:39:42,"were made in the early 1930s,"
00:39:42,00:39:46,but the only people who were legally allowed to buy them
00:39:46,00:39:49,between 1934 and 1948 were blind people.
00:39:49,00:39:49,- Wow.
00:39:49,00:39:50,- Wow.
00:39:50,00:39:52,- So it's not amazing.
00:39:52,00:39:54,"They were, you couldn't,"
00:39:54,00:39:57,"they weren't good enough quality to get good music on,"
00:39:57,00:39:59,but you could read audiobooks.
00:39:59,00:40:01,And so it was this great service for the blind
00:40:01,00:40:02,"where you'd ask for a book on audio,"
00:40:02,00:40:04,"you'd listen to the LP, you'd send it back."
00:40:04,00:40:07,"But they had to sign contracts with authors saying,"
00:40:07,00:40:08,we promise we'll check someone's blind.
00:40:08,00:40:11,You have to send in your blind person's certification
00:40:11,00:40:14,so that we don't give free books out to sightseek people.
00:40:14,00:40:16,"- It was that guy, was he called Ian Fraser?"
00:40:16,00:40:17,Did you say Ian Fraser?
00:40:17,00:40:19,"Yeah, and he came up with the technology"
00:40:19,00:40:22,"where you basically make the grooves narrower,"
00:40:22,00:40:24,"but you can kind of, and you play it slower,"
00:40:24,00:40:26,but you can fit more on a record.
00:40:26,00:40:28,And that was like the LP technology
00:40:28,00:40:31,that later became your 33s and more.
00:40:31,00:40:32,"- Ah, cool."
00:40:32,00:40:34,That's so cool.
00:40:34,00:40:36,'Cause you'd really seriously have to abridge
00:40:36,00:40:39,"Anna Karenina to get it on an LP, wouldn't you?"
00:40:39,00:40:41,"We just cut straight to the main incident, wouldn't you?"
00:40:41,00:40:43,(laughing)
00:40:43,00:40:45,(upbeat music)
00:40:45,00:40:50,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:40:50,00:40:52,and that is James.
00:40:52,00:40:55,"- Okay, my fact this week is that in the 14th century,"
00:40:55,00:40:58,a weapon was invented that was essentially a windmill
00:40:58,00:41:01,which flung out beehives from each of its arms.
00:41:03,00:41:05,"- Oh my goodness, we talked about some scary things"
00:41:05,00:41:07,"already on this podcast, but what about that?"
00:41:07,00:41:10,- It's so amazing thinking of what this would have looked
00:41:10,00:41:12,like and how it would have functioned.
00:41:12,00:41:15,"- Yeah, I mean, I doubt it probably existed, I'll be honest."
00:41:15,00:41:18,"It was a guy called Walter de Millimet,"
00:41:18,00:41:21,"and he was a scholar, and Queen Isabella of France"
00:41:21,00:41:23,commissioned him to write a treatise
00:41:23,00:41:26,on how to be a good king for her son.
00:41:26,00:41:28,And part of this how to be a good king
00:41:28,00:41:31,was gonna have all the different like new weapons
00:41:31,00:41:33,and stuff like that that are out there.
00:41:33,00:41:35,And he in fact gave us the first
00:41:35,00:41:37,Western illustration of a gun.
00:41:37,00:41:38,"We didn't have anything before that,"
00:41:38,00:41:40,"or if we did, we've lost it."
00:41:40,00:41:44,"And one of the things that he had was this siege weapon,"
00:41:44,00:41:49,which was a windmill with beehives flung out at the enemy.
00:41:49,00:41:51,"And whether it existed or not,"
00:41:51,00:41:54,it was definitely existed in people's minds enough
00:41:54,00:41:56,to be included in this treatise.
00:41:56,00:41:59,- It's like a really cool concept worship or something.
00:41:59,00:42:01,"You see those all the time these days,"
00:42:01,00:42:03,this is the worship of tomorrow.
00:42:03,00:42:04,This must have been the thing
00:42:04,00:42:06,everyone was really excited about in the 14th century.
00:42:06,00:42:07,- It's like the hoverboard.
00:42:07,00:42:11,"- Yeah, it's like, where's my beehive windmill?"
00:42:11,00:42:12,- Yeah.
00:42:12,00:42:14,- Do you think they had those kind of demonstration days
00:42:14,00:42:15,"where it's like an expo,"
00:42:15,00:42:17,you go and see the latest developments?
00:42:17,00:42:18,- Definitely.
00:42:18,00:42:18,- Yeah.
00:42:18,00:42:21,"- Yeah, that is amazing."
00:42:21,00:42:24,So we don't know if it ever was deployed in war.
00:42:24,00:42:27,"- We don't know, and I suspect it wasn't,"
00:42:27,00:42:29,"because I suspect if it was,"
00:42:29,00:42:32,we might have a lot more people writing at the time
00:42:32,00:42:35,about this amazing windmill beehive thing.
00:42:35,00:42:36,- I don't know.
00:42:36,00:42:38,Bees seem to be deployed quite often though.
00:42:38,00:42:40,"Maybe it was just so run of the mill,"
00:42:40,00:42:42,"run of the windmill, you know what I'm saying."
00:42:42,00:42:45,But bees do seem to be a wartime weapon.
00:42:45,00:42:47,"So that's, you know, just standard."
00:42:47,00:42:49,"I was reading about the Kishay people,"
00:42:49,00:42:51,"the Mayan people who have the Popol Vu,"
00:42:51,00:42:52,"which I think we've talked about before,"
00:42:52,00:42:55,which is their book of their history.
00:42:55,00:42:59,"And they used beehives to frighten away the enemy,"
00:42:59,00:43:03,"in fact, they use kind of Scarecrow come Halloween pumpkins."
00:43:03,00:43:06,And they described it as surrounding their citadel
00:43:06,00:43:07,with these effigies that were built
00:43:07,00:43:09,to look exactly like people.
00:43:09,00:43:11,So with armor and arrows and shields and stuff.
00:43:11,00:43:13,And then they had huge headdresses.
00:43:13,00:43:14,And then they had gourds.
00:43:14,00:43:17,"I think as heads, or possibly beside them,"
00:43:17,00:43:19,it's not clear in the text.
00:43:19,00:43:20,And then they stuffed their heads
00:43:20,00:43:22,with wasps and hornets and stuff.
00:43:22,00:43:24,And then you smash it open when the enemy comes along.
00:43:24,00:43:27,It's like a terrible pinata on a horrible birthday.
00:43:27,00:43:28,- It's a bit like that movie
00:43:28,00:43:29,"where the bees come out of the guy's mouth,"
00:43:29,00:43:30,which I haven't seen.
00:43:30,00:43:31,- Candyman.
00:43:31,00:43:32,- Yeah.
00:43:32,00:43:33,- Candyman.
00:43:33,00:43:34,"- It's also, I was thinking it's a bit like Home Alone,"
00:43:34,00:43:38,where Kevin creates a party out of cardboard cutouts.
00:43:38,00:43:39,It's kind of like that.
00:43:39,00:43:42,- All these things were inspired by this Mayan text.
00:43:42,00:43:46,"- Richard the Lionheart, when he went on the crusade,"
00:43:46,00:43:50,"he had enough beehives to fill 13 ships,"
00:43:50,00:43:52,according to people writing at the time.
00:43:52,00:43:54,"Doesn't sound very likely, but that's what they said."
00:43:54,00:43:56,- How many ships did he have?
00:43:56,00:43:57,- 14.
00:43:57,00:44:00,(all laughing)
00:44:00,00:44:02,- It's just the four beekeepers in the army.
00:44:02,00:44:08,"- More modern times, still deploying the bees."
00:44:08,00:44:08,- Oh yeah?
00:44:08,00:44:11,- So bees were used in the Vietnam War.
00:44:11,00:44:14,And it was particularly when the Viet Cong would be hiding
00:44:14,00:44:15,and they'd be watching the Americans
00:44:15,00:44:16,and watching the trails that they used.
00:44:16,00:44:20,And then they would plant beehives along these trails.
00:44:20,00:44:21,"So they took beehives from elsewhere,"
00:44:21,00:44:24,"planted them on the trails, rigged them up to explosives,"
00:44:24,00:44:26,"little explosives, and then they'd explode them"
00:44:26,00:44:28,onto the hives as the Americans ran past.
00:44:28,00:44:32,"And you just get a horrible sting, nasty bee sting."
00:44:32,00:44:35,- Did you read about the yellow rain in the Vietnam War?
00:44:35,00:44:37,"I mean, that's a really interesting thing."
00:44:37,00:44:40,So the idea was there were all these reports
00:44:40,00:44:42,that yellow rain was coming down
00:44:42,00:44:44,and it was believed to be chemical warfare.
00:44:44,00:44:47,"So the Americans, the Secretary of State,"
00:44:47,00:44:49,"Alexander Hague, accused the Soviet Union"
00:44:49,00:44:51,"of using T2 mycotoxin,"
00:44:51,00:44:54,which would then be dropped over the people
00:44:54,00:44:56,and they were all getting burns and stuff.
00:44:56,00:44:58,"And there's been so many,"
00:44:58,00:45:00,"I mean, it's still ongoing as a dispute"
00:45:00,00:45:01,about whether or not it really was that.
00:45:01,00:45:04,Because what most people who've studied it think it was
00:45:04,00:45:06,is honeybee feces.
00:45:06,00:45:08,"And that's what they believe was being dropped on them,"
00:45:08,00:45:11,"basically not by the Soviet Union,"
00:45:11,00:45:13,but huge flocks of honeybees
00:45:13,00:45:15,that were traveling around together
00:45:15,00:45:17,"and defecating at the same time,"
00:45:17,00:45:18,a sort of mass defecation.
00:45:18,00:45:21,And that's what the yellow rain was.
00:45:21,00:45:23,And there were so many reports have been continuing
00:45:23,00:45:25,on and on where people are saying
00:45:25,00:45:27,"that it was chemical warfare,"
00:45:27,00:45:29,"locals saying that they were burnt and stuff,"
00:45:29,00:45:30,other people saying it wasn't.
00:45:30,00:45:32,- It's very embarrassing to have to backtrack
00:45:32,00:45:34,saying you were chemically attacked
00:45:34,00:45:35,and suddenly you were just shat on by a bee.
00:45:35,00:45:39,I wouldn't accept that if I were the locals.
00:45:39,00:45:41,"But yeah, they've studied the substance, haven't they?"
00:45:41,00:45:43,And found that can only have come from these bees.
00:45:43,00:45:46,And apparently it's when it gets particularly hot.
00:45:46,00:45:49,So it's on hot days that it would rain yellow.
00:45:49,00:45:51,And it's because the bees get super hot in their hive.
00:45:51,00:45:53,So they have to go out and lose mass
00:45:53,00:45:54,"because the more mass you've got,"
00:45:54,00:45:55,the more heat you generate.
00:45:55,00:45:58,"So you all go out and do this mass shit,"
00:45:58,00:45:59,cools you down.
00:45:59,00:46:02,- But one of the theories then was in order to disguise
00:46:02,00:46:03,"that they were using chemical warfare,"
00:46:03,00:46:07,"the Soviet Union had actually gone to Vietnam,"
00:46:07,00:46:09,"collected all of this, brought it back,"
00:46:09,00:46:13,mixed it in to the actual chemical warfare stuff
00:46:13,00:46:16,"because it helps it to have more of an effect,"
00:46:16,00:46:19,supposedly this pollen that would be within the chemical.
00:46:19,00:46:21,"I mean, it's bizarre."
00:46:21,00:46:23,The Rhodes people have gone down with this.
00:46:23,00:46:25,- How would you collect the bee feces?
00:46:25,00:46:26,- You need a lot of bees.
00:46:26,00:46:27,- To mix it into your chemical weapons?
00:46:27,00:46:29,- You get 13 bolts of bees.
00:46:29,00:46:37,- I found one other Roman bee use in war.
00:46:37,00:46:40,"And this is in Appian, Appian is a Roman historian."
00:46:40,00:46:43,"He described this thing in the third Mithridatic Wars,"
00:46:43,00:46:45,it was 72 BC.
00:46:45,00:46:50,"Basically the Roman army were besieging Themiskira,"
00:46:50,00:46:55,"which is a city, I think it's south of the Black Sea."
00:46:55,00:46:57,"And basically the Roman army were besieging a city,"
00:46:57,00:46:58,that's all you really need to know.
00:46:58,00:47:02,But the inhabitants cut openings in the ground
00:47:02,00:47:04,'cause the Romans were tunneling in as part of the siege.
00:47:04,00:47:06,"That's what you do in a siege, you dig tunnels."
00:47:06,00:47:07,But the inhabitants apparently cut openings
00:47:07,00:47:09,from above into the tunnels
00:47:09,00:47:12,and they would thrust down bears and other wild animals
00:47:12,00:47:15,and swarms of bees into the openings.
00:47:15,00:47:17,So if you were a Roman soldier in the tunnel
00:47:17,00:47:19,"and you felt something coming down from above,"
00:47:19,00:47:21,it might be a swarm of bees or it might be a bear.
00:47:21,00:47:24,"- Oh my God, it's like a lucky dip."
00:47:24,00:47:24,- Yeah.
00:47:24,00:47:25,- Yeah.
00:47:25,00:47:27,- It's like one of those which would win in a fight
00:47:27,00:47:29,between a thousand bees and one bear.
00:47:29,00:47:34,- It's like what happened in the Northampton branch of boots
00:47:34,00:47:36,"on the 9th of February, 2020."
00:47:36,00:47:40,"- There was also in the first century,"
00:47:40,00:47:43,"there was, and this was in Asia Minor,"
00:47:43,00:47:45,"there was the idea of using,"
00:47:45,00:47:47,"and we've spoken about mad honey before,"
00:47:47,00:47:48,but using mad honey.
00:47:48,00:47:53,"So this is honey that has a poisonous element to it,"
00:47:53,00:47:55,"which a lot of people, if mixed in lightly into a drink,"
00:47:55,00:47:57,can drink and have a high of it.
00:47:57,00:47:59,But quite a big amount could actually cause you
00:47:59,00:48:01,"to have huge stomach problems,"
00:48:01,00:48:03,possibly even fatal to some people.
00:48:03,00:48:05,And supposedly this was used as a way
00:48:05,00:48:08,of taking out an army that was advancing
00:48:08,00:48:12,onto this city of heptapcomoties.
00:48:12,00:48:13,Have you heptapcomoties?
00:48:13,00:48:14,"- Never heard of it, sorry."
00:48:14,00:48:15,- Yeah.
00:48:15,00:48:18,I tried to look for a pronunciation online.
00:48:18,00:48:21,- Was that where a lot of hep cats lived?
00:48:21,00:48:23,(laughing)
00:48:23,00:48:25,"- Heptacomoties, is that it?"
00:48:25,00:48:26,- Heptacomoties.
00:48:26,00:48:27,- How are you spelling it?
00:48:27,00:48:32,"- Heptacomoties, H-E-P-T-A-K-O-M-E-T-E-S."
00:48:32,00:48:35,- All you need to know is it's a town in Asia Minor.
00:48:35,00:48:38,- It's a town in Asia Minor that being
00:48:38,00:48:40,"advanced on by a Roman army,"
00:48:40,00:48:42,and there was about a thousand of them.
00:48:42,00:48:43,"And the story goes,"
00:48:43,00:48:45,and this was written by a philosopher called Strabo.
00:48:45,00:48:48,He said that basically they had taken this honey
00:48:48,00:48:49,"and they'd mixed it up,"
00:48:49,00:48:51,but they'd left them in pots.
00:48:51,00:48:53,And the idea was they would see it on the way.
00:48:53,00:48:55,And it'd be like finding a bottle of water on the way
00:48:55,00:48:56,if you were advancing on somewhere
00:48:56,00:48:58,and you needed it badly.
00:48:58,00:49:01,"- Dan, Dan, it's a honey trap."
00:49:01,00:49:02,- Yes.
00:49:02,00:49:03,- It's a honey trap.
00:49:03,00:49:04,- Yeah.
00:49:04,00:49:07,- It was a big buildup you made Dan do for that.
00:49:07,00:49:08,(all laughing)
00:49:08,00:49:10,"- I know, giving me all those big words."
00:49:10,00:49:11,What are you doing?
00:49:11,00:49:13,(all laughing)
00:49:13,00:49:15,- Did we get to the end of it?
00:49:15,00:49:17,- It kind of like with your story about the windmills.
00:49:17,00:49:20,It's sort of a lot of these histories about this stuff
00:49:20,00:49:21,are quite disputed.
00:49:21,00:49:22,We don't fully know.
00:49:22,00:49:24,There's a lot of people who've extrapolated
00:49:24,00:49:25,what they think then happened.
00:49:25,00:49:27,Like the army was then taken out.
00:49:27,00:49:29,We don't actually have any written evidence
00:49:29,00:49:31,that it actually had any effect on the army whatsoever.
00:49:31,00:49:32,- Right.
00:49:32,00:49:34,"I think Mad Honey has,"
00:49:34,00:49:37,"well, certainly people have claimed that they've used it"
00:49:37,00:49:41,"so there was Empress Olga in 946, Olga of Kiev,"
00:49:41,00:49:44,who offered the enemy mead to drink
00:49:44,00:49:45,and it was full of Mad Honey.
00:49:45,00:49:47,And what it does is it kind of knocks you out.
00:49:47,00:49:49,"Like if you take a strong hallucinogenic,"
00:49:49,00:49:50,"you just pass out, it's stupefied"
00:49:50,00:49:54,"and then they massacred 5,000 people, I think."
00:49:54,00:49:55,"And then again, Ivan the Great,"
00:49:55,00:49:58,"I think just left fat of spiked mead,"
00:49:58,00:50:00,spiked with Mad Honey in his own camp
00:50:00,00:50:02,and then he and his soldiers left.
00:50:02,00:50:04,"And yeah, the troops came and like you said Dan,"
00:50:04,00:50:07,"they came in and thought, oh, I wonder why this has been left here?"
00:50:07,00:50:08,Let's drink it all.
00:50:08,00:50:11,"And then drank it all, fell asleep and were massacred."
00:50:11,00:50:12,- Why can't they resist?
00:50:12,00:50:13,Don't they know?
00:50:13,00:50:15,"They're not Winnie the Pooh, they don't..."
00:50:15,00:50:16,- I know.
00:50:16,00:50:17,(laughing)
00:50:17,00:50:20,"- Honey, honey, Tommy."
00:50:20,00:50:23,"- I think Olga of Kiev, I might be wrong about this,"
00:50:23,00:50:27,but was she the one where they killed her husband
00:50:27,00:50:28,"and to get her own back,"
00:50:28,00:50:31,"she's kind of got her army to this town,"
00:50:31,00:50:33,forced them to all give her a pigeon
00:50:33,00:50:35,"and said, okay, give us a pigeon"
00:50:35,00:50:36,or I'm gonna do you in.
00:50:36,00:50:38,"And they went, okay, we'll give you a pigeon."
00:50:38,00:50:40,So everyone in the town gave her a pigeon
00:50:40,00:50:43,and then she tied some fire stuff
00:50:43,00:50:45,to the legs of the pigeons
00:50:45,00:50:46,and they're all homing pigeons.
00:50:46,00:50:49,So they all flew back and they burned the town down.
00:50:49,00:50:50,"- Oh, was that Olga?"
00:50:50,00:50:50,- I think so.
00:50:50,00:50:52,- She was full of wacky ideas.
00:50:52,00:50:53,She should have been employed by Disney
00:50:53,00:50:55,to build the haunted mansion.
00:50:55,00:50:57,- She was a dick dastardly of her day.
00:50:57,00:50:59,(laughing)
00:50:59,00:51:03,- Can I just quickly mention one last thing
00:51:03,00:51:04,"before we wrap up,"
00:51:04,00:51:08,which is that I discovered animals in war
00:51:08,00:51:10,and accusations of people using them for their benefit.
00:51:10,00:51:15,"In 2007, the British forces had to actively deny rumors"
00:51:15,00:51:18,that they had released a plague of ferocious badgers
00:51:18,00:51:19,into Basra.
00:51:19,00:51:20,(laughing)
00:51:20,00:51:21,- Really?
00:51:21,00:51:23,"- Yeah, Major Mike Shearer,"
00:51:23,00:51:25,"the UK military spokesperson,"
00:51:25,00:51:26,say we can categorically state
00:51:26,00:51:29,that we have not released man-eating badgers into the area.
00:51:29,00:51:33,And this had been claimed by a lot of the locals
00:51:33,00:51:35,that they had been seeing and killing
00:51:35,00:51:38,"these large, giant honey badgers."
00:51:38,00:51:39,And...
00:51:39,00:51:40,"- Oh, honey badgers."
00:51:40,00:51:43,- But it was not his trick when he was denying it.
00:51:43,00:51:46,"He was like, ""No, we haven't done any badgers here."""
00:51:46,00:51:47,No.
00:51:47,00:51:49,(upbeat music)
00:51:49,00:51:50,"- Okay, that's it."
00:51:50,00:51:51,That is all of our facts.
00:51:51,00:51:53,Thank you so much for listening.
