00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
 The following podcast contains comments that some listeners may find upsetting.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,780
 Specifically, people who are halfway through reading Anna Karenina and don't want to know what happens in the end.

3
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:34,380
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from four undisclosed locations in the UK.

4
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:40,000
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,220
 And once again, we have gathered round the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

6
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:48,520
 And in no particular order, here we go.

7
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,600
 Starting with you, Anna.

8
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,300
 My fact this week is that badgers change their bedding more often than I do.

9
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,700
 Wow.

10
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:03,580
 Specifically, I don't think this makes me gross because specifically badgers change their bedding every 10 days.

11
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:10,620
 Oh, you could have said they change it 15 times more often than you do, perhaps.

12
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,220
 Screw you, okay.

13
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,420
 They are very clean, unnecessarily clean, really.

14
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,060
 But yeah, they're amazingly assiduous with their bedding.

15
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,700
 They air it so they have lots of straw and grass and dried leaves and stuff that they sleep on.

16
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:29,500
 And every 10 days, they drag it out into the open and they pull it backwards.

17
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,980
 So they're walking backwards, pulling the bedding in their forepaws and they roll it along.

18
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:37,460
 And when they're far enough from the entrance, they kick it away with their back feet.

19
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:43,700
 And then they leave it out during the day to dry and air and get rid of the fleas and stuff that are on it.

20
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,340
 And then they drag it back in.

21
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,260
 Coincidentally, Anna, that is also exactly how you clean your bedding as well, isn't it?

22
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,060
 Yeah.

23
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,460
 Is this something you have in common?

24
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:55,780
 Sometimes they sleep on items such as crisp packets and other bits of rubbish.

25
00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:02,620
 There's nothing wine bottle in there, James.

26
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,500
 It's Tracy M in a badger.

27
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,100
 Is this what we're discovering?

28
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,100
 Pretty cool that they have bedding, generally.

29
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,660
 We've sort of skimmed over that.

30
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,780
 That's just quite sweet.

31
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,660
 I've never pictured many animals with sort of bedsheets and blankets.

32
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,300
 Really?

33
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,780
 OK, because you know when they say that an animal lives in a certain habitat,

34
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,540
 the habitat is the shop where they buy all their bedding from.

35
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:27,540
 The upmarket badges, yeah.

36
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,860
 But they do. I mean, if they were going to habitat, they do have items in their bedding

37
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:37,900
 that kind of feel upmarket like garlic skins, garlic pieces, so as to create an aroma.

38
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,900
 And it's useful for them.

39
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,300
 But I mean, that feels a bit habitat shop, doesn't it?

40
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,260
 It's really cool.

41
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,940
 I read the other day, and this is off topic, already off topic,

42
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:52,500
 but in Han Dynasty, China, they used to have a room where the concubines

43
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,540
 of the emperor lived and some of the emperors would put seshuan peppers

44
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,980
 in the paint or in the walls so that the room would be kind of tingly

45
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:05,900
 and peppery and stuff because, one, it was it kept it nice and warm.

46
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:10,140
 But then on the other hand, it was supposed to be like a fertility symbol

47
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,020
 because it's got lots of seeds.

48
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,460
 That sounds quite dangerous to me,

49
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:17,740
 because if you are in the sexy, spicy chili fertility room

50
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,700
 and you just happen to lean against the wall for a bit,

51
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,700
 let's say you put your hand on the wall

52
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,980
 and then later on you're taking out your contact lenses, whatever,

53
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,900
 then you suddenly got a red hot eye.

54
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,940
 That's a really good point.

55
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,620
 And also what happens in the sexy fertility room?

56
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,940
 People are naked.

57
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:34,420
 What do you not want to touch when you've got chilies on your fingers?

58
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,540
 I don't know. Even when I'm naked in a sexy room,

59
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,380
 I'm really rubbing my genitals against the wall.

60
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,660
 Actually, you're OK.

61
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,380
 It's a good way for the emperor, though, to find out

62
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,820
 who's been sneaking into his concubine room

63
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,980
 just by going everyone quickly rub your eyes

64
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,060
 and whoever starts freaking out.

65
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,980
 All right, mate, busted.

66
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,820
 Come here, eunuch number 30.

67
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:59,060
 Anyway, badges.

68
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,380
 Yeah, they should keep chili peppers in their in their sets

69
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,100
 because their main problem is flea infestation.

70
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,740
 Probably help help them with that, wouldn't it?

71
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,500
 But another clever thing they do with their bedding

72
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,660
 is they use it as radiators.

73
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,780
 So as well as sleeping on it, and this is especially in spring

74
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,860
 when they're having offspring, then they'll pull fresh vegetation

75
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,940
 as opposed to dried up leaves and grass and stuff.

76
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,780
 They'll put in bluebells and other fresh vegetation

77
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,020
 and they pull it into their set

78
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,460
 and then they pile it up in the corner of their bedroom.

79
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,100
 And as it decomposes, it emits loads of heat.

80
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,700
 And so in that pile, that pile can take the temperature

81
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,140
 from 18 degrees to 38 degrees.

82
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,020
 That's really clever.

83
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,860
 That's really clever, that's very cool.

84
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,300
 They travel far as well to get the materials, don't they?

85
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,540
 They sort of have a 100 meter radius

86
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,140
 that they like to go foraging for.

87
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:48,900
 They also, I believe, are the only other British mammal

88
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,100
 to build toilets, apart from humans.

89
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,380
 OK.

90
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:57,340
 So they dig their own latrine pits and they will use these pits

91
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,140
 more cleverly than humans use their toilets, I would say,

92
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:03,020
 because they use these as a communication device

93
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,900
 because once they do a poo, they will then spray it with ascent

94
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,540
 from their glands near the bottom to say who they are,

95
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,220
 what they're all about.

96
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,260
 Is the spray, is that sort of a freshening device?

97
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,060
 Like, and this is a strange, personal piece of information,

98
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,420
 but one of my housemates has installed in a lot of avatars

99
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:26,140
 thing called poo-pourri and insisted that all of us spray that

100
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:30,460
 before we're going to do a poo and it apparently mitigates the scent.

101
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,860
 Yeah, it has to be before and then you poo onto it.

102
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,020
 And I'm just wondering if the badges are doing a version of that.

103
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,740
 Well, so you spray, you spray the inside of the bowl as opposed to the room.

104
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:43,220
 Exactly. Yeah, yeah.

105
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:47,820
 And so I don't know, bad as you know, one badger is a real martinet.

106
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,460
 It was like, look, everyone stinks. Here's some spray.

107
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:54,180
 I wonder if you're really ahead of the curve and in a year's time

108
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,100
 we'll listen back to this podcast and go, wow, Anna was the first to do that.

109
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,540
 Or whether you're completely insane.

110
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,420
 I'm quite working out.

111
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,740
 It's been forced on me.

112
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,140
 It's like when we predicted Hamilton should be a musical before it happens.

113
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:12,860
 We did re-listen, guys.

114
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:16,860
 No, it's for it's for I'm so territory marking to keep enemies at bay.

115
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,260
 Right. Yeah.

116
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:22,220
 And also, I think like it tells your enemies how strong you are.

117
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:26,740
 So if you've done a really, really good poo and like there's some really

118
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:30,580
 good good smells with it, then it shows that you're really well fed

119
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,620
 and you're up for a fight.

120
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,740
 That's an element that UFC should bring in.

121
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,540
 If Conor McGregor just had a massive poo on the weighing scale.

122
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:39,220
 Come on.

123
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,220
 Snippin went on, this is going to be scary.

124
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,860
 And with scent marking, they also said mark each other.

125
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:50,300
 So they have these anal gland secretions and apparently they're the texture

126
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,820
 of margarine and very overpowering smell, according to pro badger watches.

127
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:58,180
 But they either do mutual marking, which is where they simultaneously

128
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,220
 sent mark each other, which is quite funny to watch.

129
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,300
 They rub their bums against each other.

130
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,260
 Or they do sequential marking.

131
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:07,380
 And what I read in one study about this is that that is like putting

132
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:10,980
 your own personal advertisement on another badger, treating that badger

133
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,860
 like a bus with your advert on it.

134
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,860
 So when you sent mark that badger, it's going around with your scent on it,

135
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,180
 advertising to loads of other badgers, excuse me, there's amazing scent.

136
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,060
 That's my mate Bodger.

137
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:28,180
 They've also, when this is the honey badger specifically,

138
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,820
 I think they're technically not badgers.

139
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,620
 Are they honey badgers?

140
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,460
 You're kidding.

141
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,460
 They're definitely very different.

142
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,380
 But we should say international listeners, sorry, that we are talking

143
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:40,620
 about the European badger mostly, which is which is a kind of weasel.

144
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,500
 We should we should also say it's in the weasel family.

145
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,900
 Oh, my God, basically all my research is on honey badgers here.

146
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:51,060
 Oh, honey badgers are amazing, but they deserve their own.

147
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,380
 Amazing. Yeah. Sorry, Dan.

148
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,940
 I've got another badger who wasn't a badger and that's Charlotte Badger.

149
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,180
 Do you want to hear about Charlotte Badger?

150
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,020
 She's a badger was the first Australian female pirates

151
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,980
 and the first European woman to live in New Zealand, probably.

152
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:09,780
 The probably bit is she definitely was one of the first couple.

153
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,700
 She was transported to Sydney for housebreaking.

154
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,260
 She was born in Worcestershire and then she was put on a boat to Tasmania

155
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:19,580
 and she started a rebellion and she took over the whole ship.

156
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,580
 OK, do you know about her?

157
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,580
 I've read about this boat, this huge women's rebellion on a ship.

158
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:27,140
 It's amazing. But the captain afterwards said, oh,

159
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,500
 yeah, you know, there was quite a lot of women involved,

160
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,660
 but you see the kind of one bloke over there.

161
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,420
 It was mostly him because if he'd admitted

162
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:38,180
 that all the women had taken over his boat, he would have gotten a load of trouble.

163
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,940
 So he was like, no, no, it's mostly the men.

164
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:43,180
 But it was basically the women took over it and they sailed to New Zealand

165
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:46,940
 and started living with the Maori's and then every now and then

166
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:51,380
 like missionaries would go over and see these women who were living in New Zealand.

167
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:55,060
 And eventually the Maori people kind of fell out with her

168
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,540
 because they'd heard that something had happened to some Maori people on her boat.

169
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:03,740
 As she ended up in Tonga and about another like dozen years later,

170
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,700
 there were some missionaries going to Tonga, going, oh, yeah, there's that woman again.

171
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,260
 So yeah, how did she get here?

172
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,260
 Yeah. But anyway, she's called.

173
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,220
 I know Dan said Badger's travelled a long way,

174
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,460
 getting a hundred yards to the end of their territory.

175
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:18,500
 But that must be the furthest travelled badger is far.

176
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,340
 I've got another human badger. Oh, great. Oh, OK.

177
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,620
 It's a guy. He's not he's not a real badger.

178
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,540
 He is a human and he's called Charles Foster.

179
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:31,380
 He wrote a book called Being a Beast and the idea was he's a British guy

180
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,460
 who wanted to reconnect with nature and he thought the best way to do that

181
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:38,020
 was to go and live as animals and live the way that they live.

182
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,260
 So Badgers was one of the things that he did.

183
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,140
 And he roped his kids into doing it with him.

184
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,740
 So he lived for a while as a badger.

185
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:48,220
 They went out into the forest and they built a big hole in the ground,

186
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,180
 which was their sleeping quarters, their set.

187
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:54,180
 They were eating worms because that would be something that Badgers would eat.

188
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,700
 They were sleeping in the daytime and foraging at night.

189
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,620
 So they lived for a good long time, a few weeks as these badgers.

190
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,020
 And it wasn't the only animals that he did.

191
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,060
 He did an otter as well.

192
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,700
 He lived as an otter with his kids.

193
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:12,180
 The reason I mentioned that is he also did that scat sniffing that the poo smelling.

194
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,940
 So basically, no. Yeah.

195
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,260
 So by the end of that experience,

196
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:21,500
 him and his kids were each able to identify whose poo that was out of the family members.

197
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,460
 A lot of people are listening to this.

198
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,340
 They're really struggling to educate their children at home.

199
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:31,380
 I think a lot of light bulbs have gone over a lot of heads here going,

200
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,820
 that is a great idea.

201
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,620
 And it'll change your sheets more often.

202
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,780
 Yes. So multi perfect.

203
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,380
 Why do you bring us these lunatics?

204
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:43,340
 I did think I did meet another guy who did that

205
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,300
 called Thomas Thwaites, who lived as a goat.

206
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,780
 I don't know if we talked about him before, but that's right.

207
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,340
 Yeah, he was awesome. Yeah.

208
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:54,700
 Honey badgers.

209
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,900
 Have you heard?

210
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,260
 They've got badgers in the name.

211
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,540
 Not having it. No.

212
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,380
 Have you heard of the badger?

213
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:05,860
 Which I can't believe this is last year's big badger for me on.

214
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,620
 And I don't know what we were all doing in February,

215
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:11,340
 because this was way more important on the 9th of February, 2020.

216
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:14,980
 A badger fell through the ceiling of the Northampton branch of superdrug.

217
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:19,100
 OK. Can you imagine how terrifying that would be?

218
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,180
 Like it's scary enough when a spider starts coming down from the ceiling.

219
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:25,300
 Yeah. A badger just fell through the roof.

220
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:29,500
 And it ran under the perfume counter, probably looking for some nice scents.

221
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:36,140
 And anyway, I mention it partly because it got its own blue plaque in November.

222
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:39,500
 Jesus, we have lower the blue plaque bar.

223
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:45,740
 Do you remember last week, I think it was, we were talking about Dolly Parton.

224
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,980
 Yeah. And what had she done?

225
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,740
 The Moderna, she'd she'd provided money for it.

226
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,860
 Provided money for a vaccine.

227
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,740
 Well, another person who's provided money for a vaccine is Brian May,

228
00:11:54,740 --> 00:12:00,020
 who has given 50,000 pounds of his own money for a vaccine for badgers.

229
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,700
 Which. Wow.

230
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:08,540
 And this is because basically people blame badgers for spreading TB

231
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,780
 and they want to call them every year.

232
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:15,180
 And they think one way of not calling them is to vaccinate them against TB.

233
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,740
 So they won't, if indeed they do spread it, they won't do it anymore.

234
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,620
 I was wondering who would be the first to breach the thorny

235
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:25,340
 subject of TB and culls and bovine awfulness.

236
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,340
 And James, you had guts to do it because now we're going to get lettuce.

237
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:31,220
 Oh, no, Dan, honey badgers.

238
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:34,700
 Thank God. So honey badgers skin so thick

239
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,660
 you can hit them with machetes and they probably won't die.

240
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,860
 The only way to kill them is with a bullet through the skull.

241
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,660
 That's honestly what they say.

242
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,340
 What they say.

243
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:48,460
 I just say, I went to honey badgers to try and get us away from killing badgers.

244
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:58,020
 I read an essay on European badger sexing and it's very hard to do

245
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,020
 because there's actually not too much difference between them.

246
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:04,100
 And they basically it ends up by saying in the words of the Devon badger group,

247
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,460
 the only way to be sure is to roll it over.

248
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,540
 And then what?

249
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,100
 And then you could have seen the vagina.

250
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:14,060
 I think I imagine like a lot of bubbles.

251
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,060
 You kind of turn it over and it's got either a penis or a vagina.

252
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:22,060
 And then which is which is it?

253
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,060
 It's not a sneaky swap seat.

254
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,940
 No, no, they're very tread.

255
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:26,420
 Got it.

256
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:29,860
 One of the only times we've mentioned badgers before I checked was when James,

257
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:35,780
 you said that the best way to prepare badger meat is to let running water over it

258
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,380
 for several days.

259
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:41,220
 So it is illegal to kill a badger unless you're part of a government mandated

260
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,140
 cull and you're out shooting it with a rifle.

261
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:47,180
 But if a badger dies on the road, you are allowed to eat it.

262
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:51,780
 And in 2012, the Guardian interviewed a man called Arthur Boyd,

263
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,420
 who was I think it was in his seventies or eighties.

264
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,460
 But he said he'd been eating badger for 55 years.

265
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:02,380
 And he lived in the countryside and the Guardian sent someone to interview him

266
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:05,980
 and to try eating badger just before the Guardian spoke to him.

267
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,620
 He'd had a bit of stewed badger with badger genitals on the side.

268
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,260
 Which genitals was that?

269
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:17,540
 I think it must have been male genitals, badger nages.

270
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:23,100
 But he said that sometimes you don't have to run it under water

271
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,540
 and that you do have to run it under your car.

272
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:30,420
 But this is the thing, his wife is a vegetarian.

273
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:34,260
 Well, I'm not fucking surprised.

274
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,940
 The other option is eating badger bollocks every day.

275
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:42,660
 I suppose if it's ethical eating, isn't it?

276
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,380
 If it's died of natural causes,

277
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:47,500
 it's one step away from vegetarianism, eating badger carcass.

278
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,100
 It's a one step, but it's a fucking long step.

279
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,500
 It's one giant leap.

280
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,500
 Weird step.

281
00:14:54,500 --> 00:15:02,660
 OK, it is time for fact number two,

282
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,060
 and that is Andy.

283
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:08,900
 My fact is that the chief designer of America's first stealth bomber

284
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:12,300
 also helped to design the Dumbo ride at Disneyland.

285
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,980
 Amazing. Very cool.

286
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,580
 That's awesome.

287
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:19,420
 Yeah, so this is from a new book that's called Stealth,

288
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:22,100
 The Secret Contest to Invent Invisible Aircraft.

289
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,420
 So it wasn't a book about Dumbo rides that you were reading?

290
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:29,460
 No, I do have a big book about Disney, actually, but I haven't read it yet.

291
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,580
 It feels like this would have been the moment to read it.

292
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:39,220
 Just use it in my honey badger section next week.

293
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:44,700
 But this was a guy called Richard Sherer,

294
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:49,660
 who he was working in the 40s and 50s for Ames.

295
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,820
 He was, you know, an engineer and a designer,

296
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:55,540
 and he worked for a lab run by the National Advisory Committee

297
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,980
 for Aeronautics, which was the kind of precursor to NASA.

298
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:01,060
 But in his spare time, he was hanging around with some buddies

299
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,820
 who ran a firm called the Arrow Development Company,

300
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:07,380
 and they made merry-go-rounds and things, and they did lots of engineering, too.

301
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,220
 And eventually they got a Disney contract.

302
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:13,580
 So he, Sherer, moon-lighted from his day job,

303
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:17,460
 which was building serious weaponry and designing systems for this kind of stuff.

304
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:20,140
 He kept getting these phone calls at work,

305
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,860
 which were from the guys at Disneyland saying,

306
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,780
 we need you to sort out the brakes and the rails on Dumbo and all these other rides.

307
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,900
 Yeah, so he not only did Dumbo, he did the Tea Party ride.

308
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,420
 He did the Matterhorn, which is a giant mountain.

309
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,380
 I mean, it's absolutely humongous.

310
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:37,220
 The little train that could, flying saucer's rides as well.

311
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,820
 Like, he's got a big footprint on the design of that place. Yeah.

312
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:44,700
 And did he ever confuse his two jobs and accidentally in war,

313
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,460
 you could see tea cups looming over the horizon?

314
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:53,220
 Harry S. Truman refused to ride Dumbo at Disneyland.

315
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:57,980
 Really? Because the elephant is the mascot of the Republican Party.

316
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:01,540
 So he said, I'm not getting on an elephant.

317
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:06,500
 And basically, I mean, it was just a joke, but it's a thing that happened.

318
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:13,140
 So there are big links between Disney and defense tech, which is bizarre.

319
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,860
 So Disney, for example,

320
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:19,100
 there are robot animatronics in the first Disneyland,

321
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,980
 you know, little robots moving back and forth, that kind of thing.

322
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,380
 They were controlled by a magnetic tape system,

323
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:27,940
 which was originally developed for the Polaris submarine missile

324
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:31,940
 and Disney licensed the patent to use it in their park.

325
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,540
 So I know, really weird.

326
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:38,580
 Well, he got he got the idea from Tivoli in Copenhagen, didn't he?

327
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:42,020
 Which is a couple of us definitely went to that when we were on tour last year,

328
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:46,020
 which is a beautiful fairground in the center of Copenhagen.

329
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,860
 And that was his dream. I want that in America.

330
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:53,420
 And he was very good at doing research, sort of personal research,

331
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:56,500
 so far as I could tell, for how his park should operate.

332
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,180
 So he used to walk after people in parks

333
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,300
 and just notice how often they would litter.

334
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,820
 This is this is the story that I read.

335
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:08,620
 Possibly he had researchers doing it, but supposedly Disney would walk around

336
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:12,340
 and we go, OK, this is the distance that it usually would take for someone to litter.

337
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,940
 That's how far apart we need our bins to be

338
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,700
 so that people don't do it in our park.

339
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:22,660
 Yeah. So he was very much part of the integral kind of feel of all the

340
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:27,140
 he was reported to the police for stalking on multiple occasions, wasn't he?

341
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,580
 You might drop litter because you're trying to create a distraction

342
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,860
 from the man who's been following you around the park for the last hour.

343
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:37,460
 So I can't believe we've never mentioned this system, the utilidor system.

344
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:41,620
 It's short for utility corridors and it's part of the backstage area.

345
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,900
 So this is another stealth feature of Disneyland.

346
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:49,660
 And it was because they're they're so strict at Disney

347
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,260
 with maintaining the fiction that all the staff are characters.

348
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:55,340
 So all the staff are called actors and they're on stage when they're in front

349
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,860
 of the public and backstage is when they're not in front of the public.

350
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:01,740
 And you can never see them travelling to their destinations

351
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,140
 and you can never see them taking out the rubbish, for instance.

352
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,860
 And you're never supposed to see someone crossing the wrong kingdom.

353
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:10,140
 So you should never see Dumbo crossing the Mickey Mouse kingdom

354
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,980
 or wherever it's range.

355
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,420
 It feels like it feels like a gang system.

356
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:19,820
 That's why they have all the weapons of war.

357
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,220
 So what they have is, and especially under the Magic Kingdom,

358
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:28,100
 is a system of underground tunnels and that's for the staff to get to certain places.

359
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,540
 And so I think it's the largest wardrobe department on earth,

360
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,140
 because it's where they also keep all the costumes.

361
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,780
 And it's one of the world's largest utility tunnels.

362
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,660
 And so if you have to sprint to a destination as a member of staff,

363
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:42,420
 you have to go underground or, in fact, weirdly at the Magic Kingdom,

364
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:45,860
 it's on ground level and then the whole kingdom is built above it on top.

365
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:48,900
 Oh, really? Yeah, that is insane.

366
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,900
 It's weird, isn't it?

367
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:54,460
 Also, the staff have a really odd rule about names there as well.

368
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:58,660
 So there was a tradition that rumor has it started with Walt Disney himself,

369
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,500
 which is he never wanted to be called Mr. Disney.

370
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,540
 He was Walt. If you met him, hey, Walt.

371
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,020
 And so first names is a thing.

372
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:09,700
 However, there is a rule that if, say, they have an Andrew already, Andy,

373
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,380
 you were working there, and I arrived and I was called Andrew,

374
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:15,700
 I have to change my name because we can't have two Andrews.

375
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,820
 Why don't we do that in our office since James Rosson arrived

376
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:22,340
 and forever getting his emails.

377
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,740
 If he was called Derek, there'd be no problem.

378
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,580
 Yeah, exactly. Well, yeah.

379
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:30,180
 So Disney is your best place to go and work, James, because if you get in,

380
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,700
 it's like there's not going to be another James there.

381
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,340
 Come on. Sorry, Derek.

382
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:40,860
 I mean, they have quite a lot of that they're called actors,

383
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,060
 but quite a lot of actors now.

384
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,020
 Sure, have they reached really obscure names?

385
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:46,380
 Are you saying Engelburts and Pompadon?

386
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,700
 Weird, isn't it? Yeah.

387
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,500
 Yeah, I'm guessing it must be specific.

388
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,500
 Like there must be subcategory offices right within there.

389
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,060
 It must be like you're part of the rides.

390
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,300
 You're part of the janitorial staff.

391
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,300
 You're part of the creepy following people.

392
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,220
 See how much they put rubbish on the ground stuff, you know, that kind of thing.

393
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,780
 I have to say, Dan, it feels like a less good system

394
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,740
 than the system we have, which is surnames.

395
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:12,700
 Did you know that this is a problem?

396
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:16,220
 Which is that Disney has a haunted mansion ride.

397
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,660
 You know, lots of the Disney's have a haunted mansion, don't they?

398
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,180
 Because there are theme parks all over the world.

399
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:23,060
 But this is the California one, the original.

400
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:27,140
 Every so often, the staff discover a pile of mysterious powder

401
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:31,940
 on the floor of the haunted mansion, and it is said that this is...

402
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:32,940
 All the staff take a cane.

403
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,700
 It is said.

404
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:39,900
 But it's not as legally watertight as you think it is, James.

405
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:44,220
 It's said that it's people leaving their loved ones ashes on the floor.

406
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,740
 Oh, well, so this is because people love the haunted mansion

407
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,820
 and they love to go on the ride and it's great.

408
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:54,100
 Now, this has been furiously denied by Disney, we should say.

409
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,420
 I found a guy who's called Rob Doughty.

410
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,140
 He's the spokesman.

411
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,460
 He seems to spend about half his professional life

412
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,380
 just denying that there are parts of ash in the haunted mansion.

413
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,820
 And they interviewed a member of staff who said,

414
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,580
 "All these people that think their loved ones

415
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,380
 are going to be in the haunted mansion forever,

416
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,740
 while grandma's getting vacuumed up into a vacuum

417
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,100
 and getting sent out to the landfill somewhere."

418
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:16,820
 Wow. Where is this haunted landfill that I could go and visit?

419
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:24,660
 There was a big, big controversy at the start of the haunted mansion design

420
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,900
 over whether it should be funny or scary.

421
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,060
 There were proper arguments between the designers

422
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,420
 and they were called the Imagineers.

423
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,660
 There were nine of them.

424
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,260
 And there's one left who's called Rolly Crump,

425
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,420
 which is just such a strong name.

426
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,980
 He got there last after everyone else,

427
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,420
 after all the names had been taken.

428
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:43,220
 I mean, neither of those is a name, but OK, I'll take it.

429
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:48,140
 But he was, his ideas were all sort of too mad for the ride.

430
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,460
 So there was supposed to be this museum of the weird

431
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,380
 to house all of his crazy ideas.

432
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,860
 But anyway, one of the things that he recounted doing at the time

433
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,900
 was he recounted the fact that they, the designers,

434
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:02,620
 also had to clean the haunted mansion every night instead of cleaners,

435
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,780
 because cleaners refused to clean it.

436
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:07,980
 And the reason was, to be fair, they only had themselves to blame.

437
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,220
 The reason was that the cleaners said,

438
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,300
 "Do you mind leaving the lights on when you leave?"

439
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,020
 Because it's a bit scary, all these animatronics

440
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,380
 and these crazy ghost sounds and these horrible figures.

441
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,780
 So can you just leave the lights on for us to clean it overnight?

442
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:21,780
 And so what Rolly and pals did was they complied,

443
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,620
 but then they installed motion sensors

444
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,980
 that at some moments would extinguish all the lights

445
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,660
 and turn on all the ghost effects in the animatronics.

446
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:31,460
 That's amazing.

447
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,460
 He said the next morning they went in

448
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,140
 and the ghost effects were still running.

449
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,260
 There was a broom lying in the centre of the floor

450
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,140
 and they got a call from personnel saying the janitors would not be returning.

451
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:43,900
 Wow.

452
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,940
 Disneyland also has stealthily placed all around

453
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,780
 what they call smelletizers.

454
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,380
 And the idea is that they emit a certain smell

455
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,660
 so that everything feels fresh wherever you're going.

456
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:56,060
 So if you pass something that looks like a baking shop,

457
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,940
 they'll have the smell of fresh bread being pumped out

458
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,060
 from the side of the building.

459
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,500
 It's basically poop-a-ree.

460
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:06,300
 No one's pooing on the walls in Disneyland.

461
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,300
 You get removed pretty swiftly.

462
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,500
 Ah, you can be removed for lots of stuff.

463
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,220
 They've just banned loose ice.

464
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,820
 What's loose ice?

465
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,980
 Just ice that's loose in a...

466
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:22,580
 I thought it was like a really cool street slang

467
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,180
 for some new drug that I'd never heard of.

468
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:27,060
 No, it's literally frozen water.

469
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,020
 You can't turn up with a cup of ice and get over there.

470
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:32,500
 Have you guys heard of Jeff Wright's, R-E-I-T-Z?

471
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:36,660
 His Twitter account was @Disney366

472
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:40,460
 and it said, "I have been to Disneyland every day

473
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,500
 since January the 1st, 2012."

474
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:47,020
 He was an honorary Disneyland citizen and an honorary mouseketeer.

475
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:50,420
 And basically, he and his friends joked

476
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:53,980
 that Disney had this advertising campaign

477
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,900
 during the leap year of 2012,

478
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:00,100
 saying, "You can go to Disney one more day this year."

479
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,340
 And then him and his friends are like,

480
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,220
 "Well, you only get to go one more day

481
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:07,020
 if you go literally for all the other 365 days."

482
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:10,420
 And they went, "Wait a minute, we're unemployed.

483
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:13,900
 Why don't we just go to Disneyland every day for a year?"

484
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,420
 And so from January the 1st, 2012,

485
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:20,860
 Jeff Wright's and a friend went to Disneyland every single day

486
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:23,060
 and his friend eventually kind of gave up,

487
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,380
 but he carried on.

488
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:28,060
 And he carried on all the way until March 2020,

489
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:32,940
 a 2,995-day streak of going to Disneyland

490
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,500
 until it closed due to COVID.

491
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,660
 - Oh, wow. - He just left them in there

492
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,980
 on his own. - He should have done.

493
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:42,420
 And they said, "Are you going to go back when it reopens?"

494
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,900
 And he's like, "No, it was a streak.

495
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,380
 It was like an everyday thing.

496
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,740
 And now that I've missed it every day,

497
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,340
 I'm just going to stop going."

498
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,860
 - That would make it pointless.

499
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:52,460
 (laughing)

500
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,420
 - He really enjoyed it.

501
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,980
 He said, "Someone said to him,

502
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,540
 "Will you ever get sick of Disneyland?"

503
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:59,180
 He says, "No, I don't think I will get sick of Disneyland

504
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,820
 because I like to change things up

505
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:04,020
 and do different things each time."

506
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:04,860
 - Wow. - I like him.

507
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,740
 I like this guy.

508
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,540
 - The training to work at Disneyland

509
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:10,140
 is called the traditions.

510
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:13,020
 And it sounds, people seem to be okay with it.

511
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:13,860
 It's like a cult.

512
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,900
 So it's done repeatedly.

513
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,460
 I was reading an interview with one employee

514
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:18,140
 who was saying that every so often,

515
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:20,620
 you'll be walking around in your costume

516
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,780
 and someone will walk up to you and give you a card

517
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,980
 that summons you to the magic kingdom

518
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,100
 for more sort of happiness training.

519
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:30,020
 And said, "That's all to seem happy."

520
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,900
 It's called emotional regulation training.

521
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,220
 And the idea is that you have to stay in character

522
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,100
 whatever happens.

523
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,220
 So for instance, I was listening to some people

524
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,620
 who went to go on the new Star Wars ride

525
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:42,340
 and the ride broke and customers were furious

526
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,820
 'cause they'd been queuing for days.

527
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,540
 And there were thousands of people on this app

528
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,380
 trying to get on.

529
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,740
 They were so excited about it.

530
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,740
 So they went and complained to one of the actors

531
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,460
 who remained in character.

532
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,700
 So kept on saying,

533
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,580
 "Well, I'm afraid that's Kylo Ren's fault."

534
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,900
 He's the bad guy in Star Wars, apparently.

535
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,820
 You better talk to Kylo Ren about that.

536
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,780
 Sounds like they're dastardly dealing

537
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,900
 and people screaming and swearing and crying.

538
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,260
 - Let me get my line manager.

539
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,100
 This is Donald.

540
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,340
 (laughing)

541
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,920
 (upbeat music)

542
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:17,620
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three.

543
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,820
 And that is my fact.

544
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:21,300
 My fact this week is that whenever Stephen King

545
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:24,220
 couldn't find the audio book of something he wanted to read,

546
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,540
 he would put one of his three children into a room

547
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,620
 with a tape recorder

548
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:31,220
 and would get them to read out the whole thing for him.

549
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,460
 - Wow.

550
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,300
 - Yeah.

551
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,140
 - So he is a sadist.

552
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,260
 'Cause you do wonder if he's a sadist when you read his books

553
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,900
 and it turns out he is.

554
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,900
 That is cruel.

555
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:39,740
 - I love him.

556
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:40,980
 - I think he's amazing.

557
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,580
 He's a big, big, big reader.

558
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,060
 I mean, Stephen King, basically,

559
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,780
 if you ever hear him talk, talks about books.

560
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:49,060
 He loves reading books and he lives in Maine, in Bangor, Maine.

561
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,380
 And there's a lot of roads.

562
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,580
 He does a lot of driving.

563
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:54,180
 And he hates the idea that he's wasting time

564
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,620
 while he's behind the wheel, not reading books.

565
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,660
 So audio books was a massive thing for him.

566
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:01,860
 And back in the 80s, obviously, prior to the internet,

567
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,300
 it was very hard to get your hands on audio books.

568
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,980
 And so if he was unable to do that in the 80s,

569
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:10,100
 one of his three kids would be shoved into a room

570
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,420
 with this little recorder.

571
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,380
 And they would have to sit there and read out the whole thing.

572
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,820
 And they were reading stuff

573
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,820
 that was definitely not appropriate for their age.

574
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,380
 So his daughter, Naomi, when she was 12,

575
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,180
 had to read a book called Raven,

576
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:23,300
 which was the definitive journalistic account

577
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,980
 of the Jonestown Massacre.

578
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:28,660
 She also had to read Anna Karenina for him.

579
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:31,300
 - Oh, what happens in the end of that, Anna Karenina?

580
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,140
 Did anyone remember?

581
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:32,980
 - I believe, James.

582
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,500
 I think she gets hit by a train.

583
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,780
 I've only seen the Disney version

584
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,260
 where she gets hit by a ride.

585
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,500
 (all laughing)

586
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,740
 - Well, we've really leaned into

587
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:44,180
 spoilering this in a long-term sense.

588
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,500
 - I feel really bad about it now.

589
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,180
 - I feel like, because we've already

590
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,580
 spoilered Anna Karenina,

591
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:51,500
 that we can get away with spoilering it again and again.

592
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,340
 - You're right, yeah.

593
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:54,100
 - I think, and we don't spoiler anything else,

594
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,740
 we'll just spoil her Anna Karenina.

595
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,580
 - And it's one of the famous--

596
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,540
 - I think at the end of every show, we should close with,

597
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,700
 we'll be back again next week

598
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,540
 and Anna Karenina gets hit by a train.

599
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,620
 See ya, goodbye.

600
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,020
 (all laughing)

601
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,020
 - I still don't feel okay about this,

602
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,380
 and I'm signing out of the plan.

603
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,180
 But I do wanna hear a 12-year-old girl

604
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,980
 attempt to pronounce all the Russian names

605
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:14,020
 in Anna Karenina, please.

606
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,260
 - But the kids have become really,

607
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,900
 they are now writers, aren't they?

608
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,140
 Or a lot of them are now writers.

609
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,260
 I think he's got a few kids.

610
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,100
 - Two or three.

611
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,340
 - Joe Hill is one of them, is it, right?

612
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,180
 - Yeah, yeah, exactly.

613
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,500
 - Joe Hill, who's one of my favorite writers, by the way.

614
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,660
 I've read four of his books.

615
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,140
 I love him, he's awesome.

616
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,220
 - But the kids are now so into it

617
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,660
 that when they were dating,

618
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,980
 Owen King is one of the King children,

619
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,740
 and his wife, they swapped manuscripts

620
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,820
 to make sure they didn't hate each other's writing style

621
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,740
 before the relationship got too serious.

622
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,580
 (all laughing)

623
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:42,180
 I think it's really sweet.

624
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,260
 - Wow.

625
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,100
 - Yeah.

626
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:44,940
 - But yeah, he did, I mean,

627
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,900
 they did sort of breed good writers out of them

628
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,900
 via having them read these great works of literature.

629
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,580
 They also used to, at bedtime,

630
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:54,580
 the kids would tell them, Tabitha and Stephen,

631
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:57,140
 bedtime stories, as opposed to the other way round.

632
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,380
 They used to sit around the dinner table

633
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,620
 and pass around the latest book

634
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:00,740
 that they were reading as a family.

635
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,620
 So say it was The Hobbit or Narnia,

636
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,660
 and they would all take turns reading passages

637
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:05,860
 around the table.

638
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:08,500
 I mean, as someone, well, we all love books.

639
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,820
 I think that sounds really cool.

640
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,020
 I might do it with my kids.

641
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:11,860
 - Yeah.

642
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,540
 I couldn't believe about Stephen King,

643
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,380
 and maybe this is just because

644
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,140
 I cannot work to any noise at all.

645
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:19,340
 He listens to loud rock music while he's writing.

646
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:22,300
 - Well, I listen to really loud J-pop music

647
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,380
 when I'm writing.

648
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,220
 - Do you?

649
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,420
 - But the difference there is,

650
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:28,820
 and the distraction is English versus Japanese lyrics.

651
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:32,260
 So your mind gets taken away with English lyrics,

652
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,820
 which I find the Stephen King thing so hard to believe.

653
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:37,620
 Whereas, yeah, I listen to Andrea Bocelli, for example,

654
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,620
 when I'm writing.

655
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,780
 - But I wonder if because it's loud rock music,

656
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:43,660
 sometimes you don't hear the lyrics quite as easily, right?

657
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,740
 - Yeah, yeah.

658
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,580
 - Yeah?

659
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,900
 He does say it sometimes affects his word choice,

660
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:50,420
 but it's never his style, so.

661
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,740
 - Maybe all this time he's been trying

662
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:55,260
 to write like really nice children's books, but.

663
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,860
 - Jane Austen only wrote romances

664
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:02,220
 because the music available at the time was romantic.

665
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:06,540
 If she'd had access to the Battle of Los Angeles,

666
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,500
 it would have been a very different career.

667
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,820
 - Yeah, so just a super quick background on Stephen King,

668
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:13,060
 obviously one of the most prolific living authors

669
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:16,500
 that we have, he's sold over 350 million copies

670
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,860
 of his books since he first debuted, Carrie.

671
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:24,860
 And he is someone who also has had probably more adaptations

672
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,620
 of his books into movies than any other living author.

673
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,700
 - One thing I really liked about him that I learned,

674
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,940
 if you go on stephenking.com, he has a page of dollar babies.

675
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,300
 These are really cool.

676
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,940
 So these are stories that he's written,

677
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,300
 which are not under contract for movies.

678
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:41,340
 So if you're like a young movie maker,

679
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:44,700
 then you can buy them off him for like just $1 or something,

680
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:48,300
 and then he'll let you make that story.

681
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:51,340
 So if you want to make a story such as

682
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:54,820
 "The Man Who Loved Flowers", that's one of them.

683
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:57,940
 "The Man Who Would Not Shake Hands",

684
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:00,620
 that's all of us actually at the moment.

685
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,820
 And another one is called "That Feeling".

686
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,660
 You can only say what it is in French.

687
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:08,500
 I don't know what the story's about, but that's the title.

688
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,980
 I suppose the story is...

689
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:15,300
 - Yeah, so it's really cool.

690
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,620
 I was reading up a bit on his house

691
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,660
 and just the contents of it.

692
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,900
 So yeah, he has a shelf of original audio books

693
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:20,740
 from his kids.

694
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:21,860
 He's got the dollar babies shelf

695
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,220
 where he keeps all of the movies

696
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,980
 that have been made off his short stories.

697
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,660
 One thing I really like is that

698
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:29,220
 he's been very active in the community in Bangor

699
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,660
 with helping to fund the community

700
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:34,300
 to have, for example, a baseball stadium

701
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:37,460
 that was built proper size, really good in functioning.

702
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,500
 And so he's really active in that community.

703
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,980
 But one of the things that he insisted

704
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:45,260
 with the baseball stadium is that the positioning

705
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:48,300
 of the scoreboard had to be placed

706
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,260
 at such a position on the stadium

707
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,940
 that he could see it from his window as he was writing.

708
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:55,140
 I read that and I can't find out

709
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,580
 whether that's definitely true or not.

710
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:59,500
 He definitely paid for the stadium, that's for sure.

711
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,780
 But do you think he did that?

712
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,900
 That's amazing, if so.

713
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,340
 - That's really funny.

714
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:05,420
 - It feels like a thing that he would do, but I agree.

715
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,260
 He's also so shrouded in myth

716
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:10,100
 because he's this horror character

717
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:14,140
 that people think is a Frankenstein-like character himself

718
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:17,140
 that he sort of walks around and weird things happen.

719
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,860
 He once stayed the night at John Grisham's house.

720
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,340
 They're very good friends, those two authors,

721
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,740
 and they had the same agent.

722
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:25,060
 And John Grisham's wife was so petrified

723
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,340
 that Stephen King was in the house

724
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,420
 that she was furious that John Grisham went to sleep.

725
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,140
 She's like, "What are you doing going to sleep?"

726
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,580
 And then he said, "Out of nowhere,

727
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:35,100
 their alarm system at 12 a.m. just beeped a color.

728
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,420
 It's never beeped before."

729
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,860
 And she was like, "I told you."

730
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,140
 And they got really scared.

731
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:42,060
 Then they heard this crazy growl.

732
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:42,900
 And they were like, "What is that?"

733
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,380
 And they ran downstairs and two cats, they don't have cats,

734
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,620
 were fighting right outside their window

735
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,620
 and having this massive bloodbath of a thigh.

736
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:52,500
 So she sat up the whole night in the loud room,

737
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,900
 freaked out, and as soon as they got boarded,

738
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,140
 she woke John Grisham up and went,

739
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,100
 "Get that man out of my house now."

740
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,420
 - Oh my God.

741
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,740
 It's not his fault cats are fighting outside his house.

742
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,060
 - No, no way.

743
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:04,900
 - It's similar to when E.L. James came around to my house

744
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,260
 and then there were a load of foxes

745
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,980
 having sex outside my house all night.

746
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,180
 I was like, "Get that woman out of my house."

747
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:14,740
 - Something quite creepy he did in Australia

748
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:17,780
 was it was in Alice Springs,

749
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:21,220
 and he was in Dimmock's bookshop in Australia.

750
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:24,700
 And he basically, the alarm was raised.

751
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,580
 Another alarm, he's got a history of alarms

752
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,820
 because one of the other customers noticed

753
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:31,660
 a strange man sort of fiddling around with the books

754
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:33,900
 and graffitiing in them and then leaving.

755
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,380
 So alerted the manager.

756
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,380
 And the manager went over to the books and checked

757
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,100
 and saw that they were Stephen King's books.

758
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,140
 And in fact, they were Stephen King's autographs

759
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,220
 inside the books.

760
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:44,660
 So they went out with the shop to look for him.

761
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,820
 And he was across the road in a grocery shop,

762
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,660
 buying some groceries.

763
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:49,300
 - That is an anti-climactic ending

764
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,580
 to this spooky story, Anna.

765
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,540
 Dan's had a lot more, you know,

766
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,500
 pizzazz in it than John Gresham thing.

767
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,500
 Didn't end with him buying some cool sets.

768
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,620
 - I'm no Stephen King.

769
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:05,340
 - There's another link between King and Tolstoy,

770
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:08,380
 apart from the fact that King made his daughter read

771
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,540
 Anna Karenina on audiobook,

772
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:13,380
 which is that Tolstoy's grandmother

773
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:18,380
 owned a surf who was blind, who was a human audiobook.

774
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,580
 - What?

775
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,540
 - Yeah, his name was Lev Stepanich.

776
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,540
 He was a professional storyteller.

777
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:28,740
 And Tolstoy remembered as a boy,

778
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:31,460
 he would go to his granny's bedroom.

779
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,980
 Lev Stepanich was there.

780
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,220
 He was sitting in the window sill,

781
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,300
 waiting for her to arrive.

782
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,180
 She would undress in front of him because he was blind.

783
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,620
 So there was no risk of impropriety.

784
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,660
 And then Tolstoy would be tucked up in bed

785
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,060
 next to his granny and Lev Stepanich

786
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,260
 would read them a story.

787
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,180
 - Well, that's really cool.

788
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:49,220
 His name sounds a bit like Led Zeppelin as well,

789
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:52,340
 which is what distracted me at the very start.

790
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:58,780
 - How was the blind man reading a story?

791
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,780
 You would have thought the audiobook is useful

792
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:03,020
 to be read to the person who is blind,

793
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,460
 which in fact, what's the subsequent use?

794
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,420
 But he-

795
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,260
 - He memorized it?

796
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,100
 - Presumably it's coming from,

797
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:07,940
 he's reading it from his own head.

798
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:11,300
 - He's memorized the story, I guess, Anna, yeah.

799
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,140
 - Cool.

800
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,940
 - But you're right about the early audiobooks.

801
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:16,100
 They did come because was it a lot of people

802
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,860
 who've been blinded in the war or something?

803
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:18,860
 They became useful?

804
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:19,700
 - Yeah, I think so.

805
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:23,100
 Some Americans were blinded in World War I.

806
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,420
 And I think a guy called Ian Fraser set up a team

807
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:28,260
 to make audiobooks because he loved reading

808
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,820
 and couldn't do it anymore

809
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,660
 and experimented with lots of different machines.

810
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,260
 And one of these machines apparently,

811
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,300
 according to the RNIB,

812
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,140
 the Royal National Institute for the Blind

813
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:41,100
 said that it turned letters into musical notes

814
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:44,540
 as a possible way of creating audiobooks for the blind.

815
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,500
 - Which, to me, I don't know how that would work.

816
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,900
 Do you have to distinguish between all musical notes

817
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:49,740
 and then make them correct?

818
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,380
 - You only need 26 notes.

819
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,420
 So you just go-

820
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,020
 - That's more than we have, really.

821
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,580
 - That's a good point.

822
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,300
 - You could go up an octave, can't you?

823
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,820
 - Yeah, you've got, that's what, three octaves in a bit.

824
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:05,260
 So you just go, you know, A, and then sad, and then-

825
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,020
 - It's either going to be a very slow read

826
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,420
 or it's going to sound like an extremely hardcore piece

827
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,260
 of list or something.

828
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:13,420
 The speed at which you're going to have to play that book.

829
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:17,180
 There was a guy who invented a language that was all musical

830
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:18,900
 and he thought it was around the time

831
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,620
 when everyone was inventing new languages

832
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,460
 like Esperanto and stuff like that.

833
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,940
 And he thought if we could come up with a language

834
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:28,660
 where all you needed was the tones,

835
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,540
 then everyone in the world would be able to speak it

836
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,140
 and it would end all wars and stuff.

837
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:32,980
 I can't remember his name.

838
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,700
 It was in that book that I mentioned a few times

839
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,860
 called "Bambard's Bolly"

840
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,100
 which people always ask about.

841
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,260
 But yeah, it's really, he's just really interesting.

842
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,820
 I can't remember anything more about him, sorry.

843
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:44,140
 - All right.

844
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:46,540
 - I think it means everyone will understand each other better.

845
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,580
 Everyone will understand each other's insults.

846
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:50,540
 There'll be lots more wars, actually.

847
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:52,380
 - Oh, really?

848
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,460
 - Yeah.

849
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:56,100
 - 'Cause that was the idea of all these universal languages

850
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,420
 that it would end all conflicts.

851
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,060
 But I suppose no one had your insight

852
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,940
 that actually naturally humans

853
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:03,340
 are just conflicts ridden species.

854
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:07,420
 - The Esperanto wars of the early 1920s were fierce and savage.

855
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:11,260
 Just on audiobooks.

856
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:16,660
 There's something, there was a great hero of audiobooks.

857
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:19,100
 It was a guy called Roy Louis Dotrice,

858
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,340
 or Dot Rice, I'm not sure his name's pronounced.

859
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,860
 Okay, so he died in 2017.

860
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,460
 He was 94 years old,

861
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,860
 but he had a Guinness World Record

862
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,260
 for his audiobook reading

863
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,500
 because he read the audiobooks

864
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:32,940
 for the first five "Game of Thrones" books.

865
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:35,700
 And he had to read so many hundreds of characters.

866
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:38,380
 So the first book has 224 characters in it.

867
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:40,700
 He has to do a different voice for every single one.

868
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,540
 He was actually meant to be in the "Game of Thrones" series

869
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,820
 in the actual TV series.

870
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,220
 Yeah, and he was offered a role

871
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,340
 and he turned it down

872
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:48,580
 because he was having medical issues at the time.

873
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:51,340
 So he thought, I just can't play this one role.

874
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:54,580
 So it's quite nice that he then ended up playing 224.

875
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,420
 - Yeah.

876
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:59,860
 - I did read an audiobook actor saying that one of the tricks

877
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,580
 is that when you get the text in advance,

878
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:04,660
 you check for what she called active attributions.

879
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,660
 And that is, if you have some speech,

880
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,660
 and then after the speech, it says like,

881
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:11,700
 she shouted or he whispered,

882
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,300
 you have to check ahead for that.

883
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:16,660
 'Cause you still wanna do three hundred words of text.

884
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:19,180
 - I would love to do, to write a book

885
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:21,340
 where on the very last page,

886
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,860
 you know, you've had dialogue all the way through.

887
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,100
 And on the very last page of the book,

888
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:27,340
 you say he said in his trademark,

889
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,220
 Nick Glaswegian accent.

890
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:32,380
 - Just one more thing about audiobooks,

891
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,700
 which is so interesting.

892
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,700
 You know, we were talking about

893
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,700
 how they were for blind people.

894
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:40,500
 And the first LP's, LP records,

895
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,940
 were made in the early 1930s,

896
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:46,060
 but the only people who were legally allowed to buy them

897
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:49,020
 between 1934 and 1948 were blind people.

898
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:49,860
 - Wow.

899
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,700
 - Wow.

900
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,580
 - So it's not amazing.

901
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,340
 They were, you couldn't,

902
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:57,500
 they weren't good enough quality to get good music on,

903
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,660
 but you could read audiobooks.

904
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,540
 And so it was this great service for the blind

905
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,940
 where you'd ask for a book on audio,

906
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,800
 you'd listen to the LP, you'd send it back.

907
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,120
 But they had to sign contracts with authors saying,

908
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,980
 we promise we'll check someone's blind.

909
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:11,460
 You have to send in your blind person's certification

910
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:14,380
 so that we don't give free books out to sightseek people.

911
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:16,220
 - It was that guy, was he called Ian Fraser?

912
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,260
 Did you say Ian Fraser?

913
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,360
 Yeah, and he came up with the technology

914
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,220
 where you basically make the grooves narrower,

915
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:24,060
 but you can kind of, and you play it slower,

916
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,340
 but you can fit more on a record.

917
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,340
 And that was like the LP technology

918
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:31,060
 that later became your 33s and more.

919
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,740
 - Ah, cool.

920
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:34,380
 That's so cool.

921
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,840
 'Cause you'd really seriously have to abridge

922
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,360
 Anna Karenina to get it on an LP, wouldn't you?

923
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,520
 We just cut straight to the main incident, wouldn't you?

924
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,280
 (laughing)

925
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,860
 (upbeat music)

926
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:50,720
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

927
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,360
 and that is James.

928
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:55,240
 - Okay, my fact this week is that in the 14th century,

929
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,600
 a weapon was invented that was essentially a windmill

930
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,880
 which flung out beehives from each of its arms.

931
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,580
 - Oh my goodness, we talked about some scary things

932
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,860
 already on this podcast, but what about that?

933
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:10,740
 - It's so amazing thinking of what this would have looked

934
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,100
 like and how it would have functioned.

935
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:15,260
 - Yeah, I mean, I doubt it probably existed, I'll be honest.

936
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:18,540
 It was a guy called Walter de Millimet,

937
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:21,980
 and he was a scholar, and Queen Isabella of France

938
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,780
 commissioned him to write a treatise

939
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:26,740
 on how to be a good king for her son.

940
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,500
 And part of this how to be a good king

941
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:31,100
 was gonna have all the different like new weapons

942
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,160
 and stuff like that that are out there.

943
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,280
 And he in fact gave us the first

944
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,000
 Western illustration of a gun.

945
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,720
 We didn't have anything before that,

946
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,880
 or if we did, we've lost it.

947
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,440
 And one of the things that he had was this siege weapon,

948
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:49,440
 which was a windmill with beehives flung out at the enemy.

949
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,680
 And whether it existed or not,

950
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,640
 it was definitely existed in people's minds enough

951
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,600
 to be included in this treatise.

952
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,640
 - It's like a really cool concept worship or something.

953
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,540
 You see those all the time these days,

954
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:03,300
 this is the worship of tomorrow.

955
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,340
 This must have been the thing

956
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:06,500
 everyone was really excited about in the 14th century.

957
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,860
 - It's like the hoverboard.

958
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:11,160
 - Yeah, it's like, where's my beehive windmill?

959
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,180
 - Yeah.

960
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:14,380
 - Do you think they had those kind of demonstration days

961
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:15,620
 where it's like an expo,

962
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:17,260
 you go and see the latest developments?

963
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:18,100
 - Definitely.

964
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:18,940
 - Yeah.

965
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:21,480
 - Yeah, that is amazing.

966
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,500
 So we don't know if it ever was deployed in war.

967
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,660
 - We don't know, and I suspect it wasn't,

968
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:29,260
 because I suspect if it was,

969
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:32,240
 we might have a lot more people writing at the time

970
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,320
 about this amazing windmill beehive thing.

971
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,320
 - I don't know.

972
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,360
 Bees seem to be deployed quite often though.

973
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,000
 Maybe it was just so run of the mill,

974
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,960
 run of the windmill, you know what I'm saying.

975
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,120
 But bees do seem to be a wartime weapon.

976
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,840
 So that's, you know, just standard.

977
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,200
 I was reading about the Kishay people,

978
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,440
 the Mayan people who have the Popol Vu,

979
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,440
 which I think we've talked about before,

980
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,360
 which is their book of their history.

981
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:59,200
 And they used beehives to frighten away the enemy,

982
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:03,180
 in fact, they use kind of Scarecrow come Halloween pumpkins.

983
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:06,020
 And they described it as surrounding their citadel

984
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,980
 with these effigies that were built

985
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,220
 to look exactly like people.

986
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:11,500
 So with armor and arrows and shields and stuff.

987
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,140
 And then they had huge headdresses.

988
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:14,620
 And then they had gourds.

989
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:17,380
 I think as heads, or possibly beside them,

990
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:19,380
 it's not clear in the text.

991
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:20,780
 And then they stuffed their heads

992
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:22,540
 with wasps and hornets and stuff.

993
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:24,740
 And then you smash it open when the enemy comes along.

994
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:27,020
 It's like a terrible pinata on a horrible birthday.

995
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:28,140
 - It's a bit like that movie

996
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:29,760
 where the bees come out of the guy's mouth,

997
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,600
 which I haven't seen.

998
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,440
 - Candyman.

999
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,280
 - Yeah.

1000
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,120
 - Candyman.

1001
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,200
 - It's also, I was thinking it's a bit like Home Alone,

1002
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:38,280
 where Kevin creates a party out of cardboard cutouts.

1003
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,960
 It's kind of like that.

1004
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,720
 - All these things were inspired by this Mayan text.

1005
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,960
 - Richard the Lionheart, when he went on the crusade,

1006
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,640
 he had enough beehives to fill 13 ships,

1007
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,720
 according to people writing at the time.

1008
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,920
 Doesn't sound very likely, but that's what they said.

1009
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,480
 - How many ships did he have?

1010
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,320
 - 14.

1011
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:00,220
 (all laughing)

1012
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,500
 - It's just the four beekeepers in the army.

1013
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:08,020
 - More modern times, still deploying the bees.

1014
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:08,860
 - Oh yeah?

1015
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:11,020
 - So bees were used in the Vietnam War.

1016
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:14,300
 And it was particularly when the Viet Cong would be hiding

1017
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:15,420
 and they'd be watching the Americans

1018
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:16,980
 and watching the trails that they used.

1019
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:20,540
 And then they would plant beehives along these trails.

1020
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:21,580
 So they took beehives from elsewhere,

1021
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:24,260
 planted them on the trails, rigged them up to explosives,

1022
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:26,400
 little explosives, and then they'd explode them

1023
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,440
 onto the hives as the Americans ran past.

1024
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:32,280
 And you just get a horrible sting, nasty bee sting.

1025
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:35,760
 - Did you read about the yellow rain in the Vietnam War?

1026
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,760
 I mean, that's a really interesting thing.

1027
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,480
 So the idea was there were all these reports

1028
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,680
 that yellow rain was coming down

1029
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,680
 and it was believed to be chemical warfare.

1030
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:47,440
 So the Americans, the Secretary of State,

1031
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,400
 Alexander Hague, accused the Soviet Union

1032
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,920
 of using T2 mycotoxin,

1033
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,620
 which would then be dropped over the people

1034
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:56,460
 and they were all getting burns and stuff.

1035
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:58,460
 And there's been so many,

1036
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:00,220
 I mean, it's still ongoing as a dispute

1037
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:01,780
 about whether or not it really was that.

1038
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:04,220
 Because what most people who've studied it think it was

1039
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:06,100
 is honeybee feces.

1040
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:08,740
 And that's what they believe was being dropped on them,

1041
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:11,180
 basically not by the Soviet Union,

1042
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:13,900
 but huge flocks of honeybees

1043
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:15,540
 that were traveling around together

1044
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:17,020
 and defecating at the same time,

1045
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:18,860
 a sort of mass defecation.

1046
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:21,220
 And that's what the yellow rain was.

1047
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:23,320
 And there were so many reports have been continuing

1048
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,280
 on and on where people are saying

1049
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,080
 that it was chemical warfare,

1050
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,280
 locals saying that they were burnt and stuff,

1051
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,840
 other people saying it wasn't.

1052
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:32,600
 - It's very embarrassing to have to backtrack

1053
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,040
 saying you were chemically attacked

1054
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,920
 and suddenly you were just shat on by a bee.

1055
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,360
 I wouldn't accept that if I were the locals.

1056
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,440
 But yeah, they've studied the substance, haven't they?

1057
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,480
 And found that can only have come from these bees.

1058
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:46,320
 And apparently it's when it gets particularly hot.

1059
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:49,280
 So it's on hot days that it would rain yellow.

1060
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,380
 And it's because the bees get super hot in their hive.

1061
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:53,340
 So they have to go out and lose mass

1062
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:54,260
 because the more mass you've got,

1063
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:55,380
 the more heat you generate.

1064
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:58,300
 So you all go out and do this mass shit,

1065
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:59,500
 cools you down.

1066
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:02,460
 - But one of the theories then was in order to disguise

1067
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:03,980
 that they were using chemical warfare,

1068
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:07,220
 the Soviet Union had actually gone to Vietnam,

1069
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:09,420
 collected all of this, brought it back,

1070
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:13,180
 mixed it in to the actual chemical warfare stuff

1071
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:16,660
 because it helps it to have more of an effect,

1072
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:19,920
 supposedly this pollen that would be within the chemical.

1073
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,280
 I mean, it's bizarre.

1074
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,160
 The Rhodes people have gone down with this.

1075
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:25,600
 - How would you collect the bee feces?

1076
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:26,440
 - You need a lot of bees.

1077
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:27,920
 - To mix it into your chemical weapons?

1078
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,900
 - You get 13 bolts of bees.

1079
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:37,080
 - I found one other Roman bee use in war.

1080
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:40,800
 And this is in Appian, Appian is a Roman historian.

1081
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,920
 He described this thing in the third Mithridatic Wars,

1082
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,960
 it was 72 BC.

1083
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:50,860
 Basically the Roman army were besieging Themiskira,

1084
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:55,540
 which is a city, I think it's south of the Black Sea.

1085
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:57,660
 And basically the Roman army were besieging a city,

1086
00:46:57,660 --> 00:46:58,940
 that's all you really need to know.

1087
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:02,180
 But the inhabitants cut openings in the ground

1088
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:04,400
 'cause the Romans were tunneling in as part of the siege.

1089
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,280
 That's what you do in a siege, you dig tunnels.

1090
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:07,740
 But the inhabitants apparently cut openings

1091
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:09,600
 from above into the tunnels

1092
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,780
 and they would thrust down bears and other wild animals

1093
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:15,300
 and swarms of bees into the openings.

1094
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:17,340
 So if you were a Roman soldier in the tunnel

1095
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:19,000
 and you felt something coming down from above,

1096
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,980
 it might be a swarm of bees or it might be a bear.

1097
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:24,060
 - Oh my God, it's like a lucky dip.

1098
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:24,900
 - Yeah.

1099
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:25,740
 - Yeah.

1100
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:27,400
 - It's like one of those which would win in a fight

1101
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,960
 between a thousand bees and one bear.

1102
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:34,100
 - It's like what happened in the Northampton branch of boots

1103
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:36,520
 on the 9th of February, 2020.

1104
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:40,540
 - There was also in the first century,

1105
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:43,260
 there was, and this was in Asia Minor,

1106
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:45,460
 there was the idea of using,

1107
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:47,380
 and we've spoken about mad honey before,

1108
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:48,980
 but using mad honey.

1109
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:53,180
 So this is honey that has a poisonous element to it,

1110
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:55,460
 which a lot of people, if mixed in lightly into a drink,

1111
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:57,420
 can drink and have a high of it.

1112
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:59,380
 But quite a big amount could actually cause you

1113
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:01,140
 to have huge stomach problems,

1114
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:03,060
 possibly even fatal to some people.

1115
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:05,900
 And supposedly this was used as a way

1116
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:08,700
 of taking out an army that was advancing

1117
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:12,220
 onto this city of heptapcomoties.

1118
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:13,540
 Have you heptapcomoties?

1119
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:14,820
 - Never heard of it, sorry.

1120
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:15,660
 - Yeah.

1121
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:18,700
 I tried to look for a pronunciation online.

1122
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:21,040
 - Was that where a lot of hep cats lived?

1123
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,300
 (laughing)

1124
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,620
 - Heptacomoties, is that it?

1125
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:26,940
 - Heptacomoties.

1126
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:27,780
 - How are you spelling it?

1127
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:32,580
 - Heptacomoties, H-E-P-T-A-K-O-M-E-T-E-S.

1128
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:35,180
 - All you need to know is it's a town in Asia Minor.

1129
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:38,660
 - It's a town in Asia Minor that being

1130
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:40,780
 advanced on by a Roman army,

1131
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:42,140
 and there was about a thousand of them.

1132
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:43,180
 And the story goes,

1133
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:45,860
 and this was written by a philosopher called Strabo.

1134
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:48,980
 He said that basically they had taken this honey

1135
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:49,820
 and they'd mixed it up,

1136
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:51,500
 but they'd left them in pots.

1137
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:53,460
 And the idea was they would see it on the way.

1138
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:55,420
 And it'd be like finding a bottle of water on the way

1139
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:56,860
 if you were advancing on somewhere

1140
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:58,940
 and you needed it badly.

1141
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:01,460
 - Dan, Dan, it's a honey trap.

1142
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:02,300
 - Yes.

1143
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:03,460
 - It's a honey trap.

1144
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:04,580
 - Yeah.

1145
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:07,180
 - It was a big buildup you made Dan do for that.

1146
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:08,700
 (all laughing)

1147
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:10,620
 - I know, giving me all those big words.

1148
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:11,460
 What are you doing?

1149
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:13,620
 (all laughing)

1150
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:15,260
 - Did we get to the end of it?

1151
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:17,860
 - It kind of like with your story about the windmills.

1152
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:20,180
 It's sort of a lot of these histories about this stuff

1153
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:21,220
 are quite disputed.

1154
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:22,540
 We don't fully know.

1155
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:24,540
 There's a lot of people who've extrapolated

1156
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:25,980
 what they think then happened.

1157
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:27,660
 Like the army was then taken out.

1158
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:29,260
 We don't actually have any written evidence

1159
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:31,500
 that it actually had any effect on the army whatsoever.

1160
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:32,340
 - Right.

1161
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:34,100
 I think Mad Honey has,

1162
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:37,100
 well, certainly people have claimed that they've used it

1163
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:41,420
 so there was Empress Olga in 946, Olga of Kiev,

1164
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:44,100
 who offered the enemy mead to drink

1165
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:45,780
 and it was full of Mad Honey.

1166
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:47,620
 And what it does is it kind of knocks you out.

1167
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:49,140
 Like if you take a strong hallucinogenic,

1168
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:50,860
 you just pass out, it's stupefied

1169
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:54,260
 and then they massacred 5,000 people, I think.

1170
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:55,900
 And then again, Ivan the Great,

1171
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:58,620
 I think just left fat of spiked mead,

1172
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,860
 spiked with Mad Honey in his own camp

1173
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:02,780
 and then he and his soldiers left.

1174
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:04,700
 And yeah, the troops came and like you said Dan,

1175
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:07,380
 they came in and thought, oh, I wonder why this has been left here?

1176
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:08,700
 Let's drink it all.

1177
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:11,740
 And then drank it all, fell asleep and were massacred.

1178
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:12,740
 - Why can't they resist?

1179
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:13,860
 Don't they know?

1180
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:15,180
 They're not Winnie the Pooh, they don't...

1181
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:16,020
 - I know.

1182
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:17,340
 (laughing)

1183
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:20,500
 - Honey, honey, Tommy.

1184
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:23,340
 - I think Olga of Kiev, I might be wrong about this,

1185
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:27,180
 but was she the one where they killed her husband

1186
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:28,700
 and to get her own back,

1187
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:31,500
 she's kind of got her army to this town,

1188
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,820
 forced them to all give her a pigeon

1189
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:35,420
 and said, okay, give us a pigeon

1190
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:36,780
 or I'm gonna do you in.

1191
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:38,260
 And they went, okay, we'll give you a pigeon.

1192
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:40,660
 So everyone in the town gave her a pigeon

1193
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:43,660
 and then she tied some fire stuff

1194
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:45,140
 to the legs of the pigeons

1195
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:46,260
 and they're all homing pigeons.

1196
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:49,140
 So they all flew back and they burned the town down.

1197
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:50,140
 - Oh, was that Olga?

1198
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:50,980
 - I think so.

1199
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:52,460
 - She was full of wacky ideas.

1200
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:53,820
 She should have been employed by Disney

1201
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:55,220
 to build the haunted mansion.

1202
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:57,280
 - She was a dick dastardly of her day.

1203
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,540
 (laughing)

1204
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:03,220
 - Can I just quickly mention one last thing

1205
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:04,060
 before we wrap up,

1206
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:08,060
 which is that I discovered animals in war

1207
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:10,620
 and accusations of people using them for their benefit.

1208
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:15,620
 In 2007, the British forces had to actively deny rumors

1209
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:18,540
 that they had released a plague of ferocious badgers

1210
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:19,820
 into Basra.

1211
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:20,860
 (laughing)

1212
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:21,980
 - Really?

1213
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:23,540
 - Yeah, Major Mike Shearer,

1214
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:25,140
 the UK military spokesperson,

1215
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:26,740
 say we can categorically state

1216
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:29,980
 that we have not released man-eating badgers into the area.

1217
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:33,620
 And this had been claimed by a lot of the locals

1218
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:35,980
 that they had been seeing and killing

1219
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:38,660
 these large, giant honey badgers.

1220
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:39,860
 And...

1221
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:40,700
 - Oh, honey badgers.

1222
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:43,500
 - But it was not his trick when he was denying it.

1223
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:46,620
 He was like, "No, we haven't done any badgers here."

1224
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:47,460
 No.

1225
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:49,660
 (upbeat music)

1226
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:50,900
 - Okay, that's it.

1227
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:51,900
 That is all of our facts.

1228
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,180
 Thank you so much for listening.

1229
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:55,060

 And that's it.

1244
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:19,740
 We'll be back again next week.

1245
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:22,060
 And don't forget, Anna Karenina

1246
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:24,500
 gets killed by a brain at the end of our live.

1247
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:25,340
 - Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

1248
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:26,660
 - Good bye.

1249
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:29,240
 (upbeat music)

1250
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:32,700
 (upbeat music)

1251
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:35,280
 (upbeat music)

1252
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,860
 (upbeat music)
