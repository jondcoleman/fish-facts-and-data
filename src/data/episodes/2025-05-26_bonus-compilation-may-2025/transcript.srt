1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
 Hey Clubfish members, how you doing?

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,000
 It is a compilation episode for you this week.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,920
 All the off-cuts from the main episode that didn't quite fit into the narrative shape

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,360
 of what we wanted to put out in the main episodes, but still awesome stuff, and so we're really

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,320
 glad that we've got somewhere for you all to hear it.

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:22,640
 So before we get into today's episode, I should say that our first live show of the year

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,040
 is creeping up on us.

8
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,960
 It's going to be a festival in Belgium at the Nerdland Festival, so it's going to be

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:34,080
 us four fishers on stage doing an entire live recording at one of the greatest festivals

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,680
 in the world, and I say that really sincerely.

11
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,240
 I love going to it.

12
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,640
 It is such a joyous occasion.

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,880
 Everywhere you go is just pockets of nerddom.

14
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,880
 It's really kid-friendly.

15
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,800
 It's really worth going to if you're able to.

16
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,560
 Event wise, it probably helps to speak the local languages, but there are often a bunch

17
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,040
 of English events like our event.

18
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,680
 So yeah, do check that out.

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,680
 It's called Nerdland.

20
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,680
 You can find it online.

21
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,560
 You can find tickets to our website, and if you go to our website looking for those tickets,

22
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:06,520
 you'll also see a link to our first UK live show, which is going to be at the cross-twires

23
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,520
 festival.

24
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,640
 I've been mentioning it at the end of every single episode.

25
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,640
 Come to our show.

26
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,640
 We're going to be doing a live recording.

27
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,960
 There's going to be a few extra fun bits going on.

28
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,800
 If you're near the area, please do come.

29
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,080
 So again, just head to our website, and you'll find the links there.

30
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,040
 All right, let's get on with the compilation.

31
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,920
 The only thing to say about it is you're going to notice sort of halfway through a conversation

32
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,960
 that happens where we're unsure who is right.

33
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,760
 I won't say anything ahead of it, but I just want you to know, turns out we were both right.

34
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,600
 You'll see what I mean when you get to it.

35
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,600
 Anyway, here we go.

36
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,200
 On with the compilation.

37
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:59,000
 You used to have to be able to fake cry as your job, if you had a specific job in Paris

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 in the 1820s.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 Oh, is this gettable?

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,480
 It's just like an official, like, a mourner.

41
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:08,880
 What about a trick of hers, like the people who were at the bottom of a guillotine watching

42
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,880
 people die?

43
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,840
 Oh, I didn't know that was a thing.

44
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,440
 Yeah, you're like used to get women who weren't knitting.

45
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,440
 Oh, the knitted.

46
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,120
 Are we supposed to cry as well?

47
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,880
 They were quite cheerful about the whole thing, though.

48
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,880
 Yeah, they were thinking they were knitting.

49
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,880
 That was their entertainment, was the guillotine.

50
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,880
 1820s.

51
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,880
 So it's a bit after the Paleonic Wars.

52
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,880
 In Paris.

53
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,720
 You know about these people, but we've never mentioned them before on the show.

54
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,440
 It's specifically the Clacker, which we have never mentioned before.

55
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:37,360
 These are people who would be paid to go to the theatre and have a certain reaction.

56
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,760
 So if you went to see a play in Paris, a few dozen spots would be occupied by Clacker.

57
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,480
 If it was a comedy, they'd be employed to laugh.

58
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,600
 They'd be employed to, like, gasp.

59
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,240
 They'd be employed to sob.

60
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,800
 And you had different types of Clackers.

61
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,640
 There was actually a Clacker school that was set up by a guy called Musseur Soutot.

62
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:00,000
 And you'd have the Rhea, who were the loud laughers, and then you'd have the plurras, who were

63
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,680
 the cries, who were women who were paid to turn up and cry hysterically.

64
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,000
 And then actually, I've been so annoying sitting next to these people in the theatre.

65
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 People got really annoyed.

66
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,040
 They used to look quite a lot of fights between audience members and Clackers, especially

67
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,200
 because you also had the commissaires who were a type of Clacker who memorized the better

68
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,480
 parts of the play to call their neighbours attention to them.

69
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,480
 So I suppose that...

70
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,520
 That's like an English teacher in a Shakespeare play.

71
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,520
 To be up, did you hear that?

72
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,520
 To be up, not to be?

73
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,520
 Did you remember?

74
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,520
 Yeah, it's good, isn't it?

75
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,520
 Yeah.

76
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,520
 That is the most annoying thing someone can do at the theatre.

77
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,520
 Point of stuff out.

78
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,320
 Like repeatedly, or if you're at a concert and someone's humming along next to you, like a

79
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,320
 classical concert.

80
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,320
 Oh, right.

81
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,320
 Oh.

82
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,320
 Like a Bruce Springson concert.

83
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,320
 And everyone's singing board in the USA and then he's going, "I'm trying to listen to Bruce."

84
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,320
 I mean, I do.

85
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,320
 I do.

86
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,320
 I do slightly.

87
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,320
 I do slightly.

88
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,320
 It's not about us, isn't it?

89
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,320
 It's about Bruce's song.

90
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,200
 20 years ago, I would have disagreed with you Andy, but I'm totally on board now.

91
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,200
 Stop singing.

92
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,200
 Let the dude sing.

93
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,200
 Bruce.

94
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,200
 They leave gaps.

95
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,200
 Actually, this really pisses me off.

96
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,200
 If Bruce thought anyone else is listening, it really annoys me.

97
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,520
 When you go to a concert, someone you love, they're singing their big song and they leave

98
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,160
 the big gap for the audience to sing it.

99
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,160
 Yeah.

100
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,800
 And you're so excited about hearing them sing these words.

101
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,320
 I don't want to hear as to how some people sing.

102
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,320
 You don't get that.

103
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,120
 You don't get that in, like, the importance of being honest.

104
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,120
 Really?

105
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,120
 Do you guys see that?

106
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,120
 Like, handbag?

107
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,120
 Yeah.

108
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,120
 Lately, Rangel doesn't pause again.

109
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,120
 She said, though.

110
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,120
 Yeah.

111
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,120
 Are you big?

112
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,120
 To be or?

113
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,120
 To be or?

114
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,120
 [laughter]

115
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,120
 Tears in general?

116
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,240
 Crocodile tears.

117
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,560
 Are they fake tears, too?

118
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,560
 They're fake tears.

119
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,560
 Exactly.

120
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:41,720
 And this was an ancient belief that crocodiles would cry while eating their prey, and that

121
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,480
 gave rise to this phrase, crocodile tears, if someone's crying, but they don't mean it.

122
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,480
 You know, they're just pretending.

123
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,200
 And yet, it was tested by a couple of researchers a few years ago.

124
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:56,080
 And it seems to be true that crocodiles tear ducks get a bit loosey goosey when they're

125
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,080
 eating.

126
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:03,520
 And a research called Kent Vliet fed seven camons, specifically, so quite crocodilian creatures,

127
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,520
 because they eat on dry land.

128
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:09,160
 So it's a bit easier to observe them than an alligator underwater or crocodile underwater.

129
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,160
 Yes.

130
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,960
 Five out of the seven that were fed, wept as they ate.

131
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,960
 No way.

132
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,960
 So it is a real thing.

133
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,120
 And it might be to do with the way air is moving into their sinuses and getting mixed

134
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,680
 around and their tear glands then dump a little fluid into their eye because of the chewing

135
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,680
 process.

136
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,640
 Or they could be feeling a bit guilty about it.

137
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:32,360
 Because there was a previous study, wasn't there like a hundred years ago, where a guy took

138
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,120
 a crocodile and rubbed onions in its eyes.

139
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,840
 And then no tears came out and it's like, oh, look, they can't cry.

140
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,840
 So it can't be true.

141
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,840
 Oh, really?

142
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,920
 In fact, they just, they don't, well, they probably wasn't happy about it, but they're not that

143
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,920
 fussed about onions.

144
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,920
 They're not so excited.

145
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,920
 Yeah.

146
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,680
 That's a crazy experiment to do.

147
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,680
 Yeah, good one.

148
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,320
 To just prove a relatively minor saying, you know, that's amazing.

149
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,880
 Basically that, would that have been an episode on Mythbusters or is that one where they

150
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,880
 go, actually, do you know what?

151
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,880
 I'm good.

152
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,880
 I'm good with the onions.

153
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,880
 Adam savaged.

154
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,880
 Oh, lovely.

155
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,880
 Lovely.

156
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,880
 There's the sun for you.

157
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,880
 There's the sun headline.

158
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:12,360
 It's like the three of us love it and then it was kind of always destroyed.

159
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,480
 But the thing is, like, the joke was a good, okay joke.

160
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,480
 And then you two didn't laugh.

161
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:22,720
 You just had, just love it, because when you do it so much, it becomes something to

162
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,720
 just sit in awe.

163
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,720
 You know.

164
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,720
 I'm actually a clacker.

165
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,120
 I've been paid by Dan to laugh at his jokes for ten years.

166
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,600
 But not to laugh at you.

167
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,760
 So you mentioned the other happy birthday song.

168
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,760
 Yep.

169
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,760
 The main one.

170
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,760
 Happy birthday to you.

171
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,760
 Happy birthday to you.

172
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,760
 Happy birthday dear.

173
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,760
 Insert name.

174
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,760
 Happy birthday to you.

175
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,760
 That was...

176
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,760
 I never knew the lyrics otherwise.

177
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,760
 Yeah.

178
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,760
 It's like the National Anthem.

179
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,760
 You really know it first, right?

180
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,680
 That was written by Mildred J. Hill and her sister Patti.

181
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,760
 I think who we might have mentioned before.

182
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:01,400
 But what I didn't know is that she was a scholar of African-American music.

183
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,480
 And this was what she was most famous for in her day.

184
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:09,200
 She wrote a lot of articles about African-American music and was so influential that Antonin

185
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:15,000
 Vosjak's New World Symphony was written having him read her articles on African-American

186
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 music.

187
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 Really?

188
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,400
 Which is obviously a huge deal.

189
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,680
 That came out before she died.

190
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,640
 She died in 1916, but the happy birthday song didn't become well known until about 20 years

191
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,400
 after she died.

192
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:32,040
 So she went to her grave thinking, "I'm going to be famous forever because I inspired the

193
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,040
 New World Symphony."

194
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:37,720
 And because I wrote all this stuff on African-American music, but actually, she wrote the most famous song

195
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,720
 in the world.

196
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,720
 Wow.

197
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,720
 Even better.

198
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,720
 That's great.

199
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,720
 What would you rather listen to?

200
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,720
 Really?

201
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,720
 Happy birthday or Anton Vosjak's New World Symphony?

202
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,720
 I think it depends how long you have to listen to it for.

203
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,440
 If it doesn't have a disc, I'll probably take the New World Symphony.

204
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:54,120
 On day two, I think happy birthday is going to be starting to great.

205
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,240
 You're a Pokemon fan, James.

206
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,440
 Did you ever play the cards?

207
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,440
 A bit.

208
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:03,520
 So the cards, they used to be a card called the Happy Birthday Pikachu.

209
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,720
 And the Happy Birthday Pikachu is one of the only, there's about ten band Pokemon cards

210
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,200
 that are no longer in circulation that we're taking out.

211
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:21,680
 And the reason for it is because it was a card that if it happened to be your birthday on

212
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,200
 the day that you were playing with this card, it had sort of double point, it had a way

213
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,280
 more power to it, and it could make you defeat your opponent.

214
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,280
 So the issue was, most people don't, most kids aren't bringing their passports with them.

215
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:37,760
 So everyone was just claiming it was their birthday in a game, and they realized this is,

216
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,760
 this is a cheat.

217
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,760
 So it got burned as a result.

218
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,680
 Just get away with that, I don't know, get their mates will go, no, it's not, you had a birthday

219
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,680
 party three weeks ago.

220
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,680
 Not stupid.

221
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,720
 So I can't, if things had to be banned in games because kids were cheating at them, then

222
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,720
 no game would be allowed.

223
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,720
 That's true.

224
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,720
 That's true.

225
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,720
 That's true.

226
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,720
 That's true.

227
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:00,240
 Do you know what kind of birthday party features Muffin Huff?

228
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,240
 Okay.

229
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,240
 Muffin Huff.

230
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,240
 Muffin Huff.

231
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,240
 Muffin Huff.

232
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,720
 I actually can't think of any category of birthday party.

233
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,400
 What about horse's birthday party?

234
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,000
 That's a good, I should have just asked, can you think of a category of birthday party?

235
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,760
 Because that is actually what this is, but there aren't that many.

236
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,760
 Category of birthday party.

237
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,880
 Yeah, belongs to a specific religion.

238
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,160
 Oh, Huff and Puff, did you say?

239
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,040
 You're not going to get it from Muffin Huff.

240
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,040
 Believe you, me.

241
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,160
 It's not a Huff or Puff, it's not a Harry Potter birthday party.

242
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,160
 It's a religion.

243
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,160
 It is.

244
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,160
 It's a hovers witness.

245
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,560
 Oh, you've picked the one religion that doesn't tell about birthday party.

246
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,400
 That's why I was wondering if it was not turning.

247
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,400
 Yeah.

248
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,400
 That was right there.

249
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,400
 Sorry.

250
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,400
 Sorry.

251
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,200
 We'll like a bar mitzvah as after your 13th.

252
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,200
 Very good.

253
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,200
 Very good bar mitzvah.

254
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,880
 But now, I couldn't point any more to reference this, but in a book called Bar mitzvah

255
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,320
 History by this rabbi in historian, he said that since 1789, it was common to read the

256
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,160
 mafti and the haftaro, which are readings from the Torah and Prophet's books.

257
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,480
 And that was always shortened to Muffin Huff.

258
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,480
 So you have a bit of Muffin Huff.

259
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,480
 Lovely.

260
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,480
 And their religious readings.

261
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,360
 It's not as fun as it sounds.

262
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:12,480
 Have you guys heard this 1905, there was an attempt to change officially the date of Thanksgiving

263
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,160
 in America from November 30th to another date altogether because of a birthday?

264
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,160
 Oh, no.

265
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,680
 I thought there was something.

266
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,800
 There was something about changing it, the shopkeepers all wanted to change it, because

267
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,800
 it was too close to Christmas.

268
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,800
 So is it the 30th?

269
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,120
 I thought it was one of those slightly movable things.

270
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,120
 Oh, yeah.

271
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,120
 It's the third day after.

272
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,120
 Sorry.

273
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,120
 It's specifically 1905.

274
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,120
 Oh, sorry.

275
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,120
 Yeah, yeah.

276
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,120
 It was the 30th of November at Lando.

277
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,480
 But it came on the same day as Martin Luther King's birthday and--

278
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,480
 It cuts.

279
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,080
 It's less sort of powerful.

280
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,720
 Mark Twain was turning 70 on that day.

281
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,720
 Really?

282
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,720
 And he was really--

283
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,640
 He was going to have a magnum of the Black House.

284
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,960
 He was really worried.

285
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:55,880
 Now, there could be a possibility that this is done ironically, but I didn't read it anywhere

286
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,880
 that it was.

287
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,880
 He wanted a big birthday.

288
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,840
 He had 170 guests on the invitation.

289
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,200
 And he was worried that all of them would stay home and not come out to the party because

290
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,480
 they were celebrating their Thanksgiving.

291
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:11,200
 And so him and his editor basically approached Theodore Roosevelt, president at the time,

292
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,920
 and lobbied for him to move it, either just miss it that year or move it to another day

293
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,920
 that year.

294
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,720
 I know he's an enemy of the porkers, but he's still not doing this seriously.

295
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,280
 It doesn't feel like it can be, right?

296
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,440
 But they do have the letter that was sent that was handed to the president.

297
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,520
 He heard about Elon Musk having his hooks in with the government.

298
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,160
 You don't realize this is a very old tradition of food to say, can you move Thanksgiving

299
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,160
 for me?

300
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,160
 That's shocking.

301
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,160
 I'm sorry, guys.

302
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,160
 This year we're not going to have Thanksgiving on the double day because Elon Musk wants to have

303
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,160
 a birthday party.

304
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,160
 Give it a year.

305
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,160
 I give it one year.

306
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,160
 Wow.

307
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,240
 There's no reason why planes need to be symmetrical.

308
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,240
 Okay.

309
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,960
 But if you've got a plane, if you use a large picture of that, you put one wing on one side,

310
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,960
 where do you put the other wing?

311
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,960
 Oh, that's right.

312
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,960
 Okay.

313
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,960
 It does have to go on the other side.

314
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,960
 That's true.

315
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,960
 But it does.

316
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,960
 This is all sounding a bit Elon Musk.

317
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,960
 It's sounding a bit doge, I'm afraid.

318
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,960
 Why do we have...

319
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,960
 Why do we need wings at all?

320
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,080
 Well, a little correctness has gone mad.

321
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,520
 The wing doesn't have to be in the same place on the other side.

322
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,920
 And in fact, an asymmetrical plane is more aerodynamic.

323
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,560
 And there's this one guy who started saying this in the '50s and '60s saying that, basically,

324
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,280
 if you've got the wings both symmetrically aligned on the plane, that increases drag

325
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,920
 and it's much less fuel efficient than if you tilt them at a diagonal.

326
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,640
 So one is pointing forwards and one is pointing backwards.

327
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,920
 So that makes it more streamlined.

328
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,440
 And it actually flies just as well.

329
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,440
 This is cool.

330
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,880
 There was one plane made, eventually by this guy called RT Jones, who said for 30 years,

331
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,120
 this is a better way of doing it.

332
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,280
 And all other engineers just said it, people don't like asymmetry.

333
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,840
 That's literally the only reason is like human beings don't want to look at a plane.

334
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,840
 This German one looks obsessing.

335
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,840
 Yeah.

336
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,840
 It's hard to see it.

337
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,600
 You don't want to get on it.

338
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,600
 He made one.

339
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,600
 It was called the Armors Dryden.

340
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,480
 It was a NASA aircraft.

341
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,600
 And all the pilots who flew it said it worked completely fine, couldn't fault it.

342
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,240
 The wing rotated to 60 degree angle.

343
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,240
 So very sharp.

344
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,240
 I need some credit.

345
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,560
 Imagine if he'd been wrong and spent 30 years saying, we can do a nice thing, right?

346
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,240
 Then it took off and then immediately crashed, and then he would have felt so bad.

347
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,240
 Yeah.

348
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,240
 Yeah, yeah.

349
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,240
 That's so cool that it was, actually.

350
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,240
 Jesus.

351
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,640
 Do you guys know about the inflator plane?

352
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,640
 Sounds like.

353
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,640
 Sounds like what it is.

354
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,640
 Is it?

355
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,640
 Yeah.

356
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,640
 Blow up plane.

357
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,640
 Blow up plane.

358
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,640
 It's really exciting as an idea.

359
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,640
 It can't believe it still doesn't.

360
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,640
 Terrible news.

361
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,640
 Your planes blown up.

362
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,640
 Good news.

363
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,640
 It's an inflator plane.

364
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,800
 So this was a good, it was called the good year inflator plane.

365
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:36,400
 And the idea was that if you had soldiers who were stuck behind enemy line, you could drop

366
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,400
 a plane out of the sky and no one really knows us that you were doing that.

367
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,400
 And it could land.

368
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,480
 And all you would need to do is inflate it to come with a pump.

369
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:51,640
 If you get a very, very tired mouth, how's that, how's that plane coming up?

370
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,600
 You need to squeeze the nipple.

371
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,000
 That will get the air in.

372
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,480
 It's pretty insane, isn't it?

373
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,480
 Wait, does it?

374
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,240
 So the door opens and you said, is it like a bouncy castle?

375
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,240
 It's like a bouncy castle.

376
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,160
 And what you do is it doesn't actually have an engine, but you just have to pop it and

377
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,160
 it goes.

378
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,160
 Yeah.

379
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:18,280
 On Japanese traffic lights, they're just a bit weird, a bit weird than all the traffic

380
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,280
 lights, right?

381
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,280
 Because their green isn't normal green.

382
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,520
 That was by government decree.

383
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,240
 So I think some of them have changed now.

384
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:32,240
 But basically, in 1973, the Japanese government decreed that the green light on traffic lights

385
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,760
 should be as close to blue as legally possible.

386
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:38,640
 Now, they've signed up to an international convention, which says the green light has to

387
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,640
 be green.

388
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,640
 So this needs to be a global thing.

389
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,640
 So everyone knows green is green.

390
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,120
 But the problem the Japanese people had is that for some reason, when they started putting

391
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,240
 traffic lights up, the start was the 20th century, they used their word 'awai'.

392
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,560
 Which, at the time, referred to sort of span both green and blue in the colour spectrum,

393
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,160
 like the Japanese language as a slightly different conception of green and blue.

394
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,520
 Now, it's mostly used for blue and green as referred to as 'madori'.

395
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:05,880
 But they've always called the green traffic light their word for blue, what's now blue?

396
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,880
 'awai'.

397
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,240
 So they were like, this is really confusing because we referred to it as a blue light, even

398
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,240
 though it's green now, what do we do to resolve this?

399
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,240
 So the government just said, right, make it blue.

400
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,480
 We're not allowed to make it blue.

401
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,480
 Make it quite blue.

402
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,480
 The blue is possible kind of green.

403
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:24,480
 Because the Japanese law-rebiding nation they wanted to adhere to the 1968 Vienna Convention

404
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,320
 on road signs and signals, which, guess who hasn't signed that one?

405
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,320
 A few places, didn't.

406
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,320
 The US didn't for sure.

407
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,320
 The US didn't.

408
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,720
 Such a big country, they haven't signed up to the main.

409
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,720
 Yeah.

410
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,720
 That's why their green is pink.

411
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,720
 Yes.

412
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,720
 I don't think Canada did either.

413
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,720
 I really.

414
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,520
 I think, like, I remember reading about that convention and loads of countries went over

415
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:45,400
 and they all basically went to this convention and said, right, everyone has to do exactly

416
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,520
 the same as we do in our country.

417
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,520
 I may all have thought that that's what was going to happen.

418
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,440
 And they all got there and they went, no, we're not going to do that.

419
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,000
 And they've actually most countries solve it, okay, we'll go for this kind of version,

420
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,280
 but like, place like Canada and America, we're now sticking with what we've got.

421
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,280
 Stop them.

422
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,280
 Yeah.

423
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,280
 That's very interesting.

424
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:09,240
 You know the amount of time that traffic lights are on amber.

425
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,360
 So they go red, red and amber, green and red.

426
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,560
 And when it's red, you have to stop.

427
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,040
 But when there's some amber there, you're supposed to stop.

428
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,520
 But if it's dangerous, then you can carry on going.

429
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,520
 You either have to stop or go really fast.

430
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:26,920
 It's the practical, what happens here.

431
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,680
 But the amount of time that lights down amber has changed and it's thanks to one Swedish

432
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,680
 guy who went to court.

433
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:37,200
 He got caught driving through a red light and he said, no, it was amber and they showed

434
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:41,720
 him the evidence and he was like, well, this is what happened.

435
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,640
 I was turning left, all right, whichever way it was in Sweden, but if it was England,

436
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,640
 they would be left.

437
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:50,600
 I was about to turn left and I could see it was amber, but I thought I wouldn't have time

438
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,600
 to stop.

439
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,600
 So I turned left.

440
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:57,440
 But in order to turn left, I had to slow down and it didn't take that into account.

441
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,400
 Like the amount of time is on amber.

442
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,400
 It's normally if you're going straight on and the amount of time that realistically you

443
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,400
 can stop.

444
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,400
 Right.

445
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,400
 But he was turning left.

446
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,400
 You have to slow down to turn.

447
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,400
 And he said, this wasn't fair.

448
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,840
 I won my ticket sorting and they did it and they changed the amount of time and now legally

449
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,840
 that's changed.

450
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:18,000
 I think that's changed about the EU now because he had time to slow down but not time to stop.

451
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 Yeah.

452
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 He was like, he was going.

453
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 See it was amber.

454
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,520
 He's like, so it's dangerous if I stopped.

455
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,520
 Yeah.

456
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,000
 So I'm going to have to keep going, but I need to turn left.

457
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,200
 So I do need to slow down and he just caught the red light and they said, no, you're done.

458
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,200
 He had a good lawyer.

459
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,200
 It's right.

460
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,200
 I'm sitting there.

461
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,200
 Bullshit.

462
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,200
 I believe it.

463
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,040
 If you can slow down enough to turn.

464
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,040
 No, I believe everywhere.

465
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,960
 I think that's right.

466
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:45,280
 You know how when you sit in a room, just staring at the wall, sitting in the car that's

467
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,600
 happening.

468
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,120
 You're in your dang cave.

469
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,120
 Yes.

470
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,640
 And a single shaft of light is falling across the room because there's any one window.

471
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,640
 And it's a sunny day and you can see the dust moats in the air.

472
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,640
 Yeah.

473
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,640
 Yeah, like that.

474
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,640
 It's nice, isn't it?

475
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,640
 Yeah.

476
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,160
 Well, there was a physicist, an Irish physicist in the 19th century called John Tindel who

477
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,680
 said, I want to know what's going on here and sort of study it.

478
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:11,120
 And he created special equipment to observe what that was in the air.

479
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:17,000
 So he reported that his breath didn't have any of that stuff in it, but air in the room

480
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 did.

481
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 Yeah.

482
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 Right.

483
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,280
 So he created all this, you know, sort of filter, air filters and stuff like that.

484
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:28,600
 And what he was gathering together was a big strut of evidence in support of germ theory

485
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,920
 of disease.

486
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:35,360
 So Lister, Joseph Lister was saying, I think, infection spreads through the air in microbial

487
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,360
 form.

488
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,360
 And lots of other scientists piled in and said, no, it doesn't.

489
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:45,160
 You know, a lot of them believed in spontaneous generation that life arises from nowhere.

490
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:49,640
 So this guy, John Tindel, was so angry at all these people criticizing germ theory that

491
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:56,680
 he spent seven years studying dust in the air and trying to grow microbes in it into a liquid

492
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,680
 broth.

493
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,200
 He did hundreds of experiments.

494
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,800
 I just think it's amazing this guy, because when did you say he was?

495
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,800
 Sorry.

496
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,800
 When was it?

497
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,800
 1870s, I think.

498
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,800
 Okay.

499
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,800
 Yeah.

500
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,800
 Did he make a delicious soup?

501
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,800
 Is that a recipe book we can get?

502
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,120
 He traveled all the way to the Alps.

503
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,120
 He was trying to prove.

504
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,480
 If air has no particles in it, you can't grow anything from that air.

505
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,480
 Nothing can be cultured.

506
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,160
 If you're using completely empty, you know, sterilized air, is it worth?

507
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:26,480
 He went to the Alps with 50 flask of broth, science in the 19th century was just great.

508
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,520
 And they were boiled and sealed broth tubes, right?

509
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,360
 And they were like beef, mutton, turnip, cucumber, just different kinds of broth.

510
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,320
 And he would open them up, and a bit of air gets in.

511
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,480
 And then you see if anything can be grown from that, you know, if anything in the air reacts

512
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,480
 with anything in the broth, that would mean that, you know, it proved sort of health proved

513
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,480
 in the way.

514
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,600
 Why, again, much like this guy who managed to get to the Caribbean on the free, like why

515
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,600
 did he have to go to the Alps?

516
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,760
 Could he just go outside and just feel empty mountain alpine air?

517
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,760
 Yeah.

518
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,840
 And what he thought was that the air would be a lot emptier there than in his home, for

519
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,840
 example.

520
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,160
 So when he opened stuff in his home, where people have been breathing out bacteria all day,

521
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,080
 he could grow stuff very easily when he opens up some broth.

522
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,960
 But doesn't that prove jump theory?

523
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,960
 Why does he need to prove it in the empty alpine air?

524
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,360
 Because he's saying that when you open this broth in empty air, nothing gets in.

525
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,520
 And that proves the difference between full air and empty air.

526
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,560
 Sorry, he didn't want anything to grow.

527
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,560
 Exactly.

528
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,560
 John Tyndall.

529
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:23,360
 It's so interesting, because ten years before, the exact same thing was done by Louis

530
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:30,240
 Paster, who basically was the person who did all the experiments with the broth in the

531
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,040
 Alps by my mom.

532
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:39,440
 Yeah, he was in a massive fight with a fellow French scientist who thought that things were

533
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,440
 spontaneously erupting within, you know, vats of food and so on.

534
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,840
 And he was saying, no, it was a rabie.

535
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,360
 Like literally everything you've just said is the exact same story of Louis Paster.

536
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,440
 I wonder if one of you's got the wrong name.

537
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,240
 I feel like that's the case.

538
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,320
 And I don't know who.

539
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,000
 The broth part of it seems very unlikely that two people are there.

540
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,280
 I think the people living in that little village all the time, I'm not another bloody scientist.

541
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,200
 It's more of 19th century time to have some element of broth to get your ground, to get

542
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,200
 your funding.

543
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,200
 Because check this out, Eddie.

544
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,200
 Oh, no.

545
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:16,240
 In 1864, in an amphitheater, a fielded peresian elites, he stood and he had a single shaft

546
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,160
 of light come down so that they could see all the dust moats in the air for him to show

547
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,560
 that it was surrounding us at all times.

548
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,800
 What did you wait for me to get to the end of my room?

549
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,920
 10 minute long bet.

550
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:33,760
 You were just leaping through your nose, looking concerned, looking fainly, like I know something,

551
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,760
 you don't know.

552
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,760
 Look on your face.

553
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,760
 Well, that does not the same.

554
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,760
 Did he bring the broth to the out?

555
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,760
 Yeah.

556
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,760
 Right.

557
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,760
 I think we need to go back and look on our nose.

558
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,000
 It's also like they just didn't communicate very well in the 19th century.

559
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,760
 If they'd had social media, they'd keep doing it in friends, just completely different

560
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,760
 fields.

561
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,760
 Yeah.

562
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,760
 Louis Pasteur.

563
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,760
 Yeah, Louis Pasteur.

564
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,760
 He's the guy who...

565
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,760
 Yeah, John Theory.

566
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,760
 John Theory.

567
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,760
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

568
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,760
 I think I saw this guy.

569
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,760
 I was never heard of this guy.

570
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,760
 Well, he was clearly...

571
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,760
 What?

572
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,760
 He was a plagiarist.

573
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,760
 He just ran about past days.

574
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,760
 No one else.

575
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,760
 In the UK, it's heard of this guy.

576
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,760
 I'm just going to do exactly the same thing.

577
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:15,760
 He's the only guy who spoke French.

578
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:25,200
 spoke French. Who was tin, was it? He was one of the leading prostitutes protestant reform.

579
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:45,280
 It wasn't he? You're thinking of a different tindal. And no, I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I was. I was. I was. I was. John Tindal Irish. Was it not one who was a rope player who married one of the royal family? Was it? Yeah, Mike Tindal. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. You know all the tindals. So I don't want to question it then. Mike Tindals work on Jamthier is unbelievable. There's there's obviously ASMR.

580
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:54,880
 Which is where we get very close to the microphones and we make little noises. Wake up. But that's that's very extremely popular, isn't it?

581
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:02,880
 I feel like it's got less, maybe it's more in place, but there's brown noise trend. I feel like it's become less trendy recently. Maybe. Anyway, I agree. I think it's less trendy than it used to be.

582
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:17,280
 We just hear about it less. Sorry to hear that. Anyway, this is desperately now on scrunching as paper. Oh, yeah, that's good stuff on here.

583
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:26,880
 If you want, for example, this is a thing for people to listen to. If you want to lose weight, there's a sound you can listen to that helps people in studies. It's help people lose weight. They eat substantially less.

584
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:34,880
 Okay. Here's one thing like white noise because Dan said it stops the internal monologue. If your internal monologue is saying I could do with another pie. Yeah.

585
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:43,680
 That it might stop you from thinking it's not bad, but no. Is it a, are we looking for a tone of noise or it's like a kind of thing? A kind of thing. So you know, it's like.

586
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:54,880
 It's, is it the exact opposite of the noise that an ice cream fan makes? So you can't hear the ice cream. It's the opposite of green sleeves. Yeah. Let's rewind.

587
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:10,880
 It's actually your own chewing. Okay. If you play into people's ears, the sound then supposedly it makes people feel the flavors more intensely of what they're eating as they eat it. So they feel fuller faster.

588
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:22,880
 Does it feel fuller if you feel taste the flavors more? Maybe. Yeah, I can imagine that your brain would feel like I had so much more stimulation there. I don't need any more.

589
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:30,880
 Like if you just scoff your food, you don't feel full straight away. Do you? Yeah. You're not tasting the flavors. But I would have thought it might be because people don't like the sound of people chewing.

590
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:42,880
 I mean, it makes me feel ill hearing someone. Yeah. So next time you have a dinner party, if you haven't quite cooked enough food, just, I'm just going to pop some music on it. Just, just have a loud chewing.

591
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:56,880
 Yeah, I've been to a restaurant where they gave you some, I don't remember what it was now, but it was some seafood and that they gave you headphones and played you the sound of the sea while you were eating it and sprayed sort of salt in your face.

592
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:06,880
 It was just a fat dark or something. Yeah. And was it, did they throw your lifeboat halfway through it? She's going down.

593
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:18,880
 She stood up on the table with my arms outstretched. My wife grabbed me around the waist. Don't take the restaurant door off its hinges. Your wife gets on.

594
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:28,880
 That melty cheese that you can basically get in a big old vat and with a squirty bit on the top and you press it and it just squirts all this disgusting goop on your on your nachos.

595
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:44,880
 That was invented by a guy called Frank Liberto and he actually died in 2017 and the San Antonio Express noted that it was the day before national nachos day that he died, which is a bit sad.

596
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,880
 Can't, but stupid not to hang on, isn't it?

597
00:25:48,880 --> 00:26:04,880
 He was like, he was like a lifetime member of the concession stand guild or something. Like in America, they have a big association of fast food concession companies and he was like one of the big big cheeses there.

598
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:18,880
 Now we work out why you were telling us that whole thing. You know how many people are called Bambi? Well, a lot.

599
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:30,880
 You think a lot of people are called Bambi? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I feel it's a very reality TV name. I feel like it's fewer than damn things, but more than you think.

600
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:40,880
 He's probably someone in the middle. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Widdly, I think you're right now. No, I think now. I don't know. No, just in the year after Bambi came out, that was the first year in American history where five Bambis were born.

601
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:46,880
 It's a very pretty old Bambi choice if you've seen Bambi. You know, it's a kind of some nice name. But it's a...

602
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,880
 Why is it an old Bambi choice? Bambi is a great character, very lovable who doesn't die.

603
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,880
 But Bambi goes through a lot. I'd say along the way. No spoilers for once.

604
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:05,880
 Yeah, but don't get to it after Bambi's mother is all I'm saying. But this happens obviously with loads and loads of films. And so there was recently a new version of Cinderella out. Oh, yeah.

605
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:12,880
 There are now a hundred women ish in the in America who will be in their mid 70s who are all named Cinderella.

606
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:20,880
 Mm hmm. Okay. Yeah. Really? Yeah. That's just a surprising name. Yeah. I don't mind it. I don't mind it at all. It's just interesting.

607
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:28,880
 Cindy, you just go Cindy for short. I suppose you would. Do you remember the name Walter Plinge?

608
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,880
 Walter Plinge. I don't think so. Feel like I would. No, I don't think so.

609
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:36,880
 So we've mentioned the name Walter Plinge once before in 11 years. And I'm really disappointed you guys didn't recall it.

610
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:43,880
 I'm really annoyed. This is the British Alan Smithy. Oh, okay. And Alan Smithy is...

611
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:49,880
 It's a synonym that a person associated with a film could be a writer, director, actor who doesn't want to be associated with the film.

612
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:54,880
 So Smithy is the name. And that's what goes on the credits director by Alan Smithy.

613
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,880
 Actually, it was Martin Scorsese, but he's so embarrassed to have done the nutty professor five.

614
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:04,880
 They just take his name off the credits, et cetera. Walter Plinge is the British version.

615
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,880
 But there's another version of it, which is an actor who is mentioned extensively in a play, but doesn't turn up.

616
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:17,880
 But you don't want the audience to know that. Guadal. So starring Walter Plinge as Guadal would be a perfect example.

617
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:23,880
 I'm like, let's not reveal that Goddo doesn't spoil the alert. Turn up in waiting for Goddo.

618
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,880
 You'd say Walter Plinge. But now we've spoiled it.

619
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:32,880
 Yes, I'm afraid no one will be able to enjoy it. Not when they ever really did wait for Goddo again.

620
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,880
 Have you guys heard of the music festival Rocklet?

621
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,880
 I love it. It's a rock and reclet festival in the Alps every year.

622
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,880
 You should explain what reclet is actually, because I don't think I knew 10 years ago what it was.

623
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,880
 It's a sort of cheese thing, isn't it?

624
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:54,880
 I thought it was like a fondue. No, it's like so. They give you a big lump of cheese, and they put some tea lights under it.

625
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,880
 And then it melts and then you kind of scrape it off the cheese as it's melting and you can eat it with your pickles and stuff.

626
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:04,880
 It's like a cheese cabab. Sure. Yeah. No, it is. Yeah. Yeah. Like one of those big elephant feet.

627
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,880
 A lot of pot areas of London. They don't have cabab shops with the elephant legs in the window.

628
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,880
 They've just got a whack and great fondue and a very big tea light over the big thing.

629
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,880
 Yeah. That's what we call Rocklet. Rock and reclet.

630
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:25,880
 And this year's lineup, the genres include heavy shamanic doom, dark folk and post-indeed dream shougay's rock, none of which I understand.

631
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:31,880
 Sounds great, but they're all bands. They're all genres. They're all genres. They're all genres played by bands.

632
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:38,880
 You really would only go for the cheese, wouldn't you? I love you. I don't know what reclet is.

633
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:47,880
 Probably the most famous thing like that is these guys called Jim and Jim and Jim actually.

634
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:54,880
 There's two guys called Jim who had been twins and were separated at birth and adopted.

635
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:00,880
 And it turned out they both married someone called Linda. They both got divorced from Linda and remarried someone called Betty.

636
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:09,880
 One had named their first bond child James Allen and the other one James Allen with two L's. So almost the same. Each of them had a dog called toy.

637
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:18,880
 They drove the same car, same color of car, went to the same beach for the holidays and had the same cigarettes and beer.

638
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:24,880
 And this was a thing that happened in the 70s and it was quite famous at the time. I think people might remember it from the newspapers.

639
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:33,880
 And I've checked some of the old newspaper archives and I saw an interview with them and because this is all true, but obviously it's just a coincidence.

640
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:39,880
 And it's just the fact that if you've got 300 million people in America, a lot of these things are going to show up eventually.

641
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,880
 Can I ask quickly, why are they both called Jim?

642
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,880
 Well, actually, yeah, that's a good point because they've been adopted.

643
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:55,880
 So when they got adopted, they were given new names. Okay, it wasn't like them. It wasn't like they were taken away from their mother because she said I'll call them Jim and Jim.

644
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:03,880
 I apologise to anyone who was thinking that for the very start of that anecdote. I couldn't think about anything else.

645
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:10,880
 Yeah, saying the same thing. Anyway, these two gyms, I've read an interview with them and it was amazing.

646
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:20,880
 When this came out that this had happened, they became a little bit famous. And what happened was a load of psychologists got hold of them and started testing them.

647
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:26,880
 And they were tested, but they said 10 hours a day for six days where they were putting separate cells.

648
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,880
 Oh, what? Well, they've been tested on for people trying to see if they were psychically linked or something.

649
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:43,880
 Also rounds also rounds on like pop music sports. It's so weird. Like they would they would have like things testing their brainwaves and they sit them there for an hour with nothing happening.

650
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:50,880
 And then someone would come in and go, Jim. And then they would see if the other person's brain wave spikes as well and stuff like that.

651
00:31:50,880 --> 00:32:05,880
 And did it turn out they both by the whole time going, this is bullshit. And everyone was like, oh, well, they are psychic. Yeah, what came out was actually there was lots of differences between them that had never come up in the newspapers because the newspapers all the looks at the things that were all the same interest.

652
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:17,880
 Although you say two brothers with the same name wouldn't happen. You know John Nash of beautiful mind Russell Crowe fame, who was the mathematician game theory mathematician who was then played by Russell Crowe more famously.

653
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:22,880
 He had a son more famously than himself playing himself, you mean? Yeah, yeah, okay.

654
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:28,880
 He had a son called John with one woman and then he had another son with his wife, Alicia, a different woman.

655
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:38,880
 And this is when he was becoming schizophrenic and he was in an institution, I think at that point. And Alicia said, I'm going to wait to name this child because I really want John to have an input.

656
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:48,880
 So she waited a year. This child had no name. He came out of the institution. She said, I've wasted what do you want to call your son? What did he call him?

657
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:54,880
 John, John. John Nash, two sons, both called John.

658
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,880
 Brains doesn't get you everywhere, does it?

659
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:06,880
 No, that's the George woman, of course, had just died. He has. He had six George's and a George, a George, a George.

660
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:16,880
 As well as the toaster, of course. Yeah, who he thought of as a son. He was asked that in an interview and he said, well, once you've been in a ring with Muhammad Ali,

661
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:24,880
 you've got a sonny list and all the other boxing grades and taken punches to the head, you'd name all your kids the same.

662
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:40,880
 There was a Scarborough football club in the 1970s had two players called Harry Dunn and Harry A Dunn. But the truth is they were both called Harry Dunn and they added a fictitious middle initial to one of them to make sure that everyone knew who did not have a middle name.

663
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:48,880
 The weird rarity with no middle name. Yeah, he didn't have a middle name. Okay, yeah. Did the other one because they should have gone with the other one.

664
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:58,880
 Well, the other one might have done, but he was really famously the other one. So they couldn't change his name. So they brought in a new Harry Dunn who was a lot younger and they said, well, can't call you Harry Dunn because there's already one.

665
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,880
 And he said, well, I don't have a middle name. And they said, I will just put the first letter we could think of.

666
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:11,880
 That's like the lesser Andy Murray having to call himself Andrew Hunter Murray, isn't it? Because it's like everyone knows the other Andy Murray. So you've got to call yourself something else.

667
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,880
 Cost of the quick.

668
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,880
 Never messes.

669
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,880
 Not lesser anymore.

670
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,880
 Okay. I think you've overtaken him.

671
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:21,880
 Thank you so much for that incredibly belated and half-hearted.

672
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,880
 Incredibly belated.

673
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:31,880
 You guys are familiar with the Canadian artist, the weakened.

674
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,880
 Yes.

675
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:41,880
 The weakened dropped. He used to be called the weakened. Yeah. But they dropped the E because there was already a Canadian band called the weakened.

676
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,880
 Really.

677
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:46,880
 And we could never have had this running joke on the podcast.

678
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,880
 We could never. We could never.

679
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,880
 The podcast could have been weakened without.

680
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,880
 I actually have a pop culture facts.

681
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,880
 You know Taylor Swift.

682
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:01,880
 Did you look. She looked her page.

683
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:09,880
 There's a guy called Taylor Lautner, who is in twilight and he went out with Taylor Swift.

684
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:16,880
 So if they'd got married, they would have both been Taylor Lautner, but they didn't get married. He ended up getting married to a nurse.

685
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:21,880
 He's now called Taylor Lautner, who was called Taylor as well. She was also called Taylor. He's got a type.

686
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:28,880
 He's got a type in its Taylor. Wow. Was it Evelyn War, who was married to an Evelyn War? Yeah.

687
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,880
 Well, yeah, yeah, they called them Evelyn and Evelyn. That's right.

688
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:45,880
