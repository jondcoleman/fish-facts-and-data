1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:16,380
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:17,980
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

4
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,820
 a weekly podcast coming to you

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,580
 from multiple undisclosed locations across the globe.

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,620
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

7
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,820
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray

8
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:28,940
 and James Harkin.

9
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,080
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,720
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

11
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,720
 and in a particular order, here we go.

12
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,960
 Starting with fact number one, that is Anna.

13
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,800
 - My fact this week is that in 1950,

14
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,820
 a ballet was performed at the Waldorf Hotel

15
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:49,140
 where the main characters were protons, electrons,

16
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,040
 neutrons and a Geiger counter.

17
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,160
 - Lovely.

18
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,160
 I have a question.

19
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,560
 I reckon it's hard to see an electron

20
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,160
 even if you're on the front row,

21
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,440
 you're gonna struggle to see an electron doing a plie.

22
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,320
 - Have you seen those ballet sort of little telecopies

23
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,160
 you sometimes get at the ballet

24
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,280
 where you put a coin in the slot and you can get a thing out?

25
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,560
 It's like that, but everyone gets a--

26
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,400
 - Electron microscope.

27
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,240
 - Electron microscope.

28
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,820
 - 15 million times magnifying, yeah.

29
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,660
 - Got it.

30
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:16,480
 - Yeah, everyone had that.

31
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,840
 It was a very expensive place put on.

32
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,520
 No, this sits on one of those things

33
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,680
 and they were human sized, played by humans.

34
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,600
 And this was reported in Time Magazine

35
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,920
 and it was a story that the founder

36
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,200
 of the Atomic Energy Association of Great Britain

37
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,640
 who was a woman called Muriel Howarth

38
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,720
 was putting on isotopia, which was a ballet

39
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,560
 and the article goes on to describe or review it

40
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,000
 saying it was 13 bosomy women girating gracefully

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,120
 an ample electron in black lace wound her way

42
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,680
 around two matrons labeled proton and neutron.

43
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,880
 I see because like an electron is like 2000 times smaller

44
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,060
 than a neutron.

45
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,760
 So they didn't get like a very small person

46
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,320
 or a child to be the electron and--

47
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,920
 - It wasn't to scale, no.

48
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,520
 - I'm not sure the casting process was as scientific

49
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,360
 as you would like, James, for this.

50
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,320
 I'm just getting a vibe that you would have some notes

51
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,640
 if you were sitting in as director.

52
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,240
 - I would have notes and they would say,

53
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,120
 James, you can be the electron 'cause you can so negative.

54
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,320
 - It sounds amazing.

55
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,640
 I can't tell even from the review whether it was good

56
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,400
 or not because the person who wrote the review.

57
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,360
 Well, the person says the 250 wrapped ladies,

58
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,680
 that means it's good so far,

59
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,720
 and a dozen faintly bored gentlemen.

60
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,160
 Faintly bored is a stupid thing to add in a review.

61
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,360
 - Sorry, can I also add what you said there

62
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,820
 didn't quite make sense unless you know

63
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,960
 that the word wrapped was spelt R-A-P-T.

64
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,880
 So it wasn't 250 women who are wrapped in,

65
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,840
 like, you know, but were wrapped possibly.

66
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,920
 - They burst out of their gift wrapping

67
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,640
 as the grand finale.

68
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,320
 - And sorry, Dan, when Dan said faintly bored gentlemen,

69
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,480
 he meant bored B-O-R-E-D,

70
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,520
 and not that they were made out of plywood.

71
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,360
 - You see what I mean, it's a confusing review.

72
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,120
 - It's hard, yeah, it's very hard.

73
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,660
 I don't think it's been restaged many times.

74
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,500
 - No.

75
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,160
 - And she wanted it after its debut

76
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,640
 to play at the Albert Hall, which I don't think it did.

77
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,440
 And she said, she's a brilliant woman, Mural Howard.

78
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,960
 I'm sure we're gonna talk more about her now.

79
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,720
 She said she wanted it to be at the Albert Hall,

80
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,120
 so they would have room for all the 92 transmutations

81
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,680
 of the atom, which is like the director's cut version,

82
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,680
 so ambitious.

83
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,480
 And she set up loads of atomic bodies, Mural Howard.

84
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,000
 And this might have been when she was the Institute

85
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,720
 for Atomic Information, or it might have been

86
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,240
 its previous guys, the Ladies' Atomic Energy Club,

87
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,200
 which just sounds like such a...

88
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,840
 - It sounds like a Richard Usman book.

89
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,680
 - It does.

90
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,160
 - It sounds like a cute novel.

91
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,840
 - It really does, yeah.

92
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,760
 - Did you guys know she did a follow-up to this?

93
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,320
 That there was a musical piece, a piano concerto

94
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,120
 that she did as a follow-up to Isotopia.

95
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,960
 Yeah, it was called Atomica.

96
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,640
 And the review of it says it chiefly consisted

97
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,400
 of loud, heavy chords, which indicated atomic bombs

98
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,360
 and springing, tinkling passages,

99
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,080
 which reflected the extreme surprise

100
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,600
 and alarm of the human race.

101
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,440
 - It sounds like what the response would be,

102
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,160
 but not a great advert, 'cause the whole point of it

103
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,280
 was that she was trying to tell the public

104
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,920
 how great atomic energy was.

105
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:21,920
 So she was employed by Atomic Energy to be its PR man.

106
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,840
 And the aim of this society was to lead women

107
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,000
 out of the kitchen and into the atomic age.

108
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,480
 So she particularly wanted to target women,

109
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,560
 which is why there were all these wrapped women.

110
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,800
 And they're mildly bored husbands, apparently.

111
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,160
 But she was amazing.

112
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,760
 - Yeah, extraordinary. - A self-sort completely.

113
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,520
 She was inspired by reading this Nobel Prize winners book,

114
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,440
 guy called Frederick Soddy.

115
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,720
 And she was inspired by his statement

116
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,640
 that we could transform a desert continent,

117
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,520
 thaw the frozen poles and make the world

118
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,120
 one smiling garden of Eden using atomic energy,

119
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,480
 which weirdly we have now done and it's not that good.

120
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,440
 But yeah, and she taught herself all about the atom

121
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,520
 and then tried to spread the good word.

122
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,560
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

123
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,280
 And atomic gardening was the big thing,

124
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,680
 which is probably why isotopia was so much about food.

125
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,640
 It's like early GM,

126
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,800
 but it's incredibly unscientific ways of doing GM.

127
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,680
 Basically, you plant a load of crops in a circle,

128
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,120
 you put a radioactive source in the middle.

129
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,080
 - When you say radioactive source, sorry,

130
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,480
 we're spelling that-- - Yes.

131
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,440
 - 'Cause that's genuine possible confusion, isn't it?

132
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,520
 I think. - Yeah, I suppose so.

133
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,320
 Yeah, a source of radiation.

134
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,160
 Does that clear it up?

135
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,000
 Not much.

136
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,200
 Anyway, there's some radioactive stuff

137
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,680
 in the middle of the pie chart

138
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,240
 and then all the plants near it--

139
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,120
 - Was this a physical pie? - Or was this like a--

140
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,520
 - Gee, was--

141
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,720
 - Sorry, go on, Andy.

142
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,360
 - Yeah, no one else got any amusing homophones.

143
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,280
 They wanna bust out.

144
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,880
 - When you say homophones.

145
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,720
 - Oh my God.

146
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,400
 (all laughing)

147
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,440
 So you put your gamma radiation right in the middle,

148
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,480
 and the plants that are nearest to the seedlings

149
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,280
 get completely blasted and they just die.

150
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,440
 And then the ones further out get tumors.

151
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,200
 And the ones further out than that,

152
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,960
 on the outer edge of the pie chart,

153
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,520
 get a load of mutations.

154
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,760
 And those mutations might be useful in some ways.

155
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,720
 So they might make the plant stronger

156
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,920
 or they might make it more resistant

157
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,400
 to particular kinds of blight.

158
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,240
 And you just do thousands of experiments

159
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,480
 and they produce thousands of new varieties of plants,

160
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,920
 some of which I think are still in use today.

161
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,480
 The mutations actually worked for agriculture.

162
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,040
 - Absolutely, like the peppermint oil,

163
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,000
 any peppermint oil which you have today,

164
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,840
 which you might think,

165
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,680
 "Well, I don't really have much peppermint oil,"

166
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,880
 but actually it's in loads of foods that you get

167
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,760
 as like a very minor ingredient

168
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,000
 that was invented by atomic gardening.

169
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,640
 It's in toothpaste and stuff like that, for instance.

170
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,720
 But she became famous for inventing

171
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,360
 the world's first atomic peanut.

172
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,200
 Didn't she?

173
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,880
 - Yeah, she made this radioactive peanut,

174
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,880
 which germinated in four days and grew two feet tall,

175
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,600
 which apparently is quite big for a peanut.

176
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,200
 That's a peanut plant, not the peanuts.

177
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,200
 - Yeah, 'cause the peanut itself,

178
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,400
 disappointingly, as I read in the reviews,

179
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,520
 was the size of an almond.

180
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,360
 - Yes, yeah.

181
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,200
 - Which is like--

182
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,840
 - That's a huge peanut.

183
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,400
 In the peanut world, that's big.

184
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,680
 Yeah, absolutely.

185
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,200
 That's double or triple a normal peanut.

186
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,160
 - It is quite good.

187
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,000
 But you do get jumbo peanuts these days,

188
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,080
 which I don't think are irradiated.

189
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,880
 - I want a peanut the size of a person,

190
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,000
 but sorry, ruined it.

191
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,600
 (laughing)

192
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,840
 - If you look at all the pictures

193
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,200
 in the newspapers at the time,

194
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,280
 she's there, a picture of her with her peanut,

195
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,880
 which looks a bit like an almond,

196
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,160
 'cause obviously the pictures aren't great either,

197
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,920
 so you can't really see what she's doing.

198
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,360
 But that was when she first really got in the newspapers

199
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,200
 and became big.

200
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,240
 And then she started trying to do all of these

201
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,520
 publicity stunts of which the ballet was won.

202
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,680
 And one of them was she cooked a roast dinner,

203
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,840
 English roast dinner of beef, vegetables,

204
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,760
 Yorkshire pudding, potatoes, and onions.

205
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,400
 But the potatoes and onions were three years old,

206
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,080
 so they'd been irradiated and they were absolutely fine

207
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,560
 after three years, that was her opinion.

208
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,400
 - It's brilliant.

209
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,240
 - It's so good.

210
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,440
 That must have been revolutionary,

211
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,760
 like time travel cuisine.

212
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,560
 - Yeah, it must have been amazing,

213
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,560
 but apparently it didn't taste of anything.

214
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,400
 - Right, okay.

215
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,840
 - 'Cause once you'd irradiated them

216
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,160
 and kept them for three years,

217
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,640
 any kind of taste in this potato or onion

218
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,440
 had just disappeared completely.

219
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,840
 If you're cooking with onions,

220
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,480
 and they've often been in the back of your pantry

221
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,760
 for a bit of time,

222
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,440
 I mean, do you need to irradiate it

223
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,760
 to serve three-year-old onions?

224
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,520
 I reckon I've probably tried to cook myself

225
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,440
 an onion verging on that.

226
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,480
 You know, and you get the soft bits off,

227
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,120
 and sometimes there's a bit that's salvageable.

228
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,880
 I'm not sure you needed to go through all of that trouble.

229
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,800
 Do you know what I mean?

230
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,000
 - I know exactly what you mean,

231
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,480
 having known you for 15 years.

232
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,880
 - And never come for dinner at my house,

233
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,680
 despite multiple invitations.

234
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,200
 - Another cool thing that she did is that

235
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,840
 she put a message out saying,

236
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,840
 "I need people to help me with this."

237
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,200
 And if you want to get involved,

238
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,040
 get in contact,

239
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,440
 and if anyone did get in contact,

240
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,640
 she sent them seeds through the post.

241
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,640
 And to encourage it,

242
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,480
 she launched the Muriel Howarth Peanut Prize

243
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,200
 to the best mutant things each year.

244
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,720
 But we don't actually know whether or not

245
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,720
 anyone was awarded it,

246
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,280
 because again, it was so hard to find these mutants.

247
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,120
 - Really?

248
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,960
 - Yeah.

249
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,800
 - Wow.

250
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,640
 - I didn't know that.

251
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,360
 - Either that or someone created a mutant plant

252
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,480
 so vicious, it ate all of them.

253
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,680
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

254
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,760
 - The evidence was destroyed.

255
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,480
 She used to carry a potato around in her pocket.

256
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,560
 That wasn't just any potato.

257
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,720
 It was an irradiated potato.

258
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,560
 - Did she?

259
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,400
 (laughing)

260
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,240
 - What?

261
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,200
 - That was a publicity stunt.

262
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,280
 And I-

263
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,680
 - It's not very good publicity if it's in your pocket,

264
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,240
 unless you have a transparent pocket.

265
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,760
 - Well, she had it very obvious,

266
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,040
 and she used to open with a chat-up line,

267
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,440
 "You know, I am not just pleased to see you.

268
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,840
 It's actually an irradiated potato in my pocket."

269
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,680
 (laughing)

270
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,520
 - So, good retention.

271
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,800
 - Have I ever said that in the old days

272
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,840
 of crown green bowling in Lancashire,

273
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,280
 this was at the turn of the 20th century,

274
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,520
 the bowlers would often keep a jacket potato

275
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,840
 in their pockets?

276
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,200
 - Like a hot water bottle?

277
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,040
 - Why?

278
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,880
 - Exactly, yeah.

279
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,720
 - Oh, wow.

280
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,760
 - So it would be to keep your hands warm,

281
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,640
 so you'd have a jacket potato in your pocket,

282
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,080
 and whenever your hands got cold,

283
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,640
 'cause it's always cold in Lancashire,

284
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,600
 you would put your hands in your pocket,

285
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,880
 warm them up, that would be good for the game,

286
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,360
 and then when there was a break in the game,

287
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,720
 you could eat the jacket potato.

288
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,560
 - Wow.

289
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,840
 - There must have been a lot of either, A,

290
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,640
 amusing mishaps where people accidentally threw

291
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,240
 the potato along the pitch,

292
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,000
 or B, a lot of arrests for suspected masturbation.

293
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,800
 (laughing)

294
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,960
 No, it's, we know the potato's in your other pocket,

295
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,960
 but we know that.

296
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,160
 (laughing)

297
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,760
 Can we say on how, there is a fantastic source,

298
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,360
 if you do want to read more about atomic gardening,

299
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,920
 there's a website called atomicgardening.com.

300
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,640
 I think it's run by someone called Paige Johnson.

301
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,480
 - Yes, that's right.

302
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,440
 - Who is kind of the,

303
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,640
 I don't know if she's the official or unofficial,

304
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,520
 but she is the historian on this subject.

305
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,160
 It's so interesting.

306
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,000
 - Definitely.

307
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,200
 - She's just kind of found everything

308
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,560
 about Howarth over the years, and yeah, it's very cool.

309
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,400
 - Yeah.

310
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,320
 - And in fact, one thing she found

311
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,920
 that I couldn't find where she got it from,

312
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,480
 she wrote that Muriel Howarth also patented

313
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,360
 an early picture and sound recording device

314
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,880
 called the talky phone.

315
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,720
 - Did she?

316
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,560
 - Oh.

317
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,400
 - Yeah, she did.

318
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,240
 - She was extraordinary.

319
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,080
 She was a science fiction writer as well.

320
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,920
 She was putting these concertos together.

321
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,720
 She was an all-rounder.

322
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,800
 And I thought the story was gonna end,

323
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,240
 and this is part of the bad branding of nuclear power,

324
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,440
 that, oh, she would have got really ill

325
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,200
 off the back of this and eventually died,

326
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,600
 and that's why we don't do it anymore,

327
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,720
 but that didn't happen.

328
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,960
 This was safe.

329
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,520
 This was safe for her. - I was wondering, Dan,

330
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,840
 do you think that she was so prolific

331
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,760
 because she'd had a bit of radiation in her body?

332
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,380
 Maybe there was a big circle of Muriel Howarth's

333
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,320
 with a radioactive source in the middle,

334
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,280
 and she was just at the right position

335
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,800
 where she got the right blast of radiation,

336
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,280
 and it made her a superhero.

337
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,320
 - That's so exciting.

338
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,780
 I hadn't considered that,

339
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,600
 and that's all I'm gonna take away from this show now.

340
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,680
 - So what's happened to all the other Muriel Howarths

341
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,320
 who are kind of weird, mutant-formed,

342
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,160
 gigantic, or minuscule green?

343
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,160
 - She's eaten them.

344
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,760
 She's eaten them as something to provide flavor

345
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,000
 next to these awful potatoes and onions.

346
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,160
 - They are the bad guys in the Muriel Howarth comic book.

347
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,320
 - Oh, that's such a good idea.

348
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,680
 Wait, and it's called, sorry,

349
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,160
 the comic book is called The Ladies' Atomic Energy Club,

350
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,720
 and it's about all the ladies are Muriel Howarth

351
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,880
 who've been replicated, and they've got different skills.

352
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,120
 One of them's got 19 legs.

353
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,680
 - One writes piano concertos,

354
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,520
 the other writes science fiction novels.

355
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,200
 - Can I just say, it seems like quite often

356
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,760
 we come up with these brilliant ideas,

357
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,120
 but no one at Hollywood has gotten in touch with us yet,

358
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,760
 so maybe they're getting our email wrong or something,

359
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,120
 but it's podcast@qi.com if anyone wants to give us

360
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,200
 a million quits about that.

361
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,040
 - I think that's true.

362
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,800
 I think maybe they assume that we've got them in development

363
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,200
 through our own, obviously, massive production company,

364
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,800
 and they just think, oh, well, those guys have thought

365
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,520
 of whatever stupid thing we've come up with this week.

366
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:44,920
 This was all kind of the pro atomic energy movement,

367
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,400
 wasn't it, saying, actually,

368
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,160
 this thing was invented for war.

369
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,280
 It's very, very powerful, but it can be used for peace.

370
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,720
 It can provide electricity and power that's much cleaner,

371
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,600
 doesn't cause carbon emissions, all that,

372
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,120
 and I just find it interesting.

373
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,720
 I had no idea how big the early movement was,

374
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,120
 so I read a great interview with a,

375
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,520
 she's a poet, actually, called Deborah Greger,

376
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,720
 and she grew up in a place called Hanford, Washington,

377
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,680
 which is where the Manhattan Project was partly based.

378
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,440
 It was where the first plutonium reactor

379
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,320
 in the world was cited, right?

380
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,440
 And it was such a culture of pro atomic energy.

381
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,400
 High school football team was called the Richland Bombers.

382
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,880
 The cheerleaders for the football team

383
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,080
 had a four foot high nuclear bomb painted

384
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,200
 in the school colors, which they would dance around

385
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,720
 at halftime.

386
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,360
 And this is so cool.

387
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,120
 Once a month, her dad came back from work

388
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,840
 with a case, right, special suitcase,

389
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,680
 and it had two glass bottles in it,

390
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,960
 and his job was to fill the bottles with urine

391
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,400
 and leave them out on the front doorstep.

392
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,760
 - Oh, really?

393
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,880
 - And it was so he could be tested for any,

394
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,320
 if he'd had too much radiation exposure,

395
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,440
 at his job at the power plant.

396
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,840
 - So was there a postman, specifically,

397
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,600
 whose job was to come and collect two vials of urine?

398
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,000
 - I think it may be milkman, though.

399
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,400
 Because you've got the space on,

400
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,360
 if you've dropped two bottles of milk off,

401
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,840
 you've got a space for two urine bottles.

402
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,080
 - Yep, that's it.

403
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,960
 And the milk fairy, the urine fairy, comes around.

404
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,280
 - Yeah, you don't--

405
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,720
 - You don't want to mix up those orders.

406
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,560
 - Yeah, you don't want to.

407
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,840
 - Hang on, I've submitted the full-fat milk

408
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,280
 to the testing facility.

409
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,320
 (laughing)

410
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,120
 - What's up, my colleagues?

411
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,700
 (upbeat music)

412
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:21,160
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two,

413
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,960
 and that is Andy.

414
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,200
 My fact is that, in 1340, at the beginning

415
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,520
 of the Hundred Years' War,

416
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,600
 Edward III challenged King Philip VI of France

417
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,120
 to settle who was the rifle heir to the French throne

418
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,920
 by exposing themselves to hungry lions.

419
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,000
 (laughing)

420
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,640
 - Now, let's go through these words.

421
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,780
 Exposing yourself, can you define that, please?

422
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,280
 (laughing)

423
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,520
 - What a good point, what a good point.

424
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,800
 Sorry, you would basically put yourself in a room

425
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,320
 with a hungry lion, or a cage, or whatever.

426
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,080
 And the idea, obviously,

427
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,840
 a lion will never attack a true king.

428
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,880
 So this was like just a great acid test

429
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,240
 for who's the real king, let's find out.

430
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,960
 - Has anyone told the lion this?

431
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,400
 (laughing)

432
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,440
 - Well, exactly, it's so weird.

433
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,880
 - That is amazing, I wonder, at this stage,

434
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,680
 it's a little bit like the Cold War,

435
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,720
 where you've got two people

436
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,840
 who could mutually kill each other.

437
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,400
 You know, if Philip calls his bluff,

438
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,680
 then they're both dead.

439
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,840
 'Cause they both have to go and stand in front of lions,

440
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,680
 and they're both dead.

441
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,480
 - You're right, and it is lion's plural,

442
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,640
 so it feels like there's gonna be one lion for each of them.

443
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,080
 - Maybe they believe, I think maybe they both go in

444
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,680
 with one lion, and then the lion will have to attack

445
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,160
 one of them first, and then the other one just runs for it.

446
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,840
 Right, it's me, I'm the king, I'm the king.

447
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,080
 (laughing)

448
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,400
 Your servants will try and sneakily rub him with meat

449
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,280
 before you go in, so that's the game as well.

450
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,440
 - Do you think they did that thing

451
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,880
 where boys used to hide their willy in their bum cracks

452
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,080
 so that the lion couldn't see it?

453
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:54,160
 I don't think the lion is going for the penis, per se.

454
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,200
 - Anna, what do you think the costume choices are for this?

455
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,040
 Why are you...

456
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,080
 (laughing)

457
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,360
 - Oh my goodness, they're exposing themselves to the lions.

458
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,360
 Wait, sorry.

459
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,760
 - I'm sorry, I don't think that's traditionally

460
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,000
 where you put it where you hide it in your bum crack.

461
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,840
 I'm sorry.

462
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,640
 - This is when you're pretending,

463
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,800
 well, I don't know, 'cause I'm not a man,

464
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,200
 but when you're pretending to have a vagina,

465
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,760
 don't you hide it in your bum crack?

466
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,960
 - Between your legs, yeah, I would say more like that.

467
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,040
 - Between your legs was a normal traditional phrase.

468
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,880
 - Yeah.

469
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,720
 (laughing)

470
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,560
 - Anna.

471
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,600
 - You don't actually tuck it in inside your anus.

472
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,920
 (laughing)

473
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,480
 - Can we please get back to the 100 years ago?

474
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,280
 - I'm going to imagine Philip going,

475
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,440
 all right, Edward, fine, we're gonna do it.

476
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,360
 Fine, we're gonna do it.

477
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,200
 Where's the lion?

478
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,960
 It's in that room, fine, okay.

479
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,480
 And then Edward goes, okay, pats off.

480
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,760
 Penis in bum crack.

481
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,120
 (laughing)

482
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,120
 - Can you imagine if we had BBC live news coverage back there?

483
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,520
 Well, they're both in the room.

484
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,440
 (laughing)

485
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,560
 King Edward appears to be doing

486
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,760
 the most curious thing he's kinda tucking his,

487
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,400
 pushing his penis into his anus.

488
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,680
 (laughing)

489
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,160
 Anna, Anna.

490
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,760
 - I don't know what I've done and I'm so sorry.

491
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,280
 - I'm sorry, this is horrible.

492
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,280
 Right, can we get back to the horrific conflict

493
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,520
 which killed thousands and, you know, lasted a century?

494
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,760
 - I just got a quick question.

495
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,120
 Did anyone find where this was an idea

496
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:08,960
 that came from, the idea of those?

497
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,800
 - Yes, sorry.

498
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,600
 Well, it's just a traditional belief of King Lee,

499
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,040
 you know, you're chosen by God.

500
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,960
 So that this, I should say, this fact came in.

501
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,960
 It was based on a fact that was sent by Daniel Parrish

502
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,640
 'cause he heard us talking about scroffula

503
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,880
 and he has done a lot of research into that

504
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,600
 and there's an academic treatise called

505
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,880
 The Royal Touch in Early Modern England by Stephen Brogan

506
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,200
 and both of them did touching for scroffula.

507
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,040
 - Yeah.

508
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,240
 - Both Edward the Third and Philip the Sixth

509
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,120
 touched people who had scroffula

510
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,240
 and hopefully they'd be cured.

511
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,640
 You know, that was the idea of Monarchs

512
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,880
 had the power to do that.

513
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,000
 - Yeah.

514
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,320
 - And that was another of the elements of the challenge

515
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,480
 was that Edward also challenged Philip the Sixth.

516
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,440
 He said, "Look, we can either have trial by combat,

517
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,520
 "we can expose ourselves to lions,

518
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,960
 "or we can have a touch off

519
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,760
 "and we'll just touch as many people

520
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,800
 "as we can for scroffula and whoever wins,

521
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,280
 "who cures the most people, they're the true King of France."

522
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,120
 - Yeah.

523
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,480
 - So it's a way of avoiding this whole war.

524
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,480
 You know, we've got a big dispute

525
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,320
 about who should be in charge of France.

526
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,280
 Let's find out.

527
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,520
 And these were the methods that were proposed.

528
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,240
 - And did Philip the Sixth turn them all down

529
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,280
 and say, "I'd rather just do more than 100 years more."

530
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,600
 - Yeah, he didn't go for it,

531
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,360
 which implies that he sort of knew maybe actually

532
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,920
 he shouldn't be King of France.

533
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,760
 - Yeah, or maybe they should have a King of France

534
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,720
 who doesn't think that lions are just gonna randomly

535
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,520
 not attack you because you're a king.

536
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,320
 (laughing)

537
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,480
 But yeah, 100 years war.

538
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,880
 England being France, more than 100 years.

539
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,920
 I think that's a classic QI thing, right?

540
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,440
 - 116.

541
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,080
 - We're talking roughly. - 116 years.

542
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:37,320
 But basically, England owned loads of bits of France

543
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,640
 and there was a big old fight

544
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,160
 about how much they should own

545
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,800
 and how much they shouldn't own.

546
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,640
 Is that right?

547
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,600
 - A lot of people in France thought none

548
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,040
 and a lot of people in England thought some.

549
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,880
 - Who actually is England and who is France here?

550
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,240
 Lots of the French dukes sided with the English crown.

551
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,200
 It's all very, it's very confusing.

552
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,600
 - In a lot of ways, France wasn't really

553
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,520
 a coalesced nation until it was over.

554
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,480
 And my theory is that the whole of the 100 years war

555
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,520
 was just about wine

556
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,400
 because it was triggered when Philip the Sixth confiscated

557
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,560
 Aquitaine, which is region that was owned by the English,

558
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,720
 confiscated it from Edward the Third.

559
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,440
 So it was in Gascony and Gascony was crucial to England

560
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,480
 because it contained Bordeaux and it made Claret.

561
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,920
 And England imported so much Claret.

562
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,040
 So by the 14th century, I think Bordeaux

563
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:33,520
 was sending Britain enough wine for every single person

564
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,080
 in Britain, including children,

565
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,280
 to have six bottles each a year.

566
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,280
 And suddenly Philip the Sixth said,

567
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,920
 "You can't have that region anymore."

568
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,480
 And the English said, "Well, what are we gonna do

569
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,600
 "about our wine?"

570
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,800
 And that's what caused it.

571
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,680
 And I think that's the most justified cause for war.

572
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,680
 - 'Cause the Gascons, they were like,

573
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,280
 "Oh, well, we're kind of happy being like friends

574
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,480
 "with the English because they're quite a long way away

575
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,440
 "and you have to get past the Bay of Biscay

576
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,280
 "and over the channel and they're not gonna come

577
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,880
 "and bother us and we don't really want to be friends

578
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,880
 "with these French people who are right next door

579
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,400
 "who might start taxing us more

580
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,920
 "or might start invading us and whatever."

581
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,960
 - I didn't realize, and I'm saying this more

582
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,840
 as someone who doesn't have a good grasp of English history

583
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,520
 and 100 years of war and stuff like that,

584
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,760
 but I didn't realize that in this period,

585
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,320
 French was basically the language of the upper class

586
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,680
 in the UK and English was the working class language.

587
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:30,200
 And so that's why there was, as you say Anna,

588
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,560
 it was sort of a bit confusing.

589
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,520
 And there was also the inheritance of the crown in France.

590
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:38,280
 Anyway, it wasn't there with Philip becoming king,

591
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,080
 but he wasn't a direct descendant of the king

592
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,680
 and Charles thought he had a closer connection

593
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,080
 and should be the rightful heir.

594
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,680
 So there was that as well as the wine.

595
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,400
 - Edward thought he had a rightful connection.

596
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,240
 - Sorry, that's what I meant.

597
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,080
 - Yeah, yeah.

598
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,080
 - I think that's true, actually.

599
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,000
 As in, if you just go straight off

600
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,320
 that whoever's related the most closely,

601
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,840
 Edward was definitely the most closely related.

602
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,880
 But the French barons, they wanted Philip

603
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,280
 because he was one of them, really.

604
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,200
 That was a thing.

605
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,160
 But Edward's lineage came through his mother

606
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,240
 who was Isabella the she-wolf of France.

607
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,580
 - She's incredible.

608
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,440
 - Why would you not want someone who's called

609
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,000
 Isabella the she-wolf to be the mother of the king?

610
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,840
 Well, you know.

611
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,760
 - Well, Isabella was the one who,

612
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,640
 she was Edward's mother,

613
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,760
 but she had overthrown his father, her husband,

614
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,280
 Edward II, possibly thanks to shoving

615
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,520
 a red hot poker up his arse.

616
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,840
 - That probably not really.

617
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,400
 - Probably not, but definitely due to her

618
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,320
 picking up a lover, Roger Mortimer,

619
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,700
 and deciding to take over England.

620
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,320
 - Was the red hot poker up the arse

621
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:45,360
 a, that was an aggressive thing, an enjoyable thing?

622
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,480
 - It might have been enjoyable

623
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,840
 at the very beginning of the situation,

624
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,620
 but certainly by the end, he wasn't enjoying it.

625
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,460
 - Right, okay.

626
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,640
 - It's like, isn't that a bit of,

627
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,040
 it's sort of a bit of later homophobic propaganda,

628
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,360
 isn't it, that thing of 'cause--

629
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,360
 - I just think so.

630
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,760
 - 'Cause Edward II took a male lover who was,

631
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,600
 I can't remember his name now,

632
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,080
 but he was-- - Hey.

633
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,440
 - I've just finished David Mitchell's book,

634
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,720
 which goes into great detail about the, you know--

635
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,160
 - Dispenser, Hugh Dispenser, is he called?

636
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,160
 - Hugh Dispenser.

637
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,000
 - I think so.

638
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,080
 - That's a funny name.

639
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,160
 (laughing)

640
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,660
 Oh no, Piers Gavaston.

641
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,000
 - Piers Gavaston?

642
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,440
 He had terrible reflux, didn't he?

643
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,520
 - They were both, oh God,

644
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,480
 I think they were both rumoured,

645
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,800
 certainly rumoured to be,

646
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,720
 basically the problem was that

647
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,400
 Edward II was a big at choosing favourites

648
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,080
 and was very bad at distributing favours

649
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,800
 in a kind of equitable manner,

650
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,920
 so lots of people got very aggrieved about that,

651
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,480
 and clearly then Isabella enters the scene.

652
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,040
 - And the other thing about putting a red hot poker

653
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:39,880
 of the bum is that it doesn't leave any obvious scars

654
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,440
 unless you take a good old look at the bum.

655
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,280
 So you can kill someone, theoretically,

656
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,040
 and they might think that they died of something,

657
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,000
 an illness.

658
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,240
 - Nah, until you look at the look on their face,

659
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,600
 in death.

660
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,440
 (laughing)

661
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,600
 - I'm surprised that you're a poker truther on this, James.

662
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,440
 - What?

663
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,360
 - I think it's not, I think it didn't happen.

664
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,760
 I think, I mean, Khaliba's bumped off.

665
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,960
 - Oh, sorry, I'm not saying it happened,

666
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,600
 I'm just saying that that is part of the propaganda

667
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,680
 is that they say this is why.

668
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,320
 - There seems to be a through line of arses

669
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,680
 in the Hundred Years War,

670
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,040
 because there was that,

671
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,920
 which fair enough is in the lead up to it,

672
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,760
 there was obviously the original fact,

673
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,760
 and then there was the fact that in 1346,

674
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,600
 so very early on,

675
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,360
 on the way to the Battle of Klesi,

676
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,160
 which was one of the sort of biggest,

677
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,000
 most important battles of the Hundred Years War,

678
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,240
 the Norman soldiers exposed their backsides

679
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,560
 to Edward III's archers,

680
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,240
 and according to reports,

681
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,280
 this pissed off the English so much

682
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,880
 that they basically launched an ill-advised attack.

683
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,400
 - They decided to win the battle instead of...

684
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,280
 (laughing)

685
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,760
 - No, they launched an ill-advised attack,

686
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,720
 which they lost,

687
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,880
 because they were so offended by the bear arses.

688
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,720
 - That's interesting.

689
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,120
 - Sorry, Anna, can I just quickly check?

690
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,840
 When you say there's a lot of arses,

691
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,960
 and you say the original fact,

692
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,960
 are you including your new theory

693
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,520
 that they were shoving their penises up their anus?

694
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,520
 - No, this is too much, no.

695
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,000
 - She said the original fact.

696
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,760
 - I know, it's nothing to do with the original fact.

697
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,600
 This is Anna's first little...

698
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,440
 - It's not, sorry, sorry.

699
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,880
 It's my reading of the original fact

700
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,080
 where they exposed themselves

701
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,440
 in a flashing kind of way, yes.

702
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,040
 - One person in the Battle of Klesi

703
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,400
 was blind King John of Bohemia.

704
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,800
 He was there to support...

705
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,520
 - So he wouldn't have been affected by the mooning,

706
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,800
 to be fair, he was the one person who was immune to it.

707
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,720
 - He was actually on the side of the mooners.

708
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,200
 He was on Philip's side,

709
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,680
 but he'd had a bout of ophthalmia,

710
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,480
 which meant that at the time he couldn't really see anything.

711
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,640
 So he asked two of his knights to be on either side of him,

712
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,080
 while he was sort of strapped to his horse,

713
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,600
 and the two knights went towards the battle

714
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,120
 while he was in between them,

715
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,880
 so that he knew exactly that he was going

716
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,040
 in the right direction.

717
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,720
 - Good Lord, that is very brave.

718
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,720
 King John, you are allowed to sit this one out, it's fine.

719
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,480
 No one will think any less of you

720
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,960
 if you don't fight today.

721
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,920
 - No, no, I'm here now.

722
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,000
 - No, Grace, no.

723
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,840
 - Well, obviously the English won it.

724
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,560
 - Oh, did the English win the Battle of Cressy?

725
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,400
 - Yeah, they did.

726
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:59,040
 - James, of course the English won the battle, I'm sorry.

727
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,760
 - Auntie, your outrage there is embarrassing.

728
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,000
 You're Scottish anyway, Auntie,

729
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,320
 you should be on the French side.

730
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,560
 - England only won about three battles

731
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,400
 in the Hundred Years' War,

732
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,240
 and they were definitely tilted towards the start.

733
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,280
 It was as in court, Cressy, sluice, sluice.

734
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,120
 - Yeah.

735
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,320
 - Where the French fleet was sunk.

736
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,360
 No, if Britain had just,

737
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,720
 England had just kind of sued for peace

738
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,840
 after the first 30 years,

739
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,680
 they'd had a completely cracking first 30 years to the war,

740
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,520
 and then after the,

741
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,880
 it was kind of gradually all downhill

742
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,960
 for the next sort of 70, 80 years.

743
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,520
 It didn't go well for them after that.

744
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,360
 It is classic.

745
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,120
 - Oh yeah, but Agincourt was a pretty good ending.

746
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,600
 - That was right towards the end.

747
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,200
 It was like a late goal.

748
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,400
 - And I think the French would object to you

749
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,960
 calling Agincourt an ending,

750
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,920
 given that when it did end, it was very much.

751
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,960
 - It was 30 years after the Battle of Agincourt,

752
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,000
 and the French won the whole war over.

753
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,600
 - The Battle of Sluice was interesting

754
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,920
 because this was a naval battle,

755
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,840
 and the English fleet came up,

756
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,960
 and there was,

757
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,120
 they were kind of maneuvering to get to the best angle

758
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,680
 because of the wind and stuff like that.

759
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,920
 And when they were maneuvering,

760
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,600
 the French got entangled with each other,

761
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,000
 all the different boats,

762
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,280
 'cause they were ready,

763
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,160
 but then because it didn't start straight away,

764
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,280
 they kind of all sort of bumped into each other

765
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,800
 and all got really entangled.

766
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,240
 - The French actually chained their boats together.

767
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:17,120
 Sometimes there seemed to be a tactic that worked,

768
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,080
 but it certainly wasn't in this instance,

769
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,600
 because, as you say, it meant they got entangled,

770
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,240
 so basically a ship couldn't go to the aid of another ship

771
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,880
 'cause they were literally attached together.

772
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,240
 It was like doing a three-legged race,

773
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,200
 but with 100 people all attached to each other in the race.

774
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,560
 - It's a bit like playing foosball.

775
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,840
 It's like, it's fine.

776
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,320
 As long as the ball is right next to one of your players,

777
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,520
 you can spin around and kick it,

778
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,960
 but as soon as the ball goes anywhere,

779
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,520
 not near your players, you're fucked.

780
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,480
 - And that's why football teams

781
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,560
 tend to not chain themselves together, isn't that right?

782
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,720
 I don't watch a lot, but that is, yeah, yeah, yeah.

783
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,240
 I like this theory, okay, there's a theory

784
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,640
 that actually the Hundred Years War

785
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,760
 really lasted from 1066 until 1904.

786
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,600
 Just a millennium of Anglo-French conflict

787
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,560
 happened basically, kicking off, obviously,

788
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,400
 with the Battle of Hastings,

789
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,280
 and then the 1904 was when the Entente-Cordial agreements

790
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,280
 were signed between England and France,

791
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,520
 which really bonded them very closely together.

792
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,320
 - Yeah. - There was so much conflict, you know.

793
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:11,320
 - Do you think, Andy, like, obviously we are allies now,

794
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,360
 but there were peace treaties signed

795
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,160
 all over those thousand years,

796
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,840
 and there's no reason to think that in 500 years

797
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,880
 there won't be another battle between England and France.

798
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,040
 So in that case, with the Hundred Years War,

799
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:23,880
 go on for the rest of the day.

800
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,080
 - You think this might be a long lull?

801
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,640
 - That's what I was thinking, yeah.

802
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,480
 - I hope, oh gosh, I do hope not, 'cause I love France.

803
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,320
 - Yeah, me too.

804
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,400
 - But look, it's possible.

805
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,240
 - I actually like it a little bit too much,

806
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,200
 and I'm thinking that, you know,

807
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,040
 that area around Bordeaux is very nice.

808
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,120
 - Do you think maybe, James,

809
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,000
 you might actually have a claim to Gascony?

810
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,040
 - I do drink a lot of wine.

811
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,800
 - You might, you know.

812
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,760
 - Just give it a try.

813
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,880
 A little foray, never hurt anyone.

814
00:27:51,880 --> 00:28:00,120
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

815
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,320
 and that is my fact.

816
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,840
 My fact this week is that Buzz Aldrin's dad

817
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,320
 once got so angry that his son wasn't featured

818
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,360
 on a US post stamp commemorating the moon landing

819
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,240
 that he went and stood outside the White House

820
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:15,200
 holding a placard that read, "My son was first too."

821
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,440
 So it's the ultimate embarrassing dad move.

822
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,760
 - It is demented.

823
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,040
 This is such a weird thing to do.

824
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,000
 - Why?

825
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,240
 I just think, take the win.

826
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,800
 That your son has been the second man

827
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,400
 to walk on the moon, just, he's not on the stamp.

828
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,240
 - Who cares?

829
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,920
 - It's odd, but I actually think so.

830
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,840
 Buzz Aldrin's dad, Edwin Aldrin Sr.,

831
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,360
 the buzzer's real name is Edwin, he's a junior.

832
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,920
 I have a bit of sympathy for him

833
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,800
 because I think basically he is

834
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,920
 one of the most extraordinary characters

835
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:49,360
 that we've had in relation to airplanes and rockets

836
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,200
 and so on.

837
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,600
 This is a guy who was literally buddies with Orville Wright,

838
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,800
 knew the Wright brother.

839
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,800
 He marries a woman who is with us.

840
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,640
 - The Wright brother.

841
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,320
 You can't say the Wright brother.

842
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,240
 It's either the Wright brothers or A Wright brother.

843
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,520
 - He is A Wright brother.

844
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,080
 - The other one's the wrong brother.

845
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:11,560
 - So he's buddies with Orville Wright of the Wright brothers.

846
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,680
 He happens to be flying with a guy

847
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,840
 who's surname is Moon.

848
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,880
 He marries a woman who is called Marion Moon.

849
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,680
 His son then goes on to stand on the moon,

850
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,400
 but really he's also kind of the reason

851
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,360
 that we got to the moon.

852
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,280
 It's because he was very good friends

853
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:29,520
 with a rocket engineer called Goddard, right?

854
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,920
 Goddard is the one who basically got us to the moon.

855
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,400
 He's the one who was so key to inventing

856
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,440
 the rocket power that we needed to get there

857
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,920
 and he didn't have funding.

858
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,160
 And that was a huge problem.

859
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,720
 So Edwin Aldrin Sr., he knows him

860
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,200
 because he studied under Goddard

861
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,760
 and he's also an influential guy in that world.

862
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,280
 He sets up a meeting with Lindbergh,

863
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,680
 first to fly the Atlantic,

864
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,240
 in which he basically says,

865
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,080
 are you able to get Goddard the funding

866
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,000
 that he needs in order to go on?

867
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,080
 He goes to the Guggenheim Foundation

868
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,320
 and manages to get the money.

869
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,560
 So Edwin Aldrin Sr. literally made the funding happen

870
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,920
 in order for us to get to the moon.

871
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,200
 So I can see why he's pissed off

872
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,120
 'cause he's literally the linchpin to all these elements.

873
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,120
 - I know what you mean, Dan,

874
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,440
 but you've introduced him in this section

875
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,360
 as the guy who stood with a placard

876
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,920
 as an embarrassing dad.

877
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,760
 - It's definitely an embarrassing dad move,

878
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,200
 no matter what, but I can see his reasoning.

879
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,680
 - No, come up with something better,

880
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,480
 like my son was there too,

881
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,240
 or my son also went to the moon.

882
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,480
 He said my son was first too.

883
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,920
 It's the only thing that's not true.

884
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:34,760
 - Can I just say, this is in 1969, right?

885
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,120
 The stamp is issued.

886
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,000
 Aldrin himself clearly was a bit

887
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,680
 narked about it because he had to go

888
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,880
 to the unveiling of the stamp.

889
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,160
 Aldrin wrote in his memoir,

890
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,000
 "I smiled rather weakly when I first saw the stamp,

891
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,920
 "though it was a bittersweet honor."

892
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,800
 I mean, come on.

893
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,320
 Michael Collins' thoughts about this are not registered.

894
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,720
 Michael Collins is nowhere even near this stamp.

895
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,440
 Didn't kick up half the fuss.

896
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,840
 Also, it's not Neil Armstrong on the stamp, right?

897
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:05,680
 You are not allowed to commemorate the living on stamps.

898
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:09,960
 So logically, it can't be Neil Armstrong on this stamp.

899
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,320
 - So is it not like a famous image of him?

900
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,640
 - I think it's a drawing of a photo.

901
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,480
 - It's a drawing of the photo.

902
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,320
 - A drawing.

903
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,080
 - At some point between the photo and the drawing,

904
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,440
 Neil Armstrong has been replaced by a generic man.

905
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,000
 And this got controversial when they released

906
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,120
 an anniversary stamp some years later,

907
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,440
 'cause many thought that it portrayed Armstrong and Aldrin,

908
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,720
 who were alive at the time,

909
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,520
 and that has two astronauts on it facing the camera.

910
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,280
 But they've got the helmets up with the visor

911
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,400
 so you can't see.

912
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,040
 - And the US Postal Service never admitted to breaking the law

913
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,880
 forbidding the portrayal of living people.

914
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,600
 They just said these are generic astronauts

915
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,240
 to commemorate these two people who were real,

916
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,160
 who landed on the moon.

917
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,800
 It's such a fudge.

918
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,760
 - It's definitely a fudge

919
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,320
 when you've literally drawn a picture of a specific person.

920
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:55,240
 Yeah, I would say that Edwin's at least justified in that.

921
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,160
 - I read an article that was in the newspaper archives

922
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,480
 that came out the weekend after they landed on the moon,

923
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,720
 where they spoke to all the families and stuff like that.

924
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,720
 And we've said before that Buzz had communion on the moon.

925
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,160
 But I didn't know this.

926
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:13,320
 At the same time as he was taking communion on the moon,

927
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,880
 in his church back home,

928
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,560
 they were taking the same communion

929
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,760
 with the same bit of bread.

930
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,600
 - No.

931
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,000
 - So the priest had gotten this big bit of bread

932
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,320
 and broken a bit off and given one piece of it to Buzz.

933
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:28,120
 And at the exact same time-ish,

934
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,680
 they did their own communion.

935
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,040
 And the priest said, "This loaf is not complete.

936
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,680
 "Now we shall commune with him.

937
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,040
 "He is one of us."

938
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,640
 And they're referring to Buzz.

939
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,600
 And they had to get extra seats in the church

940
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,520
 because so many people wanted to come to this communion.

941
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,600
 And they all had Bibles donated by Buzz

942
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,160
 that were inscribed with his mother's name

943
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,840
 'cause actually Buzz's mother died

944
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,160
 before he got to the moon.

945
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,720
 - It was the year before, wasn't it?

946
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,600
 - Yeah, it was May 1968.

947
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,440
 And she took her own life.

948
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,360
 And according to Buzz, the reason that she did that

949
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,520
 is because she couldn't handle the stress of the fame

950
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,240
 and notoriety that he was gaining

951
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,600
 from being an astronaut that was going to the moon.

952
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,360
 He says it was mixed with other stuff,

953
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,600
 but that was a big factor.

954
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,320
 What a weird thing to take with you

955
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,960
 as you're about to go off to the moon,

956
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,080
 that you lost your mom for the reason of the mission.

957
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,560
 - Yeah, Marian Gladys Moon was her name.

958
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,080
 And it was 'cause he'd done the Gemini mission.

959
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,320
 So he was actually super famous

960
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,040
 before he went to the moon off the back of that.

961
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,640
 And sweetly, Buzz Aldrin did,

962
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,480
 I realized kind of looking into him,

963
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,840
 he's always mentioning the fact

964
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,840
 that his mother's maiden name was Moon.

965
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,720
 I suppose you would, because it's an incredible fact,

966
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,520
 but he does in any autobiography or interview,

967
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:40,520
 or anything like that, he will say, or he'll tweet it

968
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,000
 and say, yep, mother's maiden name was Moon.

969
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,840
 Who would have thought?

970
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,640
 - Yeah, and he was in this newspaper article that I read,

971
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,120
 he was called the World Spacewalking Champion, they said.

972
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,360
 And the other person on the moon is Buzz Aldrin,

973
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,080
 the World Spacewalking Champion.

974
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,320
 (laughing)

975
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,320
 - Not the first though, was he?

976
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,280
 - He wasn't the first on the moon.

977
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:01,000
 - He'd spent five hours outside Gemini 12,

978
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,120
 which meant that he'd been out in space on his own

979
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,720
 for longer than any other person.

980
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,480
 I think Leonov was the first, wasn't he?

981
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,520
 - Just back to the moon and families for a second,

982
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,200
 there was a lot of stuff that was left on the moon,

983
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:15,640
 which was related to the family members of the astronauts.

984
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:19,360
 Some initials were sort of put into the moon dust

985
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,200
 that will be sitting there for many, many, many, many years

986
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,200
 unless they're disturbed by future missions

987
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,120
 or meteorite hits or whatever.

988
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,480
 There was a photo that was left of one of the families.

989
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,280
 So all these little beautiful little mementos.

990
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,320
 And there's actually, and I hadn't heard of this before,

991
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,280
 but there is a mystery about Neil Armstrong and the moon.

992
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,800
 And that is a missing 10 minutes

993
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,440
 where Neil went off-coms and stood by a crater

994
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,600
 just for 10 minutes on his own.

995
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,160
 And there's a lot of, there's a lot of conjecture

996
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,800
 about what he did in that 10 minutes.

997
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,640
 - I reckon he put his penis into his bubble.

998
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,480
 (laughing)

999
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,920
 Stop, I've walked around and said,

1000
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,880
 "I'm the first woman on the moon."

1001
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,120
 (laughing)

1002
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:02,800
 - I think he just felt the hot jacket potato

1003
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,640
 he brought with him in his space suit

1004
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,040
 and warmed his hands up on that cold landscape.

1005
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,920
 - I think he stared into outer space

1006
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,640
 and surveyed the enormity of what he was achieving

1007
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,680
 and representing, okay?

1008
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,400
 And stuck his penis in his bum crack.

1009
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,360
 (laughing)

1010
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,200
 - Oh my God.

1011
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,080
 - Yeah, no, so there's a,

1012
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,400
 it's to do with family is one of the biggest theories,

1013
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,640
 which is the fact that he very tragically lost a daughter

1014
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,640
 who was two years old at the time.

1015
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,800
 And there was a bracelet that he had with her name on it.

1016
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,280
 And the thought is, is that he left that on the moon.

1017
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,040
 He chucked that into the crater.

1018
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,360
 And James Hansen, who is the official biographer

1019
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:45,400
 of Neil Armstrong, desperately tried to prove this.

1020
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,880
 And he could never get it out of Neil,

1021
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,160
 whether or not it happened.

1022
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,160
 His family sort of said, "I hope it happened,"

1023
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,840
 but they weren't quite sure themselves.

1024
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:56,160
 And so it's remained an unanswered question.

1025
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,720
 - When the moon landing happened,

1026
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:02,080
 there was a protest in America at the same time,

1027
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,320
 not by Buzz Aldrin's father,

1028
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,720
 but by 25 families, African-American families

1029
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,520
 who walked to Kennedy Space Center

1030
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,920
 because they said it was a distorted sense

1031
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,840
 of national priorities that America was going to the moon.

1032
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,080
 Because at the time,

1033
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:22,560
 the poverty rate for African-Americans was 31%.

1034
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:27,160
 And for black people living on farms, it was 62%.

1035
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,080
 And so they said, "Well, why are you spending all this money

1036
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,880
 on the space race when you have people living in poverty

1037
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,440
 in your own country?"

1038
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,280
 And the Victoria Maris,

1039
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,000
 who was the head of the poverty program in Michigan,

1040
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,720
 she said that the Apollo project was akin to a man

1041
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,160
 who has a large family.

1042
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,520
 They have no shoes, no clothing, no food,

1043
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,760
 and the rent is overdue, but when he gets paid,

1044
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,720
 he runs out and buys himself another set of electric trains.

1045
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:58,720
 - Oh, slam on people who just enjoy some nice train.

1046
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,240
 (laughing)

1047
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:05,000
 I got to say, I sympathize with that guy getting his trains.

1048
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,360
 - But you've got to stop keeping your wife

1049
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,840
 in poverty, Andy, there's no reason.

1050
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,680
 (laughing)

1051
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,240
 - And the New York Amsterdam News,

1052
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,680
 which was one of the leading black newspapers at the time,

1053
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,440
 had the headline, "Yesterday, the moon, tomorrow, maybe us."

1054
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,240
 So it wasn't, and actually the space program--

1055
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,680
 - Oh, what, they'll be spending money on us?

1056
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,120
 - Yeah, precisely.

1057
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,960
 And actually until 1969,

1058
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,680
 pretty much the space program wasn't universally liked.

1059
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,920
 In fact, possibly not even 50% liked in America,

1060
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,040
 'cause a lot of people were like,

1061
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,560
 "Well, why are we wasting money on this

1062
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,160
 when there's problems at home?"

1063
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,960
 And it was really only when everyone,

1064
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,160
 when they walked on the moon,

1065
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,360
 that the kind of opinion changed in America.

1066
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,960
 - Yeah, there's a really nice description.

1067
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,320
 One of the best books ever,

1068
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,800
 I think about the Apollo missions is a book called "Moon Dust",

1069
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,640
 if anyone is interested in this subject,

1070
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,920
 listening by Andrew Smith,

1071
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,600
 and he talks about all these protests,

1072
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,560
 and sort of the reaction,

1073
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,200
 literally as the rocket was going into space,

1074
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,280
 the mood changed,

1075
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,160
 everyone suddenly was on board in support of it,

1076
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:06,200
 not everyone, but large groups that were protesting,

1077
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,640
 suddenly just couldn't help,

1078
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:10,840
 but see the majesty of what we were doing as humanity.

1079
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,000
 So yeah, it's pretty amazing.

1080
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,040
 - So we know on the side of your falling on Dan,

1081
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,920
 you think send money to the moon missions

1082
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,280
 rather than people in poverty, okay.

1083
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,600
 - I think send poor people to the moon.

1084
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:25,600
 That's how we just put them off Earth and we'll be fine.

1085
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,000
 - Interesting, oh, I see.

1086
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,480
 I was gonna say, interestingly,

1087
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:33,440
 that was kind of how the Soviets chose their cosmonauts

1088
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,200
 is that they tried to find people

1089
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,600
 who were born into poor backgrounds.

1090
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,520
 'Cause obviously it was very,

1091
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,360
 yeah, it was very good with their narrative,

1092
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,640
 which was, you know, we're all together,

1093
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,520
 and if you grew up on a communal farm,

1094
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:48,080
 then you're just as good as anyone else in the country.

1095
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,000
 - I thought you were gonna say, obviously it was very easy,

1096
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,560
 which it would have been in the Soviet Union

1097
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,920
 at that time to find people with poor backgrounds, but.

1098
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,560
 - Certainly was, true.

1099
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,840
 Gagarin was born,

1100
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,560
 Yuri Gagarin, who was the first man in space,

1101
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,400
 was born in a town called Gagarin.

1102
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,800
 - Oh.

1103
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,080
 - But it was named after him after his death.

1104
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,640
 (both laughing)

1105
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,800
 But yeah, he was brought up on a collective farm,

1106
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,240
 and his mother had been a factory worker in World War II,

1107
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,520
 and this was like a perfect sort of background

1108
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,400
 for a cosmonaut.

1109
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,360
 Toreshkova, Valentina Toreshkova,

1110
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:23,080
 who was the first woman in space,

1111
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:26,320
 she was born in a town which has a population of nine.

1112
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,160
 - Wow. - Wow.

1113
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,360
 - Do we call it a town? - Wow.

1114
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,680
 - Yeah, it's officially a town.

1115
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,920
 - Wow. - But she was working

1116
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,560
 in a textile mill. - Really?

1117
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,800
 - And eventually did some correspondence courses,

1118
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,880
 and then became a cosmonaut.

1119
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,200
 So they really wanted to get people

1120
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,160
 from other backgrounds into space.

1121
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,400
 - I'm really interested that you said that,

1122
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,400
 'cause it certainly is interesting.

1123
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,440
 Researching cosmonauts and astronauts

1124
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:50,200
 is striking how all the astronauts from America

1125
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,880
 at the time had quite similar upbringings,

1126
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,040
 very successful parents,

1127
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,640
 often in the aeronautical industry.

1128
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:59,360
 All Soviet cosmonauts were quite gritty upbringings.

1129
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,920
 I mean, Gagarin and his family

1130
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:04,560
 lived in a three meter square mud hut during the war

1131
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,360
 because their property was taken over by Nazis.

1132
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:10,360
 On the one hand, Gagarin rebelled against the Nazis

1133
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,440
 who were occupying his land,

1134
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,360
 and he used to pour soil in the Nazi soldiers' tank batteries

1135
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:19,400
 and kind of mix up their chemicals to foil their plans.

1136
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:23,280
 And then I was reading that later on,

1137
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,800
 when he was famous, a famous cosmonaut,

1138
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,920
 he got a scar on his forehead,

1139
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,920
 which you can see in later pictures.

1140
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,760
 And it's from 1961 when he was on holiday

1141
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,000
 with his wife and a bunch of other people,

1142
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,680
 and they were playing cards.

1143
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,760
 And he said, I'm going to bed,

1144
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,000
 his wife said, I'm just going to finish this hand.

1145
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,680
 You know, I'll be there in a sec.

1146
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,760
 He used this spare time to go into the hotel room

1147
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,960
 of one of the other women who was a nurse

1148
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,760
 who was staying in the hotel, tried to check her,

1149
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,680
 and then his wife walked down the corridor

1150
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,600
 having finished her hand a couple of minutes later,

1151
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,520
 saying, where are you, Yuri?

1152
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,600
 And so he legged it off the balcony

1153
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,200
 of this nurse's room to escape,

1154
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,160
 split his head open on the tarmac.

1155
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:09,120
 And that's the glorious story of the first Russian

1156
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,000
 in space's scar.

1157
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,120
 - Amazing. - How do I get this?

1158
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,600
 Fighting Nazis, actually.

1159
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,480
 (laughing)

1160
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,920
 Would you like to talk to an alien,

1161
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,920
 assuming that the alien can speak your language

1162
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,920
 and your safety is guaranteed?

1163
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,760
 - Yes. - Would you like to

1164
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,600
 meet an alien? - Yeah, I would.

1165
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,000
 - Okay, don't do that, yeah.

1166
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,320
 - Is this an offer, Andy?

1167
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,560
 - It's not an offer, it's a survey from YouGov.

1168
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,800
 This was done last year.

1169
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,640
 21% of people said, no, I would not, thank you very much.

1170
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,840
 Even if we can speak the same language and I'm safe.

1171
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:41,400
 14% don't know, I don't know.

1172
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,960
 - I more can't understand the nose.

1173
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,880
 That is absolutely, are they too busy?

1174
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,440
 Did we get the reasons?

1175
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,800
 - Maybe if you're religious,

1176
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,600
 you don't want the answers that are gonna ruin things for you.

1177
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,440
 Maybe.

1178
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,560
 - Well, there was that, I won't say who it was, Dan,

1179
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,480
 but a very famous person who we offered

1180
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,300
 to come on the Museum of Curiosity when--

1181
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,140
 - When Buzz was on.

1182
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:05,200
 - When Buzz Aldrin came on and Dan emailed them

1183
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,400
 and said, would you like, come on,

1184
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,120
 you can meet the second person who walks on the moon

1185
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,320
 and that person wrote back saying,

1186
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,680
 no, I don't really like space.

1187
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,480
 - Yeah, not really into space.

1188
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:16,680
 - Can you bleep out and say who it was now?

1189
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:17,840
 (beep)

1190
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,680
 - Get out.

1191
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,520
 - Yeah.

1192
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,400
 - You're going back going, I'm such a nice space,

1193
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:25,180
 not really my thing, but thanks for the offer.

1194
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:27,880
 - I'm staggered, I'm staggered.

1195
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,080
 - Yeah, it was incredible.

1196
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,280
 - That's shocking.

1197
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:34,640
 - So that person, I reckon probably would be one of the 20%.

1198
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,860
 - Yeah.

1199
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:36,700
 - I agree.

1200
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:39,000
 - Dairy-like aliens, not my thing, I'm interested.

1201
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,360
 - Yeah, no, thank you.

1202
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,940
 (upbeat music)

1203
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:48,360
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show

1204
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,440
 and that is James.

1205
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:53,680
 - Okay, my fact this week is if you go to the Arctic

1206
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:57,600
 at the right time, you can view huge herds of moss balls

1207
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,160
 migrating across the plains.

1208
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,280
 - Magnificent.

1209
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,480
 - Now, if you do go there to see the migrating moss balls,

1210
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:09,460
 we should say migrating at a speed that you would expect.

1211
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:12,300
 It's probably a bit of a misleading idea.

1212
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:15,140
 These are, if your trip is for seven years,

1213
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:18,980
 you might see it move a good foot or baby.

1214
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:21,020
 - If you're really eagle-eyed,

1215
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:22,980
 they move about an inch a day.

1216
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:23,820
 - Yeah.

1217
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:27,020
 - It's not the quickest migration ever, but you know,

1218
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:28,580
 it's not bad for a moss.

1219
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:30,060
 - It is astonishing as well.

1220
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:32,500
 It is astonishing when you see photos of these things

1221
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,260
 and the fact that they herd together

1222
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:37,360
 and they turn left together and they move forward together.

1223
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,640
 It's insane.

1224
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,360
 - So this is research by a couple of researchers,

1225
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:44,900
 one of whom I was reading about called Tim Bartholomus

1226
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:49,260
 and he described them as bright green in a world of white.

1227
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,760
 In the 1950s, when they were first described,

1228
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,700
 there was a nice landed guy who called them Glacier mice.

1229
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:57,060
 So that gives you kind of an idea of what they look like,

1230
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:58,660
 but they're bright green.

1231
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:02,380
 And if you look at them, they seem like they're not moving,

1232
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:04,620
 but actually they're very, very slowly moving

1233
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:07,100
 and they all move in the same direction.

1234
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:08,980
 And they don't all move with the wind.

1235
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:12,700
 They don't all move because sunlight is melting bits of ice

1236
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:13,820
 and it's moving them.

1237
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:15,060
 They don't move.

1238
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:16,740
 There's various different theories.

1239
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:17,580
 - Angle of slopes.

1240
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:18,820
 - Yeah, they don't go downhill.

1241
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:20,260
 We don't know why they do it

1242
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:21,420
 and we don't know how they do it.

1243
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:23,020
 And every time we come up with a theory,

1244
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:24,460
 someone disproves it.

1245
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:25,280
 - Aliens?

1246
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,020
 Has anyone talked about the aliens?

1247
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:29,300
 - No, actually these are part of the 20%

1248
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,780
 that don't really like aliens.

1249
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:32,700
 (laughing)

1250
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,900
 - And the other brilliant thing is this scientist,

1251
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,580
 one of the ones, Tim Bartholomew,

1252
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:38,340
 I think he's Tim Bartholomew mouse

1253
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:39,940
 and these are Glacier mice.

1254
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:41,620
 - No, that's true.

1255
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:42,460
 - Yes.

1256
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:43,300
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1257
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:44,940
 - It is actually quite confusing when you read about them

1258
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:46,620
 'cause they're very commonly referred to

1259
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:49,020
 in the few things that have been written about them as mice.

1260
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,220
 And so you keep having to remind yourself halfway through

1261
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:53,620
 whatever the New York Times article when it says,

1262
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:55,940
 "And within the mice, it's extremely warm

1263
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:57,220
 "and lots of insects live.

1264
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:58,220
 "They're not actually mice.

1265
00:44:58,220 --> 00:44:59,060
 "They're not actually mice."

1266
00:44:59,060 --> 00:44:59,900
 - It was the plural of moss.

1267
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:00,740
 - The plural of moss is mice.

1268
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:01,560
 That's the other thing.

1269
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:02,400
 (laughing)

1270
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,240
 - Of course.

1271
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,080
 - Yeah.

1272
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:04,960
 The guy who discovered these in the '50s,

1273
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,980
 John Aetherson, he pointed out that

1274
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:11,740
 rolling stones can gather moss.

1275
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:12,740
 'Cause in the middle of all,

1276
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:13,940
 at the heart of all of these mice,

1277
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:15,500
 there might be a tiny bit of gravel

1278
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,500
 or a bit of something that it's formed around

1279
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:18,780
 and the moss has grown around.

1280
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:19,820
 And it's more like you get moss

1281
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:21,180
 that gathers and rolls over stones.

1282
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:23,060
 Actually, really.

1283
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:24,420
 But either way, it's gorgeous.

1284
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:26,620
 They're kind of like little mossy tumbleweed in a way.

1285
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:27,460
 - Yeah.

1286
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:30,780
 - I love the idea, the imagery of the pedestals

1287
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:31,620
 that they sit on.

1288
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:33,340
 If you catch them at the right time,

1289
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:34,980
 let's say you come across a herd,

1290
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:37,900
 they might all be perched up as if they're on plinths.

1291
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:41,140
 Because they're covering a very specific bit of the ice

1292
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:42,580
 with the mossy ball itself,

1293
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:44,980
 the ice will remain because they're insulating it

1294
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:46,300
 or rather keeping it cold.

1295
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:48,940
 So you end up seeing what looks genuinely,

1296
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:50,580
 I think, Anna, to your point,

1297
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:52,060
 like you'd be like, "Is this aliens?

1298
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:52,900
 "What is going on here?

1299
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:54,780
 "Has some weird artist come out here

1300
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:56,360
 "and just carved around these balls

1301
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,260
 "and left them for just to find?"

1302
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:02,260
 And one of the thoughts is that then it rolls down the hill

1303
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:04,300
 for what it's created off this pedestal

1304
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:05,980
 and they all roll at the same time.

1305
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:08,060
 - So that was one of the theories.

1306
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:10,740
 But again, this quite recent study

1307
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:13,380
 where they put trackers inside the mice

1308
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:16,140
 kind of disproved this theory of the pedestals.

1309
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,340
 Not that they exist 'cause they definitely do,

1310
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:19,900
 but there's something else happening

1311
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:22,940
 because it's not like they're staying in one place

1312
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:24,580
 and then moving.

1313
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:28,480
 They're kind of every day on average moving about an inch.

1314
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,440
 - And I love as well that this guy, Bartholomeus,

1315
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,160
 he's, the way they tracked it is they just put little bits

1316
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,440
 of like small wire around the moss balls

1317
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:39,280
 in different colors so they could see which one was which.

1318
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,400
 And he's been going back occasionally to see them,

1319
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,880
 but now he doesn't know where they are.

1320
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,880
 He's lost his moss balls.

1321
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:49,200
 And that's extraordinary that whole herd

1322
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,480
 has gone missing on him.

1323
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,240
 - If that moss ball can outrun you,

1324
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:55,980
 then you need to be taking more exercise, Bartholomeus.

1325
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:58,540
 - Can I read you a bit of romantic,

1326
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:01,100
 just a brief romantic passage about these things?

1327
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:02,780
 - Did you write it?

1328
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:05,260
 - No, thankfully, don't worry, I didn't.

1329
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:06,100
 - Okay, then yeah.

1330
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:07,340
 - This is about the other scientists

1331
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:09,140
 in this recent paper who studied these things.

1332
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:10,660
 Sophie Gilbert, she's a biologist.

1333
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:13,580
 And the University of Alaska website says,

1334
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:17,220
 they met in 2006 studying at the Wrangel Mountains Center.

1335
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:18,180
 Right?

1336
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:19,780
 And this is it.

1337
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:22,520
 In this expansive setting of a gorgeous ice plateau

1338
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,800
 between high mountains,

1339
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:27,520
 the pair noticed more than just tufts of moss.

1340
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,160
 She saw a handsome young leader

1341
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,880
 who wanted to solve glacier problems.

1342
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,000
 He saw an attractive, worldly biologist

1343
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,680
 who loved being outside, powered by flirty energy.

1344
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:39,040
 They started thinking about how to study these moss balls

1345
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,320
 and they're married now.

1346
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:41,160
 (laughing)

1347
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:44,720
 - Do you think it was the bowls that made them horny?

1348
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,920
 - I don't know what prompted the spark to the romance,

1349
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,540
 but I love the idea of proposing with a little moss ball

1350
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:54,420
 that you open up and the ring is in there.

1351
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:55,860
 That would be nice.

1352
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:57,420
 And there's also another guy called Hotterling

1353
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:58,780
 about whom little is related,

1354
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:01,620
 but he's the third scientist involved.

1355
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:04,140
 - There's a woman called Robin Wall Kimmerer

1356
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:06,100
 who I suspect some of you have come across

1357
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:08,300
 who seems to have written this brilliant book about moss.

1358
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:09,300
 I've only read reviews of it,

1359
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:12,100
 but she's sort of the moss pro.

1360
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:15,020
 And she looked a lot at moss traditions

1361
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:16,700
 in the Arctic in this area

1362
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:17,880
 and how people have used it.

1363
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,800
 And it's had so many purposes.

1364
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:24,000
 So people would make pillows out of moss.

1365
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,400
 There's a specific type of moss

1366
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:28,240
 that was very good for pillows called hypnum moss.

1367
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,600
 And the reason it's called that

1368
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:30,960
 is because it was used as a pillow

1369
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,520
 and it was thought if you slept on it,

1370
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:33,680
 it gives you special dreams.

1371
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,080
 So it's hypnum, like, you know,

1372
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,320
 hypnotizing dreams. - Wow, that's cool.

1373
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:40,720
 Do you think that if you got one of these moss balls,

1374
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,080
 then, you know, when your pillow gets too warm,

1375
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:44,640
 it can turn itself over?

1376
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,980
 - No. - Oh, lovely.

1377
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:48,140
 - So slowly, though,

1378
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:50,820
 you'd have to sit up for five minutes, probably.

1379
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:55,580
 They were used as nappies and sanitary towels,

1380
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:56,420
 which does make sense

1381
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:58,740
 'cause we've talked about hypnum moss before,

1382
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:01,500
 which can absorb 40 times its body weight in water.

1383
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:02,700
 It's pretty good.

1384
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:04,420
 And you could leave that nappy on for a week.

1385
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:05,700
 It's the dream. - Speak to someone

1386
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:06,540
 who's a mother.

1387
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:09,380
 You're fine, you're fine.

1388
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:12,060
 I can't smell anything, you're fine.

1389
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:15,320
 - I got a quiz question for you guys, very quickly.

1390
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,640
 Okay, here's the question.

1391
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,880
 What color is Oscar the Grouch?

1392
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:19,960
 - Green.

1393
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:20,960
 - Yeah, I'd say green.

1394
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,280
 - Brrr, yeah.

1395
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:24,600
 - That's the QI klaxon going there.

1396
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,560
 Oscar the Grouch is orange.

1397
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:27,480
 - Is he?

1398
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:28,760
 - So why is he green?

1399
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:30,440
 It's because he's moss. - Oh, it's living in his fur.

1400
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,180
 - It's because he's been living in a bin so long,

1401
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:36,280
 he's entirely covered in moss and mold.

1402
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:37,120
 - That's very good.

1403
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:38,560
 - His eye's so grouchy.

1404
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,120
 - Yeah.

1405
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:41,720
 So he's officially explained.

1406
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,780
 He said the first year I show myself in my true colors,

1407
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,900
 which is orange, actually I'm still orange.

1408
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:47,580
 If I ever took a bath, you'd see that.

1409
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:50,020
 This is mold and moss, it makes me happy.

1410
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:51,660
 - Oh, okay, yeah. - Wow, that's so funny.

1411
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:54,620
 - When's a good time for me to ask who Oscar the Grouch is?

1412
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:56,300
 - Wow, okay. - After the show.

1413
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,260
 - Yeah. - Okay, great, okay.

1414
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:01,220
 - Sesame Street, Sesame Street, he lives in the bin.

1415
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:02,380
 - I thought so, okay.

1416
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:05,300
 - Have you guys heard of Emmanuel the Grouchy?

1417
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:06,460
 - Ooh, nice.

1418
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:08,380
 - He was one of Napoleon's marshals

1419
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:09,460
 at the Battle of Waterloo.

1420
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:11,420
 I only remember this 'cause we talked about Waterloo

1421
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:13,320
 a few weeks ago. - Yes.

1422
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:17,080
 - And one of the main guys there was Emmanuel the Grouchy

1423
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,880
 and Napoleon made him like the Marshal of all France

1424
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,120
 or something like that.

1425
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,520
 - Well, there were six other marshals, weren't there?

1426
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,180
 There was Happy, Sleepy, Dopey.

1427
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:30,720
 Okay, giant moss, most moss is tiny, obviously, isn't it?

1428
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,360
 It's close to the ground, it's low, it's not,

1429
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,840
 you don't get moss trees.

1430
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:37,840
 The gigantic moss, the biggest moss on the planet

1431
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:41,820
 is called Dorsonia Superba and it gets up to 60 centimeters

1432
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:43,860
 tall and that is mega.

1433
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:44,980
 For a moss, that's insane.

1434
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:46,180
 - That's big. - That is big.

1435
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:49,100
 - And it's because mosses don't have internal fluid systems

1436
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:50,900
 to carry water to their tissues.

1437
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:52,340
 So they can dry out really easily,

1438
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,820
 so they have to stay close to the ground.

1439
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:55,500
 But Dorsonia has, it's so weird,

1440
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:57,060
 it's done convergent evolution.

1441
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:59,220
 So you know how trees have a xylem and a flow

1442
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:01,180
 and they have the system of porting water

1443
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:02,600
 all the way up to the leaves.

1444
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:05,420
 But Dorsonia has evolved a completely separate

1445
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:08,560
 conduction system that functions in the same way.

1446
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:11,040
 And so as a result, they can reach for the sky

1447
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,720
 and they grow much bigger as a result.

1448
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,640
 But that's very unusual.

1449
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,000
 - How big are we talking?

1450
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,240
 - I said 60 centimeters.

1451
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,080
 - 60 centimeters.

1452
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:19,760
 - It's not six zero.

1453
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,160
 - Imagine two school rulers.

1454
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,080
 - Yeah.

1455
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:23,920
 - Yeah.

1456
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:24,840
 - One on top of the other.

1457
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:25,680
 - Yeah.

1458
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:26,760
 - That's how tall we're talking here.

1459
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:27,600
 - Huge.

1460
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:30,560
 - Yeah, it's a similar reveal for the peanut

1461
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:32,040
 to the almond size, I would say.

1462
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:32,900
 (laughing)

1463
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:33,740
 - What?

1464
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:37,240
 - This must be like, it must be 1,000 times taller

1465
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,440
 than your average moss.

1466
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:39,280
 - No, it's incredible.

1467
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,120
 - Hundreds.

1468
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:42,380
 - And mosses, I don't think we've ever mentioned

1469
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:47,140
 that sort of the individual leaves are what are so tiny.

1470
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:49,080
 They're only one cell thick.

1471
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:51,640
 Isn't it so odd that we're looking at stuff

1472
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,640
 that we can see and it looks thick

1473
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:56,240
 and it covers rocks and tarmac and roofs and whatever.

1474
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,800
 Each leaf is one cell thick,

1475
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,800
 which means 100th of a millimeter, basically.

1476
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:03,920
 - It's small.

1477
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,240
 - It's small, yeah.

1478
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:08,780
 Some of them deliberately make themselves smell like poo

1479
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:10,120
 or corpses.

1480
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:12,660
 So this is--

1481
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:13,500
 - Why is that?

1482
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,980
 Because like plants do it so that insects come

1483
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:17,380
 and they get pollinated, right?

1484
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:19,500
 But that can't be 'cause they don't have pollen.

1485
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:20,900
 - No, no, same thing.

1486
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:23,980
 Same thing, so they get, so dispersing their seeds.

1487
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:25,660
 So most of them disperse via spores.

1488
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:26,660
 They get taken by the wind

1489
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:30,380
 and they can get taken amazing distances across continents.

1490
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:33,200
 But there are certain moss and one of the species

1491
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,680
 is called splachnums ferricum,

1492
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,520
 which is also known as pink stick dung moss.

1493
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,880
 And it lives on droppings.

1494
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,600
 And in fact, all of dung moss lives

1495
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,280
 on very specific types of dung.

1496
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:48,040
 So pink stick dung moss lives only on the droppings

1497
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,240
 of white-tailed deer about a month

1498
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,200
 after they've been pooed out.

1499
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:55,440
 And it grows on these droppings.

1500
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,000
 And then it uses these droppings

1501
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,240
 to make this amazing poo scent,

1502
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:02,300
 which it emits, which attracts all of these flies,

1503
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:03,340
 which come to lay their eggs.

1504
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:05,220
 And as they lay their eggs all over the moss,

1505
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:07,660
 they pick up these clusters of spores on their legs.

1506
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:09,660
 And so they disseminate them.

1507
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:11,420
 - That's amazing.

1508
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:12,740
 - I think I've got a different impression

1509
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:14,940
 of what moss is to maybe other people

1510
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:17,460
 because it's so mad that there's the idea

1511
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:20,060
 that moss has basically sperm in an egg

1512
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:23,060
 and that the sperm needs to find its way to an egg.

1513
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:25,460
 I thought moss just happened.

1514
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:27,100
 I didn't think the egg-- - Did you?

1515
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:28,420
 - Yeah, I did, absolutely.

1516
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:29,620
 - I thought, I didn't realize it was--

1517
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:31,680
 - Are you an ancient Greek naturalist?

1518
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:32,920
 (laughing)

1519
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:36,560
 - He's middle-aged's spontaneous generationalist.

1520
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:39,260
 - But I agree with Dan, the idea of sperm

1521
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:41,480
 and moss reproduction generally in moss sex

1522
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:42,840
 is so hard to get your head around.

1523
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,560
 And they sort of come in two phases of life.

1524
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:47,560
 But the way that the sperm find the egg

1525
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:51,540
 seems to be that certain male moss will produce sperm

1526
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:53,940
 in like a cup on top of them often

1527
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:56,280
 and then get splashed by raindrops,

1528
00:53:56,280 --> 00:54:00,100
 it also finds a way to swim to an egg of a female moss

1529
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:01,300
 and sex it up.

1530
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:03,700
 And that makes another moss that makes spores.

1531
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:06,340
 And understandably, I think they often don't do this

1532
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:08,020
 very often at all 'cause it's a lot of effort.

1533
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:11,140
 So I read an article featuring a biologist

1534
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:13,740
 called Kirstin Fisher who studies the sex lives

1535
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:16,580
 of a moss called Syntricia caninervous.

1536
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:19,180
 And she said they have sex about every 30 years.

1537
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:20,340
 So she's been in the field all the time.

1538
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:24,340
 - Well, you know, you're tired, you've been at work.

1539
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:26,360
 - It's so easy to just...

1540
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:29,440
 - Darling, it's been 29 years and 11 months.

1541
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,760
 (all laughing)

1542
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,200
 - That's so funny.

1543
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,240
 Oh my goodness.

1544
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,240
 What an amazing thing to study.

1545
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,700
 What a hero in a way.

1546
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:41,400
 Get on early, the sex life of a very particular moss

1547
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,280
 that only has sex every 30 years.

1548
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,000
 Here's one thing.

1549
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,120
 You've been in World War II.

1550
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,680
 It's been a pretty tough time.

1551
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,320
 You've been living in Europe.

1552
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:55,260
 Why would it be good to be a moss enthusiast?

1553
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:58,140
 - So there's lots of moss suddenly growing

1554
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:02,820
 in areas which have been abandoned due to the war?

1555
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:03,760
 - That's very good.

1556
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,000
 - Lots of dead people?

1557
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:05,840
 Lots of dead people.

1558
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:07,460
 There's a kind of moss that grows on corpses?

1559
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:08,300
 - Oh, there might be.

1560
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:09,700
 No, this is more practical.

1561
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:10,540
 - Okay.

1562
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:13,340
 - There's a very famous moss scientist in America

1563
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:16,580
 who named lots of mosses called Geneva Sare.

1564
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:18,620
 And at the end of the war,

1565
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:22,100
 she organized the sending of food, clothes, and money

1566
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:25,880
 to distressed bryologists in Europe.

1567
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:28,960
 So like if you were a moss scientist in Europe,

1568
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,280
 you could expect a nice little package of money

1569
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,320
 and clothes to come.

1570
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:33,160
 - I love that.

1571
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:34,640
 - I see moss people stick together.

1572
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:35,480
 That's great.

1573
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:37,020
 - Why are they particularly distressed?

1574
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:37,860
 Were they particularly distressed?

1575
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:40,140
 And bryologists are moss studyers, I think.

1576
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:41,540
 - Yeah.

1577
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:43,140
 Well, it's not that they're particularly distressed.

1578
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:44,400
 It's just that the industry is,

1579
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,260
 she's looking out for people who share her line of work.

1580
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:47,100
 - That's exactly it.

1581
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:49,480
 - Basically the entirety of Europe

1582
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:51,580
 was distressed after World War II.

1583
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:55,360
 And the bryologists were no exception.

1584
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:58,400
 And she thought, well, I'm gonna send some money over,

1585
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,700
 but I wanna send it to fellow moss, moss lovers.

1586
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:02,540
 - Someone gets in touch.

1587
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:04,820
 I studied lichen and I am, I really am quite distressed.

1588
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:05,660
 - No.

1589
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:06,500
 - Absolutely not.

1590
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:07,340
 No, get out.

1591
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:08,160
 (laughing)

1592
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,740
 (upbeat music)

1593
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:13,980
 - Okay, that's it.

1594
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:14,980
 That is all of our facts.

1595
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:16,380
 Thank you so much for listening.

1596
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:18,260
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

1597
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:19,380
 about the things that we've said

1598
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:20,660
 over the course of this podcast,

1599
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:23,460
 we can all be found on various bits of social media

1600
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:24,700
 out there, I'm on Instagram.

1601
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:26,380
 You can get me on @Sriberland.

1602
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:27,560
 James?

1603
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:28,940
 - I'm on TikTok.

1604
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:30,860
 I haven't ticked any talks.

1605
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:33,060
 And I mentioned it a few weeks ago

1606
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:36,860
 and I now have 44 followers, 45 followers.

1607
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:38,380
 So, you know, if you wanna boost,

1608
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:40,300
 you won't get anything in return.

1609
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:42,500
 But if you wanna come and see me on TikTok,

1610
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,820
 I'm at no such thing as James Harkin.

1611
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:48,100
 - Right, so that's where not to get in contact with James.

1612
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:49,420
 Andy?

1613
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:51,060
 - I'm on Twitter @AndreHunterM.

1614
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:52,580
 A lot of people also say they don't get anything

1615
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:54,900
 out of my stuff, but I do actually post quite frequently.

1616
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:57,060
 (laughing)

1617
00:56:57,060 --> 00:56:58,340
 - Or you can get through to all of us

1618
00:56:58,340 --> 00:56:59,340
 by going to our group account,

1619
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:00,860
 which is @NoSuchThing on Twitter,

1620
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:04,580
 or you can email us on podcast@QI.com.

1621
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:05,860
 Why not even check out our website?

1622
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:07,940
 You'll find all of our previous episodes up there.

1623
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:10,860
 You'll find a link to Clubfish, our secret zone,

1624
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:13,780
 where we have lots of extra bonus material and so on,

1625
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:15,380
 and a Discord, all really fun.

1626
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:16,220
 Check it out.

1627
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:17,620
 If not, just come back here next week.

1628
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:19,140
 We'll be back with another episode,

1629
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:20,180
 and we'll see you then.

1630
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:21,020
 Goodbye.

1631
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:23,600
 (upbeat music)

1632
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:26,180

1633
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:28,760

1636
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:36,500
