00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:16,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:16,00:00:17,"of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:17,00:00:19,a weekly podcast coming to you
00:00:19,00:00:23,from multiple undisclosed locations across the globe.
00:00:23,00:00:24,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:24,00:00:27,"I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray"
00:00:27,00:00:28,and James Harkin.
00:00:28,00:00:31,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:31,00:00:33,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:00:33,00:00:36,"and in a particular order, here we go."
00:00:36,00:00:39,"Starting with fact number one, that is Anna."
00:00:39,00:00:42,"- My fact this week is that in 1950,"
00:00:42,00:00:45,a ballet was performed at the Waldorf Hotel
00:00:45,00:00:49,"where the main characters were protons, electrons,"
00:00:49,00:00:52,neutrons and a Geiger counter.
00:00:52,00:00:54,- Lovely.
00:00:54,00:00:55,I have a question.
00:00:55,00:00:58,I reckon it's hard to see an electron
00:00:58,00:01:00,"even if you're on the front row,"
00:01:00,00:01:03,you're gonna struggle to see an electron doing a plie.
00:01:03,00:01:05,- Have you seen those ballet sort of little telecopies
00:01:05,00:01:06,you sometimes get at the ballet
00:01:06,00:01:08,where you put a coin in the slot and you can get a thing out?
00:01:08,00:01:10,"It's like that, but everyone gets a--"
00:01:10,00:01:11,- Electron microscope.
00:01:11,00:01:12,- Electron microscope.
00:01:12,00:01:14,"- 15 million times magnifying, yeah."
00:01:14,00:01:15,- Got it.
00:01:15,00:01:16,"- Yeah, everyone had that."
00:01:16,00:01:18,It was a very expensive place put on.
00:01:18,00:01:20,"No, this sits on one of those things"
00:01:20,00:01:22,"and they were human sized, played by humans."
00:01:22,00:01:25,And this was reported in Time Magazine
00:01:25,00:01:28,and it was a story that the founder
00:01:28,00:01:32,of the Atomic Energy Association of Great Britain
00:01:32,00:01:34,who was a woman called Muriel Howarth
00:01:34,00:01:38,"was putting on isotopia, which was a ballet"
00:01:38,00:01:42,and the article goes on to describe or review it
00:01:42,00:01:47,saying it was 13 bosomy women girating gracefully
00:01:47,00:01:50,an ample electron in black lace wound her way
00:01:50,00:01:53,around two matrons labeled proton and neutron.
00:01:53,00:01:57,I see because like an electron is like 2000 times smaller
00:01:57,00:01:59,than a neutron.
00:01:59,00:02:01,So they didn't get like a very small person
00:02:01,00:02:04,or a child to be the electron and--
00:02:04,00:02:06,"- It wasn't to scale, no."
00:02:06,00:02:09,- I'm not sure the casting process was as scientific
00:02:09,00:02:11,"as you would like, James, for this."
00:02:11,00:02:14,I'm just getting a vibe that you would have some notes
00:02:14,00:02:15,if you were sitting in as director.
00:02:15,00:02:17,"- I would have notes and they would say,"
00:02:17,00:02:21,"James, you can be the electron 'cause you can so negative."
00:02:23,00:02:24,- It sounds amazing.
00:02:24,00:02:26,I can't tell even from the review whether it was good
00:02:26,00:02:29,or not because the person who wrote the review.
00:02:29,00:02:33,"Well, the person says the 250 wrapped ladies,"
00:02:33,00:02:34,"that means it's good so far,"
00:02:34,00:02:36,and a dozen faintly bored gentlemen.
00:02:36,00:02:40,Faintly bored is a stupid thing to add in a review.
00:02:40,00:02:42,"- Sorry, can I also add what you said there"
00:02:42,00:02:43,didn't quite make sense unless you know
00:02:43,00:02:46,that the word wrapped was spelt R-A-P-T.
00:02:46,00:02:50,"So it wasn't 250 women who are wrapped in,"
00:02:50,00:02:52,"like, you know, but were wrapped possibly."
00:02:52,00:02:54,- They burst out of their gift wrapping
00:02:54,00:02:56,as the grand finale.
00:02:56,00:02:59,"- And sorry, Dan, when Dan said faintly bored gentlemen,"
00:02:59,00:03:01,"he meant bored B-O-R-E-D,"
00:03:01,00:03:04,and not that they were made out of plywood.
00:03:04,00:03:06,"- You see what I mean, it's a confusing review."
00:03:06,00:03:08,"- It's hard, yeah, it's very hard."
00:03:08,00:03:10,I don't think it's been restaged many times.
00:03:10,00:03:11,- No.
00:03:11,00:03:13,- And she wanted it after its debut
00:03:13,00:03:16,"to play at the Albert Hall, which I don't think it did."
00:03:16,00:03:19,"And she said, she's a brilliant woman, Mural Howard."
00:03:19,00:03:20,I'm sure we're gonna talk more about her now.
00:03:20,00:03:22,"She said she wanted it to be at the Albert Hall,"
00:03:22,00:03:26,so they would have room for all the 92 transmutations
00:03:26,00:03:29,"of the atom, which is like the director's cut version,"
00:03:29,00:03:30,so ambitious.
00:03:30,00:03:33,"And she set up loads of atomic bodies, Mural Howard."
00:03:33,00:03:36,And this might have been when she was the Institute
00:03:36,00:03:37,"for Atomic Information, or it might have been"
00:03:37,00:03:41,"its previous guys, the Ladies' Atomic Energy Club,"
00:03:41,00:03:43,which just sounds like such a...
00:03:43,00:03:44,- It sounds like a Richard Usman book.
00:03:44,00:03:45,- It does.
00:03:45,00:03:47,- It sounds like a cute novel.
00:03:47,00:03:48,"- It really does, yeah."
00:03:48,00:03:50,- Did you guys know she did a follow-up to this?
00:03:50,00:03:54,"That there was a musical piece, a piano concerto"
00:03:54,00:03:56,that she did as a follow-up to Isotopia.
00:03:56,00:03:57,"Yeah, it was called Atomica."
00:03:57,00:04:00,And the review of it says it chiefly consisted
00:04:00,00:04:03,"of loud, heavy chords, which indicated atomic bombs"
00:04:03,00:04:05,"and springing, tinkling passages,"
00:04:05,00:04:07,which reflected the extreme surprise
00:04:07,00:04:08,and alarm of the human race.
00:04:08,00:04:10,"- It sounds like what the response would be,"
00:04:10,00:04:12,"but not a great advert, 'cause the whole point of it"
00:04:12,00:04:14,was that she was trying to tell the public
00:04:14,00:04:16,how great atomic energy was.
00:04:16,00:04:21,So she was employed by Atomic Energy to be its PR man.
00:04:21,00:04:25,And the aim of this society was to lead women
00:04:25,00:04:28,out of the kitchen and into the atomic age.
00:04:28,00:04:29,"So she particularly wanted to target women,"
00:04:29,00:04:31,which is why there were all these wrapped women.
00:04:31,00:04:33,"And they're mildly bored husbands, apparently."
00:04:33,00:04:35,But she was amazing.
00:04:35,00:04:36,"- Yeah, extraordinary. - A self-sort completely."
00:04:36,00:04:40,"She was inspired by reading this Nobel Prize winners book,"
00:04:40,00:04:42,guy called Frederick Soddy.
00:04:42,00:04:44,And she was inspired by his statement
00:04:44,00:04:47,"that we could transform a desert continent,"
00:04:47,00:04:50,thaw the frozen poles and make the world
00:04:50,00:04:54,"one smiling garden of Eden using atomic energy,"
00:04:54,00:04:56,which weirdly we have now done and it's not that good.
00:04:56,00:04:59,"But yeah, and she taught herself all about the atom"
00:04:59,00:05:01,and then tried to spread the good word.
00:05:01,00:05:02,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:05:02,00:05:04,"And atomic gardening was the big thing,"
00:05:04,00:05:06,which is probably why isotopia was so much about food.
00:05:06,00:05:07,"It's like early GM,"
00:05:07,00:05:09,but it's incredibly unscientific ways of doing GM.
00:05:09,00:05:12,"Basically, you plant a load of crops in a circle,"
00:05:12,00:05:15,you put a radioactive source in the middle.
00:05:15,00:05:17,"- When you say radioactive source, sorry,"
00:05:17,00:05:18,we're spelling that-- - Yes.
00:05:18,00:05:21,"- 'Cause that's genuine possible confusion, isn't it?"
00:05:21,00:05:23,"I think. - Yeah, I suppose so."
00:05:23,00:05:25,"Yeah, a source of radiation."
00:05:25,00:05:26,Does that clear it up?
00:05:26,00:05:27,Not much.
00:05:27,00:05:28,"Anyway, there's some radioactive stuff"
00:05:28,00:05:29,in the middle of the pie chart
00:05:29,00:05:31,and then all the plants near it--
00:05:31,00:05:34,- Was this a physical pie? - Or was this like a--
00:05:34,00:05:36,"- Gee, was--"
00:05:36,00:05:37,"- Sorry, go on, Andy."
00:05:37,00:05:40,"- Yeah, no one else got any amusing homophones."
00:05:40,00:05:41,They wanna bust out.
00:05:41,00:05:42,- When you say homophones.
00:05:42,00:05:43,- Oh my God.
00:05:43,00:05:45,(all laughing)
00:05:45,00:05:47,"So you put your gamma radiation right in the middle,"
00:05:47,00:05:49,and the plants that are nearest to the seedlings
00:05:49,00:05:52,get completely blasted and they just die.
00:05:52,00:05:55,And then the ones further out get tumors.
00:05:55,00:05:57,"And the ones further out than that,"
00:05:57,00:05:58,"on the outer edge of the pie chart,"
00:05:58,00:06:00,get a load of mutations.
00:06:00,00:06:04,And those mutations might be useful in some ways.
00:06:04,00:06:06,So they might make the plant stronger
00:06:06,00:06:07,or they might make it more resistant
00:06:07,00:06:09,to particular kinds of blight.
00:06:09,00:06:11,And you just do thousands of experiments
00:06:11,00:06:13,"and they produce thousands of new varieties of plants,"
00:06:13,00:06:14,some of which I think are still in use today.
00:06:14,00:06:18,The mutations actually worked for agriculture.
00:06:18,00:06:20,"- Absolutely, like the peppermint oil,"
00:06:20,00:06:22,"any peppermint oil which you have today,"
00:06:22,00:06:22,"which you might think,"
00:06:22,00:06:24,"""Well, I don't really have much peppermint oil,"""
00:06:24,00:06:26,but actually it's in loads of foods that you get
00:06:26,00:06:28,as like a very minor ingredient
00:06:28,00:06:31,that was invented by atomic gardening.
00:06:31,00:06:33,"It's in toothpaste and stuff like that, for instance."
00:06:33,00:06:35,But she became famous for inventing
00:06:35,00:06:38,the world's first atomic peanut.
00:06:38,00:06:39,Didn't she?
00:06:39,00:06:42,"- Yeah, she made this radioactive peanut,"
00:06:42,00:06:45,"which germinated in four days and grew two feet tall,"
00:06:45,00:06:47,which apparently is quite big for a peanut.
00:06:47,00:06:49,"That's a peanut plant, not the peanuts."
00:06:49,00:06:52,"- Yeah, 'cause the peanut itself,"
00:06:52,00:06:54,"disappointingly, as I read in the reviews,"
00:06:54,00:06:56,was the size of an almond.
00:06:56,00:06:57,"- Yes, yeah."
00:06:57,00:06:58,- Which is like--
00:06:58,00:06:59,- That's a huge peanut.
00:06:59,00:07:01,"In the peanut world, that's big."
00:07:01,00:07:02,"Yeah, absolutely."
00:07:02,00:07:04,That's double or triple a normal peanut.
00:07:04,00:07:05,- It is quite good.
00:07:05,00:07:07,"But you do get jumbo peanuts these days,"
00:07:07,00:07:09,which I don't think are irradiated.
00:07:09,00:07:10,"- I want a peanut the size of a person,"
00:07:10,00:07:12,"but sorry, ruined it."
00:07:12,00:07:13,(laughing)
00:07:13,00:07:15,- If you look at all the pictures
00:07:15,00:07:17,"in the newspapers at the time,"
00:07:17,00:07:20,"she's there, a picture of her with her peanut,"
00:07:20,00:07:21,"which looks a bit like an almond,"
00:07:21,00:07:24,"'cause obviously the pictures aren't great either,"
00:07:24,00:07:25,so you can't really see what she's doing.
00:07:25,00:07:28,But that was when she first really got in the newspapers
00:07:28,00:07:29,and became big.
00:07:29,00:07:31,And then she started trying to do all of these
00:07:31,00:07:34,publicity stunts of which the ballet was won.
00:07:34,00:07:38,"And one of them was she cooked a roast dinner,"
00:07:38,00:07:40,"English roast dinner of beef, vegetables,"
00:07:40,00:07:43,"Yorkshire pudding, potatoes, and onions."
00:07:43,00:07:46,"But the potatoes and onions were three years old,"
00:07:46,00:07:49,so they'd been irradiated and they were absolutely fine
00:07:49,00:07:50,"after three years, that was her opinion."
00:07:50,00:07:51,- It's brilliant.
00:07:51,00:07:52,- It's so good.
00:07:52,00:07:53,"That must have been revolutionary,"
00:07:53,00:07:54,like time travel cuisine.
00:07:54,00:07:56,"- Yeah, it must have been amazing,"
00:07:56,00:07:58,but apparently it didn't taste of anything.
00:07:58,00:07:59,"- Right, okay."
00:07:59,00:08:00,- 'Cause once you'd irradiated them
00:08:00,00:08:02,"and kept them for three years,"
00:08:02,00:08:04,any kind of taste in this potato or onion
00:08:04,00:08:06,had just disappeared completely.
00:08:06,00:08:08,"If you're cooking with onions,"
00:08:08,00:08:10,and they've often been in the back of your pantry
00:08:10,00:08:11,"for a bit of time,"
00:08:11,00:08:13,"I mean, do you need to irradiate it"
00:08:13,00:08:14,to serve three-year-old onions?
00:08:14,00:08:17,I reckon I've probably tried to cook myself
00:08:17,00:08:19,an onion verging on that.
00:08:19,00:08:21,"You know, and you get the soft bits off,"
00:08:21,00:08:24,and sometimes there's a bit that's salvageable.
00:08:24,00:08:26,I'm not sure you needed to go through all of that trouble.
00:08:26,00:08:27,Do you know what I mean?
00:08:27,00:08:29,"- I know exactly what you mean,"
00:08:29,00:08:31,having known you for 15 years.
00:08:31,00:08:32,"- And never come for dinner at my house,"
00:08:32,00:08:34,despite multiple invitations.
00:08:35,00:08:38,- Another cool thing that she did is that
00:08:38,00:08:39,"she put a message out saying,"
00:08:39,00:08:41,"""I need people to help me with this."""
00:08:41,00:08:43,"And if you want to get involved,"
00:08:43,00:08:44,"get in contact,"
00:08:44,00:08:45,"and if anyone did get in contact,"
00:08:45,00:08:47,she sent them seeds through the post.
00:08:47,00:08:48,"And to encourage it,"
00:08:48,00:08:51,she launched the Muriel Howarth Peanut Prize
00:08:51,00:08:54,to the best mutant things each year.
00:08:54,00:08:55,But we don't actually know whether or not
00:08:55,00:08:56,"anyone was awarded it,"
00:08:56,00:08:59,"because again, it was so hard to find these mutants."
00:08:59,00:09:00,- Really?
00:09:00,00:09:00,- Yeah.
00:09:00,00:09:01,- Wow.
00:09:01,00:09:02,- I didn't know that.
00:09:02,00:09:04,- Either that or someone created a mutant plant
00:09:04,00:09:06,"so vicious, it ate all of them."
00:09:06,00:09:07,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:09:07,00:09:09,- The evidence was destroyed.
00:09:09,00:09:12,She used to carry a potato around in her pocket.
00:09:12,00:09:14,That wasn't just any potato.
00:09:14,00:09:16,It was an irradiated potato.
00:09:16,00:09:17,- Did she?
00:09:17,00:09:18,(laughing)
00:09:18,00:09:19,- What?
00:09:19,00:09:20,- That was a publicity stunt.
00:09:20,00:09:21,And I-
00:09:21,00:09:23,"- It's not very good publicity if it's in your pocket,"
00:09:23,00:09:25,unless you have a transparent pocket.
00:09:25,00:09:26,"- Well, she had it very obvious,"
00:09:26,00:09:29,"and she used to open with a chat-up line,"
00:09:29,00:09:31,"""You know, I am not just pleased to see you."
00:09:31,00:09:33,"It's actually an irradiated potato in my pocket."""
00:09:33,00:09:34,(laughing)
00:09:34,00:09:36,"- So, good retention."
00:09:36,00:09:38,- Have I ever said that in the old days
00:09:38,00:09:40,"of crown green bowling in Lancashire,"
00:09:40,00:09:43,"this was at the turn of the 20th century,"
00:09:43,00:09:45,the bowlers would often keep a jacket potato
00:09:45,00:09:46,in their pockets?
00:09:46,00:09:48,- Like a hot water bottle?
00:09:48,00:09:49,- Why?
00:09:49,00:09:49,"- Exactly, yeah."
00:09:49,00:09:50,"- Oh, wow."
00:09:50,00:09:51,"- So it would be to keep your hands warm,"
00:09:51,00:09:53,"so you'd have a jacket potato in your pocket,"
00:09:53,00:09:55,"and whenever your hands got cold,"
00:09:55,00:09:56,"'cause it's always cold in Lancashire,"
00:09:56,00:09:58,"you would put your hands in your pocket,"
00:09:58,00:10:00,"warm them up, that would be good for the game,"
00:10:00,00:10:02,"and then when there was a break in the game,"
00:10:02,00:10:03,you could eat the jacket potato.
00:10:03,00:10:04,- Wow.
00:10:04,00:10:05,"- There must have been a lot of either, A,"
00:10:05,00:10:07,amusing mishaps where people accidentally threw
00:10:07,00:10:10,"the potato along the pitch,"
00:10:10,00:10:14,"or B, a lot of arrests for suspected masturbation."
00:10:14,00:10:16,(laughing)
00:10:16,00:10:19,"No, it's, we know the potato's in your other pocket,"
00:10:19,00:10:20,but we know that.
00:10:20,00:10:22,(laughing)
00:10:22,00:10:24,"Can we say on how, there is a fantastic source,"
00:10:24,00:10:26,"if you do want to read more about atomic gardening,"
00:10:26,00:10:28,there's a website called atomicgardening.com.
00:10:28,00:10:30,I think it's run by someone called Paige Johnson.
00:10:30,00:10:31,"- Yes, that's right."
00:10:31,00:10:32,"- Who is kind of the,"
00:10:32,00:10:34,"I don't know if she's the official or unofficial,"
00:10:34,00:10:37,but she is the historian on this subject.
00:10:37,00:10:39,It's so interesting.
00:10:39,00:10:40,- Definitely.
00:10:40,00:10:41,- She's just kind of found everything
00:10:41,00:10:43,"about Howarth over the years, and yeah, it's very cool."
00:10:43,00:10:44,- Yeah.
00:10:44,00:10:45,"- And in fact, one thing she found"
00:10:45,00:10:47,"that I couldn't find where she got it from,"
00:10:47,00:10:50,she wrote that Muriel Howarth also patented
00:10:50,00:10:52,an early picture and sound recording device
00:10:52,00:10:53,called the talky phone.
00:10:53,00:10:54,- Did she?
00:10:54,00:10:55,- Oh.
00:10:55,00:10:56,"- Yeah, she did."
00:10:56,00:10:57,- She was extraordinary.
00:10:57,00:10:59,She was a science fiction writer as well.
00:10:59,00:11:00,She was putting these concertos together.
00:11:00,00:11:02,She was an all-rounder.
00:11:02,00:11:04,"And I thought the story was gonna end,"
00:11:04,00:11:09,"and this is part of the bad branding of nuclear power,"
00:11:09,00:11:11,"that, oh, she would have got really ill"
00:11:11,00:11:13,"off the back of this and eventually died,"
00:11:13,00:11:14,"and that's why we don't do it anymore,"
00:11:14,00:11:15,but that didn't happen.
00:11:15,00:11:16,This was safe.
00:11:16,00:11:18,"This was safe for her. - I was wondering, Dan,"
00:11:18,00:11:21,do you think that she was so prolific
00:11:21,00:11:24,because she'd had a bit of radiation in her body?
00:11:24,00:11:28,Maybe there was a big circle of Muriel Howarth's
00:11:28,00:11:30,"with a radioactive source in the middle,"
00:11:30,00:11:32,and she was just at the right position
00:11:32,00:11:34,"where she got the right blast of radiation,"
00:11:34,00:11:36,and it made her a superhero.
00:11:36,00:11:38,- That's so exciting.
00:11:38,00:11:39,"I hadn't considered that,"
00:11:39,00:11:42,and that's all I'm gonna take away from this show now.
00:11:42,00:11:44,- So what's happened to all the other Muriel Howarths
00:11:44,00:11:47,"who are kind of weird, mutant-formed,"
00:11:47,00:11:49,"gigantic, or minuscule green?"
00:11:49,00:11:50,- She's eaten them.
00:11:50,00:11:52,She's eaten them as something to provide flavor
00:11:52,00:11:55,next to these awful potatoes and onions.
00:11:55,00:12:00,- They are the bad guys in the Muriel Howarth comic book.
00:12:00,00:12:01,"- Oh, that's such a good idea."
00:12:01,00:12:02,"Wait, and it's called, sorry,"
00:12:02,00:12:05,"the comic book is called The Ladies' Atomic Energy Club,"
00:12:05,00:12:07,and it's about all the ladies are Muriel Howarth
00:12:07,00:12:11,"who've been replicated, and they've got different skills."
00:12:11,00:12:13,One of them's got 19 legs.
00:12:13,00:12:14,"- One writes piano concertos,"
00:12:14,00:12:16,the other writes science fiction novels.
00:12:16,00:12:19,"- Can I just say, it seems like quite often"
00:12:19,00:12:20,"we come up with these brilliant ideas,"
00:12:20,00:12:23,"but no one at Hollywood has gotten in touch with us yet,"
00:12:23,00:12:25,"so maybe they're getting our email wrong or something,"
00:12:25,00:12:29,but it's podcast@qi.com if anyone wants to give us
00:12:29,00:12:30,a million quits about that.
00:12:30,00:12:31,- I think that's true.
00:12:31,00:12:32,I think maybe they assume that we've got them in development
00:12:32,00:12:35,"through our own, obviously, massive production company,"
00:12:35,00:12:36,"and they just think, oh, well, those guys have thought"
00:12:36,00:12:39,of whatever stupid thing we've come up with this week.
00:12:39,00:12:44,"This was all kind of the pro atomic energy movement,"
00:12:44,00:12:46,"wasn't it, saying, actually,"
00:12:46,00:12:48,this thing was invented for war.
00:12:48,00:12:50,"It's very, very powerful, but it can be used for peace."
00:12:50,00:12:53,"It can provide electricity and power that's much cleaner,"
00:12:53,00:12:55,"doesn't cause carbon emissions, all that,"
00:12:55,00:12:57,and I just find it interesting.
00:12:57,00:12:59,"I had no idea how big the early movement was,"
00:12:59,00:13:02,"so I read a great interview with a,"
00:13:02,00:13:04,"she's a poet, actually, called Deborah Greger,"
00:13:04,00:13:06,"and she grew up in a place called Hanford, Washington,"
00:13:06,00:13:09,which is where the Manhattan Project was partly based.
00:13:09,00:13:11,It was where the first plutonium reactor
00:13:11,00:13:13,"in the world was cited, right?"
00:13:13,00:13:16,And it was such a culture of pro atomic energy.
00:13:16,00:13:19,High school football team was called the Richland Bombers.
00:13:19,00:13:20,The cheerleaders for the football team
00:13:20,00:13:23,had a four foot high nuclear bomb painted
00:13:23,00:13:25,"in the school colors, which they would dance around"
00:13:25,00:13:26,at halftime.
00:13:26,00:13:28,And this is so cool.
00:13:28,00:13:30,"Once a month, her dad came back from work"
00:13:30,00:13:32,"with a case, right, special suitcase,"
00:13:32,00:13:34,"and it had two glass bottles in it,"
00:13:34,00:13:36,and his job was to fill the bottles with urine
00:13:36,00:13:39,and leave them out on the front doorstep.
00:13:39,00:13:40,"- Oh, really?"
00:13:40,00:13:42,"- And it was so he could be tested for any,"
00:13:42,00:13:44,"if he'd had too much radiation exposure,"
00:13:44,00:13:46,at his job at the power plant.
00:13:46,00:13:48,"- So was there a postman, specifically,"
00:13:48,00:13:51,whose job was to come and collect two vials of urine?
00:13:51,00:13:54,"- I think it may be milkman, though."
00:13:54,00:13:55,"Because you've got the space on,"
00:13:55,00:13:57,"if you've dropped two bottles of milk off,"
00:13:57,00:13:59,you've got a space for two urine bottles.
00:13:59,00:14:01,"- Yep, that's it."
00:14:01,00:14:03,"And the milk fairy, the urine fairy, comes around."
00:14:03,00:14:05,"- Yeah, you don't--"
00:14:05,00:14:06,- You don't want to mix up those orders.
00:14:06,00:14:07,"- Yeah, you don't want to."
00:14:07,00:14:08,"- Hang on, I've submitted the full-fat milk"
00:14:08,00:14:10,to the testing facility.
00:14:10,00:14:11,(laughing)
00:14:11,00:14:13,"- What's up, my colleagues?"
00:14:13,00:14:15,(upbeat music)
00:14:15,00:14:21,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two,"
00:14:21,00:14:22,and that is Andy.
00:14:22,00:14:26,"My fact is that, in 1340, at the beginning"
00:14:26,00:14:27,"of the Hundred Years' War,"
00:14:27,00:14:30,Edward III challenged King Philip VI of France
00:14:30,00:14:33,to settle who was the rifle heir to the French throne
00:14:33,00:14:35,by exposing themselves to hungry lions.
00:14:35,00:14:37,(laughing)
00:14:37,00:14:38,"- Now, let's go through these words."
00:14:38,00:14:40,"Exposing yourself, can you define that, please?"
00:14:40,00:14:42,(laughing)
00:14:42,00:14:44,"- What a good point, what a good point."
00:14:44,00:14:46,"Sorry, you would basically put yourself in a room"
00:14:46,00:14:49,"with a hungry lion, or a cage, or whatever."
00:14:49,00:14:51,"And the idea, obviously,"
00:14:51,00:14:53,a lion will never attack a true king.
00:14:53,00:14:56,So this was like just a great acid test
00:14:56,00:14:58,"for who's the real king, let's find out."
00:14:58,00:14:59,- Has anyone told the lion this?
00:14:59,00:15:01,(laughing)
00:15:01,00:15:03,"- Well, exactly, it's so weird."
00:15:03,00:15:06,"- That is amazing, I wonder, at this stage,"
00:15:06,00:15:08,"it's a little bit like the Cold War,"
00:15:08,00:15:10,where you've got two people
00:15:10,00:15:12,who could mutually kill each other.
00:15:12,00:15:15,"You know, if Philip calls his bluff,"
00:15:15,00:15:16,then they're both dead.
00:15:16,00:15:19,"'Cause they both have to go and stand in front of lions,"
00:15:19,00:15:20,and they're both dead.
00:15:20,00:15:22,"- You're right, and it is lion's plural,"
00:15:22,00:15:25,so it feels like there's gonna be one lion for each of them.
00:15:25,00:15:28,"- Maybe they believe, I think maybe they both go in"
00:15:28,00:15:30,"with one lion, and then the lion will have to attack"
00:15:30,00:15:33,"one of them first, and then the other one just runs for it."
00:15:33,00:15:34,"Right, it's me, I'm the king, I'm the king."
00:15:34,00:15:37,(laughing)
00:15:37,00:15:39,Your servants will try and sneakily rub him with meat
00:15:39,00:15:42,"before you go in, so that's the game as well."
00:15:42,00:15:43,- Do you think they did that thing
00:15:43,00:15:47,where boys used to hide their willy in their bum cracks
00:15:47,00:15:50,so that the lion couldn't see it?
00:15:50,00:15:54,"I don't think the lion is going for the penis, per se."
00:15:54,00:15:57,"- Anna, what do you think the costume choices are for this?"
00:15:57,00:15:58,Why are you...
00:15:58,00:15:59,(laughing)
00:15:59,00:16:02,"- Oh my goodness, they're exposing themselves to the lions."
00:16:02,00:16:03,"Wait, sorry."
00:16:03,00:16:05,"- I'm sorry, I don't think that's traditionally"
00:16:05,00:16:09,where you put it where you hide it in your bum crack.
00:16:09,00:16:09,I'm sorry.
00:16:09,00:16:11,"- This is when you're pretending,"
00:16:11,00:16:12,"well, I don't know, 'cause I'm not a man,"
00:16:12,00:16:15,"but when you're pretending to have a vagina,"
00:16:15,00:16:16,don't you hide it in your bum crack?
00:16:16,00:16:18,"- Between your legs, yeah, I would say more like that."
00:16:18,00:16:21,- Between your legs was a normal traditional phrase.
00:16:21,00:16:21,- Yeah.
00:16:21,00:16:22,(laughing)
00:16:22,00:16:23,- Anna.
00:16:23,00:16:25,- You don't actually tuck it in inside your anus.
00:16:25,00:16:26,(laughing)
00:16:26,00:16:28,- Can we please get back to the 100 years ago?
00:16:28,00:16:30,"- I'm going to imagine Philip going,"
00:16:30,00:16:32,"all right, Edward, fine, we're gonna do it."
00:16:32,00:16:33,"Fine, we're gonna do it."
00:16:33,00:16:34,Where's the lion?
00:16:34,00:16:35,"It's in that room, fine, okay."
00:16:35,00:16:38,"And then Edward goes, okay, pats off."
00:16:38,00:16:39,Penis in bum crack.
00:16:39,00:16:41,(laughing)
00:16:41,00:16:44,- Can you imagine if we had BBC live news coverage back there?
00:16:44,00:16:45,"Well, they're both in the room."
00:16:45,00:16:46,(laughing)
00:16:46,00:16:47,King Edward appears to be doing
00:16:47,00:16:50,"the most curious thing he's kinda tucking his,"
00:16:50,00:16:52,pushing his penis into his anus.
00:16:52,00:16:54,(laughing)
00:16:54,00:16:56,"Anna, Anna."
00:16:56,00:16:58,- I don't know what I've done and I'm so sorry.
00:16:58,00:17:00,"- I'm sorry, this is horrible."
00:17:00,00:17:02,"Right, can we get back to the horrific conflict"
00:17:02,00:17:04,"which killed thousands and, you know, lasted a century?"
00:17:04,00:17:05,- I just got a quick question.
00:17:05,00:17:08,Did anyone find where this was an idea
00:17:08,00:17:08,"that came from, the idea of those?"
00:17:08,00:17:09,"- Yes, sorry."
00:17:09,00:17:12,"Well, it's just a traditional belief of King Lee,"
00:17:12,00:17:14,"you know, you're chosen by God."
00:17:14,00:17:15,"So that this, I should say, this fact came in."
00:17:15,00:17:17,It was based on a fact that was sent by Daniel Parrish
00:17:17,00:17:19,'cause he heard us talking about scroffula
00:17:19,00:17:21,and he has done a lot of research into that
00:17:21,00:17:23,and there's an academic treatise called
00:17:23,00:17:26,The Royal Touch in Early Modern England by Stephen Brogan
00:17:26,00:17:29,and both of them did touching for scroffula.
00:17:29,00:17:30,- Yeah.
00:17:30,00:17:32,- Both Edward the Third and Philip the Sixth
00:17:32,00:17:34,touched people who had scroffula
00:17:34,00:17:35,and hopefully they'd be cured.
00:17:35,00:17:36,"You know, that was the idea of Monarchs"
00:17:36,00:17:37,had the power to do that.
00:17:37,00:17:39,- Yeah.
00:17:39,00:17:41,- And that was another of the elements of the challenge
00:17:41,00:17:43,was that Edward also challenged Philip the Sixth.
00:17:43,00:17:46,"He said, ""Look, we can either have trial by combat,"
00:17:46,00:17:48,"""we can expose ourselves to lions,"
00:17:48,00:17:49,"""or we can have a touch off"
00:17:49,00:17:51,"""and we'll just touch as many people"
00:17:51,00:17:53,"""as we can for scroffula and whoever wins,"
00:17:53,00:17:56,"""who cures the most people, they're the true King of France."""
00:17:56,00:17:57,- Yeah.
00:17:57,00:17:58,- So it's a way of avoiding this whole war.
00:17:58,00:17:59,"You know, we've got a big dispute"
00:17:59,00:18:01,about who should be in charge of France.
00:18:01,00:18:02,Let's find out.
00:18:02,00:18:04,And these were the methods that were proposed.
00:18:04,00:18:06,- And did Philip the Sixth turn them all down
00:18:06,00:18:08,"and say, ""I'd rather just do more than 100 years more."""
00:18:08,00:18:09,"- Yeah, he didn't go for it,"
00:18:09,00:18:12,which implies that he sort of knew maybe actually
00:18:12,00:18:13,he shouldn't be King of France.
00:18:13,00:18:16,"- Yeah, or maybe they should have a King of France"
00:18:16,00:18:19,who doesn't think that lions are just gonna randomly
00:18:19,00:18:21,not attack you because you're a king.
00:18:21,00:18:24,(laughing)
00:18:24,00:18:25,"But yeah, 100 years war."
00:18:25,00:18:27,"England being France, more than 100 years."
00:18:27,00:18:29,"I think that's a classic QI thing, right?"
00:18:29,00:18:31,- 116.
00:18:31,00:18:33,- We're talking roughly. - 116 years.
00:18:33,00:18:37,"But basically, England owned loads of bits of France"
00:18:37,00:18:39,and there was a big old fight
00:18:39,00:18:41,about how much they should own
00:18:41,00:18:42,and how much they shouldn't own.
00:18:42,00:18:43,Is that right?
00:18:43,00:18:45,- A lot of people in France thought none
00:18:45,00:18:48,and a lot of people in England thought some.
00:18:48,00:18:50,- Who actually is England and who is France here?
00:18:50,00:18:54,Lots of the French dukes sided with the English crown.
00:18:54,00:18:57,"It's all very, it's very confusing."
00:18:57,00:18:59,"- In a lot of ways, France wasn't really"
00:18:59,00:19:01,a coalesced nation until it was over.
00:19:01,00:19:03,And my theory is that the whole of the 100 years war
00:19:03,00:19:05,was just about wine
00:19:05,00:19:10,because it was triggered when Philip the Sixth confiscated
00:19:10,00:19:13,"Aquitaine, which is region that was owned by the English,"
00:19:13,00:19:15,confiscated it from Edward the Third.
00:19:15,00:19:19,So it was in Gascony and Gascony was crucial to England
00:19:19,00:19:23,because it contained Bordeaux and it made Claret.
00:19:23,00:19:27,And England imported so much Claret.
00:19:27,00:19:30,"So by the 14th century, I think Bordeaux"
00:19:30,00:19:33,was sending Britain enough wine for every single person
00:19:33,00:19:35,"in Britain, including children,"
00:19:35,00:19:37,to have six bottles each a year.
00:19:37,00:19:39,"And suddenly Philip the Sixth said,"
00:19:39,00:19:40,"""You can't have that region anymore."""
00:19:40,00:19:42,"And the English said, ""Well, what are we gonna do"
00:19:42,00:19:43,"""about our wine?"""
00:19:43,00:19:45,And that's what caused it.
00:19:45,00:19:48,And I think that's the most justified cause for war.
00:19:48,00:19:51,"- 'Cause the Gascons, they were like,"
00:19:51,00:19:55,"""Oh, well, we're kind of happy being like friends"
00:19:55,00:19:58,"""with the English because they're quite a long way away"
00:19:58,00:20:00,"""and you have to get past the Bay of Biscay"
00:20:00,00:20:02,"""and over the channel and they're not gonna come"
00:20:02,00:20:04,"""and bother us and we don't really want to be friends"
00:20:04,00:20:06,"""with these French people who are right next door"
00:20:06,00:20:08,"""who might start taxing us more"
00:20:08,00:20:10,"""or might start invading us and whatever."""
00:20:10,00:20:12,"- I didn't realize, and I'm saying this more"
00:20:12,00:20:15,as someone who doesn't have a good grasp of English history
00:20:15,00:20:17,"and 100 years of war and stuff like that,"
00:20:17,00:20:19,"but I didn't realize that in this period,"
00:20:19,00:20:22,French was basically the language of the upper class
00:20:22,00:20:26,in the UK and English was the working class language.
00:20:26,00:20:30,"And so that's why there was, as you say Anna,"
00:20:30,00:20:31,it was sort of a bit confusing.
00:20:31,00:20:34,And there was also the inheritance of the crown in France.
00:20:34,00:20:38,"Anyway, it wasn't there with Philip becoming king,"
00:20:38,00:20:41,but he wasn't a direct descendant of the king
00:20:41,00:20:43,and Charles thought he had a closer connection
00:20:43,00:20:45,and should be the rightful heir.
00:20:45,00:20:47,So there was that as well as the wine.
00:20:47,00:20:49,- Edward thought he had a rightful connection.
00:20:49,00:20:50,"- Sorry, that's what I meant."
00:20:50,00:20:51,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:20:51,00:20:53,"- I think that's true, actually."
00:20:53,00:20:55,"As in, if you just go straight off"
00:20:55,00:20:57,"that whoever's related the most closely,"
00:20:57,00:20:59,Edward was definitely the most closely related.
00:20:59,00:21:01,"But the French barons, they wanted Philip"
00:21:01,00:21:04,"because he was one of them, really."
00:21:04,00:21:05,That was a thing.
00:21:05,00:21:08,But Edward's lineage came through his mother
00:21:08,00:21:11,who was Isabella the she-wolf of France.
00:21:11,00:21:12,- She's incredible.
00:21:12,00:21:14,- Why would you not want someone who's called
00:21:14,00:21:17,Isabella the she-wolf to be the mother of the king?
00:21:17,00:21:17,"Well, you know."
00:21:17,00:21:20,"- Well, Isabella was the one who,"
00:21:20,00:21:23,"she was Edward's mother,"
00:21:23,00:21:26,"but she had overthrown his father, her husband,"
00:21:26,00:21:29,"Edward II, possibly thanks to shoving"
00:21:29,00:21:31,a red hot poker up his arse.
00:21:31,00:21:32,- That probably not really.
00:21:32,00:21:35,"- Probably not, but definitely due to her"
00:21:35,00:21:37,"picking up a lover, Roger Mortimer,"
00:21:37,00:21:39,and deciding to take over England.
00:21:39,00:21:41,- Was the red hot poker up the arse
00:21:41,00:21:45,"a, that was an aggressive thing, an enjoyable thing?"
00:21:45,00:21:46,- It might have been enjoyable
00:21:46,00:21:48,"at the very beginning of the situation,"
00:21:48,00:21:51,"but certainly by the end, he wasn't enjoying it."
00:21:51,00:21:52,"- Right, okay."
00:21:52,00:21:53,"- It's like, isn't that a bit of,"
00:21:53,00:21:56,"it's sort of a bit of later homophobic propaganda,"
00:21:56,00:21:57,"isn't it, that thing of 'cause--"
00:21:57,00:21:58,- I just think so.
00:21:58,00:22:00,"- 'Cause Edward II took a male lover who was,"
00:22:00,00:22:01,"I can't remember his name now,"
00:22:01,00:22:03,but he was-- - Hey.
00:22:03,00:22:04,"- I've just finished David Mitchell's book,"
00:22:04,00:22:06,"which goes into great detail about the, you know--"
00:22:06,00:22:09,"- Dispenser, Hugh Dispenser, is he called?"
00:22:09,00:22:10,- Hugh Dispenser.
00:22:10,00:22:11,- I think so.
00:22:11,00:22:12,- That's a funny name.
00:22:12,00:22:13,(laughing)
00:22:13,00:22:14,"Oh no, Piers Gavaston."
00:22:14,00:22:16,- Piers Gavaston?
00:22:16,00:22:17,"He had terrible reflux, didn't he?"
00:22:17,00:22:19,"- They were both, oh God,"
00:22:19,00:22:21,"I think they were both rumoured,"
00:22:21,00:22:22,"certainly rumoured to be,"
00:22:22,00:22:23,basically the problem was that
00:22:23,00:22:25,Edward II was a big at choosing favourites
00:22:25,00:22:28,and was very bad at distributing favours
00:22:28,00:22:29,"in a kind of equitable manner,"
00:22:29,00:22:31,"so lots of people got very aggrieved about that,"
00:22:31,00:22:33,and clearly then Isabella enters the scene.
00:22:33,00:22:36,- And the other thing about putting a red hot poker
00:22:36,00:22:39,of the bum is that it doesn't leave any obvious scars
00:22:39,00:22:42,unless you take a good old look at the bum.
00:22:42,00:22:45,"So you can kill someone, theoretically,"
00:22:45,00:22:48,"and they might think that they died of something,"
00:22:48,00:22:49,an illness.
00:22:49,00:22:51,"- Nah, until you look at the look on their face,"
00:22:51,00:22:52,in death.
00:22:52,00:22:53,(laughing)
00:22:53,00:22:55,"- I'm surprised that you're a poker truther on this, James."
00:22:55,00:22:56,- What?
00:22:56,00:22:58,"- I think it's not, I think it didn't happen."
00:22:58,00:22:59,"I think, I mean, Khaliba's bumped off."
00:22:59,00:23:00,"- Oh, sorry, I'm not saying it happened,"
00:23:00,00:23:03,I'm just saying that that is part of the propaganda
00:23:03,00:23:05,is that they say this is why.
00:23:05,00:23:08,- There seems to be a through line of arses
00:23:08,00:23:09,"in the Hundred Years War,"
00:23:09,00:23:11,"because there was that,"
00:23:11,00:23:12,"which fair enough is in the lead up to it,"
00:23:12,00:23:14,"there was obviously the original fact,"
00:23:14,00:23:16,"and then there was the fact that in 1346,"
00:23:16,00:23:17,"so very early on,"
00:23:17,00:23:20,"on the way to the Battle of Klesi,"
00:23:20,00:23:22,"which was one of the sort of biggest,"
00:23:22,00:23:25,"most important battles of the Hundred Years War,"
00:23:25,00:23:28,the Norman soldiers exposed their backsides
00:23:28,00:23:30,"to Edward III's archers,"
00:23:30,00:23:32,"and according to reports,"
00:23:32,00:23:34,this pissed off the English so much
00:23:34,00:23:36,that they basically launched an ill-advised attack.
00:23:36,00:23:38,- They decided to win the battle instead of...
00:23:38,00:23:40,(laughing)
00:23:40,00:23:41,"- No, they launched an ill-advised attack,"
00:23:41,00:23:42,"which they lost,"
00:23:42,00:23:44,because they were so offended by the bear arses.
00:23:44,00:23:45,- That's interesting.
00:23:45,00:23:47,"- Sorry, Anna, can I just quickly check?"
00:23:47,00:23:48,"When you say there's a lot of arses,"
00:23:48,00:23:49,"and you say the original fact,"
00:23:49,00:23:51,are you including your new theory
00:23:51,00:23:54,that they were shoving their penises up their anus?
00:23:54,00:23:56,"- No, this is too much, no."
00:23:56,00:23:58,- She said the original fact.
00:23:58,00:23:59,"- I know, it's nothing to do with the original fact."
00:23:59,00:24:00,This is Anna's first little...
00:24:00,00:24:01,"- It's not, sorry, sorry."
00:24:01,00:24:02,It's my reading of the original fact
00:24:02,00:24:04,where they exposed themselves
00:24:04,00:24:06,"in a flashing kind of way, yes."
00:24:06,00:24:08,- One person in the Battle of Klesi
00:24:08,00:24:10,was blind King John of Bohemia.
00:24:10,00:24:11,He was there to support...
00:24:11,00:24:13,"- So he wouldn't have been affected by the mooning,"
00:24:13,00:24:16,"to be fair, he was the one person who was immune to it."
00:24:16,00:24:19,- He was actually on the side of the mooners.
00:24:19,00:24:21,"He was on Philip's side,"
00:24:21,00:24:23,"but he'd had a bout of ophthalmia,"
00:24:23,00:24:26,which meant that at the time he couldn't really see anything.
00:24:26,00:24:30,"So he asked two of his knights to be on either side of him,"
00:24:30,00:24:33,"while he was sort of strapped to his horse,"
00:24:33,00:24:35,and the two knights went towards the battle
00:24:35,00:24:37,"while he was in between them,"
00:24:37,00:24:38,so that he knew exactly that he was going
00:24:38,00:24:40,in the right direction.
00:24:40,00:24:42,"- Good Lord, that is very brave."
00:24:42,00:24:44,"King John, you are allowed to sit this one out, it's fine."
00:24:44,00:24:46,No one will think any less of you
00:24:46,00:24:47,if you don't fight today.
00:24:47,00:24:48,"- No, no, I'm here now."
00:24:48,00:24:51,"- No, Grace, no."
00:24:51,00:24:52,"- Well, obviously the English won it."
00:24:52,00:24:54,"- Oh, did the English win the Battle of Cressy?"
00:24:54,00:24:55,"- Yeah, they did."
00:24:55,00:24:59,"- James, of course the English won the battle, I'm sorry."
00:24:59,00:25:01,"- Auntie, your outrage there is embarrassing."
00:25:01,00:25:03,"You're Scottish anyway, Auntie,"
00:25:03,00:25:04,you should be on the French side.
00:25:04,00:25:05,- England only won about three battles
00:25:05,00:25:06,"in the Hundred Years' War,"
00:25:06,00:25:08,and they were definitely tilted towards the start.
00:25:08,00:25:12,"It was as in court, Cressy, sluice, sluice."
00:25:12,00:25:13,- Yeah.
00:25:13,00:25:15,- Where the French fleet was sunk.
00:25:15,00:25:17,"No, if Britain had just,"
00:25:17,00:25:18,England had just kind of sued for peace
00:25:18,00:25:19,"after the first 30 years,"
00:25:19,00:25:22,"they'd had a completely cracking first 30 years to the war,"
00:25:22,00:25:23,"and then after the,"
00:25:23,00:25:24,it was kind of gradually all downhill
00:25:24,00:25:26,"for the next sort of 70, 80 years."
00:25:26,00:25:28,It didn't go well for them after that.
00:25:28,00:25:29,It is classic.
00:25:29,00:25:32,"- Oh yeah, but Agincourt was a pretty good ending."
00:25:32,00:25:33,- That was right towards the end.
00:25:33,00:25:35,It was like a late goal.
00:25:35,00:25:37,- And I think the French would object to you
00:25:37,00:25:38,"calling Agincourt an ending,"
00:25:38,00:25:41,"given that when it did end, it was very much."
00:25:41,00:25:44,"- It was 30 years after the Battle of Agincourt,"
00:25:44,00:25:47,and the French won the whole war over.
00:25:47,00:25:48,- The Battle of Sluice was interesting
00:25:48,00:25:50,"because this was a naval battle,"
00:25:50,00:25:52,"and the English fleet came up,"
00:25:52,00:25:53,"and there was,"
00:25:53,00:25:56,they were kind of maneuvering to get to the best angle
00:25:56,00:25:57,because of the wind and stuff like that.
00:25:57,00:25:58,"And when they were maneuvering,"
00:25:58,00:26:01,"the French got entangled with each other,"
00:26:01,00:26:03,"all the different boats,"
00:26:03,00:26:04,"'cause they were ready,"
00:26:04,00:26:07,"but then because it didn't start straight away,"
00:26:07,00:26:09,they kind of all sort of bumped into each other
00:26:09,00:26:10,and all got really entangled.
00:26:10,00:26:13,- The French actually chained their boats together.
00:26:13,00:26:17,"Sometimes there seemed to be a tactic that worked,"
00:26:17,00:26:19,"but it certainly wasn't in this instance,"
00:26:19,00:26:21,"because, as you say, it meant they got entangled,"
00:26:21,00:26:24,so basically a ship couldn't go to the aid of another ship
00:26:24,00:26:25,'cause they were literally attached together.
00:26:25,00:26:27,"It was like doing a three-legged race,"
00:26:27,00:26:30,but with 100 people all attached to each other in the race.
00:26:30,00:26:32,- It's a bit like playing foosball.
00:26:32,00:26:33,"It's like, it's fine."
00:26:33,00:26:36,"As long as the ball is right next to one of your players,"
00:26:36,00:26:37,"you can spin around and kick it,"
00:26:37,00:26:38,"but as soon as the ball goes anywhere,"
00:26:38,00:26:40,"not near your players, you're fucked."
00:26:40,00:26:41,- And that's why football teams
00:26:41,00:26:43,"tend to not chain themselves together, isn't that right?"
00:26:43,00:26:46,"I don't watch a lot, but that is, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:26:46,00:26:48,"I like this theory, okay, there's a theory"
00:26:48,00:26:49,that actually the Hundred Years War
00:26:49,00:26:52,really lasted from 1066 until 1904.
00:26:52,00:26:55,Just a millennium of Anglo-French conflict
00:26:55,00:26:57,"happened basically, kicking off, obviously,"
00:26:57,00:26:58,"with the Battle of Hastings,"
00:26:58,00:27:01,and then the 1904 was when the Entente-Cordial agreements
00:27:01,00:27:03,"were signed between England and France,"
00:27:03,00:27:05,which really bonded them very closely together.
00:27:05,00:27:07,"- Yeah. - There was so much conflict, you know."
00:27:07,00:27:11,"- Do you think, Andy, like, obviously we are allies now,"
00:27:11,00:27:13,but there were peace treaties signed
00:27:13,00:27:15,"all over those thousand years,"
00:27:15,00:27:17,and there's no reason to think that in 500 years
00:27:17,00:27:20,there won't be another battle between England and France.
00:27:20,00:27:23,"So in that case, with the Hundred Years War,"
00:27:23,00:27:23,go on for the rest of the day.
00:27:23,00:27:25,- You think this might be a long lull?
00:27:25,00:27:26,"- That's what I was thinking, yeah."
00:27:26,00:27:30,"- I hope, oh gosh, I do hope not, 'cause I love France."
00:27:30,00:27:31,"- Yeah, me too."
00:27:31,00:27:32,"- But look, it's possible."
00:27:32,00:27:35,"- I actually like it a little bit too much,"
00:27:35,00:27:37,"and I'm thinking that, you know,"
00:27:37,00:27:40,that area around Bordeaux is very nice.
00:27:40,00:27:41,"- Do you think maybe, James,"
00:27:41,00:27:44,you might actually have a claim to Gascony?
00:27:44,00:27:47,- I do drink a lot of wine.
00:27:47,00:27:48,"- You might, you know."
00:27:48,00:27:49,- Just give it a try.
00:27:49,00:27:51,"A little foray, never hurt anyone."
00:27:51,00:28:00,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:28:00,00:28:01,and that is my fact.
00:28:01,00:28:03,My fact this week is that Buzz Aldrin's dad
00:28:03,00:28:06,once got so angry that his son wasn't featured
00:28:06,00:28:09,on a US post stamp commemorating the moon landing
00:28:09,00:28:11,that he went and stood outside the White House
00:28:11,00:28:15,"holding a placard that read, ""My son was first too."""
00:28:15,00:28:19,So it's the ultimate embarrassing dad move.
00:28:19,00:28:20,- It is demented.
00:28:20,00:28:23,This is such a weird thing to do.
00:28:23,00:28:24,- Why?
00:28:24,00:28:26,"I just think, take the win."
00:28:26,00:28:27,That your son has been the second man
00:28:27,00:28:31,"to walk on the moon, just, he's not on the stamp."
00:28:31,00:28:32,- Who cares?
00:28:32,00:28:33,"- It's odd, but I actually think so."
00:28:33,00:28:36,"Buzz Aldrin's dad, Edwin Aldrin Sr.,"
00:28:36,00:28:39,"the buzzer's real name is Edwin, he's a junior."
00:28:39,00:28:40,I have a bit of sympathy for him
00:28:40,00:28:43,because I think basically he is
00:28:43,00:28:45,one of the most extraordinary characters
00:28:45,00:28:49,that we've had in relation to airplanes and rockets
00:28:49,00:28:50,and so on.
00:28:50,00:28:53,"This is a guy who was literally buddies with Orville Wright,"
00:28:53,00:28:54,knew the Wright brother.
00:28:54,00:28:57,He marries a woman who is with us.
00:28:57,00:28:58,- The Wright brother.
00:28:58,00:29:00,You can't say the Wright brother.
00:29:00,00:29:03,It's either the Wright brothers or A Wright brother.
00:29:03,00:29:04,- He is A Wright brother.
00:29:04,00:29:06,- The other one's the wrong brother.
00:29:06,00:29:11,- So he's buddies with Orville Wright of the Wright brothers.
00:29:11,00:29:13,He happens to be flying with a guy
00:29:13,00:29:14,who's surname is Moon.
00:29:14,00:29:17,He marries a woman who is called Marion Moon.
00:29:17,00:29:19,"His son then goes on to stand on the moon,"
00:29:19,00:29:22,but really he's also kind of the reason
00:29:22,00:29:23,that we got to the moon.
00:29:23,00:29:25,It's because he was very good friends
00:29:25,00:29:29,"with a rocket engineer called Goddard, right?"
00:29:29,00:29:31,Goddard is the one who basically got us to the moon.
00:29:31,00:29:34,He's the one who was so key to inventing
00:29:34,00:29:36,the rocket power that we needed to get there
00:29:36,00:29:37,and he didn't have funding.
00:29:37,00:29:39,And that was a huge problem.
00:29:39,00:29:41,"So Edwin Aldrin Sr., he knows him"
00:29:41,00:29:43,because he studied under Goddard
00:29:43,00:29:45,and he's also an influential guy in that world.
00:29:45,00:29:48,"He sets up a meeting with Lindbergh,"
00:29:48,00:29:49,"first to fly the Atlantic,"
00:29:49,00:29:51,"in which he basically says,"
00:29:51,00:29:53,are you able to get Goddard the funding
00:29:53,00:29:55,that he needs in order to go on?
00:29:55,00:29:57,He goes to the Guggenheim Foundation
00:29:57,00:29:58,and manages to get the money.
00:29:58,00:30:02,So Edwin Aldrin Sr. literally made the funding happen
00:30:02,00:30:03,in order for us to get to the moon.
00:30:03,00:30:05,So I can see why he's pissed off
00:30:05,00:30:08,'cause he's literally the linchpin to all these elements.
00:30:08,00:30:09,"- I know what you mean, Dan,"
00:30:09,00:30:11,but you've introduced him in this section
00:30:11,00:30:14,as the guy who stood with a placard
00:30:14,00:30:15,as an embarrassing dad.
00:30:15,00:30:17,"- It's definitely an embarrassing dad move,"
00:30:17,00:30:20,"no matter what, but I can see his reasoning."
00:30:20,00:30:21,"- No, come up with something better,"
00:30:21,00:30:23,"like my son was there too,"
00:30:23,00:30:25,or my son also went to the moon.
00:30:25,00:30:28,He said my son was first too.
00:30:28,00:30:30,It's the only thing that's not true.
00:30:30,00:30:34,"- Can I just say, this is in 1969, right?"
00:30:34,00:30:36,The stamp is issued.
00:30:36,00:30:39,Aldrin himself clearly was a bit
00:30:39,00:30:41,narked about it because he had to go
00:30:41,00:30:42,to the unveiling of the stamp.
00:30:42,00:30:44,"Aldrin wrote in his memoir,"
00:30:44,00:30:47,"""I smiled rather weakly when I first saw the stamp,"
00:30:47,00:30:48,"""though it was a bittersweet honor."""
00:30:48,00:30:49,"I mean, come on."
00:30:49,00:30:52,Michael Collins' thoughts about this are not registered.
00:30:52,00:30:54,Michael Collins is nowhere even near this stamp.
00:30:54,00:30:56,Didn't kick up half the fuss.
00:30:56,00:31:00,"Also, it's not Neil Armstrong on the stamp, right?"
00:31:00,00:31:05,You are not allowed to commemorate the living on stamps.
00:31:05,00:31:09,"So logically, it can't be Neil Armstrong on this stamp."
00:31:09,00:31:13,- So is it not like a famous image of him?
00:31:13,00:31:14,- I think it's a drawing of a photo.
00:31:14,00:31:15,- It's a drawing of the photo.
00:31:15,00:31:16,- A drawing.
00:31:16,00:31:18,"- At some point between the photo and the drawing,"
00:31:18,00:31:20,Neil Armstrong has been replaced by a generic man.
00:31:20,00:31:23,And this got controversial when they released
00:31:23,00:31:25,"an anniversary stamp some years later,"
00:31:25,00:31:27,"'cause many thought that it portrayed Armstrong and Aldrin,"
00:31:27,00:31:28,"who were alive at the time,"
00:31:28,00:31:31,and that has two astronauts on it facing the camera.
00:31:31,00:31:33,But they've got the helmets up with the visor
00:31:33,00:31:34,so you can't see.
00:31:34,00:31:37,- And the US Postal Service never admitted to breaking the law
00:31:37,00:31:38,forbidding the portrayal of living people.
00:31:38,00:31:41,They just said these are generic astronauts
00:31:41,00:31:44,"to commemorate these two people who were real,"
00:31:44,00:31:45,who landed on the moon.
00:31:45,00:31:46,It's such a fudge.
00:31:46,00:31:47,- It's definitely a fudge
00:31:47,00:31:51,when you've literally drawn a picture of a specific person.
00:31:51,00:31:55,"Yeah, I would say that Edwin's at least justified in that."
00:31:55,00:31:58,- I read an article that was in the newspaper archives
00:31:58,00:32:01,"that came out the weekend after they landed on the moon,"
00:32:01,00:32:04,where they spoke to all the families and stuff like that.
00:32:04,00:32:08,And we've said before that Buzz had communion on the moon.
00:32:08,00:32:10,But I didn't know this.
00:32:10,00:32:13,"At the same time as he was taking communion on the moon,"
00:32:13,00:32:15,"in his church back home,"
00:32:15,00:32:17,they were taking the same communion
00:32:17,00:32:18,with the same bit of bread.
00:32:18,00:32:19,- No.
00:32:19,00:32:22,- So the priest had gotten this big bit of bread
00:32:22,00:32:25,and broken a bit off and given one piece of it to Buzz.
00:32:25,00:32:28,"And at the exact same time-ish,"
00:32:28,00:32:29,they did their own communion.
00:32:29,00:32:32,"And the priest said, ""This loaf is not complete."
00:32:32,00:32:33,"""Now we shall commune with him."
00:32:33,00:32:35,"""He is one of us."""
00:32:35,00:32:36,And they're referring to Buzz.
00:32:36,00:32:38,And they had to get extra seats in the church
00:32:38,00:32:41,because so many people wanted to come to this communion.
00:32:41,00:32:44,And they all had Bibles donated by Buzz
00:32:44,00:32:46,that were inscribed with his mother's name
00:32:46,00:32:47,'cause actually Buzz's mother died
00:32:47,00:32:49,before he got to the moon.
00:32:49,00:32:50,"- It was the year before, wasn't it?"
00:32:50,00:32:52,"- Yeah, it was May 1968."
00:32:52,00:32:54,And she took her own life.
00:32:54,00:32:57,"And according to Buzz, the reason that she did that"
00:32:57,00:33:01,is because she couldn't handle the stress of the fame
00:33:01,00:33:03,and notoriety that he was gaining
00:33:03,00:33:05,from being an astronaut that was going to the moon.
00:33:05,00:33:07,"He says it was mixed with other stuff,"
00:33:07,00:33:08,but that was a big factor.
00:33:08,00:33:11,What a weird thing to take with you
00:33:11,00:33:12,"as you're about to go off to the moon,"
00:33:12,00:33:15,that you lost your mom for the reason of the mission.
00:33:15,00:33:18,"- Yeah, Marian Gladys Moon was her name."
00:33:18,00:33:20,And it was 'cause he'd done the Gemini mission.
00:33:20,00:33:21,So he was actually super famous
00:33:21,00:33:24,before he went to the moon off the back of that.
00:33:24,00:33:26,"And sweetly, Buzz Aldrin did,"
00:33:26,00:33:28,"I realized kind of looking into him,"
00:33:28,00:33:29,he's always mentioning the fact
00:33:29,00:33:31,that his mother's maiden name was Moon.
00:33:31,00:33:34,"I suppose you would, because it's an incredible fact,"
00:33:34,00:33:37,"but he does in any autobiography or interview,"
00:33:37,00:33:40,"or anything like that, he will say, or he'll tweet it"
00:33:40,00:33:43,"and say, yep, mother's maiden name was Moon."
00:33:43,00:33:43,Who would have thought?
00:33:43,00:33:46,"- Yeah, and he was in this newspaper article that I read,"
00:33:46,00:33:50,"he was called the World Spacewalking Champion, they said."
00:33:50,00:33:52,"And the other person on the moon is Buzz Aldrin,"
00:33:52,00:33:54,the World Spacewalking Champion.
00:33:54,00:33:55,(laughing)
00:33:55,00:33:56,"- Not the first though, was he?"
00:33:56,00:33:58,- He wasn't the first on the moon.
00:33:58,00:34:01,"- He'd spent five hours outside Gemini 12,"
00:34:01,00:34:04,which meant that he'd been out in space on his own
00:34:04,00:34:05,for longer than any other person.
00:34:05,00:34:07,"I think Leonov was the first, wasn't he?"
00:34:07,00:34:09,"- Just back to the moon and families for a second,"
00:34:09,00:34:12,"there was a lot of stuff that was left on the moon,"
00:34:12,00:34:15,which was related to the family members of the astronauts.
00:34:15,00:34:19,Some initials were sort of put into the moon dust
00:34:19,00:34:22,"that will be sitting there for many, many, many, many years"
00:34:22,00:34:24,unless they're disturbed by future missions
00:34:24,00:34:26,or meteorite hits or whatever.
00:34:26,00:34:28,There was a photo that was left of one of the families.
00:34:28,00:34:30,So all these little beautiful little mementos.
00:34:30,00:34:32,"And there's actually, and I hadn't heard of this before,"
00:34:32,00:34:35,but there is a mystery about Neil Armstrong and the moon.
00:34:35,00:34:37,And that is a missing 10 minutes
00:34:37,00:34:41,where Neil went off-coms and stood by a crater
00:34:41,00:34:43,just for 10 minutes on his own.
00:34:43,00:34:46,"And there's a lot of, there's a lot of conjecture"
00:34:46,00:34:48,about what he did in that 10 minutes.
00:34:48,00:34:51,- I reckon he put his penis into his bubble.
00:34:51,00:34:52,(laughing)
00:34:52,00:34:54,"Stop, I've walked around and said,"
00:34:54,00:34:56,"""I'm the first woman on the moon."""
00:34:56,00:34:59,(laughing)
00:34:59,00:35:02,- I think he just felt the hot jacket potato
00:35:02,00:35:05,he brought with him in his space suit
00:35:05,00:35:08,and warmed his hands up on that cold landscape.
00:35:08,00:35:10,- I think he stared into outer space
00:35:10,00:35:13,and surveyed the enormity of what he was achieving
00:35:13,00:35:15,"and representing, okay?"
00:35:15,00:35:17,And stuck his penis in his bum crack.
00:35:17,00:35:18,(laughing)
00:35:18,00:35:19,- Oh my God.
00:35:19,00:35:23,"- Yeah, no, so there's a,"
00:35:23,00:35:25,"it's to do with family is one of the biggest theories,"
00:35:25,00:35:28,which is the fact that he very tragically lost a daughter
00:35:28,00:35:30,who was two years old at the time.
00:35:30,00:35:34,And there was a bracelet that he had with her name on it.
00:35:34,00:35:37,"And the thought is, is that he left that on the moon."
00:35:37,00:35:39,He chucked that into the crater.
00:35:39,00:35:42,"And James Hansen, who is the official biographer"
00:35:42,00:35:45,"of Neil Armstrong, desperately tried to prove this."
00:35:45,00:35:47,"And he could never get it out of Neil,"
00:35:47,00:35:49,whether or not it happened.
00:35:49,00:35:51,"His family sort of said, ""I hope it happened,"""
00:35:51,00:35:52,but they weren't quite sure themselves.
00:35:52,00:35:56,And so it's remained an unanswered question.
00:35:56,00:35:57,"- When the moon landing happened,"
00:35:57,00:36:02,"there was a protest in America at the same time,"
00:36:02,00:36:04,"not by Buzz Aldrin's father,"
00:36:04,00:36:08,"but by 25 families, African-American families"
00:36:08,00:36:11,who walked to Kennedy Space Center
00:36:11,00:36:13,because they said it was a distorted sense
00:36:13,00:36:17,of national priorities that America was going to the moon.
00:36:17,00:36:19,"Because at the time,"
00:36:19,00:36:22,the poverty rate for African-Americans was 31%.
00:36:22,00:36:27,"And for black people living on farms, it was 62%."
00:36:27,00:36:30,"And so they said, ""Well, why are you spending all this money"
00:36:30,00:36:32,on the space race when you have people living in poverty
00:36:32,00:36:34,"in your own country?"""
00:36:34,00:36:37,"And the Victoria Maris,"
00:36:37,00:36:40,"who was the head of the poverty program in Michigan,"
00:36:40,00:36:43,she said that the Apollo project was akin to a man
00:36:43,00:36:45,who has a large family.
00:36:45,00:36:47,"They have no shoes, no clothing, no food,"
00:36:47,00:36:49,"and the rent is overdue, but when he gets paid,"
00:36:49,00:36:53,he runs out and buys himself another set of electric trains.
00:36:53,00:36:58,"- Oh, slam on people who just enjoy some nice train."
00:36:58,00:37:01,(laughing)
00:37:01,00:37:05,"I got to say, I sympathize with that guy getting his trains."
00:37:05,00:37:06,- But you've got to stop keeping your wife
00:37:06,00:37:08,"in poverty, Andy, there's no reason."
00:37:08,00:37:09,(laughing)
00:37:09,00:37:11,"- And the New York Amsterdam News,"
00:37:11,00:37:13,"which was one of the leading black newspapers at the time,"
00:37:13,00:37:17,"had the headline, ""Yesterday, the moon, tomorrow, maybe us."""
00:37:18,00:37:20,"So it wasn't, and actually the space program--"
00:37:20,00:37:21,"- Oh, what, they'll be spending money on us?"
00:37:21,00:37:23,"- Yeah, precisely."
00:37:23,00:37:25,"And actually until 1969,"
00:37:25,00:37:29,pretty much the space program wasn't universally liked.
00:37:29,00:37:32,"In fact, possibly not even 50% liked in America,"
00:37:32,00:37:34,"'cause a lot of people were like,"
00:37:34,00:37:35,"""Well, why are we wasting money on this"
00:37:35,00:37:37,"when there's problems at home?"""
00:37:37,00:37:38,"And it was really only when everyone,"
00:37:38,00:37:40,"when they walked on the moon,"
00:37:40,00:37:43,that the kind of opinion changed in America.
00:37:43,00:37:44,"- Yeah, there's a really nice description."
00:37:44,00:37:46,"One of the best books ever,"
00:37:46,00:37:48,"I think about the Apollo missions is a book called ""Moon Dust"","
00:37:48,00:37:50,"if anyone is interested in this subject,"
00:37:50,00:37:51,"listening by Andrew Smith,"
00:37:51,00:37:53,"and he talks about all these protests,"
00:37:53,00:37:55,"and sort of the reaction,"
00:37:55,00:37:58,"literally as the rocket was going into space,"
00:37:58,00:37:59,"the mood changed,"
00:37:59,00:38:03,"everyone suddenly was on board in support of it,"
00:38:03,00:38:06,"not everyone, but large groups that were protesting,"
00:38:06,00:38:07,"suddenly just couldn't help,"
00:38:07,00:38:10,but see the majesty of what we were doing as humanity.
00:38:10,00:38:13,"So yeah, it's pretty amazing."
00:38:13,00:38:15,"- So we know on the side of your falling on Dan,"
00:38:15,00:38:16,you think send money to the moon missions
00:38:16,00:38:19,"rather than people in poverty, okay."
00:38:19,00:38:21,- I think send poor people to the moon.
00:38:21,00:38:25,That's how we just put them off Earth and we'll be fine.
00:38:25,00:38:28,"- Interesting, oh, I see."
00:38:28,00:38:29,"I was gonna say, interestingly,"
00:38:29,00:38:33,that was kind of how the Soviets chose their cosmonauts
00:38:33,00:38:35,is that they tried to find people
00:38:35,00:38:37,who were born into poor backgrounds.
00:38:37,00:38:38,"'Cause obviously it was very,"
00:38:38,00:38:40,"yeah, it was very good with their narrative,"
00:38:40,00:38:42,"which was, you know, we're all together,"
00:38:42,00:38:44,"and if you grew up on a communal farm,"
00:38:44,00:38:48,then you're just as good as anyone else in the country.
00:38:48,00:38:50,"- I thought you were gonna say, obviously it was very easy,"
00:38:50,00:38:51,which it would have been in the Soviet Union
00:38:51,00:38:53,"at that time to find people with poor backgrounds, but."
00:38:53,00:38:55,"- Certainly was, true."
00:38:55,00:38:56,"Gagarin was born,"
00:38:56,00:38:58,"Yuri Gagarin, who was the first man in space,"
00:38:58,00:39:01,was born in a town called Gagarin.
00:39:01,00:39:02,- Oh.
00:39:02,00:39:05,- But it was named after him after his death.
00:39:05,00:39:07,(both laughing)
00:39:07,00:39:10,"But yeah, he was brought up on a collective farm,"
00:39:10,00:39:14,"and his mother had been a factory worker in World War II,"
00:39:14,00:39:16,and this was like a perfect sort of background
00:39:16,00:39:18,for a cosmonaut.
00:39:18,00:39:20,"Toreshkova, Valentina Toreshkova,"
00:39:20,00:39:23,"who was the first woman in space,"
00:39:23,00:39:26,she was born in a town which has a population of nine.
00:39:26,00:39:27,- Wow. - Wow.
00:39:27,00:39:28,- Do we call it a town? - Wow.
00:39:28,00:39:30,"- Yeah, it's officially a town."
00:39:30,00:39:31,- Wow. - But she was working
00:39:31,00:39:33,in a textile mill. - Really?
00:39:33,00:39:35,"- And eventually did some correspondence courses,"
00:39:35,00:39:37,and then became a cosmonaut.
00:39:37,00:39:40,So they really wanted to get people
00:39:40,00:39:42,from other backgrounds into space.
00:39:42,00:39:43,"- I'm really interested that you said that,"
00:39:43,00:39:44,'cause it certainly is interesting.
00:39:44,00:39:46,Researching cosmonauts and astronauts
00:39:46,00:39:50,is striking how all the astronauts from America
00:39:50,00:39:52,"at the time had quite similar upbringings,"
00:39:52,00:39:54,"very successful parents,"
00:39:54,00:39:55,often in the aeronautical industry.
00:39:55,00:39:59,All Soviet cosmonauts were quite gritty upbringings.
00:39:59,00:40:00,"I mean, Gagarin and his family"
00:40:00,00:40:04,lived in a three meter square mud hut during the war
00:40:04,00:40:07,because their property was taken over by Nazis.
00:40:07,00:40:10,"On the one hand, Gagarin rebelled against the Nazis"
00:40:10,00:40:11,"who were occupying his land,"
00:40:11,00:40:15,and he used to pour soil in the Nazi soldiers' tank batteries
00:40:15,00:40:19,and kind of mix up their chemicals to foil their plans.
00:40:19,00:40:23,"And then I was reading that later on,"
00:40:23,00:40:25,"when he was famous, a famous cosmonaut,"
00:40:25,00:40:27,"he got a scar on his forehead,"
00:40:27,00:40:29,which you can see in later pictures.
00:40:29,00:40:33,And it's from 1961 when he was on holiday
00:40:33,00:40:36,"with his wife and a bunch of other people,"
00:40:36,00:40:37,and they were playing cards.
00:40:37,00:40:39,"And he said, I'm going to bed,"
00:40:39,00:40:42,"his wife said, I'm just going to finish this hand."
00:40:42,00:40:43,"You know, I'll be there in a sec."
00:40:43,00:40:46,He used this spare time to go into the hotel room
00:40:46,00:40:48,of one of the other women who was a nurse
00:40:48,00:40:52,"who was staying in the hotel, tried to check her,"
00:40:52,00:40:54,and then his wife walked down the corridor
00:40:54,00:40:56,"having finished her hand a couple of minutes later,"
00:40:56,00:40:58,"saying, where are you, Yuri?"
00:40:58,00:41:00,And so he legged it off the balcony
00:41:00,00:41:02,"of this nurse's room to escape,"
00:41:02,00:41:04,split his head open on the tarmac.
00:41:04,00:41:09,And that's the glorious story of the first Russian
00:41:09,00:41:11,in space's scar.
00:41:11,00:41:12,- Amazing. - How do I get this?
00:41:12,00:41:13,"Fighting Nazis, actually."
00:41:13,00:41:16,(laughing)
00:41:16,00:41:19,"Would you like to talk to an alien,"
00:41:19,00:41:21,assuming that the alien can speak your language
00:41:21,00:41:23,and your safety is guaranteed?
00:41:23,00:41:24,- Yes. - Would you like to
00:41:24,00:41:25,"meet an alien? - Yeah, I would."
00:41:25,00:41:27,"- Okay, don't do that, yeah."
00:41:27,00:41:28,"- Is this an offer, Andy?"
00:41:28,00:41:30,"- It's not an offer, it's a survey from YouGov."
00:41:30,00:41:31,This was done last year.
00:41:31,00:41:34,"21% of people said, no, I would not, thank you very much."
00:41:34,00:41:37,Even if we can speak the same language and I'm safe.
00:41:37,00:41:41,"14% don't know, I don't know."
00:41:41,00:41:43,- I more can't understand the nose.
00:41:43,00:41:45,"That is absolutely, are they too busy?"
00:41:45,00:41:47,Did we get the reasons?
00:41:47,00:41:48,"- Maybe if you're religious,"
00:41:48,00:41:51,you don't want the answers that are gonna ruin things for you.
00:41:51,00:41:52,Maybe.
00:41:52,00:41:55,"- Well, there was that, I won't say who it was, Dan,"
00:41:55,00:41:58,but a very famous person who we offered
00:41:58,00:42:01,to come on the Museum of Curiosity when--
00:42:01,00:42:02,- When Buzz was on.
00:42:02,00:42:05,- When Buzz Aldrin came on and Dan emailed them
00:42:05,00:42:06,"and said, would you like, come on,"
00:42:06,00:42:09,you can meet the second person who walks on the moon
00:42:09,00:42:10,"and that person wrote back saying,"
00:42:10,00:42:11,"no, I don't really like space."
00:42:11,00:42:13,"- Yeah, not really into space."
00:42:13,00:42:16,- Can you bleep out and say who it was now?
00:42:16,00:42:17,(beep)
00:42:17,00:42:18,- Get out.
00:42:18,00:42:19,- Yeah.
00:42:19,00:42:21,"- You're going back going, I'm such a nice space,"
00:42:21,00:42:25,"not really my thing, but thanks for the offer."
00:42:25,00:42:27,"- I'm staggered, I'm staggered."
00:42:27,00:42:29,"- Yeah, it was incredible."
00:42:29,00:42:30,- That's shocking.
00:42:30,00:42:34,"- So that person, I reckon probably would be one of the 20%."
00:42:34,00:42:35,- Yeah.
00:42:35,00:42:36,- I agree.
00:42:36,00:42:39,"- Dairy-like aliens, not my thing, I'm interested."
00:42:39,00:42:40,"- Yeah, no, thank you."
00:42:40,00:42:42,(upbeat music)
00:42:42,00:42:48,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show"
00:42:48,00:42:50,and that is James.
00:42:50,00:42:53,"- Okay, my fact this week is if you go to the Arctic"
00:42:53,00:42:57,"at the right time, you can view huge herds of moss balls"
00:42:57,00:43:00,migrating across the plains.
00:43:00,00:43:01,- Magnificent.
00:43:01,00:43:05,"- Now, if you do go there to see the migrating moss balls,"
00:43:05,00:43:09,we should say migrating at a speed that you would expect.
00:43:09,00:43:12,It's probably a bit of a misleading idea.
00:43:12,00:43:15,"These are, if your trip is for seven years,"
00:43:15,00:43:18,you might see it move a good foot or baby.
00:43:18,00:43:21,"- If you're really eagle-eyed,"
00:43:21,00:43:22,they move about an inch a day.
00:43:22,00:43:23,- Yeah.
00:43:23,00:43:27,"- It's not the quickest migration ever, but you know,"
00:43:27,00:43:28,it's not bad for a moss.
00:43:28,00:43:30,- It is astonishing as well.
00:43:30,00:43:32,It is astonishing when you see photos of these things
00:43:32,00:43:34,and the fact that they herd together
00:43:34,00:43:37,and they turn left together and they move forward together.
00:43:37,00:43:38,It's insane.
00:43:38,00:43:41,"- So this is research by a couple of researchers,"
00:43:41,00:43:44,one of whom I was reading about called Tim Bartholomus
00:43:44,00:43:49,and he described them as bright green in a world of white.
00:43:49,00:43:51,"In the 1950s, when they were first described,"
00:43:51,00:43:54,there was a nice landed guy who called them Glacier mice.
00:43:54,00:43:57,"So that gives you kind of an idea of what they look like,"
00:43:57,00:43:58,but they're bright green.
00:43:58,00:44:02,"And if you look at them, they seem like they're not moving,"
00:44:02,00:44:04,"but actually they're very, very slowly moving"
00:44:04,00:44:07,and they all move in the same direction.
00:44:07,00:44:08,And they don't all move with the wind.
00:44:08,00:44:12,They don't all move because sunlight is melting bits of ice
00:44:12,00:44:13,and it's moving them.
00:44:13,00:44:15,They don't move.
00:44:15,00:44:16,There's various different theories.
00:44:16,00:44:17,- Angle of slopes.
00:44:17,00:44:18,"- Yeah, they don't go downhill."
00:44:18,00:44:20,We don't know why they do it
00:44:20,00:44:21,and we don't know how they do it.
00:44:21,00:44:23,"And every time we come up with a theory,"
00:44:23,00:44:24,someone disproves it.
00:44:24,00:44:25,- Aliens?
00:44:25,00:44:27,Has anyone talked about the aliens?
00:44:27,00:44:29,"- No, actually these are part of the 20%"
00:44:29,00:44:30,that don't really like aliens.
00:44:30,00:44:32,(laughing)
00:44:32,00:44:34,"- And the other brilliant thing is this scientist,"
00:44:34,00:44:36,"one of the ones, Tim Bartholomew,"
00:44:36,00:44:38,I think he's Tim Bartholomew mouse
00:44:38,00:44:39,and these are Glacier mice.
00:44:39,00:44:41,"- No, that's true."
00:44:41,00:44:42,- Yes.
00:44:42,00:44:43,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:44:43,00:44:44,- It is actually quite confusing when you read about them
00:44:44,00:44:46,'cause they're very commonly referred to
00:44:46,00:44:49,in the few things that have been written about them as mice.
00:44:49,00:44:51,And so you keep having to remind yourself halfway through
00:44:51,00:44:53,"whatever the New York Times article when it says,"
00:44:53,00:44:55,"""And within the mice, it's extremely warm"
00:44:55,00:44:57,"""and lots of insects live."
00:44:57,00:44:58,"""They're not actually mice."
00:44:58,00:44:59,"""They're not actually mice."""
00:44:59,00:44:59,- It was the plural of moss.
00:44:59,00:45:00,- The plural of moss is mice.
00:45:00,00:45:01,That's the other thing.
00:45:01,00:45:02,(laughing)
00:45:02,00:45:03,- Of course.
00:45:03,00:45:04,- Yeah.
00:45:04,00:45:04,"The guy who discovered these in the '50s,"
00:45:04,00:45:07,"John Aetherson, he pointed out that"
00:45:07,00:45:11,rolling stones can gather moss.
00:45:11,00:45:12,"'Cause in the middle of all,"
00:45:12,00:45:13,"at the heart of all of these mice,"
00:45:13,00:45:15,there might be a tiny bit of gravel
00:45:15,00:45:17,or a bit of something that it's formed around
00:45:17,00:45:18,and the moss has grown around.
00:45:18,00:45:19,And it's more like you get moss
00:45:19,00:45:21,that gathers and rolls over stones.
00:45:21,00:45:23,"Actually, really."
00:45:23,00:45:24,"But either way, it's gorgeous."
00:45:24,00:45:26,They're kind of like little mossy tumbleweed in a way.
00:45:26,00:45:27,- Yeah.
00:45:27,00:45:30,"- I love the idea, the imagery of the pedestals"
00:45:30,00:45:31,that they sit on.
00:45:31,00:45:33,"If you catch them at the right time,"
00:45:33,00:45:34,"let's say you come across a herd,"
00:45:34,00:45:37,they might all be perched up as if they're on plinths.
00:45:37,00:45:41,Because they're covering a very specific bit of the ice
00:45:41,00:45:42,"with the mossy ball itself,"
00:45:42,00:45:44,the ice will remain because they're insulating it
00:45:44,00:45:46,or rather keeping it cold.
00:45:46,00:45:48,"So you end up seeing what looks genuinely,"
00:45:48,00:45:50,"I think, Anna, to your point,"
00:45:50,00:45:52,"like you'd be like, ""Is this aliens?"
00:45:52,00:45:52,"""What is going on here?"
00:45:52,00:45:54,"""Has some weird artist come out here"
00:45:54,00:45:56,"""and just carved around these balls"
00:45:56,00:45:58,"""and left them for just to find?"""
00:45:58,00:46:02,And one of the thoughts is that then it rolls down the hill
00:46:02,00:46:04,for what it's created off this pedestal
00:46:04,00:46:05,and they all roll at the same time.
00:46:05,00:46:08,- So that was one of the theories.
00:46:08,00:46:10,"But again, this quite recent study"
00:46:10,00:46:13,where they put trackers inside the mice
00:46:13,00:46:16,kind of disproved this theory of the pedestals.
00:46:16,00:46:18,"Not that they exist 'cause they definitely do,"
00:46:18,00:46:19,but there's something else happening
00:46:19,00:46:22,because it's not like they're staying in one place
00:46:22,00:46:24,and then moving.
00:46:24,00:46:28,They're kind of every day on average moving about an inch.
00:46:28,00:46:31,"- And I love as well that this guy, Bartholomeus,"
00:46:31,00:46:34,"he's, the way they tracked it is they just put little bits"
00:46:34,00:46:36,of like small wire around the moss balls
00:46:36,00:46:39,in different colors so they could see which one was which.
00:46:39,00:46:42,"And he's been going back occasionally to see them,"
00:46:42,00:46:43,but now he doesn't know where they are.
00:46:43,00:46:45,He's lost his moss balls.
00:46:45,00:46:49,And that's extraordinary that whole herd
00:46:49,00:46:50,has gone missing on him.
00:46:50,00:46:52,"- If that moss ball can outrun you,"
00:46:52,00:46:55,"then you need to be taking more exercise, Bartholomeus."
00:46:55,00:46:58,"- Can I read you a bit of romantic,"
00:46:58,00:47:01,just a brief romantic passage about these things?
00:47:01,00:47:02,- Did you write it?
00:47:02,00:47:05,"- No, thankfully, don't worry, I didn't."
00:47:05,00:47:06,"- Okay, then yeah."
00:47:06,00:47:07,- This is about the other scientists
00:47:07,00:47:09,in this recent paper who studied these things.
00:47:09,00:47:10,"Sophie Gilbert, she's a biologist."
00:47:10,00:47:13,"And the University of Alaska website says,"
00:47:13,00:47:17,they met in 2006 studying at the Wrangel Mountains Center.
00:47:17,00:47:18,Right?
00:47:18,00:47:19,And this is it.
00:47:19,00:47:22,In this expansive setting of a gorgeous ice plateau
00:47:22,00:47:23,"between high mountains,"
00:47:23,00:47:27,the pair noticed more than just tufts of moss.
00:47:27,00:47:29,She saw a handsome young leader
00:47:29,00:47:30,who wanted to solve glacier problems.
00:47:30,00:47:33,"He saw an attractive, worldly biologist"
00:47:33,00:47:36,"who loved being outside, powered by flirty energy."
00:47:36,00:47:39,They started thinking about how to study these moss balls
00:47:39,00:47:40,and they're married now.
00:47:40,00:47:41,(laughing)
00:47:41,00:47:44,- Do you think it was the bowls that made them horny?
00:47:44,00:47:47,"- I don't know what prompted the spark to the romance,"
00:47:47,00:47:51,but I love the idea of proposing with a little moss ball
00:47:51,00:47:54,that you open up and the ring is in there.
00:47:54,00:47:55,That would be nice.
00:47:55,00:47:57,And there's also another guy called Hotterling
00:47:57,00:47:58,"about whom little is related,"
00:47:58,00:48:01,but he's the third scientist involved.
00:48:01,00:48:04,- There's a woman called Robin Wall Kimmerer
00:48:04,00:48:06,who I suspect some of you have come across
00:48:06,00:48:08,who seems to have written this brilliant book about moss.
00:48:08,00:48:09,"I've only read reviews of it,"
00:48:09,00:48:12,but she's sort of the moss pro.
00:48:12,00:48:15,And she looked a lot at moss traditions
00:48:15,00:48:16,in the Arctic in this area
00:48:16,00:48:17,and how people have used it.
00:48:17,00:48:19,And it's had so many purposes.
00:48:19,00:48:24,So people would make pillows out of moss.
00:48:24,00:48:25,There's a specific type of moss
00:48:25,00:48:28,that was very good for pillows called hypnum moss.
00:48:28,00:48:29,And the reason it's called that
00:48:29,00:48:30,is because it was used as a pillow
00:48:30,00:48:32,"and it was thought if you slept on it,"
00:48:32,00:48:33,it gives you special dreams.
00:48:33,00:48:36,"So it's hypnum, like, you know,"
00:48:36,00:48:37,"hypnotizing dreams. - Wow, that's cool."
00:48:37,00:48:40,"Do you think that if you got one of these moss balls,"
00:48:40,00:48:43,"then, you know, when your pillow gets too warm,"
00:48:43,00:48:44,it can turn itself over?
00:48:44,00:48:46,"- No. - Oh, lovely."
00:48:46,00:48:48,"- So slowly, though,"
00:48:48,00:48:50,"you'd have to sit up for five minutes, probably."
00:48:50,00:48:55,"They were used as nappies and sanitary towels,"
00:48:55,00:48:56,which does make sense
00:48:56,00:48:58,"'cause we've talked about hypnum moss before,"
00:48:58,00:49:01,which can absorb 40 times its body weight in water.
00:49:01,00:49:02,It's pretty good.
00:49:02,00:49:04,And you could leave that nappy on for a week.
00:49:04,00:49:05,It's the dream. - Speak to someone
00:49:05,00:49:06,who's a mother.
00:49:06,00:49:09,"You're fine, you're fine."
00:49:09,00:49:12,"I can't smell anything, you're fine."
00:49:12,00:49:15,"- I got a quiz question for you guys, very quickly."
00:49:15,00:49:16,"Okay, here's the question."
00:49:16,00:49:18,What color is Oscar the Grouch?
00:49:18,00:49:19,- Green.
00:49:19,00:49:20,"- Yeah, I'd say green."
00:49:20,00:49:22,"- Brrr, yeah."
00:49:22,00:49:24,- That's the QI klaxon going there.
00:49:24,00:49:26,Oscar the Grouch is orange.
00:49:26,00:49:27,- Is he?
00:49:27,00:49:28,- So why is he green?
00:49:28,00:49:30,"It's because he's moss. - Oh, it's living in his fur."
00:49:30,00:49:32,"- It's because he's been living in a bin so long,"
00:49:32,00:49:36,he's entirely covered in moss and mold.
00:49:36,00:49:37,- That's very good.
00:49:37,00:49:38,- His eye's so grouchy.
00:49:38,00:49:40,- Yeah.
00:49:40,00:49:41,So he's officially explained.
00:49:41,00:49:43,"He said the first year I show myself in my true colors,"
00:49:43,00:49:45,"which is orange, actually I'm still orange."
00:49:45,00:49:47,"If I ever took a bath, you'd see that."
00:49:47,00:49:50,"This is mold and moss, it makes me happy."
00:49:50,00:49:51,"- Oh, okay, yeah. - Wow, that's so funny."
00:49:51,00:49:54,- When's a good time for me to ask who Oscar the Grouch is?
00:49:54,00:49:56,"- Wow, okay. - After the show."
00:49:56,00:49:58,"- Yeah. - Okay, great, okay."
00:49:58,00:50:01,"- Sesame Street, Sesame Street, he lives in the bin."
00:50:01,00:50:02,"- I thought so, okay."
00:50:02,00:50:05,- Have you guys heard of Emmanuel the Grouchy?
00:50:05,00:50:06,"- Ooh, nice."
00:50:06,00:50:08,- He was one of Napoleon's marshals
00:50:08,00:50:09,at the Battle of Waterloo.
00:50:09,00:50:11,I only remember this 'cause we talked about Waterloo
00:50:11,00:50:13,a few weeks ago. - Yes.
00:50:13,00:50:17,- And one of the main guys there was Emmanuel the Grouchy
00:50:17,00:50:19,and Napoleon made him like the Marshal of all France
00:50:19,00:50:21,or something like that.
00:50:21,00:50:22,"- Well, there were six other marshals, weren't there?"
00:50:22,00:50:25,"There was Happy, Sleepy, Dopey."
00:50:25,00:50:30,"Okay, giant moss, most moss is tiny, obviously, isn't it?"
00:50:30,00:50:33,"It's close to the ground, it's low, it's not,"
00:50:33,00:50:34,you don't get moss trees.
00:50:34,00:50:37,"The gigantic moss, the biggest moss on the planet"
00:50:37,00:50:41,is called Dorsonia Superba and it gets up to 60 centimeters
00:50:41,00:50:43,tall and that is mega.
00:50:43,00:50:44,"For a moss, that's insane."
00:50:44,00:50:46,- That's big. - That is big.
00:50:46,00:50:49,- And it's because mosses don't have internal fluid systems
00:50:49,00:50:50,to carry water to their tissues.
00:50:50,00:50:52,"So they can dry out really easily,"
00:50:52,00:50:53,so they have to stay close to the ground.
00:50:53,00:50:55,"But Dorsonia has, it's so weird,"
00:50:55,00:50:57,it's done convergent evolution.
00:50:57,00:50:59,So you know how trees have a xylem and a flow
00:50:59,00:51:01,and they have the system of porting water
00:51:01,00:51:02,all the way up to the leaves.
00:51:02,00:51:05,But Dorsonia has evolved a completely separate
00:51:05,00:51:08,conduction system that functions in the same way.
00:51:08,00:51:11,"And so as a result, they can reach for the sky"
00:51:11,00:51:12,and they grow much bigger as a result.
00:51:12,00:51:14,But that's very unusual.
00:51:14,00:51:16,- How big are we talking?
00:51:16,00:51:17,- I said 60 centimeters.
00:51:17,00:51:18,- 60 centimeters.
00:51:18,00:51:19,- It's not six zero.
00:51:19,00:51:22,- Imagine two school rulers.
00:51:22,00:51:23,- Yeah.
00:51:23,00:51:23,- Yeah.
00:51:23,00:51:24,- One on top of the other.
00:51:24,00:51:25,- Yeah.
00:51:25,00:51:26,- That's how tall we're talking here.
00:51:26,00:51:27,- Huge.
00:51:27,00:51:30,"- Yeah, it's a similar reveal for the peanut"
00:51:30,00:51:32,"to the almond size, I would say."
00:51:32,00:51:32,(laughing)
00:51:32,00:51:33,- What?
00:51:33,00:51:37,"- This must be like, it must be 1,000 times taller"
00:51:37,00:51:38,than your average moss.
00:51:38,00:51:39,"- No, it's incredible."
00:51:39,00:51:40,- Hundreds.
00:51:40,00:51:42,"- And mosses, I don't think we've ever mentioned"
00:51:42,00:51:47,that sort of the individual leaves are what are so tiny.
00:51:47,00:51:49,They're only one cell thick.
00:51:49,00:51:51,Isn't it so odd that we're looking at stuff
00:51:51,00:51:53,that we can see and it looks thick
00:51:53,00:51:56,and it covers rocks and tarmac and roofs and whatever.
00:51:56,00:51:58,"Each leaf is one cell thick,"
00:51:58,00:52:02,"which means 100th of a millimeter, basically."
00:52:02,00:52:03,- It's small.
00:52:03,00:52:05,"- It's small, yeah."
00:52:05,00:52:08,Some of them deliberately make themselves smell like poo
00:52:08,00:52:10,or corpses.
00:52:10,00:52:12,So this is--
00:52:12,00:52:13,- Why is that?
00:52:13,00:52:15,Because like plants do it so that insects come
00:52:15,00:52:17,"and they get pollinated, right?"
00:52:17,00:52:19,But that can't be 'cause they don't have pollen.
00:52:19,00:52:20,"- No, no, same thing."
00:52:20,00:52:23,"Same thing, so they get, so dispersing their seeds."
00:52:23,00:52:25,So most of them disperse via spores.
00:52:25,00:52:26,They get taken by the wind
00:52:26,00:52:30,and they can get taken amazing distances across continents.
00:52:30,00:52:33,But there are certain moss and one of the species
00:52:33,00:52:35,"is called splachnums ferricum,"
00:52:35,00:52:38,which is also known as pink stick dung moss.
00:52:38,00:52:40,And it lives on droppings.
00:52:40,00:52:42,"And in fact, all of dung moss lives"
00:52:42,00:52:44,on very specific types of dung.
00:52:44,00:52:48,So pink stick dung moss lives only on the droppings
00:52:48,00:52:50,of white-tailed deer about a month
00:52:50,00:52:52,after they've been pooed out.
00:52:52,00:52:55,And it grows on these droppings.
00:52:55,00:52:57,And then it uses these droppings
00:52:57,00:52:59,"to make this amazing poo scent,"
00:52:59,00:53:02,"which it emits, which attracts all of these flies,"
00:53:02,00:53:03,which come to lay their eggs.
00:53:03,00:53:05,"And as they lay their eggs all over the moss,"
00:53:05,00:53:07,they pick up these clusters of spores on their legs.
00:53:07,00:53:09,And so they disseminate them.
00:53:09,00:53:11,- That's amazing.
00:53:11,00:53:12,- I think I've got a different impression
00:53:12,00:53:14,of what moss is to maybe other people
00:53:14,00:53:17,because it's so mad that there's the idea
00:53:17,00:53:20,that moss has basically sperm in an egg
00:53:20,00:53:23,and that the sperm needs to find its way to an egg.
00:53:23,00:53:25,I thought moss just happened.
00:53:25,00:53:27,I didn't think the egg-- - Did you?
00:53:27,00:53:28,"- Yeah, I did, absolutely."
00:53:28,00:53:29,"- I thought, I didn't realize it was--"
00:53:29,00:53:31,- Are you an ancient Greek naturalist?
00:53:31,00:53:32,(laughing)
00:53:32,00:53:36,- He's middle-aged's spontaneous generationalist.
00:53:36,00:53:39,"- But I agree with Dan, the idea of sperm"
00:53:39,00:53:41,and moss reproduction generally in moss sex
00:53:41,00:53:42,is so hard to get your head around.
00:53:42,00:53:44,And they sort of come in two phases of life.
00:53:44,00:53:47,But the way that the sperm find the egg
00:53:47,00:53:51,seems to be that certain male moss will produce sperm
00:53:51,00:53:53,in like a cup on top of them often
00:53:53,00:53:56,"and then get splashed by raindrops,"
00:53:56,00:54:00,it also finds a way to swim to an egg of a female moss
00:54:00,00:54:01,and sex it up.
00:54:01,00:54:03,And that makes another moss that makes spores.
00:54:03,00:54:06,"And understandably, I think they often don't do this"
00:54:06,00:54:08,very often at all 'cause it's a lot of effort.
00:54:08,00:54:11,So I read an article featuring a biologist
00:54:11,00:54:13,called Kirstin Fisher who studies the sex lives
00:54:13,00:54:16,of a moss called Syntricia caninervous.
00:54:16,00:54:19,And she said they have sex about every 30 years.
00:54:19,00:54:20,So she's been in the field all the time.
00:54:20,00:54:24,"- Well, you know, you're tired, you've been at work."
00:54:24,00:54:26,- It's so easy to just...
00:54:26,00:54:29,"- Darling, it's been 29 years and 11 months."
00:54:29,00:54:31,(all laughing)
00:54:31,00:54:33,- That's so funny.
00:54:33,00:54:34,Oh my goodness.
00:54:34,00:54:36,What an amazing thing to study.
00:54:36,00:54:38,What a hero in a way.
00:54:38,00:54:41,"Get on early, the sex life of a very particular moss"
00:54:41,00:54:43,that only has sex every 30 years.
00:54:43,00:54:46,Here's one thing.
00:54:46,00:54:48,You've been in World War II.
00:54:48,00:54:49,It's been a pretty tough time.
00:54:49,00:54:51,You've been living in Europe.
00:54:51,00:54:55,Why would it be good to be a moss enthusiast?
00:54:55,00:54:58,- So there's lots of moss suddenly growing
00:54:58,00:55:02,in areas which have been abandoned due to the war?
00:55:02,00:55:03,- That's very good.
00:55:03,00:55:05,- Lots of dead people?
00:55:05,00:55:05,Lots of dead people.
00:55:05,00:55:07,There's a kind of moss that grows on corpses?
00:55:07,00:55:08,"- Oh, there might be."
00:55:08,00:55:09,"No, this is more practical."
00:55:09,00:55:10,- Okay.
00:55:10,00:55:13,- There's a very famous moss scientist in America
00:55:13,00:55:16,who named lots of mosses called Geneva Sare.
00:55:16,00:55:18,"And at the end of the war,"
00:55:18,00:55:22,"she organized the sending of food, clothes, and money"
00:55:22,00:55:25,to distressed bryologists in Europe.
00:55:25,00:55:28,"So like if you were a moss scientist in Europe,"
00:55:28,00:55:31,you could expect a nice little package of money
00:55:31,00:55:32,and clothes to come.
00:55:32,00:55:33,- I love that.
00:55:33,00:55:34,- I see moss people stick together.
00:55:34,00:55:35,That's great.
00:55:35,00:55:37,- Why are they particularly distressed?
00:55:37,00:55:37,Were they particularly distressed?
00:55:37,00:55:40,"And bryologists are moss studyers, I think."
00:55:40,00:55:41,- Yeah.
00:55:41,00:55:43,"Well, it's not that they're particularly distressed."
00:55:43,00:55:44,"It's just that the industry is,"
00:55:44,00:55:46,she's looking out for people who share her line of work.
00:55:46,00:55:47,- That's exactly it.
00:55:47,00:55:49,- Basically the entirety of Europe
00:55:49,00:55:51,was distressed after World War II.
00:55:51,00:55:55,And the bryologists were no exception.
00:55:55,00:55:58,"And she thought, well, I'm gonna send some money over,"
00:55:58,00:56:01,"but I wanna send it to fellow moss, moss lovers."
00:56:01,00:56:02,- Someone gets in touch.
00:56:02,00:56:04,"I studied lichen and I am, I really am quite distressed."
00:56:04,00:56:05,- No.
00:56:05,00:56:06,- Absolutely not.
00:56:06,00:56:07,"No, get out."
00:56:07,00:56:08,(laughing)
00:56:08,00:56:10,(upbeat music)
00:56:10,00:56:13,"- Okay, that's it."
00:56:13,00:56:14,That is all of our facts.
00:56:14,00:56:16,Thank you so much for listening.

00:56:42,00:56:44,I'm at no such thing as James Harkin.
00:56:44,00:56:48,"- Right, so that's where not to get in contact with James."
00:56:48,00:56:49,Andy?
00:56:49,00:56:51,- I'm on Twitter @AndreHunterM.
00:56:51,00:56:52,A lot of people also say they don't get anything
00:56:52,00:56:54,"out of my stuff, but I do actually post quite frequently."
