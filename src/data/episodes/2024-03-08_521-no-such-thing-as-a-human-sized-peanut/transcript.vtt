00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:16.380
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:17.980
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.820
 a weekly podcast coming to you

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.580
 from multiple undisclosed locations across the globe.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.620
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.820
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:28.940
 and James Harkin.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.080
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.720
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.720
 and in a particular order, here we go.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.960
 Starting with fact number one, that is Anna.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.800
 - My fact this week is that in 1950,

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.820
 a ballet was performed at the Waldorf Hotel

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.140
 where the main characters were protons, electrons,

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.040
 neutrons and a Geiger counter.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.160
 - Lovely.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.160
 I have a question.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.560
 I reckon it's hard to see an electron

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.160
 even if you're on the front row,

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.440
 you're gonna struggle to see an electron doing a plie.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.320
 - Have you seen those ballet sort of little telecopies

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.160
 you sometimes get at the ballet

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.280
 where you put a coin in the slot and you can get a thing out?

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.560
 It's like that, but everyone gets a--

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.400
 - Electron microscope.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.240
 - Electron microscope.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.820
 - 15 million times magnifying, yeah.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:15.660
 - Got it.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:16.480
 - Yeah, everyone had that.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.840
 It was a very expensive place put on.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.520
 No, this sits on one of those things

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.680
 and they were human sized, played by humans.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.600
 And this was reported in Time Magazine

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.920
 and it was a story that the founder

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.200
 of the Atomic Energy Association of Great Britain

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.640
 who was a woman called Muriel Howarth

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.720
 was putting on isotopia, which was a ballet

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.560
 and the article goes on to describe or review it

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.000
 saying it was 13 bosomy women girating gracefully

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.120
 an ample electron in black lace wound her way

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.680
 around two matrons labeled proton and neutron.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.880
 I see because like an electron is like 2000 times smaller

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.060
 than a neutron.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.760
 So they didn't get like a very small person

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.320
 or a child to be the electron and--

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.920
 - It wasn't to scale, no.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.520
 - I'm not sure the casting process was as scientific

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.360
 as you would like, James, for this.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.320
 I'm just getting a vibe that you would have some notes

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.640
 if you were sitting in as director.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.240
 - I would have notes and they would say,

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.120
 James, you can be the electron 'cause you can so negative.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.320
 - It sounds amazing.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.640
 I can't tell even from the review whether it was good

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.400
 or not because the person who wrote the review.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.360
 Well, the person says the 250 wrapped ladies,

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.680
 that means it's good so far,

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.720
 and a dozen faintly bored gentlemen.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.160
 Faintly bored is a stupid thing to add in a review.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.360
 - Sorry, can I also add what you said there

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.820
 didn't quite make sense unless you know

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.960
 that the word wrapped was spelt R-A-P-T.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.880
 So it wasn't 250 women who are wrapped in,

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.840
 like, you know, but were wrapped possibly.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.920
 - They burst out of their gift wrapping

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.640
 as the grand finale.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.320
 - And sorry, Dan, when Dan said faintly bored gentlemen,

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.480
 he meant bored B-O-R-E-D,

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.520
 and not that they were made out of plywood.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.360
 - You see what I mean, it's a confusing review.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.120
 - It's hard, yeah, it's very hard.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.660
 I don't think it's been restaged many times.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:11.500
 - No.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.160
 - And she wanted it after its debut

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.640
 to play at the Albert Hall, which I don't think it did.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.440
 And she said, she's a brilliant woman, Mural Howard.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.960
 I'm sure we're gonna talk more about her now.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.720
 She said she wanted it to be at the Albert Hall,

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.120
 so they would have room for all the 92 transmutations

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.680
 of the atom, which is like the director's cut version,

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.680
 so ambitious.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.480
 And she set up loads of atomic bodies, Mural Howard.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.000
 And this might have been when she was the Institute

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.720
 for Atomic Information, or it might have been

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.240
 its previous guys, the Ladies' Atomic Energy Club,

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.200
 which just sounds like such a...

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.840
 - It sounds like a Richard Usman book.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.680
 - It does.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.160
 - It sounds like a cute novel.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.840
 - It really does, yeah.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.760
 - Did you guys know she did a follow-up to this?

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.320
 That there was a musical piece, a piano concerto

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.120
 that she did as a follow-up to Isotopia.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.960
 Yeah, it was called Atomica.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.640
 And the review of it says it chiefly consisted

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.400
 of loud, heavy chords, which indicated atomic bombs

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.360
 and springing, tinkling passages,

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.080
 which reflected the extreme surprise

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.600
 and alarm of the human race.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.440
 - It sounds like what the response would be,

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.160
 but not a great advert, 'cause the whole point of it

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.280
 was that she was trying to tell the public

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.920
 how great atomic energy was.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.920
 So she was employed by Atomic Energy to be its PR man.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.840
 And the aim of this society was to lead women

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.000
 out of the kitchen and into the atomic age.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.480
 So she particularly wanted to target women,

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.560
 which is why there were all these wrapped women.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.800
 And they're mildly bored husbands, apparently.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.160
 But she was amazing.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.760
 - Yeah, extraordinary. - A self-sort completely.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.520
 She was inspired by reading this Nobel Prize winners book,

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.440
 guy called Frederick Soddy.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.720
 And she was inspired by his statement

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.640
 that we could transform a desert continent,

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.520
 thaw the frozen poles and make the world

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.120
 one smiling garden of Eden using atomic energy,

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.480
 which weirdly we have now done and it's not that good.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.440
 But yeah, and she taught herself all about the atom

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.520
 and then tried to spread the good word.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.560
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.280
 And atomic gardening was the big thing,

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.680
 which is probably why isotopia was so much about food.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.640
 It's like early GM,

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.800
 but it's incredibly unscientific ways of doing GM.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.680
 Basically, you plant a load of crops in a circle,

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.120
 you put a radioactive source in the middle.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.080
 - When you say radioactive source, sorry,

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.480
 we're spelling that-- - Yes.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.440
 - 'Cause that's genuine possible confusion, isn't it?

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.520
 I think. - Yeah, I suppose so.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.320
 Yeah, a source of radiation.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.160
 Does that clear it up?

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.000
 Not much.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.200
 Anyway, there's some radioactive stuff

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.680
 in the middle of the pie chart

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.240
 and then all the plants near it--

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.120
 - Was this a physical pie? - Or was this like a--

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.520
 - Gee, was--

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.720
 - Sorry, go on, Andy.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.360
 - Yeah, no one else got any amusing homophones.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.280
 They wanna bust out.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.880
 - When you say homophones.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:43.720
 - Oh my God.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.400
 (all laughing)

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.440
 So you put your gamma radiation right in the middle,

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.480
 and the plants that are nearest to the seedlings

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.280
 get completely blasted and they just die.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.440
 And then the ones further out get tumors.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.200
 And the ones further out than that,

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.960
 on the outer edge of the pie chart,

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.520
 get a load of mutations.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.760
 And those mutations might be useful in some ways.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.720
 So they might make the plant stronger

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.920
 or they might make it more resistant

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.400
 to particular kinds of blight.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.240
 And you just do thousands of experiments

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.480
 and they produce thousands of new varieties of plants,

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.920
 some of which I think are still in use today.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.480
 The mutations actually worked for agriculture.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.040
 - Absolutely, like the peppermint oil,

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.000
 any peppermint oil which you have today,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.840
 which you might think,

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.680
 "Well, I don't really have much peppermint oil,"

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.880
 but actually it's in loads of foods that you get

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.760
 as like a very minor ingredient

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.000
 that was invented by atomic gardening.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.640
 It's in toothpaste and stuff like that, for instance.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.720
 But she became famous for inventing

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.360
 the world's first atomic peanut.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.200
 Didn't she?

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.880
 - Yeah, she made this radioactive peanut,

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.880
 which germinated in four days and grew two feet tall,

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.600
 which apparently is quite big for a peanut.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.200
 That's a peanut plant, not the peanuts.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.200
 - Yeah, 'cause the peanut itself,

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.400
 disappointingly, as I read in the reviews,

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.520
 was the size of an almond.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.360
 - Yes, yeah.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.200
 - Which is like--

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.840
 - That's a huge peanut.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.400
 In the peanut world, that's big.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.680
 Yeah, absolutely.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.200
 That's double or triple a normal peanut.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.160
 - It is quite good.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.000
 But you do get jumbo peanuts these days,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.080
 which I don't think are irradiated.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:10.880
 - I want a peanut the size of a person,

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.000
 but sorry, ruined it.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.600
 (laughing)

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.840
 - If you look at all the pictures

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.200
 in the newspapers at the time,

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.280
 she's there, a picture of her with her peanut,

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.880
 which looks a bit like an almond,

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.160
 'cause obviously the pictures aren't great either,

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.920
 so you can't really see what she's doing.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.360
 But that was when she first really got in the newspapers

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.200
 and became big.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.240
 And then she started trying to do all of these

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.520
 publicity stunts of which the ballet was won.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:38.680
 And one of them was she cooked a roast dinner,

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.840
 English roast dinner of beef, vegetables,

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.760
 Yorkshire pudding, potatoes, and onions.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.400
 But the potatoes and onions were three years old,

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.080
 so they'd been irradiated and they were absolutely fine

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.560
 after three years, that was her opinion.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.400
 - It's brilliant.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.240
 - It's so good.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.440
 That must have been revolutionary,

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.760
 like time travel cuisine.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.560
 - Yeah, it must have been amazing,

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.560
 but apparently it didn't taste of anything.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.400
 - Right, okay.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.840
 - 'Cause once you'd irradiated them

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.160
 and kept them for three years,

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.640
 any kind of taste in this potato or onion

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.440
 had just disappeared completely.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.840
 If you're cooking with onions,

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.480
 and they've often been in the back of your pantry

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.760
 for a bit of time,

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.440
 I mean, do you need to irradiate it

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.760
 to serve three-year-old onions?

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.520
 I reckon I've probably tried to cook myself

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.440
 an onion verging on that.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.480
 You know, and you get the soft bits off,

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:24.120
 and sometimes there's a bit that's salvageable.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.880
 I'm not sure you needed to go through all of that trouble.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:27.800
 Do you know what I mean?

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.000
 - I know exactly what you mean,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.480
 having known you for 15 years.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.880
 - And never come for dinner at my house,

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.680
 despite multiple invitations.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.200
 - Another cool thing that she did is that

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.840
 she put a message out saying,

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.840
 "I need people to help me with this."

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.200
 And if you want to get involved,

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.040
 get in contact,

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:45.440
 and if anyone did get in contact,

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.640
 she sent them seeds through the post.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:48.640
 And to encourage it,

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.480
 she launched the Muriel Howarth Peanut Prize

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.200
 to the best mutant things each year.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.720
 But we don't actually know whether or not

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:56.720
 anyone was awarded it,

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.280
 because again, it was so hard to find these mutants.

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.120
 - Really?

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:00.960
 - Yeah.

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:01.800
 - Wow.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:02.640
 - I didn't know that.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.360
 - Either that or someone created a mutant plant

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.480
 so vicious, it ate all of them.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.680
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.760
 - The evidence was destroyed.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.480
 She used to carry a potato around in her pocket.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.560
 That wasn't just any potato.

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.720
 It was an irradiated potato.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:17.560
 - Did she?

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:18.400
 (laughing)

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:19.240
 - What?

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.200
 - That was a publicity stunt.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.280
 And I-

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.680
 - It's not very good publicity if it's in your pocket,

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.240
 unless you have a transparent pocket.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.760
 - Well, she had it very obvious,

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.040
 and she used to open with a chat-up line,

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.440
 "You know, I am not just pleased to see you.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.840
 It's actually an irradiated potato in my pocket."

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:34.680
 (laughing)

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.520
 - So, good retention.

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.800
 - Have I ever said that in the old days

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.840
 of crown green bowling in Lancashire,

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.280
 this was at the turn of the 20th century,

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.520
 the bowlers would often keep a jacket potato

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:46.840
 in their pockets?

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.200
 - Like a hot water bottle?

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.040
 - Why?

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:49.880
 - Exactly, yeah.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:50.720
 - Oh, wow.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.760
 - So it would be to keep your hands warm,

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.640
 so you'd have a jacket potato in your pocket,

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.080
 and whenever your hands got cold,

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.640
 'cause it's always cold in Lancashire,

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.600
 you would put your hands in your pocket,

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.880
 warm them up, that would be good for the game,

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:02.360
 and then when there was a break in the game,

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:03.720
 you could eat the jacket potato.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.560
 - Wow.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:05.840
 - There must have been a lot of either, A,

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.640
 amusing mishaps where people accidentally threw

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.240
 the potato along the pitch,

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:14.000
 or B, a lot of arrests for suspected masturbation.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.800
 (laughing)

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.960
 No, it's, we know the potato's in your other pocket,

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:20.960
 but we know that.

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.160
 (laughing)

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.760
 Can we say on how, there is a fantastic source,

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.360
 if you do want to read more about atomic gardening,

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.920
 there's a website called atomicgardening.com.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.640
 I think it's run by someone called Paige Johnson.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:31.480
 - Yes, that's right.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:32.440
 - Who is kind of the,

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.640
 I don't know if she's the official or unofficial,

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.520
 but she is the historian on this subject.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.160
 It's so interesting.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.000
 - Definitely.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.200
 - She's just kind of found everything

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.560
 about Howarth over the years, and yeah, it's very cool.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:44.400
 - Yeah.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:45.320
 - And in fact, one thing she found

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.920
 that I couldn't find where she got it from,

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.480
 she wrote that Muriel Howarth also patented

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.360
 an early picture and sound recording device

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.880
 called the talky phone.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:54.720
 - Did she?

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:55.560
 - Oh.

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:56.400
 - Yeah, she did.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.240
 - She was extraordinary.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.080
 She was a science fiction writer as well.

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.920
 She was putting these concertos together.

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.720
 She was an all-rounder.

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.800
 And I thought the story was gonna end,

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:09.240
 and this is part of the bad branding of nuclear power,

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.440
 that, oh, she would have got really ill

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.200
 off the back of this and eventually died,

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.600
 and that's why we don't do it anymore,

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:15.720
 but that didn't happen.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:16.960
 This was safe.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.520
 This was safe for her. - I was wondering, Dan,

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:21.840
 do you think that she was so prolific

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.760
 because she'd had a bit of radiation in her body?

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:28.380
 Maybe there was a big circle of Muriel Howarth's

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.320
 with a radioactive source in the middle,

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.280
 and she was just at the right position

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.800
 where she got the right blast of radiation,

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.280
 and it made her a superhero.

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.320
 - That's so exciting.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.780
 I hadn't considered that,

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:42.600
 and that's all I'm gonna take away from this show now.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.680
 - So what's happened to all the other Muriel Howarths

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:47.320
 who are kind of weird, mutant-formed,

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.160
 gigantic, or minuscule green?

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:50.160
 - She's eaten them.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.760
 She's eaten them as something to provide flavor

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:55.000
 next to these awful potatoes and onions.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.160
 - They are the bad guys in the Muriel Howarth comic book.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.320
 - Oh, that's such a good idea.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.680
 Wait, and it's called, sorry,

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.160
 the comic book is called The Ladies' Atomic Energy Club,

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.720
 and it's about all the ladies are Muriel Howarth

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:11.880
 who've been replicated, and they've got different skills.

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.120
 One of them's got 19 legs.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.680
 - One writes piano concertos,

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.520
 the other writes science fiction novels.

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:19.200
 - Can I just say, it seems like quite often

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.760
 we come up with these brilliant ideas,

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.120
 but no one at Hollywood has gotten in touch with us yet,

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.760
 so maybe they're getting our email wrong or something,

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:29.120
 but it's podcast@qi.com if anyone wants to give us

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.200
 a million quits about that.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:31.040
 - I think that's true.

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.800
 I think maybe they assume that we've got them in development

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.200
 through our own, obviously, massive production company,

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.800
 and they just think, oh, well, those guys have thought

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.520
 of whatever stupid thing we've come up with this week.

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:44.920
 This was all kind of the pro atomic energy movement,

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:46.400
 wasn't it, saying, actually,

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.160
 this thing was invented for war.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.280
 It's very, very powerful, but it can be used for peace.

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.720
 It can provide electricity and power that's much cleaner,

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.600
 doesn't cause carbon emissions, all that,

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.120
 and I just find it interesting.

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.720
 I had no idea how big the early movement was,

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:02.120
 so I read a great interview with a,

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.520
 she's a poet, actually, called Deborah Greger,

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:06.720
 and she grew up in a place called Hanford, Washington,

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.680
 which is where the Manhattan Project was partly based.

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.440
 It was where the first plutonium reactor

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.320
 in the world was cited, right?

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:16.440
 And it was such a culture of pro atomic energy.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:19.400
 High school football team was called the Richland Bombers.

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:20.880
 The cheerleaders for the football team

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.080
 had a four foot high nuclear bomb painted

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:25.200
 in the school colors, which they would dance around

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.720
 at halftime.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.360
 And this is so cool.

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.120
 Once a month, her dad came back from work

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.840
 with a case, right, special suitcase,

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.680
 and it had two glass bottles in it,

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.960
 and his job was to fill the bottles with urine

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.400
 and leave them out on the front doorstep.

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:40.760
 - Oh, really?

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:42.880
 - And it was so he could be tested for any,

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.320
 if he'd had too much radiation exposure,

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.440
 at his job at the power plant.

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:48.840
 - So was there a postman, specifically,

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.600
 whose job was to come and collect two vials of urine?

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.000
 - I think it may be milkman, though.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.400
 Because you've got the space on,

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.360
 if you've dropped two bottles of milk off,

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:59.840
 you've got a space for two urine bottles.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.080
 - Yep, that's it.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.960
 And the milk fairy, the urine fairy, comes around.

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:05.280
 - Yeah, you don't--

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:06.720
 - You don't want to mix up those orders.

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:07.560
 - Yeah, you don't want to.

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:08.840
 - Hang on, I've submitted the full-fat milk

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.280
 to the testing facility.

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:11.320
 (laughing)

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.120
 - What's up, my colleagues?

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:15.700
 (upbeat music)

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:21.160
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two,

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.960
 and that is Andy.

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:26.200
 My fact is that, in 1340, at the beginning

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:27.520
 of the Hundred Years' War,

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:30.600
 Edward III challenged King Philip VI of France

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:33.120
 to settle who was the rifle heir to the French throne

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.920
 by exposing themselves to hungry lions.

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.000
 (laughing)

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.640
 - Now, let's go through these words.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.780
 Exposing yourself, can you define that, please?

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:42.280
 (laughing)

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.520
 - What a good point, what a good point.

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.800
 Sorry, you would basically put yourself in a room

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:49.320
 with a hungry lion, or a cage, or whatever.

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:51.080
 And the idea, obviously,

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:53.840
 a lion will never attack a true king.

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:56.880
 So this was like just a great acid test

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.240
 for who's the real king, let's find out.

00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.960
 - Has anyone told the lion this?

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.400
 (laughing)

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.440
 - Well, exactly, it's so weird.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:06.880
 - That is amazing, I wonder, at this stage,

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.680
 it's a little bit like the Cold War,

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:10.720
 where you've got two people

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.840
 who could mutually kill each other.

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:15.400
 You know, if Philip calls his bluff,

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:16.680
 then they're both dead.

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:19.840
 'Cause they both have to go and stand in front of lions,

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:20.680
 and they're both dead.

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:22.480
 - You're right, and it is lion's plural,

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.640
 so it feels like there's gonna be one lion for each of them.

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:28.080
 - Maybe they believe, I think maybe they both go in

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:30.680
 with one lion, and then the lion will have to attack

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:33.160
 one of them first, and then the other one just runs for it.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:34.840
 Right, it's me, I'm the king, I'm the king.

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:37.080
 (laughing)

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.400
 Your servants will try and sneakily rub him with meat

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:42.280
 before you go in, so that's the game as well.

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:43.440
 - Do you think they did that thing

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:47.880
 where boys used to hide their willy in their bum cracks

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:50.080
 so that the lion couldn't see it?

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:54.160
 I don't think the lion is going for the penis, per se.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.200
 - Anna, what do you think the costume choices are for this?

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.040
 Why are you...

00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.080
 (laughing)

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:02.360
 - Oh my goodness, they're exposing themselves to the lions.

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.360
 Wait, sorry.

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:05.760
 - I'm sorry, I don't think that's traditionally

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:09.000
 where you put it where you hide it in your bum crack.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:09.840
 I'm sorry.

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:11.640
 - This is when you're pretending,

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:12.800
 well, I don't know, 'cause I'm not a man,

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.200
 but when you're pretending to have a vagina,

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.760
 don't you hide it in your bum crack?

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.960
 - Between your legs, yeah, I would say more like that.

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:21.040
 - Between your legs was a normal traditional phrase.

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:21.880
 - Yeah.

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:22.720
 (laughing)

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:23.560
 - Anna.

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.600
 - You don't actually tuck it in inside your anus.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:26.920
 (laughing)

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:28.480
 - Can we please get back to the 100 years ago?

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.280
 - I'm going to imagine Philip going,

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.440
 all right, Edward, fine, we're gonna do it.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:33.360
 Fine, we're gonna do it.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.200
 Where's the lion?

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.960
 It's in that room, fine, okay.

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:38.480
 And then Edward goes, okay, pats off.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.760
 Penis in bum crack.

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:41.120
 (laughing)

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:44.120
 - Can you imagine if we had BBC live news coverage back there?

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:45.520
 Well, they're both in the room.

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:46.440
 (laughing)

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:47.560
 King Edward appears to be doing

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:50.760
 the most curious thing he's kinda tucking his,

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:52.400
 pushing his penis into his anus.

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.680
 (laughing)

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.160
 Anna, Anna.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.760
 - I don't know what I've done and I'm so sorry.

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:00.280
 - I'm sorry, this is horrible.

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.280
 Right, can we get back to the horrific conflict

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:04.520
 which killed thousands and, you know, lasted a century?

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:05.760
 - I just got a quick question.

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.120
 Did anyone find where this was an idea

00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:08.960
 that came from, the idea of those?

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:09.800
 - Yes, sorry.

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:12.600
 Well, it's just a traditional belief of King Lee,

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:14.040
 you know, you're chosen by God.

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:15.960
 So that this, I should say, this fact came in.

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:17.960
 It was based on a fact that was sent by Daniel Parrish

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:19.640
 'cause he heard us talking about scroffula

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.880
 and he has done a lot of research into that

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:23.600
 and there's an academic treatise called

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:26.880
 The Royal Touch in Early Modern England by Stephen Brogan

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.200
 and both of them did touching for scroffula.

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.040
 - Yeah.

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:32.240
 - Both Edward the Third and Philip the Sixth

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:34.120
 touched people who had scroffula

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.240
 and hopefully they'd be cured.

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:36.640
 You know, that was the idea of Monarchs

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:37.880
 had the power to do that.

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.000
 - Yeah.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.320
 - And that was another of the elements of the challenge

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.480
 was that Edward also challenged Philip the Sixth.

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.440
 He said, "Look, we can either have trial by combat,

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.520
 "we can expose ourselves to lions,

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:49.960
 "or we can have a touch off

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:51.760
 "and we'll just touch as many people

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.800
 "as we can for scroffula and whoever wins,

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:56.280
 "who cures the most people, they're the true King of France."

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:57.120
 - Yeah.

00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:58.480
 - So it's a way of avoiding this whole war.

00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:59.480
 You know, we've got a big dispute

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.320
 about who should be in charge of France.

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:02.280
 Let's find out.

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.520
 And these were the methods that were proposed.

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:06.240
 - And did Philip the Sixth turn them all down

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.280
 and say, "I'd rather just do more than 100 years more."

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.600
 - Yeah, he didn't go for it,

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.360
 which implies that he sort of knew maybe actually

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:13.920
 he shouldn't be King of France.

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:16.760
 - Yeah, or maybe they should have a King of France

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:19.720
 who doesn't think that lions are just gonna randomly

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:21.520
 not attack you because you're a king.

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:24.320
 (laughing)

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:25.480
 But yeah, 100 years war.

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.880
 England being France, more than 100 years.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:29.920
 I think that's a classic QI thing, right?

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:31.440
 - 116.

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.080
 - We're talking roughly. - 116 years.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:37.320
 But basically, England owned loads of bits of France

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.640
 and there was a big old fight

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.160
 about how much they should own

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.800
 and how much they shouldn't own.

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:43.640
 Is that right?

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.600
 - A lot of people in France thought none

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.040
 and a lot of people in England thought some.

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:50.880
 - Who actually is England and who is France here?

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:54.240
 Lots of the French dukes sided with the English crown.

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:57.200
 It's all very, it's very confusing.

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.600
 - In a lot of ways, France wasn't really

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.520
 a coalesced nation until it was over.

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:03.480
 And my theory is that the whole of the 100 years war

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.520
 was just about wine

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:10.400
 because it was triggered when Philip the Sixth confiscated

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:13.560
 Aquitaine, which is region that was owned by the English,

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:15.720
 confiscated it from Edward the Third.

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:19.440
 So it was in Gascony and Gascony was crucial to England

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:23.480
 because it contained Bordeaux and it made Claret.

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:27.920
 And England imported so much Claret.

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:30.040
 So by the 14th century, I think Bordeaux

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:33.520
 was sending Britain enough wine for every single person

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.080
 in Britain, including children,

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:37.280
 to have six bottles each a year.

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:39.280
 And suddenly Philip the Sixth said,

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:40.920
 "You can't have that region anymore."

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.480
 And the English said, "Well, what are we gonna do

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.600
 "about our wine?"

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.800
 And that's what caused it.

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:48.680
 And I think that's the most justified cause for war.

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:51.680
 - 'Cause the Gascons, they were like,

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:55.280
 "Oh, well, we're kind of happy being like friends

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:58.480
 "with the English because they're quite a long way away

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.440
 "and you have to get past the Bay of Biscay

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:02.280
 "and over the channel and they're not gonna come

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:04.880
 "and bother us and we don't really want to be friends

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:06.880
 "with these French people who are right next door

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:08.400
 "who might start taxing us more

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:10.920
 "or might start invading us and whatever."

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:12.960
 - I didn't realize, and I'm saying this more

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:15.840
 as someone who doesn't have a good grasp of English history

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.520
 and 100 years of war and stuff like that,

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.760
 but I didn't realize that in this period,

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.320
 French was basically the language of the upper class

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:26.680
 in the UK and English was the working class language.

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:30.200
 And so that's why there was, as you say Anna,

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.560
 it was sort of a bit confusing.

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:34.520
 And there was also the inheritance of the crown in France.

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:38.280
 Anyway, it wasn't there with Philip becoming king,

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:41.080
 but he wasn't a direct descendant of the king

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:43.680
 and Charles thought he had a closer connection

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:45.080
 and should be the rightful heir.

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:47.680
 So there was that as well as the wine.

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:49.400
 - Edward thought he had a rightful connection.

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:50.240
 - Sorry, that's what I meant.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.080
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:53.080
 - I think that's true, actually.

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.000
 As in, if you just go straight off

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.320
 that whoever's related the most closely,

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.840
 Edward was definitely the most closely related.

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.880
 But the French barons, they wanted Philip

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:04.280
 because he was one of them, really.

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:05.200
 That was a thing.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:08.160
 But Edward's lineage came through his mother

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:11.240
 who was Isabella the she-wolf of France.

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:12.580
 - She's incredible.

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:14.440
 - Why would you not want someone who's called

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:17.000
 Isabella the she-wolf to be the mother of the king?

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:17.840
 Well, you know.

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.760
 - Well, Isabella was the one who,

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:23.640
 she was Edward's mother,

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:26.760
 but she had overthrown his father, her husband,

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.280
 Edward II, possibly thanks to shoving

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:31.520
 a red hot poker up his arse.

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:32.840
 - That probably not really.

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:35.400
 - Probably not, but definitely due to her

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.320
 picking up a lover, Roger Mortimer,

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:39.700
 and deciding to take over England.

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:41.320
 - Was the red hot poker up the arse

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:45.360
 a, that was an aggressive thing, an enjoyable thing?

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:46.480
 - It might have been enjoyable

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.840
 at the very beginning of the situation,

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:51.620
 but certainly by the end, he wasn't enjoying it.

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:52.460
 - Right, okay.

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:53.640
 - It's like, isn't that a bit of,

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.040
 it's sort of a bit of later homophobic propaganda,

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.360
 isn't it, that thing of 'cause--

00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:58.360
 - I just think so.

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:00.760
 - 'Cause Edward II took a male lover who was,

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:01.600
 I can't remember his name now,

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.080
 but he was-- - Hey.

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:04.440
 - I've just finished David Mitchell's book,

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:06.720
 which goes into great detail about the, you know--

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:09.160
 - Dispenser, Hugh Dispenser, is he called?

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.160
 - Hugh Dispenser.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:11.000
 - I think so.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.080
 - That's a funny name.

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:13.160
 (laughing)

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:14.660
 Oh no, Piers Gavaston.

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:16.000
 - Piers Gavaston?

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.440
 He had terrible reflux, didn't he?

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:19.520
 - They were both, oh God,

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:21.480
 I think they were both rumoured,

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:22.800
 certainly rumoured to be,

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:23.720
 basically the problem was that

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.400
 Edward II was a big at choosing favourites

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:28.080
 and was very bad at distributing favours

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.800
 in a kind of equitable manner,

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.920
 so lots of people got very aggrieved about that,

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.480
 and clearly then Isabella enters the scene.

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:36.040
 - And the other thing about putting a red hot poker

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:39.880
 of the bum is that it doesn't leave any obvious scars

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.440
 unless you take a good old look at the bum.

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:45.280
 So you can kill someone, theoretically,

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:48.040
 and they might think that they died of something,

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:49.000
 an illness.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.240
 - Nah, until you look at the look on their face,

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.600
 in death.

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:53.440
 (laughing)

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.600
 - I'm surprised that you're a poker truther on this, James.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:56.440
 - What?

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.360
 - I think it's not, I think it didn't happen.

00:22:58.360 --> 00:22:59.760
 I think, I mean, Khaliba's bumped off.

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:00.960
 - Oh, sorry, I'm not saying it happened,

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:03.600
 I'm just saying that that is part of the propaganda

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:05.680
 is that they say this is why.

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:08.320
 - There seems to be a through line of arses

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:09.680
 in the Hundred Years War,

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.040
 because there was that,

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:12.920
 which fair enough is in the lead up to it,

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:14.760
 there was obviously the original fact,

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.760
 and then there was the fact that in 1346,

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:17.600
 so very early on,

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:20.360
 on the way to the Battle of Klesi,

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:22.160
 which was one of the sort of biggest,

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:25.000
 most important battles of the Hundred Years War,

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.240
 the Norman soldiers exposed their backsides

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:30.560
 to Edward III's archers,

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:32.240
 and according to reports,

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:34.280
 this pissed off the English so much

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:36.880
 that they basically launched an ill-advised attack.

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:38.400
 - They decided to win the battle instead of...

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.280
 (laughing)

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:41.760
 - No, they launched an ill-advised attack,

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:42.720
 which they lost,

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:44.880
 because they were so offended by the bear arses.

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:45.720
 - That's interesting.

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:47.120
 - Sorry, Anna, can I just quickly check?

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:48.840
 When you say there's a lot of arses,

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:49.960
 and you say the original fact,

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:51.960
 are you including your new theory

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:54.520
 that they were shoving their penises up their anus?

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:56.520
 - No, this is too much, no.

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:58.000
 - She said the original fact.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.760
 - I know, it's nothing to do with the original fact.

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:00.600
 This is Anna's first little...

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:01.440
 - It's not, sorry, sorry.

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:02.880
 It's my reading of the original fact

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:04.080
 where they exposed themselves

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:06.440
 in a flashing kind of way, yes.

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:08.040
 - One person in the Battle of Klesi

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:10.400
 was blind King John of Bohemia.

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:11.800
 He was there to support...

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.520
 - So he wouldn't have been affected by the mooning,

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:16.800
 to be fair, he was the one person who was immune to it.

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:19.720
 - He was actually on the side of the mooners.

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:21.200
 He was on Philip's side,

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:23.680
 but he'd had a bout of ophthalmia,

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:26.480
 which meant that at the time he couldn't really see anything.

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:30.640
 So he asked two of his knights to be on either side of him,

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.080
 while he was sort of strapped to his horse,

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:35.600
 and the two knights went towards the battle

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.120
 while he was in between them,

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:38.880
 so that he knew exactly that he was going

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.040
 in the right direction.

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:42.720
 - Good Lord, that is very brave.

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:44.720
 King John, you are allowed to sit this one out, it's fine.

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.480
 No one will think any less of you

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:47.960
 if you don't fight today.

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:48.920
 - No, no, I'm here now.

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.000
 - No, Grace, no.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.840
 - Well, obviously the English won it.

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:54.560
 - Oh, did the English win the Battle of Cressy?

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:55.400
 - Yeah, they did.

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:59.040
 - James, of course the English won the battle, I'm sorry.

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:01.760
 - Auntie, your outrage there is embarrassing.

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:03.000
 You're Scottish anyway, Auntie,

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.320
 you should be on the French side.

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:05.560
 - England only won about three battles

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:06.400
 in the Hundred Years' War,

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.240
 and they were definitely tilted towards the start.

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:12.280
 It was as in court, Cressy, sluice, sluice.

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:13.120
 - Yeah.

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:15.320
 - Where the French fleet was sunk.

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.360
 No, if Britain had just,

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.720
 England had just kind of sued for peace

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:19.840
 after the first 30 years,

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:22.680
 they'd had a completely cracking first 30 years to the war,

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:23.520
 and then after the,

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:24.880
 it was kind of gradually all downhill

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.960
 for the next sort of 70, 80 years.

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:28.520
 It didn't go well for them after that.

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:29.360
 It is classic.

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:32.120
 - Oh yeah, but Agincourt was a pretty good ending.

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:33.600
 - That was right towards the end.

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.200
 It was like a late goal.

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.400
 - And I think the French would object to you

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:38.960
 calling Agincourt an ending,

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.920
 given that when it did end, it was very much.

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:44.960
 - It was 30 years after the Battle of Agincourt,

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.000
 and the French won the whole war over.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.600
 - The Battle of Sluice was interesting

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:50.920
 because this was a naval battle,

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:52.840
 and the English fleet came up,

00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:53.960
 and there was,

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:56.120
 they were kind of maneuvering to get to the best angle

00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:57.680
 because of the wind and stuff like that.

00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:58.920
 And when they were maneuvering,

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:01.600
 the French got entangled with each other,

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.000
 all the different boats,

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.280
 'cause they were ready,

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:07.160
 but then because it didn't start straight away,

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:09.280
 they kind of all sort of bumped into each other

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:10.800
 and all got really entangled.

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:13.240
 - The French actually chained their boats together.

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:17.120
 Sometimes there seemed to be a tactic that worked,

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:19.080
 but it certainly wasn't in this instance,

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.600
 because, as you say, it meant they got entangled,

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:24.240
 so basically a ship couldn't go to the aid of another ship

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:25.880
 'cause they were literally attached together.

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:27.240
 It was like doing a three-legged race,

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:30.200
 but with 100 people all attached to each other in the race.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:32.560
 - It's a bit like playing foosball.

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:33.840
 It's like, it's fine.

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:36.320
 As long as the ball is right next to one of your players,

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:37.520
 you can spin around and kick it,

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:38.960
 but as soon as the ball goes anywhere,

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:40.520
 not near your players, you're fucked.

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:41.480
 - And that's why football teams

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:43.560
 tend to not chain themselves together, isn't that right?

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:46.720
 I don't watch a lot, but that is, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.240
 I like this theory, okay, there's a theory

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:49.640
 that actually the Hundred Years War

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:52.760
 really lasted from 1066 until 1904.

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:55.600
 Just a millennium of Anglo-French conflict

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:57.560
 happened basically, kicking off, obviously,

00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:58.400
 with the Battle of Hastings,

00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:01.280
 and then the 1904 was when the Entente-Cordial agreements

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:03.280
 were signed between England and France,

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:05.520
 which really bonded them very closely together.

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:07.320
 - Yeah. - There was so much conflict, you know.

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:11.320
 - Do you think, Andy, like, obviously we are allies now,

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:13.360
 but there were peace treaties signed

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:15.160
 all over those thousand years,

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:17.840
 and there's no reason to think that in 500 years

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:20.880
 there won't be another battle between England and France.

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:23.040
 So in that case, with the Hundred Years War,

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:23.880
 go on for the rest of the day.

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:25.080
 - You think this might be a long lull?

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:26.640
 - That's what I was thinking, yeah.

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:30.480
 - I hope, oh gosh, I do hope not, 'cause I love France.

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.320
 - Yeah, me too.

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:32.400
 - But look, it's possible.

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:35.240
 - I actually like it a little bit too much,

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:37.200
 and I'm thinking that, you know,

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:40.040
 that area around Bordeaux is very nice.

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:41.120
 - Do you think maybe, James,

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:44.000
 you might actually have a claim to Gascony?

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.040
 - I do drink a lot of wine.

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:48.800
 - You might, you know.

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:49.760
 - Just give it a try.

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.880
 A little foray, never hurt anyone.

00:27:51.880 --> 00:28:00.120
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:01.320
 and that is my fact.

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:03.840
 My fact this week is that Buzz Aldrin's dad

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:06.320
 once got so angry that his son wasn't featured

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:09.360
 on a US post stamp commemorating the moon landing

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.240
 that he went and stood outside the White House

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:15.200
 holding a placard that read, "My son was first too."

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:19.440
 So it's the ultimate embarrassing dad move.

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:20.760
 - It is demented.

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:23.040
 This is such a weird thing to do.

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:24.000
 - Why?

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.240
 I just think, take the win.

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.800
 That your son has been the second man

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:31.400
 to walk on the moon, just, he's not on the stamp.

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:32.240
 - Who cares?

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:33.920
 - It's odd, but I actually think so.

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:36.840
 Buzz Aldrin's dad, Edwin Aldrin Sr.,

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.360
 the buzzer's real name is Edwin, he's a junior.

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:40.920
 I have a bit of sympathy for him

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:43.800
 because I think basically he is

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:45.920
 one of the most extraordinary characters

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:49.360
 that we've had in relation to airplanes and rockets

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:50.200
 and so on.

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:53.600
 This is a guy who was literally buddies with Orville Wright,

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:54.800
 knew the Wright brother.

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:57.800
 He marries a woman who is with us.

00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:58.640
 - The Wright brother.

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:00.320
 You can't say the Wright brother.

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:03.240
 It's either the Wright brothers or A Wright brother.

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:04.520
 - He is A Wright brother.

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:06.080
 - The other one's the wrong brother.

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:11.560
 - So he's buddies with Orville Wright of the Wright brothers.

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:13.680
 He happens to be flying with a guy

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:14.840
 who's surname is Moon.

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:17.880
 He marries a woman who is called Marion Moon.

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:19.680
 His son then goes on to stand on the moon,

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:22.400
 but really he's also kind of the reason

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:23.360
 that we got to the moon.

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.280
 It's because he was very good friends

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:29.520
 with a rocket engineer called Goddard, right?

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:31.920
 Goddard is the one who basically got us to the moon.

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:34.400
 He's the one who was so key to inventing

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:36.440
 the rocket power that we needed to get there

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:37.920
 and he didn't have funding.

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:39.160
 And that was a huge problem.

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:41.720
 So Edwin Aldrin Sr., he knows him

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:43.200
 because he studied under Goddard

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:45.760
 and he's also an influential guy in that world.

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:48.280
 He sets up a meeting with Lindbergh,

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:49.680
 first to fly the Atlantic,

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:51.240
 in which he basically says,

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:53.080
 are you able to get Goddard the funding

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:55.000
 that he needs in order to go on?

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.080
 He goes to the Guggenheim Foundation

00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:58.320
 and manages to get the money.

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:02.560
 So Edwin Aldrin Sr. literally made the funding happen

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:03.920
 in order for us to get to the moon.

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:05.200
 So I can see why he's pissed off

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:08.120
 'cause he's literally the linchpin to all these elements.

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:09.120
 - I know what you mean, Dan,

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:11.440
 but you've introduced him in this section

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:14.360
 as the guy who stood with a placard

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:15.920
 as an embarrassing dad.

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:17.760
 - It's definitely an embarrassing dad move,

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:20.200
 no matter what, but I can see his reasoning.

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:21.680
 - No, come up with something better,

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:23.480
 like my son was there too,

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:25.240
 or my son also went to the moon.

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:28.480
 He said my son was first too.

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:30.920
 It's the only thing that's not true.

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:34.760
 - Can I just say, this is in 1969, right?

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:36.120
 The stamp is issued.

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:39.000
 Aldrin himself clearly was a bit

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.680
 narked about it because he had to go

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:42.880
 to the unveiling of the stamp.

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:44.160
 Aldrin wrote in his memoir,

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:47.000
 "I smiled rather weakly when I first saw the stamp,

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.920
 "though it was a bittersweet honor."

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:49.800
 I mean, come on.

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:52.320
 Michael Collins' thoughts about this are not registered.

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:54.720
 Michael Collins is nowhere even near this stamp.

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.440
 Didn't kick up half the fuss.

00:30:56.440 --> 00:31:00.840
 Also, it's not Neil Armstrong on the stamp, right?

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:05.680
 You are not allowed to commemorate the living on stamps.

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:09.960
 So logically, it can't be Neil Armstrong on this stamp.

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:13.320
 - So is it not like a famous image of him?

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:14.640
 - I think it's a drawing of a photo.

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:15.480
 - It's a drawing of the photo.

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:16.320
 - A drawing.

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.080
 - At some point between the photo and the drawing,

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:20.440
 Neil Armstrong has been replaced by a generic man.

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:23.000
 And this got controversial when they released

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.120
 an anniversary stamp some years later,

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:27.440
 'cause many thought that it portrayed Armstrong and Aldrin,

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:28.720
 who were alive at the time,

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:31.520
 and that has two astronauts on it facing the camera.

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:33.280
 But they've got the helmets up with the visor

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:34.400
 so you can't see.

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:37.040
 - And the US Postal Service never admitted to breaking the law

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:38.880
 forbidding the portrayal of living people.

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:41.600
 They just said these are generic astronauts

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:44.240
 to commemorate these two people who were real,

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:45.160
 who landed on the moon.

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:46.800
 It's such a fudge.

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:47.760
 - It's definitely a fudge

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:51.320
 when you've literally drawn a picture of a specific person.

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:55.240
 Yeah, I would say that Edwin's at least justified in that.

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:58.160
 - I read an article that was in the newspaper archives

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:01.480
 that came out the weekend after they landed on the moon,

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:04.720
 where they spoke to all the families and stuff like that.

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:08.720
 And we've said before that Buzz had communion on the moon.

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.160
 But I didn't know this.

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:13.320
 At the same time as he was taking communion on the moon,

00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:15.880
 in his church back home,

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:17.560
 they were taking the same communion

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:18.760
 with the same bit of bread.

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:19.600
 - No.

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:22.000
 - So the priest had gotten this big bit of bread

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.320
 and broken a bit off and given one piece of it to Buzz.

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:28.120
 And at the exact same time-ish,

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:29.680
 they did their own communion.

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:32.040
 And the priest said, "This loaf is not complete.

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:33.680
 "Now we shall commune with him.

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:35.040
 "He is one of us."

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:36.640
 And they're referring to Buzz.

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:38.600
 And they had to get extra seats in the church

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:41.520
 because so many people wanted to come to this communion.

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:44.600
 And they all had Bibles donated by Buzz

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:46.160
 that were inscribed with his mother's name

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:47.840
 'cause actually Buzz's mother died

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:49.160
 before he got to the moon.

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:50.720
 - It was the year before, wasn't it?

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:52.600
 - Yeah, it was May 1968.

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:54.440
 And she took her own life.

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:57.360
 And according to Buzz, the reason that she did that

00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:01.520
 is because she couldn't handle the stress of the fame

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:03.240
 and notoriety that he was gaining

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:05.600
 from being an astronaut that was going to the moon.

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:07.360
 He says it was mixed with other stuff,

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:08.600
 but that was a big factor.

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:11.320
 What a weird thing to take with you

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:12.960
 as you're about to go off to the moon,

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:15.080
 that you lost your mom for the reason of the mission.

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:18.560
 - Yeah, Marian Gladys Moon was her name.

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:20.080
 And it was 'cause he'd done the Gemini mission.

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:21.320
 So he was actually super famous

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:24.040
 before he went to the moon off the back of that.

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:26.640
 And sweetly, Buzz Aldrin did,

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:28.480
 I realized kind of looking into him,

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:29.840
 he's always mentioning the fact

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:31.840
 that his mother's maiden name was Moon.

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:34.720
 I suppose you would, because it's an incredible fact,

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:37.520
 but he does in any autobiography or interview,

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:40.520
 or anything like that, he will say, or he'll tweet it

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:43.000
 and say, yep, mother's maiden name was Moon.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:43.840
 Who would have thought?

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:46.640
 - Yeah, and he was in this newspaper article that I read,

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:50.120
 he was called the World Spacewalking Champion, they said.

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:52.360
 And the other person on the moon is Buzz Aldrin,

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:54.080
 the World Spacewalking Champion.

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:55.320
 (laughing)

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:56.320
 - Not the first though, was he?

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:58.280
 - He wasn't the first on the moon.

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:01.000
 - He'd spent five hours outside Gemini 12,

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.120
 which meant that he'd been out in space on his own

00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:05.720
 for longer than any other person.

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:07.480
 I think Leonov was the first, wasn't he?

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:09.520
 - Just back to the moon and families for a second,

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:12.200
 there was a lot of stuff that was left on the moon,

00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:15.640
 which was related to the family members of the astronauts.

00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:19.360
 Some initials were sort of put into the moon dust

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:22.200
 that will be sitting there for many, many, many, many years

00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:24.200
 unless they're disturbed by future missions

00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:26.120
 or meteorite hits or whatever.

00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:28.480
 There was a photo that was left of one of the families.

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:30.280
 So all these little beautiful little mementos.

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:32.320
 And there's actually, and I hadn't heard of this before,

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:35.280
 but there is a mystery about Neil Armstrong and the moon.

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.800
 And that is a missing 10 minutes

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:41.440
 where Neil went off-coms and stood by a crater

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:43.600
 just for 10 minutes on his own.

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:46.160
 And there's a lot of, there's a lot of conjecture

00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:48.800
 about what he did in that 10 minutes.

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:51.640
 - I reckon he put his penis into his bubble.

00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:52.480
 (laughing)

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:54.920
 Stop, I've walked around and said,

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:56.880
 "I'm the first woman on the moon."

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:59.120
 (laughing)

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:02.800
 - I think he just felt the hot jacket potato

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:05.640
 he brought with him in his space suit

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:08.040
 and warmed his hands up on that cold landscape.

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:10.920
 - I think he stared into outer space

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:13.640
 and surveyed the enormity of what he was achieving

00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:15.680
 and representing, okay?

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:17.400
 And stuck his penis in his bum crack.

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:18.360
 (laughing)

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:19.200
 - Oh my God.

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:23.080
 - Yeah, no, so there's a,

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:25.400
 it's to do with family is one of the biggest theories,

00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:28.640
 which is the fact that he very tragically lost a daughter

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:30.640
 who was two years old at the time.

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:34.800
 And there was a bracelet that he had with her name on it.

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:37.280
 And the thought is, is that he left that on the moon.

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:39.040
 He chucked that into the crater.

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:42.360
 And James Hansen, who is the official biographer

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:45.400
 of Neil Armstrong, desperately tried to prove this.

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:47.880
 And he could never get it out of Neil,

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:49.160
 whether or not it happened.

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:51.160
 His family sort of said, "I hope it happened,"

00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:52.840
 but they weren't quite sure themselves.

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:56.160
 And so it's remained an unanswered question.

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.720
 - When the moon landing happened,

00:35:57.720 --> 00:36:02.080
 there was a protest in America at the same time,

00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:04.320
 not by Buzz Aldrin's father,

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:08.720
 but by 25 families, African-American families

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:11.520
 who walked to Kennedy Space Center

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:13.920
 because they said it was a distorted sense

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:17.840
 of national priorities that America was going to the moon.

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:19.080
 Because at the time,

00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:22.560
 the poverty rate for African-Americans was 31%.

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:27.160
 And for black people living on farms, it was 62%.

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:30.080
 And so they said, "Well, why are you spending all this money

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:32.880
 on the space race when you have people living in poverty

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:34.440
 in your own country?"

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:37.280
 And the Victoria Maris,

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:40.000
 who was the head of the poverty program in Michigan,

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.720
 she said that the Apollo project was akin to a man

00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:45.160
 who has a large family.

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:47.520
 They have no shoes, no clothing, no food,

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:49.760
 and the rent is overdue, but when he gets paid,

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:53.720
 he runs out and buys himself another set of electric trains.

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:58.720
 - Oh, slam on people who just enjoy some nice train.

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:01.240
 (laughing)

00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:05.000
 I got to say, I sympathize with that guy getting his trains.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.360
 - But you've got to stop keeping your wife

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:08.840
 in poverty, Andy, there's no reason.

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:09.680
 (laughing)

00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:11.240
 - And the New York Amsterdam News,

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:13.680
 which was one of the leading black newspapers at the time,

00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:17.440
 had the headline, "Yesterday, the moon, tomorrow, maybe us."

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:20.240
 So it wasn't, and actually the space program--

00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:21.680
 - Oh, what, they'll be spending money on us?

00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:23.120
 - Yeah, precisely.

00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:25.960
 And actually until 1969,

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:29.680
 pretty much the space program wasn't universally liked.

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:32.920
 In fact, possibly not even 50% liked in America,

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:34.040
 'cause a lot of people were like,

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:35.560
 "Well, why are we wasting money on this

00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:37.160
 when there's problems at home?"

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:38.960
 And it was really only when everyone,

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:40.160
 when they walked on the moon,

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:43.360
 that the kind of opinion changed in America.

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:44.960
 - Yeah, there's a really nice description.

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:46.320
 One of the best books ever,

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:48.800
 I think about the Apollo missions is a book called "Moon Dust",

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:50.640
 if anyone is interested in this subject,

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:51.920
 listening by Andrew Smith,

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:53.600
 and he talks about all these protests,

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:55.560
 and sort of the reaction,

00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:58.200
 literally as the rocket was going into space,

00:37:58.200 --> 00:37:59.280
 the mood changed,

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:03.160
 everyone suddenly was on board in support of it,

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:06.200
 not everyone, but large groups that were protesting,

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:07.640
 suddenly just couldn't help,

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:10.840
 but see the majesty of what we were doing as humanity.

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:13.000
 So yeah, it's pretty amazing.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.040
 - So we know on the side of your falling on Dan,

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:16.920
 you think send money to the moon missions

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:19.280
 rather than people in poverty, okay.

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:21.600
 - I think send poor people to the moon.

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:25.600
 That's how we just put them off Earth and we'll be fine.

00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:28.000
 - Interesting, oh, I see.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.480
 I was gonna say, interestingly,

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:33.440
 that was kind of how the Soviets chose their cosmonauts

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:35.200
 is that they tried to find people

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:37.600
 who were born into poor backgrounds.

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:38.520
 'Cause obviously it was very,

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:40.360
 yeah, it was very good with their narrative,

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:42.640
 which was, you know, we're all together,

00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:44.520
 and if you grew up on a communal farm,

00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:48.080
 then you're just as good as anyone else in the country.

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:50.000
 - I thought you were gonna say, obviously it was very easy,

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.560
 which it would have been in the Soviet Union

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:53.920
 at that time to find people with poor backgrounds, but.

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:55.560
 - Certainly was, true.

00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:56.840
 Gagarin was born,

00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:58.560
 Yuri Gagarin, who was the first man in space,

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:01.400
 was born in a town called Gagarin.

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:02.800
 - Oh.

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:05.080
 - But it was named after him after his death.

00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:07.640
 (both laughing)

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:10.800
 But yeah, he was brought up on a collective farm,

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:14.240
 and his mother had been a factory worker in World War II,

00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:16.520
 and this was like a perfect sort of background

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:18.400
 for a cosmonaut.

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:20.360
 Toreshkova, Valentina Toreshkova,

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:23.080
 who was the first woman in space,

00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:26.320
 she was born in a town which has a population of nine.

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:27.160
 - Wow. - Wow.

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:28.360
 - Do we call it a town? - Wow.

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:30.680
 - Yeah, it's officially a town.

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:31.920
 - Wow. - But she was working

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:33.560
 in a textile mill. - Really?

00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:35.800
 - And eventually did some correspondence courses,

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:37.880
 and then became a cosmonaut.

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:40.200
 So they really wanted to get people

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:42.160
 from other backgrounds into space.

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:43.400
 - I'm really interested that you said that,

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:44.400
 'cause it certainly is interesting.

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:46.440
 Researching cosmonauts and astronauts

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:50.200
 is striking how all the astronauts from America

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:52.880
 at the time had quite similar upbringings,

00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:54.040
 very successful parents,

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:55.640
 often in the aeronautical industry.

00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:59.360
 All Soviet cosmonauts were quite gritty upbringings.

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:00.920
 I mean, Gagarin and his family

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:04.560
 lived in a three meter square mud hut during the war

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:07.360
 because their property was taken over by Nazis.

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:10.360
 On the one hand, Gagarin rebelled against the Nazis

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:11.440
 who were occupying his land,

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:15.360
 and he used to pour soil in the Nazi soldiers' tank batteries

00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:19.400
 and kind of mix up their chemicals to foil their plans.

00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:23.280
 And then I was reading that later on,

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:25.800
 when he was famous, a famous cosmonaut,

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:27.920
 he got a scar on his forehead,

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:29.920
 which you can see in later pictures.

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:33.760
 And it's from 1961 when he was on holiday

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:36.000
 with his wife and a bunch of other people,

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.680
 and they were playing cards.

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:39.760
 And he said, I'm going to bed,

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:42.000
 his wife said, I'm just going to finish this hand.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.680
 You know, I'll be there in a sec.

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:46.760
 He used this spare time to go into the hotel room

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:48.960
 of one of the other women who was a nurse

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:52.760
 who was staying in the hotel, tried to check her,

00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:54.680
 and then his wife walked down the corridor

00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:56.600
 having finished her hand a couple of minutes later,

00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:58.520
 saying, where are you, Yuri?

00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:00.600
 And so he legged it off the balcony

00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:02.200
 of this nurse's room to escape,

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:04.160
 split his head open on the tarmac.

00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:09.120
 And that's the glorious story of the first Russian

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:11.000
 in space's scar.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.120
 - Amazing. - How do I get this?

00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:13.600
 Fighting Nazis, actually.

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:16.480
 (laughing)

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:19.920
 Would you like to talk to an alien,

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:21.920
 assuming that the alien can speak your language

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:23.920
 and your safety is guaranteed?

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:24.760
 - Yes. - Would you like to

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:25.600
 meet an alien? - Yeah, I would.

00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:27.000
 - Okay, don't do that, yeah.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.320
 - Is this an offer, Andy?

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:30.560
 - It's not an offer, it's a survey from YouGov.

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:31.800
 This was done last year.

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:34.640
 21% of people said, no, I would not, thank you very much.

00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:37.840
 Even if we can speak the same language and I'm safe.

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:41.400
 14% don't know, I don't know.

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:43.960
 - I more can't understand the nose.

00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:45.880
 That is absolutely, are they too busy?

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:47.440
 Did we get the reasons?

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:48.800
 - Maybe if you're religious,

00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:51.600
 you don't want the answers that are gonna ruin things for you.

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:52.440
 Maybe.

00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:55.560
 - Well, there was that, I won't say who it was, Dan,

00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:58.480
 but a very famous person who we offered

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:01.300
 to come on the Museum of Curiosity when--

00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:02.140
 - When Buzz was on.

00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:05.200
 - When Buzz Aldrin came on and Dan emailed them

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:06.400
 and said, would you like, come on,

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:09.120
 you can meet the second person who walks on the moon

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:10.320
 and that person wrote back saying,

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:11.680
 no, I don't really like space.

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:13.480
 - Yeah, not really into space.

00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:16.680
 - Can you bleep out and say who it was now?

00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:17.840
 (beep)

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:18.680
 - Get out.

00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:19.520
 - Yeah.

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:21.400
 - You're going back going, I'm such a nice space,

00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:25.180
 not really my thing, but thanks for the offer.

00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:27.880
 - I'm staggered, I'm staggered.

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:29.080
 - Yeah, it was incredible.

00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:30.280
 - That's shocking.

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:34.640
 - So that person, I reckon probably would be one of the 20%.

00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:35.860
 - Yeah.

00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:36.700
 - I agree.

00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:39.000
 - Dairy-like aliens, not my thing, I'm interested.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.360
 - Yeah, no, thank you.

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:42.940
 (upbeat music)

00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:48.360
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:50.440
 and that is James.

00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:53.680
 - Okay, my fact this week is if you go to the Arctic

00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:57.600
 at the right time, you can view huge herds of moss balls

00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:00.160
 migrating across the plains.

00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:01.280
 - Magnificent.

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:05.480
 - Now, if you do go there to see the migrating moss balls,

00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:09.460
 we should say migrating at a speed that you would expect.

00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:12.300
 It's probably a bit of a misleading idea.

00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:15.140
 These are, if your trip is for seven years,

00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:18.980
 you might see it move a good foot or baby.

00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:21.020
 - If you're really eagle-eyed,

00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:22.980
 they move about an inch a day.

00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:23.820
 - Yeah.

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:27.020
 - It's not the quickest migration ever, but you know,

00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:28.580
 it's not bad for a moss.

00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:30.060
 - It is astonishing as well.

00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:32.500
 It is astonishing when you see photos of these things

00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:34.260
 and the fact that they herd together

00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:37.360
 and they turn left together and they move forward together.

00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:38.640
 It's insane.

00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:41.360
 - So this is research by a couple of researchers,

00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:44.900
 one of whom I was reading about called Tim Bartholomus

00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:49.260
 and he described them as bright green in a world of white.

00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:51.760
 In the 1950s, when they were first described,

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:54.700
 there was a nice landed guy who called them Glacier mice.

00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:57.060
 So that gives you kind of an idea of what they look like,

00:43:57.060 --> 00:43:58.660
 but they're bright green.

00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:02.380
 And if you look at them, they seem like they're not moving,

00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:04.620
 but actually they're very, very slowly moving

00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:07.100
 and they all move in the same direction.

00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:08.980
 And they don't all move with the wind.

00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:12.700
 They don't all move because sunlight is melting bits of ice

00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:13.820
 and it's moving them.

00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:15.060
 They don't move.

00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:16.740
 There's various different theories.

00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:17.580
 - Angle of slopes.

00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:18.820
 - Yeah, they don't go downhill.

00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:20.260
 We don't know why they do it

00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:21.420
 and we don't know how they do it.

00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:23.020
 And every time we come up with a theory,

00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:24.460
 someone disproves it.

00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:25.280
 - Aliens?

00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:27.020
 Has anyone talked about the aliens?

00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:29.300
 - No, actually these are part of the 20%

00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:30.780
 that don't really like aliens.

00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:32.700
 (laughing)

00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:34.900
 - And the other brilliant thing is this scientist,

00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:36.580
 one of the ones, Tim Bartholomew,

00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:38.340
 I think he's Tim Bartholomew mouse

00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:39.940
 and these are Glacier mice.

00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:41.620
 - No, that's true.

00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:42.460
 - Yes.

00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:43.300
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:44.940
 - It is actually quite confusing when you read about them

00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:46.620
 'cause they're very commonly referred to

00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:49.020
 in the few things that have been written about them as mice.

00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:51.220
 And so you keep having to remind yourself halfway through

00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:53.620
 whatever the New York Times article when it says,

00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:55.940
 "And within the mice, it's extremely warm

00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:57.220
 "and lots of insects live.

00:44:57.220 --> 00:44:58.220
 "They're not actually mice.

00:44:58.220 --> 00:44:59.060
 "They're not actually mice."

00:44:59.060 --> 00:44:59.900
 - It was the plural of moss.

00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:00.740
 - The plural of moss is mice.

00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:01.560
 That's the other thing.

00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:02.400
 (laughing)

00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:03.240
 - Of course.

00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:04.080
 - Yeah.

00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:04.960
 The guy who discovered these in the '50s,

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:07.980
 John Aetherson, he pointed out that

00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:11.740
 rolling stones can gather moss.

00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:12.740
 'Cause in the middle of all,

00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:13.940
 at the heart of all of these mice,

00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:15.500
 there might be a tiny bit of gravel

00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:17.500
 or a bit of something that it's formed around

00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:18.780
 and the moss has grown around.

00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:19.820
 And it's more like you get moss

00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:21.180
 that gathers and rolls over stones.

00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:23.060
 Actually, really.

00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:24.420
 But either way, it's gorgeous.

00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:26.620
 They're kind of like little mossy tumbleweed in a way.

00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:27.460
 - Yeah.

00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:30.780
 - I love the idea, the imagery of the pedestals

00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:31.620
 that they sit on.

00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:33.340
 If you catch them at the right time,

00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:34.980
 let's say you come across a herd,

00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:37.900
 they might all be perched up as if they're on plinths.

00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:41.140
 Because they're covering a very specific bit of the ice

00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:42.580
 with the mossy ball itself,

00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:44.980
 the ice will remain because they're insulating it

00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:46.300
 or rather keeping it cold.

00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:48.940
 So you end up seeing what looks genuinely,

00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:50.580
 I think, Anna, to your point,

00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:52.060
 like you'd be like, "Is this aliens?

00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:52.900
 "What is going on here?

00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:54.780
 "Has some weird artist come out here

00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:56.360
 "and just carved around these balls

00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:58.260
 "and left them for just to find?"

00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:02.260
 And one of the thoughts is that then it rolls down the hill

00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:04.300
 for what it's created off this pedestal

00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:05.980
 and they all roll at the same time.

00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:08.060
 - So that was one of the theories.

00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:10.740
 But again, this quite recent study

00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:13.380
 where they put trackers inside the mice

00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:16.140
 kind of disproved this theory of the pedestals.

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:18.340
 Not that they exist 'cause they definitely do,

00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:19.900
 but there's something else happening

00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:22.940
 because it's not like they're staying in one place

00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:24.580
 and then moving.

00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:28.480
 They're kind of every day on average moving about an inch.

00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:31.440
 - And I love as well that this guy, Bartholomeus,

00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:34.160
 he's, the way they tracked it is they just put little bits

00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:36.440
 of like small wire around the moss balls

00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:39.280
 in different colors so they could see which one was which.

00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:42.400
 And he's been going back occasionally to see them,

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:43.880
 but now he doesn't know where they are.

00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:45.880
 He's lost his moss balls.

00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:49.200
 And that's extraordinary that whole herd

00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:50.480
 has gone missing on him.

00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:52.240
 - If that moss ball can outrun you,

00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:55.980
 then you need to be taking more exercise, Bartholomeus.

00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:58.540
 - Can I read you a bit of romantic,

00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:01.100
 just a brief romantic passage about these things?

00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:02.780
 - Did you write it?

00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:05.260
 - No, thankfully, don't worry, I didn't.

00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:06.100
 - Okay, then yeah.

00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:07.340
 - This is about the other scientists

00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:09.140
 in this recent paper who studied these things.

00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:10.660
 Sophie Gilbert, she's a biologist.

00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:13.580
 And the University of Alaska website says,

00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:17.220
 they met in 2006 studying at the Wrangel Mountains Center.

00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:18.180
 Right?

00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:19.780
 And this is it.

00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:22.520
 In this expansive setting of a gorgeous ice plateau

00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:23.800
 between high mountains,

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:27.520
 the pair noticed more than just tufts of moss.

00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:29.160
 She saw a handsome young leader

00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:30.880
 who wanted to solve glacier problems.

00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:33.000
 He saw an attractive, worldly biologist

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.680
 who loved being outside, powered by flirty energy.

00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:39.040
 They started thinking about how to study these moss balls

00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:40.320
 and they're married now.

00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:41.160
 (laughing)

00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:44.720
 - Do you think it was the bowls that made them horny?

00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:47.920
 - I don't know what prompted the spark to the romance,

00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:51.540
 but I love the idea of proposing with a little moss ball

00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:54.420
 that you open up and the ring is in there.

00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:55.860
 That would be nice.

00:47:55.860 --> 00:47:57.420
 And there's also another guy called Hotterling

00:47:57.420 --> 00:47:58.780
 about whom little is related,

00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:01.620
 but he's the third scientist involved.

00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:04.140
 - There's a woman called Robin Wall Kimmerer

00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:06.100
 who I suspect some of you have come across

00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:08.300
 who seems to have written this brilliant book about moss.

00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:09.300
 I've only read reviews of it,

00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:12.100
 but she's sort of the moss pro.

00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:15.020
 And she looked a lot at moss traditions

00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:16.700
 in the Arctic in this area

00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:17.880
 and how people have used it.

00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:19.800
 And it's had so many purposes.

00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:24.000
 So people would make pillows out of moss.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:25.400
 There's a specific type of moss

00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:28.240
 that was very good for pillows called hypnum moss.

00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:29.600
 And the reason it's called that

00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:30.960
 is because it was used as a pillow

00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:32.520
 and it was thought if you slept on it,

00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:33.680
 it gives you special dreams.

00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:36.080
 So it's hypnum, like, you know,

00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:37.320
 hypnotizing dreams. - Wow, that's cool.

00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:40.720
 Do you think that if you got one of these moss balls,

00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:43.080
 then, you know, when your pillow gets too warm,

00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:44.640
 it can turn itself over?

00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:46.980
 - No. - Oh, lovely.

00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:48.140
 - So slowly, though,

00:48:48.140 --> 00:48:50.820
 you'd have to sit up for five minutes, probably.

00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:55.580
 They were used as nappies and sanitary towels,

00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:56.420
 which does make sense

00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:58.740
 'cause we've talked about hypnum moss before,

00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:01.500
 which can absorb 40 times its body weight in water.

00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:02.700
 It's pretty good.

00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:04.420
 And you could leave that nappy on for a week.

00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:05.700
 It's the dream. - Speak to someone

00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:06.540
 who's a mother.

00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:09.380
 You're fine, you're fine.

00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:12.060
 I can't smell anything, you're fine.

00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:15.320
 - I got a quiz question for you guys, very quickly.

00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:16.640
 Okay, here's the question.

00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:18.880
 What color is Oscar the Grouch?

00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:19.960
 - Green.

00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:20.960
 - Yeah, I'd say green.

00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:22.280
 - Brrr, yeah.

00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:24.600
 - That's the QI klaxon going there.

00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:26.560
 Oscar the Grouch is orange.

00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:27.480
 - Is he?

00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:28.760
 - So why is he green?

00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:30.440
 It's because he's moss. - Oh, it's living in his fur.

00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:32.180
 - It's because he's been living in a bin so long,

00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:36.280
 he's entirely covered in moss and mold.

00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:37.120
 - That's very good.

00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:38.560
 - His eye's so grouchy.

00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:40.120
 - Yeah.

00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:41.720
 So he's officially explained.

00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:43.780
 He said the first year I show myself in my true colors,

00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:45.900
 which is orange, actually I'm still orange.

00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:47.580
 If I ever took a bath, you'd see that.

00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:50.020
 This is mold and moss, it makes me happy.

00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:51.660
 - Oh, okay, yeah. - Wow, that's so funny.

00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:54.620
 - When's a good time for me to ask who Oscar the Grouch is?

00:49:54.620 --> 00:49:56.300
 - Wow, okay. - After the show.

00:49:56.300 --> 00:49:58.260
 - Yeah. - Okay, great, okay.

00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:01.220
 - Sesame Street, Sesame Street, he lives in the bin.

00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:02.380
 - I thought so, okay.

00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:05.300
 - Have you guys heard of Emmanuel the Grouchy?

00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:06.460
 - Ooh, nice.

00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:08.380
 - He was one of Napoleon's marshals

00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:09.460
 at the Battle of Waterloo.

00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:11.420
 I only remember this 'cause we talked about Waterloo

00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:13.320
 a few weeks ago. - Yes.

00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:17.080
 - And one of the main guys there was Emmanuel the Grouchy

00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:19.880
 and Napoleon made him like the Marshal of all France

00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:21.120
 or something like that.

00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:22.520
 - Well, there were six other marshals, weren't there?

00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:25.180
 There was Happy, Sleepy, Dopey.

00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:30.720
 Okay, giant moss, most moss is tiny, obviously, isn't it?

00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:33.360
 It's close to the ground, it's low, it's not,

00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:34.840
 you don't get moss trees.

00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:37.840
 The gigantic moss, the biggest moss on the planet

00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:41.820
 is called Dorsonia Superba and it gets up to 60 centimeters

00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:43.860
 tall and that is mega.

00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:44.980
 For a moss, that's insane.

00:50:44.980 --> 00:50:46.180
 - That's big. - That is big.

00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:49.100
 - And it's because mosses don't have internal fluid systems

00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:50.900
 to carry water to their tissues.

00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:52.340
 So they can dry out really easily,

00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:53.820
 so they have to stay close to the ground.

00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:55.500
 But Dorsonia has, it's so weird,

00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:57.060
 it's done convergent evolution.

00:50:57.060 --> 00:50:59.220
 So you know how trees have a xylem and a flow

00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:01.180
 and they have the system of porting water

00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:02.600
 all the way up to the leaves.

00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:05.420
 But Dorsonia has evolved a completely separate

00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:08.560
 conduction system that functions in the same way.

00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:11.040
 And so as a result, they can reach for the sky

00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:12.720
 and they grow much bigger as a result.

00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:14.640
 But that's very unusual.

00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:16.000
 - How big are we talking?

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:17.240
 - I said 60 centimeters.

00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:18.080
 - 60 centimeters.

00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:19.760
 - It's not six zero.

00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:22.160
 - Imagine two school rulers.

00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:23.080
 - Yeah.

00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:23.920
 - Yeah.

00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:24.840
 - One on top of the other.

00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:25.680
 - Yeah.

00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:26.760
 - That's how tall we're talking here.

00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:27.600
 - Huge.

00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:30.560
 - Yeah, it's a similar reveal for the peanut

00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:32.040
 to the almond size, I would say.

00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:32.900
 (laughing)

00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:33.740
 - What?

00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:37.240
 - This must be like, it must be 1,000 times taller

00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:38.440
 than your average moss.

00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:39.280
 - No, it's incredible.

00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:40.120
 - Hundreds.

00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:42.380
 - And mosses, I don't think we've ever mentioned

00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:47.140
 that sort of the individual leaves are what are so tiny.

00:51:47.140 --> 00:51:49.080
 They're only one cell thick.

00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:51.640
 Isn't it so odd that we're looking at stuff

00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:53.640
 that we can see and it looks thick

00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:56.240
 and it covers rocks and tarmac and roofs and whatever.

00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:58.800
 Each leaf is one cell thick,

00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:02.800
 which means 100th of a millimeter, basically.

00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:03.920
 - It's small.

00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:05.240
 - It's small, yeah.

00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:08.780
 Some of them deliberately make themselves smell like poo

00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:10.120
 or corpses.

00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:12.660
 So this is--

00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:13.500
 - Why is that?

00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:15.980
 Because like plants do it so that insects come

00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:17.380
 and they get pollinated, right?

00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:19.500
 But that can't be 'cause they don't have pollen.

00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:20.900
 - No, no, same thing.

00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:23.980
 Same thing, so they get, so dispersing their seeds.

00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:25.660
 So most of them disperse via spores.

00:52:25.660 --> 00:52:26.660
 They get taken by the wind

00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:30.380
 and they can get taken amazing distances across continents.

00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:33.200
 But there are certain moss and one of the species

00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:35.680
 is called splachnums ferricum,

00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:38.520
 which is also known as pink stick dung moss.

00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:40.880
 And it lives on droppings.

00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:42.600
 And in fact, all of dung moss lives

00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:44.280
 on very specific types of dung.

00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:48.040
 So pink stick dung moss lives only on the droppings

00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:50.240
 of white-tailed deer about a month

00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:52.200
 after they've been pooed out.

00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:55.440
 And it grows on these droppings.

00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:57.000
 And then it uses these droppings

00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.240
 to make this amazing poo scent,

00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:02.300
 which it emits, which attracts all of these flies,

00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:03.340
 which come to lay their eggs.

00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:05.220
 And as they lay their eggs all over the moss,

00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:07.660
 they pick up these clusters of spores on their legs.

00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:09.660
 And so they disseminate them.

00:53:09.660 --> 00:53:11.420
 - That's amazing.

00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:12.740
 - I think I've got a different impression

00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:14.940
 of what moss is to maybe other people

00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:17.460
 because it's so mad that there's the idea

00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:20.060
 that moss has basically sperm in an egg

00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:23.060
 and that the sperm needs to find its way to an egg.

00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:25.460
 I thought moss just happened.

00:53:25.460 --> 00:53:27.100
 I didn't think the egg-- - Did you?

00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:28.420
 - Yeah, I did, absolutely.

00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:29.620
 - I thought, I didn't realize it was--

00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:31.680
 - Are you an ancient Greek naturalist?

00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:32.920
 (laughing)

00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:36.560
 - He's middle-aged's spontaneous generationalist.

00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:39.260
 - But I agree with Dan, the idea of sperm

00:53:39.260 --> 00:53:41.480
 and moss reproduction generally in moss sex

00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:42.840
 is so hard to get your head around.

00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:44.560
 And they sort of come in two phases of life.

00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:47.560
 But the way that the sperm find the egg

00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:51.540
 seems to be that certain male moss will produce sperm

00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:53.940
 in like a cup on top of them often

00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:56.280
 and then get splashed by raindrops,

00:53:56.280 --> 00:54:00.100
 it also finds a way to swim to an egg of a female moss

00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:01.300
 and sex it up.

00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:03.700
 And that makes another moss that makes spores.

00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:06.340
 And understandably, I think they often don't do this

00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:08.020
 very often at all 'cause it's a lot of effort.

00:54:08.020 --> 00:54:11.140
 So I read an article featuring a biologist

00:54:11.140 --> 00:54:13.740
 called Kirstin Fisher who studies the sex lives

00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:16.580
 of a moss called Syntricia caninervous.

00:54:16.580 --> 00:54:19.180
 And she said they have sex about every 30 years.

00:54:19.180 --> 00:54:20.340
 So she's been in the field all the time.

00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:24.340
 - Well, you know, you're tired, you've been at work.

00:54:24.340 --> 00:54:26.360
 - It's so easy to just...

00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:29.440
 - Darling, it's been 29 years and 11 months.

00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:31.760
 (all laughing)

00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:33.200
 - That's so funny.

00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:34.240
 Oh my goodness.

00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:36.240
 What an amazing thing to study.

00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:38.700
 What a hero in a way.

00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:41.400
 Get on early, the sex life of a very particular moss

00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:43.280
 that only has sex every 30 years.

00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:46.000
 Here's one thing.

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.120
 You've been in World War II.

00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:49.680
 It's been a pretty tough time.

00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:51.320
 You've been living in Europe.

00:54:51.320 --> 00:54:55.260
 Why would it be good to be a moss enthusiast?

00:54:55.260 --> 00:54:58.140
 - So there's lots of moss suddenly growing

00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:02.820
 in areas which have been abandoned due to the war?

00:55:02.820 --> 00:55:03.760
 - That's very good.

00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:05.000
 - Lots of dead people?

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:05.840
 Lots of dead people.

00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:07.460
 There's a kind of moss that grows on corpses?

00:55:07.460 --> 00:55:08.300
 - Oh, there might be.

00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:09.700
 No, this is more practical.

00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:10.540
 - Okay.

00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:13.340
 - There's a very famous moss scientist in America

00:55:13.340 --> 00:55:16.580
 who named lots of mosses called Geneva Sare.

00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:18.620
 And at the end of the war,

00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:22.100
 she organized the sending of food, clothes, and money

00:55:22.100 --> 00:55:25.880
 to distressed bryologists in Europe.

00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:28.960
 So like if you were a moss scientist in Europe,

00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:31.280
 you could expect a nice little package of money

00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:32.320
 and clothes to come.

00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:33.160
 - I love that.

00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:34.640
 - I see moss people stick together.

00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:35.480
 That's great.

00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:37.020
 - Why are they particularly distressed?

00:55:37.020 --> 00:55:37.860
 Were they particularly distressed?

00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:40.140
 And bryologists are moss studyers, I think.

00:55:40.140 --> 00:55:41.540
 - Yeah.

00:55:41.540 --> 00:55:43.140
 Well, it's not that they're particularly distressed.

00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:44.400
 It's just that the industry is,

00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:46.260
 she's looking out for people who share her line of work.

00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:47.100
 - That's exactly it.

00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:49.480
 - Basically the entirety of Europe

00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:51.580
 was distressed after World War II.

00:55:51.580 --> 00:55:55.360
 And the bryologists were no exception.

00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:58.400
 And she thought, well, I'm gonna send some money over,

00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:01.700
 but I wanna send it to fellow moss, moss lovers.

00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:02.540
 - Someone gets in touch.

00:56:02.540 --> 00:56:04.820
 I studied lichen and I am, I really am quite distressed.

00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:05.660
 - No.

00:56:05.660 --> 00:56:06.500
 - Absolutely not.

00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:07.340
 No, get out.

00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:08.160
 (laughing)

00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:10.740
 (upbeat music)

00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:13.980
 - Okay, that's it.

00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:14.980
 That is all of our facts.

00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:16.380
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:18.260
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

00:56:18.260 --> 00:56:19.380
 about the things that we've said

00:56:19.380 --> 00:56:20.660
 over the course of this podcast,

00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:23.460
 we can all be found on various bits of social media

00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:24.700
 out there, I'm on Instagram.

00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:26.380
 You can get me on @Sriberland.

00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:27.560
 James?

00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:28.940
 - I'm on TikTok.

00:56:28.940 --> 00:56:30.860
 I haven't ticked any talks.

00:56:30.860 --> 00:56:33.060
 And I mentioned it a few weeks ago

00:56:33.060 --> 00:56:36.860
 and I now have 44 followers, 45 followers.

00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:38.380
 So, you know, if you wanna boost,

00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:40.300
 you won't get anything in return.

00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:42.500
 But if you wanna come and see me on TikTok,

00:56:42.500 --> 00:56:44.820
 I'm at no such thing as James Harkin.

00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:48.100
 - Right, so that's where not to get in contact with James.

00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:49.420
 Andy?

00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:51.060
 - I'm on Twitter @AndreHunterM.

00:56:51.060 --> 00:56:52.580
 A lot of people also say they don't get anything

00:56:52.580 --> 00:56:54.900
 out of my stuff, but I do actually post quite frequently.

00:56:54.900 --> 00:56:57.060
 (laughing)

00:56:57.060 --> 00:56:58.340
 - Or you can get through to all of us

00:56:58.340 --> 00:56:59.340
 by going to our group account,

00:56:59.340 --> 00:57:00.860
 which is @NoSuchThing on Twitter,

00:57:00.860 --> 00:57:04.580
 or you can email us on podcast@QI.com.

00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:05.860
