00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Hey guys, James here. So we have an announcement to make before we start today's show and that is that we have been offered our own TV show on the BBC on BBC 2.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 It's going to be on at the end of May and we are absolutely delighted and slashed terrified very terrified.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 So what's going to happen is we're going to do a pilot very soon and you can get tickets to come and see that.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 If you go to qi.com/fishervents and the podcast you're about to hear is actually another kind of pilot that we did so you'll kind of see that the facts are a little bit newsy but actually we get into the podcast pretty quickly so you might not even notice.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Okay, on with the show.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Hello and welcome to my such thing as a fish. My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting here with Anna Chazinski, James Harkin and Andy Murray and once again we have gathered around to discuss the most interesting facts we've found from last week and in no particular order.

7
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Here we go. Starting with you, James Harkin.

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Okay, my fact this week is that this week the queen will celebrate her 669th birthday.

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Because she's a lizard. They're all lizards.

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Lizards, those famous animals that live for 600 years. She's a sponge. She's a very ancient sponge, I have to say.

11
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Okay, so what this is basically is we all know the queen has her actual birthday which is this week and she also has an official birthday which when all their parties are and stuff like that.

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 But she also has official birthdays in all the different Commonwealth countries and so I went through all of them and found out when the dates were and some of them kind of coincide with each other.

13
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 So this is something quite some time to work out and I worked out that she has had 668 birthdays and their 669th will be this week.

14
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Actually, there are some countries that used to be in the Commonwealth which aren't any more. There's quite a lot of them and I couldn't really be bothered working them out.

15
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 But I kind of assume the queen isn't really celebrating those anyway so I'm going for 669th.

16
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 She could be even older. No, no. She could be a thousand. No, no, no. She's still the age we think she is. She's just celebrating a lot of birthdays.

17
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 I worked out that if she is that age, 669 years old, she was born. Well, she isn't, by the way.

18
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 But it means that if she is, then while all of us are here in 2016, she's actually living in the year 2500 and 92.

19
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 And that's very exciting. See, I worked it out the other way that she was born in 1347.

20
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 I think we're both wrong.

21
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 We're actually recording this on Wednesday so she's recording but she's celebrating it today and tomorrow, which is Thursday, the 21st.

22
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Today, she started celebrating by visiting the Royal Mail and looking at...

23
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 ...to look for cards coming in. Money!

24
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Yeah, she went to the Royal Mail salty office and had a look around there.

25
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 She wasn't picking up a parcel.

26
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 Yeah, that could be it. No, no. I think they had a new stamp out of something like that.

27
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 She is, and do you know the tweet that she tweeted? Because she tweets, obviously.

28
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 Yeah, like you. Like me. 669-year-old Queen is more modern than I am.

29
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 Yeah, so she sent a tweet out. It's from her Twitter feed, which I think is like @BritishMonarchy or something.

30
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 And it showed the people at the Royal Mail singing Happy Birthday.

31
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 And then it said, "The first of many renditions of Happy Birthday for the Queen."

32
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 And I thought that was quite cocky.

33
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 What if that's the only one, which is going to feel like an idiot?

34
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 So the Queen is 90 in human years and 669 in Queen years.

35
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 But other things that she is as old as in human years, television, liquid fuel rockets,

36
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Winnie the Pooh, and the drug PCP.

37
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 And she, I believe, is going to celebrate by combining all four of those things.

38
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 Does she still send around? She doesn't still send cars to every single 100-year-old, does she?

39
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 Well, she does, but you have to apply a few weeks before, but you do get a card.

40
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 And you also get a card from Ian Duncan Smith.

41
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 No, you won't, no, you won't anymore, sorry, because he's just resigned.

42
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 But you get a card from the work and pension secretary.

43
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 So now you'll get one from Stephen Crab, guys.

44
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 Very cool.

45
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 And then a long letter from Ian Duncan Smith saying, "You want to hang out? I got nothing on."

46
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 Do you know who takes over if the Queen were to become infirm in some way,

47
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 but without abdicating or anything like that?

48
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 Ian Duncan Smith?

49
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 No. Michael Gove.

50
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 Oh God.

51
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 What?

52
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 So he is the Lord Chancellor at the moment, and it's it, I mean, the last time it happened was in the 19th century with George III.

53
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 But the Lord Chancellor...

54
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 Have you met Michael Gove? Is that old?

55
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 Yeah.

56
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 Oh, the lizardy gove.

57
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 No, I think what, is it not that he gets to kind of say that they have to have a regent,

58
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 and the regent will probably be Prince Charles?

59
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 Oh, I'm not sure.

60
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 I thought it was that he carries out the royal duties.

61
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 Yes, it's a badge with Prince Philip.

62
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 Oh, call on Gove.

63
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 Oh, that goes the OBE.

64
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 There's a lot of stuff going about, a little bit of trivia about her this week,

65
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 because on the first day, one I really liked, she doesn't have a passport.

66
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 Because in the British passport, there's a thing saying that she requests that all of anyone holding a British passport

67
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 be allowed into those countries.

68
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 So therefore, because she's made the request, it's kind of said,

69
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 "I've requested, but can you get my mates in as well?"

70
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 And so, she doesn't need to physically carry it.

71
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 I think it's that, or she needs to hope someone in front of her in the immigration queue

72
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 has the British passport, so she can go just read the name.

73
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 But I'm quite confused about this, because she also doesn't have a driving license famously.

74
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 She doesn't need to have a driving license, even though she drives.

75
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 So I don't know, A, how she buys alcohol.

76
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 I think she might just about pass for over 21.

77
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 But be held as she, when she was walking into those countries,

78
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 any of us could impersonate the Queen.

79
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 We could all just put on a wig and say, "I'm the Queen, I don't need a passport.

80
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Let me into your country."

81
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 They say, "Oh, do you have a driving license to prove you are?"

82
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 No, I don't have a driving license, Google it.

83
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 And you're in.

84
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 Where for try?

85
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 Although the Queen does muck around with her own identity of being.

86
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 So recently, one of the former Royal Protection Officers told the story about

87
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 'cause he worked with her for about 30 years, and she was out for a walk near Balmoral,

88
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 her estate there, and they bumped into a group of American tourists.

89
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 And they said, they spoke to her, they said, "Does she live in the area?"

90
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 And she said, "Well, I've got a house in the area."

91
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 It's very modest.

92
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 And they said, "Have you ever met the Queen?"

93
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 And she said, "No."

94
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 And then she pointed at the Royal Protection Officer and she said, "But he has."

95
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 That's cruel.

96
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 She gets some good gift birthday presents and general presents whenever she visits anywhere.

97
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 Okay.

98
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 And so they range from, I think last year, a horse breeder called Christina Patano

99
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 gave her £5,000 worth of stud sperm, a horse sperm, so that she could sperm up horses.

100
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 Oh, sorry.

101
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 £5,000?

102
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 £5,000?

103
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 £5,000?

104
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 £5,000?

105
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 No, £5,000.

106
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 Yeah.

107
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 There's one tired stallion.

108
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 Maybe I can think of the Queen.

109
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 That's two OBS down there.

110
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 It's just you and me now, Nick.

111
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 Did they actually give her the sperm itself?

112
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 'Cause I heard that this lady, Christina Patano,

113
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 offered to let one of the Royal Mers visit her stallion, Big Bad Bob.

114
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 But she gets quite cumbersome gifts and I always wonder with this sort of thing,

115
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 how she gets them home.

116
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 So Brazil has given her two slots.

117
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 She got a married canoe when she went to New Zealand.

118
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 Well, she put the slots in the canoe.

119
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 What do you think she rode home?

120
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 She also got given seven kilos of prawns on one occasion.

121
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Oh, my God.

122
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 She already...

123
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 It's the most boring sentence I've ever heard.

124
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 Queen being sent seven kilos of prawns.

125
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 I got a very fascinating sentence.

126
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 It's got a possibility.

127
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 The Queen sent an email in 1976.

128
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 Nope.

129
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 There's the most boring sentence I've ever heard.

130
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 The sledge in goes too far.

131
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 And more than there it is.

132
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 But what did the email say?

133
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 Do we know?

134
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 No, I know her username though.

135
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 Oh, come on.

136
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 Oh, really?

137
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 Yeah, a Big Bad Bob.

138
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 No.

139
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 It was HME to her majesty Elizabeth II.

140
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 And it was an extremely boring email.

141
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 I think it said this is her majesty,

142
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 the Queen sending an email of something like that.

143
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 It was really awesome stuff.

144
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 Anything else before we move on?

145
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 She's been to the moon, in a sense.

146
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Keep talking.

147
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 When Apollo 11 landed on the moon,

148
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 Neil Armstrong took out a special message,

149
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 a congratulatory message saying well done on getting to the moon.

150
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 And left it there.

151
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 Deliberately.

152
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 I think his instructions were to just leave it in the metal canister

153
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 on the surface of the moon.

154
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 And the message was from the Queen.

155
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 Yeah.

156
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 Okay.

157
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 That's not going to the moon.

158
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 It's not like everyone who's got the birthday letter from the Queen says,

159
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 "Oh, the Queen came round to my house."

160
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 Okay, let's move on to our next fact.

161
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 Time for fact number two.

162
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 And that is Anichesensky.

163
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 Yeah, my fact is that the Brazilian advice president accidentally released

164
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 his presidential acceptance speech by sending it to the wrong WhatsApp group.

165
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 I should add, so he claims,

166
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 that skepticism about this.

167
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 But, yeah, I don't know.

168
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 So Brazil has been in a bit of turmoil recently, a political turmoil.

169
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 The president, Dilma Rousseff, has just Congress, the lower house,

170
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 and Brazil has just voted to impeach her.

171
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 But before they voted to impeach her,

172
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 the vice president, Michelle Timmer,

173
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 was obviously practicing his,

174
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 "Oh, once she gets kicked out, I need to make a speech,

175
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 and I better work out what that's going to be."

176
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 And he recorded a 15-minute long speech.

177
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 And then sent it, he said, intended to send it to one friend,

178
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 and accidentally sent it to the WhatsApp group that must have been just below,

179
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 which was a whole bunch of MPs and lawyers.

180
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 We've all done it.

181
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 But sending a 15-minute speech by audio,

182
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 that's going to take ages on WhatsApp.

183
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 That's going to load.

184
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 So, either he put it down, or he spent 15 minutes going,

185
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 "Ah!" "The terrifying 15-moments and politics."

186
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 No, there are theories that this was an intentional move to state

187
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 that he did not feel good about the current president.

188
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 But yeah, he says WhatsApp error.

189
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 So they've just voted, haven't they, the lower house you said,

190
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 to impeach the president?

191
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 The thing is, the lower house is also in a bit of turmoil.

192
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 I didn't realise that Brazil has quite as big a corruption problem as it does.

193
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 So, of the 594 members of the Congress who voted,

194
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 60% of them are currently under investigation or facing investigation.

195
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 For, and I'm quoting here, serious charges like bribery,

196
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 electoral fraud, illegal deforestation, kidnapping, and homicide.

197
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 I think, yeah, that's Congress and the Senate, the 594.

198
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 So it's in both houses.

199
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 So at the moment it's just gone through Congress, and there are, yeah,

200
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 like 303 out of 513, but then as soon as the vote goes to the Senate,

201
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 an even higher proportion of them are really corrupt.

202
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 And the three people in line to replace her when she is impeached

203
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 are all also facing criminal corruption charges.

204
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 It's a real good situation out there.

205
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 That's true.

206
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 And they're all protesting at the moment, aren't they in Brazil?

207
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 They are.

208
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 I read that in the last year, there's been more protesters in Brazil

209
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 than the entire rest of the world combined.

210
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 What?

211
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Wow.

212
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 It's like literally like 3 million at a time, just complaining.

213
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 Yeah.

214
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 That's true.

215
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 Just complaining.

216
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 The Harkin Institute, the democracy and the will of the people.

217
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 I just go out on the streets of my plaque, how to go.

218
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 But isn't it the case as well that they had,

219
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 they pro-government protesters and the anti-government protesters

220
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 and they've just put a big wall in the middle of them?

221
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 Yes.

222
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 They've thought, well, what's a good example from the past,

223
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 we're a massive wall between two groups of people who disagree

224
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 has solved a problem.

225
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 Yeah.

226
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 Two meters high, right down the middle of the capital city.

227
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 Wow.

228
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 That's amazing.

229
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 Just taking it back to the kind of incompetence of politicians

230
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 with social media.

231
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 I thought I found one that has really good intentions,

232
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 but it has slightly gone wrong as well.

233
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 So I don't know if you guys know this, but on Twitter.

234
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 Sweden has a, it's a country that has an official Twitter account.

235
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 Oh, yeah.

236
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 So it's @Sweden.

237
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 And so you think, okay, who runs @Sweden?

238
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 They made the decision that they're going to allow

239
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 their own members of the public.

240
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 Run it.

241
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 One person at a time, one week at a time.

242
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 So they just hand it over.

243
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 And so the current person running it is called Isabel.

244
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 This is her pin tweet.

245
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 I don't do Fika.

246
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 I don't do dating.

247
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 I drink beer and fuck.

248
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 That is the official first tweet you see from Sweden.

249
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 Did you see that as well that you can ring up Sweden?

250
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 Has anyone seen this?

251
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 This is pretty cool, isn't it?

252
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 Like they have a phone number and you can just call up

253
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 and they just connect you to a random suite.

254
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 Yeah.

255
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 That sounds great.

256
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 So someone's at home and their phone's ringing.

257
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 Yeah.

258
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 You just pick it up and...

259
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 You sign up for it.

260
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 You sign up for this thing.

261
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 And then someone from anywhere around the world at any time

262
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 can just ring you up and say hi.

263
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 Is that Sweden?

264
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 And you say, yeah, I'm into fucking, you know?

265
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 Or whatever.

266
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 I sign up for it if there was ring a British person.

267
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 Would you really dial a Brit?

268
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 Yeah.

269
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 Because like in the office you don't really like talking to us.

270
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 No, but you notice I constantly stare at my phone looking haunted and alone.

271
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 So on politicians and social media, Jeremy Corbyn has been doing a big social media push

272
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 and has joined Snapchat.

273
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 I see.

274
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 Which is what exactly, please.

275
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 So I'm pretty sure.

276
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 I think is it where people send naked photos themselves

277
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 so that people they're having a fairs with?

278
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 Yes.

279
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 And then they...

280
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 I'm not sure that's exactly what Jeremy Corbyn will be doing with it.

281
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 But yeah, it's that one where, yeah, the photo disappears.

282
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 You probably all know that.

283
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 So he's joined Snapchat.

284
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 And he's posted a few photos.

285
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 Some of his first ones, a few of them were sideways.

286
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 And one of them was extremely blurry.

287
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 And then most of them, it was of him, signing forms.

288
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 But yeah, and he's also joined Instagram.

289
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 And his first post was of a tonics t-cake.

290
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 It's very exciting actually.

291
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 It's very exciting stuff going on in Jeremy Corbyn's social media company.

292
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 No, it's good to see them embracing it.

293
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 I think it's really cool.

294
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 But yeah, they do get it spectacularly wrong sometimes.

295
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 On Twitter, there was...

296
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 I thought this was great.

297
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 There was a Dutch politician.

298
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 This was back in 2011.

299
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 I apologise for the rudeness of this in advance.

300
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 But he was sending a text, which he thought he was sending to a lover.

301
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 And he accidentally tweeted it.

302
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 And the...

303
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 Yeah.

304
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 The @bigbadball.

305
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 So the translation of the tweet roughly goes as you throbbingly climax

306
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 for the first time I feel in my mouth

307
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 as if they were the nectar of love.

308
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 Right?

309
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 He didn't lose his job off the tweet.

310
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 But he did gain 20 new followers.

311
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 So sometimes it works in their favour.

312
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 Just some basic facts about this kind of thing.

313
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp and that kind of thing is so popular now.

314
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 A lot more than any other kind of ways of communicating.

315
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 So there are 60 billion messages every day through some kind of Messenger.

316
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 And that's first is 23 billion by text message.

317
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 And that means in two days there are more messages sent than humans have ever been alive.

318
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 Whoa.

319
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 Oh, God.

320
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 Yeah.

321
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 It's absolutely massive in Brazil as well, isn't it?

322
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 That's why this is happening.

323
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 So I think the Brazilian sent twice...

324
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 Use WhatsApp on...

325
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 What?

326
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 I'm just going to...

327
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 None of these words are familiar to me before today.

328
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 I'm really sorry.

329
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 Which you called it snappity chat.

330
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 Residians.

331
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 Use social media even more than I do.

332
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 No, they spend twice as much time on social media as Americans.

333
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 Which I would have thought is going over 100% of the time that you're alive.

334
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 In China as well, ginormous.

335
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 So they have a version of Twitter out there which is called Sino Weibu.

336
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 It's ginormous.

337
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 Stephen Hawking joined it just a couple of days ago.

338
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 We got two million followers in 24 hours.

339
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 Like that's just how quickly and what a massive group you can get.

340
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 But he had two million and 20 after he accidentally...

341
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 Well, he is sending his tweets in Chinese.

342
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 And apparently just from the reports I'm reading that people are saying...

343
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 I have no idea what he's saying.

344
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 It's in Chinese but I have no idea what he's saying.

345
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 But I'd like to just say thanks for being on here.

346
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 So they kind of really appreciate the fact that such a cool guy's on there.

347
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 Despite the fact he's making no sense of those tweets.

348
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 There is a Chinese...

349
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 I think it's a Chinese instant messaging app.

350
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 And I think it's a dating app.

351
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 I'm going off memory here so I'm not sure on the details.

352
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 But if you send a message which says something like,

353
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 "Do you want to get a room?"

354
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 Or something like that.

355
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 If you put in particular characters, it flashes up with a warning saying,

356
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 "You're sure about that."

357
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 That's amazing.

358
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 If only you're a throbbingly nexoman.

359
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 What about that?

360
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 So about presidents and stuff like this.

361
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 So President Obama is the only person outside HBO

362
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 who's going to watch Game of Thrones before it goes on air.

363
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 Okay.

364
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 Now we know his real agenda.

365
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 And there was a journalist who was called Vanessa Golembefsky

366
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 who thought, "If the president has a file of Game of Thrones,

367
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 then surely I can get that file through freedom of information."

368
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 And so she's going to President Obama saying,

369
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 "I want this file through freedom of information."

370
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 And they're going to see if they can get it.

371
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 But the only problem is that the average amount of time to get a file

372
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 is 121 days.

373
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 And by that time, we'll have already seen it by about two months.

374
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 It's the principal.

375
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 It's the principal, exactly.

376
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 But it's a nice idea, isn't it?

377
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 Just some world leaders I was reading today that Vladimir Putin

378
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 did a Q&A, a sort of big wide Q&A where anyone could ask questions.

379
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 And I looked through the Q&A, they translated it into English.

380
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 And my favorite question was from a 12-year-old girl who asked him

381
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 who he would save if these people were drowning,

382
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 the Turkish president or the Ukrainian leader.

383
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 Who would you save if that was the situation?

384
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 12-year-old girl.

385
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 And Putin said, "If someone has decided to drown,

386
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 it's probably already impossible to save them anyway."

387
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 He did say, "Oh, but we would lend a helping hand to whoever's in need."

388
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 But that was his first response.

389
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 Okay, it is tied for fact number three.

390
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 And that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

391
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 My fact is that a German city is fighting global terror

392
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 by banning number plates starting with IS.

393
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 Every little health.

394
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 Yeah, absolutely.

395
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 As a city of Marburg in Germany,

396
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 and if you want to get a special license plate,

397
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 what's it called? Like a one-off?

398
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 Personalized license plate.

399
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 With IS and start, you will no longer be allowed to do that.

400
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 So you'll have to leave Marburg, get it done somewhere else

401
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 where it's legal and they go back to Marburg.

402
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 That will cost you petrol and it slows down.

403
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 I didn't realise that license plates are so strict.

404
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 So the DVLA is extremely strict about the license plates that can go out.

405
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 And so they have a meeting every six months, I think,

406
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 where they go through and work out all the possible combinations

407
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 that could be construed as rude.

408
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 And so that sounds like a great job, doesn't it?

409
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 So far.

410
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 So much imagination required.

411
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 A lot of them I couldn't quite work out why they would be rude.

412
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 So it's a 49-page document, the latest one, and it is very good reading.

413
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 None of it is appropriate for tonight.

414
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 For instance, there are two letter combinations that are banned.

415
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 Two of the two letter combinations are MN and NF,

416
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 and I have no idea why they're rude.

417
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 Naughty, naughty-fisting.

418
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 Could you tell me a kind of fisting that isn't naughty?

419
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 There's a sense.

420
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 I'm just doing a survey.

421
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 But yeah, they go through and they list all the two letter combinations

422
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 that are banned, all the three letters that are banned.

423
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 So you're not allowed on any number plates.

424
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 C-U-M, C-O-K.

425
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 I think I'm allowed to say all of this because I'm just spelling it out.

426
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 C-N-T, N-T.

427
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 You're an upset because you're not a car.

428
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 Always shattering my dreams, Andy.

429
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 BNP, yeah, I think that's a real stab in the face.

430
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 It's a political party that's not even allowed on number plates.

431
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 So I wonder if instead of naughty-fisting, it's national front.

432
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 Could be the national front.

433
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 I think it's naughty-fisting, though.

434
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 But there are some which really sort of...

435
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 You can't have V-A-6-1-A-N-A because it looks a bit like vagina, right?

436
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 But to me, that looks like vagianna.

437
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 So it's a very odd sort of the rules of really...

438
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 You're not allowed to have A-11-N-O-B, all knob.

439
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 Which, if you get that number plate, is an accurate description of what you are.

440
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 A lot of these aren't personalised, though.

441
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 So don't hold it against that.

442
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 A lot of these are number plates that would be in the standard rotation

443
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 but they have to specifically remove them, like M-A-5-5-T-B-T.

444
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 You see, it takes a lot of thought, yeah.

445
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 See if you can work out this one.

446
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 Wait, hang on a... I didn't get that one.

447
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 Hi, hon, let me show it to you.

448
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 That's very rude.

449
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 Alright, I've got... See if you can work out this one.

450
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 X-351-ARO.

451
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 Oh, this is great radio.

452
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 And if you're playing a log at home, you can write it down.

453
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 So that is, look at it backwards in mirror writing, and it spells out...

454
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 Is it oral sex?

455
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 It's because if you're looking backwards in your car, yeah.

456
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 Yeah, they have to test that. They have to test the mirror writing.

457
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 Smart.

458
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 Although the R would be backwards, so it would be like Russian YAH.

459
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 Have you guys heard...

460
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 James is super fun to have a road trip with, by the way.

461
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 There's a new app that's out, which seems quite an exciting idea.

462
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 It's called Plexed, and the idea is that when you're driving, you need to have...

463
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 So you need to hope this person has the app as well.

464
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 But you can text their license plate, and the text gets through to them.

465
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 So if someone's driving in front of you, and this is what they kind of think it's made for.

466
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 It's like someone's driving in front of you, and they're doing a really good job.

467
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 Why didn't you text them?

468
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 But you're a little out of text while driving.

469
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 I know, I don't know how the system works, but that's what it's meant to be.

470
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 It's meant to be allowing you to communicate with other drivers to tell them good things about their driving.

471
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 I think that's entrapment, legally, isn't it?

472
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 Is it?

473
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 Isn't that when you persuade someone to do a crime, and then you convict them of that crime?

474
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 Well, when they...

475
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 And places on the Catholic Eater Jones film.

476
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 When they finish their...

477
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 But they'll finish their journey, and then they'll safely retrieve their phone from the glove compartment,

478
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 where we all put it when we drive.

479
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 And then they'll turn it on, and then they'll get the message saying good job, maybe.

480
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 Some comedy about ISIS?

481
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 Yes.

482
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 That's why everyone came tonight.

483
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 So in the news this week, there was a guy called Franco Roberty, who is Italy's top prosecutor,

484
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 and he says that Stoners, who are trying to get Marijuana legalised, are helping the fights against ISIS.

485
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 Really?

486
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 No.

487
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 Oh, sorry.

488
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 How quickly the stone is turned in.

489
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 Whatever, yes.

490
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 Whatever.

491
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 Okay.

492
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 The idea is that the Italian mafia and ISIS are working together to kind of bring Marijuana over from North Africa into Italy.

493
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 And they reckon if it was legal, then they wouldn't have that way of making money.

494
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 Wow.

495
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 It's good, isn't it?

496
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 So on the subject of ISIS, I don't know if there are any archer fans in the room, but everyone should be on.

497
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 Yeah.

498
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 One of the radio for the archers.

499
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 Not the archers.

500
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 Archers, the car, oh my god, I've just lost everyone.

501
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 So in archer this TV series, it's about...

502
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 Alright, hang on, hang on, but quickly the archers.

503
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 It's about the stone.

504
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 The stone just is cheering at everything.

505
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 He doesn't know what's going on.

506
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 So...

507
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 Baked out of his gall in the front row.

508
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 You've read those words in a book, actually.

509
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 Drug language of the streets, fifth edition.

510
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 Is this ever going to...

511
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 Am I in archer?

512
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 The main character archer and all his colleagues work for a company called ISIS.

513
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 It's a bunch of spires called ISIS.

514
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 And in 2014, when things started kicking off a little bit elsewhere, then the program makers decided they had to change the name.

515
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 So ISIS, as everyone who watched his archer all know, has been removed from archer.

516
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 And actually there was quite a good episode at the beginning of the series.

517
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 I think it was the first episode of series five or six where you saw in the background as Mallory was on the phone to archer.

518
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 You saw in the background two trucks with ISIS's logo disappearing into the sunset.

519
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 But this created a series problem because it's a really popular show and they had shed loads of merchandise.

520
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 So they just shipped it off to Syria.

521
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 The creator Adam Reid said that in a board meeting, he suggested this jokolim was met with an ISIS silence.

522
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 So he should have been here and said, but he also said that he complained that I gave my dad one of the ISIS hats.

523
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 And in the end, he had to call me and say, "You know son, I'm not going to be able to wear that hat anymore.

524
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 I'm getting some weird looks in the hardware store."

525
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 So I have a list of places which have had to change the name, which were called ISIS and have decided that it's not worth it anymore.

526
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 So there's a mobile banking app. There's a nail salon in Oakland, California, a Danish pudding company, a Belgian chocolate firm, and a wife swapping club in Leeds.

527
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 And presumably they were just getting too much confusion from people.

528
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 People go there and engage in all sorts of fun and frolics and they say it's not worth the aggro.

529
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 So there was the nail salon in Oakland. They changed their name because people were genuinely making rude comments and rude phone calls saying, "I can't believe you guys, you're sick of us."

530
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 And they got some good feedback though because one person sent wrote an online review of, I remind you, a nail salon in California saying, "In the last week, ISIS gave me a real nice treatment.

531
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 I don't know why we are bombing them."

532
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 Okay. It is time for our final fact of the show and that is my fact.

533
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 My fact this week is that the North Pole is on a head-on collision course with Greenwich London.

534
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 Where we are right now.

535
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 This has just happened 20 years ago.

536
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 But we've just noticed. It's been going one way. It's been heading towards Canada, the North Pole.

537
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 And mysteriously, they have no idea why. It's suddenly just flipped. Not a complete flip, but it's changed direction.

538
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 And it is now headed along Greenwich, Meridian. So it is heading right here where we are right now.

539
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 We could be the North Pole in about a lot of millions of years.

540
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 You know they do know why.

541
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 Do they? Have we worked on that?

542
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 That's what they've discovered this week.

543
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 I should have read the article.

544
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 So to be clear, this isn't the Magnetic North Pole, which also moves quite a bit. This is the geographic North Pole.

545
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 So this is just the earth wobbles on its axis because it's not a perfect sphere.

546
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 It's not kind of lumps and bumps on it and it's got different masses in different places.

547
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 So if you imagine sort of spinning a sphere round, then it's like a basketball and you're kind of spinning it on your finger.

548
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 And your finger is where the South Pole would be and then directly above it is where the North Pole would be.

549
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 It's exactly like that. And thank you very much for the metaphor James, similarly.

550
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 And what's happened is they thought at first the reason it was moving was because of the Greenland ice caps melting.

551
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 But actually they've been doing this study since 2005 and they've realised that what it is is a water loss from Eurasia,

552
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 Bizarre, which sort of changes the masses in the earth. So a huge mass of water has been lost from India and from Asia.

553
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 And that's just changed the sort of weighting and the lumps and bumps in the earth and it's caused the earth to start spinning it differently,

554
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 start pivoting differently and it's gradually creeping towards us.

555
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 But it has happened very suddenly, hasn't it?

556
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 We should say the speed at which it's moving, which is 17 centimetres a year, which is about the same as hair growth.

557
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 Yeah, the funny thing about that is because I remember reading a good few years ago that Russia found the geographical North Pole and put a pole in there at the bottom of the ocean and put a Russian flag on it,

558
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 because the geographic North Pole was kind of disputed between Canada, Denmark, I think, and Russia.

559
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 And Russia wanted to say no it's ours and they put a flag there, but it's not there anymore.

560
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 It's like 17 centimetres away from it. But still not exactly where they said it was.

561
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 Are they going to send someone to think all the way there to move it?

562
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 Yeah, maybe, although it's down at the bottom of a very, very cold ocean, so I think maybe not.

563
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 I discovered a fact this week, which I think is really, really interesting, which is in 1985.

564
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 Did you guys know this? Neil Armstrong went to the North Pole.

565
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 Did he?

566
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 Yeah, did you go in the sense that the Queen went to the moon?

567
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 No, because the Queen went, but with a letter from Neil, which he allowed.

568
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 No, Neil Armstrong went to the North Pole with Edmund Hillary.

569
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 So the first man to reach the top of Everest went with the first man to stand on the moon.

570
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 And with Steve Fossett, who was the first person to go around the Earth.

571
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 How do we not know this?

572
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 I know, isn't that really odd? So they flew there. They didn't actually do the track.

573
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 They flew there and they landed and they went to the Pole and it was with Edmund Hillary's son as well, who's also a big explorer.

574
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 And then on their way back, they were staying in a hut, which was still in icy conditions.

575
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 And the storms around them, the icy storms were so great that they got stuck in the hut for a number of days.

576
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 And all they could do was chat. And apparently it was the first time ever that Neil Armstrong completely opened up about his experience on the moon.

577
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 He'd never done that before to anyone.

578
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 And so Peter Hillary, who's the son of Edmund Hillary, has the total scoop on what was said because no one else is alive who was there in that room.

579
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 And what happened?

580
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 He says, all right, he just said, you know, he said left a letter and he went back.

581
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 No, but isn't that amazing Neil Armstrong? And the person who organised it wanted to bring the people who'd done first to the place on Earth where they'd never been before.

582
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 Oh, okay, so it wasn't a big coincidence. They didn't get there.

583
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 Well, you went to the moon. Are you serious?

584
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 I went, okay.

585
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 No, they had the North Pole marathon this week.

586
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 Oh, yes.

587
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 Yeah, it was won by a man from Arkansas and he ran the race in five hours, 17 minutes.

588
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 But the record is three hours, 36 minutes. And the reason is because it really, really matters on the conditions.

589
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 Like, it's not like the London marathon where you've got a bit of rain or something that makes a difference. It makes a massive difference.

590
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 They call it the coolest marathon in the world.

591
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 Yeah.

592
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 And they have pole about guards all along the route.

593
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 Wait, hang on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Are the guards? I see what you're saying here.

594
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 It's people guarding against polar bears.

595
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 Shame.

596
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 Because I would run faster.

597
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 I've looked into the marathon as well.

598
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 The first one happened in 2002. It hasn't been going that long.

599
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 And it only had one participant who was also the organiser.

600
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 Yeah. And the entire course is floating on top of, obviously, on 14,000 feet of Arctic Ocean.

601
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 Interesting thing about the ice, which is that it might be the last time ever that people ever walk to the North Pole.

602
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 Oh, it won't happen that often because the ice is melting. There's not much weight in water.

603
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 And even if you are walking to the North Pole, the ice often moves southwards.

604
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 So you can be walking for days and days and be further away than you were when you started.

605
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 Oh, wow.

606
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 Oh, my God.

607
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 So, yeah, I read there was a guy called Wally Herbert and he was trying to...

608
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 Wally Herbert.

609
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 That's two words, meaning a bit of a dip.

610
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 Really?

611
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 Yeah.

612
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 Well, he was an amazing explorer.

613
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 So he was trying to prove, because there was a lot of dispute about whether a not Peary was the first person.

614
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 So he was trying to recreate the trip and see if he'd made it there.

615
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 So the idea is that Robert Peary claimed to have walked over the North Pole

616
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 and that people kind of not show whether he did or not.

617
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 Yeah, they weren't sure.

618
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 So he tried to recreate it.

619
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 His conclusion was that Peary didn't do it, that he did in fact, Dr. The Books.

620
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 But in doing so, Wally Herbert became the first person to do it.

621
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 So you obviously have to use compasses and work out where the North Pole was

622
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 and because of the shift that's going on all the time, it's hard to tell.

623
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 So they did this marathon track this one day and they got to this point

624
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 where they thought let's stop and let's see where it is.

625
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 And they realized they'd walked past it.

626
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 They got to it, kept walking, didn't bother to check.

627
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 So suddenly they were just like, oh my God, what are we going to do?

628
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 Let's walk back.

629
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 And Wally Herbert said, no, let's not walk back.

630
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 Let's go to sleep.

631
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 They went to sleep and because of the way that it was shifting in the morning,

632
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 they were back at the spot where the North Pole was.

633
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 Oh, really?

634
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 Because they worked out the hours of the shift that would happen.

635
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 So he slept his way to the North Pole.

636
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 Don't say it like that.

637
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 It's not like a bisarival.

638
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 Okay, that's it.

639
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 That's all of our facts.

640
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 Thank you so much for listening.

641
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 See you next week.

642
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 Goodbye.
