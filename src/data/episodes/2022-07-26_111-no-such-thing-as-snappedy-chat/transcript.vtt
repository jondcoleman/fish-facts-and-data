WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 Hey guys, James here. So we have an announcement to make before we start today's show and that is that we have been offered our own TV show on the BBC on BBC 2.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 It's going to be on at the end of May and we are absolutely delighted and slashed terrified very terrified.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 So what's going to happen is we're going to do a pilot very soon and you can get tickets to come and see that.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 If you go to qi.com/fishervents and the podcast you're about to hear is actually another kind of pilot that we did so you'll kind of see that the facts are a little bit newsy but actually we get into the podcast pretty quickly so you might not even notice.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 Okay, on with the show.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 Hello and welcome to my such thing as a fish. My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting here with Anna Chazinski, James Harkin and Andy Murray and once again we have gathered around to discuss the most interesting facts we've found from last week and in no particular order.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 Here we go. Starting with you, James Harkin.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 Okay, my fact this week is that this week the queen will celebrate her 669th birthday.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 Because she's a lizard. They're all lizards.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 Lizards, those famous animals that live for 600 years. She's a sponge. She's a very ancient sponge, I have to say.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 Okay, so what this is basically is we all know the queen has her actual birthday which is this week and she also has an official birthday which when all their parties are and stuff like that.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 But she also has official birthdays in all the different Commonwealth countries and so I went through all of them and found out when the dates were and some of them kind of coincide with each other.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 So this is something quite some time to work out and I worked out that she has had 668 birthdays and their 669th will be this week.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 Actually, there are some countries that used to be in the Commonwealth which aren't any more. There's quite a lot of them and I couldn't really be bothered working them out.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 But I kind of assume the queen isn't really celebrating those anyway so I'm going for 669th.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 She could be even older. No, no. She could be a thousand. No, no, no. She's still the age we think she is. She's just celebrating a lot of birthdays.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 I worked out that if she is that age, 669 years old, she was born. Well, she isn't, by the way.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 But it means that if she is, then while all of us are here in 2016, she's actually living in the year 2500 and 92.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 And that's very exciting. See, I worked it out the other way that she was born in 1347.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 I think we're both wrong.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 We're actually recording this on Wednesday so she's recording but she's celebrating it today and tomorrow, which is Thursday, the 21st.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 Today, she started celebrating by visiting the Royal Mail and looking at...

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 ...to look for cards coming in. Money!

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 Yeah, she went to the Royal Mail salty office and had a look around there.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 She wasn't picking up a parcel.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 Yeah, that could be it. No, no. I think they had a new stamp out of something like that.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 She is, and do you know the tweet that she tweeted? Because she tweets, obviously.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 Yeah, like you. Like me. 669-year-old Queen is more modern than I am.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 Yeah, so she sent a tweet out. It's from her Twitter feed, which I think is like @BritishMonarchy or something.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 And it showed the people at the Royal Mail singing Happy Birthday.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 And then it said, "The first of many renditions of Happy Birthday for the Queen."

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 And I thought that was quite cocky.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 What if that's the only one, which is going to feel like an idiot?

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 So the Queen is 90 in human years and 669 in Queen years.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 But other things that she is as old as in human years, television, liquid fuel rockets,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 Winnie the Pooh, and the drug PCP.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 And she, I believe, is going to celebrate by combining all four of those things.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 Does she still send around? She doesn't still send cars to every single 100-year-old, does she?

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 Well, she does, but you have to apply a few weeks before, but you do get a card.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 And you also get a card from Ian Duncan Smith.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 No, you won't, no, you won't anymore, sorry, because he's just resigned.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 But you get a card from the work and pension secretary.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
 So now you'll get one from Stephen Crab, guys.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
 Very cool.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 And then a long letter from Ian Duncan Smith saying, "You want to hang out? I got nothing on."

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 Do you know who takes over if the Queen were to become infirm in some way,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 but without abdicating or anything like that?

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 Ian Duncan Smith?

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 No. Michael Gove.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000
 Oh God.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 What?

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 So he is the Lord Chancellor at the moment, and it's it, I mean, the last time it happened was in the 19th century with George III.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 But the Lord Chancellor...

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 Have you met Michael Gove? Is that old?

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 Yeah.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 Oh, the lizardy gove.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 No, I think what, is it not that he gets to kind of say that they have to have a regent,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 and the regent will probably be Prince Charles?

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 Oh, I'm not sure.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 I thought it was that he carries out the royal duties.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 Yes, it's a badge with Prince Philip.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 Oh, call on Gove.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 Oh, that goes the OBE.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 There's a lot of stuff going about, a little bit of trivia about her this week,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 because on the first day, one I really liked, she doesn't have a passport.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 Because in the British passport, there's a thing saying that she requests that all of anyone holding a British passport

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
 be allowed into those countries.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 So therefore, because she's made the request, it's kind of said,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 "I've requested, but can you get my mates in as well?"

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 And so, she doesn't need to physically carry it.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 I think it's that, or she needs to hope someone in front of her in the immigration queue

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 has the British passport, so she can go just read the name.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 But I'm quite confused about this, because she also doesn't have a driving license famously.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 She doesn't need to have a driving license, even though she drives.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 So I don't know, A, how she buys alcohol.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 I think she might just about pass for over 21.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 But be held as she, when she was walking into those countries,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 any of us could impersonate the Queen.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
 We could all just put on a wig and say, "I'm the Queen, I don't need a passport.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 Let me into your country."

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 They say, "Oh, do you have a driving license to prove you are?"

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 No, I don't have a driving license, Google it.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 And you're in.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 Where for try?

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 Although the Queen does muck around with her own identity of being.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 So recently, one of the former Royal Protection Officers told the story about

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 'cause he worked with her for about 30 years, and she was out for a walk near Balmoral,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
 her estate there, and they bumped into a group of American tourists.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 And they said, they spoke to her, they said, "Does she live in the area?"

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 And she said, "Well, I've got a house in the area."

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000
 It's very modest.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 And they said, "Have you ever met the Queen?"

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 And she said, "No."

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 And then she pointed at the Royal Protection Officer and she said, "But he has."

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 That's cruel.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
 She gets some good gift birthday presents and general presents whenever she visits anywhere.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 Okay.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 And so they range from, I think last year, a horse breeder called Christina Patano

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 gave her £5,000 worth of stud sperm, a horse sperm, so that she could sperm up horses.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 Oh, sorry.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 £5,000?

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 £5,000?

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 £5,000?

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 £5,000?

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000
 No, £5,000.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 Yeah.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 There's one tired stallion.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 Maybe I can think of the Queen.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 That's two OBS down there.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 It's just you and me now, Nick.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 Did they actually give her the sperm itself?

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 'Cause I heard that this lady, Christina Patano,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:38.000
 offered to let one of the Royal Mers visit her stallion, Big Bad Bob.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 But she gets quite cumbersome gifts and I always wonder with this sort of thing,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
 how she gets them home.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 So Brazil has given her two slots.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
 She got a married canoe when she went to New Zealand.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 Well, she put the slots in the canoe.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
 What do you think she rode home?

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 She also got given seven kilos of prawns on one occasion.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 Oh, my God.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000
 She already...

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 It's the most boring sentence I've ever heard.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 Queen being sent seven kilos of prawns.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 I got a very fascinating sentence.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 It's got a possibility.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 The Queen sent an email in 1976.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 Nope.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 There's the most boring sentence I've ever heard.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
 The sledge in goes too far.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
 And more than there it is.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 But what did the email say?

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000
 Do we know?

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 No, I know her username though.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000
 Oh, come on.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 Oh, really?

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 Yeah, a Big Bad Bob.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 No.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 It was HME to her majesty Elizabeth II.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 And it was an extremely boring email.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 I think it said this is her majesty,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 the Queen sending an email of something like that.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 It was really awesome stuff.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 Anything else before we move on?

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 She's been to the moon, in a sense.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 Keep talking.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
 When Apollo 11 landed on the moon,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 Neil Armstrong took out a special message,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
 a congratulatory message saying well done on getting to the moon.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 And left it there.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 Deliberately.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 I think his instructions were to just leave it in the metal canister

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 on the surface of the moon.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 And the message was from the Queen.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 Yeah.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 Okay.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 That's not going to the moon.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 It's not like everyone who's got the birthday letter from the Queen says,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
 "Oh, the Queen came round to my house."

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 Okay, let's move on to our next fact.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 Time for fact number two.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 And that is Anichesensky.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
 Yeah, my fact is that the Brazilian advice president accidentally released

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 his presidential acceptance speech by sending it to the wrong WhatsApp group.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 I should add, so he claims,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 that skepticism about this.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 But, yeah, I don't know.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 So Brazil has been in a bit of turmoil recently, a political turmoil.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
 The president, Dilma Rousseff, has just Congress, the lower house,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 and Brazil has just voted to impeach her.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 But before they voted to impeach her,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
 the vice president, Michelle Timmer,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 was obviously practicing his,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
 "Oh, once she gets kicked out, I need to make a speech,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 and I better work out what that's going to be."

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 And he recorded a 15-minute long speech.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 And then sent it, he said, intended to send it to one friend,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 and accidentally sent it to the WhatsApp group that must have been just below,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 which was a whole bunch of MPs and lawyers.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 We've all done it.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 But sending a 15-minute speech by audio,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 that's going to take ages on WhatsApp.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 That's going to load.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 So, either he put it down, or he spent 15 minutes going,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 "Ah!" "The terrifying 15-moments and politics."

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 No, there are theories that this was an intentional move to state

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 that he did not feel good about the current president.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 But yeah, he says WhatsApp error.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
 So they've just voted, haven't they, the lower house you said,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 to impeach the president?

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 The thing is, the lower house is also in a bit of turmoil.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 I didn't realise that Brazil has quite as big a corruption problem as it does.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 So, of the 594 members of the Congress who voted,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 60% of them are currently under investigation or facing investigation.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 For, and I'm quoting here, serious charges like bribery,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 electoral fraud, illegal deforestation, kidnapping, and homicide.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 I think, yeah, that's Congress and the Senate, the 594.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 So it's in both houses.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
 So at the moment it's just gone through Congress, and there are, yeah,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 like 303 out of 513, but then as soon as the vote goes to the Senate,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 an even higher proportion of them are really corrupt.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
 And the three people in line to replace her when she is impeached

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 are all also facing criminal corruption charges.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 It's a real good situation out there.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 That's true.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 And they're all protesting at the moment, aren't they in Brazil?

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 They are.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 I read that in the last year, there's been more protesters in Brazil

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
 than the entire rest of the world combined.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 What?

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.000
 Wow.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 It's like literally like 3 million at a time, just complaining.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 Yeah.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 That's true.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 Just complaining.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 The Harkin Institute, the democracy and the will of the people.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 I just go out on the streets of my plaque, how to go.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 But isn't it the case as well that they had,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 they pro-government protesters and the anti-government protesters

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
 and they've just put a big wall in the middle of them?

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 Yes.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
 They've thought, well, what's a good example from the past,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 we're a massive wall between two groups of people who disagree

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 has solved a problem.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 Yeah.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 Two meters high, right down the middle of the capital city.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 Wow.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 That's amazing.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 Just taking it back to the kind of incompetence of politicians

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 with social media.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 I thought I found one that has really good intentions,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 but it has slightly gone wrong as well.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 So I don't know if you guys know this, but on Twitter.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 Sweden has a, it's a country that has an official Twitter account.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 So it's @Sweden.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 And so you think, okay, who runs @Sweden?

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
 They made the decision that they're going to allow

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
 their own members of the public.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 Run it.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 One person at a time, one week at a time.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 So they just hand it over.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 And so the current person running it is called Isabel.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 This is her pin tweet.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 I don't do Fika.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000
 I don't do dating.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000
 I drink beer and fuck.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:28.000
 That is the official first tweet you see from Sweden.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 Did you see that as well that you can ring up Sweden?

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
 Has anyone seen this?

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 This is pretty cool, isn't it?

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
 Like they have a phone number and you can just call up

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
 and they just connect you to a random suite.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 Yeah.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 That sounds great.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 So someone's at home and their phone's ringing.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 Yeah.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 You just pick it up and...

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 You sign up for it.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 You sign up for this thing.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 And then someone from anywhere around the world at any time

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 can just ring you up and say hi.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 Is that Sweden?

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 And you say, yeah, I'm into fucking, you know?

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 Or whatever.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 I sign up for it if there was ring a British person.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
 Would you really dial a Brit?

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 Yeah.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 Because like in the office you don't really like talking to us.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 No, but you notice I constantly stare at my phone looking haunted and alone.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 So on politicians and social media, Jeremy Corbyn has been doing a big social media push

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 and has joined Snapchat.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 I see.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
 Which is what exactly, please.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 So I'm pretty sure.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 I think is it where people send naked photos themselves

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 so that people they're having a fairs with?

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 Yes.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 And then they...

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 I'm not sure that's exactly what Jeremy Corbyn will be doing with it.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 But yeah, it's that one where, yeah, the photo disappears.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 You probably all know that.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 So he's joined Snapchat.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 And he's posted a few photos.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
 Some of his first ones, a few of them were sideways.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
 And one of them was extremely blurry.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 And then most of them, it was of him, signing forms.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 But yeah, and he's also joined Instagram.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 And his first post was of a tonics t-cake.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
 It's very exciting actually.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 It's very exciting stuff going on in Jeremy Corbyn's social media company.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 No, it's good to see them embracing it.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 I think it's really cool.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 But yeah, they do get it spectacularly wrong sometimes.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 On Twitter, there was...

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 I thought this was great.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 There was a Dutch politician.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 This was back in 2011.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 I apologise for the rudeness of this in advance.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 But he was sending a text, which he thought he was sending to a lover.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 And he accidentally tweeted it.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 And the...

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 Yeah.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.000
 The @bigbadball.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 So the translation of the tweet roughly goes as you throbbingly climax

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000
 for the first time I feel in my mouth

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 as if they were the nectar of love.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 Right?

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 He didn't lose his job off the tweet.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
 But he did gain 20 new followers.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 So sometimes it works in their favour.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 Just some basic facts about this kind of thing.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp and that kind of thing is so popular now.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 A lot more than any other kind of ways of communicating.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.000
 So there are 60 billion messages every day through some kind of Messenger.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 And that's first is 23 billion by text message.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 And that means in two days there are more messages sent than humans have ever been alive.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 Whoa.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 Oh, God.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000
 Yeah.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 It's absolutely massive in Brazil as well, isn't it?

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 That's why this is happening.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 So I think the Brazilian sent twice...

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 Use WhatsApp on...

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 What?

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000
 I'm just going to...

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 None of these words are familiar to me before today.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 I'm really sorry.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 Which you called it snappity chat.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 Residians.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 Use social media even more than I do.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000
 No, they spend twice as much time on social media as Americans.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 Which I would have thought is going over 100% of the time that you're alive.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 In China as well, ginormous.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
 So they have a version of Twitter out there which is called Sino Weibu.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 It's ginormous.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
 Stephen Hawking joined it just a couple of days ago.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 We got two million followers in 24 hours.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 Like that's just how quickly and what a massive group you can get.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 But he had two million and 20 after he accidentally...

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 Well, he is sending his tweets in Chinese.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 And apparently just from the reports I'm reading that people are saying...

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 I have no idea what he's saying.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 It's in Chinese but I have no idea what he's saying.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 But I'd like to just say thanks for being on here.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 So they kind of really appreciate the fact that such a cool guy's on there.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
 Despite the fact he's making no sense of those tweets.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 There is a Chinese...

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 I think it's a Chinese instant messaging app.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 And I think it's a dating app.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 I'm going off memory here so I'm not sure on the details.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 But if you send a message which says something like,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 "Do you want to get a room?"

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000
 Or something like that.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 If you put in particular characters, it flashes up with a warning saying,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 "You're sure about that."

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 That's amazing.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 If only you're a throbbingly nexoman.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 What about that?

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
 So about presidents and stuff like this.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 So President Obama is the only person outside HBO

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 who's going to watch Game of Thrones before it goes on air.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 Okay.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000
 Now we know his real agenda.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 And there was a journalist who was called Vanessa Golembefsky

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 who thought, "If the president has a file of Game of Thrones,

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 then surely I can get that file through freedom of information."

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 And so she's going to President Obama saying,

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000
 "I want this file through freedom of information."

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 And they're going to see if they can get it.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 But the only problem is that the average amount of time to get a file

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 is 121 days.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 And by that time, we'll have already seen it by about two months.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 It's the principal.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 It's the principal, exactly.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.000
 But it's a nice idea, isn't it?

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 Just some world leaders I was reading today that Vladimir Putin

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 did a Q&A, a sort of big wide Q&A where anyone could ask questions.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 And I looked through the Q&A, they translated it into English.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 And my favorite question was from a 12-year-old girl who asked him

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 who he would save if these people were drowning,

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 the Turkish president or the Ukrainian leader.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 Who would you save if that was the situation?

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
 12-year-old girl.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 And Putin said, "If someone has decided to drown,

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
 it's probably already impossible to save them anyway."

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 He did say, "Oh, but we would lend a helping hand to whoever's in need."

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 But that was his first response.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 Okay, it is tied for fact number three.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
 And that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 My fact is that a German city is fighting global terror

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 by banning number plates starting with IS.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 Every little health.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 Yeah, absolutely.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
 As a city of Marburg in Germany,

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 and if you want to get a special license plate,

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 what's it called? Like a one-off?

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
 Personalized license plate.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 With IS and start, you will no longer be allowed to do that.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 So you'll have to leave Marburg, get it done somewhere else

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 where it's legal and they go back to Marburg.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 That will cost you petrol and it slows down.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 I didn't realise that license plates are so strict.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 So the DVLA is extremely strict about the license plates that can go out.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 And so they have a meeting every six months, I think,

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 where they go through and work out all the possible combinations

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 that could be construed as rude.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 And so that sounds like a great job, doesn't it?

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 So far.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 So much imagination required.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
 A lot of them I couldn't quite work out why they would be rude.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 So it's a 49-page document, the latest one, and it is very good reading.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000
 None of it is appropriate for tonight.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000
 For instance, there are two letter combinations that are banned.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 Two of the two letter combinations are MN and NF,

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 and I have no idea why they're rude.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.000
 Naughty, naughty-fisting.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.000
 Could you tell me a kind of fisting that isn't naughty?

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 There's a sense.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 I'm just doing a survey.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 But yeah, they go through and they list all the two letter combinations

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 that are banned, all the three letters that are banned.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000
 So you're not allowed on any number plates.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 C-U-M, C-O-K.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000
 I think I'm allowed to say all of this because I'm just spelling it out.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 C-N-T, N-T.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.000
 You're an upset because you're not a car.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 Always shattering my dreams, Andy.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 BNP, yeah, I think that's a real stab in the face.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 It's a political party that's not even allowed on number plates.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 So I wonder if instead of naughty-fisting, it's national front.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.000
 Could be the national front.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 I think it's naughty-fisting, though.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000
 But there are some which really sort of...

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:18.000
 You can't have V-A-6-1-A-N-A because it looks a bit like vagina, right?

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000
 But to me, that looks like vagianna.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 So it's a very odd sort of the rules of really...

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 You're not allowed to have A-11-N-O-B, all knob.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000
 Which, if you get that number plate, is an accurate description of what you are.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000
 A lot of these aren't personalised, though.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 So don't hold it against that.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000
 A lot of these are number plates that would be in the standard rotation

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 but they have to specifically remove them, like M-A-5-5-T-B-T.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 You see, it takes a lot of thought, yeah.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.000
 See if you can work out this one.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 Wait, hang on a... I didn't get that one.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 Hi, hon, let me show it to you.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000
 That's very rude.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 Alright, I've got... See if you can work out this one.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 X-351-ARO.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000
 Oh, this is great radio.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 And if you're playing a log at home, you can write it down.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 So that is, look at it backwards in mirror writing, and it spells out...

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000
 Is it oral sex?

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000
 It's because if you're looking backwards in your car, yeah.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 Yeah, they have to test that. They have to test the mirror writing.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 Smart.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 Although the R would be backwards, so it would be like Russian YAH.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000
 Have you guys heard...

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 James is super fun to have a road trip with, by the way.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000
 There's a new app that's out, which seems quite an exciting idea.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000
 It's called Plexed, and the idea is that when you're driving, you need to have...

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 So you need to hope this person has the app as well.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 But you can text their license plate, and the text gets through to them.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000
 So if someone's driving in front of you, and this is what they kind of think it's made for.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000
 It's like someone's driving in front of you, and they're doing a really good job.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000
 Why didn't you text them?

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 But you're a little out of text while driving.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
 I know, I don't know how the system works, but that's what it's meant to be.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000
 It's meant to be allowing you to communicate with other drivers to tell them good things about their driving.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000
 I think that's entrapment, legally, isn't it?

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.000
 Is it?

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000
 Isn't that when you persuade someone to do a crime, and then you convict them of that crime?

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 Well, when they...

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 And places on the Catholic Eater Jones film.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 When they finish their...

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 But they'll finish their journey, and then they'll safely retrieve their phone from the glove compartment,

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 where we all put it when we drive.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 And then they'll turn it on, and then they'll get the message saying good job, maybe.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 Some comedy about ISIS?

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000
 Yes.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000
 That's why everyone came tonight.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 So in the news this week, there was a guy called Franco Roberty, who is Italy's top prosecutor,

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:53.000
 and he says that Stoners, who are trying to get Marijuana legalised, are helping the fights against ISIS.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000
 Really?

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.000
 No.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.000
 Oh, sorry.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000
 How quickly the stone is turned in.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 Whatever, yes.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 Whatever.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000
 Okay.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:13.000
 The idea is that the Italian mafia and ISIS are working together to kind of bring Marijuana over from North Africa into Italy.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000
 And they reckon if it was legal, then they wouldn't have that way of making money.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000
 Wow.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.000
 It's good, isn't it?

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:25.000
 So on the subject of ISIS, I don't know if there are any archer fans in the room, but everyone should be on.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000
 Yeah.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000
 One of the radio for the archers.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000
 Not the archers.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.000
 Archers, the car, oh my god, I've just lost everyone.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000
 So in archer this TV series, it's about...

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000
 Alright, hang on, hang on, but quickly the archers.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000
 It's about the stone.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000
 The stone just is cheering at everything.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
 He doesn't know what's going on.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.000
 So...

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.000
 Baked out of his gall in the front row.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 You've read those words in a book, actually.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 Drug language of the streets, fifth edition.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000
 Is this ever going to...

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000
 Am I in archer?

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000
 The main character archer and all his colleagues work for a company called ISIS.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 It's a bunch of spires called ISIS.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:23.000
 And in 2014, when things started kicking off a little bit elsewhere, then the program makers decided they had to change the name.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000
 So ISIS, as everyone who watched his archer all know, has been removed from archer.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 And actually there was quite a good episode at the beginning of the series.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.000
 I think it was the first episode of series five or six where you saw in the background as Mallory was on the phone to archer.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.000
 You saw in the background two trucks with ISIS's logo disappearing into the sunset.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:46.000
 But this created a series problem because it's a really popular show and they had shed loads of merchandise.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:52.000
 So they just shipped it off to Syria.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 The creator Adam Reid said that in a board meeting, he suggested this jokolim was met with an ISIS silence.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:05.000
 So he should have been here and said, but he also said that he complained that I gave my dad one of the ISIS hats.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:11.000
 And in the end, he had to call me and say, "You know son, I'm not going to be able to wear that hat anymore.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:16.000
 I'm getting some weird looks in the hardware store."

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:24.000
 So I have a list of places which have had to change the name, which were called ISIS and have decided that it's not worth it anymore.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:38.000
 So there's a mobile banking app. There's a nail salon in Oakland, California, a Danish pudding company, a Belgian chocolate firm, and a wife swapping club in Leeds.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 And presumably they were just getting too much confusion from people.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 People go there and engage in all sorts of fun and frolics and they say it's not worth the aggro.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 So there was the nail salon in Oakland. They changed their name because people were genuinely making rude comments and rude phone calls saying, "I can't believe you guys, you're sick of us."

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 And they got some good feedback though because one person sent wrote an online review of, I remind you, a nail salon in California saying, "In the last week, ISIS gave me a real nice treatment.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 I don't know why we are bombing them."

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:21.000
 Okay. It is time for our final fact of the show and that is my fact.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:28.000
 My fact this week is that the North Pole is on a head-on collision course with Greenwich London.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000
 Where we are right now.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000
 This has just happened 20 years ago.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 But we've just noticed. It's been going one way. It's been heading towards Canada, the North Pole.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:45.000
 And mysteriously, they have no idea why. It's suddenly just flipped. Not a complete flip, but it's changed direction.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.000
 And it is now headed along Greenwich, Meridian. So it is heading right here where we are right now.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 We could be the North Pole in about a lot of millions of years.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000
 You know they do know why.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000
 Do they? Have we worked on that?

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 That's what they've discovered this week.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000
 I should have read the article.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 So to be clear, this isn't the Magnetic North Pole, which also moves quite a bit. This is the geographic North Pole.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:15.000
 So this is just the earth wobbles on its axis because it's not a perfect sphere.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000
 It's not kind of lumps and bumps on it and it's got different masses in different places.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:27.000
 So if you imagine sort of spinning a sphere round, then it's like a basketball and you're kind of spinning it on your finger.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:32.000
 And your finger is where the South Pole would be and then directly above it is where the North Pole would be.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.000
 It's exactly like that. And thank you very much for the metaphor James, similarly.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 And what's happened is they thought at first the reason it was moving was because of the Greenland ice caps melting.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 But actually they've been doing this study since 2005 and they've realised that what it is is a water loss from Eurasia,

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:59.000
 Bizarre, which sort of changes the masses in the earth. So a huge mass of water has been lost from India and from Asia.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:05.000
 And that's just changed the sort of weighting and the lumps and bumps in the earth and it's caused the earth to start spinning it differently,

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000
 start pivoting differently and it's gradually creeping towards us.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 But it has happened very suddenly, hasn't it?

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 We should say the speed at which it's moving, which is 17 centimetres a year, which is about the same as hair growth.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 Yeah, the funny thing about that is because I remember reading a good few years ago that Russia found the geographical North Pole and put a pole in there at the bottom of the ocean and put a Russian flag on it,

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:37.000
 because the geographic North Pole was kind of disputed between Canada, Denmark, I think, and Russia.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 And Russia wanted to say no it's ours and they put a flag there, but it's not there anymore.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:46.000
 It's like 17 centimetres away from it. But still not exactly where they said it was.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000
 Are they going to send someone to think all the way there to move it?

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:55.000
 Yeah, maybe, although it's down at the bottom of a very, very cold ocean, so I think maybe not.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 I discovered a fact this week, which I think is really, really interesting, which is in 1985.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000
 Did you guys know this? Neil Armstrong went to the North Pole.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 Did he?

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 Yeah, did you go in the sense that the Queen went to the moon?

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 No, because the Queen went, but with a letter from Neil, which he allowed.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 No, Neil Armstrong went to the North Pole with Edmund Hillary.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000
 So the first man to reach the top of Everest went with the first man to stand on the moon.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000
 And with Steve Fossett, who was the first person to go around the Earth.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000
 How do we not know this?

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000
 I know, isn't that really odd? So they flew there. They didn't actually do the track.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:35.000
 They flew there and they landed and they went to the Pole and it was with Edmund Hillary's son as well, who's also a big explorer.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:40.000
 And then on their way back, they were staying in a hut, which was still in icy conditions.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 And the storms around them, the icy storms were so great that they got stuck in the hut for a number of days.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:53.000
 And all they could do was chat. And apparently it was the first time ever that Neil Armstrong completely opened up about his experience on the moon.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000
 He'd never done that before to anyone.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:03.000
 And so Peter Hillary, who's the son of Edmund Hillary, has the total scoop on what was said because no one else is alive who was there in that room.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 And what happened?

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:11.000
 He says, all right, he just said, you know, he said left a letter and he went back.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 No, but isn't that amazing Neil Armstrong? And the person who organised it wanted to bring the people who'd done first to the place on Earth where they'd never been before.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.000
 Oh, okay, so it wasn't a big coincidence. They didn't get there.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000
 Well, you went to the moon. Are you serious?

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000
 I went, okay.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000
 No, they had the North Pole marathon this week.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000
 Oh, yes.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:37.000
 Yeah, it was won by a man from Arkansas and he ran the race in five hours, 17 minutes.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:46.000
 But the record is three hours, 36 minutes. And the reason is because it really, really matters on the conditions.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:52.000
 Like, it's not like the London marathon where you've got a bit of rain or something that makes a difference. It makes a massive difference.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.000
 They call it the coolest marathon in the world.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000
 Yeah.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:02.000
 And they have pole about guards all along the route.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.000
 Wait, hang on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Are the guards? I see what you're saying here.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000
 It's people guarding against polar bears.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.000
 Shame.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 Because I would run faster.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:20.000
 I've looked into the marathon as well.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000
 The first one happened in 2002. It hasn't been going that long.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:30.000
 And it only had one participant who was also the organiser.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:36.000
 Yeah. And the entire course is floating on top of, obviously, on 14,000 feet of Arctic Ocean.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:42.000
 Interesting thing about the ice, which is that it might be the last time ever that people ever walk to the North Pole.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000
 Oh, it won't happen that often because the ice is melting. There's not much weight in water.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 And even if you are walking to the North Pole, the ice often moves southwards.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000
 So you can be walking for days and days and be further away than you were when you started.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000
 Oh, wow.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.000
 Oh, my God.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.000
 So, yeah, I read there was a guy called Wally Herbert and he was trying to...

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000
 Wally Herbert.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 That's two words, meaning a bit of a dip.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.000
 Really?

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.000
 Yeah.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.000
 Well, he was an amazing explorer.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:17.000
 So he was trying to prove, because there was a lot of dispute about whether a not Peary was the first person.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000
 So he was trying to recreate the trip and see if he'd made it there.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.000
 So the idea is that Robert Peary claimed to have walked over the North Pole

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000
 and that people kind of not show whether he did or not.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.000
 Yeah, they weren't sure.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.000
 So he tried to recreate it.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.000
 His conclusion was that Peary didn't do it, that he did in fact, Dr. The Books.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.000
 But in doing so, Wally Herbert became the first person to do it.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.000
 So you obviously have to use compasses and work out where the North Pole was

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000
 and because of the shift that's going on all the time, it's hard to tell.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000
 So they did this marathon track this one day and they got to this point

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000
 where they thought let's stop and let's see where it is.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 And they realized they'd walked past it.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000
 They got to it, kept walking, didn't bother to check.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000
 So suddenly they were just like, oh my God, what are we going to do?

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.000
 Let's walk back.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000
 And Wally Herbert said, no, let's not walk back.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.000
 Let's go to sleep.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.000
 They went to sleep and because of the way that it was shifting in the morning,

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000
 they were back at the spot where the North Pole was.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.000
 Oh, really?

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000
 Because they worked out the hours of the shift that would happen.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000
 So he slept his way to the North Pole.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000
 Don't say it like that.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000
 It's not like a bisarival.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:26.000
 Okay, that's it.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.000
 That's all of our facts.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.000
 See you next week.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.000
 Goodbye.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000
