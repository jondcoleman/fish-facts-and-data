00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,640
 Hi everyone, before we start this week's episode

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,040
 of No Such Things as Fish,

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,080
 I just wanted to quickly remind you

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,760
 about our super special members area known by us

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,880
 and everyone who sees the name as Club Fish.

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,840
 It's a wonderful place where you get loads

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,560
 of bonus content, you get all the episodes

9
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,040
 without any adverts.

10
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,300
 You'll be the first to hear about any live shows

11
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,120
 we're gonna do and we have a thing called a Discord.

12
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,200
 Now for the uninitiated, such as myself,

13
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,480
 a Discord is a place where you can go

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,480
 and chat all things fish with like-minded fish fans.

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,200
 It's a really cool place to be,

16
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,680
 loads of fellow listeners on there

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,980
 and you might even see the odd member

18
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,800
 of No Such Things as Fish popping up from time to time.

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,760
 And when I say the odd member, I mean Dan, of course.

20
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,240
 Like I always mean when I say the odd member.

21
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,800
 (laughs)

22
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,880
 Actually, while I'm here, I might as well remind you

23
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,040
 that Dan has a book out.

24
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,880
 It's called The Theory of Everything Else.

25
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,040
 It's absolutely amazing.

26
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:04,720
 It's basically all of Dan's brain printed in a book

27
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,480
 and what could be more enticing than that.

28
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,480
 Let's be honest.

29
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,320
 So go out and buy that and join Club Fish if you'd like

30
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,000
 and the place to join Club Fish

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,340
 is NoSuchThingAsAFish.com

32
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,200
 and all the information about how to subscribe to Club Fish

33
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,400
 through Apple Podcasts or Patreon is there.

34
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,280
 Okay, on with the podcast.

35
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,860
 (upbeat music)

36
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,140
 (phone ringing)

37
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,820
 (speaking in foreign language)

38
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:41,360
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

39
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,160
 of No Such Thing As A Fish, a weekly podcast.

40
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,340
 This week coming to you live from Cardiff.

41
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:51,340
 (audience cheering)

42
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:56,280
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

43
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,940
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski and Drew Hunter Murray

44
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,140
 and James Harkin.

45
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,820
 And once again, we have gathered round the microphones

46
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:07,060
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

47
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,460
 And in a particular order, here we go.

48
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:14,260
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Anna.

49
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,580
 - My fact this week is that croissant shaped croissants

50
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,500
 taste worse than non-croissant shaped croissants.

51
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,500
 (audience laughing)

52
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,340
 - Croissant?

53
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,160
 - That's a pretty hard sentence to say.

54
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,760
 - It feels more like a complaint to waitros than a fact.

55
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,000
 (audience laughing)

56
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,460
 - It's actually, it's more of a complaint

57
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,900
 to the country of France.

58
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,280
 (audience laughing)

59
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,580
 - When you say croissant shaped croissant,

60
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,720
 you mean like a crescent shaped croissant.

61
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,040
 - Exactly.

62
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,640
 - You're classic croissant.

63
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,720
 - A classic croissant.

64
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,360
 - Well, it's not actually a classic,

65
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,720
 but it is, the name obviously croissant comes from the fact

66
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,600
 that it is, you know, in the old school sense,

67
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,960
 crescent shaped, curved, but.

68
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,200
 - Why is it not classic?

69
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,760
 - Well, just because today, so many of them are straight,

70
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,240
 and I couldn't believe.

71
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,860
 - You can't redesign the classic, that's the classic.

72
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,200
 That's what that word means.

73
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,500
 - They've updated the classic.

74
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,440
 It's a modern classic.

75
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,040
 - Modern classic, yeah.

76
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,880
 - The modern classic is a straight croissant,

77
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,880
 and they taste nicer.

78
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,720
 Facts.

79
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,060
 (audience laughing)

80
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,600
 - Surely they're just a different shape,

81
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,080
 so how can they taste different?

82
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,460
 - Ah, so glad you asked.

83
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,880
 - Almost like I know the answer.

84
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,500
 - You'll probably know this if you are French,

85
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,960
 or if you work in a pÃ¢tisserie,

86
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:31,360
 but basically, you know, if like straight croissants,

87
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,600
 so they're fat in the middle and thin on the outsides,

88
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,480
 but they go in a straight line,

89
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,600
 they are all butter croissants, okay?

90
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,720
 But curved ones, in that little C crescent shaped,

91
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,320
 croissant shape, they can actually just be made

92
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,600
 with oil or margarine, which as everyone knows,

93
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,640
 tastes inferior.

94
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,520
 - But interestingly, a lot of French people

95
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,480
 prefer the margarine one,

96
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,780
 'cause apparently it dunks better in coffee.

97
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,100
 - Yeah, there are claims about this.

98
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,580
 I feel like that's people trying to be contrary,

99
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,300
 'cause let's face it, all butter croissants,

100
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,540
 they're more expensive, they're more luxurious.

101
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,340
 In France, you know, the adults would get

102
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,020
 the straight croissants, and they'd give their kids

103
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,620
 the shitty, cheaper, curved croissants,

104
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,940
 'cause they're made with margarine, I read that somewhere,

105
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,220
 and I think this is mad.

106
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,300
 There are some claims that it's actually by law

107
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,340
 that margarine croissants are not allowed to be straight,

108
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,820
 but I can't find that law anywhere,

109
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,800
 but it certainly is practice across France.

110
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,800
 - Somewhere in the French parliament,

111
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,000
 they will have a croissant division

112
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,720
 who are looking into croissant-related legislation.

113
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,400
 - But it's not the butter that turns the croissant

114
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,240
 into a crescent.

115
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,760
 - Right, the butter doesn't do anything.

116
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,440
 There's nothing that's happening chemically here.

117
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,400
 It's just in practice.

118
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,040
 Just the rule is, if you work in a boulangerie,

119
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,760
 if it's all butter croissants, it's straight.

120
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,440
 And if you want to make an all butter croissant curved,

121
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,680
 you can, but if you want to make a margarine croissant

122
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,420
 straight, you're going to prison.

123
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,940
 (laughing)

124
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,820
 - But fortunately, in French prison,

125
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,840
 the wine selection is very good,

126
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,780
 and you'll actually have a nice time.

127
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,140
 So there was a coup in 2016, and this is in the UK,

128
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,420
 a croissant-related coup, which is Tesco replaced

129
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:09,860
 all of its curved croissants with straight croissants,

130
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,860
 and they did it, as in they just announced it,

131
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,220
 and they said right from tomorrow,

132
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,100
 they gave people no notice or warning.

133
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,180
 (laughing)

134
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,860
 - 'Cause you might've gone in and just bought

135
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,260
 the entire stock, right, New?

136
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,160
 - Well, you can't stock up, can you,

137
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,680
 'cause you have to buy them fresh every day.

138
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,480
 So they knew that their customers

139
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,680
 would be snooker the next day, but they just said,

140
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,120
 they claimed, okay, they made this claim,

141
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,080
 which I think is bizarre, they claimed it was due

142
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,280
 to the spreadability factor that they were,

143
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,200
 they were actually making life easier for their customers.

144
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,640
 They said, if you cut open a straight croissant,

145
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,960
 it's very easy to put in your jam or whatever.

146
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,840
 Obviously, if you cut open a curved croissant,

147
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,680
 it's a nightmare, and it takes hours, blah, blah, blah.

148
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,480
 - I, do you know, people took the piss at the time,

149
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,880
 and it was the boss of Tesco, Harry Jones, who said this,

150
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,820
 but I genuinely agree with him.

151
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,820
 He said, when the croissants curved,

152
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,720
 people can take up to three attempts

153
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,220
 to achieve perfect coverage, which increases,

154
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,260
 increases the potential for accidents

155
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,260
 involving sticky fingers and tables.

156
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,380
 But honestly, it is harder to spread a curved croissant.

157
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,300
 - So I wanna, I want to, and I can't,

158
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,860
 because he's not here, and I don't know him,

159
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,980
 pick him up on that sentence.

160
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:14,980
 Sticky fingers causes accidents and other problems.

161
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,420
 What the fuck is he talking about?

162
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,040
 (laughing)

163
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,960
 - What on earth is that sentence?

164
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,920
 And he said 75% of people who were surveyed

165
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,640
 wanted the straighter croissant because of,

166
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,080
 as Andy says, the spreadability factor.

167
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,360
 - Am I the only one who doesn't cut open a croissant

168
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,680
 and spread jam in it?

169
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,520
 - No, I don't.

170
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,820
 - I just find that so weird, and the other interesting

171
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,120
 thing about croissants is, in that kind of respect,

172
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,800
 is, you know the idea that, especially when you go to France,

173
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,080
 you see them, and they're cut in half,

174
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,240
 and they put like ham and cheese and stuff in the middle.

175
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,700
 - Oh, that's here as well, yeah.

176
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,500
 - But that was only invented in the 1970s.

177
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,340
 - Wow.

178
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,180
 - You know that?

179
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,020
 So the French, they decided to do this

180
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,220
 because they were worried that American hamburgers

181
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,980
 were coming over to France, and they thought,

182
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,500
 what can we do to stop--

183
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,580
 (laughing)

184
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,300
 Holy, the march of the hamburger, I know what we can do.

185
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,460
 We can put ham and cheese inside our croissants.

186
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,580
 - That's the French hamburger, I didn't know that.

187
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,000
 - There were these places called croissanteries

188
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,100
 across France, and they were created in the 1970s

189
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,740
 as a big government, like, status intervention

190
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,320
 in the market to deal with the scourge

191
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,060
 of what they call le fast food.

192
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,400
 - Yeah, yeah.

193
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,080
 - I just can't imagine ever anyone's like,

194
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,720
 oh, it's 1 a.m., God, it's McDonald's open.

195
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,720
 No, but the croissanteries are fantastic.

196
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,680
 - I stayed in a four-star all-inclusive recently.

197
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,520
 - Woo!

198
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,040
 - Bloody hell, Dan.

199
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,000
 - Yeah, and it was really interesting.

200
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,880
 They had this bit of new technology I've seen nowhere before,

201
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,960
 which is, during the breakfast buffet, they had croissants,

202
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,320
 and you would select your croissant,

203
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,700
 of which there was almond, and just classic plain,

204
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,460
 and chocolate, you get a plain one,

205
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,300
 and then they had all these pipes coming out,

206
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,420
 kind of like if you were pouring a pint, right?

207
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:54,020
 There was like seven of these pint-pulling things,

208
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,180
 and what they did is they take your croissant over,

209
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,060
 and one dispenses chocolate, one does jam, and so on,

210
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,340
 and what they do is they shove the croissant into the pipe,

211
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:05,660
 and then they pump it full of chocolate, or jam, or whatever.

212
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,500
 Oh my good, it was like seeing the future.

213
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,220
 I couldn't believe it.

214
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,940
 They came back, and I was like, in Italy,

215
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,740
 they've got the future in the four-star-inclusives,

216
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,580
 it's amazing.

217
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,160
 I was really thinking when he launched on this story,

218
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,240
 I think I know more about breakfast buffet technology

219
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,720
 than Dan does, and I didn't.

220
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,360
 I'm stunned.

221
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,240
 You need to know where that is now, don't you, Andy,

222
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,520
 'cause you are a bit of an expert on breakfast buffets.

223
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,800
 The last all-inclusive I went to on the breakfast buffet,

224
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,800
 they had Haribo's, and I must admit,

225
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,000
 I did not eat a single croissant that week.

226
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,040
 The French, of course, should actually put Haribo

227
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,600
 on their croissants.

228
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,400
 One thing about croissants that's really interesting

229
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,040
 is that they're quite new, right?

230
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,980
 So the oldest recipe, as far as I could find,

231
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,100
 which is of a traditional classic,

232
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,740
 or even modern classic, croissant, is from 1906.

233
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,940
 And so that means that Napoleon didn't eat croissants,

234
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,940
 Bolzac, Victor Hugo, Georges Sainte,

235
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,980
 they never ate a croissant in their life.

236
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:57,820
 Wow.

237
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,540
 Maybe that's why they were so productive.

238
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,780
 Maybe the croissants led to the downfall of France.

239
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:06,580
 Did you guys hear about Operation Croissant?

240
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,420
 No.

241
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,500
 Operation Croissant was something

242
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,940
 that was launched in 2016.

243
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:13,360
 It was an Anglo-French operation.

244
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,600
 It was the day before the Brexit vote,

245
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,680
 and a campaign group tried to campaign on Brexit

246
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,920
 with Operation Croissant, which was giving out croissants

247
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,440
 accompanied by pro-EU messages written by people in France

248
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,960
 on postcards saying, please, you know, don't leave.

249
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,280
 And the croissants get this,

250
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,160
 they had been baked that morning, the 22nd of June,

251
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,320
 and they come to London on the first Euro star of the day,

252
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,400
 and there were 600 croissants, which would be on there.

253
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,760
 That's a lot of effort for something

254
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,460
 that ended up being completely fucking useless, isn't it?

255
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,940
 It's very romantic, though, and very French,

256
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,980
 and they had 600 croissants ready to give out,

257
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,540
 and then the police interceded.

258
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,740
 The police stopped them and said it's illegal

259
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,460
 to use food, drink, or entertainment to influence a vote.

260
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,300
 Oh, it is, yeah.

261
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,500
 And so they were all imprisoned, actually,

262
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,100
 for, there's some of them are still in.

263
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,100
 No, they issued a statement saying,

264
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,940
 we are happy to fall on our baguettes

265
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,180
 and stick to the right side of British law.

266
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:13,180
 Have you guys heard this is an America of the Cronut?

267
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,780
 Yeah. Yeah.

268
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,460
 Am I the only one who hasn't heard of the Cronut?

269
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,460
 I think it might be.

270
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,580
 Oh, okay.

271
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:22,580
 Have you guys heard of the Croffin?

272
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,580
 It's Croffin.

273
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,940
 Okay. No.

274
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:29,220
 Do you know, I reckon, between us, even if we haven't,

275
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,500
 I reckon we can put it together.

276
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,340
 Go on then.

277
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,100
 It's a Cronut full of stuffing, isn't it?

278
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,060
 Yeah. Yeah.

279
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,420
 It's a Christmas, it's a Christmas crustal,

280
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,380
 full of stuff, yeah.

281
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,340
 So anyway, you guys must have facts.

282
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,340
 No, no, this is...

283
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,420
 Hey, Dan, have you heard of the Cromosa?

284
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:47,180
 Cromosa.

285
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,860
 Someone gasped then, as if this is the greatest thing

286
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,980
 they've ever heard.

287
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:54,300
 Basically, a croissant with Samosa filling and then deep-fried.

288
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,980
 Oh, lovely. Yeah.

289
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:00,300
 Have you heard of, if we're doing this, which I think we are,

290
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,500
 a Kregel?

291
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,180
 A Kregel. Okay.

292
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,980
 Yep. Yep.

293
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,220
 That's a croissant and a bagel?

294
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,500
 Anyone like to take the next one?

295
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,100
 Oh, have you heard of one? I'll go for one.

296
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,500
 A townie.

297
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,420
 A townie. It's not very politically correct, James.

298
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,980
 There are no croissants involved.

299
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:14,900
 What is it?

300
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,140
 It's a half tart, half brownie.

301
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,660
 Oh!

302
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,300
 And finally, one more, a doughnut.

303
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,380
 You know what that is?

304
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,260
 A pug, a pug and a doughnut.

305
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,900
 A pug that's been turned into a doughnut.

306
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,340
 Yes!

307
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,860
 It's not so far off.

308
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,220
 It's a doughnut crossed with a chicken nugget.

309
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,060
 Ah!

310
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,980
 Which is basically just a doughnut-shaped chicken nugget.

311
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,140
 Wow.

312
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,740
 It still tastes the same.

313
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,260
 The cronut, an interesting thing about the cronut,

314
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,500
 is that this was made in 2013, and it was in America.

315
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,700
 And it was a bakery guy who wanted to do a doughnut

316
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:53,140
 meets the croissant, and it took off massively straight away.

317
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,820
 So he released it on one day.

318
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,860
 The next day, there was a queue of 100 people

319
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,300
 trying to get access to the cronut.

320
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,300
 And the market value, the black market value

321
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,740
 of the cronut immediately was massive.

322
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:08,140
 So you would buy it for something like $2 or $3, $4 or $5, right?

323
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,940
 It was selling for like $100.

324
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,540
 There were people in alleyways.

325
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,460
 Yeah, it was such hot property.

326
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,300
 In alleyways.

327
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,140
 In alleyways in New York.

328
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,740
 You wouldn't buy a pastry in an alleyway.

329
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,860
 You would if it was a cronut.

330
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,820
 Because cronuts were, they were so popular.

331
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,620
 And so, it was a guy called Dominique Ansel,

332
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,260
 who was the creator of the cronut,

333
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,060
 and it was so popular that he trademarked it.

334
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,300
 So he owns it. No one else can make a cronut.

335
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,420
 They can. They just don't call it a cronut.

336
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,700
 Well, no, there's the doissant, which you can get.

337
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,100
 But you can't get the original.

338
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,140
 And so, yeah, but there was a huge black market value for it.

339
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:43,100
 God, people are stupid, aren't they?

340
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,780
 We should say, just because otherwise people

341
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:47,660
 are going to write in that, and I never thought I'd say this,

342
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:50,420
 James turns out to be the most sophisticated of the four of us

343
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:53,260
 in this one metric, because in France,

344
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:56,580
 they never put filling into their croissants.

345
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,940
 Which I didn't actually realise.

346
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,980
 But all Frenchers seem to concur on this.

347
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,140
 They say that they've literally never in their whole life

348
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:06,380
 met someone from France who puts jam or butter even worse

349
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,380
 on their croissants.

350
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,620
 Because it's got all the butter in it already.

351
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,820
 But it's only half butter.

352
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,060
 But people, it doesn't taste the same as when you melt

353
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,980
 the new layer of butter into it.

354
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,500
 I've got no patience with people who say

355
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,500
 there's enough butter in croissants already.

356
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,940
 You can never have enough butter.

357
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,060
 Do you know the Concorde du Mayor croissant de Grand Paris?

358
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,500
 This is the French croissant championships.

359
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,500
 Did you go for a French shirt?

360
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,620
 Sorry, I didn't mean to.

361
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,620
 I didn't mean to.

362
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,180
 But it's the most French thing you can imagine.

363
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:38,220
 So it's the greater Paris best class on competition, basically.

364
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,100
 And there was a brilliant National Geographic piece about it.

365
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,340
 The judge's comments are just so French.

366
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,340
 So listen to this one.

367
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,140
 "It's executed to perfection.

368
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,780
 "If Marie Antoinette had offered these to the French people,

369
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,820
 "there probably wouldn't have been a revolution."

370
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:56,940
 He also says at the beginning,

371
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,500
 "It's executed to perfection."

372
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,500
 Which...

373
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,100
 LAUGHTER

374
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:10,980
 It is time for fact number two, and that is James.

375
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:14,500
 OK, my fact this week is that Manchester City women's football

376
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,100
 team has a menstrual cycle coach.

377
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,100
 No.

378
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,620
 Is that a cycling coach who is also menstrual?

379
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,020
 LAUGHTER

380
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,300
 Or is it...?

381
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:29,180
 No, it's a coach to get the best out of their players

382
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,940
 when they're on their periods.

383
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,740
 Or in fact, for all different parts of the month.

384
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,620
 So this was an article I read in The Economist,

385
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,380
 and they were talking about this in general,

386
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,780
 and then I found out that Man City have this.

387
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:42,180
 But basically, I mean, it really makes sense, right?

388
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,460
 So if you're an elite sports person,

389
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:47,060
 you're really always aiming for that extra, like, 1%

390
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,580
 that'll just make you better than anyone else.

391
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,620
 And a load of studies have been done,

392
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,020
 and more and more are being done,

393
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,780
 that show that women's performance fluctuates

394
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,940
 at different times of the month due to their cycle.

395
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,620
 And so it really makes sense that you have someone on your team

396
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,380
 who can get the most out of your players by working that out.

397
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:06,620
 Oh, so it's not like you'll be hauled off halfway through a match

398
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,420
 because the cycle coach has looked at their watch and said,

399
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,100
 "No, she's on. Get her off."

400
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,500
 I should hope not. No, OK.

401
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,940
 I'm really hope that doesn't happen.

402
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,340
 I don't think it works like that, either, OK.

403
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,540
 LAUGHTER

404
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:23,300
 I've seen those adverts just roller-skated along.

405
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,700
 LAUGHTER

406
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,860
 But this is the other thing that's really important,

407
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:32,180
 is that women footballers are way, way more likely

408
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,380
 to get certain injuries than male footballers, right?

409
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,100
 So there's a thing called the anterior cruciate ligament,

410
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,980
 and, like, football fans will know that this is something

411
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,660
 that plagues, like, male footballers,

412
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,820
 but it's really, really bad for women.

413
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,100
 And apparently women are eight times more likely

414
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,380
 to get an ACL injury than men.

415
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,460
 And a lot of people think that it's related to the menstrual cycle.

416
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,940
 So Arsenal midfielder Jordan Knobbs,

417
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:57,900
 she missed out of the 2019 World Cup because of her ACL,

418
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,860
 and she reckons it was because of the time of the month she was on,

419
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,100
 and that made her weaker.

420
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,180
 Yeah, apparently, basically, your menstrual cycle is split,

421
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,700
 not yours, but half of our menstrual cycles

422
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,660
 are split into essentially two phases,

423
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,140
 the follicular and the luteal phase.

424
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:15,580
 And in the late follicular phase,

425
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:18,340
 which I believe is week two, so you've had your period,

426
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,100
 and then it's kind of the week after that,

427
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,620
 that's when estrogen concentration is highest,

428
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,020
 and that's when you're just going to get injured,

429
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:26,900
 your bones are going to snap, your ligaments are going to break.

430
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:30,140
 You should basically stay in a padded room for a week,

431
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,500
 it turns out.

432
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,420
 Well, the thing is that estrogen is anabolic,

433
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,300
 so you'll know anabolic steroids that people take to build muscles,

434
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,220
 so estrogen helps muscle to build,

435
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,060
 so that's one difference that happens.

436
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,540
 But really what you do is you make sure that your diet

437
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,180
 is different at different times of the month.

438
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,420
 You can change your training so you can work harder

439
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,460
 at one time of the month and less harder at another time of the month,

440
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,620
 that's what they're kind of doing in city.

441
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:56,180
 I was also looking at other bits of sport science in women's football.

442
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,740
 I didn't realise the England women's team,

443
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:00,380
 they have personalised bra prescriptions.

444
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,660
 - Did they? - Yeah, they did this year.

445
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:05,140
 They got in a breast biomechanics expert or two

446
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,540
 to provide very, very personalised bras

447
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,940
 - to ensure that they got the right, literally, the support they needed. - Really?

448
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,260
 Do you have to go into a chemist and they say,

449
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,180
 "We'll just make that up for you every 10 minutes?"

450
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,140
 You've got a seamstress in the back.

451
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:21,580
 The Guardian covered it and they said, "If those cups could talk..."

452
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:24,260
 - Slightly creepy way of putting it. - LAUGHTER

453
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:27,380
 "They might claim a share of the lioness's victory for themselves."

454
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,580
 - Right. - But it genuinely makes a massive difference.

455
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:34,100
 And supposedly, if you run in a poorly-supportive bra,

456
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,060
 it can shorten a woman's stride by four centimetres.

457
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,260
 And that, and I'm going to need some help with this statistic,

458
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:42,460
 can add up to an extra mile over the length of a marathon.

459
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,180
 Now, that's what I read. I don't understand how...

460
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,900
 Does that mean when you get to everyone else's run 26 miles

461
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,540
 and you still have to do another mile?

462
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,420
 Well, that's what I don't understand.

463
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:53,700
 I think it means that you have to do more strides to do the marathon.

464
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,860
 - I see. - But I... Yeah.

465
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:59,020
 I don't think it means that you get to finish early.

466
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,620
 I like, with the lionesses, there's so many...

467
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,460
 Like, superstition is a big thing within footballers,

468
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,460
 where they have to follow certain routines.

469
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,940
 We see it in sports where, like, Serena Williams

470
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,380
 will wear the same pair of socks throughout a competition.

471
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,500
 If she plays Wimbledon, she'll wear the same pair of socks,

472
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,740
 just so it makes it sort of feel like she'll win, that sort of thing.

473
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:21,180
 With the lionesses, there's one player who always needs to have beans on toast.

474
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,620
 That's her thing. She thinks, "That's going to help me."

475
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:26,380
 - Okay. - It's just routine, and it's what they do.

476
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,260
 And then another thing was, there was one match

477
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:32,060
 where a few of them had a ponytail that was done by one of the players,

478
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,540
 and they had a great game.

479
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:36,380
 They started believing that this ponytail was part of the sort of...

480
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:39,140
 Who the hell needs someone else to do their ponytails?

481
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,340
 I've seen the ponytails of the England women's team.

482
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,380
 They're pretty basic ponytails.

483
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:47,140
 When the Euros were on earlier this year,

484
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:51,900
 the Guardian newspaper had biographies of all 368 players.

485
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,300
 - Okay. - So I read all of those.

486
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,020
 - Nice. - And I'll be honest,

487
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,100
 there wasn't that much in there.

488
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:03,420
 So Lena McGull, who plays for Germany, this is her fun fact.

489
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:08,700
 She was born exactly 225 days to the day after Napoleon Bonaparte.

490
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,540
 225 days?

491
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,380
 - Yes. - Yes.

492
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:15,780
 - She's very fit for her age. - She's very, very old.

493
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:21,100
 - Wow. - She will only have got croissants since the 1970s.

494
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:26,020
 She was 200 years older. She's like, "What is this?"

495
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:29,860
 Marie-Leon, let's see if I can get this one right. She's Spanish.

496
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:33,220
 She has lots of tattoos, but they're only on her left arm.

497
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,460
 Can you work out why they're only on her left arm?

498
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,460
 She right-handed, but she's a tattoo artist.

499
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:40,260
 - Correct. - Oh, wow!

500
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:44,100
 That's really good. And another one, Viviane May Diemer,

501
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,780
 who's from the Netherlands.

502
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,940
 She always got upset because people called her the goat.

503
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:51,220
 - So goat means greatest of all time. - Yeah.

504
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:54,900
 But she didn't know that's what it meant.

505
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,980
 And she just said, "A goat is not the best animal to be."

506
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,980
 Why are they calling me a goat?

507
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,940
 - That's so good. - I love that.

508
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:08,260
 So we mentioned ages and ages ago, there was a band, the English FA,

509
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,220
 they banned women's football in about 1920, didn't they?

510
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,420
 - 21, I think, yes. - They banned women from playing on their pictures,

511
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,740
 which effectively banned it.

512
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,260
 So it sort of shut down the game.

513
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,260
 But this happened all over Europe.

514
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,580
 So the French game was their football federation.

515
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,540
 They banned it in 1933.

516
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:25,100
 West Germany, 1955.

517
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,340
 Spain, 1930, to '75, it was banned.

518
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:31,020
 Or it was banned in the '20s and '30s,

519
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:35,260
 and then all the bans were lifted in about the very late '60s or early '70s.

520
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,380
 - Yeah. - Yeah. It's just very peculiar.

521
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,100
 Yeah, it is very weird.

522
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,020
 Although some sort of underground matches did happen,

523
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,700
 socially underground, not literally underground,

524
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,140
 in the interim.

525
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,820
 And I think there was...

526
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,540
 It was the early 1970s, as you say,

527
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,460
 that it started to come back into the mainstream again.

528
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:57,940
 And there was the Unofficial Women's World Cup in Italy in 1970.

529
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:01,260
 And I think FIFA refused to play a part in that, but it did happen.

530
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,300
 And it was quite popular.

531
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,980
 And then there was a follow-up in Mexico in '71.

532
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,580
 And it was really popular.

533
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:11,020
 So I had no idea. The final, in 1971, had a crowd of 110,000,

534
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,940
 which I think is the biggest women's crowd ever.

535
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,660
 And there have been claims made about similar crowds recently,

536
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,140
 but I think that's bigger than all of them.

537
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,420
 - Yeah, that's right. - Amazing.

538
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,980
 Yeah, and it was great.

539
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,740
 It was sponsored by Martini.

540
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:26,340
 So I guess you got free shots of fortified wine

541
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:29,180
 given out to you, the classic football drink.

542
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,780
 And to make it...

543
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:36,340
 Weirdly, to make it appeal more to the female audience, I guess,

544
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:39,620
 they painted the gold frames with pink and white

545
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:42,140
 and all the stadium stuff with pink outfits.

546
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,220
 No, there's an intake of breath,

547
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,420
 but I do think that pink gets a bad reputation

548
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:48,260
 because it's not an objectively bad colour.

549
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,660
 But, yeah.

550
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:53,620
 It feels like a bad colour for a football goal, though, right?

551
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,700
 A nice bright white is what you want.

552
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,620
 - That's probably the most contrast, isn't it? - Yeah.

553
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,500
 Better than painting it green.

554
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,500
 I read about what I think might be the earliest example

555
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,260
 of a woman playing football.

556
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,300
 It was this woman who was born just after Napalm.

557
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,820
 No, it wasn't.

558
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,500
 It was in 1773 in Yorkshire,

559
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,980
 and it was a match between the married gentlemen

560
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:18,180
 of the town of Walton and the bachelors of the town of Walton.

561
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,740
 And it said in the report, it said,

562
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:23,220
 "The game had many falls and broken shins on each side,

563
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,700
 "and at one stage, the wife of one of the married men

564
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,900
 "went to help him after he was injured.

565
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,340
 "She then went after the ball

566
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,940
 "and secured victory for her husband's team."

567
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,460
 Oh.

568
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:36,420
 It doesn't count, though, really, it's an illegal move, isn't it?

569
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:39,900
 - Kind of a random play, I don't know. - I'm stumbling from the ground.

570
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,180
 Women's football basically has, just until recently,

571
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:48,060
 had just terrible, even internally from the football community,

572
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,660
 particularly the officials, just terrible times.

573
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:55,540
 1991, FIFA didn't want to name the women's World Cup the World Cup.

574
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:59,820
 So instead, they got a sponsor, so it was the M&M's Cup.

575
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:03,020
 They could have named it after Mars bars and called it the Mars Cups.

576
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,460
 - You have the World Cup and the Mars Cup. - Oh, yeah!

577
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:08,580
 - And then they could have done an intergalactic match against each other. - Exactly.

578
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,900
 - Yeah, Solar Cup. - And those games, they made the games 10 minutes shorter.

579
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,820
 - Yeah. - Just in case the women collapsed

580
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,780
 when playing for the full 90 minutes.

581
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,500
 - Yeah, yeah. - That seems to be the reasoning.

582
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,260
 - That was 1991, right? - Yeah, yeah.

583
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:22,700
 And when West Germany listed its ban in 1970,

584
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,740
 the games were only 70 minutes long,

585
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:28,020
 and they were only allowed to be played in warm weather.

586
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,660
 - It's crazy. - Basically, just in case Cold Weather

587
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:34,700
 - killed the players. - Yeah, that seems to be the panic that there was.

588
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:40,420
 And Seth Blatter, who is the president of FIFA, right?

589
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,380
 He was asked about women's football, this was a while ago,

590
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,980
 - and he suggested that... - He was a very progressive man,

591
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:50,180
 so I'm looking forward to an extremely liberal and thoughtful comment here.

592
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:53,020
 I hope we're not going to tarnish the good name of Seth Blatter in this room.

593
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,380
 Really not!

594
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:59,100
 He said that he suggested to get more people watching women's football

595
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,740
 that female players should wear tighter shorts

596
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:05,100
 to promote a more female aesthetic.

597
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,660
 He said they could, for example, have tighter shorts.

598
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:12,580
 Female players are pretty, if you excuse me, for saying so.

599
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,700
 And they already have some different rules to men,

600
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,980
 such as playing with a lighter ball.

601
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,220
 They don't play with a lighter ball.

602
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,420
 You did used to be there, you used to be playing with kids' balls.

603
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,860
 In Japan, when they started playing women's football in the 80s,

604
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:26,220
 they played with a children's ball, I think,

605
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:29,540
 and the halves lasted 25 minutes,

606
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:34,540
 and handballs were permissible if it was players protecting their own breasts,

607
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,180
 which I actually think is a fine rule.

608
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:39,980
 I'm going to need to move us on in a second.

609
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,780
 I was looking at world records for Keepey Uppies.

610
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:43,780
 Oh, yeah.

611
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:47,700
 Because in 2003, there was a woman called Milen Dominguez,

612
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,660
 who's quite a famous-age footballer.

613
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:53,900
 She's the ex-wife of Ronaldo, not the Ronaldo that you would know, Andy,

614
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,580
 but the Ronaldo that football fans would know.

615
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:59,380
 Oh, it's so nice that you presume I know any of the Ronaldo's.

616
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,180
 I'm really, like, I'm quite proud of it.

617
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:07,420
 Anyway, she was 17 at the time, and she did 55,187 Keepey Uppies,

618
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,300
 which was a world record.

619
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,380
 Now, according to the Guinness Book of Records,

620
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,940
 the current world record was made in 2009.

621
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,260
 It was by a British guy called Dan Magnus,

622
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:19,940
 and he did 24 hours of Keepey Uppies in Covent Garden.

623
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,900
 He did over 200,000 touches.

624
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,900
 What?

625
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:26,420
 But he was allowed a few breaks to kind of stretch his legs

626
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,060
 and stretch his muscles and stuff,

627
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,900
 whereas Milen Dominguez didn't have any breaks.

628
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,500
 And whenever she needed to do anything,

629
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,540
 whenever she needed to eat, drink or go to the toilet,

630
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:38,460
 she did it by balancing the ball on the back of her neck

631
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,460
 and then backing up and sitting down and doing it.

632
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,420
 So I reckon she should still have the record.

633
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,420
 Oh, my God.

634
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,420
 That's amazing.

635
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,420
 I think I will just have a main, actually.

636
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,420
 I'm going to skip the starter.

637
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,420
 Thank you very much.

638
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,420
 Wow.

639
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:52,460
 And then there was a 12-year-old called Imogen Papwerth Heidel,

640
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:56,980
 who last year did 7.1 million Keepey Uppies.

641
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:57,980
 Sorry?

642
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:00,780
 But she had a lot of them donated by other people.

643
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:05,700
 So the idea was that she was going to do one for every key worker

644
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,420
 in the UK after, you know, COVID stuff.

645
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:12,220
 And she, in fairness, she did, like, over a million

646
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,900
 over a long period of time.

647
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:17,100
 But the rest were donated by Marcus Rashford, Lucy Bronze,

648
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,380
 and Spandau Balleig star, Martin Kemp.

649
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,380
 Oh, cool.

650
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,380
 Go, Martin.

651
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:26,380
 It's been a joy patch since he left his standards, hasn't it?

652
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:36,380
 It is time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

653
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:40,340
 My fact this week is that two of the leading archaeologists

654
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:43,340
 to dig up King Richard III's bones

655
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:46,220
 were called King and Richard.

656
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:48,220
 (LAUGHTER)

657
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:51,260
 So, a slight correction of my fact.

658
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,780
 One was an archaeologist, another was a geneticist,

659
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:56,860
 and this was two people called Richard Buckley,

660
00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:00,020
 who's of the University of Leicester Archaeological Services,

661
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,980
 and Professor Turi King, who's the geneticist,

662
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:06,220
 who was the person who went and did all of the DNA testing

663
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:08,860
 to prove that Richard III was who he was.

664
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,980
 So can I just say, Dan, like, maybe about two months ago,

665
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:15,380
 you did another fact, which was that someone from the movie

666
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,060
 King Richard was called Richard King?

667
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:19,820
 Yeah, the editor of the movie.

668
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:22,220
 Are you just looking up Richard King's?

669
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,940
 (LAUGHTER)

670
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,940
 It's my new hobby.

671
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:28,420
 I'm just trying to find anyone called Richard or King.

672
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:32,140
 So the big story that I'm sure everyone remembers,

673
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:34,540
 episode one of No Such Thing as a Fish,

674
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:38,580
 in which we mentioned that the reason that King Richard III

675
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:41,100
 was found was because there was a screenwriter called

676
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,500
 Philippa Langley, who was doing some research

677
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,220
 for the script that she was going to write.

678
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,660
 She was walking through Leicester.

679
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,620
 She passed a car park, and she had a sudden feeling

680
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,780
 that Richard was there.

681
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:54,300
 And so she went away, and she told her friends,

682
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,300
 and she was like, "I just felt like he was there."

683
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,660
 And she kept telling this story, and eventually she thought,

684
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,220
 "I'm going to go back and check if he's there."

685
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,300
 She goes back a year later, she walks into the car park.

686
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:06,260
 This time, she sees something that wasn't there last time,

687
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:10,140
 which is a giant R, which is painted onto the ground,

688
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,460
 which she thinks is like a helicopter sign,

689
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,700
 which just means Richard is here.

690
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:18,340
 And so she puts forward a plan to Richard Buckley,

691
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,060
 who I've just mentioned, saying,

692
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,860
 "I'd like to get a dig going here,"

693
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,420
 and she helped to raise the funds.

694
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,340
 Anyway, the story is that they found the King

695
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,620
 underneath the R, but recently,

696
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,860
 while I was trying to do some research on a photo,

697
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:32,500
 a friend of mine was in touch with Tourie King,

698
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,140
 Professor Tourie King, and she said,

699
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,260
 "Oh, you're not getting in touch about the R

700
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,100
 "underneath where he was found,"

701
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,540
 because he wasn't found underneath the R.

702
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,420
 So that's been a big story.

703
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:45,100
 So I thought, okay, because probably it's very annoying

704
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,940
 as an archaeologist or a geneticist

705
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,540
 that when you've used actual science to find

706
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:52,380
 remains of a body, that someone else is claiming

707
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,580
 that they use psychic intuition to find it.

708
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,900
 But then, she doesn't acknowledge the fact

709
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,980
 that there's huge synchronicity in the point

710
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:02,620
 that Richard and King, these two people,

711
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,900
 found the fucking body.

712
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,140
 Yeah, yeah.

713
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:09,100
 And there's a third incredible nomenclature link

714
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,100
 to this, Dan.

715
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:13,060
 So after the bones of Richard the Third were found,

716
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,460
 they were then reinterred.

717
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,420
 There was a big ceremony for the reburial

718
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,300
 of Richard the Third, and the man who made

719
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,940
 the lead-lined casket that the King was put in

720
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,860
 was called John Castleman.

721
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:27,260
 And what is a king, if not a man?

722
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,860
 Wow.

723
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,020
 Who lives in a castle.

724
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,340
 So true.

725
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,740
 And isn't that spooky?

726
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,820
 Haven't the hairs on the back of your neck gone up?

727
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:35,660
 Yeah.

728
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,580
 There's one interesting sort of spooky thing

729
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,060
 about Richard the Third,

730
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,980
 and that is that there's, I only learned this

731
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,660
 by doing this research this week,

732
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,980
 and that is that there's a theory

733
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,060
 that Leicester City won the Premier League

734
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:48,500
 with the help from Richard the Third's ghost.

735
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,060
 Oh, yes.

736
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,700
 And on the Leicester City website,

737
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,340
 they have a lot of evidence as to why this is the case.

738
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,180
 Really?

739
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,260
 So they won the league, but the season before,

740
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,540
 they were bottom of the league,

741
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,620
 and they, you know, it was about Christmas,

742
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,380
 and they'd lost, lost, lost, lost, lost.

743
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:06,380
 And then, they laid Richard the Third to rest,

744
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,260
 and nine days later, their next game

745
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,820
 was against West Ham,

746
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:12,780
 and they won that game with a last-minute goal

747
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,580
 by Andy King.

748
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,700
 No!

749
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,420
 Dun, dun, dun.

750
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,540
 This is ridiculous.

751
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,780
 And Richard was actually,

752
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:22,660
 he went from the bottom of the car park to the top,

753
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,660
 didn't he, when they dug him up?

754
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,500
 So it's awful.

755
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,340
 I feel like I've got to...

756
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,660
 I'll just tell you from the Leicester City website,

757
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,940
 that's all, that's amazing.

758
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,500
 I'm at a conspiracy theorist meeting,

759
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,260
 and it's freaking me out.

760
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,060
 I just want to mention something that I like

761
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:36,820
 about Cheery King that she discovered.

762
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,180
 So, as you say, she's a geneticist,

763
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,580
 so she was one who said,

764
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,900
 "Look, this is Richard the Third,"

765
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,940
 and the DNA match was made by comparing people

766
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:46,860
 who had descended from his mother's side of the family

767
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:49,500
 to his DNA, but she then thought,

768
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,940
 "Okay, let's just check out the other side of the family."

769
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,780
 And they...

770
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:56,980
 First of all, she and her team of geneticists,

771
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,380
 they got relations of Henry Somerset,

772
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:02,620
 who was descended from the same great-great-grandfather

773
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:05,820
 as Richard the Third, so they'd have to share DNA.

774
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,780
 They got people who were related to Henry Somerset,

775
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:11,820
 and it turned out they didn't match Richard the Third at all,

776
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:12,820
 which is very weird.

777
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,820
 It means there must have been a break somewhere

778
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,820
 in the line of succession,

779
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,820
 and so that's incredibly weird.

780
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,820
 Does that mean someone was cheating and stuff?

781
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:23,820
 It means that we suspect there's been some hanky-panky,

782
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,580
 and then there's also another guy today

783
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:27,500
 who's descended from Geoffrey Count of Anjou,

784
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,420
 who's basically the founder of the Plantagenet dynasty,

785
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,020
 and he's who it was named after,

786
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:35,100
 and that person's DNA doesn't match either of the other two's.

787
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,300
 So, basically, everyone in this dynasty

788
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,700
 was shacking around different centres, as far as I can tell.

789
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,540
 That's really cool. Richard the Third himself.

790
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:46,100
 He was born with a full set of teeth,

791
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,180
 and he was in the womb for two years.

792
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:51,380
 What? Come on. Wow!

793
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,500
 That can't be true.

794
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:56,980
 Well, these might be propaganda claims from the era.

795
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:59,580
 Yeah, in fact, there's Shakespearean propaganda claims.

796
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:02,700
 I think it's in the play that he was born with a full set of teeth.

797
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,340
 Are they pro or anti in propaganda terms?

798
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,380
 What is it? Does it sound like a compliment?

799
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,380
 What do you think?

800
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,380
 That's pretty cool.

801
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:11,580
 If you've bought a full set of teeth and you're in a mum's...

802
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,580
 Yeah, that's pretty cool.

803
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:15,980
 And heard his shoulders as well, he was born with.

804
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,860
 And it wasn't... I think Shakespeare took it from historians

805
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:24,340
 who immediately after Richard died were coming up with this slander.

806
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,780
 Or maybe it was true, we don't know.

807
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:28,140
 It's probably untrue, though.

808
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,700
 Can I just want to say one good thing about Richard the Third?

809
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,180
 Because he gets a bad rep for justifiably.

810
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:35,420
 He was probably a murderer of small boys.

811
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:38,420
 But on the bright side,

812
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:42,180
 he did introduce England's first legal aid system,

813
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,460
 which I didn't know.

814
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,460
 Yeah, so he instigated in his...

815
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,580
 What was a very short reign?

816
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,380
 He was only on the throne about two years, wasn't he?

817
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,380
 - Was he? - Yeah.

818
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,260
 Same time he was in the womb. That's insane.

819
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:56,580
 But yeah, he instigated this thing called the Court of Request.

820
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:00,140
 That meant that if you couldn't afford legal aid or legal representation,

821
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:02,140
 then you could get it. It would be provided by the state.

822
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,460
 It was very ahead of its time.

823
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,460
 - Yeah. - That's pretty cool.

824
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,980
 He founded a council of the North

825
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:08,100
 to ensure that the North got representation in government.

826
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,300
 - Great. - Yep.

827
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:12,300
 The only Northern king, really, that we've ever had.

828
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,260
 - A proper Northerner. - I got a really good fact,

829
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,820
 which I didn't look up, so it might be wrong.

830
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:20,140
 But it's so nice to set the expectations

831
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:22,020
 at the beginning of a damn thing.

832
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:26,060
 So the third word of the third scene,

833
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:30,100
 of the third act, of Richard the Third,

834
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,100
 is fourth.

835
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:38,100
 [LAUGHTER]

836
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,100
 I love that fact. That's so good.

837
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,100
 - If it's true. - If it's true.

838
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,100
 [LAUGHTER]

839
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,100
 Have you guys heard of Marmaduke Constable?

840
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,100
 That sounds great, though.

841
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:50,100
 We were just on, like, relatives of Richard the Third,

842
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:53,100
 and this is one of the really close descendants of Richard the Third,

843
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,100
 as in almost contemporary.

844
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,100
 In fact, he was contemporary.

845
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,100
 He was, yeah, his name was Marmaduke Bosworth.

846
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:01,100
 He fought at the Battle of Bosworth, where Richard was killed.

847
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:05,100
 He also, and that was the year 1485, just to say,

848
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,100
 he also fought against the Scots at the Battle of Northumberland.

849
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,100
 That was in 1513.

850
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:14,100
 He was aged 71 when he took actively part in that battle.

851
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:18,100
 He only died in 1518, aged about 75 years old,

852
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:21,100
 when he choked to death drinking a glass of water

853
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,100
 which had a frog in it.

854
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:26,100
 [LAUGHTER]

855
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:30,100
 So Richard the Third died, like you say, in the Battle of Bosworth.

856
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,100
 We've found, you know, we've checked the bones,

857
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,100
 and we reckon that he lost his helmet

858
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:37,100
 and came under a hail of 11 wounds at the same time,

859
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,100
 and that's what did him in.

860
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,100
 But traditionally, he's supposed to have been killed

861
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:43,100
 by a soldier called Ralph Rudyard.

862
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:46,100
 Ralph Rudyard's family went on to own a lake in Staffordshire

863
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,100
 called Rudyard Lake.

864
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,100
 Rudyard Lake, we've said before,

865
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:53,100
 is where Rudyard Kipling's name comes from.

866
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:56,100
 Right, so his parents went there and they really loved it,

867
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,100
 and they thought we'll name him after the lake.

868
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:01,100
 So Ralph Rudyard's family owned this Rudyard Lake,

869
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,100
 but they owned two lakes in the area,

870
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,100
 one on each side of a hill.

871
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:08,100
 Rudyard Lake and another one called Titty's Worth.

872
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,100
 [LAUGHTER]

873
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,100
 So that means that Rudyard Kipling

874
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:15,100
 could so easily have been called Titty's Worth Kipling.

875
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:18,100
 [LAUGHTER]

876
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,100
 That's really great.

877
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,100
 Can I quickly go back to Cherry King a second?

878
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,100
 Yeah, sure.

879
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,100
 I just want to say there's been an interesting thing

880
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,100
 that's been in the news recently.

881
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,100
 So there's actually a movie that's just been made.

882
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:32,100
 Steve Coogan has made a movie of the story

883
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,100
 of Philippa Langley finding Richard III,

884
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:38,100
 and in it, the sort of plot line is that

885
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,100
 she has this psychic intuition,

886
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:43,100
 and the scientists and archaeologists and geneticists in it

887
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,100
 are kind of portrayed in that classic way

888
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:48,100
 of being really rational and really unkind,

889
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,100
 and they're really pissed off because they weren't.

890
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:53,100
 And if you watch Cherry King, just in case you see that movie

891
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,100
 and you think, oh, scientists are bad, she's awesome.

892
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,100
 She's really cool.

893
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,100
 She's found incredible stuff as a geneticist.

894
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:01,100
 So she goes around doing DNA for all these finds.

895
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,100
 When she was trying to find out about Vikings,

896
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:07,100
 she found that many men just came in to give their DNA,

897
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:11,100
 because apparently most men think they're Viking.

898
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,100
 That's the thing.

899
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:15,100
 She was like, there was no trouble getting volunteers

900
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,100
 for people saying, are you Viking?

901
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,100
 Because people are coming and going, well, I definitely am.

902
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,100
 So let's prove this.

903
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,100
 Are we sure that a lot of men didn't do it because they thought,

904
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:24,100
 maybe they'll give me an iPad and some free porn for half an hour.

905
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,100
 And that's how I'm donating my DNA.

906
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,100
 Was that how you donate your DNA?

907
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,100
 I don't think so.

908
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,100
 I thought it was a cheek swab.

909
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,100
 I'm saying that's what they thought.

910
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,100
 OK.

911
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,100
 Well, thank God you clarified that.

912
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,100
 Otherwise, you would have been straight down there.

913
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,100
 Yeah, and if I'm giving you a call when I'm in jail,

914
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,100
 because I took my dick out during a...

915
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,100
 It was meant to be a cheek swab.

916
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:47,100
 Swab this cheek.

917
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,100
 LAUGHTER

918
00:36:49,100 --> 00:37:00,100
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show,

919
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,100
 and that is Andy.

920
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:05,100
 My fact is that to establish dominance,

921
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,100
 the sarcastic fringe-head fish

922
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:11,100
 will engage in kissing competitions with rival males.

923
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:14,100
 And here's the fish.

924
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,100
 So there's a picture of it on the screen here.

925
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,100
 The sarcastic fringe fish.

926
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:22,100
 The sarcastic fringe-head.

927
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,100
 They're really bizarre fish.

928
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,100
 Oh, I should give credit for this.

929
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,100
 This was actually sent in to us by @FlockOfWords online,

930
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,100
 so thank you so much.

931
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,100
 They're called Neoclinus Blanchardi.

932
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:34,100
 They live off North America on the Pacific side,

933
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:37,100
 and they're really ugly-looking.

934
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,100
 They're kind of tiny, little brown fish,

935
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,100
 and they live in holes, and they jump out,

936
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,100
 and they go, "Wah!" at their prey,

937
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:46,100
 like they're kind of these gross, awful fish.

938
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,100
 But the one amazing and beautiful thing about them,

939
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,100
 they have this enormous mouth,

940
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,100
 as in their mouth is wider than the entire body,

941
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:55,100
 because it's got these huge sort of supporting struts,

942
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,100
 and they've got big, flappy cheeks,

943
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,100
 and they can just sort of go, "Wah!"

944
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,100
 Sounds beautiful.

945
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:03,100
 It's a bit like just to give a visual to the audience.

946
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,100
 It's a bit like, even though it's part of their mouth,

947
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:09,100
 you remember in Jurassic Park when the dinosaur comes up

948
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,100
 and it suddenly looks, it's looking cute,

949
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,100
 and it spreads those frills.

950
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:16,100
 It's kind of like that, except that's its mouth, not its frills.

951
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,100
 It's really like that.

952
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,100
 And they have this weird, weird ritual

953
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:22,100
 where if they are near a rival male,

954
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,100
 and it's the mating season,

955
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,100
 they will both yawn open

956
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,100
 and kind of push their mouths against each other

957
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,100
 to see who's got the bigger mouth,

958
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,100
 and this is the intimidating thing.

959
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:35,100
 In my experience, that's not what kissing is.

960
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:39,100
 Maybe I'm doing it wrong,

961
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:43,100
 but it's not always like, "Let's see who has the biggest mouth."

962
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,100
 Well, I've got some apologies to make

963
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:49,100
 because I'm, like, undefeated champion.

964
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:53,100
 And the smaller male,

965
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,100
 or the male with the smaller mouth, rather,

966
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,100
 will surrender and leave.

967
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,100
 And they do, but they basically are sort of...

968
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,100
 But it does.

969
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,100
 Because they're both about the same size,

970
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,100
 it does look like they kind of make it out.

971
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,100
 So it's not proper, proper kissing.

972
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:09,100
 If one has a smaller head, sometimes the bigger mouth

973
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:12,100
 will be able to fit the smaller one's head inside its mouth.

974
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,100
 Oh, my God, really?

975
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,100
 Which is my memory of year nine discos.

976
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:21,100
 One thing I couldn't get to the bottom of is,

977
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,100
 so they do the mouth display,

978
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,100
 the sort of dominance thing.

979
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,100
 If they were to have a fight, then,

980
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:30,100
 off the back of that, like, let's now have a fight,

981
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:33,100
 what is the advantage of having a bigger mouth?

982
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,100
 Other than, obviously, they're a bit bigger,

983
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,100
 but does that mean that they're going to win in a fight?

984
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,100
 Not really. They actually almost never have an actual fight.

985
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,100
 Yeah.

986
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,100
 They will slightly, they might slightly bump into each other,

987
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,100
 but that's just not the way they do it,

988
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,100
 as in it's not in their repertoire.

989
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,100
 It's just like basically going at a year nine disco

990
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:50,100
 to another guy and then doing your muscles and saying,

991
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,100
 "Look, my muscles are bigger than you,

992
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,100
 but I really don't want to fight you."

993
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,100
 OK.

994
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,100
 You guys had crazy year nine discos, you and Anna.

995
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,100
 I can't believe you guys went to the year nine disco.

996
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,100
 I wasn't allowed to go, and I...

997
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:04,100
 Good news is, it sounds like I missed nothing at all.

998
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:10,100
 But they do, I mean, these jaws, they have quite sharp teeth,

999
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,100
 so they can kind of bite and hurt you,

1000
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:15,100
 but they just tend not to do it to each other.

1001
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,100
 Like, if you go near their house,

1002
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:20,100
 they'll do this kind of sort of scary, big, open mouth thing,

1003
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:23,100
 but then, if you don't go away, they'll actually go for you,

1004
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,100
 and they are, you know, they do have a hefty bite on them.

1005
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,100
 Yeah, they'll bite humans, won't they,

1006
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,100
 when you say you, actually you, divers?

1007
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,100
 And that's where sarcastic comes from, by the way,

1008
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:33,100
 'cause we think, you know, does it have, like,

1009
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:36,100
 some sort of, like, is it like the Anna Tyshinski of fish?

1010
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:40,100
 But no, it's sarcastic means that it's a Greek word,

1011
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:43,100
 sarcasmos, and to bite or tear...

1012
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,100
 Oh, is that right?

1013
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,100
 Yeah.

1014
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,100
 Yeah, right.

1015
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,100
 It does.

1016
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:51,100
 It comes from, I think, Sarko, its flesh.

1017
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,100
 So it's to...

1018
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:55,100
 And so, sarcasmain or whatever, to bite flesh.

1019
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:57,100
 And it's where we get sarcophagus,

1020
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,100
 which I'd never thought about,

1021
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:01,100
 but sarcophagus, Sarko is flesh,

1022
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:04,100
 and then faggo, faggo, so it means eat, I eat.

1023
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,100
 So it's flesh-eating.

1024
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:08,100
 A sarcophagus is something that's eating your flesh.

1025
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,100
 Ah.

1026
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,100
 Gross.

1027
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:15,100
 They have these kind of bright yellow lips, don't they?

1028
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,100
 The people in here can see them just about, I think,

1029
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,100
 but for the people at home,

1030
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,100
 you kind of have really bright yellow lips,

1031
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,100
 and then on the inside, it's kind of a little bit colourful,

1032
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,100
 but not really.

1033
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:27,100
 But in actual fact, those bits on the inside of the mouth

1034
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,100
 reflect ultraviolet light.

1035
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:32,100
 So to anyone under the sea that can see ultraviolet light,

1036
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:34,100
 which is a lot and a lot of fish can see it,

1037
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,100
 actually, that also looks like there's a massive sort of disco

1038
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,100
 coming out of his mouth.

1039
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,100
 Right.

1040
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,100
 They are so cool.

1041
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,100
 It does look...

1042
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,100
 I think that it's very beautiful with its mouth open.

1043
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,100
 It looks like...

1044
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:47,100
 It really reminds me of having your face painted at a fair.

1045
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:51,100
 It looks like a kid's gone mad with face paint on them.

1046
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:55,100
 Their mouths are so big that it's possible they struggle to eat.

1047
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,100
 And that sounds bizarre.

1048
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,100
 Really?

1049
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:00,100
 They're a particular kind of fish called a blenny.

1050
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,100
 There's a huge, great family of fish.

1051
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:05,100
 And they are tube blenny, which live in tubes.

1052
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:08,100
 And most tube blenny feed on small plankton.

1053
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,100
 But the male sarcastic fringe head,

1054
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:13,100
 its mouth is so big that it can't suck anymore.

1055
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:17,100
 So it seems to struggle a bit sometimes to eat plankton.

1056
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:20,100
 It's sort of filtered in because it's just got this huge grip.

1057
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,100
 Yes.

1058
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,100
 It's like when your...

1059
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:25,100
 If your toilet's clogged and you need to use a plunger,

1060
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:29,100
 but sometimes the plunger head is too big to get suction on the actual whole bit.

1061
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,100
 And so it's a pointless suction plan.

1062
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:36,100
 I don't think anyone was actually struggling to grip the original point.

1063
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,100
 But thank you so much.

1064
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:40,100
 Glad to help.

1065
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:42,100
 But now all you've done is connected our minds,

1066
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,100
 opening our mouths with a blocked toilet.

1067
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:46,100
 And we've all gone to the same place.

1068
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,100
 Blenny's not...

1069
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,100
 Yeah, they're a huge family, aren't they?

1070
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:51,100
 There are so many cool fish in the blenny family.

1071
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:56,100
 But one of the things they have is they have the only fish that suckles its young.

1072
00:42:56,100 --> 00:43:01,100
 So the only thing on our show that suckles like we do, yeah, the Viviparis eel pout.

1073
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:06,100
 So Viviparis being, you know, they give birth to live young, hence that name.

1074
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:10,100
 But when they're pregnant and they have six-month-long pregnancies, which is pretty...

1075
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,100
 Oh, it's a quarter the length of Richard the Third.

1076
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:14,100
 Yeah, absolutely, yeah.

1077
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:16,100
 Is that long for a fish?

1078
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,100
 It's long, yeah, yeah.

1079
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,100
 It's good for a fish.

1080
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:21,100
 Usually the bigger the animal, the longer the gestation period.

1081
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:23,100
 OK, and these are like 30 centimetres, right?

1082
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,100
 Yeah, yeah, they're long.

1083
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:29,100
 But the way they suckle is inside, they sort of live in the ovaries.

1084
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:30,100
 They don't have a separate uterus.

1085
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:32,100
 And they've got ovarian follicles.

1086
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:37,100
 And each little fish embryo suckles on a follicle, one inside the fish.

1087
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:39,100
 And there are up to 400 of them.

1088
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:44,100
 So imagine it's like you've got 400 breasts and a baby on every one in there.

1089
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,100
 Wow!

1090
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:46,100
 That's amazing.

1091
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:48,100
 A massive mouth, yeah.

1092
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,100
 Yeah.

1093
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:53,100
 There was a website called World Wide Words, I don't know if you guys have seen it.

1094
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,100
 It's online, it's a really, really good website.

1095
00:43:55,100 --> 00:44:00,100
 They've collected a list of animals with names that are suggestive of emotion,

1096
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:03,100
 of which the sarcastic fringe head is one of them.

1097
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:07,100
 So there's a few here, the festive midget.

1098
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:11,100
 That's the species of moth that's found in North America.

1099
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:14,100
 The confused flower beetle.

1100
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:19,100
 That's confused because it looks a bit like another kind of beetle,

1101
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:22,100
 not just walking around, not knowing what's going on.

1102
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:24,100
 And the depressed mussel.

1103
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,100
 Wow!

1104
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:27,100
 They call that because they have a flat shell.

1105
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:30,100
 All mussels seem kind of depressed to me.

1106
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:34,100
 I mostly see them actually on a plate, so that doesn't make sense.

1107
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:36,100
 Have you heard of the tetra fish?

1108
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:40,100
 I'm just going on general fish mating and aggression displays now.

1109
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:41,100
 Tetra fish is unbelievable.

1110
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:43,100
 Sailfin tetras.

1111
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:47,100
 So there are dominant males, and there are also smaller, more feeble males.

1112
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:50,100
 Both of them are competing for the attention of females.

1113
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:54,100
 The dominant ones, you would think, they're very active.

1114
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:56,100
 In fact, they do nothing.

1115
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:59,100
 They hide in some sort of kelp.

1116
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:01,100
 Kelp, thank you.

1117
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:02,100
 They just hide.

1118
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:05,100
 So the low-ranking males have the run of the place, right?

1119
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:07,100
 And they do all these mating displays.

1120
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:10,100
 And they're trying to persuade the female that they're a good prospect

1121
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:12,100
 and they're good to have sex with.

1122
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:16,100
 And they do days and days of work persuading the female to have sex, right?

1123
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:19,100
 And when they have finally got the female to agree,

1124
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:22,100
 and they're going off to the mating zone,

1125
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:25,100
 a more dominant male will just emerge from the kelp

1126
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:29,100
 and say, "Thank you very much. I'll take it from here."

1127
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:32,100
 And the female just goes off with him every time.

1128
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:35,100
 She's like, "Right, I'm now in the mood, and here's an even better offer."

1129
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:37,100
 That was my urinine disco.

1130
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:41,100
 And this is a thing called courtship piracy.

1131
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:44,100
 And the dominant males are just finding good hiding places

1132
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:47,100
 right near the mating zone, and then just popping out of the last minute.

1133
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:50,100
 Why do they keep doing it, the little nerd ones?

1134
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:52,100
 They just accept it. It's so weird.

1135
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:53,100
 They never fight.

1136
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:55,100
 Well, maybe occasionally they get lucky.

1137
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:56,100
 Yeah, exactly.

1138
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:59,100
 Yeah, they must hope that somewhere in the kelp there's no...

1139
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:02,100
 It must just be like kind of looking in all the kelp and stuff.

1140
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:04,100
 There's definitely none there.

1141
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:06,100
 Exactly, yeah.

1142
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:10,100
 Female brown trouts, they fake orgasms.

1143
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,100
 Oh, yeah.

1144
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:13,100
 So it's kind of a similar thing.

1145
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:18,100
 So what will happen is, if a male and a female trouter are having sex,

1146
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:21,100
 by which I mean one laying eggs and the other one spawning over it,

1147
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:25,100
 then another male or other males might come in the area.

1148
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:27,100
 They might kind of turn up and say, "I want a bit of that."

1149
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:30,100
 Would you say, "Come in the area?" Do you mean they might?

1150
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:32,100
 We might get to that.

1151
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:37,100
 So what they'll often do is the female brown trout will kind of meet up with a male,

1152
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:40,100
 who she's kind of not sure about, she's kind of fancies but not sure,

1153
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:44,100
 and then they'll do this sort of shuddering thing.

1154
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:47,100
 They'll both shudder, and usually when they both shudder,

1155
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:50,100
 the females release the eggs and the males release the sperm.

1156
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:54,100
 But actually, often the females will kind of hold onto their eggs while they're doing that,

1157
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:58,100
 because they know that other males in the area will turn up,

1158
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:02,100
 and then the other males will fight with the guy she was supposedly shagging,

1159
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:06,100
 and then they will all fight, and then hopefully she'll end up with an even better male,

1160
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:08,100
 who she can then actually have sex with.

1161
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:10,100
 - Nice. - That is ingenious.

1162
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:12,100
 - Smart, isn't it? - That's really smart.

1163
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:16,100
 I want to hear what a trout fake orgasm sounds like.

1164
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:20,100
 I want to see the when Harry met Sally of the trout world.

1165
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:23,100
 I'll have what she's having, what, some plankton?

1166
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:26,100
 Yes.

1167
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:29,100
 - There's one in just sticklebacks. - Yeah.

1168
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:31,100
 Male sticklebacks also are very territorial.

1169
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:34,100
 The males fight a lot, and when it's in mating season,

1170
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:37,100
 and in mating season they go red on their undersides,

1171
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:40,100
 so the way they spot other males to fight is they see a flash of red,

1172
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:43,100
 but apparently they're not very good at distinguishing fish from other stuff,

1173
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:47,100
 so if you've got a pet stickleback, if like a red post fan goes by,

1174
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:50,100
 they'll fling themselves at the side of their tank.

1175
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,100
 The Welsh football team goes past.

1176
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:55,100
 Yes, exactly. They'll attack them all.

1177
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:58,100
 Don't wear red around the sticklebacks.

1178
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:00,100
 Speaking of going red, this is not in fish.

1179
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,100
 This is in mandrills, so the primates,

1180
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:07,100
 but it is about males attacking each other to try and get a female,

1181
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:09,100
 so they will kind of try and become the alpha male,

1182
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:12,100
 and if there's an alpha male, then you will fight against them,

1183
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:14,100
 and if you beat them, you become the alpha male,

1184
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:17,100
 and if you become the alpha male,

1185
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:20,100
 immediately, just as this biologically happens,

1186
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:24,100
 all the sexual skin on your face and genitalia turns red,

1187
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:28,100
 and the guy who you've beaten, his sexual skin,

1188
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:31,100
 goes kind of more bluey and less red,

1189
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:34,100
 and your testicles increase in size,

1190
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:38,100
 and the person you defeated, their testicles decrease in size.

1191
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:39,100
 Really?

1192
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:41,100
 It automatically happens as soon as you win the fight.

1193
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:44,100
 Popping off to the mandrel tale of the next morning.

1194
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:47,100
 Congratulations on your winning your fight last night, sir.

1195
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:50,100
 I'll be expanding the cropped area of these.

1196
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:52,100
 That's so good.

1197
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:54,100
 What's the sexual skin on your face?

1198
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:56,100
 Do we have sexual skin on our face?

1199
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:59,100
 Well, some of us do, Andy, but don't worry about it.

1200
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:03,100
 It means that it changed colour,

1201
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:05,100
 so that secondary sexual characteristics...

1202
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:06,100
 Oh, I think it's amazing to sort of...

1203
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:08,100
 ...like, females find it attractive.

1204
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:09,100
 Blushing.

1205
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:10,100
 Blushing, yeah, pretty much.

1206
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:11,100
 That's our sexual skin.

1207
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:12,100
 I don't know, man.

1208
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:14,100
 If you've got nothing else to offer, maybe, but...

1209
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:15,100
 Right.

1210
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:21,100
 Because we've got little bits of clitoris in our nose, don't we?

1211
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:22,100
 Excuse me?

1212
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:25,100
 Well, speak for yourself, Dan.

1213
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:28,100
 You know how they say that men can't find the clitoris?

1214
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:32,100
 I'm pretty sure it's in my own nose.

1215
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:39,100
 Well, I thought, yeah, the inside of the nose is...

1216
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:41,100
 You have a erectile tissue in your nose,

1217
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,100
 but I don't think that's quite the same.

1218
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:45,100
 Is that what it is?

1219
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:47,100
 That's what I was thinking of.

1220
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:49,100
 When blood will go to it and it will get engorged,

1221
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:53,100
 your poor wife is jamming your fingers up her nose every evening.

1222
00:49:53,100 --> 00:50:01,100
 Was it good for you?

1223
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:03,100
 Well, it wasn't that good, I have to say.

1224
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:12,100
 Well, I feel like we've all learned a lot tonight.

1225
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:16,100
 I'm going to go home and apologize to my wife.

1226
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:18,100
 I feel we should all go home as well.

1227
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:20,100
 That's it, that is all of our facts.

1228
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,100
 Thank you so much for listening.

1229
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:24,100
 If you would like to get in contact with any of us

1230
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:27,100
 about the things that we've said over the course of this podcast,

1231
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:30,100
 get the other three, maybe not me on this one.

1232
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:33,100
 But you can get me on @Sriberland, Andy.

1233
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:34,100
 @AndrewHunter.

1234
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:35,100
 @James.

1235
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:36,100
 @JamesHarken.

1236
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:37,100
 And Anna.

1237
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,100
 You can email our podcast at qi.com.

1238
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:42,100
 Or you can go to our group account, which is @NoSuchThing.

1239
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:44,100
 Or our website, NoSuchThing, is at fish.com.

1240
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:47,100
 All of our previous episodes are on there,

1241
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:49,100
 as well as a link to Club Fish.

1242
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:51,100
 This is our new exciting venture,

1243
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:54,100
 where we have awesome hidden places

1244
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:57,100
 where you can chat to other fish fans as a community.

1245
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:59,100
 There's also ad-free episodes.

1246
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:01,100
 Oh, shut up, James.

1247
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:03,100
 Stop talking about hidden places.

1248
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:05,100
 I can't look at you in the face anymore.

1249
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:09,100
 Or what else can you do?

1250
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:12,100
 You can have extra episodes, like Drop Us a Line.

1251
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:14,100
 It's our correspondence place,

1252
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:16,100
 where we chat about all of the facts that you're sending in

1253
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:17,100
 and all the letters.

1254
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:21,100
 Otherwise, we will be back here in Carter for another show

1255
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:23,100
 sometime soon, I really hope.

1256
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:25,100
 So thank you so much for having us,

1257
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:27,100
 for everyone at home listening to the show.

1258
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:29,100
 We'll be back again next week with another episode.

1259
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,100
 We'll see you then.

1260
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:31,100
 Goodbye!

1261
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:36,100
 (upbeat music)

1262
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:41,100
 (crowd cheering)

1263
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:43,680
 (upbeat music)

1264
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,260
 (upbeat music)
