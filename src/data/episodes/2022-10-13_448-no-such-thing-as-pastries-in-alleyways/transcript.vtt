00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.640
 Hi everyone, before we start this week's episode

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.040
 of No Such Things as Fish,

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.080
 I just wanted to quickly remind you

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.760
 about our super special members area known by us

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.880
 and everyone who sees the name as Club Fish.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.840
 It's a wonderful place where you get loads

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.560
 of bonus content, you get all the episodes

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.040
 without any adverts.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.300
 You'll be the first to hear about any live shows

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.120
 we're gonna do and we have a thing called a Discord.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.200
 Now for the uninitiated, such as myself,

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.480
 a Discord is a place where you can go

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.480
 and chat all things fish with like-minded fish fans.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.200
 It's a really cool place to be,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.680
 loads of fellow listeners on there

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.980
 and you might even see the odd member

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.800
 of No Such Things as Fish popping up from time to time.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.760
 And when I say the odd member, I mean Dan, of course.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.240
 Like I always mean when I say the odd member.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.800
 (laughs)

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.880
 Actually, while I'm here, I might as well remind you

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.040
 that Dan has a book out.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.880
 It's called The Theory of Everything Else.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.040
 It's absolutely amazing.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.720
 It's basically all of Dan's brain printed in a book

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.480
 and what could be more enticing than that.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.480
 Let's be honest.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.320
 So go out and buy that and join Club Fish if you'd like

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.000
 and the place to join Club Fish

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.340
 is NoSuchThingAsAFish.com

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.200
 and all the information about how to subscribe to Club Fish

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.400
 through Apple Podcasts or Patreon is there.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.280
 Okay, on with the podcast.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.860
 (upbeat music)

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.140
 (phone ringing)

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.820
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:41.360
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.160
 of No Such Thing As A Fish, a weekly podcast.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.340
 This week coming to you live from Cardiff.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.340
 (audience cheering)

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.280
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.940
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski and Drew Hunter Murray

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.140
 and James Harkin.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.820
 And once again, we have gathered round the microphones

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.060
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.460
 And in a particular order, here we go.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.260
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Anna.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.580
 - My fact this week is that croissant shaped croissants

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.500
 taste worse than non-croissant shaped croissants.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.500
 (audience laughing)

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.340
 - Croissant?

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.160
 - That's a pretty hard sentence to say.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.760
 - It feels more like a complaint to waitros than a fact.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.000
 (audience laughing)

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.460
 - It's actually, it's more of a complaint

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.900
 to the country of France.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.280
 (audience laughing)

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.580
 - When you say croissant shaped croissant,

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.720
 you mean like a crescent shaped croissant.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.040
 - Exactly.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.640
 - You're classic croissant.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.720
 - A classic croissant.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.360
 - Well, it's not actually a classic,

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.720
 but it is, the name obviously croissant comes from the fact

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.600
 that it is, you know, in the old school sense,

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.960
 crescent shaped, curved, but.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.200
 - Why is it not classic?

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.760
 - Well, just because today, so many of them are straight,

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.240
 and I couldn't believe.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.860
 - You can't redesign the classic, that's the classic.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.200
 That's what that word means.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.500
 - They've updated the classic.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.440
 It's a modern classic.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.040
 - Modern classic, yeah.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.880
 - The modern classic is a straight croissant,

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.880
 and they taste nicer.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.720
 Facts.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.060
 (audience laughing)

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.600
 - Surely they're just a different shape,

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.080
 so how can they taste different?

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.460
 - Ah, so glad you asked.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.880
 - Almost like I know the answer.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.500
 - You'll probably know this if you are French,

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.960
 or if you work in a pÃ¢tisserie,

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.360
 but basically, you know, if like straight croissants,

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.600
 so they're fat in the middle and thin on the outsides,

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.480
 but they go in a straight line,

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.600
 they are all butter croissants, okay?

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.720
 But curved ones, in that little C crescent shaped,

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.320
 croissant shape, they can actually just be made

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.600
 with oil or margarine, which as everyone knows,

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.640
 tastes inferior.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.520
 - But interestingly, a lot of French people

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.480
 prefer the margarine one,

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.780
 'cause apparently it dunks better in coffee.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.100
 - Yeah, there are claims about this.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.580
 I feel like that's people trying to be contrary,

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.300
 'cause let's face it, all butter croissants,

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.540
 they're more expensive, they're more luxurious.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.340
 In France, you know, the adults would get

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.020
 the straight croissants, and they'd give their kids

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.620
 the shitty, cheaper, curved croissants,

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.940
 'cause they're made with margarine, I read that somewhere,

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.220
 and I think this is mad.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.300
 There are some claims that it's actually by law

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.340
 that margarine croissants are not allowed to be straight,

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.820
 but I can't find that law anywhere,

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.800
 but it certainly is practice across France.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.800
 - Somewhere in the French parliament,

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.000
 they will have a croissant division

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.720
 who are looking into croissant-related legislation.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.400
 - But it's not the butter that turns the croissant

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.240
 into a crescent.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.760
 - Right, the butter doesn't do anything.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.440
 There's nothing that's happening chemically here.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.400
 It's just in practice.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.040
 Just the rule is, if you work in a boulangerie,

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.760
 if it's all butter croissants, it's straight.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.440
 And if you want to make an all butter croissant curved,

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.680
 you can, but if you want to make a margarine croissant

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.420
 straight, you're going to prison.

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:53.940
 (laughing)

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.820
 - But fortunately, in French prison,

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.840
 the wine selection is very good,

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.780
 and you'll actually have a nice time.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.140
 So there was a coup in 2016, and this is in the UK,

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.420
 a croissant-related coup, which is Tesco replaced

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.860
 all of its curved croissants with straight croissants,

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.860
 and they did it, as in they just announced it,

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.220
 and they said right from tomorrow,

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.100
 they gave people no notice or warning.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.180
 (laughing)

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.860
 - 'Cause you might've gone in and just bought

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.260
 the entire stock, right, New?

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.160
 - Well, you can't stock up, can you,

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.680
 'cause you have to buy them fresh every day.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.480
 So they knew that their customers

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.680
 would be snooker the next day, but they just said,

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.120
 they claimed, okay, they made this claim,

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.080
 which I think is bizarre, they claimed it was due

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.280
 to the spreadability factor that they were,

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.200
 they were actually making life easier for their customers.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.640
 They said, if you cut open a straight croissant,

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.960
 it's very easy to put in your jam or whatever.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.840
 Obviously, if you cut open a curved croissant,

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.680
 it's a nightmare, and it takes hours, blah, blah, blah.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.480
 - I, do you know, people took the piss at the time,

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.880
 and it was the boss of Tesco, Harry Jones, who said this,

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.820
 but I genuinely agree with him.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.820
 He said, when the croissants curved,

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.720
 people can take up to three attempts

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.220
 to achieve perfect coverage, which increases,

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.260
 increases the potential for accidents

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.260
 involving sticky fingers and tables.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.380
 But honestly, it is harder to spread a curved croissant.

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.300
 - So I wanna, I want to, and I can't,

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.860
 because he's not here, and I don't know him,

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.980
 pick him up on that sentence.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.980
 Sticky fingers causes accidents and other problems.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.420
 What the fuck is he talking about?

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.040
 (laughing)

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.960
 - What on earth is that sentence?

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.920
 And he said 75% of people who were surveyed

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.640
 wanted the straighter croissant because of,

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.080
 as Andy says, the spreadability factor.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.360
 - Am I the only one who doesn't cut open a croissant

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.680
 and spread jam in it?

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:33.520
 - No, I don't.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.820
 - I just find that so weird, and the other interesting

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.120
 thing about croissants is, in that kind of respect,

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.800
 is, you know the idea that, especially when you go to France,

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.080
 you see them, and they're cut in half,

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.240
 and they put like ham and cheese and stuff in the middle.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.700
 - Oh, that's here as well, yeah.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:50.500
 - But that was only invented in the 1970s.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:51.340
 - Wow.

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:52.180
 - You know that?

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.020
 So the French, they decided to do this

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.220
 because they were worried that American hamburgers

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.980
 were coming over to France, and they thought,

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:58.500
 what can we do to stop--

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.580
 (laughing)

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.300
 Holy, the march of the hamburger, I know what we can do.

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.460
 We can put ham and cheese inside our croissants.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.580
 - That's the French hamburger, I didn't know that.

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.000
 - There were these places called croissanteries

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.100
 across France, and they were created in the 1970s

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.740
 as a big government, like, status intervention

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:16.320
 in the market to deal with the scourge

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.060
 of what they call le fast food.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:19.400
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.080
 - I just can't imagine ever anyone's like,

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.720
 oh, it's 1 a.m., God, it's McDonald's open.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.720
 No, but the croissanteries are fantastic.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.680
 - I stayed in a four-star all-inclusive recently.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:31.520
 - Woo!

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.040
 - Bloody hell, Dan.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.000
 - Yeah, and it was really interesting.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.880
 They had this bit of new technology I've seen nowhere before,

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.960
 which is, during the breakfast buffet, they had croissants,

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.320
 and you would select your croissant,

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.700
 of which there was almond, and just classic plain,

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.460
 and chocolate, you get a plain one,

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.300
 and then they had all these pipes coming out,

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.420
 kind of like if you were pouring a pint, right?

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:54.020
 There was like seven of these pint-pulling things,

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:56.180
 and what they did is they take your croissant over,

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:59.060
 and one dispenses chocolate, one does jam, and so on,

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:02.340
 and what they do is they shove the croissant into the pipe,

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:05.660
 and then they pump it full of chocolate, or jam, or whatever.

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:07.500
 Oh my good, it was like seeing the future.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.220
 I couldn't believe it.

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:10.940
 They came back, and I was like, in Italy,

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:12.740
 they've got the future in the four-star-inclusives,

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:13.580
 it's amazing.

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:15.160
 I was really thinking when he launched on this story,

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.240
 I think I know more about breakfast buffet technology

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.720
 than Dan does, and I didn't.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.360
 I'm stunned.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.240
 You need to know where that is now, don't you, Andy,

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.520
 'cause you are a bit of an expert on breakfast buffets.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.800
 The last all-inclusive I went to on the breakfast buffet,

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.800
 they had Haribo's, and I must admit,

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.000
 I did not eat a single croissant that week.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.040
 The French, of course, should actually put Haribo

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:37.600
 on their croissants.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.400
 One thing about croissants that's really interesting

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.040
 is that they're quite new, right?

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:44.980
 So the oldest recipe, as far as I could find,

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:47.100
 which is of a traditional classic,

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.740
 or even modern classic, croissant, is from 1906.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:52.940
 And so that means that Napoleon didn't eat croissants,

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:54.940
 Bolzac, Victor Hugo, Georges Sainte,

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:56.980
 they never ate a croissant in their life.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:57.820
 Wow.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:59.540
 Maybe that's why they were so productive.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:02.780
 Maybe the croissants led to the downfall of France.

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:06.580
 Did you guys hear about Operation Croissant?

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:07.420
 No.

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:08.500
 Operation Croissant was something

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:09.940
 that was launched in 2016.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:13.360
 It was an Anglo-French operation.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.600
 It was the day before the Brexit vote,

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.680
 and a campaign group tried to campaign on Brexit

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:20.920
 with Operation Croissant, which was giving out croissants

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:24.440
 accompanied by pro-EU messages written by people in France

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.960
 on postcards saying, please, you know, don't leave.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.280
 And the croissants get this,

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.160
 they had been baked that morning, the 22nd of June,

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.320
 and they come to London on the first Euro star of the day,

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.400
 and there were 600 croissants, which would be on there.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.760
 That's a lot of effort for something

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.460
 that ended up being completely fucking useless, isn't it?

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:44.940
 It's very romantic, though, and very French,

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.980
 and they had 600 croissants ready to give out,

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:50.540
 and then the police interceded.

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:52.740
 The police stopped them and said it's illegal

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.460
 to use food, drink, or entertainment to influence a vote.

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:56.300
 Oh, it is, yeah.

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:59.500
 And so they were all imprisoned, actually,

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:02.100
 for, there's some of them are still in.

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.100
 No, they issued a statement saying,

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:05.940
 we are happy to fall on our baguettes

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:08.180
 and stick to the right side of British law.

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:13.180
 Have you guys heard this is an America of the Cronut?

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:14.780
 Yeah. Yeah.

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.460
 Am I the only one who hasn't heard of the Cronut?

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:17.460
 I think it might be.

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:19.580
 Oh, okay.

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:22.580
 Have you guys heard of the Croffin?

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:23.580
 It's Croffin.

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:24.940
 Okay. No.

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:29.220
 Do you know, I reckon, between us, even if we haven't,

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:30.500
 I reckon we can put it together.

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:31.340
 Go on then.

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:33.100
 It's a Cronut full of stuffing, isn't it?

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:34.060
 Yeah. Yeah.

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:36.420
 It's a Christmas, it's a Christmas crustal,

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:38.380
 full of stuff, yeah.

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:40.340
 So anyway, you guys must have facts.

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:41.340
 No, no, this is...

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:44.420
 Hey, Dan, have you heard of the Cromosa?

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:47.180
 Cromosa.

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:49.860
 Someone gasped then, as if this is the greatest thing

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:50.980
 they've ever heard.

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:54.300
 Basically, a croissant with Samosa filling and then deep-fried.

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:55.980
 Oh, lovely. Yeah.

00:10:55.980 --> 00:11:00.300
 Have you heard of, if we're doing this, which I think we are,

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:01.500
 a Kregel?

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.180
 A Kregel. Okay.

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:04.980
 Yep. Yep.

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:06.220
 That's a croissant and a bagel?

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:07.500
 Anyone like to take the next one?

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.100
 Oh, have you heard of one? I'll go for one.

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:10.500
 A townie.

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.420
 A townie. It's not very politically correct, James.

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:13.980
 There are no croissants involved.

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:14.900
 What is it?

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:17.140
 It's a half tart, half brownie.

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:18.660
 Oh!

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:21.300
 And finally, one more, a doughnut.

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:22.380
 You know what that is?

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:24.260
 A pug, a pug and a doughnut.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:25.900
 A pug that's been turned into a doughnut.

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:27.340
 Yes!

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:28.860
 It's not so far off.

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:32.220
 It's a doughnut crossed with a chicken nugget.

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:33.060
 Ah!

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:36.980
 Which is basically just a doughnut-shaped chicken nugget.

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:38.140
 Wow.

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:40.740
 It still tastes the same.

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:43.260
 The cronut, an interesting thing about the cronut,

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.500
 is that this was made in 2013, and it was in America.

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.700
 And it was a bakery guy who wanted to do a doughnut

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:53.140
 meets the croissant, and it took off massively straight away.

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:54.820
 So he released it on one day.

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.860
 The next day, there was a queue of 100 people

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:59.300
 trying to get access to the cronut.

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:02.300
 And the market value, the black market value

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.740
 of the cronut immediately was massive.

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:08.140
 So you would buy it for something like $2 or $3, $4 or $5, right?

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:09.940
 It was selling for like $100.

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:11.540
 There were people in alleyways.

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:13.460
 Yeah, it was such hot property.

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:14.300
 In alleyways.

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:15.140
 In alleyways in New York.

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:16.740
 You wouldn't buy a pastry in an alleyway.

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.860
 You would if it was a cronut.

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:20.820
 Because cronuts were, they were so popular.

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:23.620
 And so, it was a guy called Dominique Ansel,

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:25.260
 who was the creator of the cronut,

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.060
 and it was so popular that he trademarked it.

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:29.300
 So he owns it. No one else can make a cronut.

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:31.420
 They can. They just don't call it a cronut.

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:34.700
 Well, no, there's the doissant, which you can get.

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:36.100
 But you can't get the original.

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:39.140
 And so, yeah, but there was a huge black market value for it.

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:43.100
 God, people are stupid, aren't they?

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:44.780
 We should say, just because otherwise people

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:47.660
 are going to write in that, and I never thought I'd say this,

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:50.420
 James turns out to be the most sophisticated of the four of us

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:53.260
 in this one metric, because in France,

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.580
 they never put filling into their croissants.

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:57.940
 Which I didn't actually realise.

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:00.980
 But all Frenchers seem to concur on this.

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:03.140
 They say that they've literally never in their whole life

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:06.380
 met someone from France who puts jam or butter even worse

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:07.380
 on their croissants.

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:09.620
 Because it's got all the butter in it already.

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:10.820
 But it's only half butter.

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:13.060
 But people, it doesn't taste the same as when you melt

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:14.980
 the new layer of butter into it.

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:16.500
 I've got no patience with people who say

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.500
 there's enough butter in croissants already.

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.940
 You can never have enough butter.

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:24.060
 Do you know the Concorde du Mayor croissant de Grand Paris?

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:27.500
 This is the French croissant championships.

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:29.500
 Did you go for a French shirt?

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:30.620
 Sorry, I didn't mean to.

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:31.620
 I didn't mean to.

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:34.180
 But it's the most French thing you can imagine.

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:38.220
 So it's the greater Paris best class on competition, basically.

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:41.100
 And there was a brilliant National Geographic piece about it.

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.340
 The judge's comments are just so French.

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:44.340
 So listen to this one.

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:46.140
 "It's executed to perfection.

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:48.780
 "If Marie Antoinette had offered these to the French people,

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:50.820
 "there probably wouldn't have been a revolution."

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:56.940
 He also says at the beginning,

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:58.500
 "It's executed to perfection."

00:13:58.500 --> 00:13:59.500
 Which...

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.100
 LAUGHTER

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:10.980
 It is time for fact number two, and that is James.

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:14.500
 OK, my fact this week is that Manchester City women's football

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.100
 team has a menstrual cycle coach.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:19.100
 No.

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:22.620
 Is that a cycling coach who is also menstrual?

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:24.020
 LAUGHTER

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:25.300
 Or is it...?

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:29.180
 No, it's a coach to get the best out of their players

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:30.940
 when they're on their periods.

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:32.740
 Or in fact, for all different parts of the month.

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:35.620
 So this was an article I read in The Economist,

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:37.380
 and they were talking about this in general,

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:39.780
 and then I found out that Man City have this.

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:42.180
 But basically, I mean, it really makes sense, right?

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:44.460
 So if you're an elite sports person,

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:47.060
 you're really always aiming for that extra, like, 1%

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:49.580
 that'll just make you better than anyone else.

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:51.620
 And a load of studies have been done,

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:53.020
 and more and more are being done,

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:55.780
 that show that women's performance fluctuates

00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:57.940
 at different times of the month due to their cycle.

00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:00.620
 And so it really makes sense that you have someone on your team

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:03.380
 who can get the most out of your players by working that out.

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:06.620
 Oh, so it's not like you'll be hauled off halfway through a match

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:09.420
 because the cycle coach has looked at their watch and said,

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:11.100
 "No, she's on. Get her off."

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:12.500
 I should hope not. No, OK.

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:13.940
 I'm really hope that doesn't happen.

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:16.340
 I don't think it works like that, either, OK.

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:18.540
 LAUGHTER

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:23.300
 I've seen those adverts just roller-skated along.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:25.700
 LAUGHTER

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.860
 But this is the other thing that's really important,

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:32.180
 is that women footballers are way, way more likely

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:34.380
 to get certain injuries than male footballers, right?

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:37.100
 So there's a thing called the anterior cruciate ligament,

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:39.980
 and, like, football fans will know that this is something

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:41.660
 that plagues, like, male footballers,

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:43.820
 but it's really, really bad for women.

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:46.100
 And apparently women are eight times more likely

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:48.380
 to get an ACL injury than men.

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:51.460
 And a lot of people think that it's related to the menstrual cycle.

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:53.940
 So Arsenal midfielder Jordan Knobbs,

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:57.900
 she missed out of the 2019 World Cup because of her ACL,

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:00.860
 and she reckons it was because of the time of the month she was on,

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:02.100
 and that made her weaker.

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:05.180
 Yeah, apparently, basically, your menstrual cycle is split,

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:07.700
 not yours, but half of our menstrual cycles

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:09.660
 are split into essentially two phases,

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:12.140
 the follicular and the luteal phase.

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:15.580
 And in the late follicular phase,

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:18.340
 which I believe is week two, so you've had your period,

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:20.100
 and then it's kind of the week after that,

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:21.620
 that's when estrogen concentration is highest,

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:23.020
 and that's when you're just going to get injured,

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:26.900
 your bones are going to snap, your ligaments are going to break.

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:30.140
 You should basically stay in a padded room for a week,

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:31.500
 it turns out.

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:34.420
 Well, the thing is that estrogen is anabolic,

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:37.300
 so you'll know anabolic steroids that people take to build muscles,

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.220
 so estrogen helps muscle to build,

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:41.060
 so that's one difference that happens.

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:43.540
 But really what you do is you make sure that your diet

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:45.180
 is different at different times of the month.

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:47.420
 You can change your training so you can work harder

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:49.460
 at one time of the month and less harder at another time of the month,

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:51.620
 that's what they're kind of doing in city.

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:56.180
 I was also looking at other bits of sport science in women's football.

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:57.740
 I didn't realise the England women's team,

00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:00.380
 they have personalised bra prescriptions.

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:01.660
 - Did they? - Yeah, they did this year.

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:05.140
 They got in a breast biomechanics expert or two

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:08.540
 to provide very, very personalised bras

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:10.940
 - to ensure that they got the right, literally, the support they needed. - Really?

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:13.260
 Do you have to go into a chemist and they say,

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.180
 "We'll just make that up for you every 10 minutes?"

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:18.140
 You've got a seamstress in the back.

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:21.580
 The Guardian covered it and they said, "If those cups could talk..."

00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:24.260
 - Slightly creepy way of putting it. - LAUGHTER

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.380
 "They might claim a share of the lioness's victory for themselves."

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:30.580
 - Right. - But it genuinely makes a massive difference.

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:34.100
 And supposedly, if you run in a poorly-supportive bra,

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:37.060
 it can shorten a woman's stride by four centimetres.

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:39.260
 And that, and I'm going to need some help with this statistic,

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:42.460
 can add up to an extra mile over the length of a marathon.

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:44.180
 Now, that's what I read. I don't understand how...

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:46.900
 Does that mean when you get to everyone else's run 26 miles

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:48.540
 and you still have to do another mile?

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:50.420
 Well, that's what I don't understand.

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:53.700
 I think it means that you have to do more strides to do the marathon.

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.860
 - I see. - But I... Yeah.

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:59.020
 I don't think it means that you get to finish early.

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:01.620
 I like, with the lionesses, there's so many...

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:04.460
 Like, superstition is a big thing within footballers,

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:06.460
 where they have to follow certain routines.

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:08.940
 We see it in sports where, like, Serena Williams

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:12.380
 will wear the same pair of socks throughout a competition.

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:14.500
 If she plays Wimbledon, she'll wear the same pair of socks,

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:17.740
 just so it makes it sort of feel like she'll win, that sort of thing.

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:21.180
 With the lionesses, there's one player who always needs to have beans on toast.

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:23.620
 That's her thing. She thinks, "That's going to help me."

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:26.380
 - Okay. - It's just routine, and it's what they do.

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:28.260
 And then another thing was, there was one match

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:32.060
 where a few of them had a ponytail that was done by one of the players,

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:33.540
 and they had a great game.

00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:36.380
 They started believing that this ponytail was part of the sort of...

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:39.140
 Who the hell needs someone else to do their ponytails?

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:41.340
 I've seen the ponytails of the England women's team.

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:43.380
 They're pretty basic ponytails.

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:47.140
 When the Euros were on earlier this year,

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:51.900
 the Guardian newspaper had biographies of all 368 players.

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:54.300
 - Okay. - So I read all of those.

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:57.020
 - Nice. - And I'll be honest,

00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:59.100
 there wasn't that much in there.

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:03.420
 So Lena McGull, who plays for Germany, this is her fun fact.

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:08.700
 She was born exactly 225 days to the day after Napoleon Bonaparte.

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:10.540
 225 days?

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:12.380
 - Yes. - Yes.

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:15.780
 - She's very fit for her age. - She's very, very old.

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:21.100
 - Wow. - She will only have got croissants since the 1970s.

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:26.020
 She was 200 years older. She's like, "What is this?"

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:29.860
 Marie-Leon, let's see if I can get this one right. She's Spanish.

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:33.220
 She has lots of tattoos, but they're only on her left arm.

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:35.460
 Can you work out why they're only on her left arm?

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:37.460
 She right-handed, but she's a tattoo artist.

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:40.260
 - Correct. - Oh, wow!

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:44.100
 That's really good. And another one, Viviane May Diemer,

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.780
 who's from the Netherlands.

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:48.940
 She always got upset because people called her the goat.

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:51.220
 - So goat means greatest of all time. - Yeah.

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:54.900
 But she didn't know that's what it meant.

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:57.980
 And she just said, "A goat is not the best animal to be."

00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:00.980
 Why are they calling me a goat?

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:03.940
 - That's so good. - I love that.

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:08.260
 So we mentioned ages and ages ago, there was a band, the English FA,

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:11.220
 they banned women's football in about 1920, didn't they?

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:13.420
 - 21, I think, yes. - They banned women from playing on their pictures,

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:14.740
 which effectively banned it.

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:16.260
 So it sort of shut down the game.

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:18.260
 But this happened all over Europe.

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:20.580
 So the French game was their football federation.

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:22.540
 They banned it in 1933.

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:25.100
 West Germany, 1955.

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:28.340
 Spain, 1930, to '75, it was banned.

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:31.020
 Or it was banned in the '20s and '30s,

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:35.260
 and then all the bans were lifted in about the very late '60s or early '70s.

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:37.380
 - Yeah. - Yeah. It's just very peculiar.

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:39.100
 Yeah, it is very weird.

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:42.020
 Although some sort of underground matches did happen,

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:44.700
 socially underground, not literally underground,

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:46.140
 in the interim.

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:48.820
 And I think there was...

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:50.540
 It was the early 1970s, as you say,

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:53.460
 that it started to come back into the mainstream again.

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:57.940
 And there was the Unofficial Women's World Cup in Italy in 1970.

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:01.260
 And I think FIFA refused to play a part in that, but it did happen.

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:02.300
 And it was quite popular.

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:04.980
 And then there was a follow-up in Mexico in '71.

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:06.580
 And it was really popular.

00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:11.020
 So I had no idea. The final, in 1971, had a crowd of 110,000,

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:12.940
 which I think is the biggest women's crowd ever.

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:15.660
 And there have been claims made about similar crowds recently,

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:17.140
 but I think that's bigger than all of them.

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:18.420
 - Yeah, that's right. - Amazing.

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:20.980
 Yeah, and it was great.

00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:22.740
 It was sponsored by Martini.

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:26.340
 So I guess you got free shots of fortified wine

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:29.180
 given out to you, the classic football drink.

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:31.780
 And to make it...

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:36.340
 Weirdly, to make it appeal more to the female audience, I guess,

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:39.620
 they painted the gold frames with pink and white

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:42.140
 and all the stadium stuff with pink outfits.

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:43.220
 No, there's an intake of breath,

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:45.420
 but I do think that pink gets a bad reputation

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:48.260
 because it's not an objectively bad colour.

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:50.660
 But, yeah.

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:53.620
 It feels like a bad colour for a football goal, though, right?

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:55.700
 A nice bright white is what you want.

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:58.620
 - That's probably the most contrast, isn't it? - Yeah.

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:00.500
 Better than painting it green.

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:03.500
 I read about what I think might be the earliest example

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:05.260
 of a woman playing football.

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:07.300
 It was this woman who was born just after Napalm.

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:08.820
 No, it wasn't.

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:11.500
 It was in 1773 in Yorkshire,

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:13.980
 and it was a match between the married gentlemen

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:18.180
 of the town of Walton and the bachelors of the town of Walton.

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:19.740
 And it said in the report, it said,

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:23.220
 "The game had many falls and broken shins on each side,

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:25.700
 "and at one stage, the wife of one of the married men

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:27.900
 "went to help him after he was injured.

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:29.340
 "She then went after the ball

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:31.940
 "and secured victory for her husband's team."

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:33.460
 Oh.

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:36.420
 It doesn't count, though, really, it's an illegal move, isn't it?

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:39.900
 - Kind of a random play, I don't know. - I'm stumbling from the ground.

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:43.180
 Women's football basically has, just until recently,

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:48.060
 had just terrible, even internally from the football community,

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:50.660
 particularly the officials, just terrible times.

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:55.540
 1991, FIFA didn't want to name the women's World Cup the World Cup.

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:59.820
 So instead, they got a sponsor, so it was the M&M's Cup.

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:03.020
 They could have named it after Mars bars and called it the Mars Cups.

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:05.460
 - You have the World Cup and the Mars Cup. - Oh, yeah!

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:08.580
 - And then they could have done an intergalactic match against each other. - Exactly.

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:11.900
 - Yeah, Solar Cup. - And those games, they made the games 10 minutes shorter.

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:13.820
 - Yeah. - Just in case the women collapsed

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:15.780
 when playing for the full 90 minutes.

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:17.500
 - Yeah, yeah. - That seems to be the reasoning.

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:19.260
 - That was 1991, right? - Yeah, yeah.

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:22.700
 And when West Germany listed its ban in 1970,

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:24.740
 the games were only 70 minutes long,

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:28.020
 and they were only allowed to be played in warm weather.

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:30.660
 - It's crazy. - Basically, just in case Cold Weather

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:34.700
 - killed the players. - Yeah, that seems to be the panic that there was.

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:40.420
 And Seth Blatter, who is the president of FIFA, right?

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:43.380
 He was asked about women's football, this was a while ago,

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:45.980
 - and he suggested that... - He was a very progressive man,

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:50.180
 so I'm looking forward to an extremely liberal and thoughtful comment here.

00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:53.020
 I hope we're not going to tarnish the good name of Seth Blatter in this room.

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:54.380
 Really not!

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:59.100
 He said that he suggested to get more people watching women's football

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:01.740
 that female players should wear tighter shorts

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:05.100
 to promote a more female aesthetic.

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:07.660
 He said they could, for example, have tighter shorts.

00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:12.580
 Female players are pretty, if you excuse me, for saying so.

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:14.700
 And they already have some different rules to men,

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:16.980
 such as playing with a lighter ball.

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:19.220
 They don't play with a lighter ball.

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:21.420
 You did used to be there, you used to be playing with kids' balls.

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:23.860
 In Japan, when they started playing women's football in the 80s,

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:26.220
 they played with a children's ball, I think,

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:29.540
 and the halves lasted 25 minutes,

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:34.540
 and handballs were permissible if it was players protecting their own breasts,

00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:36.180
 which I actually think is a fine rule.

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:39.980
 I'm going to need to move us on in a second.

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:42.780
 I was looking at world records for Keepey Uppies.

00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:43.780
 Oh, yeah.

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:47.700
 Because in 2003, there was a woman called Milen Dominguez,

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:49.660
 who's quite a famous-age footballer.

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:53.900
 She's the ex-wife of Ronaldo, not the Ronaldo that you would know, Andy,

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:55.580
 but the Ronaldo that football fans would know.

00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:59.380
 Oh, it's so nice that you presume I know any of the Ronaldo's.

00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:01.180
 I'm really, like, I'm quite proud of it.

00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:07.420
 Anyway, she was 17 at the time, and she did 55,187 Keepey Uppies,

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:09.300
 which was a world record.

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:11.380
 Now, according to the Guinness Book of Records,

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:13.940
 the current world record was made in 2009.

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:16.260
 It was by a British guy called Dan Magnus,

00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:19.940
 and he did 24 hours of Keepey Uppies in Covent Garden.

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:21.900
 He did over 200,000 touches.

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:22.900
 What?

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:26.420
 But he was allowed a few breaks to kind of stretch his legs

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:28.060
 and stretch his muscles and stuff,

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:30.900
 whereas Milen Dominguez didn't have any breaks.

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:32.500
 And whenever she needed to do anything,

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:35.540
 whenever she needed to eat, drink or go to the toilet,

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:38.460
 she did it by balancing the ball on the back of her neck

00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:41.460
 and then backing up and sitting down and doing it.

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:43.420
 So I reckon she should still have the record.

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:44.420
 Oh, my God.

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:45.420
 That's amazing.

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:46.420
 I think I will just have a main, actually.

00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:47.420
 I'm going to skip the starter.

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:48.420
 Thank you very much.

00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:49.420
 Wow.

00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:52.460
 And then there was a 12-year-old called Imogen Papwerth Heidel,

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:56.980
 who last year did 7.1 million Keepey Uppies.

00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:57.980
 Sorry?

00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:00.780
 But she had a lot of them donated by other people.

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:05.700
 So the idea was that she was going to do one for every key worker

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:08.420
 in the UK after, you know, COVID stuff.

00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:12.220
 And she, in fairness, she did, like, over a million

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:13.900
 over a long period of time.

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:17.100
 But the rest were donated by Marcus Rashford, Lucy Bronze,

00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:19.380
 and Spandau Balleig star, Martin Kemp.

00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:20.380
 Oh, cool.

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:22.380
 Go, Martin.

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:26.380
 It's been a joy patch since he left his standards, hasn't it?

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:36.380
 It is time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:40.340
 My fact this week is that two of the leading archaeologists

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:43.340
 to dig up King Richard III's bones

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:46.220
 were called King and Richard.

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:48.220
 (LAUGHTER)

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:51.260
 So, a slight correction of my fact.

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:53.780
 One was an archaeologist, another was a geneticist,

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:56.860
 and this was two people called Richard Buckley,

00:26:56.860 --> 00:27:00.020
 who's of the University of Leicester Archaeological Services,

00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:02.980
 and Professor Turi King, who's the geneticist,

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:06.220
 who was the person who went and did all of the DNA testing

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:08.860
 to prove that Richard III was who he was.

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:11.980
 So can I just say, Dan, like, maybe about two months ago,

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:15.380
 you did another fact, which was that someone from the movie

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:17.060
 King Richard was called Richard King?

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:19.820
 Yeah, the editor of the movie.

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:22.220
 Are you just looking up Richard King's?

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:23.940
 (LAUGHTER)

00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:24.940
 It's my new hobby.

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:28.420
 I'm just trying to find anyone called Richard or King.

00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:32.140
 So the big story that I'm sure everyone remembers,

00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:34.540
 episode one of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:38.580
 in which we mentioned that the reason that King Richard III

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:41.100
 was found was because there was a screenwriter called

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:43.500
 Philippa Langley, who was doing some research

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:45.220
 for the script that she was going to write.

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:46.660
 She was walking through Leicester.

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:49.620
 She passed a car park, and she had a sudden feeling

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:51.780
 that Richard was there.

00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:54.300
 And so she went away, and she told her friends,

00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:56.300
 and she was like, "I just felt like he was there."

00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:58.660
 And she kept telling this story, and eventually she thought,

00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:00.220
 "I'm going to go back and check if he's there."

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:03.300
 She goes back a year later, she walks into the car park.

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:06.260
 This time, she sees something that wasn't there last time,

00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:10.140
 which is a giant R, which is painted onto the ground,

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:12.460
 which she thinks is like a helicopter sign,

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:14.700
 which just means Richard is here.

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:18.340
 And so she puts forward a plan to Richard Buckley,

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:20.060
 who I've just mentioned, saying,

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:21.860
 "I'd like to get a dig going here,"

00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:23.420
 and she helped to raise the funds.

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:25.340
 Anyway, the story is that they found the King

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:27.620
 underneath the R, but recently,

00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:29.860
 while I was trying to do some research on a photo,

00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:32.500
 a friend of mine was in touch with Tourie King,

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.140
 Professor Tourie King, and she said,

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:36.260
 "Oh, you're not getting in touch about the R

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:38.100
 "underneath where he was found,"

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:40.540
 because he wasn't found underneath the R.

00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:42.420
 So that's been a big story.

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:45.100
 So I thought, okay, because probably it's very annoying

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:46.940
 as an archaeologist or a geneticist

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:49.540
 that when you've used actual science to find

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:52.380
 remains of a body, that someone else is claiming

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:55.580
 that they use psychic intuition to find it.

00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:57.900
 But then, she doesn't acknowledge the fact

00:28:57.900 --> 00:28:59.980
 that there's huge synchronicity in the point

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:02.620
 that Richard and King, these two people,

00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:03.900
 found the fucking body.

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:05.140
 Yeah, yeah.

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:09.100
 And there's a third incredible nomenclature link

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:10.100
 to this, Dan.

00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:13.060
 So after the bones of Richard the Third were found,

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:14.460
 they were then reinterred.

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:16.420
 There was a big ceremony for the reburial

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:18.300
 of Richard the Third, and the man who made

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:20.940
 the lead-lined casket that the King was put in

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:23.860
 was called John Castleman.

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:27.260
 And what is a king, if not a man?

00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:28.860
 Wow.

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:30.020
 Who lives in a castle.

00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:31.340
 So true.

00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:32.740
 And isn't that spooky?

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:34.820
 Haven't the hairs on the back of your neck gone up?

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:35.660
 Yeah.

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:37.580
 There's one interesting sort of spooky thing

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:39.060
 about Richard the Third,

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:40.980
 and that is that there's, I only learned this

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:42.660
 by doing this research this week,

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:43.980
 and that is that there's a theory

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:46.060
 that Leicester City won the Premier League

00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:48.500
 with the help from Richard the Third's ghost.

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:50.060
 Oh, yes.

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:51.700
 And on the Leicester City website,

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:54.340
 they have a lot of evidence as to why this is the case.

00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:55.180
 Really?

00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:57.260
 So they won the league, but the season before,

00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:58.540
 they were bottom of the league,

00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:00.620
 and they, you know, it was about Christmas,

00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:02.380
 and they'd lost, lost, lost, lost, lost.

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:06.380
 And then, they laid Richard the Third to rest,

00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:08.260
 and nine days later, their next game

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:09.820
 was against West Ham,

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:12.780
 and they won that game with a last-minute goal

00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:14.580
 by Andy King.

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:15.700
 No!

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:17.420
 Dun, dun, dun.

00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:18.540
 This is ridiculous.

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:19.780
 And Richard was actually,

00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:22.660
 he went from the bottom of the car park to the top,

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:24.660
 didn't he, when they dug him up?

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:25.500
 So it's awful.

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:26.340
 I feel like I've got to...

00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:27.660
 I'll just tell you from the Leicester City website,

00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:28.940
 that's all, that's amazing.

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:30.500
 I'm at a conspiracy theorist meeting,

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:32.260
 and it's freaking me out.

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:34.060
 I just want to mention something that I like

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:36.820
 about Cheery King that she discovered.

00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:38.180
 So, as you say, she's a geneticist,

00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:39.580
 so she was one who said,

00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:40.900
 "Look, this is Richard the Third,"

00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:43.940
 and the DNA match was made by comparing people

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:46.860
 who had descended from his mother's side of the family

00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:49.500
 to his DNA, but she then thought,

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:51.940
 "Okay, let's just check out the other side of the family."

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:53.780
 And they...

00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:56.980
 First of all, she and her team of geneticists,

00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:59.380
 they got relations of Henry Somerset,

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:02.620
 who was descended from the same great-great-grandfather

00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:05.820
 as Richard the Third, so they'd have to share DNA.

00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:07.780
 They got people who were related to Henry Somerset,

00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:11.820
 and it turned out they didn't match Richard the Third at all,

00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:12.820
 which is very weird.

00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:14.820
 It means there must have been a break somewhere

00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:16.820
 in the line of succession,

00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:18.820
 and so that's incredibly weird.

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:20.820
 Does that mean someone was cheating and stuff?

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:23.820
 It means that we suspect there's been some hanky-panky,

00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:25.580
 and then there's also another guy today

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:27.500
 who's descended from Geoffrey Count of Anjou,

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:30.420
 who's basically the founder of the Plantagenet dynasty,

00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:32.020
 and he's who it was named after,

00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:35.100
 and that person's DNA doesn't match either of the other two's.

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:37.300
 So, basically, everyone in this dynasty

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:39.700
 was shacking around different centres, as far as I can tell.

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:42.540
 That's really cool. Richard the Third himself.

00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:46.100
 He was born with a full set of teeth,

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:49.180
 and he was in the womb for two years.

00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:51.380
 What? Come on. Wow!

00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:52.500
 That can't be true.

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:56.980
 Well, these might be propaganda claims from the era.

00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:59.580
 Yeah, in fact, there's Shakespearean propaganda claims.

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:02.700
 I think it's in the play that he was born with a full set of teeth.

00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:05.340
 Are they pro or anti in propaganda terms?

00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:07.380
 What is it? Does it sound like a compliment?

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:08.380
 What do you think?

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:09.380
 That's pretty cool.

00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:11.580
 If you've bought a full set of teeth and you're in a mum's...

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:12.580
 Yeah, that's pretty cool.

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:15.980
 And heard his shoulders as well, he was born with.

00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:18.860
 And it wasn't... I think Shakespeare took it from historians

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:24.340
 who immediately after Richard died were coming up with this slander.

00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:25.780
 Or maybe it was true, we don't know.

00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:28.140
 It's probably untrue, though.

00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:30.700
 Can I just want to say one good thing about Richard the Third?

00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:33.180
 Because he gets a bad rep for justifiably.

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:35.420
 He was probably a murderer of small boys.

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:38.420
 But on the bright side,

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:42.180
 he did introduce England's first legal aid system,

00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:43.460
 which I didn't know.

00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:45.460
 Yeah, so he instigated in his...

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:47.580
 What was a very short reign?

00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:49.380
 He was only on the throne about two years, wasn't he?

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:50.380
 - Was he? - Yeah.

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:52.260
 Same time he was in the womb. That's insane.

00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:56.580
 But yeah, he instigated this thing called the Court of Request.

00:32:56.580 --> 00:33:00.140
 That meant that if you couldn't afford legal aid or legal representation,

00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:02.140
 then you could get it. It would be provided by the state.

00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:03.460
 It was very ahead of its time.

00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:04.460
 - Yeah. - That's pretty cool.

00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:05.980
 He founded a council of the North

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:08.100
 to ensure that the North got representation in government.

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:09.300
 - Great. - Yep.

00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:12.300
 The only Northern king, really, that we've ever had.

00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:14.260
 - A proper Northerner. - I got a really good fact,

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:15.820
 which I didn't look up, so it might be wrong.

00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:20.140
 But it's so nice to set the expectations

00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:22.020
 at the beginning of a damn thing.

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:26.060
 So the third word of the third scene,

00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:30.100
 of the third act, of Richard the Third,

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:31.100
 is fourth.

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:38.100
 [LAUGHTER]

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:40.100
 I love that fact. That's so good.

00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:41.100
 - If it's true. - If it's true.

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:43.100
 [LAUGHTER]

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:45.100
 Have you guys heard of Marmaduke Constable?

00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:46.100
 That sounds great, though.

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:50.100
 We were just on, like, relatives of Richard the Third,

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:53.100
 and this is one of the really close descendants of Richard the Third,

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:55.100
 as in almost contemporary.

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:56.100
 In fact, he was contemporary.

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:58.100
 He was, yeah, his name was Marmaduke Bosworth.

00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:01.100
 He fought at the Battle of Bosworth, where Richard was killed.

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:05.100
 He also, and that was the year 1485, just to say,

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:08.100
 he also fought against the Scots at the Battle of Northumberland.

00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:09.100
 That was in 1513.

00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:14.100
 He was aged 71 when he took actively part in that battle.

00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:18.100
 He only died in 1518, aged about 75 years old,

00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:21.100
 when he choked to death drinking a glass of water

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:22.100
 which had a frog in it.

00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:26.100
 [LAUGHTER]

00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:30.100
 So Richard the Third died, like you say, in the Battle of Bosworth.

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:32.100
 We've found, you know, we've checked the bones,

00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:34.100
 and we reckon that he lost his helmet

00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:37.100
 and came under a hail of 11 wounds at the same time,

00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:38.100
 and that's what did him in.

00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:40.100
 But traditionally, he's supposed to have been killed

00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:43.100
 by a soldier called Ralph Rudyard.

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:46.100
 Ralph Rudyard's family went on to own a lake in Staffordshire

00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:48.100
 called Rudyard Lake.

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:50.100
 Rudyard Lake, we've said before,

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:53.100
 is where Rudyard Kipling's name comes from.

00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:56.100
 Right, so his parents went there and they really loved it,

00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:58.100
 and they thought we'll name him after the lake.

00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:01.100
 So Ralph Rudyard's family owned this Rudyard Lake,

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:03.100
 but they owned two lakes in the area,

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:05.100
 one on each side of a hill.

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:08.100
 Rudyard Lake and another one called Titty's Worth.

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:10.100
 [LAUGHTER]

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:12.100
 So that means that Rudyard Kipling

00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:15.100
 could so easily have been called Titty's Worth Kipling.

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:18.100
 [LAUGHTER]

00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:20.100
 That's really great.

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:22.100
 Can I quickly go back to Cherry King a second?

00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:23.100
 Yeah, sure.

00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:25.100
 I just want to say there's been an interesting thing

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:27.100
 that's been in the news recently.

00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:29.100
 So there's actually a movie that's just been made.

00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:32.100
 Steve Coogan has made a movie of the story

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:35.100
 of Philippa Langley finding Richard III,

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:38.100
 and in it, the sort of plot line is that

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:40.100
 she has this psychic intuition,

00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:43.100
 and the scientists and archaeologists and geneticists in it

00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:45.100
 are kind of portrayed in that classic way

00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:48.100
 of being really rational and really unkind,

00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:50.100
 and they're really pissed off because they weren't.

00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:53.100
 And if you watch Cherry King, just in case you see that movie

00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:55.100
 and you think, oh, scientists are bad, she's awesome.

00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:56.100
 She's really cool.

00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:58.100
 She's found incredible stuff as a geneticist.

00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:01.100
 So she goes around doing DNA for all these finds.

00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:03.100
 When she was trying to find out about Vikings,

00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:07.100
 she found that many men just came in to give their DNA,

00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:11.100
 because apparently most men think they're Viking.

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:12.100
 That's the thing.

00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:15.100
 She was like, there was no trouble getting volunteers

00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:16.100
 for people saying, are you Viking?

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:18.100
 Because people are coming and going, well, I definitely am.

00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:19.100
 So let's prove this.

00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:21.100
 Are we sure that a lot of men didn't do it because they thought,

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:24.100
 maybe they'll give me an iPad and some free porn for half an hour.

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:26.100
 And that's how I'm donating my DNA.

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:28.100
 Was that how you donate your DNA?

00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:29.100
 I don't think so.

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:30.100
 I thought it was a cheek swab.

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:32.100
 I'm saying that's what they thought.

00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:33.100
 OK.

00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:35.100
 Well, thank God you clarified that.

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:38.100
 Otherwise, you would have been straight down there.

00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:40.100
 Yeah, and if I'm giving you a call when I'm in jail,

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:42.100
 because I took my dick out during a...

00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:44.100
 It was meant to be a cheek swab.

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:47.100
 Swab this cheek.

00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:49.100
 LAUGHTER

00:36:49.100 --> 00:37:00.100
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show,

00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:02.100
 and that is Andy.

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:05.100
 My fact is that to establish dominance,

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:07.100
 the sarcastic fringe-head fish

00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:11.100
 will engage in kissing competitions with rival males.

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:14.100
 And here's the fish.

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:18.100
 So there's a picture of it on the screen here.

00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:20.100
 The sarcastic fringe fish.

00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:22.100
 The sarcastic fringe-head.

00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:24.100
 They're really bizarre fish.

00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:25.100
 Oh, I should give credit for this.

00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:27.100
 This was actually sent in to us by @FlockOfWords online,

00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:29.100
 so thank you so much.

00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:31.100
 They're called Neoclinus Blanchardi.

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:34.100
 They live off North America on the Pacific side,

00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:37.100
 and they're really ugly-looking.

00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:39.100
 They're kind of tiny, little brown fish,

00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:41.100
 and they live in holes, and they jump out,

00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:43.100
 and they go, "Wah!" at their prey,

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:46.100
 like they're kind of these gross, awful fish.

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:48.100
 But the one amazing and beautiful thing about them,

00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:50.100
 they have this enormous mouth,

00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:52.100
 as in their mouth is wider than the entire body,

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:55.100
 because it's got these huge sort of supporting struts,

00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:57.100
 and they've got big, flappy cheeks,

00:37:57.100 --> 00:37:59.100
 and they can just sort of go, "Wah!"

00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:00.100
 Sounds beautiful.

00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:03.100
 It's a bit like just to give a visual to the audience.

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:05.100
 It's a bit like, even though it's part of their mouth,

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:09.100
 you remember in Jurassic Park when the dinosaur comes up

00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:11.100
 and it suddenly looks, it's looking cute,

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:13.100
 and it spreads those frills.

00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:16.100
 It's kind of like that, except that's its mouth, not its frills.

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:17.100
 It's really like that.

00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:19.100
 And they have this weird, weird ritual

00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:22.100
 where if they are near a rival male,

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:24.100
 and it's the mating season,

00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:26.100
 they will both yawn open

00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:28.100
 and kind of push their mouths against each other

00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:30.100
 to see who's got the bigger mouth,

00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:32.100
 and this is the intimidating thing.

00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:35.100
 In my experience, that's not what kissing is.

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:39.100
 Maybe I'm doing it wrong,

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:43.100
 but it's not always like, "Let's see who has the biggest mouth."

00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:45.100
 Well, I've got some apologies to make

00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:49.100
 because I'm, like, undefeated champion.

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:53.100
 And the smaller male,

00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:55.100
 or the male with the smaller mouth, rather,

00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:56.100
 will surrender and leave.

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:58.100
 And they do, but they basically are sort of...

00:38:58.100 --> 00:38:59.100
 But it does.

00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:01.100
 Because they're both about the same size,

00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:03.100
 it does look like they kind of make it out.

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:05.100
 So it's not proper, proper kissing.

00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:09.100
 If one has a smaller head, sometimes the bigger mouth

00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:12.100
 will be able to fit the smaller one's head inside its mouth.

00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:13.100
 Oh, my God, really?

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:15.100
 Which is my memory of year nine discos.

00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:21.100
 One thing I couldn't get to the bottom of is,

00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:23.100
 so they do the mouth display,

00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:25.100
 the sort of dominance thing.

00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:27.100
 If they were to have a fight, then,

00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:30.100
 off the back of that, like, let's now have a fight,

00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:33.100
 what is the advantage of having a bigger mouth?

00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:35.100
 Other than, obviously, they're a bit bigger,

00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:37.100
 but does that mean that they're going to win in a fight?

00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:39.100
 Not really. They actually almost never have an actual fight.

00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:40.100
 Yeah.

00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:42.100
 They will slightly, they might slightly bump into each other,

00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:44.100
 but that's just not the way they do it,

00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:45.100
 as in it's not in their repertoire.

00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:47.100
 It's just like basically going at a year nine disco

00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:50.100
 to another guy and then doing your muscles and saying,

00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:51.100
 "Look, my muscles are bigger than you,

00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:53.100
 but I really don't want to fight you."

00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:54.100
 OK.

00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:57.100
 You guys had crazy year nine discos, you and Anna.

00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:59.100
 I can't believe you guys went to the year nine disco.

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:01.100
 I wasn't allowed to go, and I...

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:04.100
 Good news is, it sounds like I missed nothing at all.

00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:10.100
 But they do, I mean, these jaws, they have quite sharp teeth,

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:12.100
 so they can kind of bite and hurt you,

00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:15.100
 but they just tend not to do it to each other.

00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:17.100
 Like, if you go near their house,

00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:20.100
 they'll do this kind of sort of scary, big, open mouth thing,

00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:23.100
 but then, if you don't go away, they'll actually go for you,

00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:25.100
 and they are, you know, they do have a hefty bite on them.

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:27.100
 Yeah, they'll bite humans, won't they,

00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:29.100
 when you say you, actually you, divers?

00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:31.100
 And that's where sarcastic comes from, by the way,

00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:33.100
 'cause we think, you know, does it have, like,

00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:36.100
 some sort of, like, is it like the Anna Tyshinski of fish?

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:40.100
 But no, it's sarcastic means that it's a Greek word,

00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:43.100
 sarcasmos, and to bite or tear...

00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:44.100
 Oh, is that right?

00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:45.100
 Yeah.

00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:46.100
 Yeah, right.

00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:48.100
 It does.

00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:51.100
 It comes from, I think, Sarko, its flesh.

00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:52.100
 So it's to...

00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:55.100
 And so, sarcasmain or whatever, to bite flesh.

00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:57.100
 And it's where we get sarcophagus,

00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:58.100
 which I'd never thought about,

00:40:58.100 --> 00:41:01.100
 but sarcophagus, Sarko is flesh,

00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:04.100
 and then faggo, faggo, so it means eat, I eat.

00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:06.100
 So it's flesh-eating.

00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:08.100
 A sarcophagus is something that's eating your flesh.

00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:09.100
 Ah.

00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:10.100
 Gross.

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:15.100
 They have these kind of bright yellow lips, don't they?

00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:17.100
 The people in here can see them just about, I think,

00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:19.100
 but for the people at home,

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:21.100
 you kind of have really bright yellow lips,

00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:23.100
 and then on the inside, it's kind of a little bit colourful,

00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:24.100
 but not really.

00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:27.100
 But in actual fact, those bits on the inside of the mouth

00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:29.100
 reflect ultraviolet light.

00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:32.100
 So to anyone under the sea that can see ultraviolet light,

00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:34.100
 which is a lot and a lot of fish can see it,

00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:37.100
 actually, that also looks like there's a massive sort of disco

00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:38.100
 coming out of his mouth.

00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:40.100
 Right.

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:41.100
 They are so cool.

00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:42.100
 It does look...

00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:44.100
 I think that it's very beautiful with its mouth open.

00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:45.100
 It looks like...

00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:47.100
 It really reminds me of having your face painted at a fair.

00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:51.100
 It looks like a kid's gone mad with face paint on them.

00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:55.100
 Their mouths are so big that it's possible they struggle to eat.

00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:57.100
 And that sounds bizarre.

00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:58.100
 Really?

00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:00.100
 They're a particular kind of fish called a blenny.

00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:02.100
 There's a huge, great family of fish.

00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:05.100
 And they are tube blenny, which live in tubes.

00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:08.100
 And most tube blenny feed on small plankton.

00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:10.100
 But the male sarcastic fringe head,

00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:13.100
 its mouth is so big that it can't suck anymore.

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:17.100
 So it seems to struggle a bit sometimes to eat plankton.

00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:20.100
 It's sort of filtered in because it's just got this huge grip.

00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:21.100
 Yes.

00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:22.100
 It's like when your...

00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:25.100
 If your toilet's clogged and you need to use a plunger,

00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:29.100
 but sometimes the plunger head is too big to get suction on the actual whole bit.

00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:31.100
 And so it's a pointless suction plan.

00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:36.100
 I don't think anyone was actually struggling to grip the original point.

00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:38.100
 But thank you so much.

00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:40.100
 Glad to help.

00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:42.100
 But now all you've done is connected our minds,

00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:44.100
 opening our mouths with a blocked toilet.

00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:46.100
 And we've all gone to the same place.

00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:47.100
 Blenny's not...

00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:48.100
 Yeah, they're a huge family, aren't they?

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:51.100
 There are so many cool fish in the blenny family.

00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:56.100
 But one of the things they have is they have the only fish that suckles its young.

00:42:56.100 --> 00:43:01.100
 So the only thing on our show that suckles like we do, yeah, the Viviparis eel pout.

00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:06.100
 So Viviparis being, you know, they give birth to live young, hence that name.

00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:10.100
 But when they're pregnant and they have six-month-long pregnancies, which is pretty...

00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:12.100
 Oh, it's a quarter the length of Richard the Third.

00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:14.100
 Yeah, absolutely, yeah.

00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:16.100
 Is that long for a fish?

00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:17.100
 It's long, yeah, yeah.

00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:18.100
 It's good for a fish.

00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:21.100
 Usually the bigger the animal, the longer the gestation period.

00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:23.100
 OK, and these are like 30 centimetres, right?

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:24.100
 Yeah, yeah, they're long.

00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:29.100
 But the way they suckle is inside, they sort of live in the ovaries.

00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:30.100
 They don't have a separate uterus.

00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:32.100
 And they've got ovarian follicles.

00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:37.100
 And each little fish embryo suckles on a follicle, one inside the fish.

00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:39.100
 And there are up to 400 of them.

00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:44.100
 So imagine it's like you've got 400 breasts and a baby on every one in there.

00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:45.100
 Wow!

00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:46.100
 That's amazing.

00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:48.100
 A massive mouth, yeah.

00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:49.100
 Yeah.

00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:53.100
 There was a website called World Wide Words, I don't know if you guys have seen it.

00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:55.100
 It's online, it's a really, really good website.

00:43:55.100 --> 00:44:00.100
 They've collected a list of animals with names that are suggestive of emotion,

00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:03.100
 of which the sarcastic fringe head is one of them.

00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:07.100
 So there's a few here, the festive midget.

00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:11.100
 That's the species of moth that's found in North America.

00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:14.100
 The confused flower beetle.

00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:19.100
 That's confused because it looks a bit like another kind of beetle,

00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:22.100
 not just walking around, not knowing what's going on.

00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:24.100
 And the depressed mussel.

00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:25.100
 Wow!

00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:27.100
 They call that because they have a flat shell.

00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:30.100
 All mussels seem kind of depressed to me.

00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:34.100
 I mostly see them actually on a plate, so that doesn't make sense.

00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:36.100
 Have you heard of the tetra fish?

00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:40.100
 I'm just going on general fish mating and aggression displays now.

00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:41.100
 Tetra fish is unbelievable.

00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:43.100
 Sailfin tetras.

00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:47.100
 So there are dominant males, and there are also smaller, more feeble males.

00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:50.100
 Both of them are competing for the attention of females.

00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:54.100
 The dominant ones, you would think, they're very active.

00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:56.100
 In fact, they do nothing.

00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:59.100
 They hide in some sort of kelp.

00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:01.100
 Kelp, thank you.

00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:02.100
 They just hide.

00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:05.100
 So the low-ranking males have the run of the place, right?

00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:07.100
 And they do all these mating displays.

00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:10.100
 And they're trying to persuade the female that they're a good prospect

00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:12.100
 and they're good to have sex with.

00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:16.100
 And they do days and days of work persuading the female to have sex, right?

00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:19.100
 And when they have finally got the female to agree,

00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:22.100
 and they're going off to the mating zone,

00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:25.100
 a more dominant male will just emerge from the kelp

00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:29.100
 and say, "Thank you very much. I'll take it from here."

00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:32.100
 And the female just goes off with him every time.

00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:35.100
 She's like, "Right, I'm now in the mood, and here's an even better offer."

00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:37.100
 That was my urinine disco.

00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:41.100
 And this is a thing called courtship piracy.

00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:44.100
 And the dominant males are just finding good hiding places

00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:47.100
 right near the mating zone, and then just popping out of the last minute.

00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:50.100
 Why do they keep doing it, the little nerd ones?

00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:52.100
 They just accept it. It's so weird.

00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:53.100
 They never fight.

00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:55.100
 Well, maybe occasionally they get lucky.

00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:56.100
 Yeah, exactly.

00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:59.100
 Yeah, they must hope that somewhere in the kelp there's no...

00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:02.100
 It must just be like kind of looking in all the kelp and stuff.

00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:04.100
 There's definitely none there.

00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:06.100
 Exactly, yeah.

00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:10.100
 Female brown trouts, they fake orgasms.

00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:11.100
 Oh, yeah.

00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:13.100
 So it's kind of a similar thing.

00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:18.100
 So what will happen is, if a male and a female trouter are having sex,

00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:21.100
 by which I mean one laying eggs and the other one spawning over it,

00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:25.100
 then another male or other males might come in the area.

00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:27.100
 They might kind of turn up and say, "I want a bit of that."

00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:30.100
 Would you say, "Come in the area?" Do you mean they might?

00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:32.100
 We might get to that.

00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:37.100
 So what they'll often do is the female brown trout will kind of meet up with a male,

00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:40.100
 who she's kind of not sure about, she's kind of fancies but not sure,

00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:44.100
 and then they'll do this sort of shuddering thing.

00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:47.100
 They'll both shudder, and usually when they both shudder,

00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:50.100
 the females release the eggs and the males release the sperm.

00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:54.100
 But actually, often the females will kind of hold onto their eggs while they're doing that,

00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:58.100
 because they know that other males in the area will turn up,

00:46:58.100 --> 00:47:02.100
 and then the other males will fight with the guy she was supposedly shagging,

00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:06.100
 and then they will all fight, and then hopefully she'll end up with an even better male,

00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:08.100
 who she can then actually have sex with.

00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:10.100
 - Nice. - That is ingenious.

00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:12.100
 - Smart, isn't it? - That's really smart.

00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:16.100
 I want to hear what a trout fake orgasm sounds like.

00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:20.100
 I want to see the when Harry met Sally of the trout world.

00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:23.100
 I'll have what she's having, what, some plankton?

00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:26.100
 Yes.

00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:29.100
 - There's one in just sticklebacks. - Yeah.

00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:31.100
 Male sticklebacks also are very territorial.

00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:34.100
 The males fight a lot, and when it's in mating season,

00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:37.100
 and in mating season they go red on their undersides,

00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:40.100
 so the way they spot other males to fight is they see a flash of red,

00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:43.100
 but apparently they're not very good at distinguishing fish from other stuff,

00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:47.100
 so if you've got a pet stickleback, if like a red post fan goes by,

00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:50.100
 they'll fling themselves at the side of their tank.

00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:52.100
 The Welsh football team goes past.

00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:55.100
 Yes, exactly. They'll attack them all.

00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:58.100
 Don't wear red around the sticklebacks.

00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:00.100
 Speaking of going red, this is not in fish.

00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:02.100
 This is in mandrills, so the primates,

00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:07.100
 but it is about males attacking each other to try and get a female,

00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:09.100
 so they will kind of try and become the alpha male,

00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:12.100
 and if there's an alpha male, then you will fight against them,

00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:14.100
 and if you beat them, you become the alpha male,

00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:17.100
 and if you become the alpha male,

00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:20.100
 immediately, just as this biologically happens,

00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:24.100
 all the sexual skin on your face and genitalia turns red,

00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:28.100
 and the guy who you've beaten, his sexual skin,

00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:31.100
 goes kind of more bluey and less red,

00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:34.100
 and your testicles increase in size,

00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:38.100
 and the person you defeated, their testicles decrease in size.

00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:39.100
 Really?

00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:41.100
 It automatically happens as soon as you win the fight.

00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:44.100
 Popping off to the mandrel tale of the next morning.

00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:47.100
 Congratulations on your winning your fight last night, sir.

00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:50.100
 I'll be expanding the cropped area of these.

00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:52.100
 That's so good.

00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:54.100
 What's the sexual skin on your face?

00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:56.100
 Do we have sexual skin on our face?

00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:59.100
 Well, some of us do, Andy, but don't worry about it.

00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:03.100
 It means that it changed colour,

00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:05.100
 so that secondary sexual characteristics...

00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:06.100
 Oh, I think it's amazing to sort of...

00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:08.100
 ...like, females find it attractive.

00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:09.100
 Blushing.

00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:10.100
 Blushing, yeah, pretty much.

00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:11.100
 That's our sexual skin.

00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:12.100
 I don't know, man.

00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:14.100
 If you've got nothing else to offer, maybe, but...

00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:15.100
 Right.

00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:21.100
 Because we've got little bits of clitoris in our nose, don't we?

00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:22.100
 Excuse me?

00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:25.100
 Well, speak for yourself, Dan.

00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:28.100
 You know how they say that men can't find the clitoris?

00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:32.100
 I'm pretty sure it's in my own nose.

00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:39.100
 Well, I thought, yeah, the inside of the nose is...

00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:41.100
 You have a erectile tissue in your nose,

00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:43.100
 but I don't think that's quite the same.

00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:45.100
 Is that what it is?

00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:47.100
 That's what I was thinking of.

00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:49.100
 When blood will go to it and it will get engorged,

00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:53.100
 your poor wife is jamming your fingers up her nose every evening.

00:49:53.100 --> 00:50:01.100
 Was it good for you?

00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:03.100
 Well, it wasn't that good, I have to say.

00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:12.100
 Well, I feel like we've all learned a lot tonight.

00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:16.100
 I'm going to go home and apologize to my wife.

00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:18.100
 I feel we should all go home as well.

00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:20.100
 That's it, that is all of our facts.

00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:22.100
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:24.100
 If you would like to get in contact with any of us

00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:27.100
 about the things that we've said over the course of this podcast,

00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:30.100
 get the other three, maybe not me on this one.

00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:33.100
 But you can get me on @Sriberland, Andy.

00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:34.100
 @AndrewHunter.

00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:35.100
 @James.

00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:36.100
 @JamesHarken.

00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:37.100
 And Anna.

00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:39.100
 You can email our podcast at qi.com.

00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:42.100
 Or you can go to our group account, which is @NoSuchThing.

00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:44.100
 Or our website, NoSuchThing, is at fish.com.

00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:47.100
 All of our previous episodes are on there,

00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:49.100
 as well as a link to Club Fish.

00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:51.100
 This is our new exciting venture,

00:50:51.100 --> 00:50:54.100
 where we have awesome hidden places

00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:57.100
 where you can chat to other fish fans as a community.

00:50:57.100 --> 00:50:59.100
 There's also ad-free episodes.

00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:01.100
 Oh, shut up, James.

00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:03.100
 Stop talking about hidden places.

00:51:03.100 --> 00:51:05.100
 I can't look at you in the face anymore.

00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:09.100
 Or what else can you do?

00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:12.100
 You can have extra episodes, like Drop Us a Line.

00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:14.100
 It's our correspondence place,

00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:16.100
 where we chat about all of the facts that you're sending in

00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:17.100
 and all the letters.

00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:21.100
 Otherwise, we will be back here in Carter for another show

00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:23.100
 sometime soon, I really hope.

00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:25.100
 So thank you so much for having us,

00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:27.100
 for everyone at home listening to the show.

00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:29.100
 We'll be back again next week with another episode.

00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:30.100
 We'll see you then.

00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:31.100
 Goodbye!

00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:36.100
 (upbeat music)

00:51:36.100 --> 00:51:41.100
 (crowd cheering)

00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:43.680
 (upbeat music)

00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:46.260
 (upbeat music)
