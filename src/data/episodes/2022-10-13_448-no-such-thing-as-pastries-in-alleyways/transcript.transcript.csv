00:00:02,00:00:04,"Hi everyone, before we start this week's episode"
00:00:04,00:00:06,"of No Such Things as Fish,"
00:00:06,00:00:08,I just wanted to quickly remind you
00:00:08,00:00:12,about our super special members area known by us
00:00:12,00:00:16,and everyone who sees the name as Club Fish.
00:00:16,00:00:18,It's a wonderful place where you get loads
00:00:18,00:00:21,"of bonus content, you get all the episodes"
00:00:21,00:00:23,without any adverts.
00:00:23,00:00:25,You'll be the first to hear about any live shows
00:00:25,00:00:29,we're gonna do and we have a thing called a Discord.
00:00:29,00:00:32,"Now for the uninitiated, such as myself,"
00:00:32,00:00:34,a Discord is a place where you can go
00:00:34,00:00:38,and chat all things fish with like-minded fish fans.
00:00:38,00:00:40,"It's a really cool place to be,"
00:00:40,00:00:41,loads of fellow listeners on there
00:00:41,00:00:43,and you might even see the odd member
00:00:43,00:00:46,of No Such Things as Fish popping up from time to time.
00:00:46,00:00:49,"And when I say the odd member, I mean Dan, of course."
00:00:49,00:00:52,Like I always mean when I say the odd member.
00:00:52,00:00:53,(laughs)
00:00:53,00:00:55,"Actually, while I'm here, I might as well remind you"
00:00:55,00:00:57,that Dan has a book out.
00:00:57,00:00:58,It's called The Theory of Everything Else.
00:00:58,00:01:00,It's absolutely amazing.
00:01:00,00:01:04,It's basically all of Dan's brain printed in a book
00:01:04,00:01:07,and what could be more enticing than that.
00:01:07,00:01:08,Let's be honest.
00:01:08,00:01:11,So go out and buy that and join Club Fish if you'd like
00:01:11,00:01:13,and the place to join Club Fish
00:01:13,00:01:15,is NoSuchThingAsAFish.com
00:01:15,00:01:18,and all the information about how to subscribe to Club Fish
00:01:18,00:01:21,through Apple Podcasts or Patreon is there.
00:01:21,00:01:23,"Okay, on with the podcast."
00:01:23,00:01:25,(upbeat music)
00:01:25,00:01:28,(phone ringing)
00:01:28,00:01:31,(speaking in foreign language)
00:01:31,00:01:41,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:01:41,00:01:45,"of No Such Thing As A Fish, a weekly podcast."
00:01:45,00:01:48,This week coming to you live from Cardiff.
00:01:48,00:01:51,(audience cheering)
00:01:51,00:01:56,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:01:56,00:01:59,I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski and Drew Hunter Murray
00:01:59,00:02:01,and James Harkin.
00:02:01,00:02:03,"And once again, we have gathered round the microphones"
00:02:03,00:02:07,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:02:07,00:02:10,"And in a particular order, here we go."
00:02:10,00:02:14,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Anna."
00:02:14,00:02:17,- My fact this week is that croissant shaped croissants
00:02:17,00:02:20,taste worse than non-croissant shaped croissants.
00:02:20,00:02:23,(audience laughing)
00:02:23,00:02:24,- Croissant?
00:02:25,00:02:28,- That's a pretty hard sentence to say.
00:02:28,00:02:30,- It feels more like a complaint to waitros than a fact.
00:02:30,00:02:32,(audience laughing)
00:02:32,00:02:33,"- It's actually, it's more of a complaint"
00:02:33,00:02:34,to the country of France.
00:02:34,00:02:37,(audience laughing)
00:02:37,00:02:38,"- When you say croissant shaped croissant,"
00:02:38,00:02:40,you mean like a crescent shaped croissant.
00:02:40,00:02:42,- Exactly.
00:02:42,00:02:43,- You're classic croissant.
00:02:43,00:02:44,- A classic croissant.
00:02:44,00:02:46,"- Well, it's not actually a classic,"
00:02:46,00:02:48,"but it is, the name obviously croissant comes from the fact"
00:02:48,00:02:51,"that it is, you know, in the old school sense,"
00:02:51,00:02:53,"crescent shaped, curved, but."
00:02:53,00:02:55,- Why is it not classic?
00:02:55,00:02:57,"- Well, just because today, so many of them are straight,"
00:02:57,00:02:59,and I couldn't believe.
00:02:59,00:03:02,"- You can't redesign the classic, that's the classic."
00:03:02,00:03:04,That's what that word means.
00:03:04,00:03:05,- They've updated the classic.
00:03:05,00:03:06,It's a modern classic.
00:03:06,00:03:08,"- Modern classic, yeah."
00:03:08,00:03:09,"- The modern classic is a straight croissant,"
00:03:09,00:03:11,and they taste nicer.
00:03:11,00:03:12,Facts.
00:03:12,00:03:15,(audience laughing)
00:03:15,00:03:16,"- Surely they're just a different shape,"
00:03:16,00:03:18,so how can they taste different?
00:03:18,00:03:19,"- Ah, so glad you asked."
00:03:19,00:03:21,- Almost like I know the answer.
00:03:21,00:03:24,"- You'll probably know this if you are French,"
00:03:24,00:03:26,"or if you work in a p√¢tisserie,"
00:03:26,00:03:31,"but basically, you know, if like straight croissants,"
00:03:31,00:03:33,"so they're fat in the middle and thin on the outsides,"
00:03:33,00:03:35,"but they go in a straight line,"
00:03:35,00:03:38,"they are all butter croissants, okay?"
00:03:38,00:03:41,"But curved ones, in that little C crescent shaped,"
00:03:41,00:03:44,"croissant shape, they can actually just be made"
00:03:44,00:03:46,"with oil or margarine, which as everyone knows,"
00:03:46,00:03:48,tastes inferior.
00:03:48,00:03:50,"- But interestingly, a lot of French people"
00:03:50,00:03:52,"prefer the margarine one,"
00:03:52,00:03:54,'cause apparently it dunks better in coffee.
00:03:54,00:03:57,"- Yeah, there are claims about this."
00:03:57,00:04:00,"I feel like that's people trying to be contrary,"
00:04:00,00:04:02,"'cause let's face it, all butter croissants,"
00:04:02,00:04:04,"they're more expensive, they're more luxurious."
00:04:04,00:04:06,"In France, you know, the adults would get"
00:04:06,00:04:08,"the straight croissants, and they'd give their kids"
00:04:08,00:04:10,"the shitty, cheaper, curved croissants,"
00:04:10,00:04:12,"'cause they're made with margarine, I read that somewhere,"
00:04:12,00:04:14,and I think this is mad.
00:04:14,00:04:17,There are some claims that it's actually by law
00:04:17,00:04:20,"that margarine croissants are not allowed to be straight,"
00:04:20,00:04:21,"but I can't find that law anywhere,"
00:04:21,00:04:24,but it certainly is practice across France.
00:04:24,00:04:26,"- Somewhere in the French parliament,"
00:04:26,00:04:29,they will have a croissant division
00:04:29,00:04:31,who are looking into croissant-related legislation.
00:04:31,00:04:34,- But it's not the butter that turns the croissant
00:04:34,00:04:35,into a crescent.
00:04:35,00:04:37,"- Right, the butter doesn't do anything."
00:04:37,00:04:39,There's nothing that's happening chemically here.
00:04:39,00:04:41,It's just in practice.
00:04:41,00:04:44,"Just the rule is, if you work in a boulangerie,"
00:04:44,00:04:45,"if it's all butter croissants, it's straight."
00:04:45,00:04:48,"And if you want to make an all butter croissant curved,"
00:04:48,00:04:50,"you can, but if you want to make a margarine croissant"
00:04:50,00:04:52,"straight, you're going to prison."
00:04:52,00:04:53,(laughing)
00:04:53,00:04:55,"- But fortunately, in French prison,"
00:04:55,00:04:57,"the wine selection is very good,"
00:04:57,00:04:59,and you'll actually have a nice time.
00:04:59,00:05:03,"So there was a coup in 2016, and this is in the UK,"
00:05:03,00:05:06,"a croissant-related coup, which is Tesco replaced"
00:05:06,00:05:09,"all of its curved croissants with straight croissants,"
00:05:09,00:05:12,"and they did it, as in they just announced it,"
00:05:12,00:05:14,"and they said right from tomorrow,"
00:05:14,00:05:16,they gave people no notice or warning.
00:05:16,00:05:17,(laughing)
00:05:17,00:05:18,- 'Cause you might've gone in and just bought
00:05:18,00:05:20,"the entire stock, right, New?"
00:05:20,00:05:22,"- Well, you can't stock up, can you,"
00:05:22,00:05:23,'cause you have to buy them fresh every day.
00:05:23,00:05:25,So they knew that their customers
00:05:25,00:05:27,"would be snooker the next day, but they just said,"
00:05:27,00:05:29,"they claimed, okay, they made this claim,"
00:05:29,00:05:31,"which I think is bizarre, they claimed it was due"
00:05:31,00:05:33,"to the spreadability factor that they were,"
00:05:33,00:05:35,they were actually making life easier for their customers.
00:05:35,00:05:37,"They said, if you cut open a straight croissant,"
00:05:37,00:05:39,it's very easy to put in your jam or whatever.
00:05:39,00:05:41,"Obviously, if you cut open a curved croissant,"
00:05:41,00:05:44,"it's a nightmare, and it takes hours, blah, blah, blah."
00:05:44,00:05:46,"- I, do you know, people took the piss at the time,"
00:05:46,00:05:48,"and it was the boss of Tesco, Harry Jones, who said this,"
00:05:48,00:05:50,but I genuinely agree with him.
00:05:50,00:05:52,"He said, when the croissants curved,"
00:05:52,00:05:54,people can take up to three attempts
00:05:54,00:05:58,"to achieve perfect coverage, which increases,"
00:05:58,00:06:00,increases the potential for accidents
00:06:00,00:06:02,involving sticky fingers and tables.
00:06:02,00:06:04,"But honestly, it is harder to spread a curved croissant."
00:06:04,00:06:06,"- So I wanna, I want to, and I can't,"
00:06:06,00:06:07,"because he's not here, and I don't know him,"
00:06:07,00:06:09,pick him up on that sentence.
00:06:09,00:06:14,Sticky fingers causes accidents and other problems.
00:06:14,00:06:17,What the fuck is he talking about?
00:06:17,00:06:19,(laughing)
00:06:19,00:06:21,- What on earth is that sentence?
00:06:21,00:06:24,And he said 75% of people who were surveyed
00:06:24,00:06:26,"wanted the straighter croissant because of,"
00:06:26,00:06:29,"as Andy says, the spreadability factor."
00:06:29,00:06:31,- Am I the only one who doesn't cut open a croissant
00:06:31,00:06:32,and spread jam in it?
00:06:32,00:06:33,"- No, I don't."
00:06:33,00:06:36,"- I just find that so weird, and the other interesting"
00:06:36,00:06:39,"thing about croissants is, in that kind of respect,"
00:06:39,00:06:41,"is, you know the idea that, especially when you go to France,"
00:06:41,00:06:44,"you see them, and they're cut in half,"
00:06:44,00:06:46,and they put like ham and cheese and stuff in the middle.
00:06:46,00:06:47,"- Oh, that's here as well, yeah."
00:06:47,00:06:50,- But that was only invented in the 1970s.
00:06:50,00:06:51,- Wow.
00:06:51,00:06:52,- You know that?
00:06:52,00:06:53,"So the French, they decided to do this"
00:06:53,00:06:55,because they were worried that American hamburgers
00:06:55,00:06:56,"were coming over to France, and they thought,"
00:06:56,00:06:58,what can we do to stop--
00:06:58,00:06:59,(laughing)
00:06:59,00:07:02,"Holy, the march of the hamburger, I know what we can do."
00:07:02,00:07:04,We can put ham and cheese inside our croissants.
00:07:04,00:07:06,"- That's the French hamburger, I didn't know that."
00:07:06,00:07:09,- There were these places called croissanteries
00:07:09,00:07:12,"across France, and they were created in the 1970s"
00:07:12,00:07:14,"as a big government, like, status intervention"
00:07:14,00:07:16,in the market to deal with the scourge
00:07:16,00:07:18,of what they call le fast food.
00:07:18,00:07:19,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:07:19,00:07:21,"- I just can't imagine ever anyone's like,"
00:07:21,00:07:23,"oh, it's 1 a.m., God, it's McDonald's open."
00:07:23,00:07:26,"No, but the croissanteries are fantastic."
00:07:26,00:07:30,- I stayed in a four-star all-inclusive recently.
00:07:30,00:07:31,- Woo!
00:07:31,00:07:33,"- Bloody hell, Dan."
00:07:33,00:07:35,"- Yeah, and it was really interesting."
00:07:35,00:07:37,"They had this bit of new technology I've seen nowhere before,"
00:07:37,00:07:41,"which is, during the breakfast buffet, they had croissants,"
00:07:41,00:07:43,"and you would select your croissant,"
00:07:43,00:07:45,"of which there was almond, and just classic plain,"
00:07:45,00:07:47,"and chocolate, you get a plain one,"
00:07:47,00:07:49,"and then they had all these pipes coming out,"
00:07:49,00:07:51,"kind of like if you were pouring a pint, right?"
00:07:51,00:07:54,"There was like seven of these pint-pulling things,"
00:07:54,00:07:56,"and what they did is they take your croissant over,"
00:07:56,00:07:59,"and one dispenses chocolate, one does jam, and so on,"
00:07:59,00:08:02,"and what they do is they shove the croissant into the pipe,"
00:08:02,00:08:05,"and then they pump it full of chocolate, or jam, or whatever."
00:08:05,00:08:07,"Oh my good, it was like seeing the future."
00:08:07,00:08:09,I couldn't believe it.
00:08:09,00:08:10,"They came back, and I was like, in Italy,"
00:08:10,00:08:12,"they've got the future in the four-star-inclusives,"
00:08:12,00:08:13,it's amazing.
00:08:13,00:08:15,"I was really thinking when he launched on this story,"
00:08:15,00:08:17,I think I know more about breakfast buffet technology
00:08:17,00:08:18,"than Dan does, and I didn't."
00:08:18,00:08:21,I'm stunned.
00:08:21,00:08:23,"You need to know where that is now, don't you, Andy,"
00:08:23,00:08:25,'cause you are a bit of an expert on breakfast buffets.
00:08:25,00:08:27,"The last all-inclusive I went to on the breakfast buffet,"
00:08:27,00:08:30,"they had Haribo's, and I must admit,"
00:08:30,00:08:33,I did not eat a single croissant that week.
00:08:33,00:08:36,"The French, of course, should actually put Haribo"
00:08:36,00:08:37,on their croissants.
00:08:37,00:08:39,One thing about croissants that's really interesting
00:08:39,00:08:42,"is that they're quite new, right?"
00:08:42,00:08:44,"So the oldest recipe, as far as I could find,"
00:08:44,00:08:47,"which is of a traditional classic,"
00:08:47,00:08:50,"or even modern classic, croissant, is from 1906."
00:08:50,00:08:52,"And so that means that Napoleon didn't eat croissants,"
00:08:52,00:08:54,"Bolzac, Victor Hugo, Georges Sainte,"
00:08:54,00:08:56,they never ate a croissant in their life.
00:08:56,00:08:57,Wow.
00:08:57,00:08:59,Maybe that's why they were so productive.
00:08:59,00:09:02,Maybe the croissants led to the downfall of France.
00:09:02,00:09:06,Did you guys hear about Operation Croissant?
00:09:06,00:09:07,No.
00:09:07,00:09:08,Operation Croissant was something
00:09:08,00:09:09,that was launched in 2016.
00:09:09,00:09:13,It was an Anglo-French operation.
00:09:13,00:09:15,"It was the day before the Brexit vote,"
00:09:15,00:09:18,and a campaign group tried to campaign on Brexit
00:09:18,00:09:20,"with Operation Croissant, which was giving out croissants"
00:09:20,00:09:24,accompanied by pro-EU messages written by people in France
00:09:24,00:09:27,"on postcards saying, please, you know, don't leave."
00:09:27,00:09:29,"And the croissants get this,"
00:09:29,00:09:32,"they had been baked that morning, the 22nd of June,"
00:09:32,00:09:35,"and they come to London on the first Euro star of the day,"
00:09:35,00:09:37,"and there were 600 croissants, which would be on there."
00:09:37,00:09:38,That's a lot of effort for something
00:09:38,00:09:41,"that ended up being completely fucking useless, isn't it?"
00:09:41,00:09:44,"It's very romantic, though, and very French,"
00:09:44,00:09:46,"and they had 600 croissants ready to give out,"
00:09:46,00:09:50,and then the police interceded.
00:09:50,00:09:52,The police stopped them and said it's illegal
00:09:52,00:09:55,"to use food, drink, or entertainment to influence a vote."
00:09:55,00:09:56,"Oh, it is, yeah."
00:09:56,00:09:59,"And so they were all imprisoned, actually,"
00:09:59,00:10:02,"for, there's some of them are still in."
00:10:02,00:10:04,"No, they issued a statement saying,"
00:10:04,00:10:05,we are happy to fall on our baguettes
00:10:05,00:10:08,and stick to the right side of British law.
00:10:09,00:10:13,Have you guys heard this is an America of the Cronut?
00:10:13,00:10:14,Yeah. Yeah.
00:10:14,00:10:16,Am I the only one who hasn't heard of the Cronut?
00:10:16,00:10:17,I think it might be.
00:10:17,00:10:19,"Oh, okay."
00:10:19,00:10:22,Have you guys heard of the Croffin?
00:10:22,00:10:23,It's Croffin.
00:10:23,00:10:24,Okay. No.
00:10:24,00:10:29,"Do you know, I reckon, between us, even if we haven't,"
00:10:29,00:10:30,I reckon we can put it together.
00:10:30,00:10:31,Go on then.
00:10:31,00:10:33,"It's a Cronut full of stuffing, isn't it?"
00:10:33,00:10:34,Yeah. Yeah.
00:10:34,00:10:36,"It's a Christmas, it's a Christmas crustal,"
00:10:36,00:10:38,"full of stuff, yeah."
00:10:38,00:10:40,"So anyway, you guys must have facts."
00:10:40,00:10:41,"No, no, this is..."
00:10:41,00:10:44,"Hey, Dan, have you heard of the Cromosa?"
00:10:44,00:10:47,Cromosa.
00:10:47,00:10:49,"Someone gasped then, as if this is the greatest thing"
00:10:49,00:10:50,they've ever heard.
00:10:50,00:10:54,"Basically, a croissant with Samosa filling and then deep-fried."
00:10:54,00:10:55,"Oh, lovely. Yeah."
00:10:55,00:11:00,"Have you heard of, if we're doing this, which I think we are,"
00:11:00,00:11:01,a Kregel?
00:11:01,00:11:03,A Kregel. Okay.
00:11:03,00:11:04,Yep. Yep.
00:11:04,00:11:06,That's a croissant and a bagel?
00:11:06,00:11:07,Anyone like to take the next one?
00:11:07,00:11:09,"Oh, have you heard of one? I'll go for one."
00:11:09,00:11:10,A townie.
00:11:10,00:11:12,"A townie. It's not very politically correct, James."
00:11:12,00:11:13,There are no croissants involved.
00:11:13,00:11:14,What is it?
00:11:14,00:11:17,"It's a half tart, half brownie."
00:11:17,00:11:18,Oh!
00:11:18,00:11:21,"And finally, one more, a doughnut."
00:11:21,00:11:22,You know what that is?
00:11:22,00:11:24,"A pug, a pug and a doughnut."
00:11:24,00:11:25,A pug that's been turned into a doughnut.
00:11:25,00:11:27,Yes!
00:11:27,00:11:28,It's not so far off.
00:11:28,00:11:32,It's a doughnut crossed with a chicken nugget.
00:11:32,00:11:33,Ah!
00:11:33,00:11:36,Which is basically just a doughnut-shaped chicken nugget.
00:11:36,00:11:38,Wow.
00:11:38,00:11:40,It still tastes the same.
00:11:40,00:11:43,"The cronut, an interesting thing about the cronut,"
00:11:43,00:11:46,"is that this was made in 2013, and it was in America."
00:11:46,00:11:49,And it was a bakery guy who wanted to do a doughnut
00:11:49,00:11:53,"meets the croissant, and it took off massively straight away."
00:11:53,00:11:54,So he released it on one day.
00:11:54,00:11:56,"The next day, there was a queue of 100 people"
00:11:56,00:11:59,trying to get access to the cronut.
00:11:59,00:12:02,"And the market value, the black market value"
00:12:02,00:12:04,of the cronut immediately was massive.
00:12:04,00:12:08,"So you would buy it for something like $2 or $3, $4 or $5, right?"
00:12:08,00:12:09,It was selling for like $100.
00:12:09,00:12:11,There were people in alleyways.
00:12:11,00:12:13,"Yeah, it was such hot property."
00:12:13,00:12:14,In alleyways.
00:12:14,00:12:15,In alleyways in New York.
00:12:15,00:12:16,You wouldn't buy a pastry in an alleyway.
00:12:16,00:12:18,You would if it was a cronut.
00:12:18,00:12:20,"Because cronuts were, they were so popular."
00:12:20,00:12:23,"And so, it was a guy called Dominique Ansel,"
00:12:23,00:12:25,"who was the creator of the cronut,"
00:12:25,00:12:27,and it was so popular that he trademarked it.
00:12:27,00:12:29,So he owns it. No one else can make a cronut.
00:12:29,00:12:31,They can. They just don't call it a cronut.
00:12:31,00:12:34,"Well, no, there's the doissant, which you can get."
00:12:34,00:12:36,But you can't get the original.
00:12:36,00:12:39,"And so, yeah, but there was a huge black market value for it."
00:12:39,00:12:43,"God, people are stupid, aren't they?"
00:12:43,00:12:44,"We should say, just because otherwise people"
00:12:44,00:12:47,"are going to write in that, and I never thought I'd say this,"
00:12:47,00:12:50,James turns out to be the most sophisticated of the four of us
00:12:50,00:12:53,"in this one metric, because in France,"
00:12:53,00:12:56,they never put filling into their croissants.
00:12:56,00:12:57,Which I didn't actually realise.
00:12:57,00:13:00,But all Frenchers seem to concur on this.
00:13:00,00:13:03,They say that they've literally never in their whole life
00:13:03,00:13:06,met someone from France who puts jam or butter even worse
00:13:06,00:13:07,on their croissants.
00:13:07,00:13:09,Because it's got all the butter in it already.
00:13:09,00:13:10,But it's only half butter.
00:13:10,00:13:13,"But people, it doesn't taste the same as when you melt"
00:13:13,00:13:14,the new layer of butter into it.
00:13:14,00:13:16,I've got no patience with people who say
00:13:16,00:13:18,there's enough butter in croissants already.
00:13:18,00:13:20,You can never have enough butter.
00:13:20,00:13:24,Do you know the Concorde du Mayor croissant de Grand Paris?
00:13:24,00:13:27,This is the French croissant championships.
00:13:27,00:13:29,Did you go for a French shirt?
00:13:29,00:13:30,"Sorry, I didn't mean to."
00:13:30,00:13:31,I didn't mean to.
00:13:31,00:13:34,But it's the most French thing you can imagine.
00:13:34,00:13:38,"So it's the greater Paris best class on competition, basically."
00:13:38,00:13:41,And there was a brilliant National Geographic piece about it.
00:13:41,00:13:43,The judge's comments are just so French.
00:13:43,00:13:44,So listen to this one.
00:13:44,00:13:46,"""It's executed to perfection."
00:13:46,00:13:48,"""If Marie Antoinette had offered these to the French people,"
00:13:48,00:13:50,"""there probably wouldn't have been a revolution."""
00:13:50,00:13:56,"He also says at the beginning,"
00:13:56,00:13:58,"""It's executed to perfection."""
00:13:58,00:13:59,Which...
00:13:59,00:14:01,LAUGHTER
00:14:01,00:14:10,"It is time for fact number two, and that is James."
00:14:10,00:14:14,"OK, my fact this week is that Manchester City women's football"
00:14:14,00:14:17,team has a menstrual cycle coach.
00:14:17,00:14:19,No.
00:14:19,00:14:22,Is that a cycling coach who is also menstrual?
00:14:22,00:14:24,LAUGHTER
00:14:24,00:14:25,Or is it...?
00:14:25,00:14:29,"No, it's a coach to get the best out of their players"
00:14:29,00:14:30,when they're on their periods.
00:14:30,00:14:32,"Or in fact, for all different parts of the month."
00:14:32,00:14:35,"So this was an article I read in The Economist,"
00:14:35,00:14:37,"and they were talking about this in general,"
00:14:37,00:14:39,and then I found out that Man City have this.
00:14:39,00:14:42,"But basically, I mean, it really makes sense, right?"
00:14:42,00:14:44,"So if you're an elite sports person,"
00:14:44,00:14:47,"you're really always aiming for that extra, like, 1%"
00:14:47,00:14:49,that'll just make you better than anyone else.
00:14:49,00:14:51,"And a load of studies have been done,"
00:14:51,00:14:53,"and more and more are being done,"
00:14:53,00:14:55,that show that women's performance fluctuates
00:14:55,00:14:57,at different times of the month due to their cycle.
00:14:57,00:15:00,And so it really makes sense that you have someone on your team
00:15:00,00:15:03,who can get the most out of your players by working that out.
00:15:03,00:15:06,"Oh, so it's not like you'll be hauled off halfway through a match"
00:15:06,00:15:09,"because the cycle coach has looked at their watch and said,"
00:15:09,00:15:11,"""No, she's on. Get her off."""
00:15:11,00:15:12,"I should hope not. No, OK."
00:15:12,00:15:13,I'm really hope that doesn't happen.
00:15:13,00:15:16,"I don't think it works like that, either, OK."
00:15:16,00:15:18,LAUGHTER
00:15:18,00:15:23,I've seen those adverts just roller-skated along.
00:15:23,00:15:25,LAUGHTER
00:15:25,00:15:27,"But this is the other thing that's really important,"
00:15:27,00:15:32,"is that women footballers are way, way more likely"
00:15:32,00:15:34,"to get certain injuries than male footballers, right?"
00:15:34,00:15:37,"So there's a thing called the anterior cruciate ligament,"
00:15:37,00:15:39,"and, like, football fans will know that this is something"
00:15:39,00:15:41,"that plagues, like, male footballers,"
00:15:41,00:15:43,"but it's really, really bad for women."
00:15:43,00:15:46,And apparently women are eight times more likely
00:15:46,00:15:48,to get an ACL injury than men.
00:15:48,00:15:51,And a lot of people think that it's related to the menstrual cycle.
00:15:51,00:15:53,"So Arsenal midfielder Jordan Knobbs,"
00:15:53,00:15:57,"she missed out of the 2019 World Cup because of her ACL,"
00:15:57,00:16:00,"and she reckons it was because of the time of the month she was on,"
00:16:00,00:16:02,and that made her weaker.
00:16:02,00:16:05,"Yeah, apparently, basically, your menstrual cycle is split,"
00:16:05,00:16:07,"not yours, but half of our menstrual cycles"
00:16:07,00:16:09,"are split into essentially two phases,"
00:16:09,00:16:12,the follicular and the luteal phase.
00:16:12,00:16:15,"And in the late follicular phase,"
00:16:15,00:16:18,"which I believe is week two, so you've had your period,"
00:16:18,00:16:20,"and then it's kind of the week after that,"
00:16:20,00:16:21,"that's when estrogen concentration is highest,"
00:16:21,00:16:23,"and that's when you're just going to get injured,"
00:16:23,00:16:26,"your bones are going to snap, your ligaments are going to break."
00:16:26,00:16:30,"You should basically stay in a padded room for a week,"
00:16:30,00:16:31,it turns out.
00:16:31,00:16:34,"Well, the thing is that estrogen is anabolic,"
00:16:34,00:16:37,"so you'll know anabolic steroids that people take to build muscles,"
00:16:37,00:16:39,"so estrogen helps muscle to build,"
00:16:39,00:16:41,so that's one difference that happens.
00:16:41,00:16:43,But really what you do is you make sure that your diet
00:16:43,00:16:45,is different at different times of the month.
00:16:45,00:16:47,You can change your training so you can work harder
00:16:47,00:16:49,"at one time of the month and less harder at another time of the month,"
00:16:49,00:16:51,that's what they're kind of doing in city.
00:16:51,00:16:56,I was also looking at other bits of sport science in women's football.
00:16:56,00:16:57,"I didn't realise the England women's team,"
00:16:57,00:17:00,they have personalised bra prescriptions.
00:17:00,00:17:01,"- Did they? - Yeah, they did this year."
00:17:01,00:17:05,They got in a breast biomechanics expert or two
00:17:05,00:17:08,"to provide very, very personalised bras"
00:17:08,00:17:10,"- to ensure that they got the right, literally, the support they needed. - Really?"
00:17:10,00:17:13,"Do you have to go into a chemist and they say,"
00:17:13,00:17:16,"""We'll just make that up for you every 10 minutes?"""
00:17:16,00:17:18,You've got a seamstress in the back.
00:17:18,00:17:21,"The Guardian covered it and they said, ""If those cups could talk..."""
00:17:21,00:17:24,- Slightly creepy way of putting it. - LAUGHTER
00:17:24,00:17:27,"""They might claim a share of the lioness's victory for themselves."""
00:17:27,00:17:30,- Right. - But it genuinely makes a massive difference.
00:17:30,00:17:34,"And supposedly, if you run in a poorly-supportive bra,"
00:17:34,00:17:37,it can shorten a woman's stride by four centimetres.
00:17:37,00:17:39,"And that, and I'm going to need some help with this statistic,"
00:17:39,00:17:42,can add up to an extra mile over the length of a marathon.
00:17:42,00:17:44,"Now, that's what I read. I don't understand how..."
00:17:44,00:17:46,Does that mean when you get to everyone else's run 26 miles
00:17:46,00:17:48,and you still have to do another mile?
00:17:48,00:17:50,"Well, that's what I don't understand."
00:17:50,00:17:53,I think it means that you have to do more strides to do the marathon.
00:17:53,00:17:55,- I see. - But I... Yeah.
00:17:55,00:17:59,I don't think it means that you get to finish early.
00:17:59,00:18:01,"I like, with the lionesses, there's so many..."
00:18:01,00:18:04,"Like, superstition is a big thing within footballers,"
00:18:04,00:18:06,where they have to follow certain routines.
00:18:06,00:18:08,"We see it in sports where, like, Serena Williams"
00:18:08,00:18:12,will wear the same pair of socks throughout a competition.
00:18:12,00:18:14,"If she plays Wimbledon, she'll wear the same pair of socks,"
00:18:14,00:18:17,"just so it makes it sort of feel like she'll win, that sort of thing."
00:18:17,00:18:21,"With the lionesses, there's one player who always needs to have beans on toast."
00:18:21,00:18:23,"That's her thing. She thinks, ""That's going to help me."""
00:18:23,00:18:26,"- Okay. - It's just routine, and it's what they do."
00:18:26,00:18:28,"And then another thing was, there was one match"
00:18:28,00:18:32,"where a few of them had a ponytail that was done by one of the players,"
00:18:32,00:18:33,and they had a great game.
00:18:33,00:18:36,They started believing that this ponytail was part of the sort of...
00:18:36,00:18:39,Who the hell needs someone else to do their ponytails?
00:18:39,00:18:41,I've seen the ponytails of the England women's team.
00:18:41,00:18:43,They're pretty basic ponytails.
00:18:43,00:18:47,"When the Euros were on earlier this year,"
00:18:47,00:18:51,the Guardian newspaper had biographies of all 368 players.
00:18:51,00:18:54,- Okay. - So I read all of those.
00:18:54,00:18:57,"- Nice. - And I'll be honest,"
00:18:57,00:18:59,there wasn't that much in there.
00:18:59,00:19:03,"So Lena McGull, who plays for Germany, this is her fun fact."
00:19:03,00:19:08,She was born exactly 225 days to the day after Napoleon Bonaparte.
00:19:08,00:19:10,225 days?
00:19:10,00:19:12,- Yes. - Yes.
00:19:12,00:19:15,"- She's very fit for her age. - She's very, very old."
00:19:15,00:19:21,- Wow. - She will only have got croissants since the 1970s.
00:19:21,00:19:26,"She was 200 years older. She's like, ""What is this?"""
00:19:26,00:19:29,"Marie-Leon, let's see if I can get this one right. She's Spanish."
00:19:29,00:19:33,"She has lots of tattoos, but they're only on her left arm."
00:19:33,00:19:35,Can you work out why they're only on her left arm?
00:19:35,00:19:37,"She right-handed, but she's a tattoo artist."
00:19:37,00:19:40,"- Correct. - Oh, wow!"
00:19:40,00:19:44,"That's really good. And another one, Viviane May Diemer,"
00:19:44,00:19:45,who's from the Netherlands.
00:19:45,00:19:48,She always got upset because people called her the goat.
00:19:48,00:19:51,- So goat means greatest of all time. - Yeah.
00:19:51,00:19:54,But she didn't know that's what it meant.
00:19:54,00:19:57,"And she just said, ""A goat is not the best animal to be."""
00:19:57,00:20:00,Why are they calling me a goat?
00:20:00,00:20:03,- That's so good. - I love that.
00:20:03,00:20:08,"So we mentioned ages and ages ago, there was a band, the English FA,"
00:20:08,00:20:11,"they banned women's football in about 1920, didn't they?"
00:20:11,00:20:13,"- 21, I think, yes. - They banned women from playing on their pictures,"
00:20:13,00:20:14,which effectively banned it.
00:20:14,00:20:16,So it sort of shut down the game.
00:20:16,00:20:18,But this happened all over Europe.
00:20:18,00:20:20,So the French game was their football federation.
00:20:20,00:20:22,They banned it in 1933.
00:20:22,00:20:25,"West Germany, 1955."
00:20:25,00:20:28,"Spain, 1930, to '75, it was banned."
00:20:28,00:20:31,"Or it was banned in the '20s and '30s,"
00:20:31,00:20:35,and then all the bans were lifted in about the very late '60s or early '70s.
00:20:35,00:20:37,- Yeah. - Yeah. It's just very peculiar.
00:20:37,00:20:39,"Yeah, it is very weird."
00:20:39,00:20:42,"Although some sort of underground matches did happen,"
00:20:42,00:20:44,"socially underground, not literally underground,"
00:20:44,00:20:46,in the interim.
00:20:46,00:20:48,And I think there was...
00:20:48,00:20:50,"It was the early 1970s, as you say,"
00:20:50,00:20:53,that it started to come back into the mainstream again.
00:20:53,00:20:57,And there was the Unofficial Women's World Cup in Italy in 1970.
00:20:57,00:21:01,"And I think FIFA refused to play a part in that, but it did happen."
00:21:01,00:21:02,And it was quite popular.
00:21:02,00:21:04,And then there was a follow-up in Mexico in '71.
00:21:04,00:21:06,And it was really popular.
00:21:06,00:21:11,"So I had no idea. The final, in 1971, had a crowd of 110,000,"
00:21:11,00:21:12,which I think is the biggest women's crowd ever.
00:21:12,00:21:15,"And there have been claims made about similar crowds recently,"
00:21:15,00:21:17,but I think that's bigger than all of them.
00:21:17,00:21:18,"- Yeah, that's right. - Amazing."
00:21:18,00:21:20,"Yeah, and it was great."
00:21:20,00:21:22,It was sponsored by Martini.
00:21:22,00:21:26,So I guess you got free shots of fortified wine
00:21:26,00:21:29,"given out to you, the classic football drink."
00:21:29,00:21:31,And to make it...
00:21:31,00:21:36,"Weirdly, to make it appeal more to the female audience, I guess,"
00:21:36,00:21:39,they painted the gold frames with pink and white
00:21:39,00:21:42,and all the stadium stuff with pink outfits.
00:21:42,00:21:43,"No, there's an intake of breath,"
00:21:43,00:21:45,but I do think that pink gets a bad reputation
00:21:45,00:21:48,because it's not an objectively bad colour.
00:21:48,00:21:50,"But, yeah."
00:21:50,00:21:53,"It feels like a bad colour for a football goal, though, right?"
00:21:53,00:21:55,A nice bright white is what you want.
00:21:55,00:21:58,"- That's probably the most contrast, isn't it? - Yeah."
00:21:58,00:22:00,Better than painting it green.
00:22:00,00:22:03,I read about what I think might be the earliest example
00:22:03,00:22:05,of a woman playing football.
00:22:05,00:22:07,It was this woman who was born just after Napalm.
00:22:07,00:22:08,"No, it wasn't."
00:22:08,00:22:11,"It was in 1773 in Yorkshire,"
00:22:11,00:22:13,and it was a match between the married gentlemen
00:22:13,00:22:18,of the town of Walton and the bachelors of the town of Walton.
00:22:18,00:22:19,"And it said in the report, it said,"
00:22:19,00:22:23,"""The game had many falls and broken shins on each side,"
00:22:23,00:22:25,"""and at one stage, the wife of one of the married men"
00:22:25,00:22:27,"""went to help him after he was injured."
00:22:27,00:22:29,"""She then went after the ball"
00:22:29,00:22:31,"""and secured victory for her husband's team."""
00:22:31,00:22:33,Oh.
00:22:33,00:22:36,"It doesn't count, though, really, it's an illegal move, isn't it?"
00:22:36,00:22:39,"- Kind of a random play, I don't know. - I'm stumbling from the ground."
00:22:39,00:22:43,"Women's football basically has, just until recently,"
00:22:43,00:22:48,"had just terrible, even internally from the football community,"
00:22:48,00:22:50,"particularly the officials, just terrible times."
00:22:50,00:22:55,"1991, FIFA didn't want to name the women's World Cup the World Cup."
00:22:55,00:22:59,"So instead, they got a sponsor, so it was the M&M's Cup."
00:22:59,00:23:03,They could have named it after Mars bars and called it the Mars Cups.
00:23:03,00:23:05,"- You have the World Cup and the Mars Cup. - Oh, yeah!"
00:23:05,00:23:08,- And then they could have done an intergalactic match against each other. - Exactly.
00:23:08,00:23:11,"- Yeah, Solar Cup. - And those games, they made the games 10 minutes shorter."
00:23:11,00:23:13,- Yeah. - Just in case the women collapsed
00:23:13,00:23:15,when playing for the full 90 minutes.
00:23:15,00:23:17,"- Yeah, yeah. - That seems to be the reasoning."
00:23:17,00:23:19,"- That was 1991, right? - Yeah, yeah."
00:23:19,00:23:22,"And when West Germany listed its ban in 1970,"
00:23:22,00:23:24,"the games were only 70 minutes long,"
00:23:24,00:23:28,and they were only allowed to be played in warm weather.
00:23:28,00:23:30,"- It's crazy. - Basically, just in case Cold Weather"
00:23:30,00:23:34,"- killed the players. - Yeah, that seems to be the panic that there was."
00:23:34,00:23:40,"And Seth Blatter, who is the president of FIFA, right?"
00:23:40,00:23:43,"He was asked about women's football, this was a while ago,"
00:23:43,00:23:45,"- and he suggested that... - He was a very progressive man,"
00:23:45,00:23:50,so I'm looking forward to an extremely liberal and thoughtful comment here.
00:23:50,00:23:53,I hope we're not going to tarnish the good name of Seth Blatter in this room.
00:23:53,00:23:54,Really not!
00:23:54,00:23:59,He said that he suggested to get more people watching women's football
00:23:59,00:24:01,that female players should wear tighter shorts
00:24:01,00:24:05,to promote a more female aesthetic.
00:24:05,00:24:07,"He said they could, for example, have tighter shorts."
00:24:07,00:24:12,"Female players are pretty, if you excuse me, for saying so."
00:24:12,00:24:14,"And they already have some different rules to men,"
00:24:14,00:24:16,such as playing with a lighter ball.
00:24:16,00:24:19,They don't play with a lighter ball.
00:24:19,00:24:21,"You did used to be there, you used to be playing with kids' balls."
00:24:21,00:24:23,"In Japan, when they started playing women's football in the 80s,"
00:24:23,00:24:26,"they played with a children's ball, I think,"
00:24:26,00:24:29,"and the halves lasted 25 minutes,"
00:24:29,00:24:34,"and handballs were permissible if it was players protecting their own breasts,"
00:24:34,00:24:36,which I actually think is a fine rule.
00:24:36,00:24:39,I'm going to need to move us on in a second.
00:24:39,00:24:42,I was looking at world records for Keepey Uppies.
00:24:42,00:24:43,"Oh, yeah."
00:24:43,00:24:47,"Because in 2003, there was a woman called Milen Dominguez,"
00:24:47,00:24:49,who's quite a famous-age footballer.
00:24:49,00:24:53,"She's the ex-wife of Ronaldo, not the Ronaldo that you would know, Andy,"
00:24:53,00:24:55,but the Ronaldo that football fans would know.
00:24:55,00:24:59,"Oh, it's so nice that you presume I know any of the Ronaldo's."
00:24:59,00:25:01,"I'm really, like, I'm quite proud of it."
00:25:01,00:25:07,"Anyway, she was 17 at the time, and she did 55,187 Keepey Uppies,"
00:25:07,00:25:09,which was a world record.
00:25:09,00:25:11,"Now, according to the Guinness Book of Records,"
00:25:11,00:25:13,the current world record was made in 2009.
00:25:13,00:25:16,"It was by a British guy called Dan Magnus,"
00:25:16,00:25:19,and he did 24 hours of Keepey Uppies in Covent Garden.
00:25:19,00:25:21,"He did over 200,000 touches."
00:25:21,00:25:22,What?
00:25:22,00:25:26,But he was allowed a few breaks to kind of stretch his legs
00:25:26,00:25:28,"and stretch his muscles and stuff,"
00:25:28,00:25:30,whereas Milen Dominguez didn't have any breaks.
00:25:30,00:25:32,"And whenever she needed to do anything,"
00:25:32,00:25:35,"whenever she needed to eat, drink or go to the toilet,"
00:25:35,00:25:38,she did it by balancing the ball on the back of her neck
00:25:38,00:25:41,and then backing up and sitting down and doing it.
00:25:41,00:25:43,So I reckon she should still have the record.
00:25:43,00:25:44,"Oh, my God."
00:25:44,00:25:45,That's amazing.
00:25:45,00:25:46,"I think I will just have a main, actually."
00:25:46,00:25:47,I'm going to skip the starter.
00:25:47,00:25:48,Thank you very much.
00:25:48,00:25:49,Wow.
00:25:49,00:25:52,"And then there was a 12-year-old called Imogen Papwerth Heidel,"
00:25:52,00:25:56,who last year did 7.1 million Keepey Uppies.
00:25:56,00:25:57,Sorry?
00:25:57,00:26:00,But she had a lot of them donated by other people.
00:26:00,00:26:05,So the idea was that she was going to do one for every key worker
00:26:05,00:26:08,"in the UK after, you know, COVID stuff."
00:26:08,00:26:12,"And she, in fairness, she did, like, over a million"
00:26:12,00:26:13,over a long period of time.
00:26:13,00:26:17,"But the rest were donated by Marcus Rashford, Lucy Bronze,"
00:26:17,00:26:19,"and Spandau Balleig star, Martin Kemp."
00:26:19,00:26:20,"Oh, cool."
00:26:20,00:26:22,"Go, Martin."
00:26:22,00:26:26,"It's been a joy patch since he left his standards, hasn't it?"
00:26:26,00:26:36,"It is time for fact number three, and that is my fact."
00:26:36,00:26:40,My fact this week is that two of the leading archaeologists
00:26:40,00:26:43,to dig up King Richard III's bones
00:26:43,00:26:46,were called King and Richard.
00:26:46,00:26:48,(LAUGHTER)
00:26:48,00:26:51,"So, a slight correction of my fact."
00:26:51,00:26:53,"One was an archaeologist, another was a geneticist,"
00:26:53,00:26:56,"and this was two people called Richard Buckley,"
00:26:56,00:27:00,"who's of the University of Leicester Archaeological Services,"
00:27:00,00:27:02,"and Professor Turi King, who's the geneticist,"
00:27:02,00:27:06,who was the person who went and did all of the DNA testing
00:27:06,00:27:08,to prove that Richard III was who he was.
00:27:08,00:27:11,"So can I just say, Dan, like, maybe about two months ago,"
00:27:11,00:27:15,"you did another fact, which was that someone from the movie"
00:27:15,00:27:17,King Richard was called Richard King?
00:27:17,00:27:19,"Yeah, the editor of the movie."
00:27:19,00:27:22,Are you just looking up Richard King's?
00:27:22,00:27:23,(LAUGHTER)
00:27:23,00:27:24,It's my new hobby.
00:27:24,00:27:28,I'm just trying to find anyone called Richard or King.
00:27:28,00:27:32,"So the big story that I'm sure everyone remembers,"
00:27:32,00:27:34,"episode one of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:27:34,00:27:38,in which we mentioned that the reason that King Richard III
00:27:38,00:27:41,was found was because there was a screenwriter called
00:27:41,00:27:43,"Philippa Langley, who was doing some research"
00:27:43,00:27:45,for the script that she was going to write.
00:27:45,00:27:46,She was walking through Leicester.
00:27:46,00:27:49,"She passed a car park, and she had a sudden feeling"
00:27:49,00:27:51,that Richard was there.
00:27:51,00:27:54,"And so she went away, and she told her friends,"
00:27:54,00:27:56,"and she was like, ""I just felt like he was there."""
00:27:56,00:27:58,"And she kept telling this story, and eventually she thought,"
00:27:58,00:28:00,"""I'm going to go back and check if he's there."""
00:28:00,00:28:03,"She goes back a year later, she walks into the car park."
00:28:03,00:28:06,"This time, she sees something that wasn't there last time,"
00:28:06,00:28:10,"which is a giant R, which is painted onto the ground,"
00:28:10,00:28:12,"which she thinks is like a helicopter sign,"
00:28:12,00:28:14,which just means Richard is here.
00:28:14,00:28:18,"And so she puts forward a plan to Richard Buckley,"
00:28:18,00:28:20,"who I've just mentioned, saying,"
00:28:20,00:28:21,"""I'd like to get a dig going here,"""
00:28:21,00:28:23,and she helped to raise the funds.
00:28:23,00:28:25,"Anyway, the story is that they found the King"
00:28:25,00:28:27,"underneath the R, but recently,"
00:28:27,00:28:29,"while I was trying to do some research on a photo,"
00:28:29,00:28:32,"a friend of mine was in touch with Tourie King,"
00:28:32,00:28:34,"Professor Tourie King, and she said,"
00:28:34,00:28:36,"""Oh, you're not getting in touch about the R"
00:28:36,00:28:38,"""underneath where he was found,"""
00:28:38,00:28:40,because he wasn't found underneath the R.
00:28:40,00:28:42,So that's been a big story.
00:28:42,00:28:45,"So I thought, okay, because probably it's very annoying"
00:28:45,00:28:46,as an archaeologist or a geneticist
00:28:46,00:28:49,that when you've used actual science to find
00:28:49,00:28:52,"remains of a body, that someone else is claiming"
00:28:52,00:28:55,that they use psychic intuition to find it.
00:28:55,00:28:57,"But then, she doesn't acknowledge the fact"
00:28:57,00:28:59,that there's huge synchronicity in the point
00:28:59,00:29:02,"that Richard and King, these two people,"
00:29:02,00:29:03,found the fucking body.
00:29:03,00:29:05,"Yeah, yeah."
00:29:05,00:29:09,And there's a third incredible nomenclature link
00:29:09,00:29:10,"to this, Dan."
00:29:10,00:29:13,"So after the bones of Richard the Third were found,"
00:29:13,00:29:14,they were then reinterred.
00:29:14,00:29:16,There was a big ceremony for the reburial
00:29:16,00:29:18,"of Richard the Third, and the man who made"
00:29:18,00:29:20,the lead-lined casket that the King was put in
00:29:20,00:29:23,was called John Castleman.
00:29:23,00:29:27,"And what is a king, if not a man?"
00:29:27,00:29:28,Wow.
00:29:28,00:29:30,Who lives in a castle.
00:29:30,00:29:31,So true.
00:29:31,00:29:32,And isn't that spooky?
00:29:32,00:29:34,Haven't the hairs on the back of your neck gone up?
00:29:34,00:29:35,Yeah.
00:29:35,00:29:37,There's one interesting sort of spooky thing
00:29:37,00:29:39,"about Richard the Third,"
00:29:39,00:29:40,"and that is that there's, I only learned this"
00:29:40,00:29:42,"by doing this research this week,"
00:29:42,00:29:43,and that is that there's a theory
00:29:43,00:29:46,that Leicester City won the Premier League
00:29:46,00:29:48,with the help from Richard the Third's ghost.
00:29:48,00:29:50,"Oh, yes."
00:29:50,00:29:51,"And on the Leicester City website,"
00:29:51,00:29:54,they have a lot of evidence as to why this is the case.
00:29:54,00:29:55,Really?
00:29:55,00:29:57,"So they won the league, but the season before,"
00:29:57,00:29:58,"they were bottom of the league,"
00:29:58,00:30:00,"and they, you know, it was about Christmas,"
00:30:00,00:30:02,"and they'd lost, lost, lost, lost, lost."
00:30:02,00:30:06,"And then, they laid Richard the Third to rest,"
00:30:06,00:30:08,"and nine days later, their next game"
00:30:08,00:30:09,"was against West Ham,"
00:30:09,00:30:12,and they won that game with a last-minute goal
00:30:12,00:30:14,by Andy King.
00:30:14,00:30:15,No!
00:30:15,00:30:17,"Dun, dun, dun."
00:30:17,00:30:18,This is ridiculous.
00:30:18,00:30:19,"And Richard was actually,"
00:30:19,00:30:22,"he went from the bottom of the car park to the top,"
00:30:22,00:30:24,"didn't he, when they dug him up?"
00:30:24,00:30:25,So it's awful.
00:30:25,00:30:26,I feel like I've got to...
00:30:26,00:30:27,"I'll just tell you from the Leicester City website,"
00:30:27,00:30:28,"that's all, that's amazing."
00:30:28,00:30:30,"I'm at a conspiracy theorist meeting,"
00:30:30,00:30:32,and it's freaking me out.
00:30:32,00:30:34,I just want to mention something that I like
00:30:34,00:30:36,about Cheery King that she discovered.
00:30:36,00:30:38,"So, as you say, she's a geneticist,"
00:30:38,00:30:39,"so she was one who said,"
00:30:39,00:30:40,"""Look, this is Richard the Third,"""
00:30:40,00:30:43,and the DNA match was made by comparing people
00:30:43,00:30:46,who had descended from his mother's side of the family
00:30:46,00:30:49,"to his DNA, but she then thought,"
00:30:49,00:30:51,"""Okay, let's just check out the other side of the family."""
00:30:51,00:30:53,And they...
00:30:53,00:30:56,"First of all, she and her team of geneticists,"
00:30:56,00:30:59,"they got relations of Henry Somerset,"
00:30:59,00:31:02,who was descended from the same great-great-grandfather
00:31:02,00:31:05,"as Richard the Third, so they'd have to share DNA."
00:31:05,00:31:07,"They got people who were related to Henry Somerset,"
00:31:07,00:31:11,"and it turned out they didn't match Richard the Third at all,"
00:31:11,00:31:12,which is very weird.
00:31:12,00:31:14,It means there must have been a break somewhere
00:31:14,00:31:16,"in the line of succession,"
00:31:16,00:31:18,and so that's incredibly weird.
00:31:18,00:31:20,Does that mean someone was cheating and stuff?
00:31:20,00:31:23,"It means that we suspect there's been some hanky-panky,"
00:31:23,00:31:25,and then there's also another guy today
00:31:25,00:31:27,"who's descended from Geoffrey Count of Anjou,"
00:31:27,00:31:30,"who's basically the founder of the Plantagenet dynasty,"
00:31:30,00:31:32,"and he's who it was named after,"
00:31:32,00:31:35,and that person's DNA doesn't match either of the other two's.
00:31:35,00:31:37,"So, basically, everyone in this dynasty"
00:31:37,00:31:39,"was shacking around different centres, as far as I can tell."
00:31:39,00:31:42,That's really cool. Richard the Third himself.
00:31:42,00:31:46,"He was born with a full set of teeth,"
00:31:46,00:31:49,and he was in the womb for two years.
00:31:49,00:31:51,What? Come on. Wow!
00:31:51,00:31:52,That can't be true.
00:31:52,00:31:56,"Well, these might be propaganda claims from the era."
00:31:56,00:31:59,"Yeah, in fact, there's Shakespearean propaganda claims."
00:31:59,00:32:02,I think it's in the play that he was born with a full set of teeth.
00:32:02,00:32:05,Are they pro or anti in propaganda terms?
00:32:05,00:32:07,What is it? Does it sound like a compliment?
00:32:07,00:32:08,What do you think?
00:32:08,00:32:09,That's pretty cool.
00:32:09,00:32:11,If you've bought a full set of teeth and you're in a mum's...
00:32:11,00:32:12,"Yeah, that's pretty cool."
00:32:12,00:32:15,"And heard his shoulders as well, he was born with."
00:32:15,00:32:18,And it wasn't... I think Shakespeare took it from historians
00:32:18,00:32:24,who immediately after Richard died were coming up with this slander.
00:32:24,00:32:25,"Or maybe it was true, we don't know."
00:32:25,00:32:28,"It's probably untrue, though."
00:32:28,00:32:30,Can I just want to say one good thing about Richard the Third?
00:32:30,00:32:33,Because he gets a bad rep for justifiably.
00:32:33,00:32:35,He was probably a murderer of small boys.
00:32:35,00:32:38,"But on the bright side,"
00:32:38,00:32:42,"he did introduce England's first legal aid system,"
00:32:42,00:32:43,which I didn't know.
00:32:43,00:32:45,"Yeah, so he instigated in his..."
00:32:45,00:32:47,What was a very short reign?
00:32:47,00:32:49,"He was only on the throne about two years, wasn't he?"
00:32:49,00:32:50,- Was he? - Yeah.
00:32:50,00:32:52,Same time he was in the womb. That's insane.
00:32:52,00:32:56,"But yeah, he instigated this thing called the Court of Request."
00:32:56,00:33:00,"That meant that if you couldn't afford legal aid or legal representation,"
00:33:00,00:33:02,then you could get it. It would be provided by the state.
00:33:02,00:33:03,It was very ahead of its time.
00:33:03,00:33:04,- Yeah. - That's pretty cool.
00:33:04,00:33:05,He founded a council of the North
00:33:05,00:33:08,to ensure that the North got representation in government.
00:33:08,00:33:09,- Great. - Yep.
00:33:09,00:33:12,"The only Northern king, really, that we've ever had."
00:33:12,00:33:14,"- A proper Northerner. - I got a really good fact,"
00:33:14,00:33:15,"which I didn't look up, so it might be wrong."
00:33:15,00:33:20,But it's so nice to set the expectations
00:33:20,00:33:22,at the beginning of a damn thing.
00:33:22,00:33:26,"So the third word of the third scene,"
00:33:26,00:33:30,"of the third act, of Richard the Third,"
00:33:30,00:33:31,is fourth.
00:33:31,00:33:38,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:38,00:33:40,I love that fact. That's so good.
00:33:40,00:33:41,- If it's true. - If it's true.
00:33:41,00:33:43,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:43,00:33:45,Have you guys heard of Marmaduke Constable?
00:33:45,00:33:46,"That sounds great, though."
00:33:46,00:33:50,"We were just on, like, relatives of Richard the Third,"
00:33:50,00:33:53,"and this is one of the really close descendants of Richard the Third,"
00:33:53,00:33:55,as in almost contemporary.
00:33:55,00:33:56,"In fact, he was contemporary."
00:33:56,00:33:58,"He was, yeah, his name was Marmaduke Bosworth."
00:33:58,00:34:01,"He fought at the Battle of Bosworth, where Richard was killed."
00:34:01,00:34:05,"He also, and that was the year 1485, just to say,"
00:34:05,00:34:08,he also fought against the Scots at the Battle of Northumberland.
00:34:08,00:34:09,That was in 1513.
00:34:09,00:34:14,He was aged 71 when he took actively part in that battle.
00:34:14,00:34:18,"He only died in 1518, aged about 75 years old,"
00:34:18,00:34:21,when he choked to death drinking a glass of water
00:34:21,00:34:22,which had a frog in it.
00:34:22,00:34:26,[LAUGHTER]
00:34:26,00:34:30,"So Richard the Third died, like you say, in the Battle of Bosworth."
00:34:30,00:34:32,"We've found, you know, we've checked the bones,"
00:34:32,00:34:34,and we reckon that he lost his helmet
00:34:34,00:34:37,"and came under a hail of 11 wounds at the same time,"
00:34:37,00:34:38,and that's what did him in.
00:34:38,00:34:40,"But traditionally, he's supposed to have been killed"
00:34:40,00:34:43,by a soldier called Ralph Rudyard.
00:34:43,00:34:46,Ralph Rudyard's family went on to own a lake in Staffordshire
00:34:46,00:34:48,called Rudyard Lake.
00:34:48,00:34:50,"Rudyard Lake, we've said before,"
00:34:50,00:34:53,is where Rudyard Kipling's name comes from.
00:34:53,00:34:56,"Right, so his parents went there and they really loved it,"
00:34:56,00:34:58,and they thought we'll name him after the lake.
00:34:58,00:35:01,"So Ralph Rudyard's family owned this Rudyard Lake,"
00:35:01,00:35:03,"but they owned two lakes in the area,"
00:35:03,00:35:05,one on each side of a hill.
00:35:05,00:35:08,Rudyard Lake and another one called Titty's Worth.
00:35:08,00:35:10,[LAUGHTER]
00:35:10,00:35:12,So that means that Rudyard Kipling
00:35:12,00:35:15,could so easily have been called Titty's Worth Kipling.
00:35:15,00:35:18,[LAUGHTER]
00:35:18,00:35:20,That's really great.
00:35:20,00:35:22,Can I quickly go back to Cherry King a second?
00:35:22,00:35:23,"Yeah, sure."
00:35:23,00:35:25,I just want to say there's been an interesting thing
00:35:25,00:35:27,that's been in the news recently.
00:35:27,00:35:29,So there's actually a movie that's just been made.
00:35:29,00:35:32,Steve Coogan has made a movie of the story
00:35:32,00:35:35,"of Philippa Langley finding Richard III,"
00:35:35,00:35:38,"and in it, the sort of plot line is that"
00:35:38,00:35:40,"she has this psychic intuition,"
00:35:40,00:35:43,and the scientists and archaeologists and geneticists in it
00:35:43,00:35:45,are kind of portrayed in that classic way
00:35:45,00:35:48,"of being really rational and really unkind,"
00:35:48,00:35:50,and they're really pissed off because they weren't.
00:35:50,00:35:53,"And if you watch Cherry King, just in case you see that movie"
00:35:53,00:35:55,"and you think, oh, scientists are bad, she's awesome."
00:35:55,00:35:56,She's really cool.
00:35:56,00:35:58,She's found incredible stuff as a geneticist.
00:35:58,00:36:01,So she goes around doing DNA for all these finds.
00:36:01,00:36:03,"When she was trying to find out about Vikings,"
00:36:03,00:36:07,"she found that many men just came in to give their DNA,"
00:36:07,00:36:11,because apparently most men think they're Viking.
00:36:11,00:36:12,That's the thing.
00:36:12,00:36:15,"She was like, there was no trouble getting volunteers"
00:36:15,00:36:16,"for people saying, are you Viking?"
00:36:16,00:36:18,"Because people are coming and going, well, I definitely am."
00:36:18,00:36:19,So let's prove this.
00:36:19,00:36:21,"Are we sure that a lot of men didn't do it because they thought,"
00:36:21,00:36:24,maybe they'll give me an iPad and some free porn for half an hour.
00:36:24,00:36:26,And that's how I'm donating my DNA.
00:36:26,00:36:28,Was that how you donate your DNA?
00:36:28,00:36:29,I don't think so.
00:36:29,00:36:30,I thought it was a cheek swab.
00:36:30,00:36:32,I'm saying that's what they thought.
00:36:32,00:36:33,OK.
00:36:33,00:36:35,"Well, thank God you clarified that."
00:36:35,00:36:38,"Otherwise, you would have been straight down there."
00:36:38,00:36:40,"Yeah, and if I'm giving you a call when I'm in jail,"
00:36:40,00:36:42,because I took my dick out during a...
00:36:42,00:36:44,It was meant to be a cheek swab.
00:36:44,00:36:47,Swab this cheek.
00:36:47,00:36:49,LAUGHTER
00:36:49,00:37:00,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:37:00,00:37:02,and that is Andy.
00:37:02,00:37:05,"My fact is that to establish dominance,"
00:37:05,00:37:07,the sarcastic fringe-head fish
00:37:07,00:37:11,will engage in kissing competitions with rival males.
00:37:11,00:37:14,And here's the fish.
00:37:16,00:37:18,So there's a picture of it on the screen here.
00:37:18,00:37:20,The sarcastic fringe fish.
00:37:20,00:37:22,The sarcastic fringe-head.
00:37:22,00:37:24,They're really bizarre fish.
00:37:24,00:37:25,"Oh, I should give credit for this."
00:37:25,00:37:27,"This was actually sent in to us by @FlockOfWords online,"
00:37:27,00:37:29,so thank you so much.
00:37:29,00:37:31,They're called Neoclinus Blanchardi.
00:37:31,00:37:34,"They live off North America on the Pacific side,"
00:37:34,00:37:37,and they're really ugly-looking.
00:37:37,00:37:39,"They're kind of tiny, little brown fish,"
00:37:39,00:37:41,"and they live in holes, and they jump out,"
00:37:41,00:37:43,"and they go, ""Wah!"" at their prey,"
00:37:43,00:37:46,"like they're kind of these gross, awful fish."
00:37:46,00:37:48,"But the one amazing and beautiful thing about them,"
00:37:48,00:37:50,"they have this enormous mouth,"
00:37:50,00:37:52,"as in their mouth is wider than the entire body,"
00:37:52,00:37:55,"because it's got these huge sort of supporting struts,"
00:37:55,00:37:57,"and they've got big, flappy cheeks,"
00:37:57,00:37:59,"and they can just sort of go, ""Wah!"""
00:37:59,00:38:00,Sounds beautiful.
00:38:00,00:38:03,It's a bit like just to give a visual to the audience.
00:38:03,00:38:05,"It's a bit like, even though it's part of their mouth,"
00:38:05,00:38:09,you remember in Jurassic Park when the dinosaur comes up
00:38:09,00:38:11,"and it suddenly looks, it's looking cute,"
00:38:11,00:38:13,and it spreads those frills.
00:38:13,00:38:16,"It's kind of like that, except that's its mouth, not its frills."
00:38:16,00:38:17,It's really like that.
00:38:17,00:38:19,"And they have this weird, weird ritual"
00:38:19,00:38:22,"where if they are near a rival male,"
00:38:22,00:38:24,"and it's the mating season,"
00:38:24,00:38:26,they will both yawn open
00:38:26,00:38:28,and kind of push their mouths against each other
00:38:28,00:38:30,"to see who's got the bigger mouth,"
00:38:30,00:38:32,and this is the intimidating thing.
00:38:32,00:38:35,"In my experience, that's not what kissing is."
00:38:35,00:38:39,"Maybe I'm doing it wrong,"
00:38:39,00:38:43,"but it's not always like, ""Let's see who has the biggest mouth."""
00:38:43,00:38:45,"Well, I've got some apologies to make"
00:38:45,00:38:49,"because I'm, like, undefeated champion."
00:38:49,00:38:53,"And the smaller male,"
00:38:53,00:38:55,"or the male with the smaller mouth, rather,"
00:38:55,00:38:56,will surrender and leave.
00:38:56,00:38:58,"And they do, but they basically are sort of..."
00:38:58,00:38:59,But it does.
00:38:59,00:39:01,"Because they're both about the same size,"
00:39:01,00:39:03,it does look like they kind of make it out.
00:39:03,00:39:05,"So it's not proper, proper kissing."
00:39:05,00:39:09,"If one has a smaller head, sometimes the bigger mouth"
00:39:09,00:39:12,will be able to fit the smaller one's head inside its mouth.
00:39:12,00:39:13,"Oh, my God, really?"
00:39:13,00:39:15,Which is my memory of year nine discos.
00:39:15,00:39:21,"One thing I couldn't get to the bottom of is,"
00:39:21,00:39:23,"so they do the mouth display,"
00:39:23,00:39:25,the sort of dominance thing.
00:39:25,00:39:27,"If they were to have a fight, then,"
00:39:27,00:39:30,"off the back of that, like, let's now have a fight,"
00:39:30,00:39:33,what is the advantage of having a bigger mouth?
00:39:33,00:39:35,"Other than, obviously, they're a bit bigger,"
00:39:35,00:39:37,but does that mean that they're going to win in a fight?
00:39:37,00:39:39,Not really. They actually almost never have an actual fight.
00:39:39,00:39:40,Yeah.
00:39:40,00:39:42,"They will slightly, they might slightly bump into each other,"
00:39:42,00:39:44,"but that's just not the way they do it,"
00:39:44,00:39:45,as in it's not in their repertoire.
00:39:45,00:39:47,It's just like basically going at a year nine disco
00:39:47,00:39:50,"to another guy and then doing your muscles and saying,"
00:39:50,00:39:51,"""Look, my muscles are bigger than you,"
00:39:51,00:39:53,"but I really don't want to fight you."""
00:39:53,00:39:54,OK.
00:39:54,00:39:57,"You guys had crazy year nine discos, you and Anna."
00:39:57,00:39:59,I can't believe you guys went to the year nine disco.
00:39:59,00:40:01,"I wasn't allowed to go, and I..."
00:40:01,00:40:04,"Good news is, it sounds like I missed nothing at all."
00:40:04,00:40:10,"But they do, I mean, these jaws, they have quite sharp teeth,"
00:40:10,00:40:12,"so they can kind of bite and hurt you,"
00:40:12,00:40:15,but they just tend not to do it to each other.
00:40:15,00:40:17,"Like, if you go near their house,"
00:40:17,00:40:20,"they'll do this kind of sort of scary, big, open mouth thing,"
00:40:20,00:40:23,"but then, if you don't go away, they'll actually go for you,"
00:40:23,00:40:25,"and they are, you know, they do have a hefty bite on them."
00:40:25,00:40:27,"Yeah, they'll bite humans, won't they,"
00:40:27,00:40:29,"when you say you, actually you, divers?"
00:40:29,00:40:31,"And that's where sarcastic comes from, by the way,"
00:40:31,00:40:33,"'cause we think, you know, does it have, like,"
00:40:33,00:40:36,"some sort of, like, is it like the Anna Tyshinski of fish?"
00:40:36,00:40:40,"But no, it's sarcastic means that it's a Greek word,"
00:40:40,00:40:43,"sarcasmos, and to bite or tear..."
00:40:43,00:40:44,"Oh, is that right?"
00:40:44,00:40:45,Yeah.
00:40:45,00:40:46,"Yeah, right."
00:40:46,00:40:48,It does.
00:40:48,00:40:51,"It comes from, I think, Sarko, its flesh."
00:40:51,00:40:52,So it's to...
00:40:52,00:40:55,"And so, sarcasmain or whatever, to bite flesh."
00:40:55,00:40:57,"And it's where we get sarcophagus,"
00:40:57,00:40:58,"which I'd never thought about,"
00:40:58,00:41:01,"but sarcophagus, Sarko is flesh,"
00:41:01,00:41:04,"and then faggo, faggo, so it means eat, I eat."
00:41:04,00:41:06,So it's flesh-eating.
00:41:06,00:41:08,A sarcophagus is something that's eating your flesh.
00:41:08,00:41:09,Ah.
00:41:09,00:41:10,Gross.
00:41:10,00:41:15,"They have these kind of bright yellow lips, don't they?"
00:41:15,00:41:17,"The people in here can see them just about, I think,"
00:41:17,00:41:19,"but for the people at home,"
00:41:19,00:41:21,"you kind of have really bright yellow lips,"
00:41:21,00:41:23,"and then on the inside, it's kind of a little bit colourful,"
00:41:23,00:41:24,but not really.
00:41:24,00:41:27,"But in actual fact, those bits on the inside of the mouth"
00:41:27,00:41:29,reflect ultraviolet light.
00:41:29,00:41:32,"So to anyone under the sea that can see ultraviolet light,"
00:41:32,00:41:34,"which is a lot and a lot of fish can see it,"
00:41:34,00:41:37,"actually, that also looks like there's a massive sort of disco"
00:41:37,00:41:38,coming out of his mouth.
00:41:38,00:41:40,Right.
00:41:40,00:41:41,They are so cool.
00:41:41,00:41:42,It does look...
00:41:42,00:41:44,I think that it's very beautiful with its mouth open.
00:41:44,00:41:45,It looks like...
00:41:45,00:41:47,It really reminds me of having your face painted at a fair.
00:41:47,00:41:51,It looks like a kid's gone mad with face paint on them.
00:41:51,00:41:55,Their mouths are so big that it's possible they struggle to eat.
00:41:55,00:41:57,And that sounds bizarre.
00:41:57,00:41:58,Really?
00:41:58,00:42:00,They're a particular kind of fish called a blenny.
00:42:00,00:42:02,"There's a huge, great family of fish."
00:42:02,00:42:05,"And they are tube blenny, which live in tubes."
00:42:05,00:42:08,And most tube blenny feed on small plankton.
00:42:08,00:42:10,"But the male sarcastic fringe head,"
00:42:10,00:42:13,its mouth is so big that it can't suck anymore.
00:42:13,00:42:17,So it seems to struggle a bit sometimes to eat plankton.
00:42:17,00:42:20,It's sort of filtered in because it's just got this huge grip.
00:42:20,00:42:21,Yes.
00:42:21,00:42:22,It's like when your...
00:42:22,00:42:25,"If your toilet's clogged and you need to use a plunger,"
00:42:25,00:42:29,but sometimes the plunger head is too big to get suction on the actual whole bit.
00:42:29,00:42:31,And so it's a pointless suction plan.
00:42:31,00:42:36,I don't think anyone was actually struggling to grip the original point.
00:42:36,00:42:38,But thank you so much.
00:42:38,00:42:40,Glad to help.
00:42:40,00:42:42,"But now all you've done is connected our minds,"
00:42:42,00:42:44,opening our mouths with a blocked toilet.
00:42:44,00:42:46,And we've all gone to the same place.
00:42:46,00:42:47,Blenny's not...
00:42:47,00:42:48,"Yeah, they're a huge family, aren't they?"
00:42:48,00:42:51,There are so many cool fish in the blenny family.
00:42:51,00:42:56,But one of the things they have is they have the only fish that suckles its young.
00:42:56,00:43:01,"So the only thing on our show that suckles like we do, yeah, the Viviparis eel pout."
00:43:01,00:43:06,"So Viviparis being, you know, they give birth to live young, hence that name."
00:43:06,00:43:10,"But when they're pregnant and they have six-month-long pregnancies, which is pretty..."
00:43:10,00:43:12,"Oh, it's a quarter the length of Richard the Third."
00:43:12,00:43:14,"Yeah, absolutely, yeah."
00:43:14,00:43:16,Is that long for a fish?
00:43:16,00:43:17,"It's long, yeah, yeah."
00:43:17,00:43:18,It's good for a fish.
00:43:18,00:43:21,"Usually the bigger the animal, the longer the gestation period."
00:43:21,00:43:23,"OK, and these are like 30 centimetres, right?"
00:43:23,00:43:24,"Yeah, yeah, they're long."
00:43:24,00:43:29,"But the way they suckle is inside, they sort of live in the ovaries."
00:43:29,00:43:30,They don't have a separate uterus.
00:43:30,00:43:32,And they've got ovarian follicles.
00:43:32,00:43:37,"And each little fish embryo suckles on a follicle, one inside the fish."
00:43:37,00:43:39,And there are up to 400 of them.
00:43:39,00:43:44,So imagine it's like you've got 400 breasts and a baby on every one in there.
00:43:44,00:43:45,Wow!
00:43:45,00:43:46,That's amazing.
00:43:46,00:43:48,"A massive mouth, yeah."
00:43:48,00:43:49,Yeah.
00:43:49,00:43:53,"There was a website called World Wide Words, I don't know if you guys have seen it."
00:43:53,00:43:55,"It's online, it's a really, really good website."
00:43:55,00:44:00,"They've collected a list of animals with names that are suggestive of emotion,"
00:44:00,00:44:03,of which the sarcastic fringe head is one of them.
00:44:03,00:44:07,"So there's a few here, the festive midget."
00:44:07,00:44:11,That's the species of moth that's found in North America.
00:44:11,00:44:14,The confused flower beetle.
00:44:14,00:44:19,"That's confused because it looks a bit like another kind of beetle,"
00:44:19,00:44:22,"not just walking around, not knowing what's going on."
00:44:22,00:44:24,And the depressed mussel.
00:44:24,00:44:25,Wow!
00:44:25,00:44:27,They call that because they have a flat shell.
00:44:27,00:44:30,All mussels seem kind of depressed to me.
00:44:30,00:44:34,"I mostly see them actually on a plate, so that doesn't make sense."
00:44:34,00:44:36,Have you heard of the tetra fish?
00:44:36,00:44:40,I'm just going on general fish mating and aggression displays now.
00:44:40,00:44:41,Tetra fish is unbelievable.
00:44:41,00:44:43,Sailfin tetras.
00:44:43,00:44:47,"So there are dominant males, and there are also smaller, more feeble males."
00:44:47,00:44:50,Both of them are competing for the attention of females.
00:44:50,00:44:54,"The dominant ones, you would think, they're very active."
00:44:54,00:44:56,"In fact, they do nothing."
00:44:56,00:44:59,They hide in some sort of kelp.
00:44:59,00:45:01,"Kelp, thank you."
00:45:01,00:45:02,They just hide.
00:45:02,00:45:05,"So the low-ranking males have the run of the place, right?"
00:45:05,00:45:07,And they do all these mating displays.
00:45:07,00:45:10,And they're trying to persuade the female that they're a good prospect
00:45:10,00:45:12,and they're good to have sex with.
00:45:12,00:45:16,"And they do days and days of work persuading the female to have sex, right?"
00:45:16,00:45:19,"And when they have finally got the female to agree,"
00:45:19,00:45:22,"and they're going off to the mating zone,"
00:45:22,00:45:25,a more dominant male will just emerge from the kelp
00:45:25,00:45:29,"and say, ""Thank you very much. I'll take it from here."""
00:45:29,00:45:32,And the female just goes off with him every time.
00:45:32,00:45:35,"She's like, ""Right, I'm now in the mood, and here's an even better offer."""
00:45:35,00:45:37,That was my urinine disco.
00:45:38,00:45:41,And this is a thing called courtship piracy.
00:45:41,00:45:44,And the dominant males are just finding good hiding places
00:45:44,00:45:47,"right near the mating zone, and then just popping out of the last minute."
00:45:47,00:45:50,"Why do they keep doing it, the little nerd ones?"
00:45:50,00:45:52,They just accept it. It's so weird.
00:45:52,00:45:53,They never fight.
00:45:53,00:45:55,"Well, maybe occasionally they get lucky."
00:45:55,00:45:56,"Yeah, exactly."
00:45:56,00:45:59,"Yeah, they must hope that somewhere in the kelp there's no..."
00:45:59,00:46:02,It must just be like kind of looking in all the kelp and stuff.
00:46:02,00:46:04,There's definitely none there.
00:46:04,00:46:06,"Exactly, yeah."
00:46:06,00:46:10,"Female brown trouts, they fake orgasms."
00:46:10,00:46:11,"Oh, yeah."
00:46:11,00:46:13,So it's kind of a similar thing.
00:46:13,00:46:18,"So what will happen is, if a male and a female trouter are having sex,"
00:46:18,00:46:21,"by which I mean one laying eggs and the other one spawning over it,"
00:46:21,00:46:25,then another male or other males might come in the area.
00:46:25,00:46:27,"They might kind of turn up and say, ""I want a bit of that."""
00:46:27,00:46:30,"Would you say, ""Come in the area?"" Do you mean they might?"
00:46:30,00:46:32,We might get to that.
00:46:32,00:46:37,"So what they'll often do is the female brown trout will kind of meet up with a male,"
00:46:37,00:46:40,"who she's kind of not sure about, she's kind of fancies but not sure,"
00:46:40,00:46:44,and then they'll do this sort of shuddering thing.
00:46:44,00:46:47,"They'll both shudder, and usually when they both shudder,"
00:46:47,00:46:50,the females release the eggs and the males release the sperm.
00:46:50,00:46:54,"But actually, often the females will kind of hold onto their eggs while they're doing that,"
00:46:54,00:46:58,"because they know that other males in the area will turn up,"
00:46:58,00:47:02,"and then the other males will fight with the guy she was supposedly shagging,"
00:47:02,00:47:06,"and then they will all fight, and then hopefully she'll end up with an even better male,"
00:47:06,00:47:08,who she can then actually have sex with.
00:47:08,00:47:10,- Nice. - That is ingenious.
00:47:10,00:47:12,"- Smart, isn't it? - That's really smart."
00:47:12,00:47:16,I want to hear what a trout fake orgasm sounds like.
00:47:16,00:47:20,I want to see the when Harry met Sally of the trout world.
00:47:20,00:47:23,"I'll have what she's having, what, some plankton?"
00:47:23,00:47:26,Yes.
00:47:26,00:47:29,- There's one in just sticklebacks. - Yeah.
00:47:29,00:47:31,Male sticklebacks also are very territorial.
00:47:31,00:47:34,"The males fight a lot, and when it's in mating season,"
00:47:34,00:47:37,"and in mating season they go red on their undersides,"
00:47:37,00:47:40,"so the way they spot other males to fight is they see a flash of red,"
00:47:40,00:47:43,"but apparently they're not very good at distinguishing fish from other stuff,"
00:47:43,00:47:47,"so if you've got a pet stickleback, if like a red post fan goes by,"
00:47:47,00:47:50,they'll fling themselves at the side of their tank.
00:47:50,00:47:52,The Welsh football team goes past.
00:47:52,00:47:55,"Yes, exactly. They'll attack them all."
00:47:55,00:47:58,Don't wear red around the sticklebacks.
00:47:58,00:48:00,"Speaking of going red, this is not in fish."
00:48:00,00:48:02,"This is in mandrills, so the primates,"
00:48:02,00:48:07,"but it is about males attacking each other to try and get a female,"
00:48:07,00:48:09,"so they will kind of try and become the alpha male,"
00:48:09,00:48:12,"and if there's an alpha male, then you will fight against them,"
00:48:12,00:48:14,"and if you beat them, you become the alpha male,"
00:48:14,00:48:17,"and if you become the alpha male,"
00:48:17,00:48:20,"immediately, just as this biologically happens,"
00:48:20,00:48:24,"all the sexual skin on your face and genitalia turns red,"
00:48:24,00:48:28,"and the guy who you've beaten, his sexual skin,"
00:48:28,00:48:31,"goes kind of more bluey and less red,"
00:48:31,00:48:34,"and your testicles increase in size,"
00:48:34,00:48:38,"and the person you defeated, their testicles decrease in size."
00:48:38,00:48:39,Really?
00:48:39,00:48:41,It automatically happens as soon as you win the fight.
00:48:41,00:48:44,Popping off to the mandrel tale of the next morning.
00:48:44,00:48:47,"Congratulations on your winning your fight last night, sir."
00:48:47,00:48:50,I'll be expanding the cropped area of these.
00:48:50,00:48:52,That's so good.
00:48:52,00:48:54,What's the sexual skin on your face?
00:48:54,00:48:56,Do we have sexual skin on our face?
00:48:56,00:48:59,"Well, some of us do, Andy, but don't worry about it."
00:48:59,00:49:03,"It means that it changed colour,"
00:49:03,00:49:05,so that secondary sexual characteristics...
00:49:05,00:49:06,"Oh, I think it's amazing to sort of..."
00:49:06,00:49:08,"...like, females find it attractive."
00:49:08,00:49:09,Blushing.
00:49:09,00:49:10,"Blushing, yeah, pretty much."
00:49:10,00:49:11,That's our sexual skin.
00:49:11,00:49:12,"I don't know, man."
00:49:12,00:49:14,"If you've got nothing else to offer, maybe, but..."
00:49:14,00:49:15,Right.
00:49:16,00:49:21,"Because we've got little bits of clitoris in our nose, don't we?"
00:49:21,00:49:22,Excuse me?
00:49:22,00:49:25,"Well, speak for yourself, Dan."
00:49:25,00:49:28,You know how they say that men can't find the clitoris?
00:49:28,00:49:32,I'm pretty sure it's in my own nose.
00:49:32,00:49:39,"Well, I thought, yeah, the inside of the nose is..."
00:49:39,00:49:41,"You have a erectile tissue in your nose,"
00:49:41,00:49:43,but I don't think that's quite the same.
00:49:43,00:49:45,Is that what it is?
00:49:45,00:49:47,That's what I was thinking of.
00:49:47,00:49:49,"When blood will go to it and it will get engorged,"
00:49:49,00:49:53,your poor wife is jamming your fingers up her nose every evening.
00:49:53,00:50:01,Was it good for you?
00:50:01,00:50:03,"Well, it wasn't that good, I have to say."
00:50:03,00:50:12,"Well, I feel like we've all learned a lot tonight."
00:50:12,00:50:16,I'm going to go home and apologize to my wife.
00:50:16,00:50:18,I feel we should all go home as well.
00:50:18,00:50:20,"That's it, that is all of our facts."
