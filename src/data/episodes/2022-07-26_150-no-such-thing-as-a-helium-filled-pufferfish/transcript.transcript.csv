00:00:02,00:00:17,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:17,00:00:19,"of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast"
00:00:19,00:00:22,coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.
00:00:22,00:00:23,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:23,00:00:26,"I am sitting here with James Harkin,"
00:00:26,00:00:28,Anichezinski and Drew Murray.
00:00:28,00:00:31,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones."
00:00:31,00:00:32,"- Can't do it, can't do it."
00:00:32,00:00:34,- I think it's Drew Hunter Murray.
00:00:34,00:00:35,- It's Drew Hunter Murray.
00:00:35,00:00:37,"- It's not that, it's not that."
00:00:37,00:00:38,"I've acetate, we acetate last week."
00:00:38,00:00:40,It's lightning.
00:00:40,00:00:41,I wanna stick with that.
00:00:41,00:00:42,Please never Drew.
00:00:42,00:00:44,- Oh.
00:00:44,00:00:46,- I love Drew's photograph.
00:00:46,00:00:48,"- And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:48,00:00:51,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:00:51,00:00:54,"and in a particular order, here we go."
00:00:54,00:00:57,"Starting with my facts, my fact this week is that"
00:00:57,00:01:00,"in the final years of its construction,"
00:01:00,00:01:03,Mount Rushmore was built by baseball players.
00:01:03,00:01:04,- Nice.
00:01:04,00:01:05,- Did they run out of dynamite?
00:01:05,00:01:08,"And they said, ""Well, we better just get a bunch of guys"
00:01:08,00:01:09,"with bad stuff."""
00:01:09,00:01:10,(laughing)
00:01:10,00:01:13,"No, so Mount Rushmore was constructed"
00:01:13,00:01:17,between 1927 and 1941 in the first early stages
00:01:17,00:01:20,and actually right up until about 1938.
00:01:20,00:01:22,It was being led by a guy called Gutson Borglum
00:01:22,00:01:25,and Gutson Borglum had a sun working on it called Lincoln
00:01:25,00:01:27,and Lincoln was obsessed with baseball
00:01:27,00:01:29,and he really wanted to put a baseball team together.
00:01:29,00:01:33,"So from 1938, when he started hiring all the people"
00:01:33,00:01:35,"to work on it, one of the things that he required you"
00:01:35,00:01:37,to be able to do was play baseball
00:01:37,00:01:39,so that you could be part of the team.
00:01:39,00:01:42,It almost didn't matter if you were able to be
00:01:42,00:01:43,(laughing)
00:01:43,00:01:44,- Is it true?
00:01:44,00:01:46,"Well, one of the guys, his name's Nick Clifford,"
00:01:46,00:01:49,he's the last construction worker on Mount Rushmore
00:01:49,00:01:52,who's still alive and you can meet him in the summers.
00:01:52,00:01:54,"So if you're this year, 2017 in the summer,"
00:01:54,00:01:57,he's 95 years old at the moment.
00:01:57,00:01:59,Go to Mount Rushmore and he sits there
00:01:59,00:02:01,"and he gives tours, he explains what's going on,"
00:02:01,00:02:03,"how they built it, he signs books"
00:02:03,00:02:06,and he hands out baseball cards from the team
00:02:06,00:02:09,and they actually competed in amateur baseball
00:02:09,00:02:11,"and they made it to the semi-finals, they came in third."
00:02:11,00:02:13,So they were really good and...
00:02:13,00:02:14,- The semi-finals of...
00:02:14,00:02:17,"- Of the amateur baseball, no one's heard of League."
00:02:17,00:02:18,(laughing)
00:02:18,00:02:20,- Just in the Mount Rushmore area.
00:02:20,00:02:22,"- Yeah, no, I'm not fully sure on that actually."
00:02:22,00:02:25,"- Actually, it did sound when you read people's memoirs"
00:02:25,00:02:28,"about it, it sounds like they had a really good team work"
00:02:28,00:02:31,"kind of bond, doesn't it, the workers."
00:02:31,00:02:33,So they all had these weird nicknames
00:02:33,00:02:35,so they were all called stuff like
00:02:35,00:02:40,lively and polluca and red and hoot and whiskey.
00:02:40,00:02:40,- And howdy.
00:02:40,00:02:42,"- And howdy, yeah."
00:02:42,00:02:43,- And one guy's called Howdy.
00:02:43,00:02:45,- Did you read the story about what Howdy did
00:02:45,00:02:47,to one of his teammates at one point?
00:02:47,00:02:48,- No.
00:02:48,00:02:50,"- So they played quite a lot of pranks on each other, I think."
00:02:50,00:02:52,So one of their favourite pranks was
00:02:52,00:02:53,"if a new builder came on site,"
00:02:53,00:02:56,"then when he was going up on an out-sale,"
00:02:56,00:02:58,then you'd like loosen it so he'd drop down a few feet
00:02:58,00:03:00,and think he was plummeting to his death.
00:03:00,00:03:02,"- That's bullying, isn't it?"
00:03:02,00:03:04,"- Yeah, but bullying is always funny for the bullies,"
00:03:04,00:03:07,and so I think most of them enjoyed it.
00:03:07,00:03:07,- Okay.
00:03:07,00:03:09,- It was very good nature.
00:03:09,00:03:11,- Who will speak for bullies?
00:03:11,00:03:12,- Hannah will speak for bullies.
00:03:12,00:03:14,(laughing)
00:03:14,00:03:16,"- Hey, I mean, good company these days."
00:03:16,00:03:20,"But no, he did this thing where I think one of his"
00:03:20,00:03:21,co-workers slapped him on the ass or something.
00:03:21,00:03:23,"So to get him back,"
00:03:23,00:03:26,they have an air hose that they used to remove all this
00:03:26,00:03:28,rock dust that was all over them at the end of the day.
00:03:28,00:03:29,They got covered in rock dust.
00:03:29,00:03:32,So it had really powerful blowing force.
00:03:32,00:03:34,And he got this air hose and he shoved it up.
00:03:34,00:03:39,His teammates us and it inflated his teammates in sides.
00:03:39,00:03:41,And everyone thought he was going to die.
00:03:41,00:03:45,So this guy said he blew up tighter than a drum.
00:03:45,00:03:48,"And one of the witnesses said that when the hose connected,"
00:03:48,00:03:50,you could see his belly swell right up.
00:03:50,00:03:53,"He yelled, ""My God, how do you've killed me?"""
00:03:53,00:03:54,And then he had to start passing air
00:03:54,00:03:55,and he passed quite a lot of blood with it.
00:03:55,00:03:57,- If you're listening and you have access to high pressure
00:03:57,00:03:59,"air hoses, do not try this at home."
00:03:59,00:04:04,"- No fatalities of any of the workers on Mount Rushmore,"
00:04:04,00:04:06,despite all the weird pranks that they would play on each other.
00:04:06,00:04:07,- Yeah.
00:04:07,00:04:09,"- So when did you say it was finished, don't?"
00:04:09,00:04:11,- 1941 is when they ran out of funding.
00:04:11,00:04:13,"- Exactly, it's not finished."
00:04:13,00:04:13,- Yeah.
00:04:13,00:04:14,- Someone could still take up the metal.
00:04:14,00:04:15,They're meant to be down to the waist.
00:04:15,00:04:17,But once they've done the faces and the shoulders
00:04:17,00:04:18,"and things, they sort of thought,"
00:04:18,00:04:20,"well, you know who they are."
00:04:20,00:04:22,It's good that they didn't start at the other end.
00:04:22,00:04:23,- You'd start on the waist.
00:04:23,00:04:27,(all laughing)
00:04:27,00:04:29,- Did you read that thing where it's not going to be
00:04:29,00:04:32,"properly finished for 300,000 years?"
00:04:32,00:04:36,That's because the granite erodes.
00:04:36,00:04:38,"And it erodes by a very, very tiny bit."
00:04:38,00:04:40,And the person who was making it knew this.
00:04:40,00:04:43,And so he deliberately made all the faces slightly fatter.
00:04:43,00:04:46,So they'll just keep eroding and keep eroding.
00:04:46,00:04:48,"And then apparently in 300,000 years,"
00:04:48,00:04:50,all the proportions will be correct.
00:04:50,00:04:50,- That's amazing.
00:04:50,00:04:51,- That's incredible.
00:04:51,00:04:54,"- But why did he plan it to be right in 300,000 years"
00:04:54,00:04:56,"rather than just, nah."
00:04:56,00:04:58,"- To go with the 300,000th anniversary"
00:04:58,00:05:00,of the Declaration of Independence.
00:05:00,00:05:01,(all laughing)
00:05:01,00:05:04,"- Well, the thing is that the faces will still be,"
00:05:04,00:05:06,you'll still have the outline of a face
00:05:06,00:05:08,for seven million years before they erode.
00:05:08,00:05:09,- Wow.
00:05:09,00:05:11,"- And I read, this is in futility closet,"
00:05:11,00:05:12,a website I read this.
00:05:12,00:05:15,The noses are about 240 inches long.
00:05:15,00:05:17,It will be 2.4 million years
00:05:17,00:05:20,before it's down to just a flat face.
00:05:20,00:05:22,"If they erode all the way, they'll look like four Voldemort's."
00:05:22,00:05:24,That'd be quite cool.
00:05:24,00:05:25,- Yes.
00:05:25,00:05:26,"So in 2.4 million years,"
00:05:26,00:05:29,they'll think that four of the first presidents of America
00:05:29,00:05:31,"were all Voldemort before, rather than just"
00:05:31,00:05:32,the most recent ones.
00:05:32,00:05:35,(all laughing)
00:05:35,00:05:36,"- They finished the heads at different times, right?"
00:05:36,00:05:37,"'Cause they would,"
00:05:37,00:05:39,"they worked on Washington and then they finished Washington,"
00:05:39,00:05:40,then they started on the next one.
00:05:40,00:05:42,So they had different dedication ceremonies
00:05:42,00:05:46,for each one before they did the whole dedication at the end.
00:05:46,00:05:49,"And before each dedication,"
00:05:49,00:05:51,they would put a massive American flag
00:05:51,00:05:52,"over the president's head,"
00:05:52,00:05:53,and then they'd drop it to reveal.
00:05:53,00:05:54,- Wow.
00:05:54,00:05:56,- Here it is.
00:05:56,00:05:57,- So does that mean people didn't really know
00:05:57,00:05:59,who it was gonna be before they?
00:05:59,00:06:00,- I think I had a hunch.
00:06:00,00:06:01,- Maybe.
00:06:01,00:06:03,"- You know, 90% of it was done with dynamite, Mount Rushmore."
00:06:03,00:06:04,"- Yeah, I think that's amazing."
00:06:04,00:06:07,"- Yeah, and they got to within four inches"
00:06:07,00:06:09,"of the final thing, just using dynamite,"
00:06:09,00:06:10,and then they had to do the check.
00:06:10,00:06:11,"- But the rest was done by hand, wasn't it?"
00:06:11,00:06:12,- Yeah.
00:06:12,00:06:14,"- Like as in, they would make little holes"
00:06:14,00:06:16,and then they just grab it out with their hands.
00:06:16,00:06:17,"- It's like, called honeycoming."
00:06:17,00:06:19,"- We do loads and loads and loads of little holes,"
00:06:19,00:06:20,and then just pull it out.
00:06:20,00:06:22,- I think it's incredible that you would do
00:06:22,00:06:24,"almost all of it with massive dynamite,"
00:06:24,00:06:25,"and the last bit, you would just kind of grab it out"
00:06:25,00:06:26,with your hands.
00:06:26,00:06:28,"- Yeah, that's really cool."
00:06:28,00:06:30,- On the actual baseball card that you can buy
00:06:30,00:06:33,"of Nick,"
00:06:33,00:06:35,- Contracted to the baseball last well.
00:06:35,00:06:39,He's actually holding one of the honeycomb devices
00:06:39,00:06:40,on the front.
00:06:40,00:06:41,"As an old man, he's holding it."
00:06:41,00:06:43,So they've still got the original ones there.
00:06:43,00:06:44,- That's really cool.
00:06:44,00:06:44,- Yeah.
00:06:44,00:06:46,- I do get the feeling you're more interested
00:06:46,00:06:48,in the baseball side of this than the monuments side of them.
00:06:48,00:06:50,"- Well, I just thought, yeah, I think it's pretty,"
00:06:50,00:06:52,"I mean, they clearly are as well."
00:06:52,00:06:53,If you go to the local cafe
00:06:53,00:06:57,on all of their trays is the story of the baseball team.
00:06:57,00:06:58,- They don't even point out the mountain to you.
00:06:58,00:07:01,- There is some barris that that's the focus point.
00:07:01,00:07:04,"- Do they have, have they recovered it with those flags?"
00:07:04,00:07:06,"- Originally, it was not gonna be any president"
00:07:06,00:07:07,on Mount Rushmore.
00:07:07,00:07:08,It was just gonna be a mountain.
00:07:08,00:07:09,- No.
00:07:09,00:07:11,- That's how God intended it.
00:07:11,00:07:13,"- So the original plan,"
00:07:13,00:07:16,before they got a burglum on board
00:07:16,00:07:20,was to have sort of figures from the American West.
00:07:20,00:07:23,So maybe Chief Red Cloud Buffalo Bill
00:07:23,00:07:24,"and Lewis and Clark, the two explorers,"
00:07:24,00:07:27,"who explored a load around there,"
00:07:27,00:07:29,and then cuts on to cover.
00:07:29,00:07:32,"And he said, ""There's absolutely no way"
00:07:32,00:07:35,I'm spending my life's work on these non-entities.
00:07:35,00:07:37,"It's gonna be presidents or nothing."""
00:07:37,00:07:39,And he insisted and they did change the plan.
00:07:39,00:07:41,"- Yeah, I have a baseball facts for you, Dan."
00:07:41,00:07:43,"- Oh, great."
00:07:43,00:07:46,"So during the war, during the Cold War,"
00:07:46,00:07:50,America wanted to make a surveillance tunnel in Berlin.
00:07:50,00:07:52,They needed to get something on the floor
00:07:52,00:07:55,"on the other side that they could use as a marker,"
00:07:55,00:07:56,which is where the tunnel would go to.
00:07:56,00:07:59,And so what they would do is they'd play baseball
00:07:59,00:08:01,right near the wall and deliberately hit the ball over.
00:08:01,00:08:04,So the ball landed there and then they'd be able to survey it
00:08:04,00:08:06,and be able to see where the ball is and use that as a marker.
00:08:06,00:08:07,- Wow.
00:08:07,00:08:09,"- So it's like, can we not have a ball back, please?"
00:08:09,00:08:11,"- Yeah, exactly that."
00:08:11,00:08:14,And what happened was the Germans were just too kind
00:08:14,00:08:16,and they just kept going and collecting the ball back.
00:08:16,00:08:19,"- I couldn't do that sort of, so they could never do it."
00:08:19,00:08:21,"- Oh, that's awesome, that's so good."
00:08:21,00:08:26,"- Like a dog, like an annoying dog in World War II."
00:08:26,00:08:29,"And also on baseball, the Americans designed a grenade"
00:08:29,00:08:31,that was exactly the same shape and size
00:08:31,00:08:32,and weight as a baseball.
00:08:32,00:08:35,So the Americans could throw it easily.
00:08:35,00:08:36,"Think, didn't they?"
00:08:36,00:08:37,"It was called the bino, really?"
00:08:37,00:08:39,"- Yeah, and that was to make it because it was,"
00:08:39,00:08:40,and it was supposed to be thrown like a baseball
00:08:40,00:08:41,and then it exploded on impact.
00:08:41,00:08:43,- Was it painted as well to look like a baseball
00:08:43,00:08:45,and had stitching on it like a baseball?
00:08:45,00:08:46,- Yeah.
00:08:46,00:08:48,- Was there an amusing mix up at any point with these things?
00:08:48,00:08:49,- Yeah.
00:08:49,00:08:52,"- Yeah, maybe it's like Christmas and they get in the trenches"
00:08:52,00:08:54,"and they're like, okay, let's play football."
00:08:54,00:08:56,"No, no, let's play baseball."
00:08:56,00:08:57,I brought my own ball.
00:08:57,00:09:02,- According to a medical report published in 1977
00:09:02,00:09:04,"and the diseases of colon and rectum,"
00:09:04,00:09:07,a 49-year-old man was admitted to San Francisco hospital
00:09:07,00:09:09,complaining of severe pain.
00:09:09,00:09:12,"A firm, fixed round object was found to be lodged"
00:09:12,00:09:14,high in his rectum.
00:09:14,00:09:16,The man then admitted that he and his sexual partner
00:09:16,00:09:19,had celebrated the Oakland Day's World Series win
00:09:19,00:09:22,by having a baseball inserted into his anus.
00:09:22,00:09:24,(laughing)
00:09:24,00:09:26,- Oh my God.
00:09:26,00:09:28,- Could have been worse.
00:09:28,00:09:29,- Could have been a bat.
00:09:29,00:09:30,(laughing)
00:09:30,00:09:33,(upbeat music)
00:09:33,00:09:38,"- Okay, this time for fact number two"
00:09:38,00:09:40,and that is James.
00:09:40,00:09:44,"- Okay, my fact this week is that on some train journeys"
00:09:44,00:09:47,in China passengers are forced to take it in turns
00:09:47,00:09:49,to use the seats so that everyone gets a chance
00:09:49,00:09:52,to sit down for some of the journey.
00:09:52,00:09:53,(groaning)
00:09:53,00:09:53,"That's good, isn't it?"
00:09:53,00:09:54,- Yeah.
00:09:54,00:09:56,- It has the southern rail of countries China.
00:09:56,00:09:57,(laughing)
00:09:57,00:10:01,"- So this is the Spring Festival, Chinese New Year,"
00:10:01,00:10:03,which is happening at the moment
00:10:03,00:10:07,and it's the biggest migration of humans in the world.
00:10:07,00:10:10,There's like three billion people making journeys
00:10:10,00:10:15,around China and while China infrastructure is pretty good
00:10:15,00:10:18,"and it's getting better, it's still that's way too many people"
00:10:18,00:10:21,to be moving around and there's only so many trains
00:10:21,00:10:23,you can have and they sell these tickets
00:10:23,00:10:25,and a lot of the journeys are quite long
00:10:25,00:10:27,and so they make a rule where everyone gets to sit down
00:10:27,00:10:28,for a little bit.
00:10:28,00:10:29,But I think that's quite a good rule actually.
00:10:29,00:10:30,"- Yeah, that's great."
00:10:30,00:10:31,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:10:31,00:10:33,- How many journeys did you second made?
00:10:33,00:10:34,- I've said three billion.
00:10:34,00:10:36,"- Yeah, there's three billion journeys, isn't it?"
00:10:36,00:10:37,Not three billion people.
00:10:37,00:10:38,- That's amazing.
00:10:38,00:10:39,- You have to go there and you have to come back
00:10:39,00:10:40,and then you might have to change a bit.
00:10:40,00:10:41,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:10:41,00:10:44,I wonder if a change counts still as one journey though
00:10:44,00:10:45,"'cause it does when you play a ticket, isn't it?"
00:10:45,00:10:47,- Did you see that thing in the news?
00:10:47,00:10:49,I think it was today or yesterday where
00:10:49,00:10:52,say you're buying a ticket from London to Bolton.
00:10:52,00:10:54,Then you would have to pay a certain amount of money
00:10:54,00:10:56,but you go on this website and you say where you want to go
00:10:56,00:10:58,and it splits it all up so you might go
00:10:58,00:11:01,"London to Watford, Watford to Milton Keynes,"
00:11:01,00:11:05,"Milton Keyes to Birmingham, Birmingham to Stoke Stoke to Bolton"
00:11:05,00:11:07,and it works out the cost of all those
00:11:07,00:11:08,and you can save a load of money.
00:11:08,00:11:11,A lot of football fans from the FA Cup were using it
00:11:11,00:11:12,and they all saved a ton of money.
00:11:12,00:11:13,"- Oh yeah, I saw that."
00:11:13,00:11:14,- You went on the news this morning.
00:11:14,00:11:15,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:11:15,00:11:16,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:11:16,00:11:18,- A guy had 52 tickets from one return journey
00:11:18,00:11:19,to a football match.
00:11:19,00:11:20,- 'Cause you need a ticket for each one
00:11:20,00:11:22,of these tiny little things
00:11:22,00:11:24,and so he just has a massive envelope full of tons
00:11:24,00:11:26,"of tickets and whether ticker inspector comes,"
00:11:26,00:11:29,"you're like, okay, it's definitely one of these."
00:11:29,00:11:30,- That's amazing.
00:11:30,00:11:30,- Apparently that is true.
00:11:30,00:11:32,Although I think they're gonna try and make
00:11:32,00:11:34,all their tickets a bit easier
00:11:34,00:11:35,than that news article I read.
00:11:35,00:11:37,"They're gonna change a lot of the tickets, aren't they?"
00:11:37,00:11:39,There's something like three million different possible
00:11:39,00:11:41,tickets you can buy in the UK
00:11:41,00:11:43,and the majority of them have never been bought by anyone.
00:11:43,00:11:44,- No way.
00:11:44,00:11:45,"- There's something like that, yeah."
00:11:45,00:11:47,"Anyway, this isn't about trains."
00:11:47,00:11:49,This is about the Chinese movements of people.
00:11:49,00:11:50,- Oh yeah.
00:11:50,00:11:51,- So one thing about Chinese New Year
00:11:51,00:11:55,is that it's very confusing that it's called Spring.
00:11:55,00:11:56,It's called the Spring Festival
00:11:56,00:11:58,because it's obviously in winter.
00:11:58,00:12:00,"- It's supposed to be like the start of spring, isn't it?"
00:12:00,00:12:02,"- Yeah, but it doesn't feel right."
00:12:02,00:12:03,- It's so optimistic.
00:12:03,00:12:06,"So I think China divides the year into,"
00:12:06,00:12:08,is it 20 sections which have different names
00:12:08,00:12:11,and then there's one section which is the first section
00:12:11,00:12:13,of the year which is start of spring
00:12:13,00:12:16,and that runs for a couple of weeks in mid February.
00:12:16,00:12:18,And so this is called Spring Festival
00:12:18,00:12:19,'cause I think it's the festival that comes
00:12:19,00:12:22,just on the cusp of start of spring period.
00:12:22,00:12:23,- Right.
00:12:23,00:12:24,"- Which is just, I mean, it's not spring."
00:12:24,00:12:26,It's sweet that they're convincing themselves that it is.
00:12:26,00:12:27,- And it's called Chinese New Year.
00:12:27,00:12:28,It doesn't even have a new year.
00:12:28,00:12:30,It doesn't even have in first January.
00:12:30,00:12:31,- It's going on.
00:12:32,00:12:33,- Don't you grow up there.
00:12:33,00:12:34,What's this all about?
00:12:34,00:12:36,- What's the deal with Chinese New Year?
00:12:36,00:12:38,- Did you do the thing where you give each other
00:12:38,00:12:39,envelopes with money?
00:12:39,00:12:40,"- Yeah, Lycee, it's called."
00:12:40,00:12:42,Or I'd probably pronounce that slightly wrong
00:12:42,00:12:45,"but you used to say Gongsi Fatalai, Sitala,"
00:12:45,00:12:48,and they would give you a red packet with money inside
00:12:48,00:12:50,and it was living in Hong Kong
00:12:50,00:12:52,which was a very affluent place.
00:12:52,00:12:54,It was amazing 'cause everyone gave you these packets
00:12:54,00:12:56,and it was the time to make money if you were a kid.
00:12:56,00:12:58,You would just walk around and walk up to adults
00:12:58,00:13:01,and say Gongsi Fatalai and they'd just give you a red packet.
00:13:01,00:13:02,"And it was, yeah, yeah."
00:13:02,00:13:04,"So if you went to a party, it was incredible."
00:13:04,00:13:06,It was like the tooth fairy went nuts
00:13:06,00:13:08,and everyone revealed themselves to be that person
00:13:08,00:13:10,and they're just handing you money.
00:13:10,00:13:11,- Is it just a kid?
00:13:11,00:13:12,'Cause I thought it was everyone
00:13:12,00:13:13,and then I thought at the end of the day
00:13:13,00:13:14,you'd end up equal.
00:13:14,00:13:15,- I left and I was a kid.
00:13:15,00:13:16,So yeah.
00:13:16,00:13:17,"- You left a new, you stayed."
00:13:17,00:13:18,Got all the money.
00:13:18,00:13:21,While still a child fled the scene of the crime.
00:13:21,00:13:24,- Very crafty.
00:13:24,00:13:26,"Just on the, everyone traveling everywhere"
00:13:26,00:13:27,"for Chinese New Year, there has been a story"
00:13:27,00:13:30,in the news last week about one guy
00:13:30,00:13:32,who started cycling home
00:13:32,00:13:34,"'cause he was very poor, couldn't afford a train ticket,"
00:13:34,00:13:35,couldn't afford a plane.
00:13:35,00:13:38,So he started cycling really early
00:13:38,00:13:41,"and he cycled for 30 days, he went 300 miles."
00:13:41,00:13:42,"So 10 miles a day, it was not great."
00:13:42,00:13:44,"But, okay, maybe it's a bad bike."
00:13:44,00:13:46,"Anyway, he then found out."
00:13:46,00:13:47,- Rocky Turin.
00:13:47,00:13:48,"- Yeah, it was gonna be a Rocky Turin."
00:13:48,00:13:49,"Exactly, anyway, he then found out"
00:13:49,00:13:51,he'd be going the wrong direction for 300 miles.
00:13:51,00:13:52,(laughing)
00:13:52,00:13:53,- No.
00:13:53,00:13:55,"- Yeah, well, I don't know"
00:13:55,00:13:58,because he was trying to travel 1000 miles supposedly
00:13:58,00:14:00,and it meant that he would have had to take three months
00:14:00,00:14:01,to get home.
00:14:01,00:14:05,"So, I can't quite believe it."
00:14:05,00:14:06,But apparently he'd been living in internet cafes
00:14:06,00:14:07,'cause he was really broke.
00:14:07,00:14:09,"- Yeah, but maybe he thought"
00:14:09,00:14:11,"that it was gonna get more than 10 miles a day, probably."
00:14:11,00:14:12,"- Probably, yeah."
00:14:12,00:14:14,- Didn't bank on that Rocky Turin and the bad bike.
00:14:14,00:14:16,(laughing)
00:14:16,00:14:19,"- Anyway, this was reported in the China People's Daily,"
00:14:19,00:14:21,an organization I have no reason to mistrust.
00:14:21,00:14:23,- I remember reading that as well.
00:14:23,00:14:25,And the idea was that he kept asking people
00:14:25,00:14:27,which way to go and they all started telling
00:14:27,00:14:28,in the wrong direction.
00:14:28,00:14:30,(laughing)
00:14:30,00:14:32,"- If you kept asking them, presumably,"
00:14:32,00:14:34,he'd just have gone back and forth over the same 10 miles
00:14:34,00:14:35,to get it again and again.
00:14:35,00:14:37,(laughing)
00:14:37,00:14:40,"- Just, can I just say something about crowded trains?"
00:14:40,00:14:42,"This is kind of about 'cause I didn't know this was a thing,"
00:14:42,00:14:47,"but in Japan, in Tokyo, they have pushers at stations"
00:14:47,00:14:50,"which are people to, I think they're called Oshia"
00:14:50,00:14:53,and they're people to push people onto crowded trains.
00:14:53,00:14:56,And someone described it as perfectly happily.
00:14:56,00:14:57,"Someone who's been pushed by a person said,"
00:14:57,00:14:59,"""It's like if you had a big laundry basket"
00:14:59,00:15:01,"""and it's overflowing, you just full stuff in there."""
00:15:01,00:15:03,"- You can see footage of this on YouTube,"
00:15:03,00:15:06,if you look it up and it's extraordinary.
00:15:06,00:15:09,"It's a, there's no more space like literally to even breathe"
00:15:09,00:15:12,and you've got people shoving like crazy
00:15:12,00:15:13,to get those doors closed.
00:15:13,00:15:14,It's astonishing.
00:15:14,00:15:15,"- And they pull people off as well, don't they?"
00:15:15,00:15:16,- That's a bit much.
00:15:16,00:15:18,(laughing)
00:15:18,00:15:19,- Yeah.
00:15:19,00:15:20,- How much do you have to give them in a red envelope to do that?
00:15:20,00:15:22,(laughing)
00:15:22,00:15:24,"- No, they're called polar offers sometimes."
00:15:24,00:15:25,"- No, they're not."
00:15:25,00:15:27,- I've seen them called polar offers.
00:15:27,00:15:28,"- Mm, I'm sure."
00:15:28,00:15:29,- Wow.
00:15:29,00:15:30,"- We used to have, in Hong Kong,"
00:15:30,00:15:34,"you used to be able to, in some cases, get your own carriage"
00:15:34,00:15:36,if you were Western because of the number four.
00:15:36,00:15:39,So the superstition and number four is so great
00:15:39,00:15:40,that a lot of people wouldn't get anything
00:15:40,00:15:42,that had the number four on it.
00:15:42,00:15:44,- 'Cause it sounds like the word for death is that it?
00:15:44,00:15:46,"- Which is death and yeah, it's the number four."
00:15:46,00:15:49,"So if, say, a cable car that had number four on it"
00:15:49,00:15:51,"would be empty and so if you were,"
00:15:51,00:15:53,"if they could see a Western family,"
00:15:53,00:15:55,"they would go, come on out, and skip the two."
00:15:55,00:15:57,"- Please, please, get into the death carriage."
00:15:57,00:15:59,(laughing)
00:15:59,00:16:03,- Yeah.
00:16:03,00:16:06,"- In 2005, this is the period when everyone's going"
00:16:06,00:16:08,"is known as Chunyun, I think."
00:16:08,00:16:09,- Yeah.
00:16:09,00:16:13,"- So in the 2005 Chunyun period, the train offices"
00:16:13,00:16:17,"had certainly less than 100 phone lines,"
00:16:17,00:16:18,"more than 10, but less than 100."
00:16:18,00:16:21,So somewhere in the tens of phone lines
00:16:21,00:16:25,and they were getting 19.91 million calls per hour.
00:16:25,00:16:27,(laughing)
00:16:27,00:16:31,- You are number 10 million and 12 in the queue.
00:16:31,00:16:37,"- Just one last thing, it's the Chinese year of the Cockrole"
00:16:37,00:16:39,that's just started.
00:16:39,00:16:40,That's 2017.
00:16:40,00:16:43,"Obviously it's every, what is it, every 12?"
00:16:43,00:16:45,- 12 years until you return to your animal.
00:16:45,00:16:50,- So one of them was 1945 and 1945 was the first time
00:16:50,00:16:54,that the cartoon character Foghorn Leghorn was ever voiced.
00:16:54,00:16:57,So here's a year of the Cockrole character.
00:16:57,00:16:58,"- Oh, that's good."
00:16:58,00:17:01,"- And also, have you heard of Mike the headless chicken?"
00:17:01,00:17:02,- Yeah.
00:17:02,00:17:03,- Must have done.
00:17:03,00:17:05,He was the guy who there was a family in America
00:17:05,00:17:07,and they were chopping the heads off chickens
00:17:07,00:17:09,and one of them stayed alive and ran around
00:17:09,00:17:13,for a couple of years and he was born also in 1945.
00:17:13,00:17:16,So he was also a year of the Cockrole guy.
00:17:16,00:17:18,"- Oh, very nice."
00:17:18,00:17:20,"- You know that all very arrogant though,"
00:17:20,00:17:22,"the year of the Cockrole types, the roosters"
00:17:22,00:17:24,"and this year of the roosters, the year of the vein,"
00:17:24,00:17:26,the arrogant and the emotionally volatile.
00:17:26,00:17:27,- What are you?
00:17:27,00:17:29,- I am a tiger.
00:17:29,00:17:31,- What's your Chinese New Year side?
00:17:31,00:17:33,(laughing)
00:17:33,00:17:34,- It's interesting.
00:17:34,00:17:36,So what the description you just made
00:17:36,00:17:39,is taken very seriously back in China
00:17:39,00:17:42,and there were certain years where pregnancy rates
00:17:42,00:17:45,are extremely low because it's a very bad year
00:17:45,00:17:47,and I wish I could remember of the top of my head.
00:17:47,00:17:49,- And the year of the loser.
00:17:49,00:17:49,- But you have.
00:17:49,00:17:51,(laughing)
00:17:51,00:17:54,(upbeat music)
00:17:54,00:17:59,"- Okay, it's time for fact number three"
00:17:59,00:18:01,and that is Drew.
00:18:01,00:18:02,(laughing)
00:18:02,00:18:07,"- Oh, this is the worst new name I've ever had."
00:18:07,00:18:09,I went to an old boy school for 11 years.
00:18:09,00:18:10,(laughing)
00:18:10,00:18:12,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three"
00:18:12,00:18:14,and that is Lightning.
00:18:14,00:18:16,(laughing)
00:18:16,00:18:18,- My fact is that the moon has been collecting
00:18:18,00:18:21,tiny bits of earth for the last three billion years.
00:18:21,00:18:22,(laughing)
00:18:22,00:18:23,- Collecting.
00:18:23,00:18:24,- Collecting.
00:18:24,00:18:25,- Like a baseball card.
00:18:25,00:18:26,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:18:26,00:18:28,- Exactly what we're gonna do with them.
00:18:28,00:18:30,"- It's going to, it's got an album"
00:18:30,00:18:32,and it does swapsies with Venus.
00:18:32,00:18:35,(laughing)
00:18:35,00:18:36,"- Yeah, this is really, really cool."
00:18:36,00:18:39,So there's a new discovery which has been published
00:18:39,00:18:41,in nature which is that the moon is dusted
00:18:41,00:18:43,in this fine layer of oxygen
00:18:43,00:18:46,and it was a bit of a puzzle as to how it had got there.
00:18:46,00:18:49,And it turns out that earth basically has a tail
00:18:49,00:18:53,of ions and atoms and electrons and things like this
00:18:53,00:18:56,which lashes out into space behind it.
00:18:56,00:18:56,- Wow.
00:18:56,00:18:58,- And normally the moon doesn't get any of it
00:18:58,00:19:01,"but sometimes when the sun, the earth and the moon"
00:19:01,00:19:04,"are all lined up together, the moon is shielded"
00:19:04,00:19:06,"from the solar wind, right?"
00:19:06,00:19:09,And then it gets a bit of a lashing of oxygen atoms.
00:19:09,00:19:12,So the really cool thing is that we don't have much evidence
00:19:12,00:19:14,"of very, very early life on earth"
00:19:14,00:19:16,like the first bacteria.
00:19:16,00:19:18,There is a chance that on the moon
00:19:18,00:19:23,"there are fossil bacteria which got blasted out into space,"
00:19:23,00:19:26,"ended up on the moon, then got plowed under the moon's surface"
00:19:26,00:19:28,or maybe buried by lava or this kind of thing.
00:19:28,00:19:31,So there's a chance there are fossils up there
00:19:31,00:19:34,of bacteria from the very early days of life on earth.
00:19:34,00:19:36,"- Yeah, I mean, pretty unlikely."
00:19:36,00:19:36,- Pretty unlikely.
00:19:36,00:19:38,(laughing)
00:19:38,00:19:39,- That's quite a cool image
00:19:39,00:19:42,'cause obviously the earth is hurdling through space
00:19:42,00:19:44,and it's quite cool to know that we're leaving
00:19:44,00:19:48,like what an asteroid has that sort of tail out of the back.
00:19:48,00:19:52,So it stretches all the way around the sun
00:19:52,00:19:54,in the path that we go in.
00:19:54,00:19:54,- Yeah.
00:19:54,00:19:57,"- Yeah, scientists call it a large dusty ring."
00:19:57,00:19:57,- Hmm.
00:19:57,00:19:59,(laughing)
00:19:59,00:20:00,- Good day.
00:20:00,00:20:01,"- Yes, they do."
00:20:01,00:20:03,- I don't know why James is cracking up in the morning.
00:20:03,00:20:04,- I'm not laughing at all.
00:20:04,00:20:06,They could do with getting a bigger pump around.
00:20:06,00:20:09,(laughing)
00:20:09,00:20:12,"- Yeah, the other thing about this tail that we're shedding"
00:20:12,00:20:16,"is our magnetic field and it's called a magneto tail,"
00:20:16,00:20:19,"is that when it does sweep through the moon,"
00:20:19,00:20:21,"it's full of these really, really hot, charged,"
00:20:21,00:20:24,"highly charged particles, which it sheds all over the moon."
00:20:24,00:20:27,"And that means that on the surface of the moon,"
00:20:27,00:20:30,suddenly voltages can climb up to hundreds and hundreds of volts.
00:20:30,00:20:32,"So the surface of the moon, it's incredibly electric"
00:20:32,00:20:34,'cause we've just shed all these eyes out.
00:20:34,00:20:35,- Wow.
00:20:35,00:20:36,"- It's cool, isn't it?"
00:20:36,00:20:39,"- So Turecan, and if I stood on the moon,"
00:20:39,00:20:41,then my hair would all go kind of wild
00:20:41,00:20:43,like had been static electricity fired.
00:20:43,00:20:44,"- God, maybe."
00:20:44,00:20:46,"- That'd be pretty cool, isn't it?"
00:20:46,00:20:47,"- You'd have to take your helmet off though,"
00:20:47,00:20:48,"so you would die, but I think it would be worth it"
00:20:48,00:20:49,to find out.
00:20:49,00:20:51,(laughing)
00:20:51,00:20:53,- Could you take your helmet off on the moon
00:20:53,00:20:55,and then put it back on really quickly?
00:20:55,00:20:56,- Yeah. - If you held your breath.
00:20:56,00:20:59,"- Well, and repressurise your suit and all of that."
00:20:59,00:21:00,"- Yeah, kidding, really?"
00:21:00,00:21:02,"- As in, you can survive in outer space"
00:21:02,00:21:05,for like 20 to 30 seconds without dying.
00:21:05,00:21:06,- But it's not worth the risk
00:21:06,00:21:07,"'cause imagine if you took it off,"
00:21:07,00:21:09,your hair went so static that you couldn't fit
00:21:09,00:21:12,the helmet off. (laughing)
00:21:12,00:21:14,"- Do you know when the astronauts,"
00:21:14,00:21:16,the fellows landed on the moon?
00:21:16,00:21:16,What are they called?
00:21:16,00:21:18,"- Armstrong and Aldrin, when they landed on the moon,"
00:21:18,00:21:21,do you know what the official schedule said?
00:21:21,00:21:22,They should do next.
00:21:22,00:21:23,- What?
00:21:23,00:21:24,"- When they landed on the moon,"
00:21:24,00:21:26,the official schedule was for them to have a nap.
00:21:26,00:21:28,"- Yeah, well that's the whole reason"
00:21:28,00:21:30,that a lot of problems were caused
00:21:30,00:21:32,with the actual footage of the moon landing
00:21:32,00:21:33,because they were asleep.
00:21:33,00:21:35,"- No, 'cause they were not asleep."
00:21:35,00:21:38,"They had scheduled a nap and Armstrong was so awake,"
00:21:38,00:21:40,"he said I'm not having a nap, we're gonna go out now."
00:21:40,00:21:42,The problem was is that the wrong side
00:21:42,00:21:45,of the earth was facing the moon when he wanted to go out.
00:21:45,00:21:48,So they had to re-root where they were gonna take
00:21:48,00:21:52,the signal from to bring back the signal of the moon.
00:21:52,00:21:54,"So Park's observatory in Australia,"
00:21:54,00:21:55,suddenly were the key people
00:21:55,00:21:57,because they had access to the moon.
00:21:57,00:21:59,America was on the other side of the...
00:21:59,00:22:00,- Wow.
00:22:00,00:22:02,- All because Neil Armstrong didn't wanna have a nap.
00:22:02,00:22:03,- He refused to have a nap.
00:22:03,00:22:05,So he messed up everything that was meant to happen
00:22:05,00:22:07,in terms of the televised footage.
00:22:07,00:22:10,Do you know what the words of the third man on the moon were?
00:22:10,00:22:11,- You'll do this.
00:22:11,00:22:13,"- I do, but say it, yeah."
00:22:13,00:22:15,- That's how I should answer everything.
00:22:15,00:22:18,(all laughing)
00:22:18,00:22:21,"So this is Pete Conrad, who went up in the Apollo 12 mission"
00:22:21,00:22:22,a few years later.
00:22:22,00:22:24,So he was the third person to walk on the moon
00:22:24,00:22:26,and he had a bet with a journalist
00:22:26,00:22:30,who'd bet that NASA dictated what the first words
00:22:30,00:22:31,of anyone who stepped on the moon had to be
00:22:31,00:22:34,and he was saying no they don't and I'll prove it.
00:22:34,00:22:36,So the journalist told him he had to say a particular thing
00:22:36,00:22:39,"and what he said was when he stepped,"
00:22:39,00:22:41,"when he took his first step, whoopie."
00:22:41,00:22:43,So the thing about this guy was he was a really short guy
00:22:43,00:22:45,"and he stepped out and he said whoopie, man,"
00:22:45,00:22:47,"that may have been a small one for Neil,"
00:22:47,00:22:48,but that's a long one for me.
00:22:48,00:22:51,And that was his first words as he stepped out of the spacecraft
00:22:51,00:22:54,"and then actually as he stepped onto the moon itself,"
00:22:54,00:22:58,"he said, ooh, is that soft and queasy?"
00:22:58,00:22:59,- Wow.
00:22:59,00:23:03,- Does anyone know the shortest trip ever to the moon?
00:23:03,00:23:05,"- Well, let's engrom it, it didn't take very long at all."
00:23:05,00:23:05,Is it that one?
00:23:05,00:23:08,"There's a 45 minute special, including the preamble."
00:23:08,00:23:09,(laughing)
00:23:09,00:23:11,"- It must be that the moon landed on,"
00:23:11,00:23:13,a bit of the moon landed on Earth and so on.
00:23:13,00:23:16,"- No, no, just as in, I'm genuinely asking the question,"
00:23:16,00:23:18,of all the times that humans have gone
00:23:18,00:23:20,"from the Earth to around the moon,"
00:23:20,00:23:22,what's the shortest amount of time it's taken?
00:23:22,00:23:23,- Do you mean the full trip?
00:23:23,00:23:25,- All the time. - From here to there.
00:23:25,00:23:27,- Oh. - From here to there.
00:23:27,00:23:30,- I would think it would take a couple of days
00:23:30,00:23:31,to get there.
00:23:31,00:23:32,- So. - That's a long way actually.
00:23:32,00:23:34,"It's 250,000 miles can we take."
00:23:34,00:23:37,- I would say nine hours.
00:23:37,00:23:38,"- Oh, that's so close."
00:23:38,00:23:39,- Is it?
00:23:39,00:23:40,"- Yeah, eight and a half hours."
00:23:40,00:23:42,"- That's amazing. - Well, 2006,"
00:23:42,00:23:44,it was a new horizons probe.
00:23:44,00:23:45,"So it didn't land on the moon,"
00:23:45,00:23:48,but it went from the Earth to where the moon is.
00:23:48,00:23:50,- Eight hours. - In eight and a half hours.
00:23:50,00:23:51,- That's crazy.
00:23:51,00:23:56,"- And that was in 2006, and the longest ever was in 2003,"
00:23:56,00:23:59,"and that was one year, one month, and two weeks."
00:23:59,00:24:01,It took them to get from here to the moon.
00:24:01,00:24:03,"- Well, they kept asking for directions on the way."
00:24:03,00:24:04,People kept on messing around with them.
00:24:04,00:24:06,(laughing)
00:24:06,00:24:08,"It's very rocky terrain, it's nice."
00:24:08,00:24:10,(laughing)
00:24:10,00:24:12,"- No, that was a deliberate attempt to do it"
00:24:12,00:24:15,with as little kind of fuel as possible.
00:24:15,00:24:17,- It's little publicity or interest.
00:24:17,00:24:20,- How are knowing to pull the short straw
00:24:20,00:24:22,and bid on the year long one?
00:24:22,00:24:23,"Although it's been a people one on these, what are they?"
00:24:23,00:24:25,- On neither one or any people.
00:24:25,00:24:26,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:24:26,00:24:27,"- When you think that a few hundred years ago,"
00:24:27,00:24:29,"it would take six months to get to Australia,"
00:24:29,00:24:31,and now we can go to the moon in eight hours.
00:24:31,00:24:32,- Yeah.
00:24:32,00:24:34,"- It's a substantial change, it's all the same."
00:24:34,00:24:35,(laughing)
00:24:35,00:24:37,"- Up until researching this particular fact,"
00:24:37,00:24:40,"I would have said, if I was asked the question,"
00:24:40,00:24:42,does the earth get heavier or lighter every year?
00:24:42,00:24:43,I would have said heavier.
00:24:43,00:24:45,"- You would have said, yeah, I know that,"
00:24:45,00:24:46,but what are you saying?
00:24:46,00:24:48,(laughing)
00:24:48,00:24:49,"- Yeah, I would have said heavier"
00:24:49,00:24:50,because I would have thought
00:24:50,00:24:52,"with the amount of space dust and asteroids passing by,"
00:24:52,00:24:54,we always hear about stuff coming into our atmosphere
00:24:54,00:24:57,"that we would get heavier, but in fact, we do get lighter,"
00:24:57,00:24:59,and it's because of all the escaping gas.
00:24:59,00:25:03,- So we expel in terms of stuff out of the atmosphere
00:25:03,00:25:05,"and out of earth into space every year,"
00:25:05,00:25:09,"the equivalent weight of 890,000 humans."
00:25:09,00:25:10,- Wow.
00:25:10,00:25:11,- That's how much goes out.
00:25:11,00:25:15,"So that's 50,000 tons that it gets lighter per year,"
00:25:15,00:25:18,"and we only take on 40,000 from things"
00:25:18,00:25:20,entering the atmosphere from space.
00:25:20,00:25:21,- Wow.
00:25:21,00:25:23,- And helium just goes out into space.
00:25:23,00:25:24,I had no idea.
00:25:24,00:25:25,"- Yeah, it is."
00:25:25,00:25:27,"- When you get a helium balloon and you let go of it,"
00:25:27,00:25:28,that's where it goes.
00:25:28,00:25:29,"- No, well thank God for balloons."
00:25:29,00:25:31,- The moon is listed with helium balloons.
00:25:31,00:25:34,- I never appreciated what a great invention balloons were.
00:25:34,00:25:35,"- Right, here's the thing."
00:25:35,00:25:37,If you do let a balloon go.
00:25:37,00:25:38,- Yeah.
00:25:38,00:25:39,- Words it go.
00:25:39,00:25:41,- It goes up all the leaks out of it
00:25:41,00:25:42,"to make its way into space,"
00:25:42,00:25:45,and then the balloon falls down again.
00:25:45,00:25:48,- Just pops and a bit of plastic goes somewhere.
00:25:48,00:25:49,- Yeah.
00:25:49,00:25:51,"- And that plastic often ends up in the sea,"
00:25:51,00:25:53,especially in coastal results or anything like that.
00:25:53,00:25:55,"So a lot of places in America,"
00:25:55,00:25:58,"especially on the east coast, have banned helium balloons."
00:25:58,00:26:00,People letting helium balloons go
00:26:00,00:26:02,because it just causes so much crap in the sea.
00:26:02,00:26:03,- Oh really?
00:26:03,00:26:04,- It's very sensible.
00:26:04,00:26:05,"- Yeah, it's good."
00:26:05,00:26:06,"- Yeah, it makes sense."
00:26:06,00:26:07,Or you should make all balloons out of fish food.
00:26:07,00:26:08,- Yeah.
00:26:08,00:26:09,- Are you in a gradeable balloon?
00:26:09,00:26:10,- Oh yeah.
00:26:10,00:26:10,- Yeah.
00:26:10,00:26:12,- That must be invented.
00:26:12,00:26:14,- You can make a puff of fish into a balloon.
00:26:14,00:26:15,- You could.
00:26:15,00:26:16,- They do that.
00:26:16,00:26:17,- They do that.
00:26:17,00:26:18,- And then you slow it up with an air hose
00:26:18,00:26:21,like anotelerious Mount Rushmore prank.
00:26:21,00:26:23,You let the balloon go and then it's bleeding
00:26:23,00:26:26,"and passing all the gases, stuff, which is so funny."
00:26:26,00:26:29,And then it falls into sea and another fish can eat it.
00:26:29,00:26:30,- They do that in check.
00:26:30,00:26:31,Not the whole story.
00:26:31,00:26:35,"They don't chew the club, but they don't love a fish"
00:26:35,00:26:36,into a balloon.
00:26:36,00:26:38,(upbeat music)
00:26:38,00:26:45,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show"
00:26:45,00:26:48,and that is Chuzinski.
00:26:48,00:26:51,- My fact this week is that the most deadly user
00:26:51,00:26:56,of Portuguese Man of War Venom is not the Portuguese Man of War.
00:26:56,00:26:59,So the most deadly user of the Portuguese Man of War's Venom
00:26:59,00:27:03,"is something that's called a blue dragon sea slug,"
00:27:03,00:27:04,which is the most beautiful creature.
00:27:04,00:27:08,"If you look it up, it's a kind of nudibranque"
00:27:08,00:27:10,which are these little slug-like sea creatures.
00:27:10,00:27:12,It's really lovely looking.
00:27:12,00:27:14,And what it does is it goes and eats the Venom
00:27:14,00:27:15,on the Portuguese Man of War
00:27:15,00:27:18,"and then it has these special limbs,"
00:27:18,00:27:21,these special organs that are especially for storing Venom
00:27:21,00:27:23,and it pushes it out into these little organs.
00:27:23,00:27:26,These finger-like branches
00:27:26,00:27:29,and it is more concentrated at the end of those branches
00:27:29,00:27:30,than it is in the Portuguese Man of War.
00:27:30,00:27:33,"And so when it administers the Venom to someone,"
00:27:33,00:27:35,it's actually more effective than when the Portuguese Man of War
00:27:35,00:27:38,does it in Nixit and it makes it better.
00:27:38,00:27:40,- But it doesn't kill the Portuguese Man of War.
00:27:40,00:27:43,It just uses it like a gas station.
00:27:43,00:27:45,Like it goes up and it just fills up on its Venom.
00:27:45,00:27:46,So it sucks it out.
00:27:46,00:27:47,- And it hurts it as well.
00:27:47,00:27:48,- Yeah.
00:27:48,00:27:51,- It's like being hurt at a gas station.
00:27:51,00:27:54,(laughing)
00:27:54,00:27:56,And that happens to me quite a lot of petrol stations
00:27:56,00:27:58,'cause I always try to haggle.
00:27:58,00:28:01,"So is it the, so it's the nudibranque who gets hurt?"
00:28:01,00:28:02,- The nudibranque gets hurt.
00:28:02,00:28:04,It does have special adaptations
00:28:04,00:28:06,to stop it being too badly injured by the poison
00:28:06,00:28:07,'cause it's really poisonous.
00:28:07,00:28:09,"So it has sort of special mucus,"
00:28:09,00:28:11,which helps to shield it a bit.
00:28:11,00:28:13,"And then, yeah, and then it adapts the stuff."
00:28:13,00:28:14,"- Can I ask about nudibranque, really?"
00:28:14,00:28:17,"- So you would think if you saw a drawing, in the first time,"
00:28:17,00:28:19,"I think most people did see it,"
00:28:19,00:28:22,was a drawing and it was from Captain Cook's Voyages.
00:28:22,00:28:24,It was the artist who did an illustration of it.
00:28:24,00:28:25,You would think it's fake.
00:28:25,00:28:29,You would think that this was a made up secreture.
00:28:29,00:28:33,And it's phenomenal 'cause it swims upside down.
00:28:33,00:28:33,- Yeah.
00:28:33,00:28:35,- And that's a kind of camouflage tactic.
00:28:35,00:28:38,- And it floats upside down at the surface.
00:28:38,00:28:39,Who's to say what's upside down then?
00:28:39,00:28:41,"If that's how it lives, it's whole life."
00:28:41,00:28:42,- Yes.
00:28:42,00:28:43,- That's a good point.
00:28:43,00:28:45,So you're saying maybe all other animals are wrong?
00:28:45,00:28:49,"- No, what I'm saying is if all humans walked around"
00:28:49,00:28:51,"with their head near the floor and their feet in the air,"
00:28:51,00:28:53,then we would think that was the right way up.
00:28:53,00:28:54,- Exactly.
00:28:54,00:28:55,- Yeah.
00:28:55,00:28:56,"- It's like saying to a bat, you sleep upside down."
00:28:56,00:28:57,- But they do.
00:28:57,00:28:58,"- 'Cause I always sleep, I sleep."
00:28:58,00:28:59,"- Yeah, this is the right way up."
00:28:59,00:29:00,- This is the right way up.
00:29:00,00:29:01,"- Well, why are we launching this war"
00:29:01,00:29:04,on correct placement of things?
00:29:04,00:29:05,- You started it.
00:29:05,00:29:06,- Why did it not say it?
00:29:06,00:29:08,- I just don't see that you can say
00:29:08,00:29:10,that he's swimming upside down.
00:29:10,00:29:12,"If he spends his whole life upside down,"
00:29:12,00:29:13,maybe that's the correct way for him to live.
00:29:13,00:29:15,- Does he spend his whole life upside down?
00:29:15,00:29:17,- I don't think so.
00:29:17,00:29:20,"- Okay, so the way he floats is he inflates his stomach."
00:29:20,00:29:22,So I think maybe it's all about what's the back
00:29:22,00:29:23,and what's the stomach.
00:29:23,00:29:25,And the way that this guy floats
00:29:25,00:29:27,is by filling his stomach with gas.
00:29:27,00:29:30,And then he bobbles up to the top of the surface of the ocean.
00:29:30,00:29:33,And then he has his stomach keeping him afloat.
00:29:33,00:29:35,- Prime candidate for this new animal balloon
00:29:35,00:29:36,we've been talking about.
00:29:36,00:29:38,(laughing)
00:29:38,00:29:39,"- Well, here's another thing about Needy Banks."
00:29:39,00:29:42,So they all have their anus above their head.
00:29:42,00:29:43,- Yeah.
00:29:43,00:29:44,- Which James is gonna say is perfectly normal
00:29:44,00:29:46,and why don't we all do it?
00:29:46,00:29:49,"- No, what I'm saying is, maybe if you look at him"
00:29:49,00:29:52,"the other way up, which is how he wants to be looked,"
00:29:52,00:29:54,that his head is in a perfectly normal position.
00:29:54,00:29:56,"- No, because they twist around as they grow."
00:29:56,00:29:58,- So they start off with their anus
00:29:58,00:29:59,"not near their head and then as they grow,"
00:29:59,00:30:01,I think we talked about this with...
00:30:01,00:30:02,- Snails.
00:30:02,00:30:02,- Snails recently.
00:30:02,00:30:04,"So same thing, you see slugs."
00:30:04,00:30:07,Their body twists 180 degrees as they grow.
00:30:07,00:30:08,So they're gills on their anus
00:30:08,00:30:10,that are right by the...
00:30:10,00:30:12,- Who's to say that when they're a baby nudie brink
00:30:12,00:30:14,that they're not upside down then
00:30:14,00:30:16,and they flip to be the right way around?
00:30:16,00:30:18,- You would be like us being born in a hand stamp
00:30:18,00:30:19,"as you shouldn't, and us realizing"
00:30:19,00:30:22,this didn't feel so right.
00:30:22,00:30:23,"- I'm just like, I can't wait for my anus"
00:30:23,00:30:24,to be nearer of my head.
00:30:24,00:30:25,Is that what they're all saying?
00:30:25,00:30:27,(laughing)
00:30:27,00:30:28,Can't wait for all the girls to fancy people
00:30:28,00:30:31,"when they see how close to my head, my anus is."
00:30:31,00:30:33,(laughing)
00:30:33,00:30:34,- That would...
00:30:34,00:30:35,"Their parents must say to them,"
00:30:35,00:30:36,"""These really are the best days of your life."""
00:30:36,00:30:38,(laughing)
00:30:38,00:30:40,"- You know, enjoy these days of distance"
00:30:40,00:30:42,between your head and your anus when you get.
00:30:42,00:30:44,(laughing)
00:30:44,00:30:48,- There are nudier ranks which have disposable penises.
00:30:48,00:30:49,- Okay.
00:30:49,00:30:50,- So they're an afterlife.
00:30:50,00:30:51,So they both have a penis on their right-hand side.
00:30:51,00:30:53,So they stand next to each other.
00:30:53,00:30:54,- How do you know it's a right-hand side?
00:30:54,00:30:55,- They're not like that.
00:30:55,00:30:58,(laughing)
00:30:58,00:30:59,- So they stand next to each other
00:30:59,00:31:01,facing in opposite directions.
00:31:01,00:31:02,- Yeah.
00:31:02,00:31:03,- And then they sort of lock their penises
00:31:03,00:31:03,into each other.
00:31:03,00:31:04,- Yeah.
00:31:04,00:31:05,- And they transfer sperm both ways.
00:31:05,00:31:07,But then their penises break off
00:31:07,00:31:09,and fall to the ocean surface.
00:31:09,00:31:10,- Do you think that's a really terrifying moment
00:31:10,00:31:11,the first time it happens?
00:31:11,00:31:13,(laughing)
00:31:13,00:31:15,- I imagine it only happens once.
00:31:15,00:31:16,"- No, does it?"
00:31:16,00:31:19,"- So they drop off, fall to the bottom of the sea."
00:31:19,00:31:21,"And then within 24 hours sometimes,"
00:31:21,00:31:23,they've regenerated a new one.
00:31:23,00:31:26,'Cause most of that penis is a big coil inside them
00:31:26,00:31:27,and it just grows out again.
00:31:27,00:31:28,- Oh cool.
00:31:28,00:31:30,- They would have noticed that
00:31:30,00:31:33,"when they were a younger nudie branch alone in their shell,"
00:31:33,00:31:36,having a little touch of themselves.
00:31:36,00:31:39,- I think a vigorous session might result in it.
00:31:39,00:31:41,"- But again, the first time it happens,"
00:31:41,00:31:42,it would be terrifying.
00:31:42,00:31:44,- That's true.
00:31:44,00:31:47,- You couldn't come back home after a night out
00:31:47,00:31:49,if you'd been sleeping around.
00:31:49,00:31:51,You couldn't come back home to your wife
00:31:51,00:31:53,"and say, ""Oh, nothing happened."""
00:31:53,00:31:55,"She's like, ""Well, why'd you cut, followed up then?"""
00:31:55,00:31:58,(laughing)
00:31:58,00:32:02,- So another nudie branch is solar-powered one.
00:32:02,00:32:04,"If you guys spread about this one, it's so cool."
00:32:04,00:32:06,So it harvests.
00:32:06,00:32:07,It basically farms algae.
00:32:07,00:32:12,It eats algae and then it uses the photosynthesis
00:32:12,00:32:13,of the algae.
00:32:13,00:32:16,So the algae inside it photosynthesizes using the sun.
00:32:16,00:32:20,And then this is what this nudie branch gets its energy from.
00:32:20,00:32:21,And it has these little solar panels.
00:32:21,00:32:23,"So if you look at it, you can see these little brown spots"
00:32:23,00:32:25,"on it, which are the specific zones"
00:32:25,00:32:26,where it's put its algae
00:32:26,00:32:28,so that it can get the light from the sun
00:32:28,00:32:29,so that it can photosynthesize.
00:32:29,00:32:31,- Aren't we all solar powered?
00:32:31,00:32:33,- But we're not using photosynthesis.
00:32:33,00:32:37,"And so they get the chloroplasts from the seaweed,"
00:32:37,00:32:38,like the little green bits.
00:32:38,00:32:41,And that turns the sunlight into energy.
00:32:41,00:32:42,"- Okay, well, that's pretty much it."
00:32:42,00:32:45,"- So they can live for a year on sunlight alone, on solar."
00:32:45,00:32:46,- Wow.
00:32:46,00:32:48,- And you're right that all of our energy
00:32:48,00:32:49,eventually comes from the sun.
00:32:49,00:32:52,"- Yeah, so like as humans, we're solar powered."
00:32:52,00:32:53,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:32:53,00:32:54,- That was pretty much.
00:32:54,00:32:55,"- Never thought of being solar powered before,"
00:32:55,00:32:57,but I am.
00:32:57,00:32:57,- Well done.
00:32:57,00:32:58,(laughing)
00:32:58,00:32:59,- You are.
00:32:59,00:33:01,- It's worth knowing that about yourself.
00:33:01,00:33:02,- Yeah.
00:33:02,00:33:06,"- So I grew up in Australia in my, after I took the money"
00:33:06,00:33:10,"and run from Hong Kong, and along the beaches,"
00:33:10,00:33:12,you get blue bottles and blue bottles
00:33:12,00:33:13,in reading up about Portuguese Manor War
00:33:13,00:33:15,are the same kind of thing.
00:33:15,00:33:16,It's the same kind of animal.
00:33:16,00:33:17,And I thought that was an animal.
00:33:17,00:33:19,I thought it was a jellyfish.
00:33:19,00:33:21,So I've just discovered today that Portuguese Manor War
00:33:21,00:33:25,is basically a team effort of a bunch of different creatures
00:33:25,00:33:26,working as one.
00:33:26,00:33:27,- Yeah.
00:33:27,00:33:28,- Like when the power range is combined
00:33:28,00:33:30,"to be that giant robot thing,"
00:33:30,00:33:32,it's like that's what a Portuguese Manor War is.
00:33:32,00:33:34,"- Yeah, that's a really good analogy actually."
00:33:34,00:33:36,- So I'm really confused about this.
00:33:36,00:33:39,"I read somewhere that they were different species,"
00:33:39,00:33:40,but they're not different species.
00:33:40,00:33:43,They're different kinds of animal
00:33:43,00:33:46,"in the same species, all working together,"
00:33:46,00:33:48,all having different things that they specialize in.
00:33:48,00:33:51,"- So someone will be responsible for the sex, fun job,"
00:33:51,00:33:53,"someone's responsible for the digestion,"
00:33:53,00:33:54,also quite a fun job.
00:33:54,00:33:56,And then there's probably someone responsible
00:33:56,00:33:58,"for sort of pooing and stuff, which is probably less fun."
00:33:58,00:34:01,"But yeah, it's like, they're called Siphonophores."
00:34:01,00:34:02,Siphonophores.
00:34:02,00:34:04,"And yeah, it's a bunch of tiny organisms"
00:34:04,00:34:05,which all perform-
00:34:05,00:34:07,"- Dinosaur, yeah."
00:34:07,00:34:10,"- They do, I'd never thought about their name before"
00:34:10,00:34:11,and why they're called that.
00:34:11,00:34:13,And they're called that because they look like a Portuguese Manor
00:34:13,00:34:15,like a sailing boat.
00:34:15,00:34:16,And they really do.
00:34:16,00:34:18,And they've got this kind of sail
00:34:18,00:34:19,that sticks up out of the water.
00:34:19,00:34:22,"And it performs the purpose of a sail,"
00:34:22,00:34:23,which I didn't know.
00:34:23,00:34:25,"So the way they get around is by, you know,"
00:34:25,00:34:27,"actively, you have to mate in sailing around"
00:34:27,00:34:29,by sticking their sail up in the water.
00:34:29,00:34:30,- Underwater.
00:34:30,00:34:31,"- No, no, above the water."
00:34:31,00:34:31,- Above the water.
00:34:31,00:34:34,- They have a surface sail that takes them to places.
00:34:34,00:34:36,"- The sail sticks up above the water, it catches the wind."
00:34:36,00:34:39,"And then another good candidate for the balloon,"
00:34:39,00:34:40,they can deflate their sail
00:34:40,00:34:42,if they see a threat coming along like a turtle.
00:34:42,00:34:43,It's gonna make them.
00:34:43,00:34:45,And then they re-inflate it when it's gone.
00:34:45,00:34:46,- That's amazing.
00:34:46,00:34:48,- So you know how some animals are unbelievably poisonous
00:34:48,00:34:49,to humans.
00:34:49,00:34:52,Like there are frogs that can kill a thousand people
00:34:52,00:34:53,with a single thing.
00:34:53,00:34:56,"Yeah, I was reading an article about why this is the case."
00:34:56,00:34:59,Why is it useful for a frog to be able to kill a thousand people
00:34:59,00:35:00,with a single thing?
00:35:00,00:35:01,"And the really interesting thing is,"
00:35:01,00:35:03,"it's not useful at all, right?"
00:35:03,00:35:05,It just happens that we're measuring
00:35:05,00:35:07,how many humans something could kill.
00:35:07,00:35:09,Or a snake can kill a quarter of a million mice.
00:35:09,00:35:11,It would be pointless for the snake.
00:35:11,00:35:14,"But the thing is, animals always adapt their poison"
00:35:14,00:35:15,"to what they're hunting, right?"
00:35:15,00:35:17,"So there are loads of, for example,"
00:35:17,00:35:21,hedgehogs that could survive a bite from a snake
00:35:21,00:35:24,"which would kill a person much, much bigger."
00:35:24,00:35:26,But hedgehogs and snakes are in an arms race
00:35:26,00:35:27,of who's going to develop more poison
00:35:27,00:35:30,"or better poison resistance, right?"
00:35:30,00:35:33,"So if you find a snake which is unbelievably poisonous,"
00:35:33,00:35:36,you can bet there's probably a little rodent out there
00:35:36,00:35:38,which is unbelievably tough
00:35:38,00:35:41,and could take a huge amount of poison before dying.
00:35:41,00:35:43,"- So I wonder with those little kind of tiny,"
00:35:43,00:35:46,little colourful frogs that live in the Amazon.
00:35:46,00:35:47,- Yeah.
00:35:47,00:35:49,- What you're saying is there's some animal there
00:35:49,00:35:52,that is super hardcore that you just can't poison.
00:35:52,00:35:54,"- Yeah, we don't know what it feels on them"
00:35:54,00:35:56,that is nearly resistant to their poison maybe
00:35:56,00:35:59,and so they're having to constantly become more poisonous.
00:35:59,00:36:01,- You know that the Brazilian wandering spider
00:36:01,00:36:03,can give you when it bites you an erection.
00:36:03,00:36:07,So intense that you become impotent.
00:36:07,00:36:09,"- That is tough, isn't it?"
00:36:09,00:36:12,"- Well, James found what I think is the best headlight"
00:36:12,00:36:13,of the year so far.
00:36:13,00:36:15,"I know we're just into early February,"
00:36:15,00:36:17,"but it was that, what was it?"
00:36:17,00:36:18,"- James, it was--"
