00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,920
 (electronic music)

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:17,040
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,760
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,680
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,840
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,200
 I am sitting here with James Harkin,

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,440
 Anichezinski and Drew Murray.

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,480
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones.

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,960
 - Can't do it, can't do it.

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,320
 - I think it's Drew Hunter Murray.

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,160
 - It's Drew Hunter Murray.

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,320
 - It's not that, it's not that.

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,800
 I've acetate, we acetate last week.

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,160
 It's lightning.

15
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,440
 I wanna stick with that.

16
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,680
 Please never Drew.

17
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,520
 - Oh.

18
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,200
 - I love Drew's photograph.

19
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,720
 - And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

20
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,440
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,320
 and in a particular order, here we go.

22
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,880
 Starting with my facts, my fact this week is that

23
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,280
 in the final years of its construction,

24
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,600
 Mount Rushmore was built by baseball players.

25
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,440
 - Nice.

26
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,880
 - Did they run out of dynamite?

27
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,040
 And they said, "Well, we better just get a bunch of guys

28
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,040
 with bad stuff."

29
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,360
 (laughing)

30
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,280
 No, so Mount Rushmore was constructed

31
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,680
 between 1927 and 1941 in the first early stages

32
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,080
 and actually right up until about 1938.

33
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,960
 It was being led by a guy called Gutson Borglum

34
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,680
 and Gutson Borglum had a sun working on it called Lincoln

35
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,440
 and Lincoln was obsessed with baseball

36
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,440
 and he really wanted to put a baseball team together.

37
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,080
 So from 1938, when he started hiring all the people

38
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,680
 to work on it, one of the things that he required you

39
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,680
 to be able to do was play baseball

40
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,880
 so that you could be part of the team.

41
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,920
 It almost didn't matter if you were able to be

42
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,760
 (laughing)

43
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,600
 - Is it true?

44
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,720
 Well, one of the guys, his name's Nick Clifford,

45
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,480
 he's the last construction worker on Mount Rushmore

46
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,440
 who's still alive and you can meet him in the summers.

47
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,920
 So if you're this year, 2017 in the summer,

48
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,400
 he's 95 years old at the moment.

49
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,200
 Go to Mount Rushmore and he sits there

50
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,920
 and he gives tours, he explains what's going on,

51
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,520
 how they built it, he signs books

52
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,160
 and he hands out baseball cards from the team

53
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,000
 and they actually competed in amateur baseball

54
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,320
 and they made it to the semi-finals, they came in third.

55
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,160
 So they were really good and...

56
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,520
 - The semi-finals of...

57
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,000
 - Of the amateur baseball, no one's heard of League.

58
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,680
 (laughing)

59
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,480
 - Just in the Mount Rushmore area.

60
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,960
 - Yeah, no, I'm not fully sure on that actually.

61
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,800
 - Actually, it did sound when you read people's memoirs

62
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,720
 about it, it sounds like they had a really good team work

63
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,240
 kind of bond, doesn't it, the workers.

64
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,480
 So they all had these weird nicknames

65
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,720
 so they were all called stuff like

66
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:40,120
 lively and polluca and red and hoot and whiskey.

67
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,960
 - And howdy.

68
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,400
 - And howdy, yeah.

69
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,440
 - And one guy's called Howdy.

70
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,240
 - Did you read the story about what Howdy did

71
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,720
 to one of his teammates at one point?

72
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,560
 - No.

73
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,520
 - So they played quite a lot of pranks on each other, I think.

74
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,160
 So one of their favourite pranks was

75
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,760
 if a new builder came on site,

76
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,240
 then when he was going up on an out-sale,

77
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,760
 then you'd like loosen it so he'd drop down a few feet

78
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,280
 and think he was plummeting to his death.

79
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,520
 - That's bullying, isn't it?

80
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,920
 - Yeah, but bullying is always funny for the bullies,

81
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,000
 and so I think most of them enjoyed it.

82
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,840
 - Okay.

83
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,160
 - It was very good nature.

84
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,160
 - Who will speak for bullies?

85
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,520
 - Hannah will speak for bullies.

86
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,360
 (laughing)

87
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,920
 - Hey, I mean, good company these days.

88
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,000
 But no, he did this thing where I think one of his

89
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,920
 co-workers slapped him on the ass or something.

90
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,640
 So to get him back,

91
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,720
 they have an air hose that they used to remove all this

92
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,560
 rock dust that was all over them at the end of the day.

93
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,600
 They got covered in rock dust.

94
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,240
 So it had really powerful blowing force.

95
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,280
 And he got this air hose and he shoved it up.

96
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,280
 His teammates us and it inflated his teammates in sides.

97
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,040
 And everyone thought he was going to die.

98
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,200
 So this guy said he blew up tighter than a drum.

99
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,160
 And one of the witnesses said that when the hose connected,

100
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,240
 you could see his belly swell right up.

101
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,080
 He yelled, "My God, how do you've killed me?"

102
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,440
 And then he had to start passing air

103
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,760
 and he passed quite a lot of blood with it.

104
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,360
 - If you're listening and you have access to high pressure

105
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,600
 air hoses, do not try this at home.

106
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,240
 - No fatalities of any of the workers on Mount Rushmore,

107
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,920
 despite all the weird pranks that they would play on each other.

108
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,760
 - Yeah.

109
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,520
 - So when did you say it was finished, don't?

110
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,480
 - 1941 is when they ran out of funding.

111
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,120
 - Exactly, it's not finished.

112
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,960
 - Yeah.

113
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,960
 - Someone could still take up the metal.

114
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,960
 They're meant to be down to the waist.

115
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,480
 But once they've done the faces and the shoulders

116
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,720
 and things, they sort of thought,

117
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,000
 well, you know who they are.

118
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,200
 It's good that they didn't start at the other end.

119
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,680
 - You'd start on the waist.

120
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,160
 (all laughing)

121
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,960
 - Did you read that thing where it's not going to be

122
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,360
 properly finished for 300,000 years?

123
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,240
 That's because the granite erodes.

124
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,360
 And it erodes by a very, very tiny bit.

125
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,240
 And the person who was making it knew this.

126
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,800
 And so he deliberately made all the faces slightly fatter.

127
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,120
 So they'll just keep eroding and keep eroding.

128
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,280
 And then apparently in 300,000 years,

129
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,000
 all the proportions will be correct.

130
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,840
 - That's amazing.

131
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,680
 - That's incredible.

132
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,720
 - But why did he plan it to be right in 300,000 years

133
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,480
 rather than just, nah.

134
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,320
 - To go with the 300,000th anniversary

135
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,000
 of the Declaration of Independence.

136
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,080
 (all laughing)

137
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,160
 - Well, the thing is that the faces will still be,

138
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,200
 you'll still have the outline of a face

139
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,320
 for seven million years before they erode.

140
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,160
 - Wow.

141
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,480
 - And I read, this is in futility closet,

142
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,840
 a website I read this.

143
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,880
 The noses are about 240 inches long.

144
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,760
 It will be 2.4 million years

145
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,160
 before it's down to just a flat face.

146
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,920
 If they erode all the way, they'll look like four Voldemort's.

147
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,480
 That'd be quite cool.

148
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,400
 - Yes.

149
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,920
 So in 2.4 million years,

150
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,360
 they'll think that four of the first presidents of America

151
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,880
 were all Voldemort before, rather than just

152
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,880
 the most recent ones.

153
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,000
 (all laughing)

154
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,800
 - They finished the heads at different times, right?

155
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,640
 'Cause they would,

156
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,360
 they worked on Washington and then they finished Washington,

157
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,640
 then they started on the next one.

158
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,480
 So they had different dedication ceremonies

159
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,240
 for each one before they did the whole dedication at the end.

160
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,200
 And before each dedication,

161
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,120
 they would put a massive American flag

162
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,320
 over the president's head,

163
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,960
 and then they'd drop it to reveal.

164
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,880
 - Wow.

165
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,040
 - Here it is.

166
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,680
 - So does that mean people didn't really know

167
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,440
 who it was gonna be before they?

168
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,440
 - I think I had a hunch.

169
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,280
 - Maybe.

170
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,440
 - You know, 90% of it was done with dynamite, Mount Rushmore.

171
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,600
 - Yeah, I think that's amazing.

172
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,120
 - Yeah, and they got to within four inches

173
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,160
 of the final thing, just using dynamite,

174
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,240
 and then they had to do the check.

175
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,960
 - But the rest was done by hand, wasn't it?

176
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,800
 - Yeah.

177
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,160
 - Like as in, they would make little holes

178
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,040
 and then they just grab it out with their hands.

179
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,800
 - It's like, called honeycoming.

180
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,320
 - We do loads and loads and loads of little holes,

181
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,400
 and then just pull it out.

182
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,040
 - I think it's incredible that you would do

183
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,200
 almost all of it with massive dynamite,

184
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,920
 and the last bit, you would just kind of grab it out

185
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,760
 with your hands.

186
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,320
 - Yeah, that's really cool.

187
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,960
 - On the actual baseball card that you can buy

188
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,800
 of Nick,

189
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,760
 - Contracted to the baseball last well.

190
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,200
 He's actually holding one of the honeycomb devices

191
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,040
 on the front.

192
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,400
 As an old man, he's holding it.

193
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,280
 So they've still got the original ones there.

194
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,120
 - That's really cool.

195
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,960
 - Yeah.

196
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,040
 - I do get the feeling you're more interested

197
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,800
 in the baseball side of this than the monuments side of them.

198
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,640
 - Well, I just thought, yeah, I think it's pretty,

199
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,000
 I mean, they clearly are as well.

200
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,520
 If you go to the local cafe

201
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,080
 on all of their trays is the story of the baseball team.

202
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,880
 - They don't even point out the mountain to you.

203
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,280
 - There is some barris that that's the focus point.

204
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,080
 - Do they have, have they recovered it with those flags?

205
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,240
 - Originally, it was not gonna be any president

206
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,080
 on Mount Rushmore.

207
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,520
 It was just gonna be a mountain.

208
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,360
 - No.

209
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,960
 - That's how God intended it.

210
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,720
 - So the original plan,

211
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,760
 before they got a burglum on board

212
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,080
 was to have sort of figures from the American West.

213
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,040
 So maybe Chief Red Cloud Buffalo Bill

214
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,720
 and Lewis and Clark, the two explorers,

215
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,760
 who explored a load around there,

216
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,400
 and then cuts on to cover.

217
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,120
 And he said, "There's absolutely no way

218
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,440
 I'm spending my life's work on these non-entities.

219
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,320
 It's gonna be presidents or nothing."

220
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,600
 And he insisted and they did change the plan.

221
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,800
 - Yeah, I have a baseball facts for you, Dan.

222
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,000
 - Oh, great.

223
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,680
 So during the war, during the Cold War,

224
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,680
 America wanted to make a surveillance tunnel in Berlin.

225
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,040
 They needed to get something on the floor

226
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,040
 on the other side that they could use as a marker,

227
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,840
 which is where the tunnel would go to.

228
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,160
 And so what they would do is they'd play baseball

229
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,640
 right near the wall and deliberately hit the ball over.

230
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,400
 So the ball landed there and then they'd be able to survey it

231
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,840
 and be able to see where the ball is and use that as a marker.

232
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,680
 - Wow.

233
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,880
 - So it's like, can we not have a ball back, please?

234
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,320
 - Yeah, exactly that.

235
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,600
 And what happened was the Germans were just too kind

236
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,720
 and they just kept going and collecting the ball back.

237
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,480
 - I couldn't do that sort of, so they could never do it.

238
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,120
 - Oh, that's awesome, that's so good.

239
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,120
 - Like a dog, like an annoying dog in World War II.

240
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,680
 And also on baseball, the Americans designed a grenade

241
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,920
 that was exactly the same shape and size

242
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,920
 and weight as a baseball.

243
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,480
 So the Americans could throw it easily.

244
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,320
 Think, didn't they?

245
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,800
 It was called the bino, really?

246
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,000
 - Yeah, and that was to make it because it was,

247
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,560
 and it was supposed to be thrown like a baseball

248
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,800
 and then it exploded on impact.

249
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,720
 - Was it painted as well to look like a baseball

250
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,280
 and had stitching on it like a baseball?

251
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,120
 - Yeah.

252
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,720
 - Was there an amusing mix up at any point with these things?

253
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,880
 - Yeah.

254
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,640
 - Yeah, maybe it's like Christmas and they get in the trenches

255
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,160
 and they're like, okay, let's play football.

256
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,480
 No, no, let's play baseball.

257
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,800
 I brought my own ball.

258
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:02,160
 - According to a medical report published in 1977

259
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,560
 and the diseases of colon and rectum,

260
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,960
 a 49-year-old man was admitted to San Francisco hospital

261
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,680
 complaining of severe pain.

262
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,600
 A firm, fixed round object was found to be lodged

263
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,080
 high in his rectum.

264
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,600
 The man then admitted that he and his sexual partner

265
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,560
 had celebrated the Oakland Day's World Series win

266
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,160
 by having a baseball inserted into his anus.

267
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,640
 (laughing)

268
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,880
 - Oh my God.

269
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,280
 - Could have been worse.

270
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,320
 - Could have been a bat.

271
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,640
 (laughing)

272
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,240
 (upbeat music)

273
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,480
 - Okay, this time for fact number two

274
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,960
 and that is James.

275
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,040
 - Okay, my fact this week is that on some train journeys

276
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,200
 in China passengers are forced to take it in turns

277
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,720
 to use the seats so that everyone gets a chance

278
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,000
 to sit down for some of the journey.

279
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,120
 (groaning)

280
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,960
 That's good, isn't it?

281
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,800
 - Yeah.

282
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,280
 - It has the southern rail of countries China.

283
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,280
 (laughing)

284
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,800
 - So this is the Spring Festival, Chinese New Year,

285
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,640
 which is happening at the moment

286
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,480
 and it's the biggest migration of humans in the world.

287
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,760
 There's like three billion people making journeys

288
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:15,000
 around China and while China infrastructure is pretty good

289
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,400
 and it's getting better, it's still that's way too many people

290
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,120
 to be moving around and there's only so many trains

291
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,320
 you can have and they sell these tickets

292
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,160
 and a lot of the journeys are quite long

293
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,640
 and so they make a rule where everyone gets to sit down

294
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,480
 for a little bit.

295
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,760
 But I think that's quite a good rule actually.

296
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,600
 - Yeah, that's great.

297
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,600
 - Yeah, yeah.

298
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,080
 - How many journeys did you second made?

299
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,520
 - I've said three billion.

300
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,160
 - Yeah, there's three billion journeys, isn't it?

301
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,040
 Not three billion people.

302
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,040
 - That's amazing.

303
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,600
 - You have to go there and you have to come back

304
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,960
 and then you might have to change a bit.

305
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,960
 - Yeah, exactly.

306
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,080
 I wonder if a change counts still as one journey though

307
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,840
 'cause it does when you play a ticket, isn't it?

308
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,040
 - Did you see that thing in the news?

309
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,080
 I think it was today or yesterday where

310
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,200
 say you're buying a ticket from London to Bolton.

311
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,480
 Then you would have to pay a certain amount of money

312
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,640
 but you go on this website and you say where you want to go

313
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,720
 and it splits it all up so you might go

314
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,760
 London to Watford, Watford to Milton Keynes,

315
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,000
 Milton Keyes to Birmingham, Birmingham to Stoke Stoke to Bolton

316
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,200
 and it works out the cost of all those

317
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,800
 and you can save a load of money.

318
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,240
 A lot of football fans from the FA Cup were using it

319
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,880
 and they all saved a ton of money.

320
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,720
 - Oh yeah, I saw that.

321
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,560
 - You went on the news this morning.

322
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,400
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

323
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,240
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

324
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,360
 - A guy had 52 tickets from one return journey

325
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,200
 to a football match.

326
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,600
 - 'Cause you need a ticket for each one

327
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,120
 of these tiny little things

328
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,320
 and so he just has a massive envelope full of tons

329
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,400
 of tickets and whether ticker inspector comes,

330
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,160
 you're like, okay, it's definitely one of these.

331
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,000
 - That's amazing.

332
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,840
 - Apparently that is true.

333
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,880
 Although I think they're gonna try and make

334
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,360
 all their tickets a bit easier

335
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,560
 than that news article I read.

336
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,560
 They're gonna change a lot of the tickets, aren't they?

337
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,920
 There's something like three million different possible

338
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,200
 tickets you can buy in the UK

339
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,600
 and the majority of them have never been bought by anyone.

340
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,440
 - No way.

341
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,920
 - There's something like that, yeah.

342
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,160
 Anyway, this isn't about trains.

343
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,600
 This is about the Chinese movements of people.

344
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,440
 - Oh yeah.

345
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,960
 - So one thing about Chinese New Year

346
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,480
 is that it's very confusing that it's called Spring.

347
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,840
 It's called the Spring Festival

348
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,720
 because it's obviously in winter.

349
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,640
 - It's supposed to be like the start of spring, isn't it?

350
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,000
 - Yeah, but it doesn't feel right.

351
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,120
 - It's so optimistic.

352
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,760
 So I think China divides the year into,

353
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,760
 is it 20 sections which have different names

354
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,320
 and then there's one section which is the first section

355
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,440
 of the year which is start of spring

356
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,040
 and that runs for a couple of weeks in mid February.

357
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,040
 And so this is called Spring Festival

358
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,880
 'cause I think it's the festival that comes

359
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,720
 just on the cusp of start of spring period.

360
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,560
 - Right.

361
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,560
 - Which is just, I mean, it's not spring.

362
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,840
 It's sweet that they're convincing themselves that it is.

363
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,920
 - And it's called Chinese New Year.

364
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,920
 It doesn't even have a new year.

365
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,200
 It doesn't even have in first January.

366
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,360
 - It's going on.

367
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,200
 - Don't you grow up there.

368
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,240
 What's this all about?

369
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,800
 - What's the deal with Chinese New Year?

370
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,320
 - Did you do the thing where you give each other

371
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,320
 envelopes with money?

372
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,800
 - Yeah, Lycee, it's called.

373
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,440
 Or I'd probably pronounce that slightly wrong

374
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,880
 but you used to say Gongsi Fatalai, Sitala,

375
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,840
 and they would give you a red packet with money inside

376
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,840
 and it was living in Hong Kong

377
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,160
 which was a very affluent place.

378
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,400
 It was amazing 'cause everyone gave you these packets

379
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,680
 and it was the time to make money if you were a kid.

380
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,400
 You would just walk around and walk up to adults

381
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,080
 and say Gongsi Fatalai and they'd just give you a red packet.

382
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,800
 And it was, yeah, yeah.

383
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,600
 So if you went to a party, it was incredible.

384
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,160
 It was like the tooth fairy went nuts

385
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,840
 and everyone revealed themselves to be that person

386
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,280
 and they're just handing you money.

387
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,120
 - Is it just a kid?

388
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,040
 'Cause I thought it was everyone

389
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,160
 and then I thought at the end of the day

390
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,360
 you'd end up equal.

391
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,600
 - I left and I was a kid.

392
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,440
 So yeah.

393
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,640
 - You left a new, you stayed.

394
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,840
 Got all the money.

395
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,800
 While still a child fled the scene of the crime.

396
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,640
 - Very crafty.

397
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,240
 Just on the, everyone traveling everywhere

398
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,800
 for Chinese New Year, there has been a story

399
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,160
 in the news last week about one guy

400
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,600
 who started cycling home

401
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,480
 'cause he was very poor, couldn't afford a train ticket,

402
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,720
 couldn't afford a plane.

403
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,720
 So he started cycling really early

404
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,360
 and he cycled for 30 days, he went 300 miles.

405
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,920
 So 10 miles a day, it was not great.

406
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,800
 But, okay, maybe it's a bad bike.

407
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,640
 Anyway, he then found out.

408
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,480
 - Rocky Turin.

409
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,320
 - Yeah, it was gonna be a Rocky Turin.

410
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,640
 Exactly, anyway, he then found out

411
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,960
 he'd be going the wrong direction for 300 miles.

412
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,800
 (laughing)

413
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,640
 - No.

414
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,560
 - Yeah, well, I don't know

415
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,280
 because he was trying to travel 1000 miles supposedly

416
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,800
 and it meant that he would have had to take three months

417
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,960
 to get home.

418
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:05,040
 So, I can't quite believe it.

419
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,680
 But apparently he'd been living in internet cafes

420
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,760
 'cause he was really broke.

421
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,000
 - Yeah, but maybe he thought

422
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,320
 that it was gonna get more than 10 miles a day, probably.

423
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,320
 - Probably, yeah.

424
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,760
 - Didn't bank on that Rocky Turin and the bad bike.

425
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,960
 (laughing)

426
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,120
 - Anyway, this was reported in the China People's Daily,

427
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,680
 an organization I have no reason to mistrust.

428
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,120
 - I remember reading that as well.

429
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,640
 And the idea was that he kept asking people

430
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,400
 which way to go and they all started telling

431
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,840
 in the wrong direction.

432
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,760
 (laughing)

433
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,280
 - If you kept asking them, presumably,

434
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,440
 he'd just have gone back and forth over the same 10 miles

435
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,440
 to get it again and again.

436
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,440
 (laughing)

437
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,800
 - Just, can I just say something about crowded trains?

438
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,960
 This is kind of about 'cause I didn't know this was a thing,

439
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:47,440
 but in Japan, in Tokyo, they have pushers at stations

440
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,320
 which are people to, I think they're called Oshia

441
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,080
 and they're people to push people onto crowded trains.

442
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,000
 And someone described it as perfectly happily.

443
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,720
 Someone who's been pushed by a person said,

444
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,360
 "It's like if you had a big laundry basket

445
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,360
 "and it's overflowing, you just full stuff in there."

446
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,280
 - You can see footage of this on YouTube,

447
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,160
 if you look it up and it's extraordinary.

448
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,600
 It's a, there's no more space like literally to even breathe

449
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,040
 and you've got people shoving like crazy

450
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,200
 to get those doors closed.

451
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,200
 It's astonishing.

452
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,880
 - And they pull people off as well, don't they?

453
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,840
 - That's a bit much.

454
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,240
 (laughing)

455
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,080
 - Yeah.

456
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,680
 - How much do you have to give them in a red envelope to do that?

457
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,240
 (laughing)

458
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,000
 - No, they're called polar offers sometimes.

459
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,080
 - No, they're not.

460
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,120
 - I've seen them called polar offers.

461
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,680
 - Mm, I'm sure.

462
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,520
 - Wow.

463
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,840
 - We used to have, in Hong Kong,

464
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,120
 you used to be able to, in some cases, get your own carriage

465
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,840
 if you were Western because of the number four.

466
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,560
 So the superstition and number four is so great

467
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,840
 that a lot of people wouldn't get anything

468
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,000
 that had the number four on it.

469
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,320
 - 'Cause it sounds like the word for death is that it?

470
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,800
 - Which is death and yeah, it's the number four.

471
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,960
 So if, say, a cable car that had number four on it

472
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,720
 would be empty and so if you were,

473
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,160
 if they could see a Western family,

474
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,680
 they would go, come on out, and skip the two.

475
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,880
 - Please, please, get into the death carriage.

476
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,960
 (laughing)

477
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,000
 - Yeah.

478
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,560
 - In 2005, this is the period when everyone's going

479
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,280
 is known as Chunyun, I think.

480
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,120
 - Yeah.

481
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,240
 - So in the 2005 Chunyun period, the train offices

482
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,320
 had certainly less than 100 phone lines,

483
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,760
 more than 10, but less than 100.

484
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,520
 So somewhere in the tens of phone lines

485
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:25,080
 and they were getting 19.91 million calls per hour.

486
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,320
 (laughing)

487
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,080
 - You are number 10 million and 12 in the queue.

488
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:37,360
 - Just one last thing, it's the Chinese year of the Cockrole

489
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,120
 that's just started.

490
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,560
 That's 2017.

491
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,080
 Obviously it's every, what is it, every 12?

492
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,520
 - 12 years until you return to your animal.

493
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:50,600
 - So one of them was 1945 and 1945 was the first time

494
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,960
 that the cartoon character Foghorn Leghorn was ever voiced.

495
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,520
 So here's a year of the Cockrole character.

496
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,680
 - Oh, that's good.

497
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,400
 - And also, have you heard of Mike the headless chicken?

498
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,240
 - Yeah.

499
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,080
 - Must have done.

500
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,640
 He was the guy who there was a family in America

501
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,280
 and they were chopping the heads off chickens

502
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,040
 and one of them stayed alive and ran around

503
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:13,400
 for a couple of years and he was born also in 1945.

504
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,000
 So he was also a year of the Cockrole guy.

505
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,160
 - Oh, very nice.

506
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,040
 - You know that all very arrogant though,

507
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,040
 the year of the Cockrole types, the roosters

508
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,320
 and this year of the roosters, the year of the vein,

509
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,320
 the arrogant and the emotionally volatile.

510
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,680
 - What are you?

511
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,600
 - I am a tiger.

512
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,440
 - What's your Chinese New Year side?

513
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,920
 (laughing)

514
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,760
 - It's interesting.

515
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,960
 So what the description you just made

516
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,240
 is taken very seriously back in China

517
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,360
 and there were certain years where pregnancy rates

518
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,680
 are extremely low because it's a very bad year

519
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,560
 and I wish I could remember of the top of my head.

520
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,080
 - And the year of the loser.

521
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:49,920
 - But you have.

522
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,680
 (laughing)

523
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,260
 (upbeat music)

524
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:59,600
 - Okay, it's time for fact number three

525
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,440
 and that is Drew.

526
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,400
 (laughing)

527
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,400
 - Oh, this is the worst new name I've ever had.

528
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,560
 I went to an old boy school for 11 years.

529
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,760
 (laughing)

530
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,640
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three

531
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,880
 and that is Lightning.

532
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,760
 (laughing)

533
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,600
 - My fact is that the moon has been collecting

534
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,440
 tiny bits of earth for the last three billion years.

535
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,520
 (laughing)

536
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,360
 - Collecting.

537
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,200
 - Collecting.

538
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,040
 - Like a baseball card.

539
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,360
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

540
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,520
 - Exactly what we're gonna do with them.

541
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,560
 - It's going to, it's got an album

542
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,920
 and it does swapsies with Venus.

543
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,200
 (laughing)

544
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,320
 - Yeah, this is really, really cool.

545
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,120
 So there's a new discovery which has been published

546
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,760
 in nature which is that the moon is dusted

547
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,960
 in this fine layer of oxygen

548
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,520
 and it was a bit of a puzzle as to how it had got there.

549
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,720
 And it turns out that earth basically has a tail

550
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,680
 of ions and atoms and electrons and things like this

551
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,080
 which lashes out into space behind it.

552
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:56,920
 - Wow.

553
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,760
 - And normally the moon doesn't get any of it

554
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,480
 but sometimes when the sun, the earth and the moon

555
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,080
 are all lined up together, the moon is shielded

556
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,120
 from the solar wind, right?

557
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,080
 And then it gets a bit of a lashing of oxygen atoms.

558
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,680
 So the really cool thing is that we don't have much evidence

559
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,280
 of very, very early life on earth

560
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,240
 like the first bacteria.

561
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,520
 There is a chance that on the moon

562
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:23,560
 there are fossil bacteria which got blasted out into space,

563
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,560
 ended up on the moon, then got plowed under the moon's surface

564
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,640
 or maybe buried by lava or this kind of thing.

565
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,160
 So there's a chance there are fossils up there

566
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,280
 of bacteria from the very early days of life on earth.

567
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,080
 - Yeah, I mean, pretty unlikely.

568
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:36,920
 - Pretty unlikely.

569
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,080
 (laughing)

570
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,160
 - That's quite a cool image

571
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,080
 'cause obviously the earth is hurdling through space

572
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,600
 and it's quite cool to know that we're leaving

573
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,520
 like what an asteroid has that sort of tail out of the back.

574
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,560
 So it stretches all the way around the sun

575
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,000
 in the path that we go in.

576
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,840
 - Yeah.

577
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,080
 - Yeah, scientists call it a large dusty ring.

578
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:57,920
 - Hmm.

579
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,200
 (laughing)

580
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,040
 - Good day.

581
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,040
 - Yes, they do.

582
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,040
 - I don't know why James is cracking up in the morning.

583
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,160
 - I'm not laughing at all.

584
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,640
 They could do with getting a bigger pump around.

585
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,240
 (laughing)

586
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,680
 - Yeah, the other thing about this tail that we're shedding

587
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,880
 is our magnetic field and it's called a magneto tail,

588
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,240
 is that when it does sweep through the moon,

589
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,800
 it's full of these really, really hot, charged,

590
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,560
 highly charged particles, which it sheds all over the moon.

591
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,520
 And that means that on the surface of the moon,

592
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,320
 suddenly voltages can climb up to hundreds and hundreds of volts.

593
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,960
 So the surface of the moon, it's incredibly electric

594
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,920
 'cause we've just shed all these eyes out.

595
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,760
 - Wow.

596
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,600
 - It's cool, isn't it?

597
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,360
 - So Turecan, and if I stood on the moon,

598
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,320
 then my hair would all go kind of wild

599
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,880
 like had been static electricity fired.

600
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,880
 - God, maybe.

601
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,080
 - That'd be pretty cool, isn't it?

602
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,120
 - You'd have to take your helmet off though,

603
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,960
 so you would die, but I think it would be worth it

604
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,800
 to find out.

605
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,160
 (laughing)

606
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,640
 - Could you take your helmet off on the moon

607
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,080
 and then put it back on really quickly?

608
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,120
 - Yeah. - If you held your breath.

609
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,560
 - Well, and repressurise your suit and all of that.

610
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,400
 - Yeah, kidding, really?

611
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,560
 - As in, you can survive in outer space

612
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,920
 for like 20 to 30 seconds without dying.

613
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,840
 - But it's not worth the risk

614
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,680
 'cause imagine if you took it off,

615
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,440
 your hair went so static that you couldn't fit

616
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,760
 the helmet off. (laughing)

617
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,720
 - Do you know when the astronauts,

618
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,040
 the fellows landed on the moon?

619
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:16,880
 What are they called?

620
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,800
 - Armstrong and Aldrin, when they landed on the moon,

621
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,000
 do you know what the official schedule said?

622
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,520
 They should do next.

623
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,360
 - What?

624
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,200
 - When they landed on the moon,

625
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,160
 the official schedule was for them to have a nap.

626
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,400
 - Yeah, well that's the whole reason

627
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,560
 that a lot of problems were caused

628
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,320
 with the actual footage of the moon landing

629
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,920
 because they were asleep.

630
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,560
 - No, 'cause they were not asleep.

631
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,640
 They had scheduled a nap and Armstrong was so awake,

632
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,960
 he said I'm not having a nap, we're gonna go out now.

633
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,880
 The problem was is that the wrong side

634
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,600
 of the earth was facing the moon when he wanted to go out.

635
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,960
 So they had to re-root where they were gonna take

636
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,080
 the signal from to bring back the signal of the moon.

637
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,400
 So Park's observatory in Australia,

638
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,760
 suddenly were the key people

639
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,600
 because they had access to the moon.

640
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,200
 America was on the other side of the...

641
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,360
 - Wow.

642
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,320
 - All because Neil Armstrong didn't wanna have a nap.

643
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,160
 - He refused to have a nap.

644
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,120
 So he messed up everything that was meant to happen

645
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,760
 in terms of the televised footage.

646
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,720
 Do you know what the words of the third man on the moon were?

647
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,560
 - You'll do this.

648
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,200
 - I do, but say it, yeah.

649
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,240
 - That's how I should answer everything.

650
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,240
 (all laughing)

651
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,840
 So this is Pete Conrad, who went up in the Apollo 12 mission

652
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,920
 a few years later.

653
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,640
 So he was the third person to walk on the moon

654
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,760
 and he had a bet with a journalist

655
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,080
 who'd bet that NASA dictated what the first words

656
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,560
 of anyone who stepped on the moon had to be

657
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,120
 and he was saying no they don't and I'll prove it.

658
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,680
 So the journalist told him he had to say a particular thing

659
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,200
 and what he said was when he stepped,

660
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,400
 when he took his first step, whoopie.

661
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,680
 So the thing about this guy was he was a really short guy

662
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,640
 and he stepped out and he said whoopie, man,

663
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,080
 that may have been a small one for Neil,

664
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,880
 but that's a long one for me.

665
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,480
 And that was his first words as he stepped out of the spacecraft

666
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,640
 and then actually as he stepped onto the moon itself,

667
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,080
 he said, ooh, is that soft and queasy?

668
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,600
 - Wow.

669
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,280
 - Does anyone know the shortest trip ever to the moon?

670
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,120
 - Well, let's engrom it, it didn't take very long at all.

671
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:05,960
 Is it that one?

672
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,320
 There's a 45 minute special, including the preamble.

673
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,880
 (laughing)

674
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,320
 - It must be that the moon landed on,

675
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,240
 a bit of the moon landed on Earth and so on.

676
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,200
 - No, no, just as in, I'm genuinely asking the question,

677
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,400
 of all the times that humans have gone

678
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,400
 from the Earth to around the moon,

679
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,240
 what's the shortest amount of time it's taken?

680
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,800
 - Do you mean the full trip?

681
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,000
 - All the time. - From here to there.

682
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,080
 - Oh. - From here to there.

683
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,280
 - I would think it would take a couple of days

684
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,120
 to get there.

685
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,280
 - So. - That's a long way actually.

686
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,240
 It's 250,000 miles can we take.

687
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,400
 - I would say nine hours.

688
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,560
 - Oh, that's so close.

689
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,400
 - Is it?

690
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,760
 - Yeah, eight and a half hours.

691
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,480
 - That's amazing. - Well, 2006,

692
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,600
 it was a new horizons probe.

693
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,680
 So it didn't land on the moon,

694
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,080
 but it went from the Earth to where the moon is.

695
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,200
 - Eight hours. - In eight and a half hours.

696
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,040
 - That's crazy.

697
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:56,280
 - And that was in 2006, and the longest ever was in 2003,

698
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,320
 and that was one year, one month, and two weeks.

699
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,080
 It took them to get from here to the moon.

700
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,280
 - Well, they kept asking for directions on the way.

701
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,960
 People kept on messing around with them.

702
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,760
 (laughing)

703
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,280
 It's very rocky terrain, it's nice.

704
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,480
 (laughing)

705
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,840
 - No, that was a deliberate attempt to do it

706
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,480
 with as little kind of fuel as possible.

707
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,320
 - It's little publicity or interest.

708
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,400
 - How are knowing to pull the short straw

709
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,080
 and bid on the year long one?

710
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,640
 Although it's been a people one on these, what are they?

711
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,520
 - On neither one or any people.

712
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,360
 - Yeah, yeah.

713
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,200
 - When you think that a few hundred years ago,

714
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,280
 it would take six months to get to Australia,

715
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,760
 and now we can go to the moon in eight hours.

716
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,760
 - Yeah.

717
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,560
 - It's a substantial change, it's all the same.

718
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,560
 (laughing)

719
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,960
 - Up until researching this particular fact,

720
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,480
 I would have said, if I was asked the question,

721
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,920
 does the earth get heavier or lighter every year?

722
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,880
 I would have said heavier.

723
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,400
 - You would have said, yeah, I know that,

724
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,400
 but what are you saying?

725
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,760
 (laughing)

726
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,640
 - Yeah, I would have said heavier

727
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,440
 because I would have thought

728
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,680
 with the amount of space dust and asteroids passing by,

729
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,680
 we always hear about stuff coming into our atmosphere

730
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,520
 that we would get heavier, but in fact, we do get lighter,

731
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,440
 and it's because of all the escaping gas.

732
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,640
 - So we expel in terms of stuff out of the atmosphere

733
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,960
 and out of earth into space every year,

734
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,400
 the equivalent weight of 890,000 humans.

735
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,240
 - Wow.

736
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,080
 - That's how much goes out.

737
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:15,040
 So that's 50,000 tons that it gets lighter per year,

738
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,040
 and we only take on 40,000 from things

739
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,480
 entering the atmosphere from space.

740
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,320
 - Wow.

741
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,280
 - And helium just goes out into space.

742
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,200
 I had no idea.

743
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,040
 - Yeah, it is.

744
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,480
 - When you get a helium balloon and you let go of it,

745
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,320
 that's where it goes.

746
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,960
 - No, well thank God for balloons.

747
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,640
 - The moon is listed with helium balloons.

748
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,400
 - I never appreciated what a great invention balloons were.

749
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,480
 - Right, here's the thing.

750
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,320
 If you do let a balloon go.

751
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,160
 - Yeah.

752
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,200
 - Words it go.

753
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,800
 - It goes up all the leaks out of it

754
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,880
 to make its way into space,

755
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,920
 and then the balloon falls down again.

756
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,600
 - Just pops and a bit of plastic goes somewhere.

757
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,440
 - Yeah.

758
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,040
 - And that plastic often ends up in the sea,

759
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,920
 especially in coastal results or anything like that.

760
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,880
 So a lot of places in America,

761
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,880
 especially on the east coast, have banned helium balloons.

762
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,400
 People letting helium balloons go

763
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,720
 because it just causes so much crap in the sea.

764
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,560
 - Oh really?

765
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,400
 - It's very sensible.

766
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,240
 - Yeah, it's good.

767
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,080
 - Yeah, it makes sense.

768
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,600
 Or you should make all balloons out of fish food.

769
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,440
 - Yeah.

770
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,280
 - Are you in a gradeable balloon?

771
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,120
 - Oh yeah.

772
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:10,960
 - Yeah.

773
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,200
 - That must be invented.

774
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,680
 - You can make a puff of fish into a balloon.

775
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,520
 - You could.

776
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,360
 - They do that.

777
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,200
 - They do that.

778
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,560
 - And then you slow it up with an air hose

779
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,920
 like anotelerious Mount Rushmore prank.

780
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,800
 You let the balloon go and then it's bleeding

781
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,960
 and passing all the gases, stuff, which is so funny.

782
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,840
 And then it falls into sea and another fish can eat it.

783
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,960
 - They do that in check.

784
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,960
 Not the whole story.

785
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,160
 They don't chew the club, but they don't love a fish

786
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,200
 into a balloon.

787
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,780
 (upbeat music)

788
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:45,520
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show

789
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,640
 and that is Chuzinski.

790
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,480
 - My fact this week is that the most deadly user

791
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:56,480
 of Portuguese Man of War Venom is not the Portuguese Man of War.

792
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,840
 So the most deadly user of the Portuguese Man of War's Venom

793
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,080
 is something that's called a blue dragon sea slug,

794
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,880
 which is the most beautiful creature.

795
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,680
 If you look it up, it's a kind of nudibranque

796
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,800
 which are these little slug-like sea creatures.

797
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,800
 It's really lovely looking.

798
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,560
 And what it does is it goes and eats the Venom

799
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,960
 on the Portuguese Man of War

800
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,720
 and then it has these special limbs,

801
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,560
 these special organs that are especially for storing Venom

802
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,840
 and it pushes it out into these little organs.

803
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,040
 These finger-like branches

804
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,040
 and it is more concentrated at the end of those branches

805
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,560
 than it is in the Portuguese Man of War.

806
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,200
 And so when it administers the Venom to someone,

807
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,880
 it's actually more effective than when the Portuguese Man of War

808
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,000
 does it in Nixit and it makes it better.

809
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,680
 - But it doesn't kill the Portuguese Man of War.

810
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,120
 It just uses it like a gas station.

811
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,400
 Like it goes up and it just fills up on its Venom.

812
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,600
 So it sucks it out.

813
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,800
 - And it hurts it as well.

814
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,640
 - Yeah.

815
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,640
 - It's like being hurt at a gas station.

816
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,160
 (laughing)

817
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,720
 And that happens to me quite a lot of petrol stations

818
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,120
 'cause I always try to haggle.

819
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,800
 So is it the, so it's the nudibranque who gets hurt?

820
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,880
 - The nudibranque gets hurt.

821
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,360
 It does have special adaptations

822
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,480
 to stop it being too badly injured by the poison

823
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,320
 'cause it's really poisonous.

824
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,360
 So it has sort of special mucus,

825
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,040
 which helps to shield it a bit.

826
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,040
 And then, yeah, and then it adapts the stuff.

827
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,880
 - Can I ask about nudibranque, really?

828
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,880
 - So you would think if you saw a drawing, in the first time,

829
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,400
 I think most people did see it,

830
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,160
 was a drawing and it was from Captain Cook's Voyages.

831
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,960
 It was the artist who did an illustration of it.

832
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,920
 You would think it's fake.

833
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:29,560
 You would think that this was a made up secreture.

834
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,040
 And it's phenomenal 'cause it swims upside down.

835
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:33,880
 - Yeah.

836
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,760
 - And that's a kind of camouflage tactic.

837
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,200
 - And it floats upside down at the surface.

838
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,840
 Who's to say what's upside down then?

839
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,520
 If that's how it lives, it's whole life.

840
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,360
 - Yes.

841
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,200
 - That's a good point.

842
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,840
 So you're saying maybe all other animals are wrong?

843
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,160
 - No, what I'm saying is if all humans walked around

844
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,680
 with their head near the floor and their feet in the air,

845
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,320
 then we would think that was the right way up.

846
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,160
 - Exactly.

847
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,000
 - Yeah.

848
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,720
 - It's like saying to a bat, you sleep upside down.

849
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,560
 - But they do.

850
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,560
 - 'Cause I always sleep, I sleep.

851
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,560
 - Yeah, this is the right way up.

852
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,400
 - This is the right way up.

853
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,440
 - Well, why are we launching this war

854
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,160
 on correct placement of things?

855
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,000
 - You started it.

856
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,720
 - Why did it not say it?

857
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,640
 - I just don't see that you can say

858
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,480
 that he's swimming upside down.

859
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,040
 If he spends his whole life upside down,

860
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,720
 maybe that's the correct way for him to live.

861
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,960
 - Does he spend his whole life upside down?

862
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,160
 - I don't think so.

863
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:20,880
 - Okay, so the way he floats is he inflates his stomach.

864
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,680
 So I think maybe it's all about what's the back

865
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,520
 and what's the stomach.

866
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,040
 And the way that this guy floats

867
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,640
 is by filling his stomach with gas.

868
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,760
 And then he bobbles up to the top of the surface of the ocean.

869
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,040
 And then he has his stomach keeping him afloat.

870
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,240
 - Prime candidate for this new animal balloon

871
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,240
 we've been talking about.

872
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,480
 (laughing)

873
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,960
 - Well, here's another thing about Needy Banks.

874
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,320
 So they all have their anus above their head.

875
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,160
 - Yeah.

876
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,640
 - Which James is gonna say is perfectly normal

877
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,000
 and why don't we all do it?

878
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,400
 - No, what I'm saying is, maybe if you look at him

879
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,000
 the other way up, which is how he wants to be looked,

880
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,080
 that his head is in a perfectly normal position.

881
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,920
 - No, because they twist around as they grow.

882
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,200
 - So they start off with their anus

883
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,880
 not near their head and then as they grow,

884
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,200
 I think we talked about this with...

885
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,040
 - Snails.

886
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:02,880
 - Snails recently.

887
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,280
 So same thing, you see slugs.

888
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:07,120
 Their body twists 180 degrees as they grow.

889
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,320
 So they're gills on their anus

890
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,000
 that are right by the...

891
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,920
 - Who's to say that when they're a baby nudie brink

892
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,560
 that they're not upside down then

893
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,240
 and they flip to be the right way around?

894
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,440
 - You would be like us being born in a hand stamp

895
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,960
 as you shouldn't, and us realizing

896
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,000
 this didn't feel so right.

897
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,200
 - I'm just like, I can't wait for my anus

898
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,320
 to be nearer of my head.

899
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,840
 Is that what they're all saying?

900
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,120
 (laughing)

901
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,680
 Can't wait for all the girls to fancy people

902
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,920
 when they see how close to my head, my anus is.

903
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,560
 (laughing)

904
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,400
 - That would...

905
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,240
 Their parents must say to them,

906
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,800
 "These really are the best days of your life."

907
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,120
 (laughing)

908
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,120
 - You know, enjoy these days of distance

909
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,000
 between your head and your anus when you get.

910
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,240
 (laughing)

911
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,320
 - There are nudier ranks which have disposable penises.

912
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,160
 - Okay.

913
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,000
 - So they're an afterlife.

914
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,520
 So they both have a penis on their right-hand side.

915
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,040
 So they stand next to each other.

916
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,560
 - How do you know it's a right-hand side?

917
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,400
 - They're not like that.

918
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,360
 (laughing)

919
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,480
 - So they stand next to each other

920
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,200
 facing in opposite directions.

921
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,040
 - Yeah.

922
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,040
 - And then they sort of lock their penises

923
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:03,880
 into each other.

924
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,720
 - Yeah.

925
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,640
 - And they transfer sperm both ways.

926
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,200
 But then their penises break off

927
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,640
 and fall to the ocean surface.

928
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,920
 - Do you think that's a really terrifying moment

929
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,880
 the first time it happens?

930
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,280
 (laughing)

931
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,480
 - I imagine it only happens once.

932
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,920
 - No, does it?

933
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,680
 - So they drop off, fall to the bottom of the sea.

934
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,960
 And then within 24 hours sometimes,

935
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,760
 they've regenerated a new one.

936
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,120
 'Cause most of that penis is a big coil inside them

937
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,680
 and it just grows out again.

938
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,520
 - Oh cool.

939
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,240
 - They would have noticed that

940
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,640
 when they were a younger nudie branch alone in their shell,

941
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,360
 having a little touch of themselves.

942
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,680
 - I think a vigorous session might result in it.

943
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,760
 - But again, the first time it happens,

944
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,960
 it would be terrifying.

945
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,280
 - That's true.

946
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:47,080
 - You couldn't come back home after a night out

947
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,640
 if you'd been sleeping around.

948
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,400
 You couldn't come back home to your wife

949
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,120
 and say, "Oh, nothing happened."

950
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,400
 She's like, "Well, why'd you cut, followed up then?"

951
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,400
 (laughing)

952
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:02,400
 - So another nudie branch is solar-powered one.

953
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,720
 If you guys spread about this one, it's so cool.

954
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,200
 So it harvests.

955
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,680
 It basically farms algae.

956
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:12,200
 It eats algae and then it uses the photosynthesis

957
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,040
 of the algae.

958
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,320
 So the algae inside it photosynthesizes using the sun.

959
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:20,000
 And then this is what this nudie branch gets its energy from.

960
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,480
 And it has these little solar panels.

961
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,800
 So if you look at it, you can see these little brown spots

962
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,720
 on it, which are the specific zones

963
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,960
 where it's put its algae

964
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,600
 so that it can get the light from the sun

965
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,880
 so that it can photosynthesize.

966
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,760
 - Aren't we all solar powered?

967
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,880
 - But we're not using photosynthesis.

968
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:37,400
 And so they get the chloroplasts from the seaweed,

969
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,960
 like the little green bits.

970
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,280
 And that turns the sunlight into energy.

971
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,280
 - Okay, well, that's pretty much it.

972
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:45,880
 - So they can live for a year on sunlight alone, on solar.

973
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,720
 - Wow.

974
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,480
 - And you're right that all of our energy

975
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,880
 eventually comes from the sun.

976
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,480
 - Yeah, so like as humans, we're solar powered.

977
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,320
 - Yeah, yeah.

978
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,160
 - That was pretty much.

979
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,840
 - Never thought of being solar powered before,

980
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,080
 but I am.

981
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:57,920
 - Well done.

982
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,760
 (laughing)

983
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,600
 - You are.

984
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,520
 - It's worth knowing that about yourself.

985
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,360
 - Yeah.

986
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:06,000
 - So I grew up in Australia in my, after I took the money

987
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,360
 and run from Hong Kong, and along the beaches,

988
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,120
 you get blue bottles and blue bottles

989
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,960
 in reading up about Portuguese Manor War

990
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,560
 are the same kind of thing.

991
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,960
 It's the same kind of animal.

992
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,960
 And I thought that was an animal.

993
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,120
 I thought it was a jellyfish.

994
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,200
 So I've just discovered today that Portuguese Manor War

995
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,720
 is basically a team effort of a bunch of different creatures

996
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,720
 working as one.

997
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,560
 - Yeah.

998
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,840
 - Like when the power range is combined

999
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,680
 to be that giant robot thing,

1000
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,800
 it's like that's what a Portuguese Manor War is.

1001
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,320
 - Yeah, that's a really good analogy actually.

1002
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,480
 - So I'm really confused about this.

1003
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,000
 I read somewhere that they were different species,

1004
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,600
 but they're not different species.

1005
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,800
 They're different kinds of animal

1006
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,160
 in the same species, all working together,

1007
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,800
 all having different things that they specialize in.

1008
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,440
 - So someone will be responsible for the sex, fun job,

1009
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,120
 someone's responsible for the digestion,

1010
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,760
 also quite a fun job.

1011
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,120
 And then there's probably someone responsible

1012
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,880
 for sort of pooing and stuff, which is probably less fun.

1013
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,720
 But yeah, it's like, they're called Siphonophores.

1014
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,720
 Siphonophores.

1015
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,920
 And yeah, it's a bunch of tiny organisms

1016
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,920
 which all perform-

1017
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,360
 - Dinosaur, yeah.

1018
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,200
 - They do, I'd never thought about their name before

1019
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,520
 and why they're called that.

1020
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,760
 And they're called that because they look like a Portuguese Manor

1021
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,240
 like a sailing boat.

1022
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,920
 And they really do.

1023
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,280
 And they've got this kind of sail

1024
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,840
 that sticks up out of the water.

1025
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,160
 And it performs the purpose of a sail,

1026
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,000
 which I didn't know.

1027
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,640
 So the way they get around is by, you know,

1028
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,720
 actively, you have to mate in sailing around

1029
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,120
 by sticking their sail up in the water.

1030
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,120
 - Underwater.

1031
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,120
 - No, no, above the water.

1032
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:31,960
 - Above the water.

1033
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,560
 - They have a surface sail that takes them to places.

1034
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,360
 - The sail sticks up above the water, it catches the wind.

1035
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,200
 And then another good candidate for the balloon,

1036
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,400
 they can deflate their sail

1037
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,760
 if they see a threat coming along like a turtle.

1038
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,760
 It's gonna make them.

1039
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,120
 And then they re-inflate it when it's gone.

1040
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,320
 - That's amazing.

1041
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,800
 - So you know how some animals are unbelievably poisonous

1042
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,640
 to humans.

1043
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,240
 Like there are frogs that can kill a thousand people

1044
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,360
 with a single thing.

1045
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,040
 Yeah, I was reading an article about why this is the case.

1046
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:59,000
 Why is it useful for a frog to be able to kill a thousand people

1047
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,440
 with a single thing?

1048
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,760
 And the really interesting thing is,

1049
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,720
 it's not useful at all, right?

1050
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,440
 It just happens that we're measuring

1051
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,400
 how many humans something could kill.

1052
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,640
 Or a snake can kill a quarter of a million mice.

1053
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,480
 It would be pointless for the snake.

1054
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,200
 But the thing is, animals always adapt their poison

1055
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,800
 to what they're hunting, right?

1056
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,600
 So there are loads of, for example,

1057
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:21,160
 hedgehogs that could survive a bite from a snake

1058
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:24,120
 which would kill a person much, much bigger.

1059
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,480
 But hedgehogs and snakes are in an arms race

1060
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,880
 of who's going to develop more poison

1061
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,320
 or better poison resistance, right?

1062
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,680
 So if you find a snake which is unbelievably poisonous,

1063
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,160
 you can bet there's probably a little rodent out there

1064
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,000
 which is unbelievably tough

1065
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,120
 and could take a huge amount of poison before dying.

1066
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,600
 - So I wonder with those little kind of tiny,

1067
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,040
 little colourful frogs that live in the Amazon.

1068
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,200
 - Yeah.

1069
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,200
 - What you're saying is there's some animal there

1070
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,120
 that is super hardcore that you just can't poison.

1071
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,440
 - Yeah, we don't know what it feels on them

1072
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,800
 that is nearly resistant to their poison maybe

1073
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,320
 and so they're having to constantly become more poisonous.

1074
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,640
 - You know that the Brazilian wandering spider

1075
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,840
 can give you when it bites you an erection.

1076
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:07,160
 So intense that you become impotent.

1077
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,640
 - That is tough, isn't it?

1078
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,520
 - Well, James found what I think is the best headlight

1079
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,360
 of the year so far.

1080
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,840
 I know we're just into early February,

1081
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,960
 but it was that, what was it?

1082
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:18,800
 - James, it was--

1083
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,360
 - Something like Mafia Boss with Permanent erection arrested.

1084
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,960
 - Yeah, finally arrested.

1085
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,800
 Mafia Boss with Permanent erection, finally arrested.

1086
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,960
 And he has a disease that means that he has a Permanent erection

1087
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,240
 and so throughout the whole article,

1088
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,440
 they're talking about his court case

1089
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,320
 and he's sitting in court.

1090
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,400
 It says with bag of ice on his genitals.

1091
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,240
 - He just--

1092
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,080
 - Permanent erection.

1093
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,080
 - He didn't want it to stand up and cut.

1094
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,720
 (laughing)

1095
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,320
 (upbeat music)

1096
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,640
 - Okay, that's it, that's all of our facts.

1097
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,040
