00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920
 (electronic music)

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:17.040
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.760
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.680
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.840
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.200
 I am sitting here with James Harkin,

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.440
 Anichezinski and Drew Murray.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.480
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.960
 - Can't do it, can't do it.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.320
 - I think it's Drew Hunter Murray.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.160
 - It's Drew Hunter Murray.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.320
 - It's not that, it's not that.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.800
 I've acetate, we acetate last week.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.160
 It's lightning.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.440
 I wanna stick with that.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.680
 Please never Drew.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.520
 - Oh.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.200
 - I love Drew's photograph.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.720
 - And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.440
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.320
 and in a particular order, here we go.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.880
 Starting with my facts, my fact this week is that

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.280
 in the final years of its construction,

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.600
 Mount Rushmore was built by baseball players.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.440
 - Nice.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.880
 - Did they run out of dynamite?

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.040
 And they said, "Well, we better just get a bunch of guys

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.040
 with bad stuff."

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.360
 (laughing)

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.280
 No, so Mount Rushmore was constructed

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.680
 between 1927 and 1941 in the first early stages

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.080
 and actually right up until about 1938.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.960
 It was being led by a guy called Gutson Borglum

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.680
 and Gutson Borglum had a sun working on it called Lincoln

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.440
 and Lincoln was obsessed with baseball

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.440
 and he really wanted to put a baseball team together.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.080
 So from 1938, when he started hiring all the people

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.680
 to work on it, one of the things that he required you

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.680
 to be able to do was play baseball

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.880
 so that you could be part of the team.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.920
 It almost didn't matter if you were able to be

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:43.760
 (laughing)

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.600
 - Is it true?

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.720
 Well, one of the guys, his name's Nick Clifford,

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.480
 he's the last construction worker on Mount Rushmore

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.440
 who's still alive and you can meet him in the summers.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.920
 So if you're this year, 2017 in the summer,

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.400
 he's 95 years old at the moment.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.200
 Go to Mount Rushmore and he sits there

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.920
 and he gives tours, he explains what's going on,

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.520
 how they built it, he signs books

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.160
 and he hands out baseball cards from the team

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.000
 and they actually competed in amateur baseball

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.320
 and they made it to the semi-finals, they came in third.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.160
 So they were really good and...

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.520
 - The semi-finals of...

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.000
 - Of the amateur baseball, no one's heard of League.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.680
 (laughing)

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.480
 - Just in the Mount Rushmore area.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.960
 - Yeah, no, I'm not fully sure on that actually.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.800
 - Actually, it did sound when you read people's memoirs

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.720
 about it, it sounds like they had a really good team work

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.240
 kind of bond, doesn't it, the workers.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.480
 So they all had these weird nicknames

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.720
 so they were all called stuff like

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.120
 lively and polluca and red and hoot and whiskey.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.960
 - And howdy.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.400
 - And howdy, yeah.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.440
 - And one guy's called Howdy.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.240
 - Did you read the story about what Howdy did

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.720
 to one of his teammates at one point?

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.560
 - No.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.520
 - So they played quite a lot of pranks on each other, I think.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.160
 So one of their favourite pranks was

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.760
 if a new builder came on site,

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.240
 then when he was going up on an out-sale,

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.760
 then you'd like loosen it so he'd drop down a few feet

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.280
 and think he was plummeting to his death.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.520
 - That's bullying, isn't it?

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.920
 - Yeah, but bullying is always funny for the bullies,

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.000
 and so I think most of them enjoyed it.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.840
 - Okay.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.160
 - It was very good nature.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.160
 - Who will speak for bullies?

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.520
 - Hannah will speak for bullies.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.360
 (laughing)

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.920
 - Hey, I mean, good company these days.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.000
 But no, he did this thing where I think one of his

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.920
 co-workers slapped him on the ass or something.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.640
 So to get him back,

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.720
 they have an air hose that they used to remove all this

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.560
 rock dust that was all over them at the end of the day.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.600
 They got covered in rock dust.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.240
 So it had really powerful blowing force.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.280
 And he got this air hose and he shoved it up.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.280
 His teammates us and it inflated his teammates in sides.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.040
 And everyone thought he was going to die.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.200
 So this guy said he blew up tighter than a drum.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.160
 And one of the witnesses said that when the hose connected,

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.240
 you could see his belly swell right up.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.080
 He yelled, "My God, how do you've killed me?"

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.440
 And then he had to start passing air

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.760
 and he passed quite a lot of blood with it.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.360
 - If you're listening and you have access to high pressure

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.600
 air hoses, do not try this at home.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.240
 - No fatalities of any of the workers on Mount Rushmore,

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.920
 despite all the weird pranks that they would play on each other.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:07.760
 - Yeah.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.520
 - So when did you say it was finished, don't?

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.480
 - 1941 is when they ran out of funding.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.120
 - Exactly, it's not finished.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.960
 - Yeah.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:14.960
 - Someone could still take up the metal.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:15.960
 They're meant to be down to the waist.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.480
 But once they've done the faces and the shoulders

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.720
 and things, they sort of thought,

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.000
 well, you know who they are.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.200
 It's good that they didn't start at the other end.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.680
 - You'd start on the waist.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.160
 (all laughing)

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.960
 - Did you read that thing where it's not going to be

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.360
 properly finished for 300,000 years?

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.240
 That's because the granite erodes.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.360
 And it erodes by a very, very tiny bit.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.240
 And the person who was making it knew this.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.800
 And so he deliberately made all the faces slightly fatter.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.120
 So they'll just keep eroding and keep eroding.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.280
 And then apparently in 300,000 years,

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.000
 all the proportions will be correct.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.840
 - That's amazing.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:51.680
 - That's incredible.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.720
 - But why did he plan it to be right in 300,000 years

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.480
 rather than just, nah.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.320
 - To go with the 300,000th anniversary

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.000
 of the Declaration of Independence.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.080
 (all laughing)

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.160
 - Well, the thing is that the faces will still be,

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.200
 you'll still have the outline of a face

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.320
 for seven million years before they erode.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.160
 - Wow.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.480
 - And I read, this is in futility closet,

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.840
 a website I read this.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.880
 The noses are about 240 inches long.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.760
 It will be 2.4 million years

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.160
 before it's down to just a flat face.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.920
 If they erode all the way, they'll look like four Voldemort's.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.480
 That'd be quite cool.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.400
 - Yes.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.920
 So in 2.4 million years,

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.360
 they'll think that four of the first presidents of America

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.880
 were all Voldemort before, rather than just

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:32.880
 the most recent ones.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.000
 (all laughing)

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.800
 - They finished the heads at different times, right?

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:37.640
 'Cause they would,

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.360
 they worked on Washington and then they finished Washington,

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.640
 then they started on the next one.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.480
 So they had different dedication ceremonies

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.240
 for each one before they did the whole dedication at the end.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.200
 And before each dedication,

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.120
 they would put a massive American flag

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.320
 over the president's head,

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.960
 and then they'd drop it to reveal.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:54.880
 - Wow.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.040
 - Here it is.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.680
 - So does that mean people didn't really know

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.440
 who it was gonna be before they?

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.440
 - I think I had a hunch.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.280
 - Maybe.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.440
 - You know, 90% of it was done with dynamite, Mount Rushmore.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.600
 - Yeah, I think that's amazing.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.120
 - Yeah, and they got to within four inches

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.160
 of the final thing, just using dynamite,

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.240
 and then they had to do the check.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.960
 - But the rest was done by hand, wasn't it?

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:12.800
 - Yeah.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.160
 - Like as in, they would make little holes

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.040
 and then they just grab it out with their hands.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.800
 - It's like, called honeycoming.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.320
 - We do loads and loads and loads of little holes,

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.400
 and then just pull it out.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.040
 - I think it's incredible that you would do

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.200
 almost all of it with massive dynamite,

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.920
 and the last bit, you would just kind of grab it out

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:26.760
 with your hands.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.320
 - Yeah, that's really cool.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.960
 - On the actual baseball card that you can buy

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.800
 of Nick,

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.760
 - Contracted to the baseball last well.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.200
 He's actually holding one of the honeycomb devices

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.040
 on the front.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.400
 As an old man, he's holding it.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.280
 So they've still got the original ones there.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.120
 - That's really cool.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:44.960
 - Yeah.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.040
 - I do get the feeling you're more interested

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.800
 in the baseball side of this than the monuments side of them.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.640
 - Well, I just thought, yeah, I think it's pretty,

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.000
 I mean, they clearly are as well.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.520
 If you go to the local cafe

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.080
 on all of their trays is the story of the baseball team.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.880
 - They don't even point out the mountain to you.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.280
 - There is some barris that that's the focus point.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.080
 - Do they have, have they recovered it with those flags?

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.240
 - Originally, it was not gonna be any president

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.080
 on Mount Rushmore.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.520
 It was just gonna be a mountain.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:09.360
 - No.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.960
 - That's how God intended it.

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.720
 - So the original plan,

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.760
 before they got a burglum on board

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.080
 was to have sort of figures from the American West.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.040
 So maybe Chief Red Cloud Buffalo Bill

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.720
 and Lewis and Clark, the two explorers,

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.760
 who explored a load around there,

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.400
 and then cuts on to cover.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.120
 And he said, "There's absolutely no way

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.440
 I'm spending my life's work on these non-entities.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.320
 It's gonna be presidents or nothing."

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.600
 And he insisted and they did change the plan.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.800
 - Yeah, I have a baseball facts for you, Dan.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.000
 - Oh, great.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.680
 So during the war, during the Cold War,

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:50.680
 America wanted to make a surveillance tunnel in Berlin.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.040
 They needed to get something on the floor

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:55.040
 on the other side that they could use as a marker,

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.840
 which is where the tunnel would go to.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.160
 And so what they would do is they'd play baseball

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.640
 right near the wall and deliberately hit the ball over.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.400
 So the ball landed there and then they'd be able to survey it

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.840
 and be able to see where the ball is and use that as a marker.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:07.680
 - Wow.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.880
 - So it's like, can we not have a ball back, please?

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.320
 - Yeah, exactly that.

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.600
 And what happened was the Germans were just too kind

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.720
 and they just kept going and collecting the ball back.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.480
 - I couldn't do that sort of, so they could never do it.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.120
 - Oh, that's awesome, that's so good.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:26.120
 - Like a dog, like an annoying dog in World War II.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:29.680
 And also on baseball, the Americans designed a grenade

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.920
 that was exactly the same shape and size

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:32.920
 and weight as a baseball.

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:35.480
 So the Americans could throw it easily.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.320
 Think, didn't they?

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.800
 It was called the bino, really?

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:39.000
 - Yeah, and that was to make it because it was,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.560
 and it was supposed to be thrown like a baseball

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:41.800
 and then it exploded on impact.

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.720
 - Was it painted as well to look like a baseball

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.280
 and had stitching on it like a baseball?

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.120
 - Yeah.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.720
 - Was there an amusing mix up at any point with these things?

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:49.880
 - Yeah.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.640
 - Yeah, maybe it's like Christmas and they get in the trenches

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.160
 and they're like, okay, let's play football.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.480
 No, no, let's play baseball.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.800
 I brought my own ball.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:02.160
 - According to a medical report published in 1977

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.560
 and the diseases of colon and rectum,

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.960
 a 49-year-old man was admitted to San Francisco hospital

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.680
 complaining of severe pain.

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:12.600
 A firm, fixed round object was found to be lodged

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.080
 high in his rectum.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.600
 The man then admitted that he and his sexual partner

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.560
 had celebrated the Oakland Day's World Series win

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.160
 by having a baseball inserted into his anus.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.640
 (laughing)

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.880
 - Oh my God.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.280
 - Could have been worse.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.320
 - Could have been a bat.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.640
 (laughing)

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:33.240
 (upbeat music)

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:38.480
 - Okay, this time for fact number two

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.960
 and that is James.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:44.040
 - Okay, my fact this week is that on some train journeys

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:47.200
 in China passengers are forced to take it in turns

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.720
 to use the seats so that everyone gets a chance

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.000
 to sit down for some of the journey.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.120
 (groaning)

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:53.960
 That's good, isn't it?

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:54.800
 - Yeah.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.280
 - It has the southern rail of countries China.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.280
 (laughing)

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:01.800
 - So this is the Spring Festival, Chinese New Year,

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.640
 which is happening at the moment

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:07.480
 and it's the biggest migration of humans in the world.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.760
 There's like three billion people making journeys

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:15.000
 around China and while China infrastructure is pretty good

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.400
 and it's getting better, it's still that's way too many people

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.120
 to be moving around and there's only so many trains

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.320
 you can have and they sell these tickets

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.160
 and a lot of the journeys are quite long

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.640
 and so they make a rule where everyone gets to sit down

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:28.480
 for a little bit.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.760
 But I think that's quite a good rule actually.

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:30.600
 - Yeah, that's great.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.600
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.080
 - How many journeys did you second made?

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.520
 - I've said three billion.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:36.160
 - Yeah, there's three billion journeys, isn't it?

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.040
 Not three billion people.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.040
 - That's amazing.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.600
 - You have to go there and you have to come back

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.960
 and then you might have to change a bit.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:41.960
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.080
 I wonder if a change counts still as one journey though

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.840
 'cause it does when you play a ticket, isn't it?

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.040
 - Did you see that thing in the news?

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.080
 I think it was today or yesterday where

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.200
 say you're buying a ticket from London to Bolton.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.480
 Then you would have to pay a certain amount of money

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.640
 but you go on this website and you say where you want to go

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.720
 and it splits it all up so you might go

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:01.760
 London to Watford, Watford to Milton Keynes,

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:05.000
 Milton Keyes to Birmingham, Birmingham to Stoke Stoke to Bolton

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.200
 and it works out the cost of all those

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.800
 and you can save a load of money.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.240
 A lot of football fans from the FA Cup were using it

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.880
 and they all saved a ton of money.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:13.720
 - Oh yeah, I saw that.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:14.560
 - You went on the news this morning.

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:15.400
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.240
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.360
 - A guy had 52 tickets from one return journey

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.200
 to a football match.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.600
 - 'Cause you need a ticket for each one

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.120
 of these tiny little things

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:24.320
 and so he just has a massive envelope full of tons

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.400
 of tickets and whether ticker inspector comes,

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.160
 you're like, okay, it's definitely one of these.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.000
 - That's amazing.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:30.840
 - Apparently that is true.

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:32.880
 Although I think they're gonna try and make

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.360
 all their tickets a bit easier

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.560
 than that news article I read.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.560
 They're gonna change a lot of the tickets, aren't they?

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.920
 There's something like three million different possible

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.200
 tickets you can buy in the UK

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.600
 and the majority of them have never been bought by anyone.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.440
 - No way.

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.920
 - There's something like that, yeah.

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:47.160
 Anyway, this isn't about trains.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.600
 This is about the Chinese movements of people.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.440
 - Oh yeah.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:51.960
 - So one thing about Chinese New Year

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:55.480
 is that it's very confusing that it's called Spring.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.840
 It's called the Spring Festival

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.720
 because it's obviously in winter.

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.640
 - It's supposed to be like the start of spring, isn't it?

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.000
 - Yeah, but it doesn't feel right.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.120
 - It's so optimistic.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.760
 So I think China divides the year into,

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.760
 is it 20 sections which have different names

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.320
 and then there's one section which is the first section

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:13.440
 of the year which is start of spring

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:16.040
 and that runs for a couple of weeks in mid February.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:18.040
 And so this is called Spring Festival

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:19.880
 'cause I think it's the festival that comes

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.720
 just on the cusp of start of spring period.

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:23.560
 - Right.

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:24.560
 - Which is just, I mean, it's not spring.

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.840
 It's sweet that they're convincing themselves that it is.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:27.920
 - And it's called Chinese New Year.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:28.920
 It doesn't even have a new year.

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.200
 It doesn't even have in first January.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:31.360
 - It's going on.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.200
 - Don't you grow up there.

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.240
 What's this all about?

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.800
 - What's the deal with Chinese New Year?

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.320
 - Did you do the thing where you give each other

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.320
 envelopes with money?

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:40.800
 - Yeah, Lycee, it's called.

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.440
 Or I'd probably pronounce that slightly wrong

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:45.880
 but you used to say Gongsi Fatalai, Sitala,

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:48.840
 and they would give you a red packet with money inside

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.840
 and it was living in Hong Kong

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.160
 which was a very affluent place.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.400
 It was amazing 'cause everyone gave you these packets

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:56.680
 and it was the time to make money if you were a kid.

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.400
 You would just walk around and walk up to adults

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:01.080
 and say Gongsi Fatalai and they'd just give you a red packet.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.800
 And it was, yeah, yeah.

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.600
 So if you went to a party, it was incredible.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.160
 It was like the tooth fairy went nuts

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.840
 and everyone revealed themselves to be that person

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:10.280
 and they're just handing you money.

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:11.120
 - Is it just a kid?

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.040
 'Cause I thought it was everyone

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.160
 and then I thought at the end of the day

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:14.360
 you'd end up equal.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:15.600
 - I left and I was a kid.

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:16.440
 So yeah.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.640
 - You left a new, you stayed.

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:18.840
 Got all the money.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:21.800
 While still a child fled the scene of the crime.

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:24.640
 - Very crafty.

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:26.240
 Just on the, everyone traveling everywhere

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.800
 for Chinese New Year, there has been a story

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.160
 in the news last week about one guy

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.600
 who started cycling home

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.480
 'cause he was very poor, couldn't afford a train ticket,

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.720
 couldn't afford a plane.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:38.720
 So he started cycling really early

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:41.360
 and he cycled for 30 days, he went 300 miles.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:42.920
 So 10 miles a day, it was not great.

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.800
 But, okay, maybe it's a bad bike.

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.640
 Anyway, he then found out.

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:47.480
 - Rocky Turin.

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:48.320
 - Yeah, it was gonna be a Rocky Turin.

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.640
 Exactly, anyway, he then found out

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.960
 he'd be going the wrong direction for 300 miles.

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:52.800
 (laughing)

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:53.640
 - No.

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:55.560
 - Yeah, well, I don't know

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.280
 because he was trying to travel 1000 miles supposedly

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:00.800
 and it meant that he would have had to take three months

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:01.960
 to get home.

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:05.040
 So, I can't quite believe it.

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:06.680
 But apparently he'd been living in internet cafes

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:07.760
 'cause he was really broke.

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.000
 - Yeah, but maybe he thought

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.320
 that it was gonna get more than 10 miles a day, probably.

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:12.320
 - Probably, yeah.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.760
 - Didn't bank on that Rocky Turin and the bad bike.

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:16.960
 (laughing)

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.120
 - Anyway, this was reported in the China People's Daily,

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:21.680
 an organization I have no reason to mistrust.

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.120
 - I remember reading that as well.

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.640
 And the idea was that he kept asking people

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:27.400
 which way to go and they all started telling

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:28.840
 in the wrong direction.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:30.760
 (laughing)

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.280
 - If you kept asking them, presumably,

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.440
 he'd just have gone back and forth over the same 10 miles

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.440
 to get it again and again.

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.440
 (laughing)

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:40.800
 - Just, can I just say something about crowded trains?

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.960
 This is kind of about 'cause I didn't know this was a thing,

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:47.440
 but in Japan, in Tokyo, they have pushers at stations

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.320
 which are people to, I think they're called Oshia

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:53.080
 and they're people to push people onto crowded trains.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:56.000
 And someone described it as perfectly happily.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.720
 Someone who's been pushed by a person said,

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.360
 "It's like if you had a big laundry basket

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:01.360
 "and it's overflowing, you just full stuff in there."

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.280
 - You can see footage of this on YouTube,

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:06.160
 if you look it up and it's extraordinary.

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:09.600
 It's a, there's no more space like literally to even breathe

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:12.040
 and you've got people shoving like crazy

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:13.200
 to get those doors closed.

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.200
 It's astonishing.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.880
 - And they pull people off as well, don't they?

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:16.840
 - That's a bit much.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.240
 (laughing)

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.080
 - Yeah.

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.680
 - How much do you have to give them in a red envelope to do that?

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:22.240
 (laughing)

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.000
 - No, they're called polar offers sometimes.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.080
 - No, they're not.

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:27.120
 - I've seen them called polar offers.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.680
 - Mm, I'm sure.

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:29.520
 - Wow.

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:30.840
 - We used to have, in Hong Kong,

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:34.120
 you used to be able to, in some cases, get your own carriage

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:36.840
 if you were Western because of the number four.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.560
 So the superstition and number four is so great

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:40.840
 that a lot of people wouldn't get anything

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.000
 that had the number four on it.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.320
 - 'Cause it sounds like the word for death is that it?

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.800
 - Which is death and yeah, it's the number four.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.960
 So if, say, a cable car that had number four on it

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.720
 would be empty and so if you were,

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.160
 if they could see a Western family,

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.680
 they would go, come on out, and skip the two.

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:57.880
 - Please, please, get into the death carriage.

00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.960
 (laughing)

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:03.000
 - Yeah.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.560
 - In 2005, this is the period when everyone's going

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.280
 is known as Chunyun, I think.

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:09.120
 - Yeah.

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:13.240
 - So in the 2005 Chunyun period, the train offices

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:17.320
 had certainly less than 100 phone lines,

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:18.760
 more than 10, but less than 100.

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:21.520
 So somewhere in the tens of phone lines

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:25.080
 and they were getting 19.91 million calls per hour.

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:27.320
 (laughing)

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:31.080
 - You are number 10 million and 12 in the queue.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:37.360
 - Just one last thing, it's the Chinese year of the Cockrole

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.120
 that's just started.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.560
 That's 2017.

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:43.080
 Obviously it's every, what is it, every 12?

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:45.520
 - 12 years until you return to your animal.

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:50.600
 - So one of them was 1945 and 1945 was the first time

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:54.960
 that the cartoon character Foghorn Leghorn was ever voiced.

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:57.520
 So here's a year of the Cockrole character.

00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:58.680
 - Oh, that's good.

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:01.400
 - And also, have you heard of Mike the headless chicken?

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:02.240
 - Yeah.

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.080
 - Must have done.

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.640
 He was the guy who there was a family in America

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.280
 and they were chopping the heads off chickens

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:09.040
 and one of them stayed alive and ran around

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:13.400
 for a couple of years and he was born also in 1945.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:16.000
 So he was also a year of the Cockrole guy.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.160
 - Oh, very nice.

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.040
 - You know that all very arrogant though,

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:22.040
 the year of the Cockrole types, the roosters

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.320
 and this year of the roosters, the year of the vein,

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:26.320
 the arrogant and the emotionally volatile.

00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:27.680
 - What are you?

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:29.600
 - I am a tiger.

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.440
 - What's your Chinese New Year side?

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.920
 (laughing)

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:34.760
 - It's interesting.

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:36.960
 So what the description you just made

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:39.240
 is taken very seriously back in China

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:42.360
 and there were certain years where pregnancy rates

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.680
 are extremely low because it's a very bad year

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.560
 and I wish I could remember of the top of my head.

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:49.080
 - And the year of the loser.

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:49.920
 - But you have.

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.680
 (laughing)

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:54.260
 (upbeat music)

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:59.600
 - Okay, it's time for fact number three

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.440
 and that is Drew.

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:02.400
 (laughing)

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:07.400
 - Oh, this is the worst new name I've ever had.

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.560
 I went to an old boy school for 11 years.

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:10.760
 (laughing)

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:12.640
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.880
 and that is Lightning.

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.760
 (laughing)

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:18.600
 - My fact is that the moon has been collecting

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:21.440
 tiny bits of earth for the last three billion years.

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:22.520
 (laughing)

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:23.360
 - Collecting.

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:24.200
 - Collecting.

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:25.040
 - Like a baseball card.

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:26.360
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:28.520
 - Exactly what we're gonna do with them.

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:30.560
 - It's going to, it's got an album

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:32.920
 and it does swapsies with Venus.

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.200
 (laughing)

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.320
 - Yeah, this is really, really cool.

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:39.120
 So there's a new discovery which has been published

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.760
 in nature which is that the moon is dusted

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.960
 in this fine layer of oxygen

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:46.520
 and it was a bit of a puzzle as to how it had got there.

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:49.720
 And it turns out that earth basically has a tail

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:53.680
 of ions and atoms and electrons and things like this

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:56.080
 which lashes out into space behind it.

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:56.920
 - Wow.

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:58.760
 - And normally the moon doesn't get any of it

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.480
 but sometimes when the sun, the earth and the moon

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:04.080
 are all lined up together, the moon is shielded

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:06.120
 from the solar wind, right?

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:09.080
 And then it gets a bit of a lashing of oxygen atoms.

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:12.680
 So the really cool thing is that we don't have much evidence

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:14.280
 of very, very early life on earth

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.240
 like the first bacteria.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.520
 There is a chance that on the moon

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:23.560
 there are fossil bacteria which got blasted out into space,

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:26.560
 ended up on the moon, then got plowed under the moon's surface

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:28.640
 or maybe buried by lava or this kind of thing.

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:31.160
 So there's a chance there are fossils up there

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:34.280
 of bacteria from the very early days of life on earth.

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:36.080
 - Yeah, I mean, pretty unlikely.

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:36.920
 - Pretty unlikely.

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:38.080
 (laughing)

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:39.160
 - That's quite a cool image

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:42.080
 'cause obviously the earth is hurdling through space

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.600
 and it's quite cool to know that we're leaving

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:48.520
 like what an asteroid has that sort of tail out of the back.

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:52.560
 So it stretches all the way around the sun

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.000
 in the path that we go in.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:54.840
 - Yeah.

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:57.080
 - Yeah, scientists call it a large dusty ring.

00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:57.920
 - Hmm.

00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.200
 (laughing)

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.040
 - Good day.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.040
 - Yes, they do.

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.040
 - I don't know why James is cracking up in the morning.

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:04.160
 - I'm not laughing at all.

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.640
 They could do with getting a bigger pump around.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.240
 (laughing)

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:12.680
 - Yeah, the other thing about this tail that we're shedding

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:16.880
 is our magnetic field and it's called a magneto tail,

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:19.240
 is that when it does sweep through the moon,

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.800
 it's full of these really, really hot, charged,

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:24.560
 highly charged particles, which it sheds all over the moon.

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.520
 And that means that on the surface of the moon,

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:30.320
 suddenly voltages can climb up to hundreds and hundreds of volts.

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:32.960
 So the surface of the moon, it's incredibly electric

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.920
 'cause we've just shed all these eyes out.

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:35.760
 - Wow.

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:36.600
 - It's cool, isn't it?

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:39.360
 - So Turecan, and if I stood on the moon,

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:41.320
 then my hair would all go kind of wild

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:43.880
 like had been static electricity fired.

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:44.880
 - God, maybe.

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.080
 - That'd be pretty cool, isn't it?

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.120
 - You'd have to take your helmet off though,

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:48.960
 so you would die, but I think it would be worth it

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:49.800
 to find out.

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.160
 (laughing)

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.640
 - Could you take your helmet off on the moon

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:55.080
 and then put it back on really quickly?

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:56.120
 - Yeah. - If you held your breath.

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:59.560
 - Well, and repressurise your suit and all of that.

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:00.400
 - Yeah, kidding, really?

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.560
 - As in, you can survive in outer space

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:05.920
 for like 20 to 30 seconds without dying.

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:06.840
 - But it's not worth the risk

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:07.680
 'cause imagine if you took it off,

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.440
 your hair went so static that you couldn't fit

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:12.760
 the helmet off. (laughing)

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:14.720
 - Do you know when the astronauts,

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.040
 the fellows landed on the moon?

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:16.880
 What are they called?

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:18.800
 - Armstrong and Aldrin, when they landed on the moon,

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.000
 do you know what the official schedule said?

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.520
 They should do next.

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:23.360
 - What?

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:24.200
 - When they landed on the moon,

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.160
 the official schedule was for them to have a nap.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:28.400
 - Yeah, well that's the whole reason

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:30.560
 that a lot of problems were caused

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.320
 with the actual footage of the moon landing

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:33.920
 because they were asleep.

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:35.560
 - No, 'cause they were not asleep.

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:38.640
 They had scheduled a nap and Armstrong was so awake,

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.960
 he said I'm not having a nap, we're gonna go out now.

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.880
 The problem was is that the wrong side

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:45.600
 of the earth was facing the moon when he wanted to go out.

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:48.960
 So they had to re-root where they were gonna take

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:52.080
 the signal from to bring back the signal of the moon.

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.400
 So Park's observatory in Australia,

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.760
 suddenly were the key people

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:57.600
 because they had access to the moon.

00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.200
 America was on the other side of the...

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.360
 - Wow.

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:02.320
 - All because Neil Armstrong didn't wanna have a nap.

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:03.160
 - He refused to have a nap.

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.120
 So he messed up everything that was meant to happen

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:07.760
 in terms of the televised footage.

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.720
 Do you know what the words of the third man on the moon were?

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:11.560
 - You'll do this.

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:13.200
 - I do, but say it, yeah.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:15.240
 - That's how I should answer everything.

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:18.240
 (all laughing)

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:21.840
 So this is Pete Conrad, who went up in the Apollo 12 mission

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:22.920
 a few years later.

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:24.640
 So he was the third person to walk on the moon

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:26.760
 and he had a bet with a journalist

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:30.080
 who'd bet that NASA dictated what the first words

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:31.560
 of anyone who stepped on the moon had to be

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:34.120
 and he was saying no they don't and I'll prove it.

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:36.680
 So the journalist told him he had to say a particular thing

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:39.200
 and what he said was when he stepped,

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:41.400
 when he took his first step, whoopie.

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.680
 So the thing about this guy was he was a really short guy

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:45.640
 and he stepped out and he said whoopie, man,

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.080
 that may have been a small one for Neil,

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.880
 but that's a long one for me.

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:51.480
 And that was his first words as he stepped out of the spacecraft

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:54.640
 and then actually as he stepped onto the moon itself,

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:58.080
 he said, ooh, is that soft and queasy?

00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.600
 - Wow.

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:03.280
 - Does anyone know the shortest trip ever to the moon?

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:05.120
 - Well, let's engrom it, it didn't take very long at all.

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:05.960
 Is it that one?

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:08.320
 There's a 45 minute special, including the preamble.

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:09.880
 (laughing)

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.320
 - It must be that the moon landed on,

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:13.240
 a bit of the moon landed on Earth and so on.

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:16.200
 - No, no, just as in, I'm genuinely asking the question,

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.400
 of all the times that humans have gone

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.400
 from the Earth to around the moon,

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:22.240
 what's the shortest amount of time it's taken?

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:23.800
 - Do you mean the full trip?

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:25.000
 - All the time. - From here to there.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.080
 - Oh. - From here to there.

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:30.280
 - I would think it would take a couple of days

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:31.120
 to get there.

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.280
 - So. - That's a long way actually.

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:34.240
 It's 250,000 miles can we take.

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:37.400
 - I would say nine hours.

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:38.560
 - Oh, that's so close.

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:39.400
 - Is it?

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:40.760
 - Yeah, eight and a half hours.

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:42.480
 - That's amazing. - Well, 2006,

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.600
 it was a new horizons probe.

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:45.680
 So it didn't land on the moon,

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:48.080
 but it went from the Earth to where the moon is.

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:50.200
 - Eight hours. - In eight and a half hours.

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.040
 - That's crazy.

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:56.280
 - And that was in 2006, and the longest ever was in 2003,

00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:59.320
 and that was one year, one month, and two weeks.

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.080
 It took them to get from here to the moon.

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:03.280
 - Well, they kept asking for directions on the way.

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:04.960
 People kept on messing around with them.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:06.760
 (laughing)

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:08.280
 It's very rocky terrain, it's nice.

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.480
 (laughing)

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:12.840
 - No, that was a deliberate attempt to do it

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:15.480
 with as little kind of fuel as possible.

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:17.320
 - It's little publicity or interest.

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:20.400
 - How are knowing to pull the short straw

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:22.080
 and bid on the year long one?

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:23.640
 Although it's been a people one on these, what are they?

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.520
 - On neither one or any people.

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:26.360
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:27.200
 - When you think that a few hundred years ago,

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:29.280
 it would take six months to get to Australia,

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:31.760
 and now we can go to the moon in eight hours.

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:32.760
 - Yeah.

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:34.560
 - It's a substantial change, it's all the same.

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:35.560
 (laughing)

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:37.960
 - Up until researching this particular fact,

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:40.480
 I would have said, if I was asked the question,

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:42.920
 does the earth get heavier or lighter every year?

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:43.880
 I would have said heavier.

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:45.400
 - You would have said, yeah, I know that,

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:46.400
 but what are you saying?

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.760
 (laughing)

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:49.640
 - Yeah, I would have said heavier

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:50.440
 because I would have thought

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.680
 with the amount of space dust and asteroids passing by,

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:54.680
 we always hear about stuff coming into our atmosphere

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:57.520
 that we would get heavier, but in fact, we do get lighter,

00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.440
 and it's because of all the escaping gas.

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:03.640
 - So we expel in terms of stuff out of the atmosphere

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:05.960
 and out of earth into space every year,

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:09.400
 the equivalent weight of 890,000 humans.

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:10.240
 - Wow.

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:11.080
 - That's how much goes out.

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:15.040
 So that's 50,000 tons that it gets lighter per year,

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:18.040
 and we only take on 40,000 from things

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:20.480
 entering the atmosphere from space.

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:21.320
 - Wow.

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:23.280
 - And helium just goes out into space.

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:24.200
 I had no idea.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:25.040
 - Yeah, it is.

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:27.480
 - When you get a helium balloon and you let go of it,

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:28.320
 that's where it goes.

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:29.960
 - No, well thank God for balloons.

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:31.640
 - The moon is listed with helium balloons.

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:34.400
 - I never appreciated what a great invention balloons were.

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:35.480
 - Right, here's the thing.

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.320
 If you do let a balloon go.

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:38.160
 - Yeah.

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:39.200
 - Words it go.

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.800
 - It goes up all the leaks out of it

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:42.880
 to make its way into space,

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:45.920
 and then the balloon falls down again.

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:48.600
 - Just pops and a bit of plastic goes somewhere.

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:49.440
 - Yeah.

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:51.040
 - And that plastic often ends up in the sea,

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:53.920
 especially in coastal results or anything like that.

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:55.880
 So a lot of places in America,

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:58.880
 especially on the east coast, have banned helium balloons.

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:00.400
 People letting helium balloons go

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.720
 because it just causes so much crap in the sea.

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:03.560
 - Oh really?

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:04.400
 - It's very sensible.

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:05.240
 - Yeah, it's good.

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:06.080
 - Yeah, it makes sense.

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:07.600
 Or you should make all balloons out of fish food.

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:08.440
 - Yeah.

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:09.280
 - Are you in a gradeable balloon?

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:10.120
 - Oh yeah.

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:10.960
 - Yeah.

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:12.200
 - That must be invented.

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.680
 - You can make a puff of fish into a balloon.

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:15.520
 - You could.

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:16.360
 - They do that.

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:17.200
 - They do that.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.560
 - And then you slow it up with an air hose

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:21.920
 like anotelerious Mount Rushmore prank.

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.800
 You let the balloon go and then it's bleeding

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:26.960
 and passing all the gases, stuff, which is so funny.

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.840
 And then it falls into sea and another fish can eat it.

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:30.960
 - They do that in check.

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:31.960
 Not the whole story.

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:35.160
 They don't chew the club, but they don't love a fish

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:36.200
 into a balloon.

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:38.780
 (upbeat music)

00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:45.520
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:48.640
 and that is Chuzinski.

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:51.480
 - My fact this week is that the most deadly user

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:56.480
 of Portuguese Man of War Venom is not the Portuguese Man of War.

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:59.840
 So the most deadly user of the Portuguese Man of War's Venom

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:03.080
 is something that's called a blue dragon sea slug,

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:04.880
 which is the most beautiful creature.

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:08.680
 If you look it up, it's a kind of nudibranque

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.800
 which are these little slug-like sea creatures.

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.800
 It's really lovely looking.

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.560
 And what it does is it goes and eats the Venom

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:15.960
 on the Portuguese Man of War

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:18.720
 and then it has these special limbs,

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:21.560
 these special organs that are especially for storing Venom

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:23.840
 and it pushes it out into these little organs.

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:26.040
 These finger-like branches

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:29.040
 and it is more concentrated at the end of those branches

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:30.560
 than it is in the Portuguese Man of War.

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:33.200
 And so when it administers the Venom to someone,

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.880
 it's actually more effective than when the Portuguese Man of War

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:38.000
 does it in Nixit and it makes it better.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.680
 - But it doesn't kill the Portuguese Man of War.

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:43.120
 It just uses it like a gas station.

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:45.400
 Like it goes up and it just fills up on its Venom.

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:46.600
 So it sucks it out.

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:47.800
 - And it hurts it as well.

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:48.640
 - Yeah.

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:51.640
 - It's like being hurt at a gas station.

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:54.160
 (laughing)

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:56.720
 And that happens to me quite a lot of petrol stations

00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:58.120
 'cause I always try to haggle.

00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:01.800
 So is it the, so it's the nudibranque who gets hurt?

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:02.880
 - The nudibranque gets hurt.

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:04.360
 It does have special adaptations

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:06.480
 to stop it being too badly injured by the poison

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:07.320
 'cause it's really poisonous.

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:09.360
 So it has sort of special mucus,

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.040
 which helps to shield it a bit.

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:13.040
 And then, yeah, and then it adapts the stuff.

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:14.880
 - Can I ask about nudibranque, really?

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:17.880
 - So you would think if you saw a drawing, in the first time,

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:19.400
 I think most people did see it,

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:22.160
 was a drawing and it was from Captain Cook's Voyages.

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:24.960
 It was the artist who did an illustration of it.

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:25.920
 You would think it's fake.

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:29.560
 You would think that this was a made up secreture.

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:33.040
 And it's phenomenal 'cause it swims upside down.

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:33.880
 - Yeah.

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.760
 - And that's a kind of camouflage tactic.

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:38.200
 - And it floats upside down at the surface.

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:39.840
 Who's to say what's upside down then?

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:41.520
 If that's how it lives, it's whole life.

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:42.360
 - Yes.

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:43.200
 - That's a good point.

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.840
 So you're saying maybe all other animals are wrong?

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:49.160
 - No, what I'm saying is if all humans walked around

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:51.680
 with their head near the floor and their feet in the air,

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:53.320
 then we would think that was the right way up.

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:54.160
 - Exactly.

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:55.000
 - Yeah.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.720
 - It's like saying to a bat, you sleep upside down.

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:57.560
 - But they do.

00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:58.560
 - 'Cause I always sleep, I sleep.

00:28:58.560 --> 00:28:59.560
 - Yeah, this is the right way up.

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:00.400
 - This is the right way up.

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:01.440
 - Well, why are we launching this war

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:04.160
 on correct placement of things?

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:05.000
 - You started it.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.720
 - Why did it not say it?

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:08.640
 - I just don't see that you can say

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.480
 that he's swimming upside down.

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:12.040
 If he spends his whole life upside down,

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:13.720
 maybe that's the correct way for him to live.

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:15.960
 - Does he spend his whole life upside down?

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:17.160
 - I don't think so.

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:20.880
 - Okay, so the way he floats is he inflates his stomach.

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.680
 So I think maybe it's all about what's the back

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:23.520
 and what's the stomach.

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:25.040
 And the way that this guy floats

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:27.640
 is by filling his stomach with gas.

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:30.760
 And then he bobbles up to the top of the surface of the ocean.

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:33.040
 And then he has his stomach keeping him afloat.

00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:35.240
 - Prime candidate for this new animal balloon

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:36.240
 we've been talking about.

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:38.480
 (laughing)

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:39.960
 - Well, here's another thing about Needy Banks.

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:42.320
 So they all have their anus above their head.

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:43.160
 - Yeah.

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:44.640
 - Which James is gonna say is perfectly normal

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:46.000
 and why don't we all do it?

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.400
 - No, what I'm saying is, maybe if you look at him

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:52.000
 the other way up, which is how he wants to be looked,

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.080
 that his head is in a perfectly normal position.

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:56.920
 - No, because they twist around as they grow.

00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:58.200
 - So they start off with their anus

00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:59.880
 not near their head and then as they grow,

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:01.200
 I think we talked about this with...

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.040
 - Snails.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:02.880
 - Snails recently.

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:04.280
 So same thing, you see slugs.

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:07.120
 Their body twists 180 degrees as they grow.

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:08.320
 So they're gills on their anus

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.000
 that are right by the...

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.920
 - Who's to say that when they're a baby nudie brink

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:14.560
 that they're not upside down then

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:16.240
 and they flip to be the right way around?

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.440
 - You would be like us being born in a hand stamp

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:19.960
 as you shouldn't, and us realizing

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:22.000
 this didn't feel so right.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.200
 - I'm just like, I can't wait for my anus

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.320
 to be nearer of my head.

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:25.840
 Is that what they're all saying?

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:27.120
 (laughing)

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:28.680
 Can't wait for all the girls to fancy people

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:31.920
 when they see how close to my head, my anus is.

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:33.560
 (laughing)

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:34.400
 - That would...

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:35.240
 Their parents must say to them,

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:36.800
 "These really are the best days of your life."

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:38.120
 (laughing)

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:40.120
 - You know, enjoy these days of distance

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:42.000
 between your head and your anus when you get.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.240
 (laughing)

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:48.320
 - There are nudier ranks which have disposable penises.

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:49.160
 - Okay.

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:50.000
 - So they're an afterlife.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.520
 So they both have a penis on their right-hand side.

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:53.040
 So they stand next to each other.

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:54.560
 - How do you know it's a right-hand side?

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:55.400
 - They're not like that.

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:58.360
 (laughing)

00:30:58.360 --> 00:30:59.480
 - So they stand next to each other

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:01.200
 facing in opposite directions.

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:02.040
 - Yeah.

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:03.040
 - And then they sort of lock their penises

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:03.880
 into each other.

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:04.720
 - Yeah.

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:05.640
 - And they transfer sperm both ways.

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:07.200
 But then their penises break off

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:09.640
 and fall to the ocean surface.

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:10.920
 - Do you think that's a really terrifying moment

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:11.880
 the first time it happens?

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:13.280
 (laughing)

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:15.480
 - I imagine it only happens once.

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:16.920
 - No, does it?

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:19.680
 - So they drop off, fall to the bottom of the sea.

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:21.960
 And then within 24 hours sometimes,

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:23.760
 they've regenerated a new one.

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:26.120
 'Cause most of that penis is a big coil inside them

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:27.680
 and it just grows out again.

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:28.520
 - Oh cool.

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:30.240
 - They would have noticed that

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:33.640
 when they were a younger nudie branch alone in their shell,

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:36.360
 having a little touch of themselves.

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:39.680
 - I think a vigorous session might result in it.

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:41.760
 - But again, the first time it happens,

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:42.960
 it would be terrifying.

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:44.280
 - That's true.

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:47.080
 - You couldn't come back home after a night out

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:49.640
 if you'd been sleeping around.

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:51.400
 You couldn't come back home to your wife

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:53.120
 and say, "Oh, nothing happened."

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:55.400
 She's like, "Well, why'd you cut, followed up then?"

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:58.400
 (laughing)

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:02.400
 - So another nudie branch is solar-powered one.

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:04.720
 If you guys spread about this one, it's so cool.

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.200
 So it harvests.

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:07.680
 It basically farms algae.

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:12.200
 It eats algae and then it uses the photosynthesis

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:13.040
 of the algae.

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:16.320
 So the algae inside it photosynthesizes using the sun.

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:20.000
 And then this is what this nudie branch gets its energy from.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.480
 And it has these little solar panels.

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:23.800
 So if you look at it, you can see these little brown spots

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:25.720
 on it, which are the specific zones

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:26.960
 where it's put its algae

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:28.600
 so that it can get the light from the sun

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:29.880
 so that it can photosynthesize.

00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:31.760
 - Aren't we all solar powered?

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:33.880
 - But we're not using photosynthesis.

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:37.400
 And so they get the chloroplasts from the seaweed,

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:38.960
 like the little green bits.

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:41.280
 And that turns the sunlight into energy.

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:42.280
 - Okay, well, that's pretty much it.

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:45.880
 - So they can live for a year on sunlight alone, on solar.

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:46.720
 - Wow.

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:48.480
 - And you're right that all of our energy

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:49.880
 eventually comes from the sun.

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:52.480
 - Yeah, so like as humans, we're solar powered.

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:53.320
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:54.160
 - That was pretty much.

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:55.840
 - Never thought of being solar powered before,

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:57.080
 but I am.

00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:57.920
 - Well done.

00:32:57.920 --> 00:32:58.760
 (laughing)

00:32:58.760 --> 00:32:59.600
 - You are.

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.520
 - It's worth knowing that about yourself.

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:02.360
 - Yeah.

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:06.000
 - So I grew up in Australia in my, after I took the money

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.360
 and run from Hong Kong, and along the beaches,

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:12.120
 you get blue bottles and blue bottles

00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:13.960
 in reading up about Portuguese Manor War

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:15.560
 are the same kind of thing.

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:16.960
 It's the same kind of animal.

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:17.960
 And I thought that was an animal.

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:19.120
 I thought it was a jellyfish.

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:21.200
 So I've just discovered today that Portuguese Manor War

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:25.720
 is basically a team effort of a bunch of different creatures

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:26.720
 working as one.

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:27.560
 - Yeah.

00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:28.840
 - Like when the power range is combined

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:30.680
 to be that giant robot thing,

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:32.800
 it's like that's what a Portuguese Manor War is.

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:34.320
 - Yeah, that's a really good analogy actually.

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:36.480
 - So I'm really confused about this.

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:39.000
 I read somewhere that they were different species,

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.600
 but they're not different species.

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:43.800
 They're different kinds of animal

00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:46.160
 in the same species, all working together,

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:48.800
 all having different things that they specialize in.

00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:51.440
 - So someone will be responsible for the sex, fun job,

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:53.120
 someone's responsible for the digestion,

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:54.760
 also quite a fun job.

00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:56.120
 And then there's probably someone responsible

00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:58.880
 for sort of pooing and stuff, which is probably less fun.

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:01.720
 But yeah, it's like, they're called Siphonophores.

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:02.720
 Siphonophores.

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.920
 And yeah, it's a bunch of tiny organisms

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:05.920
 which all perform-

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:07.360
 - Dinosaur, yeah.

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:10.200
 - They do, I'd never thought about their name before

00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:11.520
 and why they're called that.

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:13.760
 And they're called that because they look like a Portuguese Manor

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:15.240
 like a sailing boat.

00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:16.920
 And they really do.

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:18.280
 And they've got this kind of sail

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:19.840
 that sticks up out of the water.

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:22.160
 And it performs the purpose of a sail,

00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:23.000
 which I didn't know.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.640
 So the way they get around is by, you know,

00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:27.720
 actively, you have to mate in sailing around

00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:29.120
 by sticking their sail up in the water.

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:30.120
 - Underwater.

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:31.120
 - No, no, above the water.

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:31.960
 - Above the water.

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:34.560
 - They have a surface sail that takes them to places.

00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:36.360
 - The sail sticks up above the water, it catches the wind.

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:39.200
 And then another good candidate for the balloon,

00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:40.400
 they can deflate their sail

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:42.760
 if they see a threat coming along like a turtle.

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:43.760
 It's gonna make them.

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.120
 And then they re-inflate it when it's gone.

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:46.320
 - That's amazing.

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:48.800
 - So you know how some animals are unbelievably poisonous

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:49.640
 to humans.

00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:52.240
 Like there are frogs that can kill a thousand people

00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:53.360
 with a single thing.

00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:56.040
 Yeah, I was reading an article about why this is the case.

00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:59.000
 Why is it useful for a frog to be able to kill a thousand people

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.440
 with a single thing?

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:01.760
 And the really interesting thing is,

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:03.720
 it's not useful at all, right?

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:05.440
 It just happens that we're measuring

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:07.400
 how many humans something could kill.

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:09.640
 Or a snake can kill a quarter of a million mice.

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.480
 It would be pointless for the snake.

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:14.200
 But the thing is, animals always adapt their poison

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:15.800
 to what they're hunting, right?

00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:17.600
 So there are loads of, for example,

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:21.160
 hedgehogs that could survive a bite from a snake

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:24.120
 which would kill a person much, much bigger.

00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:26.480
 But hedgehogs and snakes are in an arms race

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:27.880
 of who's going to develop more poison

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:30.320
 or better poison resistance, right?

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:33.680
 So if you find a snake which is unbelievably poisonous,

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:36.160
 you can bet there's probably a little rodent out there

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:38.000
 which is unbelievably tough

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.120
 and could take a huge amount of poison before dying.

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:43.600
 - So I wonder with those little kind of tiny,

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:46.040
 little colourful frogs that live in the Amazon.

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:47.200
 - Yeah.

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:49.200
 - What you're saying is there's some animal there

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:52.120
 that is super hardcore that you just can't poison.

00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:54.440
 - Yeah, we don't know what it feels on them

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:56.800
 that is nearly resistant to their poison maybe

00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:59.320
 and so they're having to constantly become more poisonous.

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:01.640
 - You know that the Brazilian wandering spider

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:03.840
 can give you when it bites you an erection.

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:07.160
 So intense that you become impotent.

00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:09.640
 - That is tough, isn't it?

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:12.520
 - Well, James found what I think is the best headlight

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:13.360
 of the year so far.

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:15.840
 I know we're just into early February,

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:17.960
 but it was that, what was it?

00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:18.800
 - James, it was--

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:23.360
 - Something like Mafia Boss with Permanent erection arrested.

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:24.960
 - Yeah, finally arrested.

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:27.800
 Mafia Boss with Permanent erection, finally arrested.

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:31.960
 And he has a disease that means that he has a Permanent erection

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:33.240
 and so throughout the whole article,

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:34.440
 they're talking about his court case

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:36.320
 and he's sitting in court.

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:39.400
 It says with bag of ice on his genitals.

00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:40.240
 - He just--

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:41.080
 - Permanent erection.

00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:43.080
 - He didn't want it to stand up and cut.

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:44.720
 (laughing)

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:47.320
 (upbeat music)

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:51.640
 - Okay, that's it, that's all of our facts.

00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:53.040
