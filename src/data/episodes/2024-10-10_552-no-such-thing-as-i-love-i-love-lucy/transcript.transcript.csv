00:00:00,00:00:06,"Hello everybody, it's Dan and Andy here from the podcast No Such Things a Fish, which you're already listening to."
00:00:06,00:00:13,Yeah. Why are we here Andy? We're here to let everyone know that they can see us in the flesh.
00:00:13,00:00:17,I thought we were here as a social thing. I can't believe it. You've yured me into recording an Amphir.
00:00:17,00:00:19,I know. The other two saw through it. That's why it's you and me alone.
00:00:19,00:00:27,"But basically, we are concluding the UK and European leg of our Thunder Nerds tour."
00:00:27,00:00:33,Or we only have four dates left. We're going to be playing Cardiff. We're going to be playing London twice and Manchester.
00:00:33,00:00:38,And then kaput. That is it. It is over. And we still have some tickets left for a few of those shows.
00:00:38,00:00:41,"So if you want to come and see us, now is the time to get them."
00:00:41,00:00:46,That's right. You can get tickets. There are still some available for Cardiff and there are still some available for the second London date.
00:00:46,00:00:50,So Cardiff is on the 16th of October at the Wales Millennium Centre.
00:00:50,00:00:54,"London is the first one is sold out completely. The second one, there are still a few tickets left."
00:00:54,00:00:59,That's on the 24th of October at the Theatre Royal on Drury Lane.
00:00:59,00:01:04,So a couple of tickets are available for those two shows. And I'd say buy them now before the show.
00:01:04,00:01:08,"Yeah, we can't wait to see a bunch of you there. It's so fun. We have exciting guests."
00:01:08,00:01:13,We have quizzes that we do on stage. We record an original new podcast each time.
00:01:13,00:01:18,And we usually get a lot of weird stuff out of Andy to do with a very specific sci-fi movie.
00:01:18,00:01:24,"So yeah, a little teaser there. So when you come along, come and see us live."
00:01:24,00:01:28,Go to knowsuchthingasafish.com. All the links are there to get your tickets from.
00:01:28,00:01:32,"And yeah, we'll hopefully see you there soon. All right, let's get on to the actual podcast itself."
00:01:32,00:01:35,"Are we going to order a coffee at any point? No, I'm going home now. Okay."
00:01:35,00:01:37,"All right, on with the show. Bye."
00:01:50,00:01:59,"Hello and welcome to another episode of Know Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Newcastle."
00:01:59,00:02:09,"My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin."
00:02:09,00:02:14,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days."
00:02:14,00:02:21,"And in no particular order, here we go, starting with fact number one. And that is Anna."
00:02:21,00:02:27,My fact this week is that British children have been asked to stop digging holes on beaches.
00:02:27,00:02:31,"After they dug one so big, it had to be filled in with a forklift truck."
00:02:31,00:02:37,They're hard to get rid of. And this is a waste of public resources or this farmer's resources.
00:02:37,00:02:41,"So this was the Coast Guard in Padstow, who had to deal with this one."
00:02:41,00:02:48,It was eight feet deep. That's deep. And nine foot wide.
00:02:48,00:02:54,"That's a source of more of a trap than a harmless activity, isn't it? It is."
00:02:54,00:02:58,"Well, I think I was wondering why I was so wide, because I'd always just make quite narrow holes."
00:02:58,00:03:02,"But if you're going that deep, you have to get people in it to dig it, don't you?"
00:03:02,00:03:05,So I suppose it does need to widen. But that does make it really hard to fill in.
00:03:05,00:03:11,"When it takes ages, they had to call Charlie Watson Smythe from Padstow Farm."
00:03:11,00:03:14,And he popped over and filled it in with his forklift truck.
00:03:14,00:03:18,Have you guys heard of the St Andrews Hole Digging Society?
00:03:18,00:03:23,No. Is it to do with golf? It sounds like it. It's not. It's a beach thing.
00:03:23,00:03:27,"So it's only been going a few years, but I'm sure it'll last for many more."
00:03:27,00:03:31,"So every fortnight, you just go onto the beach and you start digging a hole."
00:03:31,00:03:34,Is it in St Andrews in Scotland? Yeah. Cool.
00:03:34,00:03:37,"People contribute to one main hole each time, but you can do your own thing."
00:03:37,00:03:42,"They're not prescriptive. And basically, the guy who founded it said it's a really nice way"
00:03:42,00:03:49,for men to do something together where you don't have to make eye contact with each other.
00:03:49,00:03:52,And that is what all men's activities basically are.
00:03:52,00:03:55,Do they cover up the holes at the end of the night?
00:03:55,00:03:58,I think they might fill it back in. I think they might be responsible diggers.
00:03:58,00:04:02,"So when the wives said, ""Where have you been?"" they say, ""Oh, we were digging holes, but we filled them all in."""
00:04:02,00:04:05,But that's honestly what we were doing.
00:04:05,00:04:08,I think that's really nice. That's great.
00:04:08,00:04:12,I think that is just going against the public service announcement that I was trying to make with this fact.
00:04:12,00:04:15,"Now you're telling everyone about the society, where you go and dig a hole."
00:04:15,00:04:17,That's true. I think they are very dangerous.
00:04:17,00:04:25,"The other week, I was on a beach and my son dug a hole, which couldn't have been more than, I think, 30 centimetres deep, right?"
00:04:25,00:04:28,"And it was quite wide, but he put a little blanket over it."
00:04:28,00:04:32,"And he said, ""Daddy, come over here. I've got something for you."""
00:04:32,00:04:35,"And he said, ""Leave a little plastic Loch Ness monster on there."""
00:04:35,00:04:37,"Dad, I found it."
00:04:37,00:04:41,"He said, ""Dad, come, come."" And I saw it. I knew it, because I'd watched him dig the hole, right?"
00:04:41,00:04:45,"And I sat down, obviously faking it, and fell into the hole."
00:04:45,00:04:48,"Vanilla, my wife, had to pick me out of it. My back was gone."
00:04:48,00:04:52,I was feeling so embarrassing from just like that.
00:04:52,00:04:54,"So, you know, you've got to be careful."
00:04:54,00:04:56,They're dangerous. They can even be lethal.
00:04:56,00:05:01,"Some more dangerous things on beaches, umbrellas, due to wind."
00:05:01,00:05:06,"They send approximately 3,000 people to hospital every year in the US,"
00:05:06,00:05:09,according to the US Consumer Product Safety Commission.
00:05:09,00:05:13,They don't send them literally by holding on.
00:05:13,00:05:15,"This is very poppin' zip, yeah."
00:05:15,00:05:20,"Just next to the H for the helipad, there's a little U."
00:05:20,00:05:25,"There's a lightning, because as we all know, lightning doesn't strike at sea."
00:05:25,00:05:32,"Please don't write in again. Listen, I made a claim that lightning rarely strikes at sea."
00:05:32,00:05:37,"A lot of people just selectively didn't hear the word ""rarely"" and have been inundating the inbox."
00:05:37,00:05:41,"Well, the truth is that it does rarely strike at sea, but if you're on the beach,"
00:05:41,00:05:46,"you're often going to be the tallest person, or not the tallest person, but the tallest thing."
00:05:46,00:05:47,"On a beach, yeah."
00:05:47,00:05:50,"Because there's not buildings around, there's not trees around, so you might get hit."
00:05:50,00:05:55,"And of course, jellyfish. And what do you think? Should we on jellyfish stings?"
00:05:55,00:05:57,"What do you think, people of Newcastle?"
00:05:57,00:05:59,Go!
00:05:59,00:06:03,"Okay, there was a very loud yes, but I think that was more recreational than medical."
00:06:03,00:06:05,It's a no.
00:06:05,00:06:06,"It doesn't really help, does it?"
00:06:06,00:06:10,"No, there's been 10 papers that have tested it, and none of them were positive."
00:06:10,00:06:15,"About half of them have said it makes matters worse, and half said it doesn't make any difference at all."
00:06:15,00:06:19,"It makes matters worse, because now you're embarrassed as well as today."
00:06:19,00:06:27,"What you need to do is apply baking soda slurry, which is 50% baking soda and 50% seawater."
00:06:27,00:06:28,Now.
00:06:28,00:06:35,"But that is for all jellyfish, apart from caribdia marsupialis and crissiora heisosella,"
00:06:35,00:06:40,in which case you absolutely must not apply baking soda slurry.
00:06:40,00:06:41,"Oh, what happens?"
00:06:41,00:06:42,"It makes it way, way worse."
00:06:42,00:06:46,"It's like when you put mentos inside a cake bottle, is that just..."
00:06:46,00:06:50,"See, I think that's a good argument for just weeing on the wound."
00:06:50,00:06:51,Probably won't make it too much worse.
00:06:51,00:06:52,The odds of getting it...
00:06:52,00:06:55,I don't have time to do a DNA test on this jellyfish.
00:06:55,00:06:56,It's just stung me.
00:06:56,00:06:59,Surely everyone knows a crissiora heisosella when they see one.
00:06:59,00:07:01,"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:07:01,00:07:02,That's very funny.
00:07:02,00:07:07,"I found a professional sandcastle maker, did you, who..."
00:07:07,00:07:11,"I read a profile of her, and she's called Janelle Hawkins."
00:07:11,00:07:12,Yeah.
00:07:12,00:07:14,It just sounds a lot like James Harkin.
00:07:14,00:07:15,Does it?
00:07:15,00:07:16,That's funny.
00:07:16,00:07:17,We're supposed to be surprised by that.
00:07:17,00:07:18,It's a bit like James Harkin.
00:07:18,00:07:19,Janelle Hawkins.
00:07:19,00:07:20,"Janelle Hawkins, yeah."
00:07:20,00:07:21,Spooky.
00:07:21,00:07:22,He's very spooky.
00:07:22,00:07:23,Spooky.
00:07:23,00:07:26,"The thing is, Andy, I am not a sandcastle maker."
00:07:26,00:07:27,No.
00:07:27,00:07:29,Did you have anything else?
00:07:29,00:07:34,"And I noticed that my default was defending you, but even I was not into that one either."
00:07:34,00:07:35,Is that all on her?
00:07:35,00:07:36,Can we move on?
00:07:36,00:07:37,Or is it...?
00:07:37,00:07:38,Let's move on.
00:07:38,00:07:39,"Okay, great."
00:07:39,00:07:45,"So, it is worth digging holes on some beaches, specifically Folkestone Beach."
00:07:45,00:07:46,Oh.
00:07:46,00:07:51,"So, quite a long way for you guys to go in Newcastle, but if you are in Kent, there are still gold bars buried there."
00:07:51,00:07:53,I've been to Folkestone Beach as a child.
00:07:53,00:07:55,There are gold bars under the surface.
00:07:55,00:07:57,"Yeah, well, you and Andy, you could have come away a millionaire."
00:07:57,00:08:02,"Well, not a millionaire, technically, but in 2014, so actually after you were a child."
00:08:02,00:08:03,Thank you.
00:08:03,00:08:10,"In 2014, an artist called Michael Salesstorfer buried £10,000 worth of gold bars there as an art installation."
00:08:10,00:08:11,Wow.
00:08:11,00:08:12,Quite a cool idea.
00:08:12,00:08:17,"He said, ""I'm making a constantly changing sculpture because everyone's going to be constantly digging up the beach."""
00:08:17,00:08:21,"I know it's making someone else do his work for him, but if you dug up one of these bars,"
00:08:21,00:08:27,"of which there were, I think, a lot, about 30, they were either worth £250 or £500,"
00:08:27,00:08:30,"and some people said they'd dug them up, but we reckon there are quite a few left."
00:08:30,00:08:31,Cool.
00:08:31,00:08:32,"So, it's worth it."
00:08:32,00:08:33,"Oh, yeah."
00:08:33,00:08:35,"A lot of people spend their life digging, right?"
00:08:35,00:08:37,"Like, for various reasons, for work, we're on a beach."
00:08:37,00:08:39,We're constantly just digging holes into the ground.
00:08:39,00:08:46,"And I always thought, ""I wonder, like, you know, how close to the centre do you get when you're digging down?"""
00:08:46,00:08:54,"So the deepest hole we've ever dug, which was in Russia, has gone down 12,376 metres."
00:08:54,00:08:58,"That's the deepest one, and that is called the Kola Superdeep borehole."
00:08:58,00:09:03,"To put that in context, if you scaled the earth to the size of an apple,"
00:09:03,00:09:09,the depth that we've gone hasn't even broken through the top layer of skin of the apple.
00:09:09,00:09:12,But the earth is almost the opposite of an apple.
00:09:12,00:09:16,"With the apple, the best bit is the stuff inside, and the cross bit is rubbish."
00:09:16,00:09:21,"Whereas on the earth, I think one of the reasons we haven't gone down is it's not really nice down there, is it?"
00:09:21,00:09:26,"It's not like, do you think if we just go 15,000 metres, we'll be like, ""Oh my God, there's a whole other..."""
00:09:26,00:09:31,"No, they couldn't go any further. They didn't get 13,000 metres down and went,"
00:09:31,00:09:33,"""It's not great down here."""
00:09:33,00:09:38,"Dan, I love the idea of your son putting a little tartan blanket over the Kola Superdeep borehole"
00:09:38,00:09:41,and leering you over to it.
00:09:41,00:09:44,Have you seen the Superdeep borehole?
00:09:44,00:09:45,Yes.
00:09:45,00:09:47,"It's pretty small, isn't it? You could fall down it, I don't think."
00:09:47,00:09:49,"No, no. You could."
00:09:49,00:09:50,It's nine inches across.
00:09:50,00:09:56,"And on top of it, it's like a little manhole cover that it really looks like you could just undo."
00:09:56,00:09:59,"If you dropped a pebble in it, you bet you couldn't even hear it hit the bottom."
00:09:59,00:10:01,I shouldn't think so.
00:10:01,00:10:05,"We're so much better than all other animals at digging holes, but I was..."
00:10:05,00:10:07,Do you mean with our hands?
00:10:07,00:10:10,"No, sorry, because we've built those amazing machinery."
00:10:10,00:10:12,So other animals don't go that far into the ground.
00:10:12,00:10:14,"That feels a bit unfair, Ben."
00:10:14,00:10:18,"That's like saying we fly better than any animal, because we have the world."
00:10:18,00:10:19,True as well.
00:10:19,00:10:20,Yeah.
00:10:20,00:10:24,"I was just surprised at the animal that has dug the second deepest, aside from us."
00:10:24,00:10:26,And I think it's cool and terrifying.
00:10:26,00:10:27,"Oh, what is it?"
00:10:27,00:10:28,What is it?
00:10:28,00:10:29,A Nile crocodile.
00:10:29,00:10:30,Yes.
00:10:30,00:10:31,What?
00:10:31,00:10:32,It's cool that they go...
00:10:32,00:10:34,With those little arms.
00:10:34,00:10:37,"They actually do it terrifyingly with their jaws, apparently."
00:10:37,00:10:38,Really?
00:10:38,00:10:40,"And they've gone down 12 metres, which is..."
00:10:40,00:10:42,That's quite a lot less than us.
00:10:42,00:10:44,"Yeah, it does sound terrifying."
00:10:44,00:10:46,"It's a distant second place, isn't it?"
00:10:46,00:10:47,"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:10:47,00:10:51,Is it because they realised sooner that there wasn't nice appellee stuff down there than we did?
00:10:51,00:10:53,Deepest hole in Newcastle?
00:10:53,00:10:57,"It's... I'm not going to answer that, in fact."
00:10:57,00:10:59,Nice.
00:10:59,00:11:01,But there is an official deepest hole in Newcastle.
00:11:01,00:11:03,"It is. It's just outside St James's Park, isn't it?"
00:11:03,00:11:04,The fact is just down there.
00:11:04,00:11:05,It's just the other side of this.
00:11:05,00:11:06,The science one.
00:11:06,00:11:09,"The one that's 2,000 metres."
00:11:09,00:11:10,"Yeah, yeah."
00:11:10,00:11:11,Really?
00:11:11,00:11:13,The Newcastle Science Central deep geothermal borehole.
00:11:13,00:11:16,"They wanted to dig a geothermal hole, you know, dig down."
00:11:16,00:11:17,Right.
00:11:17,00:11:18,You've got free hot water forever.
00:11:18,00:11:20,And that's near St James's Park.
00:11:20,00:11:23,"Andy, another hole and James connection."
00:11:23,00:11:28,"I'm back on board, baby!"
00:11:28,00:11:30,The last one wasn't really a hole connection.
00:11:30,00:11:33,There's much as a sandcastle connection.
00:11:33,00:11:35,"I'm back out, baby."
00:11:35,00:11:37,I just... I love...
00:11:37,00:11:39,I found a headline in the local newspaper.
00:11:39,00:11:40,Is it The Chronicle?
00:11:40,00:11:44,What has the borehole done for Newcastle?
00:11:44,00:11:46,"Conclusion was very little, sadly."
00:11:46,00:11:47,"Well, it gave us..."
00:11:47,00:11:50,"It made us know that Newcastle,"
00:11:50,00:11:53,"many, many million years ago, was a tropical environment."
00:11:53,00:11:54,Mmm.
00:11:54,00:11:56,I don't know what you can do with that information.
00:11:56,00:11:57,Right.
00:11:57,00:12:00,"But maybe that's why people in Newcastle go with their tops off all the time,"
00:12:00,00:12:03,because they're harkening to a better time.
00:12:03,00:12:04,Long memory.
00:12:04,00:12:08,"Just, I have a hole digger, a favourite hole digger person."
00:12:08,00:12:09,Who is it?
00:12:09,00:12:11,"Well, I realised, as I said that,"
00:12:11,00:12:13,that it's actually somebody who specifically didn't dig his own holes.
00:12:13,00:12:14,He had holes dug for him.
00:12:14,00:12:15,OK.
00:12:15,00:12:17,"But it's Bernard Clevo,"
00:12:17,00:12:18,who I...
00:12:18,00:12:20,"It's one of my favourite people,"
00:12:20,00:12:23,"because I'm quite into medieval Christian sects,"
00:12:23,00:12:25,and he was the founder of the Knights Templars.
00:12:25,00:12:26,She said sect.
00:12:26,00:12:27,"Oh, it was sect."
00:12:27,00:12:28,Yeah.
00:12:28,00:12:29,It was sect.
00:12:29,00:12:31,"That's a hell of a Tinder profile, isn't it?"
00:12:31,00:12:32,Yeah.
00:12:32,00:12:34,I'm really into medieval sects.
00:12:34,00:12:36,I own my own Wimple.
00:12:36,00:12:37,Right.
00:12:37,00:12:39,I will bring my own root scrape.
00:12:39,00:12:40,Yeah.
00:12:40,00:12:43,We're all having to readjust now
00:12:43,00:12:45,"to just be interested in what you're about to say,"
00:12:45,00:12:48,as opposed to what we were hoping you were going to say.
00:12:48,00:12:51,"I know, picturing sort of monks with dildos."
00:12:51,00:12:52,OK.
00:12:52,00:12:53,Coming around.
00:12:53,00:12:54,"OK, Anna."
00:12:54,00:12:55,Did you have a fact here?
00:12:55,00:12:57,"Oh, yes, sorry."
00:12:57,00:12:58,Bernard Clevo.
00:12:58,00:13:00,"Yeah, co-founder of the Knights Templar."
00:13:00,00:13:04,"He was this Albert, a very, very leading Christian thinker."
00:13:04,00:13:06,And this just goes to show what good friends will do.
00:13:06,00:13:09,So the fellow monks at the monastery absolutely adored him.
00:13:09,00:13:11,He was their spiritual leader.
00:13:11,00:13:15,They knew that he was so devout that he went to excessive lengths.
00:13:15,00:13:16,He went to excessive fasting.
00:13:16,00:13:19,"So he would starve himself, basically, to show his devoutness."
00:13:19,00:13:21,And that caused gastric problems.
00:13:21,00:13:23,But he was so busy praying in the chapel that he never
00:13:23,00:13:25,wanted to leave until the last minute.
00:13:25,00:13:27,So he could never get to the loon time.
00:13:27,00:13:30,So his monks kept on digging and re-digging him a poo hole
00:13:30,00:13:33,just outside the chapel so that he could dash out
00:13:33,00:13:36,"the last minute, drop the cassock, you know,"
00:13:36,00:13:38,plop in there and dash back in.
00:13:38,00:13:40,"And that's, if that's not friendship."
00:13:40,00:13:41,That's friendship.
00:13:41,00:13:42,That's beautiful.
00:13:42,00:13:44,"I was going to quickly, there's lots of different types of holes."
00:13:44,00:13:46,So I was going to do a very quick quiz to see
00:13:46,00:13:49,if you could guess what these holes are.
00:13:49,00:13:50,So here's the first one.
00:13:50,00:13:51,Yule hole.
00:13:51,00:13:52,What's a little hole?
00:13:52,00:13:53,Christmas hole.
00:13:53,00:13:54,It's the opposite of a Christmas tree.
00:13:54,00:13:56,You just dig a nice yule hole.
00:13:56,00:13:58,"If you can't afford a tree, trees are expensive."
00:13:58,00:14:01,You just throw the tinsel in the hole.
00:14:01,00:14:02,Lovely.
00:14:02,00:14:03,Yeah.
00:14:03,00:14:04,He's got it right.
00:14:04,00:14:07,"So, that's obviously not right."
00:14:07,00:14:11,"So a yule hole is, I saw this from Susie Dent on Twitter."
00:14:11,00:14:14,It's a term for the loosest notch on your belt
00:14:14,00:14:17,reserved for Christmas feasting so that when you put
00:14:17,00:14:21,"a bit of extra on, you can use the yule hole in your belt."
00:14:21,00:14:22,That's great.
00:14:22,00:14:23,Ass holes.
00:14:23,00:14:24,Come on.
00:14:24,00:14:25,What are those?
00:14:25,00:14:29,"Donkey, donkey holes in the holes for donkeys."
00:14:29,00:14:30,Yeah.
00:14:30,00:14:31,It's donkey holes.
00:14:31,00:14:32,That's amazing.
00:14:32,00:14:35,It's not a donkey's asshole.
00:14:35,00:14:36,It's not an ass asshole.
00:14:36,00:14:38,It is out in the desert areas.
00:14:38,00:14:41,Donkeys make holes that create desert streams
00:14:41,00:14:43,and they provide water holes.
00:14:43,00:14:44,They're not called ass holes.
00:14:44,00:14:45,They are called ass holes.
00:14:45,00:14:47,This was in a scientific paper that I read.
00:14:47,00:14:48,Wow.
00:14:48,00:14:49,Scientific paper.
00:14:49,00:14:50,Come on.
00:14:50,00:14:51,Yeah.
00:14:51,00:14:53,It's a remarkable thing because not only does it feed
00:14:53,00:14:55,"the donkeys, the horses and their predators,"
00:14:55,00:14:58,up to 57 other species go and sip from these ass holes.
00:14:58,00:15:00,"But then when they dry up, they become nurseries"
00:15:00,00:15:01,for germination.
00:15:01,00:15:02,No.
00:15:02,00:15:11,You're not sending your kid to the asshole nursery.
00:15:11,00:15:13,And it's time for fact number two.
00:15:13,00:15:14,That is Andy.
00:15:14,00:15:17,"My fact is that during the Hundred Years' War,"
00:15:17,00:15:20,every goose in England had to donate six feathers
00:15:20,00:15:23,to the war effort.
00:15:23,00:15:26,"So, Hundred Years' War, England, France."
00:15:26,00:15:27,Very exciting.
00:15:27,00:15:34,"I mean, as far as wars go, it was a long one."
00:15:34,00:15:36,Long periods of inactivity.
00:15:36,00:15:37,Yeah.
00:15:37,00:15:38,Hundred and sixteen years.
00:15:38,00:15:39,Mostly dull.
00:15:39,00:15:41,"But during the hot bits of the war,"
00:15:41,00:15:44,England needed enormous numbers of goose feathers
00:15:44,00:15:47,because they needed enormous numbers of arrows.
00:15:47,00:15:51,"So, obviously, English Army mostly archer-based at the time,"
00:15:51,00:15:54,"like at Agincourt, 80% of the troops there were archers."
00:15:54,00:15:58,"And, you know, in 1421, the government had to buy half a million arrows."
00:15:58,00:16:02,And all of them needed goose feathers to put at the blunt end
00:16:02,00:16:06,to help the arrows fly through the air
00:16:06,00:16:08,"and hopefully, like, ooh, a Frenchman."
00:16:08,00:16:10,"So, that was the whole name of the game."
00:16:10,00:16:11,And where are the geese?
00:16:11,00:16:13,"You know, what a nightmare to organise."
00:16:13,00:16:15,"But fortunately, pretty much every village in England"
00:16:15,00:16:18,had a flock of geese just hanging around the village pond.
00:16:18,00:16:22,"And in 1417, King Henry V ordered that his sheriffs take six feathers"
00:16:22,00:16:25,from every goose of the land and deliver them to the Tower of London.
00:16:25,00:16:27,"So, this was a way that..."
00:16:27,00:16:31,"So, did they send all those sheriffs out to all the towns just plucking cubs?"
00:16:31,00:16:32,I guess the sheriffs were...
00:16:32,00:16:35,"Yeah, they might have sent under sheriffs or whatever."
00:16:35,00:16:37,But it was a huge endeavour.
00:16:37,00:16:40,"And, you know, like, Battle of Cressy, 1436..."
00:16:40,00:16:42,"Oh, 1346, sorry, so way earlier than this."
00:16:42,00:16:45,But the English archers on the day fired half a million arrows in one day.
00:16:45,00:16:46,80 per archer.
00:16:46,00:16:47,It's a lot.
00:16:47,00:16:48,It's so many feathers.
00:16:48,00:16:50,"Yeah, they've got orders of, like, a million feathers"
00:16:50,00:16:52,"from, like, one area of England that they need."
00:16:52,00:16:54,"I mean, because also, when you're building an arrow,"
00:16:54,00:16:56,"it's not just the feathers, obviously."
00:16:56,00:16:59,You need the wood in order to make the stick bit
00:16:59,00:17:01,between the plunt and the sharp bits.
00:17:01,00:17:02,You need...
00:17:02,00:17:03,That's vital.
00:17:03,00:17:06,"Yeah, and by the way, there was someone who was designated"
00:17:06,00:17:09,the official gatherer of all the sticks that sat in the arrow.
00:17:09,00:17:10,What?
00:17:10,00:17:11,"Yeah, yeah."
00:17:11,00:17:15,He was given the ability to just walk into any forest in the UK
00:17:15,00:17:16,and commandeer it.
00:17:16,00:17:17,No.
00:17:17,00:17:18,I'm commandeering your forest.
00:17:18,00:17:20,"Oh, I thought you meant he was given the right to look"
00:17:20,00:17:22,for good-looking sticks on the ground.
00:17:22,00:17:23,That one's fantastic.
00:17:23,00:17:26,I think his job meant he could go anywhere in the UK
00:17:26,00:17:29,"and point at a stick, and it was that stick that was now his."
00:17:29,00:17:32,Did they not just get bigger bits of wood and whittle them down?
00:17:32,00:17:33,"Yeah, yeah."
00:17:33,00:17:35,Because they just have to look for exactly the right stick.
00:17:35,00:17:36,"No, no, no."
00:17:36,00:17:38,"He could chop down trees, and he could do whatever he wanted."
00:17:38,00:17:39,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:17:39,00:17:40,That's very cool.
00:17:40,00:17:41,That's very cool.
00:17:41,00:17:44,"Yeah, because they also needed the wood for the bows as well, didn't they?"
00:17:44,00:17:49,"And it was illegal, actually, to make clogs out of ash for that time."
00:17:49,00:17:52,"You weren't allowed to make wooden shoes, because they needed it for the bows."
00:17:52,00:17:53,"Oh, really?"
00:17:53,00:17:56,"Presumably, at the time, it was one of the most fun things you could do"
00:17:56,00:17:58,"was make some clogs out of ash, so that was a sacrifice."
00:17:58,00:18:00,It's a different time.
00:18:00,00:18:03,"I think this is a good theory that, basically, geese were way more important"
00:18:03,00:18:06,"to the war effort than, for example, horses."
00:18:06,00:18:10,"If you didn't have horses, you know, like a war."
00:18:10,00:18:14,"Let me ask you, who is collecting the sticks for the arrows?"
00:18:14,00:18:17,"Really, it's that guy's dog, isn't it?"
00:18:17,00:18:22,"So surely that's where dogs collecting sticks came from, the origin."
00:18:22,00:18:23,It may be.
00:18:23,00:18:24,It's a team effort.
00:18:24,00:18:27,"Well, they had to get the arrows to the battlefield as well."
00:18:27,00:18:28,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:18:28,00:18:30,So they were often taken by horses.
00:18:30,00:18:33,"They would have huge wagons there, because each archer could shoot"
00:18:33,00:18:36,for about five minutes or so with the arrows that they had.
00:18:36,00:18:38,"And then they had to get more arrows,"
00:18:38,00:18:40,"because you can't just bring them all to the front, right?"
00:18:40,00:18:43,"And so there was a wagon there, and they always had, like,"
00:18:43,00:18:46,"a battalion of young boys who would run to the wagon,"
00:18:46,00:18:49,"grab the arrows, and run to the front to give the arrows to the archers."
00:18:49,00:18:51,That's a cool job to have.
00:18:51,00:18:54,Would you bring emergency geese with you on the battlefield?
00:18:54,00:18:55,"Oh, almost."
00:18:55,00:18:58,Certainly every archer would have two or three geese just in his back pocket.
00:18:58,00:19:01,"You're saying that, like, you're joking."
00:19:01,00:19:03,"No, I don't think you would."
00:19:03,00:19:06,"But surely when you run out of arrows and you need to emergency make a new one,"
00:19:06,00:19:09,I think the process of making an arrow is so time consuming.
00:19:09,00:19:13,"It's like saying, would you have a bullet maker on the battlefield"
00:19:13,00:19:15,in case you ran out of arrows?
00:19:15,00:19:17,"Yeah, once you ran out of arrows, that's the end of the battle."
00:19:17,00:19:18,You just go home.
00:19:18,00:19:21,"Well, I guess you go collect them, right? If they've worked."
00:19:21,00:19:24,"It's not like darts, where once they're in the board,"
00:19:24,00:19:26,then you pop over and you pluck them out.
00:19:26,00:19:30,"Stop them all, everyone, just collect the arrows, and then we'll do it again."
00:19:30,00:19:33,Do we know how pedantic they were about the goose feathers?
00:19:33,00:19:40,Because I read that traditionally it had to be feathers from the male goose
00:19:40,00:19:42,that were on the outside of the arrow.
00:19:42,00:19:45,And then the two stabilizing feathers had to be from the female.
00:19:45,00:19:48,"And I think there was a rumour that this made it fly better,"
00:19:48,00:19:50,but I think it was irrelevant. That was just the tradition.
00:19:50,00:19:51,And I'm not sure you could tell.
00:19:51,00:19:54,So I wonder how pedantic Mr. Sheriff was.
00:19:54,00:19:57,I imagine at the start of the war they were quite pedantic.
00:19:57,00:20:01,"And by year 115, they were probably like any old feather will do."
00:20:01,00:20:05,"Because actually I think it was, most people did use goose feathers,"
00:20:05,00:20:09,"but if you were really fashionable, you might use a peacock feather in your arm."
00:20:09,00:20:11,"That is classy, isn't it?"
00:20:11,00:20:13,You know you've been shot by an aristocrat.
00:20:13,00:20:16,"When you look there, you see a peacock feather sticking out of you."
00:20:16,00:20:18,"Oh, fancy."
00:20:18,00:20:23,Was this the kind of the final last hurrah for the goose war effort?
00:20:23,00:20:27,"Yeah, it probably was the last big effort."
00:20:27,00:20:29,Major time where it was like the dominating thing.
00:20:29,00:20:33,"Because they were starting to bring in right at the end, at about 1430,"
00:20:33,00:20:36,there were battles going on where cannons were starting to be used.
00:20:36,00:20:39,"But it was quite funny reading the accounts, because they were quite shit back then."
00:20:39,00:20:45,So there was a battle where the Duke of Burgundy fired 412 cannonballs into a town
00:20:45,00:20:50,and only succeeded in killing one chicken.
00:20:50,00:20:53,"Quick, get all the feathers!"
00:20:53,00:20:58,I think goose feathers were used a bit later for fuses.
00:20:58,00:21:04,"Because the hard bit of the feather is hollow,"
00:21:04,00:21:09,you could kind of stick it in and put gunpowder in it and set fire to it and then run away.
00:21:09,00:21:10,That's nice.
00:21:10,00:21:11,Pretty sure that was true.
00:21:11,00:21:14,"Oh, that's nice that they sort of stayed useful, that's lovely."
00:21:14,00:21:18,Because geese are big players in the world of human history.
00:21:18,00:21:19,"Oh, yeah."
00:21:19,00:21:25,Everything that was written between about 600 and 1800 AD.
00:21:25,00:21:26,It was done by a goose.
00:21:26,00:21:29,"Yes, a very patient goose."
00:21:29,00:21:33,"No, but the quills that we used to write, they were pretty much all goose."
00:21:33,00:21:35,You could use a peacock or a swan or whatever.
00:21:35,00:21:40,But isn't it crazy as well that you can get left-handed and right-handed quills
00:21:40,00:21:43,based on which wing you took the quill off?
00:21:43,00:21:49,"Yeah, it's much nicer if you're left-handed to use a right wing of a goose and vice versa,"
00:21:49,00:21:51,because of the way that it curves.
00:21:51,00:21:56,"But I hadn't realised that the reason the demand was so huge was that they didn't last very long at all,"
00:21:56,00:21:59,"because I guess you're shuffling them all the time, so you're lucky if your quill lasts a week."
00:21:59,00:22:04,"If you're having a big letter, if it's someone's birthday, then your quill's going to last a couple of days."
00:22:04,00:22:06,"Actually, I suppose you only write one birthday card, don't you?"
00:22:06,00:22:08,"Yeah, it's Christmas."
00:22:08,00:22:11,"It's Christmas, thank you. It's Jesus' birthday."
00:22:11,00:22:17,"But where we get penknife from, the word penknife, it's a knife to make a pen from a feather,"
00:22:17,00:22:19,"which I had never, I'd just never made that kind of thought."
00:22:19,00:22:20,"Oh, yeah."
00:22:20,00:22:22,I think the word pen might come from feather.
00:22:22,00:22:24,"It certainly does, penna."
00:22:24,00:22:29,"One of my favourite etymologies, pen and pencil, come from completely different routes,"
00:22:29,00:22:33,"because yeah, penna comes from feather, going back to Latin,"
00:22:33,00:22:39,"whereas pencil comes through Old French from, I think a word that means little penis."
00:22:39,00:22:41,I think you're right.
00:22:41,00:22:42,Really? Okay.
00:22:42,00:22:43,Yeah.
00:22:43,00:22:44,That is good.
00:22:44,00:22:45,Totally different etymologies.
00:22:45,00:22:47,My favourite is that assholes comes from the...
00:22:47,00:22:48,No.
00:22:48,00:22:52,"My favourite is, does anyone know why ducks are called ducks?"
00:22:52,00:22:53,It's because they duck.
00:22:53,00:22:54,I only learned this the other day.
00:22:54,00:22:55,That's absolutely incredible.
00:22:55,00:23:01,"It's like, because they duck under water, everyone was like, oh, duck, duck, duck, duck, and it's duck."
00:23:01,00:23:04,So humans were ducking sort of before ducks were ducking?
00:23:04,00:23:06,"The words, as in the words, yeah."
00:23:06,00:23:08,"I mean, ducks were ducking from..."
00:23:08,00:23:09,"Oh, yeah, of course, yeah."
00:23:09,00:23:10,What did we call them before? Just nothing.
00:23:10,00:23:12,"We're just like, I can't even acknowledge that."
00:23:12,00:23:13,And there was a few different...
00:23:13,00:23:16,"One thing we used to call them assfeeds, didn't we, ducks?"
00:23:16,00:23:17,Did we?
00:23:17,00:23:20,"Yeah, because they're always flapping their feet underneath their ass."
00:23:20,00:23:24,"Oh, because when they're ducking, they've also got their bum sticking out of the water."
00:23:24,00:23:25,"Yeah, yeah, anyway."
00:23:25,00:23:26,"Oh, yeah."
00:23:26,00:23:28,"But we're not talking about ducks, we're talking about geese."
00:23:28,00:23:29,Let's talk about golf.
00:23:29,00:23:32,"Let's talk about golf, because goose feathers were used in golf balls."
00:23:32,00:23:33,"Oh, really?"
00:23:33,00:23:35,"For a long time, actually."
00:23:35,00:23:40,"And that was kind of what kept posh people playing golf and non-posh people not playing golf,"
00:23:40,00:23:42,because they were so expensive.
00:23:42,00:23:47,"And the balls were so expensive, they were even more expensive than the clubs in those days."
00:23:47,00:23:48,Okay.
00:23:48,00:23:51,"And the way you would do it is you would get a load of goose feathers,"
00:23:51,00:23:54,"and you would put it in some cow hide or something,"
00:23:54,00:23:56,and then you would soak it all.
00:23:56,00:24:01,"And that made the leather get smaller, but it would make the goose's feathers get bigger."
00:24:01,00:24:04,"And that kind of made a really, really solid ball."
00:24:04,00:24:06,And it was a perfect ball for playing golf.
00:24:06,00:24:08,Did they bounce those ones?
00:24:08,00:24:10,You don't really need your golf ball to bounce.
00:24:10,00:24:11,Okay.
00:24:11,00:24:12,They didn't bounce as much.
00:24:12,00:24:15,You're thinking of basketballs.
00:24:15,00:24:17,"Oh, no."
00:24:17,00:24:20,"But when you were making these golf balls,"
00:24:20,00:24:24,every golf ball had a top hat full of feathers in it.
00:24:24,00:24:27,"That was how you would measure how many feathers you needed to get a top hat,"
00:24:27,00:24:29,"fill it with feathers, and that was the right amount."
00:24:29,00:24:31,So they're really shrinking down.
00:24:31,00:24:32,"Oh, yeah."
00:24:32,00:24:33,Very whimsical.
00:24:33,00:24:34,Wow.
00:24:34,00:24:36,I've got a riddle for you.
00:24:36,00:24:42,"""The USA hoarded 1.5 million pounds of goose feathers in a strategic reserve."""
00:24:42,00:24:43,Why?
00:24:43,00:24:44,Pillow fights?
00:24:44,00:24:45,No.
00:24:45,00:24:46,No.
00:24:46,00:24:47,Okay.
00:24:47,00:24:48,They say it again.
00:24:48,00:24:51,"They had it all in one, like, building."
00:24:51,00:24:54,"Well, I don't know about the exact administrative distribution"
00:24:54,00:24:57,of the 1.5 million pounds of goose feathers.
00:24:57,00:25:00,They might have needed a few sheds or whatever.
00:25:00,00:25:01,A hole?
00:25:01,00:25:02,Could have been in an asshole.
00:25:02,00:25:07,"No, we're not making asshole a thing, it's not happening."
00:25:07,00:25:08,Why?
00:25:08,00:25:09,Why?
00:25:09,00:25:10,I'm trying to set a guess.
00:25:10,00:25:12,Is this for when we go back to the olden days
00:25:12,00:25:13,and we have to rely on bow and arrows
00:25:13,00:25:16,because the nuclear blast has wiped out our guns?
00:25:16,00:25:17,Nice guess.
00:25:17,00:25:21,It's actually for if we need to go somewhere cold.
00:25:21,00:25:22,It's just to make down...
00:25:22,00:25:23,To make two bags.
00:25:23,00:25:25,"To fill, it's basically sleeping bags"
00:25:25,00:25:27,and boots and Arctic weather kit.
00:25:27,00:25:30,It's if suddenly we need to fight in the Arctic.
00:25:30,00:25:32,So you just have the strategic reserves in case...
00:25:32,00:25:34,"So when James said pillow, he was right."
00:25:34,00:25:35,"No, no."
00:25:35,00:25:36,He said James said pillow fights.
00:25:36,00:25:37,Completely different thing.
00:25:37,00:25:39,Frivolous in times of war.
00:25:39,00:25:40,Well...
00:25:40,00:25:42,"Well, that's interesting."
00:25:42,00:25:43,"Anyway, just that was part of the..."
00:25:43,00:25:45,And are they not there anymore?
00:25:45,00:25:47,So is it worth attacking Alaska is what I'm asking.
00:25:47,00:25:49,Certainly is.
00:25:49,00:25:51,"Guys, I need to move us on."
00:25:51,00:25:53,Do you want to sneak in anything before we...
00:25:53,00:25:55,Another use for a goose.
00:25:55,00:25:56,I'm sure you guys know this.
00:25:56,00:25:59,"But Rabalé wrote in Gargantua,"
00:25:59,00:26:02,"""I wiped my arse with a hen, with a cock,"
00:26:02,00:26:04,"""with a calfskin, with a..."""
00:26:04,00:26:05,Come on.
00:26:05,00:26:08,"""With a hair, with a pigeon, with a cormorant,"
00:26:08,00:26:10,"""with Naterni's bag..."""
00:26:10,00:26:11,What's Naterni's bag?
00:26:11,00:26:13,"""But of all the tortures, arse wisps,"
00:26:13,00:26:17,"""bumfodders, tail napkins, bunkhole cleansers,"
00:26:17,00:26:22,"""there is none in the world comparable to the neck of a goose."""
00:26:22,00:26:24,How big of a vindaloo are this guy's hats?
00:26:24,00:26:25,They took all of that.
00:26:25,00:26:27,"Oh, goose."
00:26:27,00:26:35,"All right, we are going to move on to fact number three."
00:26:35,00:26:38,"It is time for fact number three, and that is my fact."
00:26:38,00:26:43,My fact this week is that American comedian Lucille Ball's teeth
00:26:43,00:26:48,could play the latest pop songs and bust Japanese spies.
00:26:48,00:26:49,Wow.
00:26:49,00:26:52,"If you were around Lucille Ball at the right moment,"
00:26:52,00:26:56,"if you stuck your ear to her mouth, you could hear..."
00:26:56,00:26:58,You could hear the latest pop songs.
00:26:58,00:27:00,So stupid.
00:27:00,00:27:01,But it's true.
00:27:01,00:27:03,Was she singing them?
00:27:03,00:27:04,She wasn't singing them.
00:27:04,00:27:06,"No, it was legit the pop song."
00:27:06,00:27:09,"So 1952, she was filming a movie."
00:27:09,00:27:12,"""Dubare"" was a lady with Red Skelton."
00:27:12,00:27:14,"This was during World War II,"
00:27:14,00:27:17,and she had recently just had some temporary lead fillings
00:27:17,00:27:21,"put into her teeth, and as she drove home from the MGM studio,"
00:27:21,00:27:25,"she said, ""One night I came into the valley and I heard music."
00:27:25,00:27:28,"I reached down and turned the radio off, and it wasn't on."
00:27:28,00:27:30,"The music kept getting louder and louder,"
00:27:30,00:27:33,and then I realized it was coming from my mouth.
00:27:33,00:27:35,I even recognized the tune.
00:27:35,00:27:38,"My mouth was humming and thumping with drumbeats,"
00:27:38,00:27:40,and I thought I was losing my mind.
00:27:40,00:27:41,"I thought, ""What the hell is this?"""
00:27:41,00:27:43,Then it started to subside.
00:27:43,00:27:44,"I got home, went to bed,"
00:27:44,00:27:46,not sure if I should tell anyone what happened
00:27:46,00:27:48,because they would think I was crazy.
00:27:48,00:27:51,"Anyway, she told this to Buster Keaton, the comedian,"
00:27:51,00:27:52,"who she was good friends with,"
00:27:52,00:27:55,and he said that she was picking up on radio broadcasts
00:27:55,00:27:56,"through her fillings,"
00:27:56,00:27:58,"and that the same thing had happened to a friend of his,"
00:27:58,00:28:01,"and a lot of people were reporting this at the time,"
00:28:01,00:28:03,"and then she suddenly heard, coming through her teeth,"
00:28:03,00:28:13,"and she reported it to someone, and that person said,"
00:28:13,00:28:17,"""That could be Japanese spies who were trying to send water reach."""
00:28:17,00:28:22,It could have been just the start of Inspector Moss.
00:28:22,00:28:25,Your lead fillings get radioed.
00:28:25,00:28:27,"You need some metal in there,"
00:28:27,00:28:29,"which is going to receive the radio waves,"
00:28:29,00:28:31,and then you need something in there
00:28:31,00:28:33,"that's not quite solid that can vibrate,"
00:28:33,00:28:35,and the radio waves will make that vibrate
00:28:35,00:28:37,and will make the sound come through.
00:28:37,00:28:39,Because it has happened in history.
00:28:39,00:28:42,"There's an example in the American Journal of Psychiatry,"
00:28:42,00:28:45,"where a 35-year-old war veteran thought he was hearing voices,"
00:28:45,00:28:49,but it turned out he was getting a local radio station.
00:28:49,00:28:53,"There was a 65-year-old man who had hip replacements,"
00:28:53,00:28:56,"and the doctor was checking his feet,"
00:28:56,00:28:59,and so put his stethoscope to his feet
00:28:59,00:29:02,and could hear Taylor Swift or whatever it was.
00:29:02,00:29:05,It was vibrating through his hip replacements.
00:29:05,00:29:07,That's brilliant.
00:29:07,00:29:09,"Has it ever been loud enough that if you're like,"
00:29:09,00:29:11,"""Oh, I can't quite get the signal for a glass of FM,"""
00:29:11,00:29:13,"you can say, ""Let's go round to Barry's house."""
00:29:13,00:29:15,Gather around and grant her a tip.
00:29:15,00:29:17,That's really funny.
00:29:17,00:29:20,"This is a field of study at the moment,"
00:29:20,00:29:23,"so the US Army has just got the molar mic, Raphon,"
00:29:23,00:29:27,"which is a radio that clips onto your tooth, basically,"
00:29:27,00:29:31,and it transmits these signals through your jawbone.
00:29:31,00:29:33,So the sound goes into your jaw
00:29:33,00:29:35,and just goes straight to your auditory nerve.
00:29:35,00:29:37,So you can hear a big advantage.
00:29:37,00:29:39,You don't have to wear a microphone
00:29:39,00:29:41,"if you're up to your neck in a swamp or whatever,"
00:29:41,00:29:43,and they are testing us at the moment.
00:29:43,00:29:45,That's actually weirdly.
00:29:45,00:29:47,"We talked about Beethoven on last week's episode,"
00:29:47,00:29:49,and I don't think we mentioned that his friend designed for him
00:29:49,00:29:51,"something like that, didn't he?"
00:29:51,00:29:53,"When Beethoven went deaf, he designed a contraption"
00:29:53,00:29:55,that he put on his jaw against his jaw
00:29:55,00:29:57,that conducted sound for him
00:29:57,00:29:59,"so that he could hear better what he was playing,"
00:29:59,00:30:01,and it attached to his piano.
00:30:01,00:30:03,Didn't he have to bite his piano to hear it?
00:30:03,00:30:05,"I think he did have to bite down on the piano, yes."
00:30:05,00:30:07,"That was the prototype, him biting."
00:30:07,00:30:09,"And then his friend was like, ""I'll make you a straw, mate."""
00:30:09,00:30:11,"Yeah, and built like a metal rod."
00:30:11,00:30:13,Wow.
00:30:13,00:30:15,"Just so that in case anyone doesn't recognize the name Lucy O'Ball,"
00:30:15,00:30:17,"I'm talking about ""I Love Lucy,"""
00:30:17,00:30:19,one of the greatest comedians of all time.
00:30:19,00:30:21,"I mean, quite often voted the greatest"
00:30:21,00:30:23,American TV comedian of all time.
00:30:23,00:30:25,"""I Love Lucy"" was the sitcom that she made, right?"
00:30:25,00:30:27,"Yeah, yeah. She was incredible."
00:30:27,00:30:29,She's going to have her day very soon
00:30:29,00:30:31,where she gets that second wind of championation.
00:30:31,00:30:33,She actually died 30 years ago.
00:30:33,00:30:35,I don't know why Dan thinks she's going to get a second wind.
00:30:35,00:30:37,"No, I mean, I did like..."
00:30:37,00:30:39,Someone's going to say she's my favorite
00:30:39,00:30:41,and we're all going to watch her movies again and so on.
00:30:41,00:30:43,"Dan's new podcast, ""I Love Lucy."""
00:30:43,00:30:48,"Which is entirely in Morse code, only receivable by teeth."
00:30:48,00:30:50,I didn't realize how cute she was.
00:30:50,00:30:52,"So there was a thing of,"
00:30:52,00:30:54,"in one of the shows,"
00:30:54,00:30:56,her character gives birth.
00:30:56,00:30:58,And I think it was the first time
00:30:58,00:31:00,any American TV had shown
00:31:00,00:31:02,a pregnant woman going to hospital
00:31:02,00:31:04,as a character.
00:31:04,00:31:06,44 million people watched that.
00:31:06,00:31:08,"Yeah, it's insane."
00:31:08,00:31:10,"Stunning, crazy numbers."
00:31:10,00:31:12,72% of American homes.
00:31:12,00:31:14,America used to shut down on a Monday night
00:31:14,00:31:16,because that was the night it was broadcast.
00:31:16,00:31:18,"And weirdly, in that episode,"
00:31:18,00:31:20,she gave birth the same night that her character
00:31:20,00:31:22,gave birth on TV.
00:31:22,00:31:24,Not that weirdly because she booked
00:31:24,00:31:26,in a caesarean for that day.
00:31:26,00:31:28,Yeah.
00:31:28,00:31:30,"So ""I Love Lucy"" was possibly"
00:31:30,00:31:32,the first major TV comedy
00:31:32,00:31:34,that was pre-recorded.
00:31:34,00:31:36,"Up until then, you were doing live TV,"
00:31:36,00:31:38,everything went out live.
00:31:38,00:31:40,"And she and her husband, Desi,"
00:31:40,00:31:42,they innovated the multi-camera
00:31:42,00:31:44,live audience pre-record.
00:31:44,00:31:46,"So when that show did go out,"
00:31:46,00:31:48,it was timed so that she would give birth
00:31:48,00:31:50,on the same night.
00:31:50,00:31:52,"But what's amazing as well is Andy,"
00:31:52,00:31:54,not only was it the first time they saw someone
00:31:54,00:31:56,"going to deliver a baby,"
00:31:56,00:31:58,"but they couldn't even use the word ""pregnancy"""
00:31:58,00:32:00,on the show.
00:32:00,00:32:02,"So the episode wasn't called ""Lucy is Pregnant"","
00:32:02,00:32:04,"it was called ""Lucy is Enciente"""
00:32:04,00:32:06,because that's a...
00:32:06,00:32:08,What's that?
00:32:08,00:32:10,"Well, it's a different word for pregnant."
00:32:10,00:32:12,I forgot to write which language down.
00:32:12,00:32:14,I assume it'll be Spanish because
00:32:14,00:32:16,it's Cuban.
00:32:16,00:32:18,And I think whenever they refer
00:32:18,00:32:20,"to pregnancy, they would say she was expecting."
00:32:20,00:32:22,They would never say she was pregnant.
00:32:22,00:32:24,"It's mad, it's like it was a swear word."
00:32:24,00:32:26,It's absolutely bizarre. Did no one know
00:32:26,00:32:28,about pregnancy then?
00:32:28,00:32:30,"Actually, one of the facts that someone"
00:32:30,00:32:32,in the audience sent to us today
00:32:32,00:32:34,said something like...
00:32:34,00:32:36,I think it was 1974
00:32:36,00:32:38,and it was the formula one.
00:32:38,00:32:40,And they refused to show it on the BBC
00:32:40,00:32:42,because one of the teams was sponsored
00:32:42,00:32:44,and all the other teams were sponsored
00:32:44,00:32:46,by cigarette brands.
00:32:46,00:32:48,"And they were like, ""No, no, condoms."
00:32:48,00:32:50,"Definitely can't have that on our TV."""
00:32:50,00:32:52,"Yeah, and when they did"
00:32:52,00:32:54,"the pregnancy announcement script as well,"
00:32:54,00:32:56,"they had to, because in"
00:32:56,00:32:58,"TV land, often you have to give it"
00:32:58,00:33:00,to people who are looking to see if there's anything
00:33:00,00:33:02,that can be offensive. So the BBC have...
00:33:02,00:33:04,"James, what's it called when they have to have a pass"
00:33:04,00:33:06,through it to make sure it's okay?
00:33:06,00:33:08,Spoilspot.
00:33:08,00:33:10,"Yeah, that basically."
00:33:10,00:33:12,Compliance. The compliance was not only done
00:33:12,00:33:14,"by someone who was in-house, part of the network,"
00:33:14,00:33:16,"but it had to be handed to a priest, a rabbi."
00:33:16,00:33:18,No. And they themselves
00:33:18,00:33:20,are a joke as well.
00:33:20,00:33:24,"Look, we're all going with the big question about Lucy."
00:33:24,00:33:26,"Lucille, was she a communist?"
00:33:26,00:33:28,Oh. She was accused of being a communist.
00:33:28,00:33:30,"Was she? Yeah, and she was registered to vote"
00:33:30,00:33:32,"as a communist. Oh, so that says"
00:33:32,00:33:34,"she's a communist. Yeah, it does."
00:33:34,00:33:36,"People claimed, people said they went to her house"
00:33:36,00:33:38,"to have communist meetings, didn't they?"
00:33:38,00:33:40,But she did insist that she wasn't a communist.
00:33:40,00:33:42,She said she was basically hauled
00:33:42,00:33:44,over the coals in 1952 by the McCarthyite
00:33:44,00:33:46,when the sort of commie
00:33:46,00:33:48,hunting fever was at its absolute height.
00:33:48,00:33:50,"And, you know, she gave evidence, she said,"
00:33:50,00:33:52,"""Yes, I was registered to vote as a communist"
00:33:52,00:33:54,"in the '30s, but it was only to please"
00:33:54,00:33:56,"my elderly grandfather."" Very good."
00:33:56,00:33:58,Exclusive Stalin.
00:33:58,00:34:04,I love Lenin.
00:34:06,00:34:08,"There was a movie about Lucille Ball, wasn't there"
00:34:08,00:34:10,"quite recently, and there's a big scene in that"
00:34:10,00:34:12,where her husband
00:34:12,00:34:14,comes out in front of the audience
00:34:14,00:34:16,and says she's not a communist.
00:34:16,00:34:18,"And he said, ""The only thing"
00:34:18,00:34:20,"read about Lucy is her hair,"
00:34:20,00:34:22,"and even that's not legitimate."""
00:34:22,00:34:24,That's very good. Very good.
00:34:24,00:34:26,"It was an amazing relationship, must have been quite,"
00:34:26,00:34:28,"I don't know, we all get excited"
00:34:28,00:34:30,"by celebrity relationships. Well, I don't,"
00:34:30,00:34:32,"because I'm above it, but many do."
00:34:32,00:34:34,They were one of the originals.
00:34:34,00:34:36,Desi Arnaz was her husband. They'd been together
00:34:36,00:34:38,"for ten years when they made ""I Love Lucy,"""
00:34:38,00:34:40,and they played husband and wife in that.
00:34:40,00:34:42,"They sort of played versions of their own characters, didn't they?"
00:34:42,00:34:44,"And it must have been quite groundbreaking then,"
00:34:44,00:34:46,"because he was a Cuban migrant,"
00:34:46,00:34:48,"and she was this ginger person,"
00:34:48,00:34:50,the TV station said at the time...
00:34:50,00:34:52,It's hardly been seen on TV before.
00:34:52,00:34:54,A Cuban and a ginger.
00:34:54,00:34:56,They had to call her
00:34:56,00:34:58,"Strawberry Blond, didn't they?"
00:34:58,00:35:00,I remember TV was black
00:35:00,00:35:02,and white back then as well.
00:35:02,00:35:04,"It's more the fact she was white, isn't it?"
00:35:04,00:35:06,"No, they kept on quoting,"
00:35:06,00:35:09,"""No one's going to believe that a pale redhead"
00:35:09,00:35:11,"""is going to go out with a Cuban."""
00:35:11,00:35:13,"Maybe it was like, ""Is she dark hair?"""
00:35:13,00:35:15,"You know, maybe it's slightly more plausible."
00:35:15,00:35:17,"Anyway, there was lots of fuss about it,"
00:35:17,00:35:19,"but they were an amazing relationship,"
00:35:19,00:35:21,"and they did divorce, but they stayed very good friends."
00:35:21,00:35:23,"But he was interesting as well, Desi Arnaz,"
00:35:23,00:35:25,and he gave us the conga.
00:35:25,00:35:27,Did he?
00:35:27,00:35:29,What do you mean he gave it to us?
00:35:29,00:35:31,He basically introduced the conga line
00:35:31,00:35:33,to the West.
00:35:33,00:35:36,"He started, and then another person got behind him"
00:35:36,00:35:39,"before he knew it, the entire population of America."
00:35:39,00:35:42,"Yeah, yeah, America came to a standstill for years."
00:35:42,00:35:44,"That is a big one, isn't it?"
00:35:44,00:35:46,"It's a big one, and that's obviously not how it started,"
00:35:46,00:35:48,"but it was a big thing in Cuba,"
00:35:48,00:35:51,so Cubans in America tended to know about it.
00:35:51,00:35:54,"His father had been mayor of Santiago de Cuba in the '20s,"
00:35:54,00:35:58,and actually his father had repeatedly tried to ban the conga
00:35:58,00:36:01,for being immoral and dangerous and sexy.
00:36:01,00:36:02,Which it is.
00:36:02,00:36:04,Which it is!
00:36:04,00:36:06,But he then set up a club.
00:36:06,00:36:08,It's the sexiest dance I know.
00:36:08,00:36:10,I don't know about you guys.
00:36:10,00:36:12,"It depends where the conga goes into, isn't it?"
00:36:12,00:36:14,"Yeah, I don't know."
00:36:14,00:36:16,It doesn't go into anything!
00:36:16,00:36:18,Do you mean which room it goes into?
00:36:18,00:36:20,"If you keep it in the kitchen, it's not sexy."
00:36:20,00:36:22,If it goes into the sex dungeon...
00:36:22,00:36:27,I think a conga makes a sex dungeon unsexy
00:36:27,00:36:29,rather than the other way round.
00:36:29,00:36:32,"Oh, man, I'd be so terrified if I was halfway along the conga,"
00:36:32,00:36:34,and I saw them going into the sex dungeon.
00:36:34,00:36:37,You can't change the course of the conga.
00:36:37,00:36:39,You can't do it.
00:36:39,00:36:43,"We just start walking quicker, so we get through the sex dungeon faster,"
00:36:43,00:36:46,and hopefully back out into the billiard's room or something normal.
00:36:46,00:36:49,Are you ever allowed to jump in front of a conga to avert crisis?
00:36:49,00:36:51,You're not allowed to speed...
00:36:51,00:36:53,"No, but you can exert subtle pressure from behind."
00:36:53,00:36:55,"Like, let's crack on."
00:36:55,00:36:57,Can we just...
00:36:57,00:36:59,Pressure from behind is what they want.
00:36:59,00:37:01,"Oh, no!"
00:37:01,00:37:03,I started the sex dungeon party!
00:37:03,00:37:05,"Oh, no!"
00:37:05,00:37:07,Anyway...
00:37:07,00:37:10,Are we talking about Lucille Ball?
00:37:10,00:37:12,He started a club.
00:37:12,00:37:15,"He started making clear a club called the conga,"
00:37:15,00:37:17,where he introduced conga dancing.
00:37:17,00:37:20,"And that's how it came to us, so thank you."
00:37:20,00:37:22,"Thank you, Desi. Here's something we've got to thank,"
00:37:22,00:37:25,"largely Lucille, but also Desi for."
00:37:25,00:37:28,It is thanks to her that we have Star Trek.
00:37:28,00:37:31,Star Trek exists because of Lucille Ball.
00:37:31,00:37:34,"So, Jean Roddenbury had pitched the idea to quite a few productions."
00:37:34,00:37:37,"Jean Roddenbury being the founder/creator of Star Trek,"
00:37:37,00:37:39,and not many people wanted it.
00:37:39,00:37:41,Lucille said this sounds fantastic.
00:37:41,00:37:43,"There's a rumour that she misunderstood what it was,"
00:37:43,00:37:47,"because she thought it was celebrities going on treks, basically."
00:37:47,00:37:49,Star Trek.
00:37:49,00:37:52,It was at a time where Bob Hope was going with USO members
00:37:52,00:37:55,"to the war zones, and it was a big Star Power thing."
00:37:55,00:37:57,That's a great name for a show.
00:37:57,00:37:59,"Star Trek, right?"
00:37:59,00:38:01,"Star Trek's about to show, arguably."
00:38:01,00:38:03,But then she...
00:38:03,00:38:05,"She then found out what it was about,"
00:38:05,00:38:07,"and she said, ""This sounds very good."""
00:38:07,00:38:09,"They made a pilot that was rejected,"
00:38:09,00:38:11,"and she said, ""Let's give it another pilot."""
00:38:11,00:38:14,And it was the second pilot that allowed for Star Trek to be made.
00:38:14,00:38:16,"And she did that with Mission Impossible as well,"
00:38:16,00:38:18,and a number of other shows.
00:38:18,00:38:20,"The old one, which I actually didn't know was a thing."
00:38:20,00:38:21,Anna.
00:38:21,00:38:22,I'm so sorry!
00:38:22,00:38:24,It's like you don't listen to me at all!
00:38:24,00:38:25,(LAUGHTER)
00:38:25,00:38:27,"Yeah, the TV series, Mission Impossible."
00:38:27,00:38:28,Yeah.
00:38:28,00:38:29,Very good.
00:38:29,00:38:31,"Well, not only was she a nerd, she was a jerk."
00:38:31,00:38:32,"Yes, I heard that too."
00:38:32,00:38:33,Yes.
00:38:33,00:38:34,The soda jerk.
00:38:34,00:38:35,Oh.
00:38:35,00:38:38,I just heard she was an unpleasant person to work with.
00:38:38,00:38:39,"Yeah, yeah."
00:38:39,00:38:41,"Okay, in the 20s and the 50s, it was this huge phenomenon."
00:38:41,00:38:43,"I didn't know how big a deal it was,"
00:38:43,00:38:45,"so it was in drugstores, chemists, basically."
00:38:45,00:38:47,"But they had soda fountains there,"
00:38:47,00:38:49,"and you'd have the soda jerk working the soda fountain,"
00:38:49,00:38:51,called that because they jerk the handle
00:38:51,00:38:53,as they're giving it to you.
00:38:53,00:38:55,"But they weren't really, that wasn't their job."
00:38:55,00:38:57,Their main job was to be an entertainer.
00:38:57,00:39:00,"And they were all about punning, wordplay,"
00:39:00,00:39:03,making up crazy new terms for these drinks.
00:39:03,00:39:05,"You'd order, like, a cherry Coke,"
00:39:05,00:39:08,"and they'd shout, ""Stretch one, paint it red!"""
00:39:08,00:39:10,And that means they want a cherry Coke.
00:39:10,00:39:11,Wow.
00:39:11,00:39:13,Aren't they also the one making the drink?
00:39:13,00:39:14,No.
00:39:14,00:39:15,Who are they shouting this to?
00:39:15,00:39:17,"Yeah, I think there's another soda jerk behind them,"
00:39:17,00:39:19,who's doing a bit of the back and forth.
00:39:19,00:39:21,"Okay, okay, a bit of business."
00:39:21,00:39:23,You'd order a Mary Garden.
00:39:23,00:39:25,"Mary Garden was a famous singer,"
00:39:25,00:39:27,"and you ordered a Mary Garden because it made you sing,"
00:39:27,00:39:29,and that was the drink where you wanted them to spike it
00:39:29,00:39:31,with laxatives because you're blocked up
00:39:31,00:39:33,and you needed to have some diarrhea.
00:39:33,00:39:34,"Oh, my God!"
00:39:34,00:39:36,"That, you know what?"
00:39:36,00:39:38,"That sounds mad, but I do think that is missing"
00:39:38,00:39:40,"from modern cocktail bars, where..."
00:39:42,00:39:45,And if you could just pull off a couple of the old
00:39:45,00:39:47,"shit-a-roonies in there, that would be..."
00:39:47,00:39:54,"It is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:39:54,00:39:56,and that is James.
00:39:56,00:39:59,"Okay, my fact this week is that the smelliest car"
00:39:59,00:40:01,at the British Motor Museum
00:40:01,00:40:04,belongs to Queen Elizabeth II.
00:40:04,00:40:07,Are you allowed to make those sort of accusations?
00:40:07,00:40:09,"It's not an accusation, it's a fact."
00:40:09,00:40:11,"That's all we do on this show, we do facts."
00:40:11,00:40:13,What are some of us?
00:40:13,00:40:15,I'm...
00:40:15,00:40:17,I'm going to guess that it smelled of corgi.
00:40:17,00:40:19,"Oh, okay."
00:40:19,00:40:21,It just had constant corgis all the way through it.
00:40:21,00:40:24,"Okay, well, the people who smelled it..."
00:40:24,00:40:26,dealt it.
00:40:26,00:40:28,"No, the people who smelled it said,"
00:40:28,00:40:31,"""It's not a terribly nice smell, but it is very interesting."
00:40:31,00:40:34,"""It has an almost cheesy, fatty smell to it."""
00:40:34,00:40:37,"Ooh, is that Philip?"
00:40:40,00:40:43,"No, so let me just explain how we know this."
00:40:43,00:40:47,"So, there is a guy at York University called Dr. Will Tullet,"
00:40:47,00:40:49,and he's head of the British part
00:40:49,00:40:52,"of a European research programme into smell,"
00:40:52,00:40:54,and they're trying to find lots of old smells
00:40:54,00:40:56,and kind of save them before they disappear.
00:40:56,00:40:59,And they ask people what kind of smells are you worried
00:40:59,00:41:01,"are going to disappear, and a lot of people are worried"
00:41:01,00:41:04,"that the old smell of cars is going to disappear,"
00:41:04,00:41:06,"because now we're all going electric,"
00:41:06,00:41:08,"there's not going to be any petrol cars,"
00:41:08,00:41:11,"cars are going to change, the smell is going to change,"
00:41:11,00:41:15,we're going to miss those old cheesy smells of cars.
00:41:15,00:41:18,"And so they thought, well, we need to find the smell of an old car,"
00:41:18,00:41:19,so what should we do?
00:41:19,00:41:21,"We'll go to Gaydon in Warwickshire,"
00:41:21,00:41:23,"which is where the British Motor Museum is,"
00:41:23,00:41:26,"and we'll say, ""Where is your smelliest car, please?"""
00:41:26,00:41:28,"And they said, ""Well, without doubt,"
00:41:28,00:41:31,"""the smelliest one is this Rover from the 1970s"
00:41:31,00:41:32,"""that belonged to the Queen."""
00:41:32,00:41:35,"That's very interesting, because there's this thing about the Queen"
00:41:35,00:41:38,"that supposedly she thought the world smelled of fresh paint,"
00:41:38,00:41:41,"because everywhere she goes, it's just been painted fresh"
00:41:41,00:41:43,"for her arrival, so she just smells this all the time."
00:41:43,00:41:45,So it might have been a reaction to that.
00:41:45,00:41:47,"And also, this had a thick carpet added to it."
00:41:47,00:41:49,I presume for royal luxury.
00:41:49,00:41:50,That's absolutely right.
00:41:50,00:41:52,"It had a thick, curly pile carpet,"
00:41:52,00:41:56,"and it also had windows that were sealed,"
00:41:56,00:41:59,"in case there was a gas attack out there, they wouldn't go."
00:41:59,00:42:00,"Oh, so it keeps the smell in."
00:42:00,00:42:02,"Basically, the smell stayed in there"
00:42:02,00:42:04,because they got into the carpet and they stayed in there
00:42:04,00:42:07,and they couldn't escape because all the windows were sealed.
00:42:07,00:42:11,"So it could be some occupant just let off a huge fart,"
00:42:11,00:42:13,"shut the door straight away,"
00:42:13,00:42:15,"and it just hasn't been able to get out ever since,"
00:42:15,00:42:16,until these people enter.
00:42:16,00:42:18,I'm sure it was the Coggies that did that.
00:42:18,00:42:20,"But anyway, if you are interested,"
00:42:20,00:42:24,then in 2023 they produced some car fresheners
00:42:24,00:42:26,with the royal car smell.
00:42:26,00:42:27,Really?
00:42:27,00:42:29,So you can get a little tree in your car.
00:42:29,00:42:31,They'll give you the smell of the smelly Queen's car.
00:42:31,00:42:32,That's so good.
00:42:32,00:42:34,"I would just, while we're mentioning the modifications"
00:42:34,00:42:36,"that were made to her car,"
00:42:36,00:42:38,"we know that the presidential car, the beast,"
00:42:38,00:42:40,has things like it has blood in it
00:42:40,00:42:43,of the president in case there's an assassination
00:42:43,00:42:44,they need to administer abroad.
00:42:44,00:42:45,Really?
00:42:45,00:42:47,"Yeah, there's all sorts of modifications to the car."
00:42:47,00:42:49,"And I thought surely any time the Queen had a car,"
00:42:49,00:42:50,they pimped the car.
00:42:50,00:42:52,"So there's that, the windows."
00:42:52,00:42:55,"There's also, in between the two front seats,"
00:42:55,00:42:57,there was a little tray that pulled out
00:42:57,00:43:00,"that allowed her to put her handbag onto the tray,"
00:43:00,00:43:01,just in the middle of her.
00:43:01,00:43:02,Yeah.
00:43:02,00:43:03,"I just remembered, I've seen the Queen's car."
00:43:03,00:43:04,Oh yeah?
00:43:04,00:43:05,I walked past her once.
00:43:05,00:43:06,Was she in it?
00:43:06,00:43:07,No.
00:43:07,00:43:09,Were you in the Gaiden multi-museum?
00:43:09,00:43:10,"No, I wasn't."
00:43:10,00:43:13,"It was just, she was visiting the university I was at."
00:43:13,00:43:15,And were you blown away by the car smell?
00:43:15,00:43:17,Did you sort of have to cross the street?
00:43:17,00:43:18,"No, it wasn't a rover."
00:43:18,00:43:19,It was one of the posh cars.
00:43:19,00:43:20,"It was a sort of, I don't know, Bentley or something."
00:43:20,00:43:22,"But it was, but it has the special huge,"
00:43:22,00:43:25,you know how some cars have the little sticky upy Mercedes thing?
00:43:25,00:43:28,The Queen's car had a massive St. George
00:43:28,00:43:30,and the dragon silver thing on the bonnet.
00:43:30,00:43:31,Did you see it?
00:43:31,00:43:32,Yeah.
00:43:32,00:43:33,It was quite cool.
00:43:33,00:43:34,I think that was unique.
00:43:34,00:43:35,Yeah.
00:43:35,00:43:36,And does the King get any of this shit?
00:43:36,00:43:38,"Or is it just like, we've stopped caring?"
00:43:38,00:43:39,I think King does.
00:43:39,00:43:44,"Well, doesn't he use wine for petrol?"
00:43:44,00:43:45,Wine and cheese.
00:43:45,00:43:46,Wine and trees.
00:43:46,00:43:48,"Just general smells, of course."
00:43:48,00:43:51,"So the little pine tree thing that they put in cars,"
00:43:51,00:43:54,"like the classic car freshener, was debuted in 1952,"
00:43:54,00:43:57,"which is actually the year the Queen became the Queen, isn't it?"
00:43:57,00:43:59,"Oh yeah, she coronated in '53."
00:43:59,00:44:00,"But she did, yeah."
00:44:00,00:44:02,"Anyway, she didn't invent it."
00:44:02,00:44:06,But that was not initially in the shape of a Christmas tree
00:44:06,00:44:07,or a pine tree.
00:44:07,00:44:09,Do you know what it was originally in the shape of?
00:44:09,00:44:10,Oh.
00:44:10,00:44:11,Oh gosh.
00:44:11,00:44:12,Something smelly.
00:44:12,00:44:13,A candle.
00:44:13,00:44:14,No.
00:44:14,00:44:18,"It was, I'm afraid, a sexy, pin-up model woman."
00:44:18,00:44:19,Was it?
00:44:19,00:44:20,Was it?
00:44:20,00:44:21,Yeah.
00:44:21,00:44:22,"Was it with a big bottom, though, that could be farting?"
00:44:22,00:44:24,Because it was the era of those postcards on the beach.
00:44:24,00:44:26,"No, it wasn't invented in Bogner."
00:44:26,00:44:27,"No, it was in..."
00:44:27,00:44:32,"You know those World War II planes,"
00:44:32,00:44:34,and you'd paint a sexy woman on the side of your plane?
00:44:34,00:44:36,You know that kind of fetty boom?
00:44:36,00:44:37,Kind of pin-up.
00:44:37,00:44:38,"Yeah, the pin-up thing."
00:44:38,00:44:39,That was the shape of the first.
00:44:39,00:44:41,It was a chemist called Julius Semen.
00:44:41,00:44:42,Julius Semen?
00:44:42,00:44:44,"Yeah, say that surname again."
00:44:44,00:44:45,"Semen, it sort of finished."
00:44:45,00:44:46,He's got an accent I don't know how to pronounce.
00:44:46,00:44:48,"He bumped into a milkman recently who said,"
00:44:48,00:44:50,"""My truck smells of spilt milk all the time,"
00:44:50,00:44:51,and it's horrible.
00:44:51,00:44:52,It clings to the truck.
00:44:52,00:44:53,"Can you invent something?"""
00:44:53,00:44:56,"And he said, ""Yeah, I'll go and invent the pine-centred thing."""
00:44:56,00:44:59,He just shaped it instead of shaping it like a pine tree.
00:44:59,00:45:00,"The obvious thing to shape it like,"
00:45:00,00:45:01,"because it was the fifties,"
00:45:01,00:45:03,he shaped it like a sexy woman instead.
00:45:03,00:45:05,"Wow, Milty is the worst scent."
00:45:05,00:45:07,"According to professional scent removers,"
00:45:07,00:45:08,"the worst scent to remove, yes."
00:45:08,00:45:10,"Worse than, like, vomit, versus..."
00:45:10,00:45:12,"I think it's just more common than vomit, to be fair."
00:45:12,00:45:14,There are a lot of smells that will tell you
00:45:14,00:45:17,if there's something wrong with your car.
00:45:17,00:45:20,So I went onto one of those websites of Garage
00:45:20,00:45:21,who told you all the different things.
00:45:21,00:45:22,"So, burning smell."
00:45:22,00:45:24,"It means you might have burnt out fuse,"
00:45:24,00:45:26,or the air conditioning is overheated.
00:45:26,00:45:27,Or the cars on fire.
00:45:27,00:45:29,Or the cars on fire.
00:45:29,00:45:31,Rubber burning could be your brakes
00:45:31,00:45:33,or your tyres have an issue.
00:45:33,00:45:35,"Or your cars on fire, I suppose."
00:45:35,00:45:37,Rotten eggs means you have a problem
00:45:37,00:45:39,with your catalytic converter.
00:45:39,00:45:41,Or your fuel filter.
00:45:41,00:45:44,That's the excuse I'm going to use next time.
00:45:44,00:45:48,"Damn, this is an electric car."
00:45:48,00:45:51,"And the end is said, a dead animal smell."
00:45:51,00:45:53,This could be an animal that has crawled
00:45:53,00:45:55,into the engine and died.
00:45:55,00:45:57,"No, this is..."
00:45:57,00:45:59,"OK, one of the most annoying memories"
00:45:59,00:46:01,"of my childhood, and it lasted so long,"
00:46:01,00:46:04,"was, um, sorry, personal anecdote."
00:46:04,00:46:07,"But my brother got a pet snake, a little garter snake,"
00:46:07,00:46:09,"and we picked it up from the pet shop,"
00:46:09,00:46:11,"drove it home, got there, opened the cage,"
00:46:11,00:46:13,"it wasn't in it, it had escaped in the car."
00:46:13,00:46:14,The cage?
00:46:14,00:46:16,I think I see what you've gone wrong.
00:46:16,00:46:22,"Oh, yeah, he could, but he won't."
00:46:22,00:46:24,Don't worry.
00:46:24,00:46:25,"Well, he did."
00:46:25,00:46:28,There's a pet's helmet who's run out of boxes.
00:46:28,00:46:31,"Look, it had actually wrenched open"
00:46:31,00:46:34,the glass container that it was being kept in.
00:46:34,00:46:35,OK.
00:46:35,00:46:36,And it just escaped.
00:46:36,00:46:37,"And it, for..."
00:46:37,00:46:39,"I think we kept the car for about five years after that,"
00:46:39,00:46:41,and it smelled of dead snake
00:46:41,00:46:43,every time you turned on the heating or the aircon.
00:46:43,00:46:45,"And it was so funny, it was such a joke,"
00:46:45,00:46:47,"and everyone who got in our car was like,"
00:46:47,00:46:48,"""Hey, it's the dead snake car."""
00:46:48,00:46:51,"And it's unmistakable, a dead animal in your car."
00:46:51,00:46:53,"And they do like it, because there's a lot of, like,"
00:46:53,00:46:55,"warm, nice nooks to climb into."
00:46:55,00:46:58,I think there was a family in Australia recently
00:46:58,00:47:00,"who the dad was driving along,"
00:47:00,00:47:03,"and he suddenly said, ""Oh, got to pull over, pulled over."""
00:47:03,00:47:08,"And a meter-long snake had jumped out of the air conditioning,"
00:47:08,00:47:11,"the ventilation system, and tried to bite him with its head,"
00:47:11,00:47:13,and then retreated back in.
00:47:13,00:47:14,Yeah.
00:47:14,00:47:18,"So Mazda in 2011 had to recall 52,000 cars,"
00:47:18,00:47:21,"because there's a spider, which is called the yellow-sack spider,"
00:47:21,00:47:23,"who loved the smell of gasoline,"
00:47:23,00:47:25,"so they were attracted to the car,"
00:47:25,00:47:27,"and they would go into the vents, and they would just live there,"
00:47:27,00:47:29,and then the webs that they would build up around it
00:47:29,00:47:31,would mess up the pipes and overheat the car.
00:47:31,00:47:33,So it was really dangerous.
00:47:33,00:47:35,"So they had to recall 52,000."
00:47:35,00:47:39,So there's literally a specific spring inside this model of car
00:47:39,00:47:41,to stop spiders from making homes inside of it.
00:47:41,00:47:42,Wow.
00:47:42,00:47:43,That's really funny.
00:47:43,00:47:46,"I'm sorry, I've been so busy trying to think of a kind of..."
00:47:46,00:47:48,of the name for a snake that would live in a car.
00:47:48,00:47:49,OK.
00:47:49,00:47:50,Go on then.
00:47:50,00:47:51,Where'd you go?
00:47:51,00:47:52,Anahonda.
00:47:52,00:47:53,[LAUGHTER]
00:47:53,00:47:54,Yeah.
00:47:54,00:47:55,[APPLAUSE]
00:47:55,00:47:57,That is great.
00:47:57,00:48:00,"I mean, it was my car, so it works on that level."
00:48:00,00:48:01,"Oh, shit!"
00:48:01,00:48:02,Anahonda!
00:48:02,00:48:04,"For God's sake, people, this is genius."
00:48:04,00:48:05,I meant that.
00:48:05,00:48:06,"I meant, I missed it."
00:48:06,00:48:07,Yeah.
00:48:07,00:48:08,[LAUGHTER]
00:48:08,00:48:13,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:48:13,00:48:14,That is it.
00:48:14,00:48:15,That is all of our facts.
00:48:15,00:48:17,Thank you so much for listening.
00:48:17,00:48:19,"We will see you again, Newcastle."
00:48:19,00:48:20,You were awesome.
00:48:20,00:48:21,Thank you so much for having us.
00:48:21,00:48:23,We can't wait to come back again.
00:48:23,00:48:25,"For the rest of you, we'll see you again next week"
00:48:25,00:48:26,for another episode.
00:48:26,00:48:27,Goodbye!
00:48:27,00:48:30,[APPLAUSE]
00:48:30,00:48:34,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:48:34,00:48:36,(upbeat music)
