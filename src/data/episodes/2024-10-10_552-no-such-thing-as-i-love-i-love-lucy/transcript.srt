00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,960
 Hello everybody, it's Dan and Andy here from the podcast No Such Things a Fish, which you're already listening to.

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,120
 Yeah. Why are we here Andy? We're here to let everyone know that they can see us in the flesh.

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,040
 I thought we were here as a social thing. I can't believe it. You've yured me into recording an Amphir.

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,720
 I know. The other two saw through it. That's why it's you and me alone.

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:27,080
 But basically, we are concluding the UK and European leg of our Thunder Nerds tour.

6
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:33,240
 Or we only have four dates left. We're going to be playing Cardiff. We're going to be playing London twice and Manchester.

7
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:38,520
 And then kaput. That is it. It is over. And we still have some tickets left for a few of those shows.

8
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,040
 So if you want to come and see us, now is the time to get them.

9
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,880
 That's right. You can get tickets. There are still some available for Cardiff and there are still some available for the second London date.

10
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,440
 So Cardiff is on the 16th of October at the Wales Millennium Centre.

11
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:54,880
 London is the first one is sold out completely. The second one, there are still a few tickets left.

12
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,880
 That's on the 24th of October at the Theatre Royal on Drury Lane.

13
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:04,280
 So a couple of tickets are available for those two shows. And I'd say buy them now before the show.

14
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,080
 Yeah, we can't wait to see a bunch of you there. It's so fun. We have exciting guests.

15
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,080
 We have quizzes that we do on stage. We record an original new podcast each time.

16
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,800
 And we usually get a lot of weird stuff out of Andy to do with a very specific sci-fi movie.

17
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:24,200
 So yeah, a little teaser there. So when you come along, come and see us live.

18
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,000
 Go to knowsuchthingasafish.com. All the links are there to get your tickets from.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,600
 And yeah, we'll hopefully see you there soon. All right, let's get on to the actual podcast itself.

20
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,800
 Are we going to order a coffee at any point? No, I'm going home now. Okay.

21
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,800
 All right, on with the show. Bye.

22
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:59,600
 Hello and welcome to another episode of Know Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Newcastle.

23
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:09,000
 My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin.

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,400
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

25
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:21,600
 And in no particular order, here we go, starting with fact number one. And that is Anna.

26
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:27,200
 My fact this week is that British children have been asked to stop digging holes on beaches.

27
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,400
 After they dug one so big, it had to be filled in with a forklift truck.

28
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:37,800
 They're hard to get rid of. And this is a waste of public resources or this farmer's resources.

29
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,600
 So this was the Coast Guard in Padstow, who had to deal with this one.

30
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:48,800
 It was eight feet deep. That's deep. And nine foot wide.

31
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,800
 That's a source of more of a trap than a harmless activity, isn't it? It is.

32
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,800
 Well, I think I was wondering why I was so wide, because I'd always just make quite narrow holes.

33
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,200
 But if you're going that deep, you have to get people in it to dig it, don't you?

34
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,800
 So I suppose it does need to widen. But that does make it really hard to fill in.

35
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:11,000
 When it takes ages, they had to call Charlie Watson Smythe from Padstow Farm.

36
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 And he popped over and filled it in with his forklift truck.

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 Have you guys heard of the St Andrews Hole Digging Society?

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 No. Is it to do with golf? It sounds like it. It's not. It's a beach thing.

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 So it's only been going a few years, but I'm sure it'll last for many more.

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 So every fortnight, you just go onto the beach and you start digging a hole.

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 Is it in St Andrews in Scotland? Yeah. Cool.

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 People contribute to one main hole each time, but you can do your own thing.

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 They're not prescriptive. And basically, the guy who founded it said it's a really nice way

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 for men to do something together where you don't have to make eye contact with each other.

45
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 And that is what all men's activities basically are.

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 Do they cover up the holes at the end of the night?

47
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 I think they might fill it back in. I think they might be responsible diggers.

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 So when the wives said, "Where have you been?" they say, "Oh, we were digging holes, but we filled them all in."

49
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 But that's honestly what we were doing.

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 I think that's really nice. That's great.

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 I think that is just going against the public service announcement that I was trying to make with this fact.

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 Now you're telling everyone about the society, where you go and dig a hole.

53
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 That's true. I think they are very dangerous.

54
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 The other week, I was on a beach and my son dug a hole, which couldn't have been more than, I think, 30 centimetres deep, right?

55
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 And it was quite wide, but he put a little blanket over it.

56
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 And he said, "Daddy, come over here. I've got something for you."

57
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 And he said, "Leave a little plastic Loch Ness monster on there."

58
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 Dad, I found it.

59
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 He said, "Dad, come, come." And I saw it. I knew it, because I'd watched him dig the hole, right?

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 And I sat down, obviously faking it, and fell into the hole.

61
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 Vanilla, my wife, had to pick me out of it. My back was gone.

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 I was feeling so embarrassing from just like that.

63
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 So, you know, you've got to be careful.

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 They're dangerous. They can even be lethal.

65
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 Some more dangerous things on beaches, umbrellas, due to wind.

66
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 They send approximately 3,000 people to hospital every year in the US,

67
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 according to the US Consumer Product Safety Commission.

68
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 They don't send them literally by holding on.

69
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 This is very poppin' zip, yeah.

70
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 Just next to the H for the helipad, there's a little U.

71
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 There's a lightning, because as we all know, lightning doesn't strike at sea.

72
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 Please don't write in again. Listen, I made a claim that lightning rarely strikes at sea.

73
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 A lot of people just selectively didn't hear the word "rarely" and have been inundating the inbox.

74
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 Well, the truth is that it does rarely strike at sea, but if you're on the beach,

75
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 you're often going to be the tallest person, or not the tallest person, but the tallest thing.

76
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 On a beach, yeah.

77
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 Because there's not buildings around, there's not trees around, so you might get hit.

78
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 And of course, jellyfish. And what do you think? Should we on jellyfish stings?

79
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 What do you think, people of Newcastle?

80
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 Go!

81
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 Okay, there was a very loud yes, but I think that was more recreational than medical.

82
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 It's a no.

83
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 It doesn't really help, does it?

84
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 No, there's been 10 papers that have tested it, and none of them were positive.

85
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 About half of them have said it makes matters worse, and half said it doesn't make any difference at all.

86
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 It makes matters worse, because now you're embarrassed as well as today.

87
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 What you need to do is apply baking soda slurry, which is 50% baking soda and 50% seawater.

88
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 Now.

89
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 But that is for all jellyfish, apart from caribdia marsupialis and crissiora heisosella,

90
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 in which case you absolutely must not apply baking soda slurry.

91
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 Oh, what happens?

92
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 It makes it way, way worse.

93
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 It's like when you put mentos inside a cake bottle, is that just...

94
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 See, I think that's a good argument for just weeing on the wound.

95
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 Probably won't make it too much worse.

96
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 The odds of getting it...

97
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 I don't have time to do a DNA test on this jellyfish.

98
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 It's just stung me.

99
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 Surely everyone knows a crissiora heisosella when they see one.

100
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

101
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 That's very funny.

102
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 I found a professional sandcastle maker, did you, who...

103
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 I read a profile of her, and she's called Janelle Hawkins.

104
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 Yeah.

105
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 It just sounds a lot like James Harkin.

106
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 Does it?

107
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 That's funny.

108
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 We're supposed to be surprised by that.

109
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 It's a bit like James Harkin.

110
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 Janelle Hawkins.

111
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 Janelle Hawkins, yeah.

112
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 Spooky.

113
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 He's very spooky.

114
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 Spooky.

115
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 The thing is, Andy, I am not a sandcastle maker.

116
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 No.

117
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 Did you have anything else?

118
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 And I noticed that my default was defending you, but even I was not into that one either.

119
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 Is that all on her?

120
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 Can we move on?

121
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 Or is it...?

122
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 Let's move on.

123
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 Okay, great.

124
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 So, it is worth digging holes on some beaches, specifically Folkestone Beach.

125
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 Oh.

126
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 So, quite a long way for you guys to go in Newcastle, but if you are in Kent, there are still gold bars buried there.

127
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 I've been to Folkestone Beach as a child.

128
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 There are gold bars under the surface.

129
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 Yeah, well, you and Andy, you could have come away a millionaire.

130
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 Well, not a millionaire, technically, but in 2014, so actually after you were a child.

131
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 Thank you.

132
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 In 2014, an artist called Michael Salesstorfer buried £10,000 worth of gold bars there as an art installation.

133
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 Wow.

134
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 Quite a cool idea.

135
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 He said, "I'm making a constantly changing sculpture because everyone's going to be constantly digging up the beach."

136
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 I know it's making someone else do his work for him, but if you dug up one of these bars,

137
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 of which there were, I think, a lot, about 30, they were either worth £250 or £500,

138
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 and some people said they'd dug them up, but we reckon there are quite a few left.

139
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 Cool.

140
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 So, it's worth it.

141
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 Oh, yeah.

142
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 A lot of people spend their life digging, right?

143
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 Like, for various reasons, for work, we're on a beach.

144
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 We're constantly just digging holes into the ground.

145
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 And I always thought, "I wonder, like, you know, how close to the centre do you get when you're digging down?"

146
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 So the deepest hole we've ever dug, which was in Russia, has gone down 12,376 metres.

147
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 That's the deepest one, and that is called the Kola Superdeep borehole.

148
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 To put that in context, if you scaled the earth to the size of an apple,

149
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 the depth that we've gone hasn't even broken through the top layer of skin of the apple.

150
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 But the earth is almost the opposite of an apple.

151
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 With the apple, the best bit is the stuff inside, and the cross bit is rubbish.

152
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 Whereas on the earth, I think one of the reasons we haven't gone down is it's not really nice down there, is it?

153
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 It's not like, do you think if we just go 15,000 metres, we'll be like, "Oh my God, there's a whole other..."

154
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 No, they couldn't go any further. They didn't get 13,000 metres down and went,

155
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 "It's not great down here."

156
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 Dan, I love the idea of your son putting a little tartan blanket over the Kola Superdeep borehole

157
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 and leering you over to it.

158
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 Have you seen the Superdeep borehole?

159
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 Yes.

160
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 It's pretty small, isn't it? You could fall down it, I don't think.

161
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 No, no. You could.

162
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 It's nine inches across.

163
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 And on top of it, it's like a little manhole cover that it really looks like you could just undo.

164
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 If you dropped a pebble in it, you bet you couldn't even hear it hit the bottom.

165
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 I shouldn't think so.

166
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 We're so much better than all other animals at digging holes, but I was...

167
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 Do you mean with our hands?

168
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 No, sorry, because we've built those amazing machinery.

169
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 So other animals don't go that far into the ground.

170
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 That feels a bit unfair, Ben.

171
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 That's like saying we fly better than any animal, because we have the world.

172
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 True as well.

173
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 Yeah.

174
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 I was just surprised at the animal that has dug the second deepest, aside from us.

175
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 And I think it's cool and terrifying.

176
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 Oh, what is it?

177
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 What is it?

178
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 A Nile crocodile.

179
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 Yes.

180
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 What?

181
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 It's cool that they go...

182
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 With those little arms.

183
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 They actually do it terrifyingly with their jaws, apparently.

184
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 Really?

185
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 And they've gone down 12 metres, which is...

186
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 That's quite a lot less than us.

187
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 Yeah, it does sound terrifying.

188
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 It's a distant second place, isn't it?

189
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

190
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 Is it because they realised sooner that there wasn't nice appellee stuff down there than we did?

191
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 Deepest hole in Newcastle?

192
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 It's... I'm not going to answer that, in fact.

193
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 Nice.

194
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 But there is an official deepest hole in Newcastle.

195
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 It is. It's just outside St James's Park, isn't it?

196
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 The fact is just down there.

197
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 It's just the other side of this.

198
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 The science one.

199
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 The one that's 2,000 metres.

200
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 Yeah, yeah.

201
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 Really?

202
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 The Newcastle Science Central deep geothermal borehole.

203
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 They wanted to dig a geothermal hole, you know, dig down.

204
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 Right.

205
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 You've got free hot water forever.

206
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 And that's near St James's Park.

207
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 Andy, another hole and James connection.

208
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 I'm back on board, baby!

209
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 The last one wasn't really a hole connection.

210
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 There's much as a sandcastle connection.

211
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 I'm back out, baby.

212
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 I just... I love...

213
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 I found a headline in the local newspaper.

214
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 Is it The Chronicle?

215
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 What has the borehole done for Newcastle?

216
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 Conclusion was very little, sadly.

217
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 Well, it gave us...

218
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 It made us know that Newcastle,

219
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 many, many million years ago, was a tropical environment.

220
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 Mmm.

221
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 I don't know what you can do with that information.

222
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 Right.

223
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 But maybe that's why people in Newcastle go with their tops off all the time,

224
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 because they're harkening to a better time.

225
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 Long memory.

226
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 Just, I have a hole digger, a favourite hole digger person.

227
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 Who is it?

228
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 Well, I realised, as I said that,

229
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 that it's actually somebody who specifically didn't dig his own holes.

230
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 He had holes dug for him.

231
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 OK.

232
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 But it's Bernard Clevo,

233
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 who I...

234
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 It's one of my favourite people,

235
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 because I'm quite into medieval Christian sects,

236
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 and he was the founder of the Knights Templars.

237
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 She said sect.

238
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 Oh, it was sect.

239
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 Yeah.

240
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 It was sect.

241
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 That's a hell of a Tinder profile, isn't it?

242
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Yeah.

243
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 I'm really into medieval sects.

244
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 I own my own Wimple.

245
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 Right.

246
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 I will bring my own root scrape.

247
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 Yeah.

248
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 We're all having to readjust now

249
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 to just be interested in what you're about to say,

250
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 as opposed to what we were hoping you were going to say.

251
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 I know, picturing sort of monks with dildos.

252
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 OK.

253
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 Coming around.

254
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 OK, Anna.

255
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 Did you have a fact here?

256
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 Oh, yes, sorry.

257
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Bernard Clevo.

258
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 Yeah, co-founder of the Knights Templar.

259
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 He was this Albert, a very, very leading Christian thinker.

260
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 And this just goes to show what good friends will do.

261
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 So the fellow monks at the monastery absolutely adored him.

262
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 He was their spiritual leader.

263
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 They knew that he was so devout that he went to excessive lengths.

264
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 He went to excessive fasting.

265
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 So he would starve himself, basically, to show his devoutness.

266
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 And that caused gastric problems.

267
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 But he was so busy praying in the chapel that he never

268
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 wanted to leave until the last minute.

269
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 So he could never get to the loon time.

270
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 So his monks kept on digging and re-digging him a poo hole

271
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 just outside the chapel so that he could dash out

272
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 the last minute, drop the cassock, you know,

273
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 plop in there and dash back in.

274
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 And that's, if that's not friendship.

275
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 That's friendship.

276
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 That's beautiful.

277
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 I was going to quickly, there's lots of different types of holes.

278
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 So I was going to do a very quick quiz to see

279
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 if you could guess what these holes are.

280
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 So here's the first one.

281
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 Yule hole.

282
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 What's a little hole?

283
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 Christmas hole.

284
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 It's the opposite of a Christmas tree.

285
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 You just dig a nice yule hole.

286
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 If you can't afford a tree, trees are expensive.

287
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 You just throw the tinsel in the hole.

288
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 Lovely.

289
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 Yeah.

290
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 He's got it right.

291
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 So, that's obviously not right.

292
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 So a yule hole is, I saw this from Susie Dent on Twitter.

293
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 It's a term for the loosest notch on your belt

294
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 reserved for Christmas feasting so that when you put

295
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 a bit of extra on, you can use the yule hole in your belt.

296
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 That's great.

297
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 Ass holes.

298
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 Come on.

299
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 What are those?

300
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 Donkey, donkey holes in the holes for donkeys.

301
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 Yeah.

302
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 It's donkey holes.

303
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 That's amazing.

304
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 It's not a donkey's asshole.

305
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 It's not an ass asshole.

306
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 It is out in the desert areas.

307
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 Donkeys make holes that create desert streams

308
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 and they provide water holes.

309
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 They're not called ass holes.

310
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 They are called ass holes.

311
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 This was in a scientific paper that I read.

312
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 Wow.

313
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 Scientific paper.

314
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 Come on.

315
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 Yeah.

316
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 It's a remarkable thing because not only does it feed

317
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 the donkeys, the horses and their predators,

318
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 up to 57 other species go and sip from these ass holes.

319
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 But then when they dry up, they become nurseries

320
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 for germination.

321
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 No.

322
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 You're not sending your kid to the asshole nursery.

323
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 And it's time for fact number two.

324
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 That is Andy.

325
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 My fact is that during the Hundred Years' War,

326
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 every goose in England had to donate six feathers

327
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 to the war effort.

328
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 So, Hundred Years' War, England, France.

329
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 Very exciting.

330
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 I mean, as far as wars go, it was a long one.

331
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 Long periods of inactivity.

332
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 Yeah.

333
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 Hundred and sixteen years.

334
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 Mostly dull.

335
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 But during the hot bits of the war,

336
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 England needed enormous numbers of goose feathers

337
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 because they needed enormous numbers of arrows.

338
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 So, obviously, English Army mostly archer-based at the time,

339
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 like at Agincourt, 80% of the troops there were archers.

340
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 And, you know, in 1421, the government had to buy half a million arrows.

341
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 And all of them needed goose feathers to put at the blunt end

342
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 to help the arrows fly through the air

343
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 and hopefully, like, ooh, a Frenchman.

344
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 So, that was the whole name of the game.

345
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 And where are the geese?

346
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 You know, what a nightmare to organise.

347
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 But fortunately, pretty much every village in England

348
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 had a flock of geese just hanging around the village pond.

349
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 And in 1417, King Henry V ordered that his sheriffs take six feathers

350
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 from every goose of the land and deliver them to the Tower of London.

351
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 So, this was a way that...

352
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 So, did they send all those sheriffs out to all the towns just plucking cubs?

353
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 I guess the sheriffs were...

354
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 Yeah, they might have sent under sheriffs or whatever.

355
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 But it was a huge endeavour.

356
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 And, you know, like, Battle of Cressy, 1436...

357
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 Oh, 1346, sorry, so way earlier than this.

358
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 But the English archers on the day fired half a million arrows in one day.

359
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 80 per archer.

360
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 It's a lot.

361
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 It's so many feathers.

362
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 Yeah, they've got orders of, like, a million feathers

363
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 from, like, one area of England that they need.

364
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 I mean, because also, when you're building an arrow,

365
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 it's not just the feathers, obviously.

366
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 You need the wood in order to make the stick bit

367
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 between the plunt and the sharp bits.

368
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 You need...

369
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 That's vital.

370
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 Yeah, and by the way, there was someone who was designated

371
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 the official gatherer of all the sticks that sat in the arrow.

372
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 What?

373
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 Yeah, yeah.

374
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 He was given the ability to just walk into any forest in the UK

375
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 and commandeer it.

376
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 No.

377
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 I'm commandeering your forest.

378
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 Oh, I thought you meant he was given the right to look

379
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 for good-looking sticks on the ground.

380
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 That one's fantastic.

381
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 I think his job meant he could go anywhere in the UK

382
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 and point at a stick, and it was that stick that was now his.

383
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 Did they not just get bigger bits of wood and whittle them down?

384
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 Yeah, yeah.

385
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 Because they just have to look for exactly the right stick.

386
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 No, no, no.

387
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 He could chop down trees, and he could do whatever he wanted.

388
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

389
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 That's very cool.

390
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 That's very cool.

391
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 Yeah, because they also needed the wood for the bows as well, didn't they?

392
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 And it was illegal, actually, to make clogs out of ash for that time.

393
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 You weren't allowed to make wooden shoes, because they needed it for the bows.

394
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 Oh, really?

395
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 Presumably, at the time, it was one of the most fun things you could do

396
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 was make some clogs out of ash, so that was a sacrifice.

397
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 It's a different time.

398
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 I think this is a good theory that, basically, geese were way more important

399
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 to the war effort than, for example, horses.

400
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 If you didn't have horses, you know, like a war.

401
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 Let me ask you, who is collecting the sticks for the arrows?

402
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 Really, it's that guy's dog, isn't it?

403
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 So surely that's where dogs collecting sticks came from, the origin.

404
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 It may be.

405
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 It's a team effort.

406
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 Well, they had to get the arrows to the battlefield as well.

407
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

408
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 So they were often taken by horses.

409
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 They would have huge wagons there, because each archer could shoot

410
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 for about five minutes or so with the arrows that they had.

411
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 And then they had to get more arrows,

412
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 because you can't just bring them all to the front, right?

413
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 And so there was a wagon there, and they always had, like,

414
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 a battalion of young boys who would run to the wagon,

415
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 grab the arrows, and run to the front to give the arrows to the archers.

416
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 That's a cool job to have.

417
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 Would you bring emergency geese with you on the battlefield?

418
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 Oh, almost.

419
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 Certainly every archer would have two or three geese just in his back pocket.

420
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 You're saying that, like, you're joking.

421
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 No, I don't think you would.

422
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 But surely when you run out of arrows and you need to emergency make a new one,

423
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 I think the process of making an arrow is so time consuming.

424
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 It's like saying, would you have a bullet maker on the battlefield

425
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 in case you ran out of arrows?

426
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 Yeah, once you ran out of arrows, that's the end of the battle.

427
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 You just go home.

428
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 Well, I guess you go collect them, right? If they've worked.

429
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 It's not like darts, where once they're in the board,

430
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 then you pop over and you pluck them out.

431
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 Stop them all, everyone, just collect the arrows, and then we'll do it again.

432
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 Do we know how pedantic they were about the goose feathers?

433
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 Because I read that traditionally it had to be feathers from the male goose

434
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 that were on the outside of the arrow.

435
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 And then the two stabilizing feathers had to be from the female.

436
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 And I think there was a rumour that this made it fly better,

437
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 but I think it was irrelevant. That was just the tradition.

438
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 And I'm not sure you could tell.

439
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 So I wonder how pedantic Mr. Sheriff was.

440
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 I imagine at the start of the war they were quite pedantic.

441
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 And by year 115, they were probably like any old feather will do.

442
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 Because actually I think it was, most people did use goose feathers,

443
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 but if you were really fashionable, you might use a peacock feather in your arm.

444
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 That is classy, isn't it?

445
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 You know you've been shot by an aristocrat.

446
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 When you look there, you see a peacock feather sticking out of you.

447
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 Oh, fancy.

448
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 Was this the kind of the final last hurrah for the goose war effort?

449
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 Yeah, it probably was the last big effort.

450
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 Major time where it was like the dominating thing.

451
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 Because they were starting to bring in right at the end, at about 1430,

452
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 there were battles going on where cannons were starting to be used.

453
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 But it was quite funny reading the accounts, because they were quite shit back then.

454
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 So there was a battle where the Duke of Burgundy fired 412 cannonballs into a town

455
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 and only succeeded in killing one chicken.

456
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 Quick, get all the feathers!

457
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 I think goose feathers were used a bit later for fuses.

458
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 Because the hard bit of the feather is hollow,

459
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 you could kind of stick it in and put gunpowder in it and set fire to it and then run away.

460
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 That's nice.

461
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 Pretty sure that was true.

462
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 Oh, that's nice that they sort of stayed useful, that's lovely.

463
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 Because geese are big players in the world of human history.

464
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 Oh, yeah.

465
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 Everything that was written between about 600 and 1800 AD.

466
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 It was done by a goose.

467
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 Yes, a very patient goose.

468
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 No, but the quills that we used to write, they were pretty much all goose.

469
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 You could use a peacock or a swan or whatever.

470
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 But isn't it crazy as well that you can get left-handed and right-handed quills

471
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 based on which wing you took the quill off?

472
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 Yeah, it's much nicer if you're left-handed to use a right wing of a goose and vice versa,

473
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 because of the way that it curves.

474
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 But I hadn't realised that the reason the demand was so huge was that they didn't last very long at all,

475
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 because I guess you're shuffling them all the time, so you're lucky if your quill lasts a week.

476
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 If you're having a big letter, if it's someone's birthday, then your quill's going to last a couple of days.

477
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 Actually, I suppose you only write one birthday card, don't you?

478
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 Yeah, it's Christmas.

479
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 It's Christmas, thank you. It's Jesus' birthday.

480
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 But where we get penknife from, the word penknife, it's a knife to make a pen from a feather,

481
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 which I had never, I'd just never made that kind of thought.

482
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 Oh, yeah.

483
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 I think the word pen might come from feather.

484
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 It certainly does, penna.

485
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 One of my favourite etymologies, pen and pencil, come from completely different routes,

486
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 because yeah, penna comes from feather, going back to Latin,

487
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 whereas pencil comes through Old French from, I think a word that means little penis.

488
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 I think you're right.

489
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 Really? Okay.

490
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 Yeah.

491
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 That is good.

492
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 Totally different etymologies.

493
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 My favourite is that assholes comes from the...

494
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 No.

495
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 My favourite is, does anyone know why ducks are called ducks?

496
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 It's because they duck.

497
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 I only learned this the other day.

498
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 That's absolutely incredible.

499
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 It's like, because they duck under water, everyone was like, oh, duck, duck, duck, duck, and it's duck.

500
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 So humans were ducking sort of before ducks were ducking?

501
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 The words, as in the words, yeah.

502
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 I mean, ducks were ducking from...

503
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 Oh, yeah, of course, yeah.

504
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 What did we call them before? Just nothing.

505
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 We're just like, I can't even acknowledge that.

506
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 And there was a few different...

507
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 One thing we used to call them assfeeds, didn't we, ducks?

508
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 Did we?

509
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 Yeah, because they're always flapping their feet underneath their ass.

510
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 Oh, because when they're ducking, they've also got their bum sticking out of the water.

511
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 Yeah, yeah, anyway.

512
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 Oh, yeah.

513
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 But we're not talking about ducks, we're talking about geese.

514
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 Let's talk about golf.

515
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 Let's talk about golf, because goose feathers were used in golf balls.

516
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 Oh, really?

517
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 For a long time, actually.

518
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 And that was kind of what kept posh people playing golf and non-posh people not playing golf,

519
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 because they were so expensive.

520
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 And the balls were so expensive, they were even more expensive than the clubs in those days.

521
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 Okay.

522
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 And the way you would do it is you would get a load of goose feathers,

523
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 and you would put it in some cow hide or something,

524
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 and then you would soak it all.

525
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 And that made the leather get smaller, but it would make the goose's feathers get bigger.

526
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 And that kind of made a really, really solid ball.

527
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 And it was a perfect ball for playing golf.

528
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 Did they bounce those ones?

529
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 You don't really need your golf ball to bounce.

530
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 Okay.

531
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 They didn't bounce as much.

532
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 You're thinking of basketballs.

533
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 Oh, no.

534
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 But when you were making these golf balls,

535
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 every golf ball had a top hat full of feathers in it.

536
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 That was how you would measure how many feathers you needed to get a top hat,

537
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 fill it with feathers, and that was the right amount.

538
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 So they're really shrinking down.

539
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 Oh, yeah.

540
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 Very whimsical.

541
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 Wow.

542
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 I've got a riddle for you.

543
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 "The USA hoarded 1.5 million pounds of goose feathers in a strategic reserve."

544
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 Why?

545
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 Pillow fights?

546
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 No.

547
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 No.

548
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 Okay.

549
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 They say it again.

550
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 They had it all in one, like, building.

551
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 Well, I don't know about the exact administrative distribution

552
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 of the 1.5 million pounds of goose feathers.

553
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 They might have needed a few sheds or whatever.

554
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 A hole?

555
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 Could have been in an asshole.

556
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 No, we're not making asshole a thing, it's not happening.

557
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 Why?

558
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 Why?

559
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 I'm trying to set a guess.

560
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 Is this for when we go back to the olden days

561
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 and we have to rely on bow and arrows

562
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 because the nuclear blast has wiped out our guns?

563
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 Nice guess.

564
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 It's actually for if we need to go somewhere cold.

565
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 It's just to make down...

566
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 To make two bags.

567
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 To fill, it's basically sleeping bags

568
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 and boots and Arctic weather kit.

569
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 It's if suddenly we need to fight in the Arctic.

570
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 So you just have the strategic reserves in case...

571
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 So when James said pillow, he was right.

572
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 No, no.

573
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 He said James said pillow fights.

574
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 Completely different thing.

575
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 Frivolous in times of war.

576
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 Well...

577
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 Well, that's interesting.

578
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 Anyway, just that was part of the...

579
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 And are they not there anymore?

580
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 So is it worth attacking Alaska is what I'm asking.

581
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 Certainly is.

582
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 Guys, I need to move us on.

583
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 Do you want to sneak in anything before we...

584
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 Another use for a goose.

585
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 I'm sure you guys know this.

586
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 But Rabalé wrote in Gargantua,

587
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 "I wiped my arse with a hen, with a cock,

588
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 "with a calfskin, with a..."

589
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 Come on.

590
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 "With a hair, with a pigeon, with a cormorant,

591
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 "with Naterni's bag..."

592
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 What's Naterni's bag?

593
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 "But of all the tortures, arse wisps,

594
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 "bumfodders, tail napkins, bunkhole cleansers,

595
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 "there is none in the world comparable to the neck of a goose."

596
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 How big of a vindaloo are this guy's hats?

597
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 They took all of that.

598
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 Oh, goose.

599
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 All right, we are going to move on to fact number three.

600
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 It is time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

601
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 My fact this week is that American comedian Lucille Ball's teeth

602
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 could play the latest pop songs and bust Japanese spies.

603
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 Wow.

604
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 If you were around Lucille Ball at the right moment,

605
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 if you stuck your ear to her mouth, you could hear...

606
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 You could hear the latest pop songs.

607
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 So stupid.

608
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 But it's true.

609
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 Was she singing them?

610
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 She wasn't singing them.

611
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 No, it was legit the pop song.

612
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 So 1952, she was filming a movie.

613
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 "Dubare" was a lady with Red Skelton.

614
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 This was during World War II,

615
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 and she had recently just had some temporary lead fillings

616
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 put into her teeth, and as she drove home from the MGM studio,

617
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 she said, "One night I came into the valley and I heard music.

618
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 I reached down and turned the radio off, and it wasn't on.

619
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 The music kept getting louder and louder,

620
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 and then I realized it was coming from my mouth.

621
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 I even recognized the tune.

622
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 My mouth was humming and thumping with drumbeats,

623
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 and I thought I was losing my mind.

624
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 I thought, "What the hell is this?"

625
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 Then it started to subside.

626
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 I got home, went to bed,

627
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 not sure if I should tell anyone what happened

628
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 because they would think I was crazy.

629
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 Anyway, she told this to Buster Keaton, the comedian,

630
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 who she was good friends with,

631
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 and he said that she was picking up on radio broadcasts

632
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 through her fillings,

633
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 and that the same thing had happened to a friend of his,

634
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 and a lot of people were reporting this at the time,

635
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 and then she suddenly heard, coming through her teeth,

636
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 and she reported it to someone, and that person said,

637
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 "That could be Japanese spies who were trying to send water reach."

638
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 It could have been just the start of Inspector Moss.

639
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 Your lead fillings get radioed.

640
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 You need some metal in there,

641
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 which is going to receive the radio waves,

642
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 and then you need something in there

643
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 that's not quite solid that can vibrate,

644
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 and the radio waves will make that vibrate

645
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 and will make the sound come through.

646
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 Because it has happened in history.

647
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 There's an example in the American Journal of Psychiatry,

648
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 where a 35-year-old war veteran thought he was hearing voices,

649
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 but it turned out he was getting a local radio station.

650
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 There was a 65-year-old man who had hip replacements,

651
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 and the doctor was checking his feet,

652
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 and so put his stethoscope to his feet

653
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 and could hear Taylor Swift or whatever it was.

654
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 It was vibrating through his hip replacements.

655
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 That's brilliant.

656
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 Has it ever been loud enough that if you're like,

657
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 "Oh, I can't quite get the signal for a glass of FM,"

658
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 you can say, "Let's go round to Barry's house."

659
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 Gather around and grant her a tip.

660
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 That's really funny.

661
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 This is a field of study at the moment,

662
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 so the US Army has just got the molar mic, Raphon,

663
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 which is a radio that clips onto your tooth, basically,

664
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 and it transmits these signals through your jawbone.

665
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 So the sound goes into your jaw

666
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 and just goes straight to your auditory nerve.

667
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 So you can hear a big advantage.

668
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 You don't have to wear a microphone

669
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 if you're up to your neck in a swamp or whatever,

670
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 and they are testing us at the moment.

671
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 That's actually weirdly.

672
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 We talked about Beethoven on last week's episode,

673
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 and I don't think we mentioned that his friend designed for him

674
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 something like that, didn't he?

675
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 When Beethoven went deaf, he designed a contraption

676
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 that he put on his jaw against his jaw

677
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 that conducted sound for him

678
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 so that he could hear better what he was playing,

679
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 and it attached to his piano.

680
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 Didn't he have to bite his piano to hear it?

681
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 I think he did have to bite down on the piano, yes.

682
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 That was the prototype, him biting.

683
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 And then his friend was like, "I'll make you a straw, mate."

684
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 Yeah, and built like a metal rod.

685
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 Wow.

686
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 Just so that in case anyone doesn't recognize the name Lucy O'Ball,

687
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 I'm talking about "I Love Lucy,"

688
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 one of the greatest comedians of all time.

689
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 I mean, quite often voted the greatest

690
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 American TV comedian of all time.

691
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 "I Love Lucy" was the sitcom that she made, right?

692
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 Yeah, yeah. She was incredible.

693
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 She's going to have her day very soon

694
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 where she gets that second wind of championation.

695
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 She actually died 30 years ago.

696
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 I don't know why Dan thinks she's going to get a second wind.

697
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 No, I mean, I did like...

698
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 Someone's going to say she's my favorite

699
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 and we're all going to watch her movies again and so on.

700
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 Dan's new podcast, "I Love Lucy."

701
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 Which is entirely in Morse code, only receivable by teeth.

702
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 I didn't realize how cute she was.

703
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 So there was a thing of,

704
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 in one of the shows,

705
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 her character gives birth.

706
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 And I think it was the first time

707
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 any American TV had shown

708
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 a pregnant woman going to hospital

709
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 as a character.

710
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 44 million people watched that.

711
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 Yeah, it's insane.

712
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 Stunning, crazy numbers.

713
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 72% of American homes.

714
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 America used to shut down on a Monday night

715
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 because that was the night it was broadcast.

716
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 And weirdly, in that episode,

717
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 she gave birth the same night that her character

718
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 gave birth on TV.

719
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 Not that weirdly because she booked

720
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 in a caesarean for that day.

721
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 Yeah.

722
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 So "I Love Lucy" was possibly

723
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 the first major TV comedy

724
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 that was pre-recorded.

725
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 Up until then, you were doing live TV,

726
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 everything went out live.

727
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 And she and her husband, Desi,

728
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 they innovated the multi-camera

729
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 live audience pre-record.

730
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 So when that show did go out,

731
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 it was timed so that she would give birth

732
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 on the same night.

733
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 But what's amazing as well is Andy,

734
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 not only was it the first time they saw someone

735
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 going to deliver a baby,

736
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 but they couldn't even use the word "pregnancy"

737
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 on the show.

738
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 So the episode wasn't called "Lucy is Pregnant",

739
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 it was called "Lucy is Enciente"

740
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 because that's a...

741
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 What's that?

742
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 Well, it's a different word for pregnant.

743
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 I forgot to write which language down.

744
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 I assume it'll be Spanish because

745
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 it's Cuban.

746
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 And I think whenever they refer

747
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 to pregnancy, they would say she was expecting.

748
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 They would never say she was pregnant.

749
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 It's mad, it's like it was a swear word.

750
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 It's absolutely bizarre. Did no one know

751
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 about pregnancy then?

752
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 Actually, one of the facts that someone

753
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 in the audience sent to us today

754
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 said something like...

755
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 I think it was 1974

756
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 and it was the formula one.

757
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 And they refused to show it on the BBC

758
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 because one of the teams was sponsored

759
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 and all the other teams were sponsored

760
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 by cigarette brands.

761
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 And they were like, "No, no, condoms.

762
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 Definitely can't have that on our TV."

763
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 Yeah, and when they did

764
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 the pregnancy announcement script as well,

765
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 they had to, because in

766
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 TV land, often you have to give it

767
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 to people who are looking to see if there's anything

768
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 that can be offensive. So the BBC have...

769
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 James, what's it called when they have to have a pass

770
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 through it to make sure it's okay?

771
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 Spoilspot.

772
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 Yeah, that basically.

773
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 Compliance. The compliance was not only done

774
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 by someone who was in-house, part of the network,

775
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 but it had to be handed to a priest, a rabbi.

776
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 No. And they themselves

777
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 are a joke as well.

778
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 Look, we're all going with the big question about Lucy.

779
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 Lucille, was she a communist?

780
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 Oh. She was accused of being a communist.

781
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 Was she? Yeah, and she was registered to vote

782
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 as a communist. Oh, so that says

783
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 she's a communist. Yeah, it does.

784
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 People claimed, people said they went to her house

785
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 to have communist meetings, didn't they?

786
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 But she did insist that she wasn't a communist.

787
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 She said she was basically hauled

788
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 over the coals in 1952 by the McCarthyite

789
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 when the sort of commie

790
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 hunting fever was at its absolute height.

791
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 And, you know, she gave evidence, she said,

792
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 "Yes, I was registered to vote as a communist

793
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 in the '30s, but it was only to please

794
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 my elderly grandfather." Very good.

795
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 Exclusive Stalin.

796
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 I love Lenin.

797
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 There was a movie about Lucille Ball, wasn't there

798
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 quite recently, and there's a big scene in that

799
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 where her husband

800
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 comes out in front of the audience

801
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 and says she's not a communist.

802
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 And he said, "The only thing

803
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 read about Lucy is her hair,

804
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 and even that's not legitimate."

805
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 That's very good. Very good.

806
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 It was an amazing relationship, must have been quite,

807
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 I don't know, we all get excited

808
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 by celebrity relationships. Well, I don't,

809
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 because I'm above it, but many do.

810
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 They were one of the originals.

811
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 Desi Arnaz was her husband. They'd been together

812
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 for ten years when they made "I Love Lucy,"

813
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 and they played husband and wife in that.

814
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 They sort of played versions of their own characters, didn't they?

815
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 And it must have been quite groundbreaking then,

816
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 because he was a Cuban migrant,

817
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 and she was this ginger person,

818
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 the TV station said at the time...

819
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 It's hardly been seen on TV before.

820
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 A Cuban and a ginger.

821
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 They had to call her

822
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 Strawberry Blond, didn't they?

823
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 I remember TV was black

824
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 and white back then as well.

825
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 It's more the fact she was white, isn't it?

826
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 No, they kept on quoting,

827
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 "No one's going to believe that a pale redhead

828
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 "is going to go out with a Cuban."

829
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 Maybe it was like, "Is she dark hair?"

830
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 You know, maybe it's slightly more plausible.

831
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 Anyway, there was lots of fuss about it,

832
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 but they were an amazing relationship,

833
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 and they did divorce, but they stayed very good friends.

834
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 But he was interesting as well, Desi Arnaz,

835
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 and he gave us the conga.

836
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 Did he?

837
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 What do you mean he gave it to us?

838
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 He basically introduced the conga line

839
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 to the West.

840
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 He started, and then another person got behind him

841
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 before he knew it, the entire population of America.

842
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 Yeah, yeah, America came to a standstill for years.

843
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 That is a big one, isn't it?

844
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 It's a big one, and that's obviously not how it started,

845
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 but it was a big thing in Cuba,

846
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 so Cubans in America tended to know about it.

847
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 His father had been mayor of Santiago de Cuba in the '20s,

848
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 and actually his father had repeatedly tried to ban the conga

849
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 for being immoral and dangerous and sexy.

850
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 Which it is.

851
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 Which it is!

852
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 But he then set up a club.

853
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 It's the sexiest dance I know.

854
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 I don't know about you guys.

855
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 It depends where the conga goes into, isn't it?

856
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 Yeah, I don't know.

857
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 It doesn't go into anything!

858
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 Do you mean which room it goes into?

859
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 If you keep it in the kitchen, it's not sexy.

860
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 If it goes into the sex dungeon...

861
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 I think a conga makes a sex dungeon unsexy

862
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 rather than the other way round.

863
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 Oh, man, I'd be so terrified if I was halfway along the conga,

864
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 and I saw them going into the sex dungeon.

865
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 You can't change the course of the conga.

866
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 You can't do it.

867
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 We just start walking quicker, so we get through the sex dungeon faster,

868
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 and hopefully back out into the billiard's room or something normal.

869
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 Are you ever allowed to jump in front of a conga to avert crisis?

870
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 You're not allowed to speed...

871
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 No, but you can exert subtle pressure from behind.

872
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 Like, let's crack on.

873
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 Can we just...

874
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 Pressure from behind is what they want.

875
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 Oh, no!

876
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 I started the sex dungeon party!

877
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 Oh, no!

878
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 Anyway...

879
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 Are we talking about Lucille Ball?

880
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 He started a club.

881
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 He started making clear a club called the conga,

882
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 where he introduced conga dancing.

883
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 And that's how it came to us, so thank you.

884
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 Thank you, Desi. Here's something we've got to thank,

885
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 largely Lucille, but also Desi for.

886
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 It is thanks to her that we have Star Trek.

887
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 Star Trek exists because of Lucille Ball.

888
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 So, Jean Roddenbury had pitched the idea to quite a few productions.

889
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 Jean Roddenbury being the founder/creator of Star Trek,

890
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 and not many people wanted it.

891
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 Lucille said this sounds fantastic.

892
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 There's a rumour that she misunderstood what it was,

893
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 because she thought it was celebrities going on treks, basically.

894
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 Star Trek.

895
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 It was at a time where Bob Hope was going with USO members

896
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 to the war zones, and it was a big Star Power thing.

897
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 That's a great name for a show.

898
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 Star Trek, right?

899
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 Star Trek's about to show, arguably.

900
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 But then she...

901
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 She then found out what it was about,

902
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 and she said, "This sounds very good."

903
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 They made a pilot that was rejected,

904
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 and she said, "Let's give it another pilot."

905
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 And it was the second pilot that allowed for Star Trek to be made.

906
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 And she did that with Mission Impossible as well,

907
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 and a number of other shows.

908
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 The old one, which I actually didn't know was a thing.

909
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 Anna.

910
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 I'm so sorry!

911
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 It's like you don't listen to me at all!

912
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 (LAUGHTER)

913
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 Yeah, the TV series, Mission Impossible.

914
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 Yeah.

915
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 Very good.

916
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 Well, not only was she a nerd, she was a jerk.

917
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 Yes, I heard that too.

918
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 Yes.

919
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 The soda jerk.

920
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
 Oh.

921
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 I just heard she was an unpleasant person to work with.

922
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 Yeah, yeah.

923
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 Okay, in the 20s and the 50s, it was this huge phenomenon.

924
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 I didn't know how big a deal it was,

925
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 so it was in drugstores, chemists, basically.

926
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 But they had soda fountains there,

927
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 and you'd have the soda jerk working the soda fountain,

928
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
 called that because they jerk the handle

929
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
 as they're giving it to you.

930
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 But they weren't really, that wasn't their job.

931
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 Their main job was to be an entertainer.

932
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 And they were all about punning, wordplay,

933
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 making up crazy new terms for these drinks.

934
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 You'd order, like, a cherry Coke,

935
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 and they'd shout, "Stretch one, paint it red!"

936
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 And that means they want a cherry Coke.

937
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 Wow.

938
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
 Aren't they also the one making the drink?

939
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 No.

940
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
 Who are they shouting this to?

941
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
 Yeah, I think there's another soda jerk behind them,

942
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 who's doing a bit of the back and forth.

943
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
 Okay, okay, a bit of business.

944
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
 You'd order a Mary Garden.

945
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
 Mary Garden was a famous singer,

946
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
 and you ordered a Mary Garden because it made you sing,

947
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 and that was the drink where you wanted them to spike it

948
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
 with laxatives because you're blocked up

949
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
 and you needed to have some diarrhea.

950
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 Oh, my God!

951
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 That, you know what?

952
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 That sounds mad, but I do think that is missing

953
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 from modern cocktail bars, where...

954
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
 And if you could just pull off a couple of the old

955
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 shit-a-roonies in there, that would be...

956
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 It is time for our final fact of the show,

957
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 and that is James.

958
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
 Okay, my fact this week is that the smelliest car

959
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 at the British Motor Museum

960
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 belongs to Queen Elizabeth II.

961
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 Are you allowed to make those sort of accusations?

962
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
 It's not an accusation, it's a fact.

963
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 That's all we do on this show, we do facts.

964
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 What are some of us?

965
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 I'm...

966
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
 I'm going to guess that it smelled of corgi.

967
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
 Oh, okay.

968
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 It just had constant corgis all the way through it.

969
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 Okay, well, the people who smelled it...

970
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 dealt it.

971
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 No, the people who smelled it said,

972
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
 "It's not a terribly nice smell, but it is very interesting.

973
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 "It has an almost cheesy, fatty smell to it."

974
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 Ooh, is that Philip?

975
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 No, so let me just explain how we know this.

976
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
 So, there is a guy at York University called Dr. Will Tullet,

977
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 and he's head of the British part

978
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 of a European research programme into smell,

979
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 and they're trying to find lots of old smells

980
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 and kind of save them before they disappear.

981
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
 And they ask people what kind of smells are you worried

982
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 are going to disappear, and a lot of people are worried

983
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 that the old smell of cars is going to disappear,

984
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 because now we're all going electric,

985
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 there's not going to be any petrol cars,

986
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 cars are going to change, the smell is going to change,

987
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,000
 we're going to miss those old cheesy smells of cars.

988
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 And so they thought, well, we need to find the smell of an old car,

989
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 so what should we do?

990
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 We'll go to Gaydon in Warwickshire,

991
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
 which is where the British Motor Museum is,

992
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
 and we'll say, "Where is your smelliest car, please?"

993
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 And they said, "Well, without doubt,

994
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
 "the smelliest one is this Rover from the 1970s

995
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 "that belonged to the Queen."

996
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 That's very interesting, because there's this thing about the Queen

997
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 that supposedly she thought the world smelled of fresh paint,

998
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
 because everywhere she goes, it's just been painted fresh

999
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
 for her arrival, so she just smells this all the time.

1000
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
 So it might have been a reaction to that.

1001
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 And also, this had a thick carpet added to it.

1002
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
 I presume for royal luxury.

1003
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 That's absolutely right.

1004
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 It had a thick, curly pile carpet,

1005
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
 and it also had windows that were sealed,

1006
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
 in case there was a gas attack out there, they wouldn't go.

1007
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 Oh, so it keeps the smell in.

1008
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
 Basically, the smell stayed in there

1009
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 because they got into the carpet and they stayed in there

1010
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
 and they couldn't escape because all the windows were sealed.

1011
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
 So it could be some occupant just let off a huge fart,

1012
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
 shut the door straight away,

1013
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
 and it just hasn't been able to get out ever since,

1014
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
 until these people enter.

1015
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
 I'm sure it was the Coggies that did that.

1016
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 But anyway, if you are interested,

1017
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 then in 2023 they produced some car fresheners

1018
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
 with the royal car smell.

1019
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
 Really?

1020
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
 So you can get a little tree in your car.

1021
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
 They'll give you the smell of the smelly Queen's car.

1022
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
 That's so good.

1023
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 I would just, while we're mentioning the modifications

1024
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 that were made to her car,

1025
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 we know that the presidential car, the beast,

1026
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 has things like it has blood in it

1027
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
 of the president in case there's an assassination

1028
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 they need to administer abroad.

1029
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
 Really?

1030
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 Yeah, there's all sorts of modifications to the car.

1031
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
 And I thought surely any time the Queen had a car,

1032
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
 they pimped the car.

1033
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
 So there's that, the windows.

1034
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
 There's also, in between the two front seats,

1035
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
 there was a little tray that pulled out

1036
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
 that allowed her to put her handbag onto the tray,

1037
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
 just in the middle of her.

1038
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 Yeah.

1039
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
 I just remembered, I've seen the Queen's car.

1040
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
 Oh yeah?

1041
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
 I walked past her once.

1042
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
 Was she in it?

1043
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
 No.

1044
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
 Were you in the Gaiden multi-museum?

1045
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
 No, I wasn't.

1046
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
 It was just, she was visiting the university I was at.

1047
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
 And were you blown away by the car smell?

1048
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
 Did you sort of have to cross the street?

1049
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
 No, it wasn't a rover.

1050
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
 It was one of the posh cars.

1051
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
 It was a sort of, I don't know, Bentley or something.

1052
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
 But it was, but it has the special huge,

1053
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
 you know how some cars have the little sticky upy Mercedes thing?

1054
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
 The Queen's car had a massive St. George

1055
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
 and the dragon silver thing on the bonnet.

1056
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
 Did you see it?

1057
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 Yeah.

1058
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
 It was quite cool.

1059
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
 I think that was unique.

1060
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
 Yeah.

1061
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
 And does the King get any of this shit?

1062
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
 Or is it just like, we've stopped caring?

1063
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
 I think King does.

1064
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:44,000
 Well, doesn't he use wine for petrol?

1065
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
 Wine and cheese.

1066
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
 Wine and trees.

1067
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
 Just general smells, of course.

1068
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
 So the little pine tree thing that they put in cars,

1069
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
 like the classic car freshener, was debuted in 1952,

1070
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
 which is actually the year the Queen became the Queen, isn't it?

1071
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
 Oh yeah, she coronated in '53.

1072
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
 But she did, yeah.

1073
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
 Anyway, she didn't invent it.

1074
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
 But that was not initially in the shape of a Christmas tree

1075
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
 or a pine tree.

1076
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
 Do you know what it was originally in the shape of?

1077
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
 Oh.

1078
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
 Oh gosh.

1079
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
 Something smelly.

1080
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
 A candle.

1081
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
 No.

1082
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,000
 It was, I'm afraid, a sexy, pin-up model woman.

1083
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
 Was it?

1084
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
 Was it?

1085
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
 Yeah.

1086
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
 Was it with a big bottom, though, that could be farting?

1087
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
 Because it was the era of those postcards on the beach.

1088
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
 No, it wasn't invented in Bogner.

1089
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
 No, it was in...

1090
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:32,000
 You know those World War II planes,

1091
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
 and you'd paint a sexy woman on the side of your plane?

1092
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
 You know that kind of fetty boom?

1093
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
 Kind of pin-up.

1094
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 Yeah, the pin-up thing.

1095
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
 That was the shape of the first.

1096
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
 It was a chemist called Julius Semen.

1097
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
 Julius Semen?

1098
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
 Yeah, say that surname again.

1099
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
 Semen, it sort of finished.

1100
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
 He's got an accent I don't know how to pronounce.

1101
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
 He bumped into a milkman recently who said,

1102
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
 "My truck smells of spilt milk all the time,

1103
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
 and it's horrible.

1104
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
 It clings to the truck.

1105
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
 Can you invent something?"

1106
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 And he said, "Yeah, I'll go and invent the pine-centred thing."

1107
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
 He just shaped it instead of shaping it like a pine tree.

1108
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
 The obvious thing to shape it like,

1109
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
 because it was the fifties,

1110
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
 he shaped it like a sexy woman instead.

1111
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
 Wow, Milty is the worst scent.

1112
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
 According to professional scent removers,

1113
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
 the worst scent to remove, yes.

1114
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
 Worse than, like, vomit, versus...

1115
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
 I think it's just more common than vomit, to be fair.

1116
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
 There are a lot of smells that will tell you

1117
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
 if there's something wrong with your car.

1118
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 So I went onto one of those websites of Garage

1119
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
 who told you all the different things.

1120
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
 So, burning smell.

1121
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
 It means you might have burnt out fuse,

1122
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
 or the air conditioning is overheated.

1123
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
 Or the cars on fire.

1124
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
 Or the cars on fire.

1125
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
 Rubber burning could be your brakes

1126
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
 or your tyres have an issue.

1127
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
 Or your cars on fire, I suppose.

1128
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
 Rotten eggs means you have a problem

1129
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
 with your catalytic converter.

1130
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 Or your fuel filter.

1131
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
 That's the excuse I'm going to use next time.

1132
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
 Damn, this is an electric car.

1133
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
 And the end is said, a dead animal smell.

1134
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
 This could be an animal that has crawled

1135
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
 into the engine and died.

1136
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
 No, this is...

1137
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
 OK, one of the most annoying memories

1138
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
 of my childhood, and it lasted so long,

1139
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
 was, um, sorry, personal anecdote.

1140
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
 But my brother got a pet snake, a little garter snake,

1141
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
 and we picked it up from the pet shop,

1142
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
 drove it home, got there, opened the cage,

1143
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
 it wasn't in it, it had escaped in the car.

1144
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
 The cage?

1145
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
 I think I see what you've gone wrong.

1146
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:22,000
 Oh, yeah, he could, but he won't.

1147
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
 Don't worry.

1148
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
 Well, he did.

1149
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
 There's a pet's helmet who's run out of boxes.

1150
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
 Look, it had actually wrenched open

1151
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
 the glass container that it was being kept in.

1152
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
 OK.

1153
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
 And it just escaped.

1154
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
 And it, for...

1155
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
 I think we kept the car for about five years after that,

1156
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
 and it smelled of dead snake

1157
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
 every time you turned on the heating or the aircon.

1158
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
 And it was so funny, it was such a joke,

1159
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
 and everyone who got in our car was like,

1160
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
 "Hey, it's the dead snake car."

1161
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
 And it's unmistakable, a dead animal in your car.

1162
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
 And they do like it, because there's a lot of, like,

1163
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
 warm, nice nooks to climb into.

1164
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
 I think there was a family in Australia recently

1165
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
 who the dad was driving along,

1166
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
 and he suddenly said, "Oh, got to pull over, pulled over."

1167
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:08,000
 And a meter-long snake had jumped out of the air conditioning,

1168
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
 the ventilation system, and tried to bite him with its head,

1169
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
 and then retreated back in.

1170
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
 Yeah.

1171
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,000
 So Mazda in 2011 had to recall 52,000 cars,

1172
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
 because there's a spider, which is called the yellow-sack spider,

1173
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
 who loved the smell of gasoline,

1174
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
 so they were attracted to the car,

1175
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
 and they would go into the vents, and they would just live there,

1176
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
 and then the webs that they would build up around it

1177
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
 would mess up the pipes and overheat the car.

1178
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
 So it was really dangerous.

1179
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
 So they had to recall 52,000.

1180
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,000
 So there's literally a specific spring inside this model of car

1181
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
 to stop spiders from making homes inside of it.

1182
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
 Wow.

1183
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
 That's really funny.

1184
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
 I'm sorry, I've been so busy trying to think of a kind of...

1185
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
 of the name for a snake that would live in a car.

1186
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
 OK.

1187
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
 Go on then.

1188
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
 Where'd you go?

1189
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
 Anahonda.

1190
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
 [LAUGHTER]

1191
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
 Yeah.

1192
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
 [APPLAUSE]

1193
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
 That is great.

1194
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
 I mean, it was my car, so it works on that level.

1195
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
 Oh, shit!

1196
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
 Anahonda!

1197
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
 For God's sake, people, this is genius.

1198
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
 I meant that.

1199
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
 I meant, I missed it.

1200
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
 Yeah.

1201
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
 [LAUGHTER]

1202
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:13,000
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

1203
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
 That is it.

1204
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
 That is all of our facts.

1205
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
 Thank you so much for listening.

1206
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
 We will see you again, Newcastle.

1207
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
