00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960
 Hello everybody, it's Dan and Andy here from the podcast No Such Things a Fish, which you're already listening to.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.120
 Yeah. Why are we here Andy? We're here to let everyone know that they can see us in the flesh.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.040
 I thought we were here as a social thing. I can't believe it. You've yured me into recording an Amphir.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.720
 I know. The other two saw through it. That's why it's you and me alone.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:27.080
 But basically, we are concluding the UK and European leg of our Thunder Nerds tour.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:33.240
 Or we only have four dates left. We're going to be playing Cardiff. We're going to be playing London twice and Manchester.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.520
 And then kaput. That is it. It is over. And we still have some tickets left for a few of those shows.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.040
 So if you want to come and see us, now is the time to get them.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.880
 That's right. You can get tickets. There are still some available for Cardiff and there are still some available for the second London date.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.440
 So Cardiff is on the 16th of October at the Wales Millennium Centre.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.880
 London is the first one is sold out completely. The second one, there are still a few tickets left.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.880
 That's on the 24th of October at the Theatre Royal on Drury Lane.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.280
 So a couple of tickets are available for those two shows. And I'd say buy them now before the show.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.080
 Yeah, we can't wait to see a bunch of you there. It's so fun. We have exciting guests.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.080
 We have quizzes that we do on stage. We record an original new podcast each time.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.800
 And we usually get a lot of weird stuff out of Andy to do with a very specific sci-fi movie.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.200
 So yeah, a little teaser there. So when you come along, come and see us live.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.000
 Go to knowsuchthingasafish.com. All the links are there to get your tickets from.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.600
 And yeah, we'll hopefully see you there soon. All right, let's get on to the actual podcast itself.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.800
 Are we going to order a coffee at any point? No, I'm going home now. Okay.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.800
 All right, on with the show. Bye.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:59.600
 Hello and welcome to another episode of Know Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Newcastle.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:09.000
 My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.400
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:21.600
 And in no particular order, here we go, starting with fact number one. And that is Anna.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.200
 My fact this week is that British children have been asked to stop digging holes on beaches.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.400
 After they dug one so big, it had to be filled in with a forklift truck.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.800
 They're hard to get rid of. And this is a waste of public resources or this farmer's resources.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.600
 So this was the Coast Guard in Padstow, who had to deal with this one.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:48.800
 It was eight feet deep. That's deep. And nine foot wide.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.800
 That's a source of more of a trap than a harmless activity, isn't it? It is.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.800
 Well, I think I was wondering why I was so wide, because I'd always just make quite narrow holes.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.200
 But if you're going that deep, you have to get people in it to dig it, don't you?

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.800
 So I suppose it does need to widen. But that does make it really hard to fill in.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.000
 When it takes ages, they had to call Charlie Watson Smythe from Padstow Farm.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 And he popped over and filled it in with his forklift truck.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 Have you guys heard of the St Andrews Hole Digging Society?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 No. Is it to do with golf? It sounds like it. It's not. It's a beach thing.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
 So it's only been going a few years, but I'm sure it'll last for many more.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 So every fortnight, you just go onto the beach and you start digging a hole.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 Is it in St Andrews in Scotland? Yeah. Cool.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 People contribute to one main hole each time, but you can do your own thing.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 They're not prescriptive. And basically, the guy who founded it said it's a really nice way

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 for men to do something together where you don't have to make eye contact with each other.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 And that is what all men's activities basically are.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 Do they cover up the holes at the end of the night?

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 I think they might fill it back in. I think they might be responsible diggers.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 So when the wives said, "Where have you been?" they say, "Oh, we were digging holes, but we filled them all in."

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 But that's honestly what we were doing.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 I think that's really nice. That's great.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 I think that is just going against the public service announcement that I was trying to make with this fact.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 Now you're telling everyone about the society, where you go and dig a hole.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 That's true. I think they are very dangerous.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 The other week, I was on a beach and my son dug a hole, which couldn't have been more than, I think, 30 centimetres deep, right?

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 And it was quite wide, but he put a little blanket over it.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 And he said, "Daddy, come over here. I've got something for you."

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 And he said, "Leave a little plastic Loch Ness monster on there."

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 Dad, I found it.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 He said, "Dad, come, come." And I saw it. I knew it, because I'd watched him dig the hole, right?

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 And I sat down, obviously faking it, and fell into the hole.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 Vanilla, my wife, had to pick me out of it. My back was gone.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 I was feeling so embarrassing from just like that.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 So, you know, you've got to be careful.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 They're dangerous. They can even be lethal.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 Some more dangerous things on beaches, umbrellas, due to wind.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 They send approximately 3,000 people to hospital every year in the US,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 according to the US Consumer Product Safety Commission.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 They don't send them literally by holding on.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 This is very poppin' zip, yeah.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 Just next to the H for the helipad, there's a little U.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 There's a lightning, because as we all know, lightning doesn't strike at sea.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 Please don't write in again. Listen, I made a claim that lightning rarely strikes at sea.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 A lot of people just selectively didn't hear the word "rarely" and have been inundating the inbox.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 Well, the truth is that it does rarely strike at sea, but if you're on the beach,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 you're often going to be the tallest person, or not the tallest person, but the tallest thing.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 On a beach, yeah.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 Because there's not buildings around, there's not trees around, so you might get hit.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 And of course, jellyfish. And what do you think? Should we on jellyfish stings?

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
 What do you think, people of Newcastle?

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 Go!

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 Okay, there was a very loud yes, but I think that was more recreational than medical.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
 It's a no.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 It doesn't really help, does it?

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 No, there's been 10 papers that have tested it, and none of them were positive.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 About half of them have said it makes matters worse, and half said it doesn't make any difference at all.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
 It makes matters worse, because now you're embarrassed as well as today.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 What you need to do is apply baking soda slurry, which is 50% baking soda and 50% seawater.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000
 Now.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 But that is for all jellyfish, apart from caribdia marsupialis and crissiora heisosella,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
 in which case you absolutely must not apply baking soda slurry.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 Oh, what happens?

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 It makes it way, way worse.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 It's like when you put mentos inside a cake bottle, is that just...

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
 See, I think that's a good argument for just weeing on the wound.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 Probably won't make it too much worse.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 The odds of getting it...

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
 I don't have time to do a DNA test on this jellyfish.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 It's just stung me.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
 Surely everyone knows a crissiora heisosella when they see one.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 That's very funny.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 I found a professional sandcastle maker, did you, who...

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 I read a profile of her, and she's called Janelle Hawkins.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 Yeah.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 It just sounds a lot like James Harkin.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 Does it?

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 That's funny.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 We're supposed to be surprised by that.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000
 It's a bit like James Harkin.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 Janelle Hawkins.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 Janelle Hawkins, yeah.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 Spooky.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000
 He's very spooky.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 Spooky.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 The thing is, Andy, I am not a sandcastle maker.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 No.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 Did you have anything else?

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
 And I noticed that my default was defending you, but even I was not into that one either.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 Is that all on her?

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 Can we move on?

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000
 Or is it...?

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000
 Let's move on.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000
 Okay, great.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 So, it is worth digging holes on some beaches, specifically Folkestone Beach.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 Oh.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
 So, quite a long way for you guys to go in Newcastle, but if you are in Kent, there are still gold bars buried there.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 I've been to Folkestone Beach as a child.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 There are gold bars under the surface.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
 Yeah, well, you and Andy, you could have come away a millionaire.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
 Well, not a millionaire, technically, but in 2014, so actually after you were a child.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 Thank you.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:10.000
 In 2014, an artist called Michael Salesstorfer buried £10,000 worth of gold bars there as an art installation.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 Wow.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 Quite a cool idea.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 He said, "I'm making a constantly changing sculpture because everyone's going to be constantly digging up the beach."

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 I know it's making someone else do his work for him, but if you dug up one of these bars,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 of which there were, I think, a lot, about 30, they were either worth £250 or £500,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 and some people said they'd dug them up, but we reckon there are quite a few left.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 Cool.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 So, it's worth it.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
 A lot of people spend their life digging, right?

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 Like, for various reasons, for work, we're on a beach.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 We're constantly just digging holes into the ground.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 And I always thought, "I wonder, like, you know, how close to the centre do you get when you're digging down?"

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 So the deepest hole we've ever dug, which was in Russia, has gone down 12,376 metres.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 That's the deepest one, and that is called the Kola Superdeep borehole.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 To put that in context, if you scaled the earth to the size of an apple,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 the depth that we've gone hasn't even broken through the top layer of skin of the apple.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 But the earth is almost the opposite of an apple.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
 With the apple, the best bit is the stuff inside, and the cross bit is rubbish.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 Whereas on the earth, I think one of the reasons we haven't gone down is it's not really nice down there, is it?

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 It's not like, do you think if we just go 15,000 metres, we'll be like, "Oh my God, there's a whole other..."

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 No, they couldn't go any further. They didn't get 13,000 metres down and went,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 "It's not great down here."

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 Dan, I love the idea of your son putting a little tartan blanket over the Kola Superdeep borehole

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 and leering you over to it.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
 Have you seen the Superdeep borehole?

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 Yes.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
 It's pretty small, isn't it? You could fall down it, I don't think.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 No, no. You could.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 It's nine inches across.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:56.000
 And on top of it, it's like a little manhole cover that it really looks like you could just undo.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 If you dropped a pebble in it, you bet you couldn't even hear it hit the bottom.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 I shouldn't think so.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
 We're so much better than all other animals at digging holes, but I was...

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 Do you mean with our hands?

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 No, sorry, because we've built those amazing machinery.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 So other animals don't go that far into the ground.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 That feels a bit unfair, Ben.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
 That's like saying we fly better than any animal, because we have the world.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 True as well.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000
 Yeah.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 I was just surprised at the animal that has dug the second deepest, aside from us.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 And I think it's cool and terrifying.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000
 Oh, what is it?

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 What is it?

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000
 A Nile crocodile.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000
 Yes.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000
 What?

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 It's cool that they go...

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 With those little arms.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 They actually do it terrifyingly with their jaws, apparently.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000
 Really?

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 And they've gone down 12 metres, which is...

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 That's quite a lot less than us.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 Yeah, it does sound terrifying.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
 It's a distant second place, isn't it?

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
 Is it because they realised sooner that there wasn't nice appellee stuff down there than we did?

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 Deepest hole in Newcastle?

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 It's... I'm not going to answer that, in fact.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 Nice.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 But there is an official deepest hole in Newcastle.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
 It is. It's just outside St James's Park, isn't it?

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 The fact is just down there.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 It's just the other side of this.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000
 The science one.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 The one that's 2,000 metres.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 Really?

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
 The Newcastle Science Central deep geothermal borehole.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 They wanted to dig a geothermal hole, you know, dig down.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 Right.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 You've got free hot water forever.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
 And that's near St James's Park.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 Andy, another hole and James connection.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 I'm back on board, baby!

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
 The last one wasn't really a hole connection.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 There's much as a sandcastle connection.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 I'm back out, baby.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 I just... I love...

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 I found a headline in the local newspaper.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000
 Is it The Chronicle?

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 What has the borehole done for Newcastle?

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
 Conclusion was very little, sadly.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 Well, it gave us...

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
 It made us know that Newcastle,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 many, many million years ago, was a tropical environment.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 Mmm.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 I don't know what you can do with that information.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 Right.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 But maybe that's why people in Newcastle go with their tops off all the time,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
 because they're harkening to a better time.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000
 Long memory.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
 Just, I have a hole digger, a favourite hole digger person.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 Who is it?

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 Well, I realised, as I said that,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 that it's actually somebody who specifically didn't dig his own holes.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000
 He had holes dug for him.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 OK.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 But it's Bernard Clevo,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000
 who I...

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 It's one of my favourite people,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 because I'm quite into medieval Christian sects,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
 and he was the founder of the Knights Templars.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000
 She said sect.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 Oh, it was sect.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000
 Yeah.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000
 It was sect.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 That's a hell of a Tinder profile, isn't it?

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 Yeah.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 I'm really into medieval sects.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
 I own my own Wimple.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 Right.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
 I will bring my own root scrape.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 Yeah.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 We're all having to readjust now

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 to just be interested in what you're about to say,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 as opposed to what we were hoping you were going to say.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 I know, picturing sort of monks with dildos.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 OK.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000
 Coming around.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 OK, Anna.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 Did you have a fact here?

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 Oh, yes, sorry.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 Bernard Clevo.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 Yeah, co-founder of the Knights Templar.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 He was this Albert, a very, very leading Christian thinker.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 And this just goes to show what good friends will do.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
 So the fellow monks at the monastery absolutely adored him.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 He was their spiritual leader.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
 They knew that he was so devout that he went to excessive lengths.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 He went to excessive fasting.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
 So he would starve himself, basically, to show his devoutness.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 And that caused gastric problems.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 But he was so busy praying in the chapel that he never

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 wanted to leave until the last minute.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 So he could never get to the loon time.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
 So his monks kept on digging and re-digging him a poo hole

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
 just outside the chapel so that he could dash out

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 the last minute, drop the cassock, you know,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 plop in there and dash back in.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 And that's, if that's not friendship.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 That's friendship.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 That's beautiful.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 I was going to quickly, there's lots of different types of holes.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 So I was going to do a very quick quiz to see

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 if you could guess what these holes are.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000
 So here's the first one.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 Yule hole.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 What's a little hole?

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 Christmas hole.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 It's the opposite of a Christmas tree.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 You just dig a nice yule hole.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 If you can't afford a tree, trees are expensive.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 You just throw the tinsel in the hole.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 Lovely.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 Yeah.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 He's got it right.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 So, that's obviously not right.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
 So a yule hole is, I saw this from Susie Dent on Twitter.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
 It's a term for the loosest notch on your belt

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 reserved for Christmas feasting so that when you put

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
 a bit of extra on, you can use the yule hole in your belt.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 That's great.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 Ass holes.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 Come on.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 What are those?

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 Donkey, donkey holes in the holes for donkeys.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 Yeah.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 It's donkey holes.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 That's amazing.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 It's not a donkey's asshole.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000
 It's not an ass asshole.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 It is out in the desert areas.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
 Donkeys make holes that create desert streams

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
 and they provide water holes.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 They're not called ass holes.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000
 They are called ass holes.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 This was in a scientific paper that I read.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000
 Wow.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000
 Scientific paper.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 Come on.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000
 Yeah.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 It's a remarkable thing because not only does it feed

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 the donkeys, the horses and their predators,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 up to 57 other species go and sip from these ass holes.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 But then when they dry up, they become nurseries

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 for germination.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 No.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 You're not sending your kid to the asshole nursery.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 And it's time for fact number two.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 That is Andy.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
 My fact is that during the Hundred Years' War,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
 every goose in England had to donate six feathers

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 to the war effort.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 So, Hundred Years' War, England, France.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 Very exciting.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:34.000
 I mean, as far as wars go, it was a long one.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
 Long periods of inactivity.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000
 Yeah.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000
 Hundred and sixteen years.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 Mostly dull.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
 But during the hot bits of the war,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 England needed enormous numbers of goose feathers

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
 because they needed enormous numbers of arrows.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 So, obviously, English Army mostly archer-based at the time,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 like at Agincourt, 80% of the troops there were archers.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 And, you know, in 1421, the government had to buy half a million arrows.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
 And all of them needed goose feathers to put at the blunt end

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
 to help the arrows fly through the air

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 and hopefully, like, ooh, a Frenchman.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 So, that was the whole name of the game.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 And where are the geese?

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 You know, what a nightmare to organise.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 But fortunately, pretty much every village in England

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 had a flock of geese just hanging around the village pond.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
 And in 1417, King Henry V ordered that his sheriffs take six feathers

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 from every goose of the land and deliver them to the Tower of London.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 So, this was a way that...

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 So, did they send all those sheriffs out to all the towns just plucking cubs?

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 I guess the sheriffs were...

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
 Yeah, they might have sent under sheriffs or whatever.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
 But it was a huge endeavour.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 And, you know, like, Battle of Cressy, 1436...

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 Oh, 1346, sorry, so way earlier than this.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 But the English archers on the day fired half a million arrows in one day.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 80 per archer.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 It's a lot.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000
 It's so many feathers.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 Yeah, they've got orders of, like, a million feathers

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
 from, like, one area of England that they need.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 I mean, because also, when you're building an arrow,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 it's not just the feathers, obviously.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
 You need the wood in order to make the stick bit

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 between the plunt and the sharp bits.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 You need...

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 That's vital.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 Yeah, and by the way, there was someone who was designated

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
 the official gatherer of all the sticks that sat in the arrow.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 What?

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 He was given the ability to just walk into any forest in the UK

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 and commandeer it.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 No.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 I'm commandeering your forest.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 Oh, I thought you meant he was given the right to look

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 for good-looking sticks on the ground.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 That one's fantastic.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 I think his job meant he could go anywhere in the UK

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
 and point at a stick, and it was that stick that was now his.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
 Did they not just get bigger bits of wood and whittle them down?

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
 Because they just have to look for exactly the right stick.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 No, no, no.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
 He could chop down trees, and he could do whatever he wanted.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 That's very cool.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000
 That's very cool.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 Yeah, because they also needed the wood for the bows as well, didn't they?

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000
 And it was illegal, actually, to make clogs out of ash for that time.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
 You weren't allowed to make wooden shoes, because they needed it for the bows.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000
 Oh, really?

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 Presumably, at the time, it was one of the most fun things you could do

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
 was make some clogs out of ash, so that was a sacrifice.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 It's a different time.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
 I think this is a good theory that, basically, geese were way more important

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 to the war effort than, for example, horses.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
 If you didn't have horses, you know, like a war.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 Let me ask you, who is collecting the sticks for the arrows?

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 Really, it's that guy's dog, isn't it?

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 So surely that's where dogs collecting sticks came from, the origin.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000
 It may be.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.000
 It's a team effort.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 Well, they had to get the arrows to the battlefield as well.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
 So they were often taken by horses.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 They would have huge wagons there, because each archer could shoot

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 for about five minutes or so with the arrows that they had.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 And then they had to get more arrows,

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
 because you can't just bring them all to the front, right?

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 And so there was a wagon there, and they always had, like,

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 a battalion of young boys who would run to the wagon,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 grab the arrows, and run to the front to give the arrows to the archers.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
 That's a cool job to have.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 Would you bring emergency geese with you on the battlefield?

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000
 Oh, almost.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 Certainly every archer would have two or three geese just in his back pocket.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 You're saying that, like, you're joking.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 No, I don't think you would.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 But surely when you run out of arrows and you need to emergency make a new one,

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 I think the process of making an arrow is so time consuming.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 It's like saying, would you have a bullet maker on the battlefield

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 in case you ran out of arrows?

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 Yeah, once you ran out of arrows, that's the end of the battle.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 You just go home.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 Well, I guess you go collect them, right? If they've worked.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 It's not like darts, where once they're in the board,

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 then you pop over and you pluck them out.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 Stop them all, everyone, just collect the arrows, and then we'll do it again.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 Do we know how pedantic they were about the goose feathers?

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:40.000
 Because I read that traditionally it had to be feathers from the male goose

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 that were on the outside of the arrow.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 And then the two stabilizing feathers had to be from the female.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 And I think there was a rumour that this made it fly better,

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 but I think it was irrelevant. That was just the tradition.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000
 And I'm not sure you could tell.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 So I wonder how pedantic Mr. Sheriff was.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 I imagine at the start of the war they were quite pedantic.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000
 And by year 115, they were probably like any old feather will do.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 Because actually I think it was, most people did use goose feathers,

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 but if you were really fashionable, you might use a peacock feather in your arm.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
 That is classy, isn't it?

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 You know you've been shot by an aristocrat.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 When you look there, you see a peacock feather sticking out of you.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 Oh, fancy.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 Was this the kind of the final last hurrah for the goose war effort?

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 Yeah, it probably was the last big effort.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 Major time where it was like the dominating thing.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000
 Because they were starting to bring in right at the end, at about 1430,

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000
 there were battles going on where cannons were starting to be used.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000
 But it was quite funny reading the accounts, because they were quite shit back then.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 So there was a battle where the Duke of Burgundy fired 412 cannonballs into a town

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 and only succeeded in killing one chicken.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000
 Quick, get all the feathers!

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 I think goose feathers were used a bit later for fuses.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:04.000
 Because the hard bit of the feather is hollow,

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000
 you could kind of stick it in and put gunpowder in it and set fire to it and then run away.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000
 That's nice.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 Pretty sure that was true.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000
 Oh, that's nice that they sort of stayed useful, that's lovely.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 Because geese are big players in the world of human history.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 Everything that was written between about 600 and 1800 AD.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.000
 It was done by a goose.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 Yes, a very patient goose.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 No, but the quills that we used to write, they were pretty much all goose.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 You could use a peacock or a swan or whatever.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 But isn't it crazy as well that you can get left-handed and right-handed quills

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 based on which wing you took the quill off?

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:49.000
 Yeah, it's much nicer if you're left-handed to use a right wing of a goose and vice versa,

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 because of the way that it curves.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 But I hadn't realised that the reason the demand was so huge was that they didn't last very long at all,

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
 because I guess you're shuffling them all the time, so you're lucky if your quill lasts a week.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 If you're having a big letter, if it's someone's birthday, then your quill's going to last a couple of days.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 Actually, I suppose you only write one birthday card, don't you?

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
 Yeah, it's Christmas.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
 It's Christmas, thank you. It's Jesus' birthday.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 But where we get penknife from, the word penknife, it's a knife to make a pen from a feather,

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000
 which I had never, I'd just never made that kind of thought.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 I think the word pen might come from feather.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000
 It certainly does, penna.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000
 One of my favourite etymologies, pen and pencil, come from completely different routes,

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000
 because yeah, penna comes from feather, going back to Latin,

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 whereas pencil comes through Old French from, I think a word that means little penis.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000
 I think you're right.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 Really? Okay.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 Yeah.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 That is good.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 Totally different etymologies.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 My favourite is that assholes comes from the...

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.000
 No.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 My favourite is, does anyone know why ducks are called ducks?

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 It's because they duck.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.000
 I only learned this the other day.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 That's absolutely incredible.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 It's like, because they duck under water, everyone was like, oh, duck, duck, duck, duck, and it's duck.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000
 So humans were ducking sort of before ducks were ducking?

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 The words, as in the words, yeah.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000
 I mean, ducks were ducking from...

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 Oh, yeah, of course, yeah.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 What did we call them before? Just nothing.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 We're just like, I can't even acknowledge that.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 And there was a few different...

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 One thing we used to call them assfeeds, didn't we, ducks?

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 Did we?

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000
 Yeah, because they're always flapping their feet underneath their ass.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 Oh, because when they're ducking, they've also got their bum sticking out of the water.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 Yeah, yeah, anyway.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 But we're not talking about ducks, we're talking about geese.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000
 Let's talk about golf.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 Let's talk about golf, because goose feathers were used in golf balls.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 Oh, really?

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000
 For a long time, actually.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000
 And that was kind of what kept posh people playing golf and non-posh people not playing golf,

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 because they were so expensive.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 And the balls were so expensive, they were even more expensive than the clubs in those days.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.000
 Okay.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000
 And the way you would do it is you would get a load of goose feathers,

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000
 and you would put it in some cow hide or something,

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000
 and then you would soak it all.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.000
 And that made the leather get smaller, but it would make the goose's feathers get bigger.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000
 And that kind of made a really, really solid ball.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 And it was a perfect ball for playing golf.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 Did they bounce those ones?

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000
 You don't really need your golf ball to bounce.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 Okay.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000
 They didn't bounce as much.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 You're thinking of basketballs.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 Oh, no.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000
 But when you were making these golf balls,

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 every golf ball had a top hat full of feathers in it.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000
 That was how you would measure how many feathers you needed to get a top hat,

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000
 fill it with feathers, and that was the right amount.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000
 So they're really shrinking down.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.000
 Very whimsical.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.000
 Wow.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000
 I've got a riddle for you.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 "The USA hoarded 1.5 million pounds of goose feathers in a strategic reserve."

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 Why?

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.000
 Pillow fights?

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.000
 No.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 No.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 Okay.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000
 They say it again.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 They had it all in one, like, building.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000
 Well, I don't know about the exact administrative distribution

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 of the 1.5 million pounds of goose feathers.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000
 They might have needed a few sheds or whatever.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.000
 A hole?

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.000
 Could have been in an asshole.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.000
 No, we're not making asshole a thing, it's not happening.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.000
 Why?

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000
 Why?

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000
 I'm trying to set a guess.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000
 Is this for when we go back to the olden days

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000
 and we have to rely on bow and arrows

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000
 because the nuclear blast has wiped out our guns?

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000
 Nice guess.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.000
 It's actually for if we need to go somewhere cold.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000
 It's just to make down...

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 To make two bags.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 To fill, it's basically sleeping bags

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000
 and boots and Arctic weather kit.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000
 It's if suddenly we need to fight in the Arctic.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000
 So you just have the strategic reserves in case...

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 So when James said pillow, he was right.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.000
 No, no.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.000
 He said James said pillow fights.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000
 Completely different thing.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000
 Frivolous in times of war.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000
 Well...

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000
 Well, that's interesting.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000
 Anyway, just that was part of the...

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000
 And are they not there anymore?

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000
 So is it worth attacking Alaska is what I'm asking.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000
 Certainly is.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000
 Guys, I need to move us on.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000
 Do you want to sneak in anything before we...

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000
 Another use for a goose.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.000
 I'm sure you guys know this.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 But Rabalé wrote in Gargantua,

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000
 "I wiped my arse with a hen, with a cock,

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000
 "with a calfskin, with a..."

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.000
 Come on.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000
 "With a hair, with a pigeon, with a cormorant,

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000
 "with Naterni's bag..."

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.000
 What's Naterni's bag?

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000
 "But of all the tortures, arse wisps,

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000
 "bumfodders, tail napkins, bunkhole cleansers,

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 "there is none in the world comparable to the neck of a goose."

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000
 How big of a vindaloo are this guy's hats?

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.000
 They took all of that.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000
 Oh, goose.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:35.000
 All right, we are going to move on to fact number three.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 It is time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000
 My fact this week is that American comedian Lucille Ball's teeth

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 could play the latest pop songs and bust Japanese spies.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 Wow.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 If you were around Lucille Ball at the right moment,

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000
 if you stuck your ear to her mouth, you could hear...

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 You could hear the latest pop songs.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000
 So stupid.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000
 But it's true.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000
 Was she singing them?

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.000
 She wasn't singing them.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000
 No, it was legit the pop song.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 So 1952, she was filming a movie.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000
 "Dubare" was a lady with Red Skelton.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000
 This was during World War II,

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 and she had recently just had some temporary lead fillings

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000
 put into her teeth, and as she drove home from the MGM studio,

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 she said, "One night I came into the valley and I heard music.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 I reached down and turned the radio off, and it wasn't on.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000
 The music kept getting louder and louder,

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000
 and then I realized it was coming from my mouth.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000
 I even recognized the tune.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000
 My mouth was humming and thumping with drumbeats,

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000
 and I thought I was losing my mind.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.000
 I thought, "What the hell is this?"

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000
 Then it started to subside.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.000
 I got home, went to bed,

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000
 not sure if I should tell anyone what happened

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000
 because they would think I was crazy.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 Anyway, she told this to Buster Keaton, the comedian,

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.000
 who she was good friends with,

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 and he said that she was picking up on radio broadcasts

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.000
 through her fillings,

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 and that the same thing had happened to a friend of his,

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000
 and a lot of people were reporting this at the time,

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000
 and then she suddenly heard, coming through her teeth,

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:13.000
 and she reported it to someone, and that person said,

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.000
 "That could be Japanese spies who were trying to send water reach."

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 It could have been just the start of Inspector Moss.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 Your lead fillings get radioed.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000
 You need some metal in there,

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000
 which is going to receive the radio waves,

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000
 and then you need something in there

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000
 that's not quite solid that can vibrate,

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000
 and the radio waves will make that vibrate

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 and will make the sound come through.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000
 Because it has happened in history.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000
 There's an example in the American Journal of Psychiatry,

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000
 where a 35-year-old war veteran thought he was hearing voices,

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 but it turned out he was getting a local radio station.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000
 There was a 65-year-old man who had hip replacements,

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000
 and the doctor was checking his feet,

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000
 and so put his stethoscope to his feet

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000
 and could hear Taylor Swift or whatever it was.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000
 It was vibrating through his hip replacements.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 That's brilliant.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000
 Has it ever been loud enough that if you're like,

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000
 "Oh, I can't quite get the signal for a glass of FM,"

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000
 you can say, "Let's go round to Barry's house."

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000
 Gather around and grant her a tip.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000
 That's really funny.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.000
 This is a field of study at the moment,

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000
 so the US Army has just got the molar mic, Raphon,

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000
 which is a radio that clips onto your tooth, basically,

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000
 and it transmits these signals through your jawbone.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000
 So the sound goes into your jaw

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000
 and just goes straight to your auditory nerve.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000
 So you can hear a big advantage.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 You don't have to wear a microphone

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000
 if you're up to your neck in a swamp or whatever,

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000
 and they are testing us at the moment.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000
 That's actually weirdly.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000
 We talked about Beethoven on last week's episode,

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 and I don't think we mentioned that his friend designed for him

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000
 something like that, didn't he?

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000
 When Beethoven went deaf, he designed a contraption

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 that he put on his jaw against his jaw

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000
 that conducted sound for him

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000
 so that he could hear better what he was playing,

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000
 and it attached to his piano.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000
 Didn't he have to bite his piano to hear it?

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000
 I think he did have to bite down on the piano, yes.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000
 That was the prototype, him biting.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 And then his friend was like, "I'll make you a straw, mate."

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000
 Yeah, and built like a metal rod.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 Wow.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000
 Just so that in case anyone doesn't recognize the name Lucy O'Ball,

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 I'm talking about "I Love Lucy,"

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000
 one of the greatest comedians of all time.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 I mean, quite often voted the greatest

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000
 American TV comedian of all time.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000
 "I Love Lucy" was the sitcom that she made, right?

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000
 Yeah, yeah. She was incredible.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000
 She's going to have her day very soon

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000
 where she gets that second wind of championation.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000
 She actually died 30 years ago.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000
 I don't know why Dan thinks she's going to get a second wind.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000
 No, I mean, I did like...

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000
 Someone's going to say she's my favorite

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000
 and we're all going to watch her movies again and so on.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000
 Dan's new podcast, "I Love Lucy."

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:48.000
 Which is entirely in Morse code, only receivable by teeth.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 I didn't realize how cute she was.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000
 So there was a thing of,

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000
 in one of the shows,

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000
 her character gives birth.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000
 And I think it was the first time

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000
 any American TV had shown

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000
 a pregnant woman going to hospital

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000
 as a character.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000
 44 million people watched that.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000
 Yeah, it's insane.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000
 Stunning, crazy numbers.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000
 72% of American homes.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000
 America used to shut down on a Monday night

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 because that was the night it was broadcast.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
 And weirdly, in that episode,

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000
 she gave birth the same night that her character

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000
 gave birth on TV.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 Not that weirdly because she booked

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000
 in a caesarean for that day.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000
 Yeah.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000
 So "I Love Lucy" was possibly

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 the first major TV comedy

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000
 that was pre-recorded.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000
 Up until then, you were doing live TV,

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000
 everything went out live.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 And she and her husband, Desi,

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000
 they innovated the multi-camera

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000
 live audience pre-record.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000
 So when that show did go out,

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000
 it was timed so that she would give birth

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 on the same night.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000
 But what's amazing as well is Andy,

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 not only was it the first time they saw someone

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000
 going to deliver a baby,

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000
 but they couldn't even use the word "pregnancy"

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000
 on the show.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000
 So the episode wasn't called "Lucy is Pregnant",

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 it was called "Lucy is Enciente"

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000
 because that's a...

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 What's that?

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 Well, it's a different word for pregnant.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 I forgot to write which language down.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000
 I assume it'll be Spanish because

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000
 it's Cuban.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000
 And I think whenever they refer

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000
 to pregnancy, they would say she was expecting.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000
 They would never say she was pregnant.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000
 It's mad, it's like it was a swear word.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000
 It's absolutely bizarre. Did no one know

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000
 about pregnancy then?

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000
 Actually, one of the facts that someone

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000
 in the audience sent to us today

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000
 said something like...

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000
 I think it was 1974

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000
 and it was the formula one.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000
 And they refused to show it on the BBC

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000
 because one of the teams was sponsored

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000
 and all the other teams were sponsored

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 by cigarette brands.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000
 And they were like, "No, no, condoms.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000
 Definitely can't have that on our TV."

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000
 Yeah, and when they did

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000
 the pregnancy announcement script as well,

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000
 they had to, because in

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000
 TV land, often you have to give it

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 to people who are looking to see if there's anything

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 that can be offensive. So the BBC have...

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000
 James, what's it called when they have to have a pass

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000
 through it to make sure it's okay?

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000
 Spoilspot.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000
 Yeah, that basically.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000
 Compliance. The compliance was not only done

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000
 by someone who was in-house, part of the network,

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000
 but it had to be handed to a priest, a rabbi.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 No. And they themselves

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000
 are a joke as well.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000
 Look, we're all going with the big question about Lucy.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000
 Lucille, was she a communist?

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000
 Oh. She was accused of being a communist.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000
 Was she? Yeah, and she was registered to vote

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 as a communist. Oh, so that says

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
 she's a communist. Yeah, it does.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000
 People claimed, people said they went to her house

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000
 to have communist meetings, didn't they?

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000
 But she did insist that she wasn't a communist.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000
 She said she was basically hauled

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000
 over the coals in 1952 by the McCarthyite

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000
 when the sort of commie

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000
 hunting fever was at its absolute height.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 And, you know, she gave evidence, she said,

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000
 "Yes, I was registered to vote as a communist

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000
 in the '30s, but it was only to please

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000
 my elderly grandfather." Very good.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000
 Exclusive Stalin.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 I love Lenin.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000
 There was a movie about Lucille Ball, wasn't there

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000
 quite recently, and there's a big scene in that

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000
 where her husband

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000
 comes out in front of the audience

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000
 and says she's not a communist.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000
 And he said, "The only thing

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000
 read about Lucy is her hair,

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000
 and even that's not legitimate."

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000
 That's very good. Very good.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000
 It was an amazing relationship, must have been quite,

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000
 I don't know, we all get excited

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000
 by celebrity relationships. Well, I don't,

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000
 because I'm above it, but many do.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000
 They were one of the originals.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000
 Desi Arnaz was her husband. They'd been together

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000
 for ten years when they made "I Love Lucy,"

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 and they played husband and wife in that.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000
 They sort of played versions of their own characters, didn't they?

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000
 And it must have been quite groundbreaking then,

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000
 because he was a Cuban migrant,

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000
 and she was this ginger person,

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000
 the TV station said at the time...

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000
 It's hardly been seen on TV before.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000
 A Cuban and a ginger.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000
 They had to call her

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000
 Strawberry Blond, didn't they?

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000
 I remember TV was black

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000
 and white back then as well.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000
 It's more the fact she was white, isn't it?

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 No, they kept on quoting,

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000
 "No one's going to believe that a pale redhead

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000
 "is going to go out with a Cuban."

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000
 Maybe it was like, "Is she dark hair?"

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000
 You know, maybe it's slightly more plausible.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000
 Anyway, there was lots of fuss about it,

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000
 but they were an amazing relationship,

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000
 and they did divorce, but they stayed very good friends.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000
 But he was interesting as well, Desi Arnaz,

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000
 and he gave us the conga.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000
 Did he?

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000
 What do you mean he gave it to us?

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000
 He basically introduced the conga line

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000
 to the West.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000
 He started, and then another person got behind him

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.000
 before he knew it, the entire population of America.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000
 Yeah, yeah, America came to a standstill for years.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000
 That is a big one, isn't it?

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000
 It's a big one, and that's obviously not how it started,

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000
 but it was a big thing in Cuba,

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000
 so Cubans in America tended to know about it.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.000
 His father had been mayor of Santiago de Cuba in the '20s,

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000
 and actually his father had repeatedly tried to ban the conga

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000
 for being immoral and dangerous and sexy.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000
 Which it is.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000
 Which it is!

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000
 But he then set up a club.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000
 It's the sexiest dance I know.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000
 I don't know about you guys.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000
 It depends where the conga goes into, isn't it?

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000
 Yeah, I don't know.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000
 It doesn't go into anything!

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000
 Do you mean which room it goes into?

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000
 If you keep it in the kitchen, it's not sexy.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000
 If it goes into the sex dungeon...

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.000
 I think a conga makes a sex dungeon unsexy

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000
 rather than the other way round.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000
 Oh, man, I'd be so terrified if I was halfway along the conga,

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000
 and I saw them going into the sex dungeon.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000
 You can't change the course of the conga.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000
 You can't do it.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.000
 We just start walking quicker, so we get through the sex dungeon faster,

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000
 and hopefully back out into the billiard's room or something normal.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000
 Are you ever allowed to jump in front of a conga to avert crisis?

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000
 You're not allowed to speed...

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000
 No, but you can exert subtle pressure from behind.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000
 Like, let's crack on.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000
 Can we just...

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000
 Pressure from behind is what they want.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000
 Oh, no!

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000
 I started the sex dungeon party!

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000
 Oh, no!

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000
 Anyway...

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000
 Are we talking about Lucille Ball?

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000
 He started a club.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000
 He started making clear a club called the conga,

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000
 where he introduced conga dancing.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.000
 And that's how it came to us, so thank you.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000
 Thank you, Desi. Here's something we've got to thank,

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.000
 largely Lucille, but also Desi for.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000
 It is thanks to her that we have Star Trek.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000
 Star Trek exists because of Lucille Ball.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.000
 So, Jean Roddenbury had pitched the idea to quite a few productions.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.000
 Jean Roddenbury being the founder/creator of Star Trek,

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000
 and not many people wanted it.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000
 Lucille said this sounds fantastic.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000
 There's a rumour that she misunderstood what it was,

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.000
 because she thought it was celebrities going on treks, basically.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000
 Star Trek.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000
 It was at a time where Bob Hope was going with USO members

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000
 to the war zones, and it was a big Star Power thing.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000
 That's a great name for a show.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000
 Star Trek, right?

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000
 Star Trek's about to show, arguably.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000
 But then she...

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000
 She then found out what it was about,

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000
 and she said, "This sounds very good."

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000
 They made a pilot that was rejected,

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000
 and she said, "Let's give it another pilot."

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.000
 And it was the second pilot that allowed for Star Trek to be made.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000
 And she did that with Mission Impossible as well,

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000
 and a number of other shows.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000
 The old one, which I actually didn't know was a thing.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.000
 Anna.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.000
 I'm so sorry!

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000
 It's like you don't listen to me at all!

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.000
 (LAUGHTER)

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000
 Yeah, the TV series, Mission Impossible.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.000
 Yeah.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.000
 Very good.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000
 Well, not only was she a nerd, she was a jerk.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.000
 Yes, I heard that too.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.000
 Yes.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000
 The soda jerk.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000
 Oh.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000
 I just heard she was an unpleasant person to work with.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000
 Okay, in the 20s and the 50s, it was this huge phenomenon.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000
 I didn't know how big a deal it was,

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000
 so it was in drugstores, chemists, basically.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000
 But they had soda fountains there,

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000
 and you'd have the soda jerk working the soda fountain,

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000
 called that because they jerk the handle

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000
 as they're giving it to you.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000
 But they weren't really, that wasn't their job.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000
 Their main job was to be an entertainer.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000
 And they were all about punning, wordplay,

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.000
 making up crazy new terms for these drinks.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000
 You'd order, like, a cherry Coke,

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000
 and they'd shout, "Stretch one, paint it red!"

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000
 And that means they want a cherry Coke.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.000
 Wow.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000
 Aren't they also the one making the drink?

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.000
 No.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.000
 Who are they shouting this to?

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000
 Yeah, I think there's another soda jerk behind them,

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000
 who's doing a bit of the back and forth.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000
 Okay, okay, a bit of business.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000
 You'd order a Mary Garden.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.000
 Mary Garden was a famous singer,

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000
 and you ordered a Mary Garden because it made you sing,

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000
 and that was the drink where you wanted them to spike it

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.000
 with laxatives because you're blocked up

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000
 and you needed to have some diarrhea.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.000
 Oh, my God!

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000
 That, you know what?

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000
 That sounds mad, but I do think that is missing

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000
 from modern cocktail bars, where...

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.000
 And if you could just pull off a couple of the old

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000
 shit-a-roonies in there, that would be...

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:54.000
 It is time for our final fact of the show,

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.000
 and that is James.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.000
 Okay, my fact this week is that the smelliest car

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000
 at the British Motor Museum

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.000
 belongs to Queen Elizabeth II.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.000
 Are you allowed to make those sort of accusations?

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000
 It's not an accusation, it's a fact.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000
 That's all we do on this show, we do facts.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000
 What are some of us?

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.000
 I'm...

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000
 I'm going to guess that it smelled of corgi.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000
 Oh, okay.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000
 It just had constant corgis all the way through it.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.000
 Okay, well, the people who smelled it...

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000
 dealt it.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000
 No, the people who smelled it said,

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000
 "It's not a terribly nice smell, but it is very interesting.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.000
 "It has an almost cheesy, fatty smell to it."

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000
 Ooh, is that Philip?

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.000
 No, so let me just explain how we know this.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.000
 So, there is a guy at York University called Dr. Will Tullet,

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.000
 and he's head of the British part

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000
 of a European research programme into smell,

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000
 and they're trying to find lots of old smells

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000
 and kind of save them before they disappear.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.000
 And they ask people what kind of smells are you worried

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000
 are going to disappear, and a lot of people are worried

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.000
 that the old smell of cars is going to disappear,

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000
 because now we're all going electric,

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000
 there's not going to be any petrol cars,

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000
 cars are going to change, the smell is going to change,

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.000
 we're going to miss those old cheesy smells of cars.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.000
 And so they thought, well, we need to find the smell of an old car,

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.000
 so what should we do?

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000
 We'll go to Gaydon in Warwickshire,

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000
 which is where the British Motor Museum is,

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.000
 and we'll say, "Where is your smelliest car, please?"

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000
 And they said, "Well, without doubt,

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000
 "the smelliest one is this Rover from the 1970s

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.000
 "that belonged to the Queen."

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.000
 That's very interesting, because there's this thing about the Queen

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.000
 that supposedly she thought the world smelled of fresh paint,

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.000
 because everywhere she goes, it's just been painted fresh

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000
 for her arrival, so she just smells this all the time.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000
 So it might have been a reaction to that.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000
 And also, this had a thick carpet added to it.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000
 I presume for royal luxury.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.000
 That's absolutely right.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000
 It had a thick, curly pile carpet,

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.000
 and it also had windows that were sealed,

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.000
 in case there was a gas attack out there, they wouldn't go.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.000
 Oh, so it keeps the smell in.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000
 Basically, the smell stayed in there

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000
 because they got into the carpet and they stayed in there

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.000
 and they couldn't escape because all the windows were sealed.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:11.000
 So it could be some occupant just let off a huge fart,

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000
 shut the door straight away,

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.000
 and it just hasn't been able to get out ever since,

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.000
 until these people enter.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.000
 I'm sure it was the Coggies that did that.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000
 But anyway, if you are interested,

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000
 then in 2023 they produced some car fresheners

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000
 with the royal car smell.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.000
 Really?

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000
 So you can get a little tree in your car.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000
 They'll give you the smell of the smelly Queen's car.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.000
 That's so good.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000
 I would just, while we're mentioning the modifications

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000
 that were made to her car,

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000
 we know that the presidential car, the beast,

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000
 has things like it has blood in it

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.000
 of the president in case there's an assassination

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.000
 they need to administer abroad.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.000
 Really?

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000
 Yeah, there's all sorts of modifications to the car.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000
 And I thought surely any time the Queen had a car,

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.000
 they pimped the car.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000
 So there's that, the windows.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.000
 There's also, in between the two front seats,

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000
 there was a little tray that pulled out

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.000
 that allowed her to put her handbag onto the tray,

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.000
 just in the middle of her.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.000
 Yeah.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.000
 I just remembered, I've seen the Queen's car.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.000
 Oh yeah?

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.000
 I walked past her once.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.000
 Was she in it?

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.000
 No.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000
 Were you in the Gaiden multi-museum?

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.000
 No, I wasn't.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.000
 It was just, she was visiting the university I was at.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000
 And were you blown away by the car smell?

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000
 Did you sort of have to cross the street?

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.000
 No, it wasn't a rover.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.000
 It was one of the posh cars.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.000
 It was a sort of, I don't know, Bentley or something.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000
 But it was, but it has the special huge,

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.000
 you know how some cars have the little sticky upy Mercedes thing?

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.000
 The Queen's car had a massive St. George

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000
 and the dragon silver thing on the bonnet.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.000
 Did you see it?

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.000
 Yeah.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.000
 It was quite cool.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.000
 I think that was unique.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.000
 Yeah.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.000
 And does the King get any of this shit?

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000
 Or is it just like, we've stopped caring?

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.000
 I think King does.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:44.000
 Well, doesn't he use wine for petrol?

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.000
 Wine and cheese.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.000
 Wine and trees.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000
 Just general smells, of course.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.000
 So the little pine tree thing that they put in cars,

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.000
 like the classic car freshener, was debuted in 1952,

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.000
 which is actually the year the Queen became the Queen, isn't it?

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000
 Oh yeah, she coronated in '53.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.000
 But she did, yeah.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000
 Anyway, she didn't invent it.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.000
 But that was not initially in the shape of a Christmas tree

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.000
 or a pine tree.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000
 Do you know what it was originally in the shape of?

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.000
 Oh.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.000
 Oh gosh.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.000
 Something smelly.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.000
 A candle.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.000
 No.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.000
 It was, I'm afraid, a sexy, pin-up model woman.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.000
 Was it?

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.000
 Was it?

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.000
 Yeah.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.000
 Was it with a big bottom, though, that could be farting?

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000
 Because it was the era of those postcards on the beach.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000
 No, it wasn't invented in Bogner.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.000
 No, it was in...

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:32.000
 You know those World War II planes,

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000
 and you'd paint a sexy woman on the side of your plane?

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000
 You know that kind of fetty boom?

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.000
 Kind of pin-up.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.000
 Yeah, the pin-up thing.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.000
 That was the shape of the first.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000
 It was a chemist called Julius Semen.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.000
 Julius Semen?

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000
 Yeah, say that surname again.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.000
 Semen, it sort of finished.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.000
 He's got an accent I don't know how to pronounce.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000
 He bumped into a milkman recently who said,

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000
 "My truck smells of spilt milk all the time,

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.000
 and it's horrible.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000
 It clings to the truck.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.000
 Can you invent something?"

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000
 And he said, "Yeah, I'll go and invent the pine-centred thing."

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.000
 He just shaped it instead of shaping it like a pine tree.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.000
 The obvious thing to shape it like,

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.000
 because it was the fifties,

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000
 he shaped it like a sexy woman instead.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000
 Wow, Milty is the worst scent.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.000
 According to professional scent removers,

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000
 the worst scent to remove, yes.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000
 Worse than, like, vomit, versus...

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000
 I think it's just more common than vomit, to be fair.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000
 There are a lot of smells that will tell you

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.000
 if there's something wrong with your car.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000
 So I went onto one of those websites of Garage

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.000
 who told you all the different things.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.000
 So, burning smell.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000
 It means you might have burnt out fuse,

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.000
 or the air conditioning is overheated.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:27.000
 Or the cars on fire.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000
 Or the cars on fire.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.000
 Rubber burning could be your brakes

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000
 or your tyres have an issue.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000
 Or your cars on fire, I suppose.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000
 Rotten eggs means you have a problem

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000
 with your catalytic converter.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000
 Or your fuel filter.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.000
 That's the excuse I'm going to use next time.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.000
 Damn, this is an electric car.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.000
 And the end is said, a dead animal smell.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000
 This could be an animal that has crawled

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000
 into the engine and died.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000
 No, this is...

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000
 OK, one of the most annoying memories

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000
 of my childhood, and it lasted so long,

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.000
 was, um, sorry, personal anecdote.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.000
 But my brother got a pet snake, a little garter snake,

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.000
 and we picked it up from the pet shop,

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000
 drove it home, got there, opened the cage,

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000
 it wasn't in it, it had escaped in the car.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:14.000
 The cage?

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000
 I think I see what you've gone wrong.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:22.000
 Oh, yeah, he could, but he won't.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.000
 Don't worry.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.000
 Well, he did.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.000
 There's a pet's helmet who's run out of boxes.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.000
 Look, it had actually wrenched open

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.000
 the glass container that it was being kept in.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.000
 OK.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:36.000
 And it just escaped.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.000
 And it, for...

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000
 I think we kept the car for about five years after that,

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000
 and it smelled of dead snake

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000
 every time you turned on the heating or the aircon.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000
 And it was so funny, it was such a joke,

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000
 and everyone who got in our car was like,

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.000
 "Hey, it's the dead snake car."

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.000
 And it's unmistakable, a dead animal in your car.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.000
 And they do like it, because there's a lot of, like,

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000
 warm, nice nooks to climb into.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.000
 I think there was a family in Australia recently

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000
 who the dad was driving along,

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.000
 and he suddenly said, "Oh, got to pull over, pulled over."

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:08.000
 And a meter-long snake had jumped out of the air conditioning,

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.000
 the ventilation system, and tried to bite him with its head,

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.000
 and then retreated back in.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:14.000
 Yeah.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:18.000
 So Mazda in 2011 had to recall 52,000 cars,

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:21.000
 because there's a spider, which is called the yellow-sack spider,

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000
 who loved the smell of gasoline,

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000
 so they were attracted to the car,

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000
 and they would go into the vents, and they would just live there,

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000
 and then the webs that they would build up around it

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.000
 would mess up the pipes and overheat the car.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000
 So it was really dangerous.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000
 So they had to recall 52,000.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:39.000
 So there's literally a specific spring inside this model of car

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.000
 to stop spiders from making homes inside of it.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:42.000
 Wow.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.000
 That's really funny.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.000
 I'm sorry, I've been so busy trying to think of a kind of...

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000
 of the name for a snake that would live in a car.

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:49.000
 OK.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.000
 Go on then.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.000
 Where'd you go?

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:52.000
 Anahonda.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.000
 Yeah.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.000
 [APPLAUSE]

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000
 That is great.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.000
 I mean, it was my car, so it works on that level.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.000
 Oh, shit!

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.000
 Anahonda!

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000
 For God's sake, people, this is genius.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:05.000
 I meant that.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:06.000
 I meant, I missed it.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.000
 Yeah.

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:08.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:13.000
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.000
 That is it.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:15.000
 That is all of our facts.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.000
 We will see you again, Newcastle.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:20.000
 You were awesome.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:21.000
 Thank you so much for having us.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000
 We can't wait to come back again.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000
 For the rest of you, we'll see you again next week

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:26.000
 for another episode.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.000
 Goodbye!

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.000
