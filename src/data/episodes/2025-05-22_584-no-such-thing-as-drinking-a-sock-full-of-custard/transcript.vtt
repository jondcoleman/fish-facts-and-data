00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.880
 (upbeat music)

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.480
 Hi everyone, welcome to another episode of No Such Things

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.640
 of Fish.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.800
 Andrew Hunter Murray is away on holiday

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.580
 looking for rare species of moss

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.560
 or perhaps covering his entire house in solar panels.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.360
 I'm not sure what he's doing, but he's not here.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.360
 And so in his place, we have the founder of QI, John Lloyd.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.400
 Now you'll all know John because he's been on this show

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.880
 many, many times, but if you're a new listener,

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.320
 then he is, he's like a master of British comedy

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.400
 over the last 40, 50 years.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.800
 He was instrumental in things like not the nine o'clock news,

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.600
 black-hatter, QI of course, spitting image.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.240
 If you were a fan of that back in the day,

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.860
 there's a really nice anecdote later on in this episode

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.240
 where he talks about that.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.520
 Basically, he's an all-round genius

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.200
 and I'm sure you'll enjoy his talents on this week's show.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.920
 I should quickly say, because I know he would want me to,

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.080
 that his son, Harry, who is a good friend of all of us,

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.960
 he is in a band and they have a new single out.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.880
 The band is called Waiting for Smith.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.600
 So if you're interested in that,

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.080
 then go to anywhere where you get your music

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.800
 or any bit of social media search for Waiting for Smith

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.800
 and you will find all about that.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.160
 Anyway, without further ado,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.920
 let us continue with another episode

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.080
 of No Such Things as a Fish with Mr. John Lloyd

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.420
 on with a podcast.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.540
 (upbeat music)

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:38.820
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.420
 of No Such Things as a Fish,

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.100
 a weekly podcast coming to you

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.540
 from the QI offices in Hoburn.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.660
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.940
 I am sitting here with James Harkin, Anna Tyshinski

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.180
 and John Lloyd.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.500
 And once again, we have gathered round the microphones

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.140
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.380
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.620
 Starting with fact number one, that is Lloydy.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.620
 - So my fact is that Picasso inhaled his first cigar

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.260
 on the day he was born.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.540
 (laughing)

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.540
 So Picasso was born at home on the 25th of October, 1881.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.540
 He had a very difficult birth

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.100
 and he was unusually small and undeveloped.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.660
 The midwife wrote him off as stillborn.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:24.660
 - Oh no. - Right.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.740
 - And literally parked him on a side table

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.420
 while she looked after his mum.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.740
 - Right.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.420
 - And it was fortunate because Picasso's uncle,

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.100
 his father's brother, Salvador Ruiz Blasco,

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.300
 who was also a doctor, happened to be there.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.060
 And he was smoking a cigar as you do in those doors.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.620
 - Of course, yep.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.700
 - And he strode over and puffed a great waft of smoke

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.780
 into Picasso's face and the baby went,

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:48.620
 (screaming)

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.340
 - Oh really? - In a horrible face.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.180
 - Okay.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.140
 - And then he lasered a huge yell and saved his life.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.980
 - Wow. - Okay.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.540
 - So he didn't enjoy his first smoke.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.100
 Like many of us, it sounds like

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.620
 he didn't embrace it first time round.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.300
 - Well, he came round quickly

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.380
 'cause he was a lifelong smoker.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.340
 In fact, he smoked until seven years before his death,

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.140
 age 91, but tellingly, he never inhaled.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.980
 - Is that right?

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:11.820
 - So there you are.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:12.660
 - The Bill Clinton.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:13.500
 - Yeah.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.660
 (laughing)

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.580
 - Yeah, he died in 1973.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:20.420
 - Yeah.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.580
 - Which I worked out meant that he could, in theory,

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.260
 have met Pharrell Williams, the pop star.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.100
 - Okay.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.140
 - And do you think they would have got along?

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.380
 - Well, Pharrell was only three days old

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.500
 when Picasso died and for all that time,

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.020
 Pharrell was in Virginia and Picasso was in France.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.860
 So at least one of them

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.700
 would have had to make quite a lengthy trip.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:38.740
 - Yes.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:39.980
 - Or a Zoom call.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.700
 - A Zoom call, yeah.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.220
 - What are you thinking we're missing out on

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.220
 by them not meeting?

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.580
 Why them two specifically?

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:47.700
 - Well, I just think Pharrell

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.140
 is a very, very modern day name, right?

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.980
 - Yes, right.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.740
 - And Picasso, for anyone who was born

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.260
 after he died, like myself,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.500
 he feels like someone in the past.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.340
 Do you know what I mean?

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.180
 So I think it's quite surprising

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.940
 that those two could, in theory, have met.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.340
 - And, of course, Virginia, the home of tobacco,

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.940
 Virginia ready-rubbed and so on.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:04.780
 - What a good point.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:05.780
 - It would have got on really well.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:06.620
 - Yes.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.380
 (laughing)

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.900
 He was baptized Pablo Diego, Jose Francisco de Palo,

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.900
 Juan Nepum Maceno, Crispiniano Maria de los Remedios,

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.380
 de la Santissima Trinidad Rui Picasso.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.020
 - Actually not, because the priest made--

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.780
 - Well, you could have said that before I started.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.060
 (laughing)

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.820
 - The priest made a spelling mistake.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:31.660
 - Oh, did he?

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.300
 - He was supposed to be called Crispiniano,

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.420
 because St. Crispin's Day, the 25th of October,

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:37.740
 was the day he was born.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.340
 And the priest made a spelling mistake

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.820
 and called him Chipriano.

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.860
 - Chipriano, which is a brand of crisps.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.100
 (laughing)

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.540
 - His first word, there's a legend behind that,

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.900
 that his mother says, which is that it was pencil.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.460
 So he seems like a child of destiny, in a way.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.780
 Yeah, I'm not allowed to do the accent

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:59.740
 on the show anymore, John,

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.860
 so I might as well pronounce the English versions.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.420
 - Is that like for penis in Spanish as well?

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:05.260
 I think it might be.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:06.100
 - Is it?

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.380
 - Well, pencil means little penis, doesn't it, penicillus?

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.140
 - Yeah, we'll never know which he was referring to

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.540
 at the age of one and a half.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.740
 - They both could have been quite prescient, couldn't they?

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.620
 - They were sort of his two leading tools, I would say.

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.100
 (laughing)

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.540
 We should say, for anyone who's already switched off,

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.860
 'cause we're talking about Picasso,

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.420
 his reputation has taken a bit of a dive,

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:28.620
 hasn't it, the last 10 years?

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.820
 I hadn't quite realized how much his mistresses

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.860
 were in basically all of his art.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.460
 So it was sort of all about his sex life and his shagging.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.620
 And a lot of people do criticize the way

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.620
 that he exploited women and, you know,

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.260
 people say women were tools to be exploited for his art.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.740
 And he did once say, every time I change wives,

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.060
 I should burn the last one so that, you know,

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.900
 you can wipe the slate clean.

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.460
 - The last wife or the last painting?

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:53.300
 - The last wife.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.140
 - The last wife.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.980
 - Oh, okay.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.380
 And he only actually married twice,

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.580
 but I think he's referring to all his mistresses then.

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.820
 - Two types of women, he said, goddesses and doormats.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:03.660
 Yeah.

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.420
 - One of his early lovers, Francoise Chilot,

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.660
 is part of one of my favorite facts,

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.540
 which is that she later married Jonah Salk,

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.220
 who developed the polio jab.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.060
 - Oh, that's a good fact.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:14.900
 - Yeah.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.460
 - So she was basically Picasso's muse,

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.420
 and then she married this guy who saved the world

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:21.260
 a little bit really,

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.260
 'cause so many people were dying of polio in those days.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.300
 But people asked her later why she was attracted

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.220
 to such outstanding men.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:30.060
 And she replied,

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.740
 "I think I am just as interesting as they.

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.500
 "Lions mate with lions, they don't mate with mice."

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.340
 - That's very good.

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.740
 - But wasn't she the only muse who left him?

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.060
 - Yes, she was immune to his charms.

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.140
 She's such a,

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:45.580
 she's a nice person to read about

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.540
 after I suppose all these women who ended up

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.100
 according to some accounts destroyed.

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.060
 She just said, "He didn't know me very well at all.

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.140
 "I'm very secretive, I smile politely, but I don't agree.

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:57.740
 "And I didn't invest my narcissism

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.060
 "in being represented by him.

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:00.380
 "I couldn't care less."

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:01.220
 - Yeah.

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.060
 - And walked off.

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.140
 - She wrote a book about him, a very famous book,

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:03.980
 "Life with Picasso."

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.140
 I actually read it when I was like 15 years old,

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.020
 I saw it in a library, it's an amazing book.

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:10.420
 And it basically caused a lot of problems

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:11.260
 when it came out,

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.380
 because no one wanted to know this side about Picasso.

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:14.220
 When it was released,

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.260
 there were 40 intellectuals who signed a petition

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.700
 to have it banned and scrapped and pulped.

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.020
 - But were there intellectuals?

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:20.860
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:21.700
 - They thought his reputation will--

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.100
 - Yeah, including one of the major biographers

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:26.900
 who wrote numerous volumes on Picasso's life afterwards,

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.380
 saying that this should be in like a tabloid

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:30.700
 as opposed to a book shop.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:31.540
 - Is that John Richardson?

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:32.380
 - Yeah, John Richardson.

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.260
 - From A.R.10 Cats and Scatham.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:38.180
 - Yeah, he was fuming, he was furious.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:40.100
 But interestingly, she was asked about this

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:42.100
 in her 90s about this biography.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.620
 And she said, "All these men who wrote that

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.780
 had never met me, didn't know what I was talking about."

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:48.060
 And she and John Richardson became really good friends,

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:49.420
 despite him slagging it off.

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:50.260
 - How interesting.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.620
 - Yeah, and you will see her on "Capture Countdown."

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.300
 - When Rachel Riley's off of a tourniquet.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:56.140
 - Yeah.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:56.980
 - Yeah.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:59.500
 And yeah, Richardson argued that his art

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:04.500
 was almost parodying the mitchismo of Andalusian males

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.500
 rather than him actually being like that.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.300
 Which I don't believe.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.140
 - Yes, very.

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:11.660
 - It's a really interesting thing.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.900
 I always believe that when you're at work,

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.660
 if you're going to do it well, you mustn't have an ego.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:18.940
 And I used to say for years and years,

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:21.500
 Picasso famously didn't behave terribly well

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:22.900
 in all sorts of ways.

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:26.900
 But I'm guessing that when he went in front of the easel,

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.820
 that all went away.

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:31.620
 And years later, I found this wonderful quote saying,

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:33.100
 "When I enter my studio,

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.580
 "I leave my personality outside the door

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:39.140
 "as a Muslim leaves his slippers outside the mosque."

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:42.220
 - He did spend a lot of time at the easel though, didn't he?

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:44.460
 Like, it's hard to find the exact number of works

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:45.940
 that he did, but it was a lot.

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:46.780
 - It's insane.

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:49.460
 - 147,800, but that's not exact.

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.100
 It's...

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:54.260
 - That's according to the official website.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:55.940
 Yeah, they've done counting up and they,

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:58.660
 and we've lost a lot of it because in his early days,

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:01.620
 he used to burn his bits of art to keep his fire going.

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:03.180
 - Yeah, along with his wives.

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.060
 Yeah, they taught them all on the boom fire.

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:07.100
 - I worked out that that's one work of art

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:10.220
 for every five hours, 25 minutes of his life.

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:13.500
 If he started as a baby and carried on going

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.060
 until he met Pharrell that time.

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:16.540
 - Which once you've had your first smoke,

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:18.500
 you might as well end up with a paintbrush.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:22.420
 He also was responsible for a major art theft,

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:24.460
 which I hadn't realized because we'd mentioned before

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:27.260
 on the show that he was accused of stealing the Mona Lisa.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:28.820
 - He was interviewed by the police, right?

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:29.980
 - Yes. - He was.

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:30.820
 - Yes.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:31.820
 - Because a pollinair, his friend,

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:33.340
 shopped him to the police.

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:34.180
 - Yes.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:35.700
 - And Picasso then went to court and denied

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.340
 he'd ever met him, even though he's one of his best friends.

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:39.660
 - It's serious.

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:41.300
 - It's quite a low moment, isn't it?

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.820
 In their friendship, in their moral lives.

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:46.100
 - That's probably the best indication of the power

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.780
 that Picasso had that he thought he could jedi his way

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:49.620
 through, like...

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:51.180
 - The thing was, when he described the person

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:53.260
 who actually stole it, the police did a sketch

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.020
 and the noses on this side of his face

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:58.300
 and the eyebrows on this side.

00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.540
 - But there's more to it, isn't there?

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:01.820
 - Well, there is more to it, yes, because...

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:04.220
 So that was 1911, but actually in 1907,

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.300
 there were these two Iberian statues

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:07.820
 stolen from the Louvre.

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:09.700
 And I think there's just been a book written

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:11.060
 which puts all the pieces together,

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:14.100
 but Picasso had first spotted them in about 1904,

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.300
 fallen in love with them, told all his mates,

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:17.540
 love these statues.

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.180
 They were put in storage.

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:20.940
 Then they disappeared.

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:24.380
 Turned out they'd been stolen by this chap called Pierre.

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:27.540
 And he was mates with Picasso and the dodgy Apollinaire.

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:29.180
 - He was Apollinaire's secretary, I think.

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:30.820
 - He was Apollinaire's secretary, yes.

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:32.700
 But it turned, basically,

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:35.540
 Picasso's lover at the time, Fernanda Olivier,

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:38.860
 said that he had all lots of artworks around his house.

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:41.060
 And then he had these two statue heads

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:43.060
 under some clothes in his wardrobe.

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:44.380
 And she asked him about them once and he said,

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:47.620
 "Oh, we shouldn't display them anywhere too prominent."

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:50.660
 And it turned out to be these two stolen statues

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:52.060
 from the Louvre.

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:55.580
 - But we assume that Pierre had given them to Picasso.

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:57.740
 Maybe Picasso had asked him to steal them.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:59.940
 Some people say that Pierre couldn't have carried them

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:02.260
 both out under his coat, which is what he claimed.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:03.700
 So maybe Picasso was there.

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:05.140
 - It's a lot easier to steal stuff

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:06.820
 from the Louvre in those days, wasn't it?

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:07.980
 - I was a piece of this, yeah.

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.620
 - Yeah, the lousy security, didn't they?

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:12.020
 - Yeah, I think there was a story

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:13.660
 that Pierre once once said to his girlfriend,

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:15.020
 "I'm going to the Louvre today.

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:16.620
 Do you want me to pick anything else for you?"

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:18.980
 (laughing)

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:22.460
 And then ironically, Picasso is the most stolen artist

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:23.800
 in history now.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.380
 But I think it's largely 'cause he made so much, right?

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:28.580
 - You can't help stealing one, you pick up a sketch.

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:29.940
 - Yeah, and following the secretary

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:32.300
 had something to do with it, I'm sure.

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.700
 Shifting his stuff back to...

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:37.380
 - So even when he was in his 70s and 80s,

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:40.860
 he was quite a womanizer, Picasso.

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:43.860
 And whenever anyone came to his house who he fancied,

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:47.140
 he would make a little sculpture of a little man

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:50.140
 with an enormous phallus and then give it to them

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:52.140
 as like a love gift.

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:53.460
 - Right.

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:56.540
 - Did that work a high percentage of the time?

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:59.580
 - It didn't work so often because he quite often

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:01.740
 did it in front of his wife.

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:05.500
 And anyone who'd been given this phallic item

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:07.940
 was not allowed back in the house.

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:09.060
 'Cause his wife would just be like,

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:10.940
 "Well, you're obviously not coming back."

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:11.780
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:14.020
 - And again, this is going to John Richardson.

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:14.860
 - John Richardson.

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:18.380
 - To say, given all these sort of anecdotal things

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:22.100
 and the naughtiness that he was an extraordinary painter

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:25.220
 and those two statues he mentioned inspired him

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:27.460
 for Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:29.020
 - Yeah, which is a great painting.

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:31.580
 - Is described by John Golding, the art critic,

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:33.580
 as the greatest painting of the 20th century.

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:34.740
 It's so influential.

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:36.340
 - It's kind of cool for him to take,

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:38.380
 like looking back at it now,

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.220
 if the ends justify the means,

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:41.740
 it's fine that he stole those things

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.660
 if they inspired those great works.

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:44.820
 - Yeah, and no one gave us just about

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:46.780
 two random Iberian statues

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:48.460
 from 2000 years ago in storage.

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:50.580
 - Remind me to not have James as my lawyer.

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:54.060
 We were going to do a fact about them

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:56.540
 in the podcast the next week.

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:59.260
 - He used to make some of his paints as well.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.700
 There's a particular brown that he made,

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:04.900
 which we only now know what the secret source was.

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:05.740
 - HP.

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:10.180
 - No, not quite.

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:14.060
 - It was his three-year-old daughter's poo.

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:16.380
 - Oh, come on, Dan, no.

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:19.420
 - Poocasso, they called the article.

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:23.540
 Yeah, he used to say that the best feces as well

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:26.860
 would be from a mother who the infant was being breastfed.

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:27.940
 - Well, I would say that like,

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:30.060
 this is a three-year-old child, right?

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:33.700
 But definitely the poo of a much younger baby

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:35.820
 is a color that you can't really see anywhere else

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.140
 in the world. - Oh, true, yes.

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:39.140
 - I never see the felt tip the same color

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:41.460
 as a nappy from a two-month-old.

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:44.740
 - Well, you've seen my tie, though, it's very similar.

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:50.140
 - Listeners, John is wearing a tie,

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:52.900
 which is like 50 shades of feces.

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:59.180
 - But nice, orangey baby feces, the harmless kind.

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:01.500
 - He also, I mean, we're talking about his paintings,

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.620
 but he predicted in his own lifetime

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:06.060
 that he would be more known for his poetry than his paintings.

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:08.420
 - Poocasso. - Yeah, after his death.

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:11.020
 He wrote over 300 poems,

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:13.780
 and he also wrote two surrealist plays.

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:16.100
 - He can't really have believed,

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:18.100
 'cause he was incredibly famous for his paintings

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:19.140
 throughout his life.

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:21.020
 And no one was going, "Do you know what, Poocasso?

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:22.540
 "People should make more of your poems.

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:23.860
 "Did he really think?" - Well, he just,

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:25.340
 he probably thought they'll forget about it one day

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:26.860
 and my poems will live on after me.

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:29.300
 - I think this is a common theme with artists, though.

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.940
 You know, rock bands who always pick the wrong songs

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:34.340
 gonna be successful and hate the one that's famous.

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:36.340
 - Yeah, John Richardson, as always,

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:37.620
 they're asking him in interviews about,

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:39.140
 "Hey, I've done cuts to this countdown."

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:40.780
 And they never ask him about his Poocasso,

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:43.140
 but at first they don't.

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:45.460
 - But like that author, Karen Doyle, quote,

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.860
 "You must have touched before that if in 100 years

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:49.500
 "I'm remembered just for Sherlock Holmes,

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:51.580
 "I would have considered my life a failure."

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:55.300
 - Yeah, sorry, mate, embrace it.

00:14:55.300 --> 00:15:04.700
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James.

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:05.780
 - Okay, my fact this week

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:08.180
 is that the national song of St. Helena

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:10.820
 was written by a man who had never been there.

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:14.540
 He based his lyrics on a postcard that he had seen.

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:15.380
 - Incredible.

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:16.220
 Let's hear it.

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:19.020
 - ♪ God save our great, no ♪

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:20.820
 That is the national anthem of St. Helena

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:23.540
 because it's a British territory.

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:26.580
 - So did he base it on the stamp of the postcard?

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:30.460
 - He wrote another anthem called "My St. Helena Island"

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:32.540
 and is kind of the de facto anthem.

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:34.060
 It's not the official national anthem,

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:36.900
 but it's the one that all saints, as they're known as,

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:38.660
 in St. Helena would sing.

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:40.540
 And it was written by an American

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:42.420
 who is better known for his appearances

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:44.580
 on the eight out of 10 cats does countdown

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:46.140
 called David Mitchell.

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:50.380
 - It's stunning.

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:53.420
 - David Mitchell, he was nicknamed Old Saddle Bags

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:55.740
 and he was a DJ on a sentient island,

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:58.860
 which is, I was gonna say nearby, it's not nearby,

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:01.380
 but it's the nearest place to St. Helena,

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:03.700
 St. Helena's in the middle of the ocean.

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:06.300
 He became friends with some people from St. Helena

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:08.860
 and they suggested that he writes a song for them.

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:10.340
 And he was a bit reluctant to do that

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:11.300
 'cause he's never been there,

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:15.180
 but they sent him some postcards and he wrote this song.

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:16.020
 And that's what happened.

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:17.860
 It goes, "My heart is drifting southwards

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:19.660
 "to my home down in the sea,

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:21.060
 "to the Isle of St. Helena,

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:23.260
 "where my loved ones wait for me.

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:24.580
 "We're having a lovely time,

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:27.100
 "whether it's changeable, food is awful, wish you were here."

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:29.420
 (laughing)

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:30.260
 - That's great.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:31.100
 - Genius.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:31.940
 - It's really good.

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:33.180
 And he recorded them officially, the songs,

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:34.500
 and they made records of it.

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:36.260
 And he sent a bunch of records

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.780
 and pictures of himself to St. Helena as part of like,

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:40.420
 "Here's the merch that you can have."

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:42.380
 But he's not really known anywhere,

00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:45.500
 even in his hometown, in Memphis.

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.700
 But yeah, he's someone who's still around.

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:49.060
 I mean, it's not that long ago, right?

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:49.900
 So--

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:51.220
 - I think he's dead, isn't he?

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:52.060
 - Oh, okay, the site, I saw.

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:55.140
 - I think his family, he's recently dead, I think.

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:55.980
 - Right, okay.

00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:57.300
 - But I might be wrong about that, so I'll check.

00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:59.340
 - But nobody's blown sick arse smoke in his face yet,

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:00.460
 so you can't tell.

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:02.380
 (laughing)

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:04.500
 - It's interesting in postcards,

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:08.620
 because both Matisse and Picasso used postcards

00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:10.420
 to inspire some of their greatest work.

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:11.260
 - Did they?

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.500
 - So Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, for example,

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:16.500
 was based on a postcard that Picasso found, yeah.

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:17.340
 - Was it?

00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:18.660
 I did not know that last night.

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:20.900
 - And did you know that it's not the only

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:22.700
 national anthem or national song,

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.660
 'cause it's not strictly the national anthem

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:26.500
 that was written by somebody who'd never been there?

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:27.340
 Did you know that?

00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:30.500
 Guinea Bissau on the West Coast of Africa.

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:34.700
 The music was written by a Chinese guy called Xiao Hei,

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:38.860
 because the words were written by a separatist leader

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:41.620
 of the African party called Amal Khakabral,

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:43.620
 who was the leader of the African party

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:46.460
 for the independence of Guinea Bissau and Cape Verde.

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:47.300
 - Wow.

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.900
 - And in 1963, he went on a delegation to China

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:52.620
 and they met this guy, Xiao Hei,

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:54.180
 and asked him to write the music.

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:55.020
 - Really?

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:57.500
 - Yeah, literally last year in 2024,

00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:59.820
 Xi Jinping held a welcome ceremony

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:03.460
 for the current president of Guinea Bissau,

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:05.940
 who's a guy called Imaro Sosoko Mbalo,

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:08.460
 and they played the anthem.

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:10.340
 This is our well-beloved motherland.

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:11.860
 - It feels like it's got an edge to it

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:13.700
 when you're being hosted by Xi Jinping

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:15.420
 as the president of Tiny Guinea Bissau.

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:16.980
 And he's saying, here's your national anthem,

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:19.940
 we wrote it, by the way, don't forget it.

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:23.860
 - Well, if anyone doesn't know where Saint Helena is,

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:27.660
 basically from Guinea Bissau, head west,

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:29.500
 and it's pretty much the first place you get to,

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:31.900
 is like a tiny island in the middle of the Atlantic.

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:34.540
 - It's so isolated when you look on a map.

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:36.820
 If you go on your Google Maps or whatever on your phone,

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:38.860
 it is insanely isolated.

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:40.860
 - We cannot find a way of getting there,

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:43.060
 we'll get a lot when you try a direction.

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:44.740
 - Exactly, and there's a lot of,

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:46.220
 I watched a few tourist videos for it,

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:49.140
 where they said, you can achieve all you need to see

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:51.900
 in a single day, but why not stay for three?

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:54.060
 It's just such a...

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:55.420
 - Well, 'cause that's when the next boat leaves.

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:56.900
 - Yeah, possibly, right, yeah.

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:59.420
 - I should just say thanks to my sister-in-law's best friend,

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:01.500
 who gave me a lot of information about Saint Helena,

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:02.860
 'cause she lives there.

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:07.700
 The national dish of Saint Helena is tomato paste sandwiches.

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.980
 They're called bread and dance.

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:12.340
 And the idea is that if you're at a wedding,

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:15.020
 there'll be a big sort of table with a load of goodies on,

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:16.260
 and everyone will dance around it,

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:18.620
 and then you'll eat something from the table,

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:20.060
 and it's usually some bread and stuff.

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:23.300
 - Dipton, tomato tapenade. - Yeah, pretty much.

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:26.660
 Because it's really hard to get a hold of fresh stuff there.

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:28.780
 Basically once a month, you get a boat that comes in

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:30.140
 with fresh fruit and vegetables,

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:31.740
 and everyone legs it to the shop.

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:35.980
 Six pack of watsits, which is £2 at Poundland,

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:38.700
 in the UK, is £4 on Saint Helena,

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:41.740
 and a box of corn flakes that's £2.85 in the UK

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:43.620
 is £7 in Saint Helena.

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:45.380
 - But there's not that much else to spend your money on,

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:47.420
 so you're not complaining, are you?

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:48.660
 - No, there's not a lot going on.

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:50.580
 But two very famous residents,

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:53.140
 as most people, if they think of Saint Helena,

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:57.100
 Napoleon being exiled there after Waterloo in 1815.

00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:59.460
 And the other famous resident, you know who that is?

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:01.780
 - No. - Jonathan the Giant Tortoise.

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:04.340
 - Oh, yeah. - Who lives in the grounds

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:07.420
 of the governor's official residence, and he's 192.

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:09.340
 - Jonathan's still alive. - Yeah.

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:11.220
 - Still going pretty amazing. - Yeah.

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:13.860
 - Was five when Queen Victoria was crowned.

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:15.940
 - Probably he's died quite a few times,

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:18.460
 and they've just replaced him with another tortoise.

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:20.020
 - No, no. - Like SEO trot.

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:21.340
 - Yeah. - He's not.

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:24.380
 He's terribly well, if I've got a quote about him.

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:25.220
 - From him? - Yeah.

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:26.740
 No, it's from his vet.

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.700
 - He said, "Cowabunga, dude."

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:30.220
 - It's from his vet.

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:33.900
 Jonathan is now blind, but he still has a tremendous libido.

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:37.300
 - No, so that's your Picasso note.

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:39.900
 - Oh, yeah, no, sorry.

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:42.660
 - Kind of started off with the East India Company,

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:47.660
 who were doing lots of trade with the East and with Europe,

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:50.060
 and they needed somewhere to stop on the way,

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:51.780
 'cause there's no Suez Canal in those days,

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:53.940
 so you go all the way around Africa,

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:56.980
 and they would always call it St Helena on the way,

00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:00.620
 and eventually they decided to put a colony down there,

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:03.660
 and the first laws included God was to be worshipped

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:05.420
 and served diligently,

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:07.780
 and semen were not allowed to stay on the island

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:09.300
 without permission.

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:10.140
 - Oh, really?

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:11.300
 - If you were caught harboring a sailor,

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:13.060
 you'd be fined five pounds.

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:14.300
 - What's wrong with sailors?

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:16.060
 Should be inviting people, I would have thought.

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:17.740
 - Yeah, I think they just didn't want anyone

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:19.860
 coming on the island who wasn't supposed to be there.

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:20.700
 - Okay. - Right?

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:23.380
 - Given it was only sailors who were going by.

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:25.820
 - Yeah, yeah, who else are you gonna get, swimmers?

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:26.660
 - Yeah.

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:28.140
 - Do you know what the postcode is, on St Helena?

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:30.420
 - No, that's good, what?

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:33.020
 - Well, it's STHL1ZZ, the point being,

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:35.020
 it's a Royal Mail postcode,

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:37.580
 and it had its own postcode, I think,

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:42.140
 but apparently people kept writing to St Helena,

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:45.100
 and Mail kept going to St Helens in Merseyside,

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:49.620
 which is quite actually quite a long way to go from there.

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:50.460
 - That's brilliant.

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:51.860
 - Hard to know what to do with that mail

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:52.980
 when it drops through your doorstep,

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:54.900
 so they go from a Royal Mail postcode.

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:56.660
 - 'Cause that was the only way you could really get there

00:21:56.660 --> 00:22:00.580
 for a very long time, which was the RMS St Helena,

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:02.300
 and it was the Royal Mail ship

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:03.620
 that would bring all the post over,

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:06.300
 so you would sort of jump onto that in order to get over.

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:07.700
 - And someone tried to post themselves

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:09.220
 out of St Helena, actually, didn't they?

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:10.060
 - Did they?

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:13.180
 - Yes, so another thing that was useful by the Brits

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:15.820
 was in the Boar War, 1900 to 1902,

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:20.100
 they sent 6,000 Boar prisoners of war to this tiny place.

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:22.660
 God knows how they suddenly accommodated them,

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:26.540
 and there was one prisoner of war called Andrés Smorenberg,

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:29.320
 who made this crate, and he wrote on it,

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:33.740
 "Curios Only" inside here, and then he climbed in,

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:35.860
 and he got the crate put in a place

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:38.900
 where it was gonna be picked up by a passing mail ship,

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:41.300
 put a fake address on in London,

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:44.140
 filled it with like clothes and matches and water,

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:46.820
 and bedded down for the 20-day journey.

00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:49.740
 And sadly, even though, that's what I said,

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:53.860
 even though he marked it with care and this side up,

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:56.460
 it was tossed around quite badly,

00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:58.300
 and he was very severely concussed,

00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:00.100
 and then when they landed at Ascension Island,

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:03.500
 they got out sort of an unconscious damaged man

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:05.180
 and sent him straight back to St Helena.

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:06.540
 - Oh, so he didn't die, okay.

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:07.780
 - He didn't die, no, but--

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:10.340
 - They left him in someone's bin area for a few days.

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:11.900
 (laughing)

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:15.260
 - So St Helena and the RMS St Helena, the boat

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:16.460
 that you used to get there on,

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:18.860
 both, of course, named after the actual St Helena,

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:20.380
 which I'm sure you knew,

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:24.700
 the mother of the Emperor Constantine, and also a saint,

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:28.300
 famous for discovering parts of the true cross,

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:30.460
 which she excavated from the Holy Land

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:32.260
 when she was visiting there.

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:34.300
 She excavated three crosses, actually,

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:36.340
 but she knew she'd got the real one

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:37.740
 when it created a miracle

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:40.540
 by curing a sick woman who touched it.

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:43.740
 But not only that, she also discovered the true nails

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:47.540
 that were holding the cross and Jesus onto the cross.

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:50.060
 - The true hammer that was used to bang the nails in.

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:52.860
 - No, no, that isn't mentioned in my research,

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:56.260
 but the nails were there, and also uniquely,

00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:59.900
 the Holy Rope that Jesus was tied to the cross with,

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:03.900
 which is unique, it's the only relic of the Holy Rope.

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:06.100
 - How interesting, because I was taught at school

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:10.060
 that he was nailed and that the other thieves were tied,

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:11.140
 and he wasn't tied.

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:13.300
 - It could have been one of the thieves is--

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:14.580
 - I mean, it's all made up, isn't it?

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:17.460
 - Well, we don't know where she was born,

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:19.300
 but that's the thing, and there's an old British legend

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:22.020
 that she was a British princess.

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:23.020
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:25.660
 - The daughter of old King Cole of Colchester.

00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:27.220
 - Of old Mary the Old Soul, babe.

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:31.820
 - Yes, and Colchester has, on its coat of arms,

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:33.580
 it has the three nails that she discovered.

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:34.420
 - Really?

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:35.260
 - Yeah.

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:36.620
 - Oh, wow.

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:37.460
 - That's very good.

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:38.620
 Well, this is interesting.

00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:41.820
 So where do you think the second largest collection

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:44.300
 of St. Helinian's saints?

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:45.140
 - Saints is what they're called.

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:47.100
 - The saints are.

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:49.940
 - Well, I'm gonna say St. Helin's, I reckon.

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:52.060
 - And Merseyside, they got distracted.

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:55.460
 - It's not, it's Swindon.

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:56.300
 - Is it?

00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:57.140
 - No.

00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:00.540
 - Swindolina, as it's known to the locals in Swindon.

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:01.860
 - Oh, no.

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:04.060
 - Like St. Helina, Swindolina.

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:06.500
 - Swindolina, there's about a fifth

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:08.020
 of what the current population

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:09.940
 in actual St. Helina is in Swindon.

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:11.460
 So there's like 800 people there.

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:12.300
 - What are they doing there?

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:13.980
 - Well, they were all given British nationalship

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:16.020
 in 2002 after the Falkland Wars.

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:19.220
 And so if you want to go meet locals from St. Helina,

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:20.060
 go to Swindon.

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:20.900
 - How cool.

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:22.940
 - Didn't John Richardson move to Swindon?

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:23.780
 - He did move to Swindon.

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:25.860
 - He did move there, he moved there

00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:28.980
 because he worked out that it had the best transport links

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:30.060
 in the whole of the UK.

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:31.260
 - Yeah, to get into London

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:33.220
 and to get to the gigs he'd needed to.

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:34.900
 That's right, God, he's more prolific

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:36.620
 than we've given him credit for, really.

00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:37.980
 - Oh, we're trying to get him on this show.

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:39.260
 What's going on there?

00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:41.840
 (upbeat music)

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:46.100
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three.

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:47.620
 And that is my fact.

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:51.140
 My fact this week is that to go into

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:54.700
 the BBC's sound department in Made of Vale,

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:56.460
 you have to walk down a set of steps

00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:58.400
 that are each one third concrete,

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.220
 one third carpet and one third wood.

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:03.820
 This is amazing.

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:06.060
 I saw this fact, I should say,

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:08.960
 when I was just scrolling through Facebook earlier this year

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:12.540
 and Tony Wei, who I'm friends with, he's a movie star.

00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:14.660
 He's in The Edge of Tomorrow, the Tom Cruise movie.

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:15.620
 - All right, Plank.

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:19.340
 - Yeah, he's also in a lot of British sitcoms,

00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:22.900
 black books and anything you can think of after life

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:24.980
 with Ricky Gervais, he's a great actor.

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:28.220
 He was there and he took a photo event and showed it

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:29.060
 and it's pretty amazing.

00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:32.460
 So when I say that the staircase is a third of each.

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:33.980
 - It's like you've got a runner down the middle

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:35.620
 but either side is different.

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:36.940
 - That's a very good way of putting it.

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:39.540
 Yeah, so this is where the BBC do their foley,

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:40.980
 which is the sound effects,

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:44.620
 the extra noises that go into TV, radio and movies.

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:47.340
 And they have a whole bottom floor there,

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:49.740
 which is pretty extraordinary when you get a walk through it.

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:52.700
 So I watched a video of Sean Keveney doing it,

00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:53.540
 the radio.

00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:54.780
 - Another friend of yours, is he done?

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:57.700
 - Actually is, yeah, he actually is.

00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:00.860
 So they have a kitchen that's set up and it's all mic'd up

00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:03.140
 and so you can make tea and you can slam cupboards

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:04.020
 and you can move bottles.

00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:06.660
 So anytime they need that, that's all done there.

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:09.940
 They have a room where it's just full of seaweed and sand

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:11.740
 and little mats that you can walk on

00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:13.340
 that can create the sound of the ocean,

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:16.380
 the forest with the magnetic tapes or compressed snow

00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:18.300
 when you throw the mat on top of sand.

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:19.300
 - Seaweed. - That's great.

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:21.140
 - Yeah, I mean, now that you say that.

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:22.380
 - What noise is the seaweed making?

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:23.220
 - Yeah.

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:24.060
 - Is that just the sound of seaweed?

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:24.900
 - That's a really good point.

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:26.300
 It must be artificial.

00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:28.100
 It looked exactly like seaweed in the-

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:30.740
 - Is it seaweed inside the water?

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:32.220
 - No, no, this is just on the floor.

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:34.060
 - That the seaweed would just dry out in about two minutes.

00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:35.380
 - Well, they've probably got a seaweed person

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:37.540
 who, the interns job on your first day.

00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:39.060
 - I know it wouldn't have been seaweed.

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:41.940
 - So when I worked in radio and when I started,

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:44.980
 we used to use quarter inch tape, recording tape

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:47.260
 for lots of effects like walking through grass.

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:48.900
 - Yeah. - You'd rustle that.

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:49.740
 - Well, that's what they had though.

00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:52.380
 Yeah, all this tape that was in piles.

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:54.100
 And I messaged Tony to say,

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:55.580
 is there anything else that you saw there?

00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:58.060
 And he said there's also a foley coat.

00:27:58.060 --> 00:27:59.420
 So it's made of different fabrics.

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:01.140
 It's a coat you put on, made of different fabrics

00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:03.460
 with different kinds of zips and fastenings attached

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:06.220
 to replicate any kind of clothing sound that you want,

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:07.780
 but all in one coat.

00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:09.620
 - That looks like it would be a really cool coat.

00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:10.740
 - No, Anna.

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:13.140
 How often have you been getting off a train

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:14.580
 and you're like, I need my ticket

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:16.460
 and you've only got five pockets.

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:18.500
 You've no idea which pocket it's in.

00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:20.580
 - And you're making a mad array of noises.

00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:22.860
 (laughing)

00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:23.860
 Sorry, guys.

00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:25.620
 - So I wonder if that foley coat was used,

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:28.300
 there's a very famous story about Mrs. Dale's diary,

00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:32.260
 which was the sort of forerunner of the arches way back when.

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:33.900
 They were trying to get the sound

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:35.380
 of somebody opening a parcel.

00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:37.020
 Mrs. Dale was delivered a parcel.

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:39.380
 They tried paper and sound like it.

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:41.180
 'Cause famously in sound effects,

00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:42.860
 often you think of a helicopter,

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:45.100
 sounds like (imitates helicopter sounds)

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:47.100
 which we used to make using what's called a double ender,

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:49.780
 which is a wire with two brass plugs on the end.

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:50.620
 - Right.

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:51.460
 - It sounds like a helicopter,

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:53.260
 'cause what a helicopter actually sounds like

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:55.180
 is not like what you think a helicopter's supposed

00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:56.020
 to sound like.

00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:57.580
 - No, it's just very, very loud hum.

00:28:57.580 --> 00:28:59.140
 - It's a loud engine, yeah.

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:00.420
 - You can't really hear what you're saying, yeah.

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:03.620
 - So anyway, somebody undid their zip as an experiment

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:05.100
 and the producer said, what's that?

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:06.220
 - That's an amazing sound.

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:08.220
 That's perfect parcel opening.

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:12.340
 So when the script comes, Mrs. Dale, oh, hello there.

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:13.180
 (imitates helicopter sounds)

00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:14.620
 Oh, what have you got in there?

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:15.460
 She said.

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:17.180
 (laughing)

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:19.540
 - Okay, I'm seeing where the double ender name

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:20.380
 came from.

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:21.940
 (laughing)

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:23.580
 I really hadn't quite realized

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:25.580
 that what being a Foley artist entailed,

00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:27.040
 and I think I want it as a job.

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:30.620
 It's so cool if you're working in the films.

00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:32.540
 Basically, they'll be sent the film

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:34.620
 and they'll come into a room and they've got all their props

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:35.460
 and often they've collected,

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:37.860
 I think all Foley artists collect just like hundreds

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:39.380
 and hundreds of different props.

00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:40.900
 Bring them in, lay them all out.

00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:42.620
 And they've got a script which tells them vaguely

00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:43.460
 what sounds to make,

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:45.740
 but then they watch the film and live,

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:48.020
 they try to imitate what the person's doing.

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:49.700
 So you see them sort of jerking around,

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:51.300
 clutching at something quickly.

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:52.460
 Stomp, stomp, stomp.

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:55.060
 They have to grab a shoe, reach for a cloth.

00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:56.140
 It's amazing, isn't it?

00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:56.980
 - It is amazing.

00:29:56.980 --> 00:30:00.020
 And those items, if it makes the perfect sound,

00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:01.900
 you just want to keep it forever.

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:04.620
 And they get passed down from generation to generation.

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:09.620
 So I was reading an interview with someone called Alison D. Moore

00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:13.420
 and her former partner in Foley had retired

00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:15.900
 and he gave her a copper towel bar

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:18.220
 with a koi fish on each end.

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:19.340
 And when you twisted it,

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:22.660
 it made a screech that sounded exactly like a startled cat.

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:25.940
 And he was like, this is my pride and joy.

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:27.660
 I take it everywhere I go,

00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:29.620
 but you can have it now I've retired.

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:31.220
 - Wow. - So good.

00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:32.380
 - The BBC, I wondered, John,

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:34.260
 when you were saying that about the Foley sounds,

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:35.580
 was that live radio,

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:37.980
 the Foley was happening live along with it?

00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:41.180
 - I did very little actual live radio.

00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:45.700
 No, you just add the sound effects as you went along.

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:47.580
 Well, you were recording live, of course.

00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:49.860
 And it was a famous, not famous to you,

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:52.100
 but to me, I used to do a radio show

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:53.700
 called The News Hudlines with Roy Hardy.

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:55.180
 It was incredibly quick on the draw.

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:58.100
 A bit like a sort of Lee Mack of his day, very fast.

00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:02.460
 And there was a sketch that involved a fridge.

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:03.740
 And in the script,

00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:07.020
 the studio manager saw SFX door opens.

00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:08.740
 And that's a standard BBC sound effect

00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:10.260
 because the rattle of the door knob.

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:12.580
 - Yeah, yeah, like that.

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:13.660
 - And so, it's a,

00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:15.300
 Rory said, I'll just look in the fridge.

00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:16.140
 And there was a,

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:18.460
 he said, oh, a wooden fridge.

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:21.940
 It's a wonderful moment.

00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:23.340
 - It is amazing, but it was really,

00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:26.100
 it was a very strong thing with the BBC for live radio,

00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:27.780
 particularly comedy shows,

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:28.900
 like The Goon Show.

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:30.700
 And there was a famous incident where

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:32.260
 in the script, Nettie Seagoon,

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:33.420
 who was played by Harry Seagoon,

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:36.460
 was to be hit by a sock full of custard.

00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:38.220
 And they tried all these different sounds.

00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:39.060
 They couldn't get it.

00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:41.460
 And Spike Milligan got so frustrated during rehearsal

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:42.620
 that he took his sock off.

00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:43.780
 He grabbed an assistant,

00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:46.780
 sent them to the BBC canteen to fill it up with custard,

00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:48.460
 which they did, brought it back,

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:50.620
 walloped Harry Seagoon over the head with it.

00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:52.900
 And it still didn't get the sound that they need.

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:54.460
 But that story got out.

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:56.580
 And the BBC got lots of complaints

00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:59.660
 because this was in the last year of post-war rationing.

00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:01.780
 And they said, you are wasting good custard.

00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:03.580
 - Do they not drink it afterwards out of the cell?

00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:05.740
 - Well, regardless of what they did.

00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:06.580
 - No, that is wasteful.

00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:08.140
 - 'Cause they usually say on those programmes,

00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:10.580
 "Don't worry, the food was shared amongst the crew

00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:12.740
 "afterwards." - Yes, yeah.

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:14.700
 - Those bizarre sound effects,

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:16.700
 I remember I used to briefly please the programme

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:17.620
 called The Burgess Wave,

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:20.140
 written by David Romick and Andrew Marshall.

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:22.500
 And they used to take great pleasure

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:24.580
 in writing sound effects for impossible to do.

00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:27.260
 And I remember one was SFX,

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:30.500
 Genghis Khan slices somebody's stomach off.

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:33.700
 - Oh, wow. - It was quite a while,

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:35.420
 that took to get right. - What did you do for that?

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:36.260
 - What did you do?

00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:37.100
 - Well, I went to the canteen.

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:38.700
 I got a fresh stomach.

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:41.260
 (all laughing)

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:43.020
 It is interesting.

00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:47.020
 It's one of those unsung things in movies and television

00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:49.820
 because without those little sounds,

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:52.420
 it doesn't have heft at all.

00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:54.940
 When we did the first episode of Splitting Image,

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:56.660
 we decided not to have a laugh track

00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:58.340
 'cause I don't know why,

00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:01.260
 but no time, I think.

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:03.020
 And it seemed completely boring

00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:04.500
 'cause we used to make Splitting Image

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:06.940
 by recording the voice track first

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:08.820
 and then they puppeteer's mime to it.

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:11.620
 And of course, they're made of rubber.

00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:14.420
 So when a puppet touched the desk

00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:16.740
 and it was a pre-recorded thing, nothing happened.

00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:18.660
 So the two guys, two sound guys,

00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:21.060
 absolute geniuses stood up literally all night

00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:23.620
 doing all that, you know, touching the table,

00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:26.140
 banging each other's heads, scratching their clothes.

00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:28.220
 And suddenly it comes alive.

00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:30.660
 No, it was an amazing thing

00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:33.220
 'cause actually we owe the whole existence

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:34.660
 of Splitting Image to those two guys.

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:36.100
 - Yeah.

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:39.740
 I was talking about this Foley artist called Alison D. Moore.

00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:40.900
 I read an interview with her.

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:41.740
 It was really interesting.

00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:43.940
 She said that there are more astronauts on earth

00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:46.180
 than people working in Foley at the moment.

00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:47.020
 - What?

00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:50.660
 - So I reckon that there's about 100 people doing Foley.

00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:54.140
 And there are more people who've been in space than that.

00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:56.460
 She said that they can literally change the rating

00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:59.820
 of a film by the sounds that they put in.

00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:04.740
 So if there is, for instance, an oral sex scene,

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:07.060
 if they make it sound really filthy,

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:10.420
 then it can go up from a 15 to an 18.

00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:12.460
 - But what's the, what's the, is it just like...

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:16.220
 - That's normal oral sex, that's how that sounds.

00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:19.020
 - I think that downgrades it to like a U if you do that.

00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:23.700
 - It is important to say that the Foley is a specific thing,

00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:25.940
 which is something that's made on the spot.

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:27.380
 Isn't it not like a recording?

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:28.220
 - Yeah.

00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:29.060
 - That doesn't count as a Foley.

00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:31.660
 - You get lots of sound effects artists.

00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:34.300
 - But I just wanted to give some people a hint

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:37.500
 of things, recordings that could be useful in other contexts.

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:39.660
 So for example, the roar of a leopard

00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:41.940
 sounds like someone roughly sawing wood.

00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:42.780
 - Okay.

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:43.620
 - Which is useful.

00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:44.700
 - Okay, good to know.

00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:47.060
 - Bill Bailey said, without the beat in the background,

00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:49.420
 jazz basically sounds like an armadillo

00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:51.140
 was let loose on the keyboard.

00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:52.700
 So if you wanted that sound...

00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:56.660
 - It's amazing though, because since BBC started

00:34:56.660 --> 00:35:00.340
 recording their stuff and other massive production studios,

00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:03.300
 there's these huge Foley archives that now exist.

00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:05.820
 And a lot of them have been made available to the public.

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:08.980
 So the BBC have over 33,000 of its sound effects

00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:11.340
 that are just on a website you can download

00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:13.500
 and use as part of whatever you want to use.

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:15.260
 It's open to the public.

00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:17.700
 Hanna-Barbera also is used a lot.

00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:21.140
 So Hanna-Barbera that made the Flintstones and so on.

00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:24.020
 Their sounds have been used in so many places

00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:26.620
 you wouldn't expect multiple Mario Kart

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:28.740
 and Mario video games have the sounds

00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:30.420
 that would have been used in the Flintstones

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:32.540
 that are sort of peppered all the way through.

00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:33.380
 - Really?

00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:34.220
 - Yeah.

00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:35.540
 - And they made those sounds by getting a pterodactyl

00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:37.820
 to put their beak on a record player.

00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:40.060
 (laughing)

00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:43.900
 - Yeah, but it's, yeah, it's pretty wild.

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:46.300
 And we missed, I think it was the first 10 years

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:49.020
 of any kind of recording with BBC radio

00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:52.340
 until the arrival of a thing called the Blatner phone.

00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:54.260
 It was only one machine that was recording

00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:55.860
 all the radio output at the time

00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:57.500
 that was coming from the BBC.

00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:59.900
 And it wasn't a great recording necessarily,

00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:03.260
 but the machine, the spools that would hold the tape

00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:05.700
 were ginormous and the tape would be traveling

00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:06.660
 at really high speeds.

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:09.140
 So it would be traveling at five feet per second

00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:11.020
 to record it, which was really dangerous

00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:13.580
 for anyone who had to monitor the tape

00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:15.420
 because if it broke off,

00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:18.180
 it would be like shrapnel shooting out the tape.

00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:19.980
 And it was like a razor's edge.

00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:21.700
 You would be cut to pieces if it shot.

00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:23.140
 - Oh, like a ninja?

00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:23.980
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:24.820
 So it was incredibly dangerous.

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:25.660
 - That's a great murder mystery.

00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:26.660
 That should be a Jonathan Creek episode.

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:28.020
 - Yes, that's true, yeah.

00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:29.940
 And that would happen, it would be more dangerous

00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:32.380
 because eventually they got two of these machines,

00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:34.940
 the Blatner phone, which meant that they could change tape

00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:36.940
 on one while recording on the other.

00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:38.740
 So that was a seriously dangerous thing.

00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:40.060
 They used to have to wear heavy gloves

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:42.060
 and any time they were doing something

00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:42.900
 that looked a bit delicate,

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:44.460
 they would run to the other side of the room

00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:46.340
 in case it exploded on them.

00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:47.700
 - Hang on, presumably when you change the tape,

00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:48.820
 you stop the, you stop the tape.

00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:50.780
 - Yeah, yeah, but just, I mean, the think and overheat,

00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:53.780
 they had incidences basically, where it just got too much.

00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:55.500
 - It was the most dangerous job in the world

00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:57.060
 working for the BBC in the '50s.

00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:57.900
 - It was.

00:36:57.900 --> 00:36:58.740
 - I'm the '70s.

00:36:58.740 --> 00:36:59.980
 (laughing)

00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:02.560
 (upbeat music)

00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:07.260
 - Okay, it is time for a final fact of the show

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:09.020
 and that is Anna.

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:10.980
 - My fact this week is that every year,

00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:14.420
 tens of thousands of people attend Rwanda's

00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:17.620
 annual gorilla baby naming ceremony.

00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:21.060
 - Oh, that sounds good. - Isn't it sweet?

00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:22.060
 It is good.

00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:23.300
 - Is it sweet?

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:24.220
 - It is sweet, yes.

00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:25.460
 Yeah, yeah, nothing dark to it.

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:29.420
 Quita izina, which means to give a name in Nkinyawanda,

00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:31.580
 which is the language.

00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:33.500
 And this is so cool.

00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:36.300
 It's this whole full week of activities devoted to gorillas

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:39.060
 and it's all about their conservation and their protection

00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:40.940
 'cause there's a huge deal in Rwanda.

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:42.900
 And the highlight is this naming ceremony

00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:46.060
 where they've got a huge, really cool looking stage,

00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:49.460
 which is a wicker sculpture of a gorilla

00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:52.100
 or a bamboo sculpture of a gorilla the size of a house.

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:55.860
 And then a celebrity and all researchers.

00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:56.980
 - Who's the celebrity?

00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:58.340
 - Lots of different celebrities.

00:37:58.340 --> 00:37:59.460
 We'll get to the list.

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:01.140
 - Probably some of your mates.

00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:02.740
 (laughing)

00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:05.620
 - John Richardson's gotta have a look in naming a gorilla.

00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:07.180
 - John Keveny goes there often, doesn't he?

00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:08.020
 - Yeah.

00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:11.940
 - There are multiple characters who will come up on stage

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:14.180
 and then they'll name one of the new baby gorillas

00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:15.020
 that's been born that year.

00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:16.820
 And a big picture comes up behind

00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:19.180
 and they say, I name this gorilla

00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:20.180
 and they give them sensible.

00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:22.020
 They don't call them sort of barry.

00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:26.300
 - Well, quite a lot of the Arsenal footballers go there

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:28.500
 'cause Arsenal are sponsored by Rwanda.

00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:29.580
 - So they are, yeah.

00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:31.660
 So 'cause the president's a big Arsenal fan.

00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:32.500
 - He is, yeah.

00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:34.900
 So in 2018, Alex Scott went.

00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:37.500
 In 2019, David Louise went.

00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:42.500
 In 2020, Hector Bellerin and Patrick Obamiang went.

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:47.820
 Obamiang named a 14-year-old gorilla Ligitego, meaning goal,

00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:53.560
 and Bellerin chose Mjugarriro, meaning defender.

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:55.700
 So it's like appropriate stuff for them.

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:58.700
 So maybe next year they'll be runner-up

00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:01.860
 or smashed by Paris Saint-Germain.

00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:02.700
 - Boom.

00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:07.140
 - So do these poor gorillas have to wait

00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:10.100
 sometimes nearly a year before they get a name?

00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:11.020
 - Yes, I suppose they do.

00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:12.420
 They probably have a holding name.

00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:15.140
 - They might have their own name in their own language

00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:17.220
 and they might not care what we call them.

00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:18.420
 - No, I doubt it.

00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:19.980
 - That's it, well, no, they couldn't.

00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:21.140
 I don't know about gorillas,

00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:23.340
 but did you know that Marma sets

00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:26.740
 are the only non-human primate that call each other by name?

00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:27.580
 - Do they?

00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:28.420
 - Yeah.

00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:29.340
 And they say, "Hello, Barry."

00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:31.420
 - And there's always Barry.

00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:32.260
 - Always Barry.

00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:33.100
 They all call Barry.

00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:34.140
 - It's got a point in us, really.

00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:35.780
 - Of course it may not be their name at all.

00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:37.860
 It may be just a, all right, Sam.

00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:38.860
 - It's just a burp.

00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:43.260
 Idris Elba called, they get big names.

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:45.660
 Called Juan Narame, meaning long life.

00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:48.340
 David Attenborough's obviously named one.

00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:49.900
 But yeah, it sounds really fun.

00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:51.580
 And the idea is to protect gorillas.

00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:53.620
 And the story of protecting gorillas in Rwanda

00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:56.500
 is an amazing success story, isn't it?

00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:57.340
 So they-

00:39:57.340 --> 00:39:58.700
 - Diane Fossey.

00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:02.660
 - Diane Fossey, yes, who I'm sure we'll talk about.

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:04.500
 It's estimated that one mountain gorilla,

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:05.740
 and it's mountain gorillas there.

00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:08.540
 So there are four species and subspecies of gorilla.

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:11.460
 But one mountain gorilla can generate $3 million

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:12.900
 during its lifetime from tourism.

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:15.180
 And that all goes back into conservation.

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:16.500
 To protection.

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:19.620
 To the extent, and I found this really interesting.

00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:20.540
 So there are, like I say,

00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:23.340
 four species and subspecies of gorilla.

00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:24.540
 There's western lowland,

00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:29.060
 of which there are between 150 and 300,000.

00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:29.900
 Remember that.

00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:31.140
 There's cross river gorillas,

00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:32.660
 of which there are about 300.

00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:33.500
 Mountain gorilla,

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:35.460
 I think there are about 800 to 1,000.

00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:38.420
 And grower's gorilla, 6,500.

00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:40.340
 All are critically endangered,

00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:43.020
 except one, which is just endangered.

00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:43.980
 - Right.

00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:45.900
 - Now, have you memorized all the figures?

00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:47.860
 - Yeah, the lowland western gorillas, you said.

00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:48.700
 - There you go.

00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:50.740
 The western lowland, 150 to 300,000.

00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:52.100
 Surely they're just endangered.

00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:54.300
 No, they're critically endangered.

00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:56.420
 And the mountain gorilla from Rwanda

00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:58.780
 is the only one that's only endangered,

00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:00.700
 even though there are only 800,

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:01.940
 because their numbers are going up.

00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:02.780
 - Because they're going up.

00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:04.300
 But that's, I think that's how they do it, right?

00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:05.620
 - No, of course it's how they do it.

00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:07.740
 But I think it's an extraordinary discrepancy

00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:11.780
 between 300,800, but only one is critically endangered.

00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:13.780
 - And it's kind of surprising that they're going up,

00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:16.000
 well, certainly over the last 30 years or so,

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.660
 'cause they had a big old war in Rwanda.

00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:19.500
 - Yeah.

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:21.500
 - And in actual facts,

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:24.620
 there were 16 gorillas killed during that civil war.

00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:26.220
 But the population still--

00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:27.060
 - This is a problem now.

00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:29.100
 Gorillas or guerrillas?

00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:32.540
 - Yeah, guerrillas or guerrillas.

00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:34.220
 - I should check that actually,

00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:36.380
 that I'm not talking about guerrillas.

00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:38.740
 - What do you call a gorilla with a machine gun?

00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:39.580
 - I don't know, John.

00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:40.420
 - Sir.

00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:42.700
 (laughing)

00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:45.060
 - But yeah, basically the gorillas moved up

00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:46.980
 into the mountains away from all the humans

00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:48.060
 and all the violence.

00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:50.740
 And so that's why their numbers went way higher.

00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:52.700
 And also, none of the factions

00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:54.700
 wanted the bad publicity of killing gorillas.

00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:55.540
 - Yeah.

00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:56.380
 - So yeah, they--

00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:58.700
 - And that is amazing, but mostly the reason,

00:41:58.700 --> 00:41:59.820
 'cause it is such a success story,

00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:01.980
 is because Rwanda's run an extraordinary

00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:04.260
 protection program since then,

00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:06.140
 which basically means that they--

00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:07.620
 - How have they stopped the poaching?

00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:09.100
 Is there sort of security force?

00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:10.420
 - There's just been an amazing investment

00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:11.260
 in local communities.

00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:12.460
 So a lot of the poachers,

00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:14.820
 'cause people, I always think poachers get a bad rep,

00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:16.620
 largely they're poaching for survival, right?

00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:17.660
 That these were people in a country

00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:20.100
 that were so poor, people were struggling,

00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:22.060
 and the poachers are now involved in conservation.

00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:23.100
 So there are a lot of poachers

00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:25.860
 who do various tourist things now.

00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:28.300
 And it's just giving them real national pride

00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:30.140
 in this thing, like this big ceremony,

00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:31.540
 which means it literally doesn't happen.

00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:32.980
 - Yeah, because they worked out, as you say,

00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:35.660
 one gorilla can bring 3 million in an entire lifetime.

00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:38.060
 So it's more profitable now to be a tourist guide

00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:40.780
 rather than to kill one and get a one-off payment.

00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:44.340
 Which, and so that, I mean, it has largely come down

00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:46.500
 from the stuff I've read to Diane Fosse.

00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:48.060
 I mean, I know she's the ambassador name,

00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:51.500
 but she really kind of, she moved there back in the '70s,

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:53.540
 plopped herself on the side of the mountain,

00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:55.380
 when there was virtually no one doing that.

00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:56.940
 She was given a name,

00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:59.060
 which was the woman who lives alone in the forest

00:42:59.060 --> 00:42:59.900
 by all the locals.

00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:01.220
 - Big ceremony, was it?

00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:03.460
 (all laughing)

00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:05.060
 - Natalie Potman Cableog.

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:07.740
 - She had to wait a year before they thought of it.

00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:11.100
 - But yeah, so Diane Fosse, the reason she went out there

00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:14.740
 was this was off the back of a man called Lewis Leakey,

00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:16.060
 who we've mentioned before,

00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:17.540
 one of my favorite people in the world

00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:20.420
 of paleoanthropology, had wild theories

00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:22.260
 and also had a lot of discoveries

00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:26.540
 about ancient versions of Homo sapiens and so on.

00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:29.140
 - Dan, a few episodes ago, we had to fade you out

00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:31.100
 when you started going into this kind of thing.

00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:31.940
 (all laughing)

00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:32.980
 - Well, he thinks that the reason

00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:34.820
 that we became the dominant species of planet Earth

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:36.660
 is because we were too smelly to eat,

00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:39.700
 as we were in the wild, he's a brilliant guy.

00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:42.300
 But he thought that the people who should go out

00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:44.340
 and study apes should be a single woman

00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:46.260
 with no scientific training.

00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:50.340
 He's very much the Picasso of the paleoanthropology world

00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:52.540
 in that he was a bit dubious with women.

00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:54.340
 He had a lot of researchers around him

00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:58.100
 who were, let's say, at his whim.

00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:01.580
 He was a bit of deviant, but he did amazing things.

00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:03.220
 - Did you say he was your favorite?

00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:04.060
 - Do you know what?

00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:04.900
 We can edit that, right?

00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:07.540
 (all laughing)

00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:08.980
 But he picked Diane Fosse.

00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:10.180
 He thought she'd be perfect.

00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:11.020
 And he said to her,

00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:12.620
 "The only thing that you need to have to go out there

00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:13.860
 is no appendix."

00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:16.340
 And so she took her appendix out to go.

00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:17.580
 - Someone else must have taken it out.

00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:18.700
 - Yeah, a doctor took it out.

00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:20.620
 And then she got a letter six weeks later from him saying,

00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:22.700
 by the way, I was joking about the whole appendix thing.

00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:24.180
 - No. - Yeah.

00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:25.020
 It was too late.

00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:27.140
 She already did it by then.

00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:28.420
 - That's a problem with deadpan humor.

00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:30.060
 If you don't put the emoji afterwards,

00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:32.060
 we wouldn't get it.

00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:34.260
 - She was quite controversial though, Diane Fosse, right?

00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:35.420
 - Absolutely.

00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:37.620
 - I read that once she captured,

00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:41.820
 or her associates captured a poacher,

00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:43.140
 stripped him of his clothes,

00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:44.780
 laid him spread eagle on the ground

00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:46.820
 and lashed his genitals with nettles.

00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:48.340
 - Yeah, that's how I saw it.

00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:49.700
 - And she thought basically the way

00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:52.620
 that you deal with poachers is not like Anna says,

00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:54.820
 improving society and giving them other ways

00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:55.900
 of making money.

00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:57.780
 You should just beat it out of them.

00:44:57.780 --> 00:44:58.620
 - Yeah.

00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:00.940
 - I mean, that to be fair is kind of the twist

00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:03.420
 in her story is that she arrived as a conservationist.

00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:04.780
 She learned so much about gorillas,

00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:07.140
 wrote that incredible book.

00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:07.980
 What's it called?

00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:09.820
 - Gorillas in the Mist is a movie based on her, right?

00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:11.500
 - Yeah, based, but that's off her book.

00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:12.380
 So she wrote a book,

00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:14.340
 which was a memoir of her time there.

00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:17.260
 And then when poachers killed a gorilla

00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:19.660
 that she'd really become close with,

00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:21.220
 they'd lobbed the gorillas head off.

00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:22.700
 - Digit, it was called digit.

00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:23.540
 - That's right.

00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:25.340
 There was a turning point where she goes

00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:28.600
 from conservationist really to poacher killer.

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:30.140
 And she was furious.

00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:32.900
 And anyone who was in her way was part of the problem.

00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:34.220
 So even the anti-poaching league,

00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:36.220
 she thought, no, you're part of it as well.

00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:37.060
 And to be fair,

00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:38.780
 she had a horrific time in her early days there.

00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:40.740
 She was kidnapped by rebels.

00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:42.940
 She was sexually assaulted.

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:45.620
 She had a lot of bad times there.

00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:47.820
 - Yeah, she was tough as nails, woman.

00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:49.980
 I mean, bad childhood tough times there.

00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:51.460
 Extraordinary person.

00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:54.020
 But then she did go a little bit,

00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:54.980
 well, she just went hard line,

00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:56.100
 didn't she, towards the end? - She did.

00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:57.180
 - And sort of beat up poachers,

00:45:57.180 --> 00:45:58.100
 which is quite hardcore.

00:45:58.100 --> 00:45:59.540
 And I had actually had no idea

00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:01.620
 that she was murdered, Diane Fossey.

00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:03.460
 - Yes. - And to research this, but...

00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:05.020
 - It's just such a wild story.

00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:07.660
 So Digit was decapitated by the poachers

00:46:07.660 --> 00:46:10.500
 and his hands cut off to make ashtrays out of.

00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:11.500
 - And she was horribly mad.

00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:12.660
 She was found dead in her cabin

00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:16.620
 and bizarrely blamed on a jealous fellow researcher

00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:19.020
 in absentia, who I don't think was ever really solved.

00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:21.700
 I think we assume it was angry poachers.

00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:22.540
 - Yeah, we still don't know.

00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:24.300
 There's so many theories out there.

00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:25.660
 And she's still there though.

00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:27.700
 She's buried in the gorilla cemetery.

00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:28.740
 - Next to Digit.

00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:30.940
 She's buried next to Digit, yes.

00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:33.620
 - Gorillas though, amazing animals.

00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:35.460
 - They get high by spinning in circles.

00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:37.420
 That's a new discovery recently.

00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:41.180
 And that was like, I really loved this bit of science.

00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:43.980
 Basically, there was a viral clip that went around

00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:46.420
 of a gorilla spinning round.

00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:47.860
 And they thought, oh, that looks fun.

00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:49.540
 Let's see if anyone else does that.

00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:51.260
 And then they did more research and found out

00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:53.180
 that yeah, they do do that.

00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:54.980
 - Well, if you will withhold drugs from the kids,

00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:56.380
 they'll find a way, won't they?

00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:58.940
 They make a, you know how we make a big deal

00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:00.180
 about lions and tigers roaring?

00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:03.100
 I think the gorilla roar is the most frightening.

00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:05.900
 So they do that and then they make the belch sound,

00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:08.060
 which is the other main kind of vocalization.

00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:11.300
 And that's a little, sort of like a little burp or a growl,

00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:13.340
 which says, I'm here, don't worry, I'm your friend.

00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:15.460
 And so if researchers are working with gorillas,

00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:17.460
 then they learn to make that sound straight away

00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:19.460
 to reassure them because you're in the jungle,

00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:20.940
 you don't have that good visibility.

00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:23.660
 So it's not as much about facial recognition.

00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:26.700
 Although the other thing that researchers have to do

00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:28.100
 is learn to memorize.

00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:30.420
 And this is something that I think was pioneered

00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:31.780
 a little bit by Diane Fossey,

00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:33.700
 but learn to memorize their nose prints.

00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:35.020
 So that after a few months,

00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:37.660
 you can spot one 50 yards away and immediately know.

00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:38.500
 - Well, that makes sense.

00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:39.340
 - Barry.

00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:40.180
 - Yeah, that's great.

00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:42.340
 - Is it that obvious what the prints are?

00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:44.340
 Or do you have to get really close?

00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:45.380
 'Cause like fingerprints,

00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:47.460
 you need to put your fingers in ink, right?

00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:49.100
 - It's definitely more obvious than that.

00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:52.900
 It's like wrinkles on a face, on quite a wrinkly face.

00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:54.060
 - Okay.

00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:56.060
 I noticed you were looking at me when you said that.

00:47:56.060 --> 00:47:57.860
 - I was looking past you.

00:47:57.860 --> 00:48:02.460
 - Do you know that when you arrive into Rwanda,

00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:06.300
 they go through like any airport security,

00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:08.380
 there's certain countries you can't bring fruit in and so on.

00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:10.860
 Do you know what you're not allowed to bring in to Rwanda?

00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:12.140
 - Drugs.

00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:13.020
 - Not drugs.

00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:14.860
 - Oh, you are allowed to bring drugs.

00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:16.260
 - No, it's just not the answer I'm looking for.

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:17.100
 - Okay.

00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:19.460
 - What's the answer you're looking for?

00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:21.140
 - Plastic bags.

00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:23.500
 - If you go to the official tourism website,

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:25.260
 that's on there saying you will be stopped

00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:26.620
 and you can get in serious trouble

00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:29.140
 if you're trying to smuggle plastic bags into the country.

00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:31.540
 - 12 months in prison for using plastic bags.

00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:32.980
 - Wow.

00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:33.980
 - Is it your joking?

00:48:33.980 --> 00:48:37.740
 - 100% and the fine of up to $540.

00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:41.700
 Now that law is really in place for large companies

00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:42.620
 who are breaking the law.

00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:44.860
 Like if you or I brought a plastic bag in,

00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:46.900
 we probably wouldn't get 12 months in prison,

00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:48.620
 but it is actually on the law books.

00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:50.300
 That is the punishment.

00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:51.380
 - Yeah, I remember that happening.

00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:52.860
 We all thought mad.

00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:55.180
 Imagine living without plastic bags.

00:48:55.180 --> 00:48:57.340
 And now we all sort of do.

00:48:57.340 --> 00:48:58.420
 - We don't, do we?

00:48:58.420 --> 00:49:00.540
 (all laughing)

00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:02.940
 - We just pay our 5P and suck it up.

00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:07.780
 - I think even though we've had all this talk of guerrillas,

00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:10.380
 the favorite animal in Rwanda is the cow.

00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:13.820
 They're obsessively into cows.

00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:14.860
 It's great.

00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:18.100
 And so there's lots of dances inspired by cows.

00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:19.740
 So you've got the kind of Rwandan ballet,

00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:21.020
 which is inspired by cows

00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:24.100
 where women emulate cows movements.

00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:27.100
 Maybe they're more graceful in Rwanda.

00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:28.580
 - Like what does a cow do?

00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:30.340
 It just stands there for ages

00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:32.180
 and occasionally eats a bit of grass.

00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:35.340
 - What I, gentle is what I read and I actually didn't watch it.

00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:37.180
 So gentle movements.

00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:39.020
 It's a bit of swaying sometimes.

00:49:39.020 --> 00:49:40.620
 - Swishing away a fly.

00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:41.460
 - Yeah.

00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:42.740
 - It's a tail, it's all in the tail.

00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:43.580
 - It's very unique.

00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:44.660
 - All Rwanda women have tails.

00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:45.500
 Did I not mention that?

00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:46.340
 - Oh, is that right?

00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:47.180
 - Yeah.

00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:48.460
 If you want to wish someone well,

00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:51.980
 you say may you have a cow or have thousands of cows.

00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:54.620
 - Same in America, don't have a cow man.

00:49:54.620 --> 00:49:55.460
 - Yeah.

00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:56.300
 - Okay, yeah.

00:49:56.300 --> 00:49:58.940
 - It's like Helena, cowabunga, as the turtle says.

00:49:58.940 --> 00:49:59.780
 - Yep.

00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:00.620
 Okay.

00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:02.300
 There's a lot of crossover.

00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:03.780
 But they also love milk.

00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:07.100
 And instead of going to a bar in Kigali,

00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:07.940
 capital of Rwanda,

00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:10.140
 you will go to a milk bar very often.

00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:13.420
 And I think this is since the nineties,

00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:15.020
 when after the genocide,

00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:17.580
 there was massive urbanization

00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:20.020
 and crops were decimated.

00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:21.820
 A lot of cattle were massacred

00:50:21.820 --> 00:50:23.260
 and everything changed.

00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:25.940
 And a lot of people missed that agricultural connection.

00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:27.260
 And now they all go to milk bars.

00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:28.900
 - Are they alcoholic milks?

00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:29.740
 - No.

00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:30.580
 - You can get that.

00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:31.420
 - They are not.

00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:32.260
 - Are they really?

00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:33.100
 - So they claim.

00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:34.340
 It might be that they're all getting pissed,

00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:35.820
 but they're all claiming they're just like

00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:37.300
 a hot or a cold milk.

00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:39.580
 - There's also a thing called the Garinka program,

00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:41.820
 which is the idea that the government

00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:44.420
 will give every poor family a cow.

00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:45.540
 And over the years,

00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:48.940
 they've given over 400,000 cows to different families.

00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:51.740
 And the idea is that you can use them in your

00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:53.020
 to fertilize the land.

00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:55.380
 You can help drink the milk.

00:50:55.380 --> 00:50:56.820
 If you're not living in the city.

00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:57.660
 - I was thinking,

00:50:57.660 --> 00:50:59.340
 you're sitting there in your flat in the city,

00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:00.860
 third floor of your cow in your land,

00:51:00.860 --> 00:51:02.920
 and you go, "What the fuck are we gonna do with this?"

00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:05.380
 (laughing)

00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:07.580
 - Do you think that the naming ceremony

00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:09.340
 is based on a sort of human?

00:51:09.340 --> 00:51:11.180
 Because there are lots of those around the world, right?

00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:12.020
 - Yeah, it is.

00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:14.180
 It's big and Rwanda, giving the name,

00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:16.540
 the name that you give someone determines their life.

00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:19.260
 - They are born, they have their first cigar,

00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:21.620
 and then you have a big ceremony where you name them,

00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:23.580
 and all of the family members come along,

00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:25.340
 and some people suggest different names,

00:51:25.340 --> 00:51:27.180
 and then they decide which one they're gonna go with,

00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:28.700
 and there's a big old party.

00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:29.940
 - And it's usually Idris Elba,

00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:32.060
 who it comes down to the decision in the end.

00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:33.980
 He's a very busy man, but...

00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:36.220
 - But the ancient Romans had one called

00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:38.540
 DA's illustrious of purification day.

00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:41.580
 That was what the naming ceremony was called.

00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:43.300
 According to Plutarch,

00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:45.140
 until the baby had a name,

00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:46.900
 and the umbilical cord fell off,

00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:49.500
 they were regarded as a plant rather than an animal.

00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:50.340
 - Really?

00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:52.980
 - Yes, it was only when the umbilical cord fell off.

00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:54.260
 - I thought it was like a stalk?

00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:55.780
 - Yeah, I guess you're rooted to something.

00:51:55.780 --> 00:51:57.100
 - So this is the thing, I didn't know,

00:51:57.100 --> 00:52:00.660
 I knew that from somewhere that ancient Roman women

00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:02.180
 had very small choice of names,

00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:04.340
 but if you were called Claudius, for example,

00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:06.140
 you had a daughter, she'd be called Claudia.

00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:08.060
 You wouldn't have her own name.

00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:09.940
 And if you had a second daughter,

00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:11.700
 she would be called Claudia Minor,

00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:13.740
 and the first one would be called Claudia Major.

00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:15.300
 If you had a third daughter,

00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:17.300
 she would just be called Claudius Tertia,

00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:18.860
 you know, Claudius III until...

00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:22.180
 - I think Julius Caesar had like four sisters all called Julia.

00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:23.220
 - Yes, really? - Really?

00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:24.060
 - Yeah.

00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:24.900
 - Wow.

00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:27.020
 In Hungary, there's a Hungarian naming day.

00:52:27.020 --> 00:52:28.100
 Have you heard of this?

00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:31.060
 So the idea is that a name is associated

00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:32.180
 with one day of the year,

00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:34.380
 and a lot of people will celebrate their name day

00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:35.220
 rather than actual birthday.

00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:36.300
 - Oh yeah, I think that happens in a few years.

00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:37.820
 - I think we've discussed that quite recently,

00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:39.500
 haven't we? - Often the same day.

00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:40.340
 - Oh, right.

00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:42.740
 - It's all like Ghana, where they name kids

00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:44.060
 after the day of the week.

00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:44.900
 - Yeah, right.

00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:47.380
 - So in Akan, for example, Kofi,

00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:50.420
 as in Kofi Annan means born on Friday.

00:52:50.420 --> 00:52:53.660
 And Quasi, as in Quasi Quateng means born on Sunday.

00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:54.500
 - Really?

00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:57.180
 - And Liz, as in Liz Truss, means born yesterday.

00:52:57.180 --> 00:53:00.580
 - A bit of three-year-old satire there.

00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:03.160
 (upbeat music)

00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:07.660
 - Okay, that's it.

00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:08.580
 That is all of our facts.

00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:10.500
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:13.820
 You can find us all on our various social media accounts.

00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:16.340
 I'm on Instagram @Tribaland.

00:53:16.340 --> 00:53:17.180
 James.

00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:18.020
 - My Instagram is noses.

00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:19.060
 I think it's James Harkin.

00:53:19.060 --> 00:53:20.180
 - John, you're on Instagram.

00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:22.180

00:53:22.180 --> 00:53:23.020
 - Nice.

00:53:23.020 --> 00:53:24.500
 And anything you want to plug while we're here?

00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:26.940
 - Well, I really want to say my son, Harry,

00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:30.500
 who you all know is an amazing band called Waiting for Smith.

00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:33.260
 And they've got a great new single coming out called

00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:34.460
 I Got That Smiling For You,

00:53:34.460 --> 00:53:36.620
 which I think is going to be his smash thing.

00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:39.660
 Waiting for Smith on Instagram or all the other platforms.

00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:40.500
 - Nice.

00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:42.660

 There's bits of merch.

00:53:58.380 --> 00:54:00.540
 There's the gateway to Club Fish,

00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:02.980
 the membership club where we have bonus material

00:54:02.980 --> 00:54:04.860
 popping up every fortnight.

00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:05.820
 It's a really fun place.

00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:06.660
 Check it out.

00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:07.900
 Otherwise, just come back here next week

00:54:07.900 --> 00:54:09.660
 'cause we will be back with another episode

00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:10.740
 and we will see you then.

00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:11.780
 Good bye.

00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:14.360
 (upbeat music)

00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:17.860
 - Can you do some folio?

00:54:17.860 --> 00:54:19.220
 I'm just gonna walk over there.

00:54:19.220 --> 00:54:20.060
 - Yeah.

00:54:20.060 --> 00:54:24.020
 - That's offensive.

00:54:24.020 --> 00:54:24.860
 He's not that heavy.

00:54:24.860 --> 00:54:29.740
 - And I'm back.

00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:31.020
 I just went to the...

00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:33.660
 (laughing)

00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:35.900
 I just went to the bookcase

00:54:35.900 --> 00:54:37.380
 because staring me in the face

00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:39.300
 is this book, "The Adoles of London".

00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:42.220
 - And it's by John Richardson.

00:54:42.220 --> 00:54:43.060
 Wow.

00:54:43.060 --> 00:54:43.900
 - Oh my God.

00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:45.220
 - It's by another John Richardson.

00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:46.060
 - It's so good, isn't it?

00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:46.900
 - What a coincidence.

00:54:46.900 --> 00:54:47.740
 - This guy's amazing.

00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:48.580
 - He's a polymath.

00:54:48.580 --> 00:54:50.020
 - How does he get time to do the...

00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:52.600
 (upbeat music)

00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:55.180
 (upbeat music)

00:54:55.180 --> 00:54:57.760
 (upbeat music)

00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:00.340
 (upbeat music)

00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:10.340
