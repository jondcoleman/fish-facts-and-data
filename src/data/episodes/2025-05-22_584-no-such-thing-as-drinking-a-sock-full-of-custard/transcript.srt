1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,880
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:04,480
 Hi everyone, welcome to another episode of No Such Things

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,640
 of Fish.

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,800
 Andrew Hunter Murray is away on holiday

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,580
 looking for rare species of moss

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,560
 or perhaps covering his entire house in solar panels.

7
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,360
 I'm not sure what he's doing, but he's not here.

8
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:22,360
 And so in his place, we have the founder of QI, John Lloyd.

9
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,400
 Now you'll all know John because he's been on this show

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,880
 many, many times, but if you're a new listener,

11
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,320
 then he is, he's like a master of British comedy

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,400
 over the last 40, 50 years.

13
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,800
 He was instrumental in things like not the nine o'clock news,

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,600
 black-hatter, QI of course, spitting image.

15
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,240
 If you were a fan of that back in the day,

16
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,860
 there's a really nice anecdote later on in this episode

17
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,240
 where he talks about that.

18
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,520
 Basically, he's an all-round genius

19
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,200
 and I'm sure you'll enjoy his talents on this week's show.

20
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,920
 I should quickly say, because I know he would want me to,

21
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,080
 that his son, Harry, who is a good friend of all of us,

22
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,960
 he is in a band and they have a new single out.

23
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,880
 The band is called Waiting for Smith.

24
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,600
 So if you're interested in that,

25
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,080
 then go to anywhere where you get your music

26
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,800
 or any bit of social media search for Waiting for Smith

27
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,800
 and you will find all about that.

28
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,160
 Anyway, without further ado,

29
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,920
 let us continue with another episode

30
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,080
 of No Such Things as a Fish with Mr. John Lloyd

31
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,420
 on with a podcast.

32
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,540
 (upbeat music)

33
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:38,820
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

34
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,420
 of No Such Things as a Fish,

35
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,100
 a weekly podcast coming to you

36
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,540
 from the QI offices in Hoburn.

37
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,660
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

38
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,940
 I am sitting here with James Harkin, Anna Tyshinski

39
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,180
 and John Lloyd.

40
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,500
 And once again, we have gathered round the microphones

41
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,140
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

42
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,380
 and in no particular order, here we go.

43
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,620
 Starting with fact number one, that is Lloydy.

44
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:06,620
 - So my fact is that Picasso inhaled his first cigar

45
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:09,260
 on the day he was born.

46
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,540
 (laughing)

47
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:16,540
 So Picasso was born at home on the 25th of October, 1881.

48
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,540
 He had a very difficult birth

49
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,100
 and he was unusually small and undeveloped.

50
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,660
 The midwife wrote him off as stillborn.

51
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,660
 - Oh no. - Right.

52
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,740
 - And literally parked him on a side table

53
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,420
 while she looked after his mum.

54
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,740
 - Right.

55
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,420
 - And it was fortunate because Picasso's uncle,

56
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:36,100
 his father's brother, Salvador Ruiz Blasco,

57
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,300
 who was also a doctor, happened to be there.

58
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,060
 And he was smoking a cigar as you do in those doors.

59
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,620
 - Of course, yep.

60
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,700
 - And he strode over and puffed a great waft of smoke

61
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,780
 into Picasso's face and the baby went,

62
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:48,620
 (screaming)

63
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,340
 - Oh really? - In a horrible face.

64
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,180
 - Okay.

65
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,140
 - And then he lasered a huge yell and saved his life.

66
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:53,980
 - Wow. - Okay.

67
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,540
 - So he didn't enjoy his first smoke.

68
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,100
 Like many of us, it sounds like

69
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,620
 he didn't embrace it first time round.

70
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,300
 - Well, he came round quickly

71
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,380
 'cause he was a lifelong smoker.

72
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,340
 In fact, he smoked until seven years before his death,

73
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,140
 age 91, but tellingly, he never inhaled.

74
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:10,980
 - Is that right?

75
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:11,820
 - So there you are.

76
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,660
 - The Bill Clinton.

77
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,500
 - Yeah.

78
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,660
 (laughing)

79
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,580
 - Yeah, he died in 1973.

80
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,420
 - Yeah.

81
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,580
 - Which I worked out meant that he could, in theory,

82
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:26,260
 have met Pharrell Williams, the pop star.

83
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,100
 - Okay.

84
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,140
 - And do you think they would have got along?

85
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,380
 - Well, Pharrell was only three days old

86
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,500
 when Picasso died and for all that time,

87
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,020
 Pharrell was in Virginia and Picasso was in France.

88
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:35,860
 So at least one of them

89
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,700
 would have had to make quite a lengthy trip.

90
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,740
 - Yes.

91
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,980
 - Or a Zoom call.

92
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,700
 - A Zoom call, yeah.

93
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,220
 - What are you thinking we're missing out on

94
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,220
 by them not meeting?

95
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,580
 Why them two specifically?

96
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,700
 - Well, I just think Pharrell

97
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,140
 is a very, very modern day name, right?

98
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:50,980
 - Yes, right.

99
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,740
 - And Picasso, for anyone who was born

100
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,260
 after he died, like myself,

101
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,500
 he feels like someone in the past.

102
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,340
 Do you know what I mean?

103
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,180
 So I think it's quite surprising

104
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,940
 that those two could, in theory, have met.

105
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,340
 - And, of course, Virginia, the home of tobacco,

106
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,940
 Virginia ready-rubbed and so on.

107
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:04,780
 - What a good point.

108
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,780
 - It would have got on really well.

109
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,620
 - Yes.

110
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,380
 (laughing)

111
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,900
 He was baptized Pablo Diego, Jose Francisco de Palo,

112
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:17,900
 Juan Nepum Maceno, Crispiniano Maria de los Remedios,

113
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:22,380
 de la Santissima Trinidad Rui Picasso.

114
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,020
 - Actually not, because the priest made--

115
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,780
 - Well, you could have said that before I started.

116
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,060
 (laughing)

117
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,820
 - The priest made a spelling mistake.

118
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,660
 - Oh, did he?

119
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,300
 - He was supposed to be called Crispiniano,

120
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,420
 because St. Crispin's Day, the 25th of October,

121
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,740
 was the day he was born.

122
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,340
 And the priest made a spelling mistake

123
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,820
 and called him Chipriano.

124
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,860
 - Chipriano, which is a brand of crisps.

125
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,100
 (laughing)

126
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,540
 - His first word, there's a legend behind that,

127
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,900
 that his mother says, which is that it was pencil.

128
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,460
 So he seems like a child of destiny, in a way.

129
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,780
 Yeah, I'm not allowed to do the accent

130
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,740
 on the show anymore, John,

131
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,860
 so I might as well pronounce the English versions.

132
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,420
 - Is that like for penis in Spanish as well?

133
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,260
 I think it might be.

134
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,100
 - Is it?

135
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,380
 - Well, pencil means little penis, doesn't it, penicillus?

136
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:12,140
 - Yeah, we'll never know which he was referring to

137
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,540
 at the age of one and a half.

138
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,740
 - They both could have been quite prescient, couldn't they?

139
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,620
 - They were sort of his two leading tools, I would say.

140
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,100
 (laughing)

141
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,540
 We should say, for anyone who's already switched off,

142
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,860
 'cause we're talking about Picasso,

143
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,420
 his reputation has taken a bit of a dive,

144
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,620
 hasn't it, the last 10 years?

145
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,820
 I hadn't quite realized how much his mistresses

146
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,860
 were in basically all of his art.

147
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,460
 So it was sort of all about his sex life and his shagging.

148
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,620
 And a lot of people do criticize the way

149
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,620
 that he exploited women and, you know,

150
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:45,260
 people say women were tools to be exploited for his art.

151
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,740
 And he did once say, every time I change wives,

152
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,060
 I should burn the last one so that, you know,

153
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:50,900
 you can wipe the slate clean.

154
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,460
 - The last wife or the last painting?

155
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,300
 - The last wife.

156
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,140
 - The last wife.

157
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:54,980
 - Oh, okay.

158
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,380
 And he only actually married twice,

159
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,580
 but I think he's referring to all his mistresses then.

160
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,820
 - Two types of women, he said, goddesses and doormats.

161
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,660
 Yeah.

162
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,420
 - One of his early lovers, Francoise Chilot,

163
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,660
 is part of one of my favorite facts,

164
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,540
 which is that she later married Jonah Salk,

165
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,220
 who developed the polio jab.

166
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,060
 - Oh, that's a good fact.

167
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:14,900
 - Yeah.

168
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,460
 - So she was basically Picasso's muse,

169
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,420
 and then she married this guy who saved the world

170
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,260
 a little bit really,

171
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,260
 'cause so many people were dying of polio in those days.

172
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,300
 But people asked her later why she was attracted

173
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,220
 to such outstanding men.

174
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,060
 And she replied,

175
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,740
 "I think I am just as interesting as they.

176
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:36,500
 "Lions mate with lions, they don't mate with mice."

177
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,340
 - That's very good.

178
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,740
 - But wasn't she the only muse who left him?

179
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,060
 - Yes, she was immune to his charms.

180
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,140
 She's such a,

181
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,580
 she's a nice person to read about

182
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,540
 after I suppose all these women who ended up

183
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,100
 according to some accounts destroyed.

184
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,060
 She just said, "He didn't know me very well at all.

185
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,140
 "I'm very secretive, I smile politely, but I don't agree.

186
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,740
 "And I didn't invest my narcissism

187
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,060
 "in being represented by him.

188
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,380
 "I couldn't care less."

189
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,220
 - Yeah.

190
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,060
 - And walked off.

191
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,140
 - She wrote a book about him, a very famous book,

192
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:03,980
 "Life with Picasso."

193
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,140
 I actually read it when I was like 15 years old,

194
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,020
 I saw it in a library, it's an amazing book.

195
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,420
 And it basically caused a lot of problems

196
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,260
 when it came out,

197
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,380
 because no one wanted to know this side about Picasso.

198
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,220
 When it was released,

199
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,260
 there were 40 intellectuals who signed a petition

200
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,700
 to have it banned and scrapped and pulped.

201
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,020
 - But were there intellectuals?

202
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,860
 - Yeah, yeah.

203
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,700
 - They thought his reputation will--

204
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,100
 - Yeah, including one of the major biographers

205
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,900
 who wrote numerous volumes on Picasso's life afterwards,

206
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,380
 saying that this should be in like a tabloid

207
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,700
 as opposed to a book shop.

208
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,540
 - Is that John Richardson?

209
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,380
 - Yeah, John Richardson.

210
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,260
 - From A.R.10 Cats and Scatham.

211
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:38,180
 - Yeah, he was fuming, he was furious.

212
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,100
 But interestingly, she was asked about this

213
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,100
 in her 90s about this biography.

214
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,620
 And she said, "All these men who wrote that

215
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,780
 had never met me, didn't know what I was talking about."

216
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,060
 And she and John Richardson became really good friends,

217
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,420
 despite him slagging it off.

218
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,260
 - How interesting.

219
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:53,620
 - Yeah, and you will see her on "Capture Countdown."

220
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,300
 - When Rachel Riley's off of a tourniquet.

221
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,140
 - Yeah.

222
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:56,980
 - Yeah.

223
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,500
 And yeah, Richardson argued that his art

224
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:04,500
 was almost parodying the mitchismo of Andalusian males

225
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,500
 rather than him actually being like that.

226
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,300
 Which I don't believe.

227
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,140
 - Yes, very.

228
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,660
 - It's a really interesting thing.

229
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,900
 I always believe that when you're at work,

230
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,660
 if you're going to do it well, you mustn't have an ego.

231
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,940
 And I used to say for years and years,

232
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,500
 Picasso famously didn't behave terribly well

233
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,900
 in all sorts of ways.

234
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,900
 But I'm guessing that when he went in front of the easel,

235
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,820
 that all went away.

236
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,620
 And years later, I found this wonderful quote saying,

237
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,100
 "When I enter my studio,

238
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,580
 "I leave my personality outside the door

239
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:39,140
 "as a Muslim leaves his slippers outside the mosque."

240
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:42,220
 - He did spend a lot of time at the easel though, didn't he?

241
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,460
 Like, it's hard to find the exact number of works

242
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,940
 that he did, but it was a lot.

243
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:46,780
 - It's insane.

244
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,460
 - 147,800, but that's not exact.

245
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,100
 It's...

246
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,260
 - That's according to the official website.

247
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,940
 Yeah, they've done counting up and they,

248
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,660
 and we've lost a lot of it because in his early days,

249
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:01,620
 he used to burn his bits of art to keep his fire going.

250
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,180
 - Yeah, along with his wives.

251
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,060
 Yeah, they taught them all on the boom fire.

252
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,100
 - I worked out that that's one work of art

253
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,220
 for every five hours, 25 minutes of his life.

254
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,500
 If he started as a baby and carried on going

255
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,060
 until he met Pharrell that time.

256
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,540
 - Which once you've had your first smoke,

257
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,500
 you might as well end up with a paintbrush.

258
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,420
 He also was responsible for a major art theft,

259
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,460
 which I hadn't realized because we'd mentioned before

260
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:27,260
 on the show that he was accused of stealing the Mona Lisa.

261
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,820
 - He was interviewed by the police, right?

262
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,980
 - Yes. - He was.

263
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:30,820
 - Yes.

264
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,820
 - Because a pollinair, his friend,

265
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,340
 shopped him to the police.

266
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,180
 - Yes.

267
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,700
 - And Picasso then went to court and denied

268
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,340
 he'd ever met him, even though he's one of his best friends.

269
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,660
 - It's serious.

270
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,300
 - It's quite a low moment, isn't it?

271
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,820
 In their friendship, in their moral lives.

272
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,100
 - That's probably the best indication of the power

273
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,780
 that Picasso had that he thought he could jedi his way

274
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,620
 through, like...

275
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,180
 - The thing was, when he described the person

276
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,260
 who actually stole it, the police did a sketch

277
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,020
 and the noses on this side of his face

278
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:58,300
 and the eyebrows on this side.

279
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,540
 - But there's more to it, isn't there?

280
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,820
 - Well, there is more to it, yes, because...

281
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,220
 So that was 1911, but actually in 1907,

282
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,300
 there were these two Iberian statues

283
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,820
 stolen from the Louvre.

284
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,700
 And I think there's just been a book written

285
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,060
 which puts all the pieces together,

286
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,100
 but Picasso had first spotted them in about 1904,

287
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,300
 fallen in love with them, told all his mates,

288
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,540
 love these statues.

289
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,180
 They were put in storage.

290
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,940
 Then they disappeared.

291
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,380
 Turned out they'd been stolen by this chap called Pierre.

292
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:27,540
 And he was mates with Picasso and the dodgy Apollinaire.

293
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,180
 - He was Apollinaire's secretary, I think.

294
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,820
 - He was Apollinaire's secretary, yes.

295
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,700
 But it turned, basically,

296
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,540
 Picasso's lover at the time, Fernanda Olivier,

297
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:38,860
 said that he had all lots of artworks around his house.

298
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,060
 And then he had these two statue heads

299
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,060
 under some clothes in his wardrobe.

300
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,380
 And she asked him about them once and he said,

301
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:47,620
 "Oh, we shouldn't display them anywhere too prominent."

302
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:50,660
 And it turned out to be these two stolen statues

303
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,060
 from the Louvre.

304
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:55,580
 - But we assume that Pierre had given them to Picasso.

305
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,740
 Maybe Picasso had asked him to steal them.

306
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,940
 Some people say that Pierre couldn't have carried them

307
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,260
 both out under his coat, which is what he claimed.

308
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,700
 So maybe Picasso was there.

309
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,140
 - It's a lot easier to steal stuff

310
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,820
 from the Louvre in those days, wasn't it?

311
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,980
 - I was a piece of this, yeah.

312
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,620
 - Yeah, the lousy security, didn't they?

313
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,020
 - Yeah, I think there was a story

314
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,660
 that Pierre once once said to his girlfriend,

315
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,020
 "I'm going to the Louvre today.

316
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,620
 Do you want me to pick anything else for you?"

317
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,980
 (laughing)

318
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:22,460
 And then ironically, Picasso is the most stolen artist

319
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,800
 in history now.

320
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,380
 But I think it's largely 'cause he made so much, right?

321
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,580
 - You can't help stealing one, you pick up a sketch.

322
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,940
 - Yeah, and following the secretary

323
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,300
 had something to do with it, I'm sure.

324
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,700
 Shifting his stuff back to...

325
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,380
 - So even when he was in his 70s and 80s,

326
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:40,860
 he was quite a womanizer, Picasso.

327
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,860
 And whenever anyone came to his house who he fancied,

328
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,140
 he would make a little sculpture of a little man

329
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,140
 with an enormous phallus and then give it to them

330
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,140
 as like a love gift.

331
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,460
 - Right.

332
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:56,540
 - Did that work a high percentage of the time?

333
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,580
 - It didn't work so often because he quite often

334
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,740
 did it in front of his wife.

335
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:05,500
 And anyone who'd been given this phallic item

336
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,940
 was not allowed back in the house.

337
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,060
 'Cause his wife would just be like,

338
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,940
 "Well, you're obviously not coming back."

339
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:11,780
 - Yeah, yeah.

340
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:14,020
 - And again, this is going to John Richardson.

341
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:14,860
 - John Richardson.

342
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,380
 - To say, given all these sort of anecdotal things

343
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:22,100
 and the naughtiness that he was an extraordinary painter

344
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,220
 and those two statues he mentioned inspired him

345
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,460
 for Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.

346
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,020
 - Yeah, which is a great painting.

347
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,580
 - Is described by John Golding, the art critic,

348
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,580
 as the greatest painting of the 20th century.

349
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,740
 It's so influential.

350
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,340
 - It's kind of cool for him to take,

351
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,380
 like looking back at it now,

352
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,220
 if the ends justify the means,

353
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,740
 it's fine that he stole those things

354
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,660
 if they inspired those great works.

355
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,820
 - Yeah, and no one gave us just about

356
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,780
 two random Iberian statues

357
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,460
 from 2000 years ago in storage.

358
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,580
 - Remind me to not have James as my lawyer.

359
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:54,060
 We were going to do a fact about them

360
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,540
 in the podcast the next week.

361
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:59,260
 - He used to make some of his paints as well.

362
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,700
 There's a particular brown that he made,

363
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,900
 which we only now know what the secret source was.

364
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,740
 - HP.

365
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:10,180
 - No, not quite.

366
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:14,060
 - It was his three-year-old daughter's poo.

367
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,380
 - Oh, come on, Dan, no.

368
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,420
 - Poocasso, they called the article.

369
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:23,540
 Yeah, he used to say that the best feces as well

370
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:26,860
 would be from a mother who the infant was being breastfed.

371
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:27,940
 - Well, I would say that like,

372
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,060
 this is a three-year-old child, right?

373
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,700
 But definitely the poo of a much younger baby

374
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,820
 is a color that you can't really see anywhere else

375
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,140
 in the world. - Oh, true, yes.

376
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,140
 - I never see the felt tip the same color

377
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,460
 as a nappy from a two-month-old.

378
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:44,740
 - Well, you've seen my tie, though, it's very similar.

379
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:50,140
 - Listeners, John is wearing a tie,

380
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,900
 which is like 50 shades of feces.

381
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:59,180
 - But nice, orangey baby feces, the harmless kind.

382
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,500
 - He also, I mean, we're talking about his paintings,

383
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,620
 but he predicted in his own lifetime

384
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,060
 that he would be more known for his poetry than his paintings.

385
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,420
 - Poocasso. - Yeah, after his death.

386
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,020
 He wrote over 300 poems,

387
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,780
 and he also wrote two surrealist plays.

388
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,100
 - He can't really have believed,

389
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,100
 'cause he was incredibly famous for his paintings

390
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,140
 throughout his life.

391
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,020
 And no one was going, "Do you know what, Poocasso?

392
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,540
 "People should make more of your poems.

393
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,860
 "Did he really think?" - Well, he just,

394
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,340
 he probably thought they'll forget about it one day

395
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,860
 and my poems will live on after me.

396
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,300
 - I think this is a common theme with artists, though.

397
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,940
 You know, rock bands who always pick the wrong songs

398
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,340
 gonna be successful and hate the one that's famous.

399
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,340
 - Yeah, John Richardson, as always,

400
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,620
 they're asking him in interviews about,

401
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,140
 "Hey, I've done cuts to this countdown."

402
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,780
 And they never ask him about his Poocasso,

403
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,140
 but at first they don't.

404
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,460
 - But like that author, Karen Doyle, quote,

405
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,860
 "You must have touched before that if in 100 years

406
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,500
 "I'm remembered just for Sherlock Holmes,

407
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,580
 "I would have considered my life a failure."

408
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:55,300
 - Yeah, sorry, mate, embrace it.

409
00:14:55,300 --> 00:15:04,700
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James.

410
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,780
 - Okay, my fact this week

411
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,180
 is that the national song of St. Helena

412
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,820
 was written by a man who had never been there.

413
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:14,540
 He based his lyrics on a postcard that he had seen.

414
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,380
 - Incredible.

415
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,220
 Let's hear it.

416
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:19,020
 - ♪ God save our great, no ♪

417
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,820
 That is the national anthem of St. Helena

418
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,540
 because it's a British territory.

419
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:26,580
 - So did he base it on the stamp of the postcard?

420
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:30,460
 - He wrote another anthem called "My St. Helena Island"

421
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,540
 and is kind of the de facto anthem.

422
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,060
 It's not the official national anthem,

423
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,900
 but it's the one that all saints, as they're known as,

424
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,660
 in St. Helena would sing.

425
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,540
 And it was written by an American

426
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,420
 who is better known for his appearances

427
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,580
 on the eight out of 10 cats does countdown

428
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,140
 called David Mitchell.

429
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:50,380
 - It's stunning.

430
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:53,420
 - David Mitchell, he was nicknamed Old Saddle Bags

431
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,740
 and he was a DJ on a sentient island,

432
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,860
 which is, I was gonna say nearby, it's not nearby,

433
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,380
 but it's the nearest place to St. Helena,

434
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,700
 St. Helena's in the middle of the ocean.

435
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,300
 He became friends with some people from St. Helena

436
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,860
 and they suggested that he writes a song for them.

437
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,340
 And he was a bit reluctant to do that

438
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,300
 'cause he's never been there,

439
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:15,180
 but they sent him some postcards and he wrote this song.

440
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,020
 And that's what happened.

441
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,860
 It goes, "My heart is drifting southwards

442
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,660
 "to my home down in the sea,

443
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,060
 "to the Isle of St. Helena,

444
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,260
 "where my loved ones wait for me.

445
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,580
 "We're having a lovely time,

446
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:27,100
 "whether it's changeable, food is awful, wish you were here."

447
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,420
 (laughing)

448
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,260
 - That's great.

449
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,100
 - Genius.

450
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:31,940
 - It's really good.

451
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,180
 And he recorded them officially, the songs,

452
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,500
 and they made records of it.

453
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,260
 And he sent a bunch of records

454
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,780
 and pictures of himself to St. Helena as part of like,

455
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,420
 "Here's the merch that you can have."

456
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,380
 But he's not really known anywhere,

457
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:45,500
 even in his hometown, in Memphis.

458
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,700
 But yeah, he's someone who's still around.

459
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,060
 I mean, it's not that long ago, right?

460
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:49,900
 So--

461
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,220
 - I think he's dead, isn't he?

462
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:52,060
 - Oh, okay, the site, I saw.

463
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:55,140
 - I think his family, he's recently dead, I think.

464
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:55,980
 - Right, okay.

465
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,300
 - But I might be wrong about that, so I'll check.

466
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,340
 - But nobody's blown sick arse smoke in his face yet,

467
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,460
 so you can't tell.

468
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,380
 (laughing)

469
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,500
 - It's interesting in postcards,

470
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,620
 because both Matisse and Picasso used postcards

471
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,420
 to inspire some of their greatest work.

472
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,260
 - Did they?

473
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,500
 - So Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, for example,

474
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,500
 was based on a postcard that Picasso found, yeah.

475
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,340
 - Was it?

476
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,660
 I did not know that last night.

477
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,900
 - And did you know that it's not the only

478
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,700
 national anthem or national song,

479
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,660
 'cause it's not strictly the national anthem

480
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,500
 that was written by somebody who'd never been there?

481
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,340
 Did you know that?

482
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:30,500
 Guinea Bissau on the West Coast of Africa.

483
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,700
 The music was written by a Chinese guy called Xiao Hei,

484
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:38,860
 because the words were written by a separatist leader

485
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,620
 of the African party called Amal Khakabral,

486
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,620
 who was the leader of the African party

487
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,460
 for the independence of Guinea Bissau and Cape Verde.

488
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,300
 - Wow.

489
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,900
 - And in 1963, he went on a delegation to China

490
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,620
 and they met this guy, Xiao Hei,

491
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,180
 and asked him to write the music.

492
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,020
 - Really?

493
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,500
 - Yeah, literally last year in 2024,

494
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,820
 Xi Jinping held a welcome ceremony

495
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,460
 for the current president of Guinea Bissau,

496
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,940
 who's a guy called Imaro Sosoko Mbalo,

497
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,460
 and they played the anthem.

498
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,340
 This is our well-beloved motherland.

499
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,860
 - It feels like it's got an edge to it

500
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,700
 when you're being hosted by Xi Jinping

501
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,420
 as the president of Tiny Guinea Bissau.

502
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,980
 And he's saying, here's your national anthem,

503
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,940
 we wrote it, by the way, don't forget it.

504
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:23,860
 - Well, if anyone doesn't know where Saint Helena is,

505
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:27,660
 basically from Guinea Bissau, head west,

506
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,500
 and it's pretty much the first place you get to,

507
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,900
 is like a tiny island in the middle of the Atlantic.

508
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,540
 - It's so isolated when you look on a map.

509
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,820
 If you go on your Google Maps or whatever on your phone,

510
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,860
 it is insanely isolated.

511
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,860
 - We cannot find a way of getting there,

512
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,060
 we'll get a lot when you try a direction.

513
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,740
 - Exactly, and there's a lot of,

514
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,220
 I watched a few tourist videos for it,

515
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:49,140
 where they said, you can achieve all you need to see

516
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,900
 in a single day, but why not stay for three?

517
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,060
 It's just such a...

518
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,420
 - Well, 'cause that's when the next boat leaves.

519
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,900
 - Yeah, possibly, right, yeah.

520
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,420
 - I should just say thanks to my sister-in-law's best friend,

521
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,500
 who gave me a lot of information about Saint Helena,

522
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,860
 'cause she lives there.

523
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:07,700
 The national dish of Saint Helena is tomato paste sandwiches.

524
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,980
 They're called bread and dance.

525
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,340
 And the idea is that if you're at a wedding,

526
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:15,020
 there'll be a big sort of table with a load of goodies on,

527
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,260
 and everyone will dance around it,

528
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,620
 and then you'll eat something from the table,

529
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,060
 and it's usually some bread and stuff.

530
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:23,300
 - Dipton, tomato tapenade. - Yeah, pretty much.

531
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,660
 Because it's really hard to get a hold of fresh stuff there.

532
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,780
 Basically once a month, you get a boat that comes in

533
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,140
 with fresh fruit and vegetables,

534
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,740
 and everyone legs it to the shop.

535
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:35,980
 Six pack of watsits, which is £2 at Poundland,

536
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,700
 in the UK, is £4 on Saint Helena,

537
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,740
 and a box of corn flakes that's £2.85 in the UK

538
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,620
 is £7 in Saint Helena.

539
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,380
 - But there's not that much else to spend your money on,

540
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,420
 so you're not complaining, are you?

541
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,660
 - No, there's not a lot going on.

542
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,580
 But two very famous residents,

543
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,140
 as most people, if they think of Saint Helena,

544
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:57,100
 Napoleon being exiled there after Waterloo in 1815.

545
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,460
 And the other famous resident, you know who that is?

546
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,780
 - No. - Jonathan the Giant Tortoise.

547
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,340
 - Oh, yeah. - Who lives in the grounds

548
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,420
 of the governor's official residence, and he's 192.

549
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,340
 - Jonathan's still alive. - Yeah.

550
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,220
 - Still going pretty amazing. - Yeah.

551
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,860
 - Was five when Queen Victoria was crowned.

552
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,940
 - Probably he's died quite a few times,

553
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,460
 and they've just replaced him with another tortoise.

554
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,020
 - No, no. - Like SEO trot.

555
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,340
 - Yeah. - He's not.

556
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:24,380
 He's terribly well, if I've got a quote about him.

557
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,220
 - From him? - Yeah.

558
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,740
 No, it's from his vet.

559
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,700
 - He said, "Cowabunga, dude."

560
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,220
 - It's from his vet.

561
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:33,900
 Jonathan is now blind, but he still has a tremendous libido.

562
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,300
 - No, so that's your Picasso note.

563
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,900
 - Oh, yeah, no, sorry.

564
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,660
 - Kind of started off with the East India Company,

565
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:47,660
 who were doing lots of trade with the East and with Europe,

566
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,060
 and they needed somewhere to stop on the way,

567
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,780
 'cause there's no Suez Canal in those days,

568
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,940
 so you go all the way around Africa,

569
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:56,980
 and they would always call it St Helena on the way,

570
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:00,620
 and eventually they decided to put a colony down there,

571
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,660
 and the first laws included God was to be worshipped

572
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,420
 and served diligently,

573
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,780
 and semen were not allowed to stay on the island

574
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,300
 without permission.

575
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,140
 - Oh, really?

576
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,300
 - If you were caught harboring a sailor,

577
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,060
 you'd be fined five pounds.

578
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,300
 - What's wrong with sailors?

579
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,060
 Should be inviting people, I would have thought.

580
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,740
 - Yeah, I think they just didn't want anyone

581
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,860
 coming on the island who wasn't supposed to be there.

582
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:20,700
 - Okay. - Right?

583
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,380
 - Given it was only sailors who were going by.

584
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,820
 - Yeah, yeah, who else are you gonna get, swimmers?

585
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,660
 - Yeah.

586
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,140
 - Do you know what the postcode is, on St Helena?

587
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,420
 - No, that's good, what?

588
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:33,020
 - Well, it's STHL1ZZ, the point being,

589
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,020
 it's a Royal Mail postcode,

590
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,580
 and it had its own postcode, I think,

591
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:42,140
 but apparently people kept writing to St Helena,

592
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:45,100
 and Mail kept going to St Helens in Merseyside,

593
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:49,620
 which is quite actually quite a long way to go from there.

594
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,460
 - That's brilliant.

595
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,860
 - Hard to know what to do with that mail

596
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:52,980
 when it drops through your doorstep,

597
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,900
 so they go from a Royal Mail postcode.

598
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,660
 - 'Cause that was the only way you could really get there

599
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:00,580
 for a very long time, which was the RMS St Helena,

600
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,300
 and it was the Royal Mail ship

601
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,620
 that would bring all the post over,

602
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,300
 so you would sort of jump onto that in order to get over.

603
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,700
 - And someone tried to post themselves

604
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,220
 out of St Helena, actually, didn't they?

605
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,060
 - Did they?

606
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:13,180
 - Yes, so another thing that was useful by the Brits

607
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,820
 was in the Boar War, 1900 to 1902,

608
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:20,100
 they sent 6,000 Boar prisoners of war to this tiny place.

609
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,660
 God knows how they suddenly accommodated them,

610
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:26,540
 and there was one prisoner of war called Andrés Smorenberg,

611
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:29,320
 who made this crate, and he wrote on it,

612
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,740
 "Curios Only" inside here, and then he climbed in,

613
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,860
 and he got the crate put in a place

614
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:38,900
 where it was gonna be picked up by a passing mail ship,

615
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,300
 put a fake address on in London,

616
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,140
 filled it with like clothes and matches and water,

617
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,820
 and bedded down for the 20-day journey.

618
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,740
 And sadly, even though, that's what I said,

619
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:53,860
 even though he marked it with care and this side up,

620
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,460
 it was tossed around quite badly,

621
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,300
 and he was very severely concussed,

622
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,100
 and then when they landed at Ascension Island,

623
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:03,500
 they got out sort of an unconscious damaged man

624
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,180
 and sent him straight back to St Helena.

625
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,540
 - Oh, so he didn't die, okay.

626
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,780
 - He didn't die, no, but--

627
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:10,340
 - They left him in someone's bin area for a few days.

628
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,900
 (laughing)

629
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:15,260
 - So St Helena and the RMS St Helena, the boat

630
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,460
 that you used to get there on,

631
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,860
 both, of course, named after the actual St Helena,

632
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,380
 which I'm sure you knew,

633
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:24,700
 the mother of the Emperor Constantine, and also a saint,

634
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:28,300
 famous for discovering parts of the true cross,

635
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,460
 which she excavated from the Holy Land

636
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,260
 when she was visiting there.

637
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,300
 She excavated three crosses, actually,

638
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,340
 but she knew she'd got the real one

639
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,740
 when it created a miracle

640
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:40,540
 by curing a sick woman who touched it.

641
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:43,740
 But not only that, she also discovered the true nails

642
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:47,540
 that were holding the cross and Jesus onto the cross.

643
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:50,060
 - The true hammer that was used to bang the nails in.

644
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,860
 - No, no, that isn't mentioned in my research,

645
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:56,260
 but the nails were there, and also uniquely,

646
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:59,900
 the Holy Rope that Jesus was tied to the cross with,

647
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:03,900
 which is unique, it's the only relic of the Holy Rope.

648
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,100
 - How interesting, because I was taught at school

649
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:10,060
 that he was nailed and that the other thieves were tied,

650
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,140
 and he wasn't tied.

651
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,300
 - It could have been one of the thieves is--

652
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,580
 - I mean, it's all made up, isn't it?

653
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,460
 - Well, we don't know where she was born,

654
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,300
 but that's the thing, and there's an old British legend

655
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:22,020
 that she was a British princess.

656
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,020
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

657
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,660
 - The daughter of old King Cole of Colchester.

658
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,220
 - Of old Mary the Old Soul, babe.

659
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:31,820
 - Yes, and Colchester has, on its coat of arms,

660
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,580
 it has the three nails that she discovered.

661
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,420
 - Really?

662
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,260
 - Yeah.

663
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,620
 - Oh, wow.

664
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:37,460
 - That's very good.

665
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,620
 Well, this is interesting.

666
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:41,820
 So where do you think the second largest collection

667
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,300
 of St. Helinian's saints?

668
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,140
 - Saints is what they're called.

669
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,100
 - The saints are.

670
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,940
 - Well, I'm gonna say St. Helin's, I reckon.

671
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:52,060
 - And Merseyside, they got distracted.

672
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:55,460
 - It's not, it's Swindon.

673
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,300
 - Is it?

674
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,140
 - No.

675
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:00,540
 - Swindolina, as it's known to the locals in Swindon.

676
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,860
 - Oh, no.

677
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,060
 - Like St. Helina, Swindolina.

678
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,500
 - Swindolina, there's about a fifth

679
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,020
 of what the current population

680
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,940
 in actual St. Helina is in Swindon.

681
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,460
 So there's like 800 people there.

682
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,300
 - What are they doing there?

683
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,980
 - Well, they were all given British nationalship

684
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,020
 in 2002 after the Falkland Wars.

685
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:19,220
 And so if you want to go meet locals from St. Helina,

686
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,060
 go to Swindon.

687
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:20,900
 - How cool.

688
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,940
 - Didn't John Richardson move to Swindon?

689
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:23,780
 - He did move to Swindon.

690
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,860
 - He did move there, he moved there

691
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,980
 because he worked out that it had the best transport links

692
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,060
 in the whole of the UK.

693
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,260
 - Yeah, to get into London

694
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,220
 and to get to the gigs he'd needed to.

695
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,900
 That's right, God, he's more prolific

696
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,620
 than we've given him credit for, really.

697
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,980
 - Oh, we're trying to get him on this show.

698
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,260
 What's going on there?

699
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:41,840
 (upbeat music)

700
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:46,100
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three.

701
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,620
 And that is my fact.

702
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:51,140
 My fact this week is that to go into

703
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:54,700
 the BBC's sound department in Made of Vale,

704
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,460
 you have to walk down a set of steps

705
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,400
 that are each one third concrete,

706
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,220
 one third carpet and one third wood.

707
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,820
 This is amazing.

708
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:06,060
 I saw this fact, I should say,

709
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,960
 when I was just scrolling through Facebook earlier this year

710
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,540
 and Tony Wei, who I'm friends with, he's a movie star.

711
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,660
 He's in The Edge of Tomorrow, the Tom Cruise movie.

712
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,620
 - All right, Plank.

713
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:19,340
 - Yeah, he's also in a lot of British sitcoms,

714
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:22,900
 black books and anything you can think of after life

715
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,980
 with Ricky Gervais, he's a great actor.

716
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:28,220
 He was there and he took a photo event and showed it

717
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,060
 and it's pretty amazing.

718
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:32,460
 So when I say that the staircase is a third of each.

719
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,980
 - It's like you've got a runner down the middle

720
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,620
 but either side is different.

721
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:36,940
 - That's a very good way of putting it.

722
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:39,540
 Yeah, so this is where the BBC do their foley,

723
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,980
 which is the sound effects,

724
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:44,620
 the extra noises that go into TV, radio and movies.

725
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:47,340
 And they have a whole bottom floor there,

726
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,740
 which is pretty extraordinary when you get a walk through it.

727
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:52,700
 So I watched a video of Sean Keveney doing it,

728
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,540
 the radio.

729
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,780
 - Another friend of yours, is he done?

730
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,700
 - Actually is, yeah, he actually is.

731
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,860
 So they have a kitchen that's set up and it's all mic'd up

732
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:03,140
 and so you can make tea and you can slam cupboards

733
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,020
 and you can move bottles.

734
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,660
 So anytime they need that, that's all done there.

735
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:09,940
 They have a room where it's just full of seaweed and sand

736
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,740
 and little mats that you can walk on

737
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,340
 that can create the sound of the ocean,

738
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,380
 the forest with the magnetic tapes or compressed snow

739
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,300
 when you throw the mat on top of sand.

740
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,300
 - Seaweed. - That's great.

741
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,140
 - Yeah, I mean, now that you say that.

742
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,380
 - What noise is the seaweed making?

743
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,220
 - Yeah.

744
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,060
 - Is that just the sound of seaweed?

745
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:24,900
 - That's a really good point.

746
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,300
 It must be artificial.

747
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,100
 It looked exactly like seaweed in the-

748
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,740
 - Is it seaweed inside the water?

749
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,220
 - No, no, this is just on the floor.

750
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,060
 - That the seaweed would just dry out in about two minutes.

751
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,380
 - Well, they've probably got a seaweed person

752
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,540
 who, the interns job on your first day.

753
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,060
 - I know it wouldn't have been seaweed.

754
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,940
 - So when I worked in radio and when I started,

755
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,980
 we used to use quarter inch tape, recording tape

756
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:47,260
 for lots of effects like walking through grass.

757
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,900
 - Yeah. - You'd rustle that.

758
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,740
 - Well, that's what they had though.

759
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:52,380
 Yeah, all this tape that was in piles.

760
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,100
 And I messaged Tony to say,

761
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,580
 is there anything else that you saw there?

762
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:58,060
 And he said there's also a foley coat.

763
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,420
 So it's made of different fabrics.

764
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,140
 It's a coat you put on, made of different fabrics

765
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,460
 with different kinds of zips and fastenings attached

766
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:06,220
 to replicate any kind of clothing sound that you want,

767
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,780
 but all in one coat.

768
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,620
 - That looks like it would be a really cool coat.

769
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:10,740
 - No, Anna.

770
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,140
 How often have you been getting off a train

771
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,580
 and you're like, I need my ticket

772
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,460
 and you've only got five pockets.

773
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,500
 You've no idea which pocket it's in.

774
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,580
 - And you're making a mad array of noises.

775
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,860
 (laughing)

776
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:23,860
 Sorry, guys.

777
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,620
 - So I wonder if that foley coat was used,

778
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,300
 there's a very famous story about Mrs. Dale's diary,

779
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:32,260
 which was the sort of forerunner of the arches way back when.

780
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,900
 They were trying to get the sound

781
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,380
 of somebody opening a parcel.

782
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,020
 Mrs. Dale was delivered a parcel.

783
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,380
 They tried paper and sound like it.

784
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:41,180
 'Cause famously in sound effects,

785
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,860
 often you think of a helicopter,

786
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:45,100
 sounds like (imitates helicopter sounds)

787
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,100
 which we used to make using what's called a double ender,

788
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,780
 which is a wire with two brass plugs on the end.

789
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,620
 - Right.

790
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,460
 - It sounds like a helicopter,

791
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,260
 'cause what a helicopter actually sounds like

792
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,180
 is not like what you think a helicopter's supposed

793
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,020
 to sound like.

794
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,580
 - No, it's just very, very loud hum.

795
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,140
 - It's a loud engine, yeah.

796
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,420
 - You can't really hear what you're saying, yeah.

797
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:03,620
 - So anyway, somebody undid their zip as an experiment

798
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,100
 and the producer said, what's that?

799
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,220
 - That's an amazing sound.

800
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,220
 That's perfect parcel opening.

801
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:12,340
 So when the script comes, Mrs. Dale, oh, hello there.

802
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,180
 (imitates helicopter sounds)

803
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,620
 Oh, what have you got in there?

804
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,460
 She said.

805
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,180
 (laughing)

806
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,540
 - Okay, I'm seeing where the double ender name

807
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,380
 came from.

808
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,940
 (laughing)

809
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,580
 I really hadn't quite realized

810
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,580
 that what being a Foley artist entailed,

811
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,040
 and I think I want it as a job.

812
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:30,620
 It's so cool if you're working in the films.

813
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,540
 Basically, they'll be sent the film

814
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,620
 and they'll come into a room and they've got all their props

815
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,460
 and often they've collected,

816
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,860
 I think all Foley artists collect just like hundreds

817
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,380
 and hundreds of different props.

818
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,900
 Bring them in, lay them all out.

819
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,620
 And they've got a script which tells them vaguely

820
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,460
 what sounds to make,

821
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,740
 but then they watch the film and live,

822
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:48,020
 they try to imitate what the person's doing.

823
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,700
 So you see them sort of jerking around,

824
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,300
 clutching at something quickly.

825
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,460
 Stomp, stomp, stomp.

826
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:55,060
 They have to grab a shoe, reach for a cloth.

827
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,140
 It's amazing, isn't it?

828
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:56,980
 - It is amazing.

829
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:00,020
 And those items, if it makes the perfect sound,

830
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,900
 you just want to keep it forever.

831
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,620
 And they get passed down from generation to generation.

832
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:09,620
 So I was reading an interview with someone called Alison D. Moore

833
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:13,420
 and her former partner in Foley had retired

834
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,900
 and he gave her a copper towel bar

835
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,220
 with a koi fish on each end.

836
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,340
 And when you twisted it,

837
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:22,660
 it made a screech that sounded exactly like a startled cat.

838
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:25,940
 And he was like, this is my pride and joy.

839
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,660
 I take it everywhere I go,

840
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,620
 but you can have it now I've retired.

841
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,220
 - Wow. - So good.

842
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,380
 - The BBC, I wondered, John,

843
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,260
 when you were saying that about the Foley sounds,

844
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,580
 was that live radio,

845
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,980
 the Foley was happening live along with it?

846
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:41,180
 - I did very little actual live radio.

847
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:45,700
 No, you just add the sound effects as you went along.

848
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,580
 Well, you were recording live, of course.

849
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,860
 And it was a famous, not famous to you,

850
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:52,100
 but to me, I used to do a radio show

851
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,700
 called The News Hudlines with Roy Hardy.

852
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,180
 It was incredibly quick on the draw.

853
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:58,100
 A bit like a sort of Lee Mack of his day, very fast.

854
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:02,460
 And there was a sketch that involved a fridge.

855
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,740
 And in the script,

856
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:07,020
 the studio manager saw SFX door opens.

857
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,740
 And that's a standard BBC sound effect

858
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,260
 because the rattle of the door knob.

859
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,580
 - Yeah, yeah, like that.

860
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,660
 - And so, it's a,

861
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,300
 Rory said, I'll just look in the fridge.

862
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,140
 And there was a,

863
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,460
 he said, oh, a wooden fridge.

864
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,940
 It's a wonderful moment.

865
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,340
 - It is amazing, but it was really,

866
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:26,100
 it was a very strong thing with the BBC for live radio,

867
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,780
 particularly comedy shows,

868
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:28,900
 like The Goon Show.

869
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,700
 And there was a famous incident where

870
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,260
 in the script, Nettie Seagoon,

871
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,420
 who was played by Harry Seagoon,

872
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:36,460
 was to be hit by a sock full of custard.

873
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,220
 And they tried all these different sounds.

874
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,060
 They couldn't get it.

875
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,460
 And Spike Milligan got so frustrated during rehearsal

876
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,620
 that he took his sock off.

877
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:43,780
 He grabbed an assistant,

878
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:46,780
 sent them to the BBC canteen to fill it up with custard,

879
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,460
 which they did, brought it back,

880
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,620
 walloped Harry Seagoon over the head with it.

881
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,900
 And it still didn't get the sound that they need.

882
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,460
 But that story got out.

883
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,580
 And the BBC got lots of complaints

884
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:59,660
 because this was in the last year of post-war rationing.

885
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:01,780
 And they said, you are wasting good custard.

886
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,580
 - Do they not drink it afterwards out of the cell?

887
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,740
 - Well, regardless of what they did.

888
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,580
 - No, that is wasteful.

889
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,140
 - 'Cause they usually say on those programmes,

890
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:10,580
 "Don't worry, the food was shared amongst the crew

891
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,740
 "afterwards." - Yes, yeah.

892
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,700
 - Those bizarre sound effects,

893
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,700
 I remember I used to briefly please the programme

894
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,620
 called The Burgess Wave,

895
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:20,140
 written by David Romick and Andrew Marshall.

896
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,500
 And they used to take great pleasure

897
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,580
 in writing sound effects for impossible to do.

898
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:27,260
 And I remember one was SFX,

899
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:30,500
 Genghis Khan slices somebody's stomach off.

900
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,700
 - Oh, wow. - It was quite a while,

901
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,420
 that took to get right. - What did you do for that?

902
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,260
 - What did you do?

903
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,100
 - Well, I went to the canteen.

904
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,700
 I got a fresh stomach.

905
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,260
 (all laughing)

906
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,020
 It is interesting.

907
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:47,020
 It's one of those unsung things in movies and television

908
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:49,820
 because without those little sounds,

909
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:52,420
 it doesn't have heft at all.

910
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,940
 When we did the first episode of Splitting Image,

911
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,660
 we decided not to have a laugh track

912
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,340
 'cause I don't know why,

913
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:01,260
 but no time, I think.

914
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,020
 And it seemed completely boring

915
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,500
 'cause we used to make Splitting Image

916
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,940
 by recording the voice track first

917
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,820
 and then they puppeteer's mime to it.

918
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,620
 And of course, they're made of rubber.

919
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:14,420
 So when a puppet touched the desk

920
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,740
 and it was a pre-recorded thing, nothing happened.

921
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,660
 So the two guys, two sound guys,

922
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:21,060
 absolute geniuses stood up literally all night

923
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:23,620
 doing all that, you know, touching the table,

924
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:26,140
 banging each other's heads, scratching their clothes.

925
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:28,220
 And suddenly it comes alive.

926
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,660
 No, it was an amazing thing

927
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:33,220
 'cause actually we owe the whole existence

928
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,660
 of Splitting Image to those two guys.

929
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,100
 - Yeah.

930
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:39,740
 I was talking about this Foley artist called Alison D. Moore.

931
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:40,900
 I read an interview with her.

932
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:41,740
 It was really interesting.

933
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,940
 She said that there are more astronauts on earth

934
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:46,180
 than people working in Foley at the moment.

935
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,020
 - What?

936
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:50,660
 - So I reckon that there's about 100 people doing Foley.

937
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:54,140
 And there are more people who've been in space than that.

938
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:56,460
 She said that they can literally change the rating

939
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:59,820
 of a film by the sounds that they put in.

940
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:04,740
 So if there is, for instance, an oral sex scene,

941
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:07,060
 if they make it sound really filthy,

942
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:10,420
 then it can go up from a 15 to an 18.

943
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,460
 - But what's the, what's the, is it just like...

944
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:16,220
 - That's normal oral sex, that's how that sounds.

945
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:19,020
 - I think that downgrades it to like a U if you do that.

946
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:23,700
 - It is important to say that the Foley is a specific thing,

947
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,940
 which is something that's made on the spot.

948
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,380
 Isn't it not like a recording?

949
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,220
 - Yeah.

950
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:29,060
 - That doesn't count as a Foley.

951
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:31,660
 - You get lots of sound effects artists.

952
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:34,300
 - But I just wanted to give some people a hint

953
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:37,500
 of things, recordings that could be useful in other contexts.

954
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,660
 So for example, the roar of a leopard

955
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,940
 sounds like someone roughly sawing wood.

956
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:42,780
 - Okay.

957
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,620
 - Which is useful.

958
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,700
 - Okay, good to know.

959
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:47,060
 - Bill Bailey said, without the beat in the background,

960
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:49,420
 jazz basically sounds like an armadillo

961
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,140
 was let loose on the keyboard.

962
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,700
 So if you wanted that sound...

963
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:56,660
 - It's amazing though, because since BBC started

964
00:34:56,660 --> 00:35:00,340
 recording their stuff and other massive production studios,

965
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:03,300
 there's these huge Foley archives that now exist.

966
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,820
 And a lot of them have been made available to the public.

967
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:08,980
 So the BBC have over 33,000 of its sound effects

968
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:11,340
 that are just on a website you can download

969
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,500
 and use as part of whatever you want to use.

970
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,260
 It's open to the public.

971
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,700
 Hanna-Barbera also is used a lot.

972
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:21,140
 So Hanna-Barbera that made the Flintstones and so on.

973
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:24,020
 Their sounds have been used in so many places

974
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,620
 you wouldn't expect multiple Mario Kart

975
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,740
 and Mario video games have the sounds

976
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,420
 that would have been used in the Flintstones

977
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,540
 that are sort of peppered all the way through.

978
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,380
 - Really?

979
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,220
 - Yeah.

980
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,540
 - And they made those sounds by getting a pterodactyl

981
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,820
 to put their beak on a record player.

982
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:40,060
 (laughing)

983
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:43,900
 - Yeah, but it's, yeah, it's pretty wild.

984
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,300
 And we missed, I think it was the first 10 years

985
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:49,020
 of any kind of recording with BBC radio

986
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:52,340
 until the arrival of a thing called the Blatner phone.

987
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,260
 It was only one machine that was recording

988
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,860
 all the radio output at the time

989
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,500
 that was coming from the BBC.

990
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,900
 And it wasn't a great recording necessarily,

991
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:03,260
 but the machine, the spools that would hold the tape

992
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,700
 were ginormous and the tape would be traveling

993
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,660
 at really high speeds.

994
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,140
 So it would be traveling at five feet per second

995
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:11,020
 to record it, which was really dangerous

996
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:13,580
 for anyone who had to monitor the tape

997
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,420
 because if it broke off,

998
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:18,180
 it would be like shrapnel shooting out the tape.

999
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,980
 And it was like a razor's edge.

1000
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,700
 You would be cut to pieces if it shot.

1001
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,140
 - Oh, like a ninja?

1002
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:23,980
 - Yeah, yeah.

1003
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:24,820
 So it was incredibly dangerous.

1004
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:25,660
 - That's a great murder mystery.

1005
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:26,660
 That should be a Jonathan Creek episode.

1006
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,020
 - Yes, that's true, yeah.

1007
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,940
 And that would happen, it would be more dangerous

1008
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:32,380
 because eventually they got two of these machines,

1009
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,940
 the Blatner phone, which meant that they could change tape

1010
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,940
 on one while recording on the other.

1011
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,740
 So that was a seriously dangerous thing.

1012
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,060
 They used to have to wear heavy gloves

1013
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:42,060
 and any time they were doing something

1014
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:42,900
 that looked a bit delicate,

1015
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,460
 they would run to the other side of the room

1016
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,340
 in case it exploded on them.

1017
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,700
 - Hang on, presumably when you change the tape,

1018
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,820
 you stop the, you stop the tape.

1019
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,780
 - Yeah, yeah, but just, I mean, the think and overheat,

1020
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:53,780
 they had incidences basically, where it just got too much.

1021
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,500
 - It was the most dangerous job in the world

1022
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,060
 working for the BBC in the '50s.

1023
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:57,900
 - It was.

1024
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,740
 - I'm the '70s.

1025
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:59,980
 (laughing)

1026
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:02,560
 (upbeat music)

1027
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:07,260
 - Okay, it is time for a final fact of the show

1028
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,020
 and that is Anna.

1029
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,980
 - My fact this week is that every year,

1030
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:14,420
 tens of thousands of people attend Rwanda's

1031
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:17,620
 annual gorilla baby naming ceremony.

1032
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:21,060
 - Oh, that sounds good. - Isn't it sweet?

1033
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,060
 It is good.

1034
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,300
 - Is it sweet?

1035
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,220
 - It is sweet, yes.

1036
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,460
 Yeah, yeah, nothing dark to it.

1037
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:29,420
 Quita izina, which means to give a name in Nkinyawanda,

1038
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,580
 which is the language.

1039
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,500
 And this is so cool.

1040
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,300
 It's this whole full week of activities devoted to gorillas

1041
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:39,060
 and it's all about their conservation and their protection

1042
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,940
 'cause there's a huge deal in Rwanda.

1043
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,900
 And the highlight is this naming ceremony

1044
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:46,060
 where they've got a huge, really cool looking stage,

1045
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:49,460
 which is a wicker sculpture of a gorilla

1046
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:52,100
 or a bamboo sculpture of a gorilla the size of a house.

1047
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:55,860
 And then a celebrity and all researchers.

1048
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:56,980
 - Who's the celebrity?

1049
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,340
 - Lots of different celebrities.

1050
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,460
 We'll get to the list.

1051
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,140
 - Probably some of your mates.

1052
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,740
 (laughing)

1053
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:05,620
 - John Richardson's gotta have a look in naming a gorilla.

1054
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,180
 - John Keveny goes there often, doesn't he?

1055
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,020
 - Yeah.

1056
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,940
 - There are multiple characters who will come up on stage

1057
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:14,180
 and then they'll name one of the new baby gorillas

1058
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,020
 that's been born that year.

1059
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,820
 And a big picture comes up behind

1060
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:19,180
 and they say, I name this gorilla

1061
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,180
 and they give them sensible.

1062
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:22,020
 They don't call them sort of barry.

1063
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:26,300
 - Well, quite a lot of the Arsenal footballers go there

1064
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,500
 'cause Arsenal are sponsored by Rwanda.

1065
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,580
 - So they are, yeah.

1066
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,660
 So 'cause the president's a big Arsenal fan.

1067
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:32,500
 - He is, yeah.

1068
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,900
 So in 2018, Alex Scott went.

1069
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,500
 In 2019, David Louise went.

1070
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:42,500
 In 2020, Hector Bellerin and Patrick Obamiang went.

1071
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:47,820
 Obamiang named a 14-year-old gorilla Ligitego, meaning goal,

1072
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:53,560
 and Bellerin chose Mjugarriro, meaning defender.

1073
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,700
 So it's like appropriate stuff for them.

1074
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,700
 So maybe next year they'll be runner-up

1075
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:01,860
 or smashed by Paris Saint-Germain.

1076
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:02,700
 - Boom.

1077
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:07,140
 - So do these poor gorillas have to wait

1078
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:10,100
 sometimes nearly a year before they get a name?

1079
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,020
 - Yes, I suppose they do.

1080
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,420
 They probably have a holding name.

1081
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:15,140
 - They might have their own name in their own language

1082
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:17,220
 and they might not care what we call them.

1083
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,420
 - No, I doubt it.

1084
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,980
 - That's it, well, no, they couldn't.

1085
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,140
 I don't know about gorillas,

1086
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,340
 but did you know that Marma sets

1087
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:26,740
 are the only non-human primate that call each other by name?

1088
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:27,580
 - Do they?

1089
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:28,420
 - Yeah.

1090
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,340
 And they say, "Hello, Barry."

1091
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,420
 - And there's always Barry.

1092
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,260
 - Always Barry.

1093
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,100
 They all call Barry.

1094
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,140
 - It's got a point in us, really.

1095
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,780
 - Of course it may not be their name at all.

1096
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,860
 It may be just a, all right, Sam.

1097
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:38,860
 - It's just a burp.

1098
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:43,260
 Idris Elba called, they get big names.

1099
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:45,660
 Called Juan Narame, meaning long life.

1100
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:48,340
 David Attenborough's obviously named one.

1101
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,900
 But yeah, it sounds really fun.

1102
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,580
 And the idea is to protect gorillas.

1103
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,620
 And the story of protecting gorillas in Rwanda

1104
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:56,500
 is an amazing success story, isn't it?

1105
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,340
 So they-

1106
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,700
 - Diane Fossey.

1107
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:02,660
 - Diane Fossey, yes, who I'm sure we'll talk about.

1108
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,500
 It's estimated that one mountain gorilla,

1109
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,740
 and it's mountain gorillas there.

1110
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:08,540
 So there are four species and subspecies of gorilla.

1111
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:11,460
 But one mountain gorilla can generate $3 million

1112
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,900
 during its lifetime from tourism.

1113
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,180
 And that all goes back into conservation.

1114
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,500
 To protection.

1115
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,620
 To the extent, and I found this really interesting.

1116
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:20,540
 So there are, like I say,

1117
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:23,340
 four species and subspecies of gorilla.

1118
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:24,540
 There's western lowland,

1119
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:29,060
 of which there are between 150 and 300,000.

1120
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:29,900
 Remember that.

1121
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,140
 There's cross river gorillas,

1122
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,660
 of which there are about 300.

1123
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:33,500
 Mountain gorilla,

1124
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,460
 I think there are about 800 to 1,000.

1125
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:38,420
 And grower's gorilla, 6,500.

1126
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,340
 All are critically endangered,

1127
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:43,020
 except one, which is just endangered.

1128
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:43,980
 - Right.

1129
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,900
 - Now, have you memorized all the figures?

1130
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,860
 - Yeah, the lowland western gorillas, you said.

1131
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:48,700
 - There you go.

1132
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,740
 The western lowland, 150 to 300,000.

1133
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,100
 Surely they're just endangered.

1134
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,300
 No, they're critically endangered.

1135
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,420
 And the mountain gorilla from Rwanda

1136
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,780
 is the only one that's only endangered,

1137
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,700
 even though there are only 800,

1138
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:01,940
 because their numbers are going up.

1139
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:02,780
 - Because they're going up.

1140
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,300
 But that's, I think that's how they do it, right?

1141
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,620
 - No, of course it's how they do it.

1142
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:07,740
 But I think it's an extraordinary discrepancy

1143
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:11,780
 between 300,800, but only one is critically endangered.

1144
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,780
 - And it's kind of surprising that they're going up,

1145
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:16,000
 well, certainly over the last 30 years or so,

1146
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,660
 'cause they had a big old war in Rwanda.

1147
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:19,500
 - Yeah.

1148
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,500
 - And in actual facts,

1149
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:24,620
 there were 16 gorillas killed during that civil war.

1150
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,220
 But the population still--

1151
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,060
 - This is a problem now.

1152
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:29,100
 Gorillas or guerrillas?

1153
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:32,540
 - Yeah, guerrillas or guerrillas.

1154
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,220
 - I should check that actually,

1155
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,380
 that I'm not talking about guerrillas.

1156
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:38,740
 - What do you call a gorilla with a machine gun?

1157
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:39,580
 - I don't know, John.

1158
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,420
 - Sir.

1159
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:42,700
 (laughing)

1160
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,060
 - But yeah, basically the gorillas moved up

1161
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:46,980
 into the mountains away from all the humans

1162
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,060
 and all the violence.

1163
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:50,740
 And so that's why their numbers went way higher.

1164
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:52,700
 And also, none of the factions

1165
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,700
 wanted the bad publicity of killing gorillas.

1166
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,540
 - Yeah.

1167
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:56,380
 - So yeah, they--

1168
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,700
 - And that is amazing, but mostly the reason,

1169
00:41:58,700 --> 00:41:59,820
 'cause it is such a success story,

1170
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,980
 is because Rwanda's run an extraordinary

1171
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:04,260
 protection program since then,

1172
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,140
 which basically means that they--

1173
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:07,620
 - How have they stopped the poaching?

1174
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:09,100
 Is there sort of security force?

1175
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,420
 - There's just been an amazing investment

1176
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:11,260
 in local communities.

1177
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:12,460
 So a lot of the poachers,

1178
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:14,820
 'cause people, I always think poachers get a bad rep,

1179
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:16,620
 largely they're poaching for survival, right?

1180
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:17,660
 That these were people in a country

1181
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:20,100
 that were so poor, people were struggling,

1182
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,060
 and the poachers are now involved in conservation.

1183
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,100
 So there are a lot of poachers

1184
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,860
 who do various tourist things now.

1185
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:28,300
 And it's just giving them real national pride

1186
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,140
 in this thing, like this big ceremony,

1187
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,540
 which means it literally doesn't happen.

1188
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:32,980
 - Yeah, because they worked out, as you say,

1189
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:35,660
 one gorilla can bring 3 million in an entire lifetime.

1190
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:38,060
 So it's more profitable now to be a tourist guide

1191
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:40,780
 rather than to kill one and get a one-off payment.

1192
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:44,340
 Which, and so that, I mean, it has largely come down

1193
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:46,500
 from the stuff I've read to Diane Fosse.

1194
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,060
 I mean, I know she's the ambassador name,

1195
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:51,500
 but she really kind of, she moved there back in the '70s,

1196
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,540
 plopped herself on the side of the mountain,

1197
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:55,380
 when there was virtually no one doing that.

1198
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,940
 She was given a name,

1199
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:59,060
 which was the woman who lives alone in the forest

1200
00:42:59,060 --> 00:42:59,900
 by all the locals.

1201
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,220
 - Big ceremony, was it?

1202
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:03,460
 (all laughing)

1203
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:05,060
 - Natalie Potman Cableog.

1204
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:07,740
 - She had to wait a year before they thought of it.

1205
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:11,100
 - But yeah, so Diane Fosse, the reason she went out there

1206
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:14,740
 was this was off the back of a man called Lewis Leakey,

1207
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:16,060
 who we've mentioned before,

1208
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:17,540
 one of my favorite people in the world

1209
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:20,420
 of paleoanthropology, had wild theories

1210
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:22,260
 and also had a lot of discoveries

1211
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:26,540
 about ancient versions of Homo sapiens and so on.

1212
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:29,140
 - Dan, a few episodes ago, we had to fade you out

1213
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:31,100
 when you started going into this kind of thing.

1214
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:31,940
 (all laughing)

1215
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:32,980
 - Well, he thinks that the reason

1216
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:34,820
 that we became the dominant species of planet Earth

1217
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,660
 is because we were too smelly to eat,

1218
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:39,700
 as we were in the wild, he's a brilliant guy.

1219
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,300
 But he thought that the people who should go out

1220
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:44,340
 and study apes should be a single woman

1221
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:46,260
 with no scientific training.

1222
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:50,340
 He's very much the Picasso of the paleoanthropology world

1223
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:52,540
 in that he was a bit dubious with women.

1224
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:54,340
 He had a lot of researchers around him

1225
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:58,100
 who were, let's say, at his whim.

1226
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:01,580
 He was a bit of deviant, but he did amazing things.

1227
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:03,220
 - Did you say he was your favorite?

1228
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:04,060
 - Do you know what?

1229
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:04,900
 We can edit that, right?

1230
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:07,540
 (all laughing)

1231
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:08,980
 But he picked Diane Fosse.

1232
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,180
 He thought she'd be perfect.

1233
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,020
 And he said to her,

1234
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:12,620
 "The only thing that you need to have to go out there

1235
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:13,860
 is no appendix."

1236
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:16,340
 And so she took her appendix out to go.

1237
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:17,580
 - Someone else must have taken it out.

1238
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:18,700
 - Yeah, a doctor took it out.

1239
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:20,620
 And then she got a letter six weeks later from him saying,

1240
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:22,700
 by the way, I was joking about the whole appendix thing.

1241
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,180
 - No. - Yeah.

1242
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:25,020
 It was too late.

1243
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:27,140
 She already did it by then.

1244
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:28,420
 - That's a problem with deadpan humor.

1245
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:30,060
 If you don't put the emoji afterwards,

1246
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:32,060
 we wouldn't get it.

1247
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:34,260
 - She was quite controversial though, Diane Fosse, right?

1248
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:35,420
 - Absolutely.

1249
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:37,620
 - I read that once she captured,

1250
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:41,820
 or her associates captured a poacher,

1251
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:43,140
 stripped him of his clothes,

1252
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:44,780
 laid him spread eagle on the ground

1253
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:46,820
 and lashed his genitals with nettles.

1254
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,340
 - Yeah, that's how I saw it.

1255
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:49,700
 - And she thought basically the way

1256
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:52,620
 that you deal with poachers is not like Anna says,

1257
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:54,820
 improving society and giving them other ways

1258
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:55,900
 of making money.

1259
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:57,780
 You should just beat it out of them.

1260
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:58,620
 - Yeah.

1261
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:00,940
 - I mean, that to be fair is kind of the twist

1262
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:03,420
 in her story is that she arrived as a conservationist.

1263
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:04,780
 She learned so much about gorillas,

1264
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:07,140
 wrote that incredible book.

1265
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:07,980
 What's it called?

1266
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:09,820
 - Gorillas in the Mist is a movie based on her, right?

1267
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:11,500
 - Yeah, based, but that's off her book.

1268
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,380
 So she wrote a book,

1269
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:14,340
 which was a memoir of her time there.

1270
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:17,260
 And then when poachers killed a gorilla

1271
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:19,660
 that she'd really become close with,

1272
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:21,220
 they'd lobbed the gorillas head off.

1273
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:22,700
 - Digit, it was called digit.

1274
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:23,540
 - That's right.

1275
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:25,340
 There was a turning point where she goes

1276
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:28,600
 from conservationist really to poacher killer.

1277
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,140
 And she was furious.

1278
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:32,900
 And anyone who was in her way was part of the problem.

1279
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,220
 So even the anti-poaching league,

1280
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:36,220
 she thought, no, you're part of it as well.

1281
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:37,060
 And to be fair,

1282
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:38,780
 she had a horrific time in her early days there.

1283
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:40,740
 She was kidnapped by rebels.

1284
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:42,940
 She was sexually assaulted.

1285
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:45,620
 She had a lot of bad times there.

1286
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:47,820
 - Yeah, she was tough as nails, woman.

1287
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:49,980
 I mean, bad childhood tough times there.

1288
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:51,460
 Extraordinary person.

1289
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:54,020
 But then she did go a little bit,

1290
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:54,980
 well, she just went hard line,

1291
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:56,100
 didn't she, towards the end? - She did.

1292
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:57,180
 - And sort of beat up poachers,

1293
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:58,100
 which is quite hardcore.

1294
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:59,540
 And I had actually had no idea

1295
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:01,620
 that she was murdered, Diane Fossey.

1296
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:03,460
 - Yes. - And to research this, but...

1297
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:05,020
 - It's just such a wild story.

1298
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:07,660
 So Digit was decapitated by the poachers

1299
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:10,500
 and his hands cut off to make ashtrays out of.

1300
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:11,500
 - And she was horribly mad.

1301
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:12,660
 She was found dead in her cabin

1302
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:16,620
 and bizarrely blamed on a jealous fellow researcher

1303
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:19,020
 in absentia, who I don't think was ever really solved.

1304
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:21,700
 I think we assume it was angry poachers.

1305
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:22,540
 - Yeah, we still don't know.

1306
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:24,300
 There's so many theories out there.

1307
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:25,660
 And she's still there though.

1308
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:27,700
 She's buried in the gorilla cemetery.

1309
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:28,740
 - Next to Digit.

1310
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:30,940
 She's buried next to Digit, yes.

1311
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:33,620
 - Gorillas though, amazing animals.

1312
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:35,460
 - They get high by spinning in circles.

1313
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,420
 That's a new discovery recently.

1314
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:41,180
 And that was like, I really loved this bit of science.

1315
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:43,980
 Basically, there was a viral clip that went around

1316
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:46,420
 of a gorilla spinning round.

1317
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:47,860
 And they thought, oh, that looks fun.

1318
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:49,540
 Let's see if anyone else does that.

1319
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:51,260
 And then they did more research and found out

1320
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:53,180
 that yeah, they do do that.

1321
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:54,980
 - Well, if you will withhold drugs from the kids,

1322
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:56,380
 they'll find a way, won't they?

1323
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:58,940
 They make a, you know how we make a big deal

1324
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:00,180
 about lions and tigers roaring?

1325
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:03,100
 I think the gorilla roar is the most frightening.

1326
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:05,900
 So they do that and then they make the belch sound,

1327
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:08,060
 which is the other main kind of vocalization.

1328
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:11,300
 And that's a little, sort of like a little burp or a growl,

1329
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:13,340
 which says, I'm here, don't worry, I'm your friend.

1330
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:15,460
 And so if researchers are working with gorillas,

1331
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:17,460
 then they learn to make that sound straight away

1332
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:19,460
 to reassure them because you're in the jungle,

1333
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:20,940
 you don't have that good visibility.

1334
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:23,660
 So it's not as much about facial recognition.

1335
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:26,700
 Although the other thing that researchers have to do

1336
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:28,100
 is learn to memorize.

1337
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:30,420
 And this is something that I think was pioneered

1338
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:31,780
 a little bit by Diane Fossey,

1339
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:33,700
 but learn to memorize their nose prints.

1340
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:35,020
 So that after a few months,

1341
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:37,660
 you can spot one 50 yards away and immediately know.

1342
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:38,500
 - Well, that makes sense.

1343
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:39,340
 - Barry.

1344
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:40,180
 - Yeah, that's great.

1345
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:42,340
 - Is it that obvious what the prints are?

1346
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:44,340
 Or do you have to get really close?

1347
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:45,380
 'Cause like fingerprints,

1348
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:47,460
 you need to put your fingers in ink, right?

1349
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:49,100
 - It's definitely more obvious than that.

1350
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:52,900
 It's like wrinkles on a face, on quite a wrinkly face.

1351
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:54,060
 - Okay.

1352
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:56,060
 I noticed you were looking at me when you said that.

1353
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:57,860
 - I was looking past you.

1354
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:02,460
 - Do you know that when you arrive into Rwanda,

1355
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:06,300
 they go through like any airport security,

1356
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,380
 there's certain countries you can't bring fruit in and so on.

1357
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:10,860
 Do you know what you're not allowed to bring in to Rwanda?

1358
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:12,140
 - Drugs.

1359
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:13,020
 - Not drugs.

1360
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:14,860
 - Oh, you are allowed to bring drugs.

1361
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:16,260
 - No, it's just not the answer I'm looking for.

1362
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,100
 - Okay.

1363
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:19,460
 - What's the answer you're looking for?

1364
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:21,140
 - Plastic bags.

1365
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:23,500
 - If you go to the official tourism website,

1366
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,260
 that's on there saying you will be stopped

1367
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:26,620
 and you can get in serious trouble

1368
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:29,140
 if you're trying to smuggle plastic bags into the country.

1369
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:31,540
 - 12 months in prison for using plastic bags.

1370
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:32,980
 - Wow.

1371
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:33,980
 - Is it your joking?

1372
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:37,740
 - 100% and the fine of up to $540.

1373
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:41,700
 Now that law is really in place for large companies

1374
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:42,620
 who are breaking the law.

1375
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:44,860
 Like if you or I brought a plastic bag in,

1376
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:46,900
 we probably wouldn't get 12 months in prison,

1377
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:48,620
 but it is actually on the law books.

1378
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:50,300
 That is the punishment.

1379
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:51,380
 - Yeah, I remember that happening.

1380
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:52,860
 We all thought mad.

1381
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:55,180
 Imagine living without plastic bags.

1382
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:57,340
 And now we all sort of do.

1383
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:58,420
 - We don't, do we?

1384
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:00,540
 (all laughing)

1385
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:02,940
 - We just pay our 5P and suck it up.

1386
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:07,780
 - I think even though we've had all this talk of guerrillas,

1387
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:10,380
 the favorite animal in Rwanda is the cow.

1388
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:13,820
 They're obsessively into cows.

1389
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:14,860
 It's great.

1390
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:18,100
 And so there's lots of dances inspired by cows.

1391
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:19,740
 So you've got the kind of Rwandan ballet,

1392
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:21,020
 which is inspired by cows

1393
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:24,100
 where women emulate cows movements.

1394
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:27,100
 Maybe they're more graceful in Rwanda.

1395
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:28,580
 - Like what does a cow do?

1396
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:30,340
 It just stands there for ages

1397
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:32,180
 and occasionally eats a bit of grass.

1398
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:35,340
 - What I, gentle is what I read and I actually didn't watch it.

1399
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:37,180
 So gentle movements.

1400
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:39,020
 It's a bit of swaying sometimes.

1401
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:40,620
 - Swishing away a fly.

1402
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:41,460
 - Yeah.

1403
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:42,740
 - It's a tail, it's all in the tail.

1404
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:43,580
 - It's very unique.

1405
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:44,660
 - All Rwanda women have tails.

1406
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:45,500
 Did I not mention that?

1407
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:46,340
 - Oh, is that right?

1408
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:47,180
 - Yeah.

1409
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:48,460
 If you want to wish someone well,

1410
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:51,980
 you say may you have a cow or have thousands of cows.

1411
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:54,620
 - Same in America, don't have a cow man.

1412
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:55,460
 - Yeah.

1413
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:56,300
 - Okay, yeah.

1414
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,940
 - It's like Helena, cowabunga, as the turtle says.

1415
00:49:58,940 --> 00:49:59,780
 - Yep.

1416
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:00,620
 Okay.

1417
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:02,300
 There's a lot of crossover.

1418
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:03,780
 But they also love milk.

1419
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:07,100
 And instead of going to a bar in Kigali,

1420
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:07,940
 capital of Rwanda,

1421
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:10,140
 you will go to a milk bar very often.

1422
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:13,420
 And I think this is since the nineties,

1423
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:15,020
 when after the genocide,

1424
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:17,580
 there was massive urbanization

1425
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:20,020
 and crops were decimated.

1426
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:21,820
 A lot of cattle were massacred

1427
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:23,260
 and everything changed.

1428
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:25,940
 And a lot of people missed that agricultural connection.

1429
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,260
 And now they all go to milk bars.

1430
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:28,900
 - Are they alcoholic milks?

1431
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:29,740
 - No.

1432
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:30,580
 - You can get that.

1433
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:31,420
 - They are not.

1434
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:32,260
 - Are they really?

1435
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:33,100
 - So they claim.

1436
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:34,340
 It might be that they're all getting pissed,

1437
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:35,820
 but they're all claiming they're just like

1438
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:37,300
 a hot or a cold milk.

1439
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:39,580
 - There's also a thing called the Garinka program,

1440
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:41,820
 which is the idea that the government

1441
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:44,420
 will give every poor family a cow.

1442
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:45,540
 And over the years,

1443
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:48,940
 they've given over 400,000 cows to different families.

1444
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:51,740
 And the idea is that you can use them in your

1445
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:53,020
 to fertilize the land.

1446
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:55,380
 You can help drink the milk.

1447
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:56,820
 If you're not living in the city.

1448
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:57,660
 - I was thinking,

1449
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:59,340
 you're sitting there in your flat in the city,

1450
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:00,860
 third floor of your cow in your land,

1451
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:02,920
 and you go, "What the fuck are we gonna do with this?"

1452
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:05,380
 (laughing)

1453
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:07,580
 - Do you think that the naming ceremony

1454
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:09,340
 is based on a sort of human?

1455
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:11,180
 Because there are lots of those around the world, right?

1456
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:12,020
 - Yeah, it is.

1457
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:14,180
 It's big and Rwanda, giving the name,

1458
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:16,540
 the name that you give someone determines their life.

1459
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:19,260
 - They are born, they have their first cigar,

1460
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:21,620
 and then you have a big ceremony where you name them,

1461
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,580
 and all of the family members come along,

1462
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,340
 and some people suggest different names,

1463
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:27,180
 and then they decide which one they're gonna go with,

1464
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:28,700
 and there's a big old party.

1465
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:29,940
 - And it's usually Idris Elba,

1466
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:32,060
 who it comes down to the decision in the end.

1467
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:33,980
 He's a very busy man, but...

1468
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:36,220
 - But the ancient Romans had one called

1469
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:38,540
 DA's illustrious of purification day.

1470
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:41,580
 That was what the naming ceremony was called.

1471
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:43,300
 According to Plutarch,

1472
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,140
 until the baby had a name,

1473
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:46,900
 and the umbilical cord fell off,

1474
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:49,500
 they were regarded as a plant rather than an animal.

1475
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:50,340
 - Really?

1476
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:52,980
 - Yes, it was only when the umbilical cord fell off.

1477
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:54,260
 - I thought it was like a stalk?

1478
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:55,780
 - Yeah, I guess you're rooted to something.

1479
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:57,100
 - So this is the thing, I didn't know,

1480
00:51:57,100 --> 00:52:00,660
 I knew that from somewhere that ancient Roman women

1481
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:02,180
 had very small choice of names,

1482
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:04,340
 but if you were called Claudius, for example,

1483
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:06,140
 you had a daughter, she'd be called Claudia.

1484
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:08,060
 You wouldn't have her own name.

1485
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:09,940
 And if you had a second daughter,

1486
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:11,700
 she would be called Claudia Minor,

1487
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:13,740
 and the first one would be called Claudia Major.

1488
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:15,300
 If you had a third daughter,

1489
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,300
 she would just be called Claudius Tertia,

1490
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,860
 you know, Claudius III until...

1491
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:22,180
 - I think Julius Caesar had like four sisters all called Julia.

1492
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,220
 - Yes, really? - Really?

1493
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:24,060
 - Yeah.

1494
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:24,900
 - Wow.

1495
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:27,020
 In Hungary, there's a Hungarian naming day.

1496
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:28,100
 Have you heard of this?

1497
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:31,060
 So the idea is that a name is associated

1498
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:32,180
 with one day of the year,

1499
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:34,380
 and a lot of people will celebrate their name day

1500
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:35,220
 rather than actual birthday.

1501
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:36,300
 - Oh yeah, I think that happens in a few years.

1502
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:37,820
 - I think we've discussed that quite recently,

1503
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:39,500
 haven't we? - Often the same day.

1504
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:40,340
 - Oh, right.

1505
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:42,740
 - It's all like Ghana, where they name kids

1506
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:44,060
 after the day of the week.

1507
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:44,900
 - Yeah, right.

1508
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:47,380
 - So in Akan, for example, Kofi,

1509
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:50,420
 as in Kofi Annan means born on Friday.

1510
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:53,660
 And Quasi, as in Quasi Quateng means born on Sunday.

1511
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:54,500
 - Really?

1512
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:57,180
 - And Liz, as in Liz Truss, means born yesterday.

1513
00:52:57,180 --> 00:53:00,580
 - A bit of three-year-old satire there.

1514
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:03,160
 (upbeat music)

1515
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:07,660
 - Okay, that's it.

1516
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:08,580
 That is all of our facts.

1517
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:10,500
 Thank you so much for listening.

1518
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:13,820
 You can find us all on our various social media accounts.

1519
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:16,340

1520
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:17,180
 James.

1521
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:18,020
 - My Instagram is noses.

1522
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:19,060
 I think it's James Harkin.

1523
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:20,180
 - John, you're on Instagram.

1524
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:22,180
 - I'm JohnloidQI.

1525
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:23,020
 - Nice.

1526
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:24,500
 And anything you want to plug while we're here?

1527
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,940
 - Well, I really want to say my son, Harry,

1528
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:30,500
 who you all know is an amazing band called Waiting for Smith.

1529
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:33,260
 And they've got a great new single coming out called

1530
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:34,460
 I Got That Smiling For You,

1531
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:36,620
 which I think is going to be his smash thing.

1532
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:39,660
 Waiting for Smith on Instagram or all the other platforms.

1533
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:40,500
 - Nice.

1534
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:42,660

 There's bits of merch.

1543
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:00,540
 There's the gateway to Club Fish,

1544
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:02,980
 the membership club where we have bonus material

1545

 popping up every fortnight.

1546
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:05,820
 It's a really fun place.

1547
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:06,660
 Check it out.

1548
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:07,900
 Otherwise, just come back here next week

1549
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:09,660
 'cause we will be back with another episode

1550
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:10,740
 and we will see you then.

1551
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:11,780
 Good bye.

1552
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:14,360
 (upbeat music)

1553
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:17,860
 - Can you do some folio?

1554
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:19,220
 I'm just gonna walk over there.

1555
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:20,060
 - Yeah.

1556
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:24,020
 - That's offensive.

1557
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:24,860
 He's not that heavy.

1558
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:29,740
 - And I'm back.

1559
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:31,020
 I just went to the...

1560
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:33,660
 (laughing)

1561
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:35,900
 I just went to the bookcase

1562
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:37,380
 because staring me in the face

1563
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:39,300
 is this book, "The Adoles of London".

1564
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:42,220
 - And it's by John Richardson.

1565
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:43,060
 Wow.

1566
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:43,900
 - Oh my God.

1567
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:45,220
 - It's by another John Richardson.

1568
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:46,060
 - It's so good, isn't it?

1569
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:46,900
 - What a coincidence.

1570
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:47,740
 - This guy's amazing.

1571
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:48,580
 - He's a polymath.

1572
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:50,020
 - How does he get time to do the...

1573
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:52,600
 (upbeat music)

1574
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:55,180
 (upbeat music)

1575
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:57,760
 (upbeat music)

1576
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,340
 (upbeat music)
