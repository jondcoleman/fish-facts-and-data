00:00:01,00:00:04,"Hi everyone, welcome to another episode of No Such Things"
00:00:04,00:00:05,of Fish.
00:00:05,00:00:08,Andrew Hunter Murray is away on holiday
00:00:08,00:00:11,looking for rare species of moss
00:00:11,00:00:14,or perhaps covering his entire house in solar panels.
00:00:14,00:00:17,"I'm not sure what he's doing, but he's not here."
00:00:17,00:00:22,"And so in his place, we have the founder of QI, John Lloyd."
00:00:22,00:00:25,Now you'll all know John because he's been on this show
00:00:25,00:00:27,"many, many times, but if you're a new listener,"
00:00:27,00:00:31,"then he is, he's like a master of British comedy"
00:00:31,00:00:33,"over the last 40, 50 years."
00:00:33,00:00:36,"He was instrumental in things like not the nine o'clock news,"
00:00:36,00:00:40,"black-hatter, QI of course, spitting image."
00:00:40,00:00:42,"If you were a fan of that back in the day,"
00:00:42,00:00:44,there's a really nice anecdote later on in this episode
00:00:44,00:00:46,where he talks about that.
00:00:46,00:00:48,"Basically, he's an all-round genius"
00:00:48,00:00:51,and I'm sure you'll enjoy his talents on this week's show.
00:00:51,00:00:53,"I should quickly say, because I know he would want me to,"
00:00:53,00:00:58,"that his son, Harry, who is a good friend of all of us,"
00:00:58,00:01:00,he is in a band and they have a new single out.
00:01:00,00:01:02,The band is called Waiting for Smith.
00:01:02,00:01:04,"So if you're interested in that,"
00:01:04,00:01:07,then go to anywhere where you get your music
00:01:07,00:01:09,or any bit of social media search for Waiting for Smith
00:01:09,00:01:11,and you will find all about that.
00:01:11,00:01:13,"Anyway, without further ado,"
00:01:13,00:01:15,let us continue with another episode
00:01:15,00:01:19,of No Such Things as a Fish with Mr. John Lloyd
00:01:19,00:01:20,on with a podcast.
00:01:20,00:01:23,(upbeat music)
00:01:23,00:01:38,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:01:38,00:01:40,"of No Such Things as a Fish,"
00:01:40,00:01:42,a weekly podcast coming to you
00:01:42,00:01:44,from the QI offices in Hoburn.
00:01:44,00:01:45,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:01:45,00:01:48,"I am sitting here with James Harkin, Anna Tyshinski"
00:01:48,00:01:50,and John Lloyd.
00:01:50,00:01:52,"And once again, we have gathered round the microphones"
00:01:52,00:01:55,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:01:55,00:01:58,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:01:58,00:02:01,"Starting with fact number one, that is Lloydy."
00:02:01,00:02:06,- So my fact is that Picasso inhaled his first cigar
00:02:06,00:02:09,on the day he was born.
00:02:09,00:02:11,(laughing)
00:02:11,00:02:16,"So Picasso was born at home on the 25th of October, 1881."
00:02:17,00:02:18,He had a very difficult birth
00:02:18,00:02:21,and he was unusually small and undeveloped.
00:02:21,00:02:23,The midwife wrote him off as stillborn.
00:02:23,00:02:24,- Oh no. - Right.
00:02:24,00:02:26,- And literally parked him on a side table
00:02:26,00:02:28,while she looked after his mum.
00:02:28,00:02:29,- Right.
00:02:29,00:02:32,"- And it was fortunate because Picasso's uncle,"
00:02:32,00:02:36,"his father's brother, Salvador Ruiz Blasco,"
00:02:36,00:02:38,"who was also a doctor, happened to be there."
00:02:38,00:02:41,And he was smoking a cigar as you do in those doors.
00:02:41,00:02:42,"- Of course, yep."
00:02:42,00:02:45,- And he strode over and puffed a great waft of smoke
00:02:45,00:02:47,"into Picasso's face and the baby went,"
00:02:47,00:02:48,(screaming)
00:02:48,00:02:50,- Oh really? - In a horrible face.
00:02:50,00:02:51,- Okay.
00:02:51,00:02:53,- And then he lasered a huge yell and saved his life.
00:02:53,00:02:53,- Wow. - Okay.
00:02:53,00:02:55,- So he didn't enjoy his first smoke.
00:02:55,00:02:57,"Like many of us, it sounds like"
00:02:57,00:02:59,he didn't embrace it first time round.
00:02:59,00:03:01,"- Well, he came round quickly"
00:03:01,00:03:03,'cause he was a lifelong smoker.
00:03:03,00:03:06,"In fact, he smoked until seven years before his death,"
00:03:06,00:03:10,"age 91, but tellingly, he never inhaled."
00:03:10,00:03:10,- Is that right?
00:03:10,00:03:11,- So there you are.
00:03:11,00:03:12,- The Bill Clinton.
00:03:12,00:03:13,- Yeah.
00:03:13,00:03:15,(laughing)
00:03:15,00:03:19,"- Yeah, he died in 1973."
00:03:19,00:03:20,- Yeah.
00:03:20,00:03:22,"- Which I worked out meant that he could, in theory,"
00:03:22,00:03:26,"have met Pharrell Williams, the pop star."
00:03:26,00:03:27,- Okay.
00:03:27,00:03:28,- And do you think they would have got along?
00:03:28,00:03:30,"- Well, Pharrell was only three days old"
00:03:30,00:03:32,"when Picasso died and for all that time,"
00:03:32,00:03:35,Pharrell was in Virginia and Picasso was in France.
00:03:35,00:03:35,So at least one of them
00:03:35,00:03:37,would have had to make quite a lengthy trip.
00:03:37,00:03:38,- Yes.
00:03:38,00:03:39,- Or a Zoom call.
00:03:39,00:03:41,"- A Zoom call, yeah."
00:03:41,00:03:44,- What are you thinking we're missing out on
00:03:44,00:03:45,by them not meeting?
00:03:45,00:03:46,Why them two specifically?
00:03:46,00:03:47,"- Well, I just think Pharrell"
00:03:47,00:03:50,"is a very, very modern day name, right?"
00:03:50,00:03:50,"- Yes, right."
00:03:50,00:03:52,"- And Picasso, for anyone who was born"
00:03:52,00:03:54,"after he died, like myself,"
00:03:54,00:03:56,he feels like someone in the past.
00:03:56,00:03:57,Do you know what I mean?
00:03:57,00:03:58,So I think it's quite surprising
00:03:58,00:03:59,"that those two could, in theory, have met."
00:03:59,00:04:02,"- And, of course, Virginia, the home of tobacco,"
00:04:02,00:04:03,Virginia ready-rubbed and so on.
00:04:03,00:04:04,- What a good point.
00:04:04,00:04:05,- It would have got on really well.
00:04:05,00:04:06,- Yes.
00:04:06,00:04:09,(laughing)
00:04:09,00:04:12,"He was baptized Pablo Diego, Jose Francisco de Palo,"
00:04:12,00:04:17,"Juan Nepum Maceno, Crispiniano Maria de los Remedios,"
00:04:17,00:04:22,de la Santissima Trinidad Rui Picasso.
00:04:22,00:04:26,"- Actually not, because the priest made--"
00:04:26,00:04:27,"- Well, you could have said that before I started."
00:04:27,00:04:29,(laughing)
00:04:29,00:04:30,- The priest made a spelling mistake.
00:04:30,00:04:31,"- Oh, did he?"
00:04:31,00:04:33,"- He was supposed to be called Crispiniano,"
00:04:33,00:04:36,"because St. Crispin's Day, the 25th of October,"
00:04:36,00:04:37,was the day he was born.
00:04:37,00:04:39,And the priest made a spelling mistake
00:04:39,00:04:40,and called him Chipriano.
00:04:40,00:04:42,"- Chipriano, which is a brand of crisps."
00:04:42,00:04:45,(laughing)
00:04:45,00:04:48,"- His first word, there's a legend behind that,"
00:04:48,00:04:51,"that his mother says, which is that it was pencil."
00:04:51,00:04:55,"So he seems like a child of destiny, in a way."
00:04:55,00:04:58,"Yeah, I'm not allowed to do the accent"
00:04:58,00:04:59,"on the show anymore, John,"
00:04:59,00:05:01,so I might as well pronounce the English versions.
00:05:01,00:05:04,- Is that like for penis in Spanish as well?
00:05:04,00:05:05,I think it might be.
00:05:05,00:05:06,- Is it?
00:05:06,00:05:09,"- Well, pencil means little penis, doesn't it, penicillus?"
00:05:09,00:05:12,"- Yeah, we'll never know which he was referring to"
00:05:12,00:05:13,at the age of one and a half.
00:05:13,00:05:15,"- They both could have been quite prescient, couldn't they?"
00:05:15,00:05:18,"- They were sort of his two leading tools, I would say."
00:05:18,00:05:21,(laughing)
00:05:21,00:05:23,"We should say, for anyone who's already switched off,"
00:05:23,00:05:25,"'cause we're talking about Picasso,"
00:05:25,00:05:27,"his reputation has taken a bit of a dive,"
00:05:27,00:05:28,"hasn't it, the last 10 years?"
00:05:28,00:05:30,I hadn't quite realized how much his mistresses
00:05:30,00:05:32,were in basically all of his art.
00:05:32,00:05:36,So it was sort of all about his sex life and his shagging.
00:05:36,00:05:38,And a lot of people do criticize the way
00:05:38,00:05:41,"that he exploited women and, you know,"
00:05:41,00:05:45,people say women were tools to be exploited for his art.
00:05:45,00:05:47,"And he did once say, every time I change wives,"
00:05:47,00:05:50,"I should burn the last one so that, you know,"
00:05:50,00:05:50,you can wipe the slate clean.
00:05:50,00:05:52,- The last wife or the last painting?
00:05:52,00:05:53,- The last wife.
00:05:53,00:05:54,- The last wife.
00:05:54,00:05:54,"- Oh, okay."
00:05:54,00:05:56,"And he only actually married twice,"
00:05:56,00:05:59,but I think he's referring to all his mistresses then.
00:05:59,00:06:02,"- Two types of women, he said, goddesses and doormats."
00:06:02,00:06:03,Yeah.
00:06:03,00:06:06,"- One of his early lovers, Francoise Chilot,"
00:06:06,00:06:08,"is part of one of my favorite facts,"
00:06:08,00:06:11,"which is that she later married Jonah Salk,"
00:06:11,00:06:13,who developed the polio jab.
00:06:13,00:06:14,"- Oh, that's a good fact."
00:06:14,00:06:14,- Yeah.
00:06:14,00:06:17,"- So she was basically Picasso's muse,"
00:06:17,00:06:20,and then she married this guy who saved the world
00:06:20,00:06:21,"a little bit really,"
00:06:21,00:06:24,'cause so many people were dying of polio in those days.
00:06:24,00:06:27,But people asked her later why she was attracted
00:06:27,00:06:29,to such outstanding men.
00:06:29,00:06:30,"And she replied,"
00:06:30,00:06:32,"""I think I am just as interesting as they."
00:06:32,00:06:36,"""Lions mate with lions, they don't mate with mice."""
00:06:36,00:06:37,- That's very good.
00:06:37,00:06:39,- But wasn't she the only muse who left him?
00:06:39,00:06:42,"- Yes, she was immune to his charms."
00:06:42,00:06:43,"She's such a,"
00:06:43,00:06:45,she's a nice person to read about
00:06:45,00:06:47,after I suppose all these women who ended up
00:06:47,00:06:49,according to some accounts destroyed.
00:06:49,00:06:52,"She just said, ""He didn't know me very well at all."
00:06:52,00:06:55,"""I'm very secretive, I smile politely, but I don't agree."
00:06:55,00:06:57,"""And I didn't invest my narcissism"
00:06:57,00:06:59,"""in being represented by him."
00:06:59,00:07:00,"""I couldn't care less."""
00:07:00,00:07:01,- Yeah.
00:07:01,00:07:02,- And walked off.
00:07:02,00:07:03,"- She wrote a book about him, a very famous book,"
00:07:03,00:07:03,"""Life with Picasso."""
00:07:03,00:07:06,"I actually read it when I was like 15 years old,"
00:07:06,00:07:08,"I saw it in a library, it's an amazing book."
00:07:08,00:07:10,And it basically caused a lot of problems
00:07:10,00:07:11,"when it came out,"
00:07:11,00:07:13,because no one wanted to know this side about Picasso.
00:07:13,00:07:14,"When it was released,"
00:07:14,00:07:16,there were 40 intellectuals who signed a petition
00:07:16,00:07:18,to have it banned and scrapped and pulped.
00:07:18,00:07:20,- But were there intellectuals?
00:07:20,00:07:20,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:07:20,00:07:21,- They thought his reputation will--
00:07:21,00:07:24,"- Yeah, including one of the major biographers"
00:07:24,00:07:26,"who wrote numerous volumes on Picasso's life afterwards,"
00:07:26,00:07:29,saying that this should be in like a tabloid
00:07:29,00:07:30,as opposed to a book shop.
00:07:30,00:07:31,- Is that John Richardson?
00:07:31,00:07:32,"- Yeah, John Richardson."
00:07:32,00:07:34,- From A.R.10 Cats and Scatham.
00:07:34,00:07:38,"- Yeah, he was fuming, he was furious."
00:07:38,00:07:40,"But interestingly, she was asked about this"
00:07:40,00:07:42,in her 90s about this biography.
00:07:42,00:07:43,"And she said, ""All these men who wrote that"
00:07:43,00:07:45,"had never met me, didn't know what I was talking about."""
00:07:45,00:07:48,"And she and John Richardson became really good friends,"
00:07:48,00:07:49,despite him slagging it off.
00:07:49,00:07:50,- How interesting.
00:07:50,00:07:53,"- Yeah, and you will see her on ""Capture Countdown."""
00:07:53,00:07:55,- When Rachel Riley's off of a tourniquet.
00:07:55,00:07:56,- Yeah.
00:07:56,00:07:56,- Yeah.
00:07:56,00:07:59,"And yeah, Richardson argued that his art"
00:07:59,00:08:04,was almost parodying the mitchismo of Andalusian males
00:08:04,00:08:07,rather than him actually being like that.
00:08:07,00:08:09,Which I don't believe.
00:08:09,00:08:10,"- Yes, very."
00:08:10,00:08:11,- It's a really interesting thing.
00:08:11,00:08:13,"I always believe that when you're at work,"
00:08:13,00:08:16,"if you're going to do it well, you mustn't have an ego."
00:08:16,00:08:18,"And I used to say for years and years,"
00:08:18,00:08:21,Picasso famously didn't behave terribly well
00:08:21,00:08:22,in all sorts of ways.
00:08:22,00:08:26,"But I'm guessing that when he went in front of the easel,"
00:08:26,00:08:28,that all went away.
00:08:28,00:08:31,"And years later, I found this wonderful quote saying,"
00:08:31,00:08:33,"""When I enter my studio,"
00:08:33,00:08:35,"""I leave my personality outside the door"
00:08:35,00:08:39,"""as a Muslim leaves his slippers outside the mosque."""
00:08:39,00:08:42,"- He did spend a lot of time at the easel though, didn't he?"
00:08:42,00:08:44,"Like, it's hard to find the exact number of works"
00:08:44,00:08:45,"that he did, but it was a lot."
00:08:45,00:08:46,- It's insane.
00:08:46,00:08:49,"- 147,800, but that's not exact."
00:08:49,00:08:51,It's...
00:08:51,00:08:54,- That's according to the official website.
00:08:54,00:08:55,"Yeah, they've done counting up and they,"
00:08:55,00:08:58,"and we've lost a lot of it because in his early days,"
00:08:58,00:09:01,he used to burn his bits of art to keep his fire going.
00:09:01,00:09:03,"- Yeah, along with his wives."
00:09:03,00:09:05,"Yeah, they taught them all on the boom fire."
00:09:05,00:09:07,- I worked out that that's one work of art
00:09:07,00:09:10,"for every five hours, 25 minutes of his life."
00:09:10,00:09:13,If he started as a baby and carried on going
00:09:13,00:09:15,until he met Pharrell that time.
00:09:15,00:09:16,"- Which once you've had your first smoke,"
00:09:16,00:09:18,you might as well end up with a paintbrush.
00:09:18,00:09:22,"He also was responsible for a major art theft,"
00:09:22,00:09:24,which I hadn't realized because we'd mentioned before
00:09:24,00:09:27,on the show that he was accused of stealing the Mona Lisa.
00:09:27,00:09:28,"- He was interviewed by the police, right?"
00:09:28,00:09:29,- Yes. - He was.
00:09:29,00:09:30,- Yes.
00:09:30,00:09:31,"- Because a pollinair, his friend,"
00:09:31,00:09:33,shopped him to the police.
00:09:33,00:09:34,- Yes.
00:09:34,00:09:35,- And Picasso then went to court and denied
00:09:35,00:09:38,"he'd ever met him, even though he's one of his best friends."
00:09:38,00:09:39,- It's serious.
00:09:39,00:09:41,"- It's quite a low moment, isn't it?"
00:09:41,00:09:43,"In their friendship, in their moral lives."
00:09:43,00:09:46,- That's probably the best indication of the power
00:09:46,00:09:48,that Picasso had that he thought he could jedi his way
00:09:48,00:09:49,"through, like..."
00:09:49,00:09:51,"- The thing was, when he described the person"
00:09:51,00:09:53,"who actually stole it, the police did a sketch"
00:09:53,00:09:55,and the noses on this side of his face
00:09:55,00:09:58,and the eyebrows on this side.
00:09:58,00:09:59,"- But there's more to it, isn't there?"
00:09:59,00:10:01,"- Well, there is more to it, yes, because..."
00:10:01,00:10:04,"So that was 1911, but actually in 1907,"
00:10:04,00:10:06,there were these two Iberian statues
00:10:06,00:10:07,stolen from the Louvre.
00:10:07,00:10:09,And I think there's just been a book written
00:10:09,00:10:11,"which puts all the pieces together,"
00:10:11,00:10:14,"but Picasso had first spotted them in about 1904,"
00:10:14,00:10:16,"fallen in love with them, told all his mates,"
00:10:16,00:10:17,love these statues.
00:10:17,00:10:19,They were put in storage.
00:10:19,00:10:20,Then they disappeared.
00:10:20,00:10:24,Turned out they'd been stolen by this chap called Pierre.
00:10:24,00:10:27,And he was mates with Picasso and the dodgy Apollinaire.
00:10:27,00:10:29,"- He was Apollinaire's secretary, I think."
00:10:29,00:10:30,"- He was Apollinaire's secretary, yes."
00:10:30,00:10:32,"But it turned, basically,"
00:10:32,00:10:35,"Picasso's lover at the time, Fernanda Olivier,"
00:10:35,00:10:38,said that he had all lots of artworks around his house.
00:10:38,00:10:41,And then he had these two statue heads
00:10:41,00:10:43,under some clothes in his wardrobe.
00:10:43,00:10:44,"And she asked him about them once and he said,"
00:10:44,00:10:47,"""Oh, we shouldn't display them anywhere too prominent."""
00:10:47,00:10:50,And it turned out to be these two stolen statues
00:10:50,00:10:52,from the Louvre.
00:10:52,00:10:55,- But we assume that Pierre had given them to Picasso.
00:10:55,00:10:57,Maybe Picasso had asked him to steal them.
00:10:57,00:10:59,Some people say that Pierre couldn't have carried them
00:10:59,00:11:02,"both out under his coat, which is what he claimed."
00:11:02,00:11:03,So maybe Picasso was there.
00:11:03,00:11:05,- It's a lot easier to steal stuff
00:11:05,00:11:06,"from the Louvre in those days, wasn't it?"
00:11:06,00:11:07,"- I was a piece of this, yeah."
00:11:07,00:11:10,"- Yeah, the lousy security, didn't they?"
00:11:10,00:11:12,"- Yeah, I think there was a story"
00:11:12,00:11:13,"that Pierre once once said to his girlfriend,"
00:11:13,00:11:15,"""I'm going to the Louvre today."
00:11:15,00:11:16,"Do you want me to pick anything else for you?"""
00:11:16,00:11:18,(laughing)
00:11:18,00:11:22,"And then ironically, Picasso is the most stolen artist"
00:11:22,00:11:23,in history now.
00:11:23,00:11:26,"But I think it's largely 'cause he made so much, right?"
00:11:26,00:11:28,"- You can't help stealing one, you pick up a sketch."
00:11:28,00:11:29,"- Yeah, and following the secretary"
00:11:29,00:11:32,"had something to do with it, I'm sure."
00:11:32,00:11:34,Shifting his stuff back to...
00:11:34,00:11:37,"- So even when he was in his 70s and 80s,"
00:11:37,00:11:40,"he was quite a womanizer, Picasso."
00:11:40,00:11:43,"And whenever anyone came to his house who he fancied,"
00:11:43,00:11:47,he would make a little sculpture of a little man
00:11:47,00:11:50,with an enormous phallus and then give it to them
00:11:50,00:11:52,as like a love gift.
00:11:52,00:11:53,- Right.
00:11:53,00:11:56,- Did that work a high percentage of the time?
00:11:56,00:11:59,- It didn't work so often because he quite often
00:11:59,00:12:01,did it in front of his wife.
00:12:01,00:12:05,And anyone who'd been given this phallic item
00:12:05,00:12:07,was not allowed back in the house.
00:12:07,00:12:09,"'Cause his wife would just be like,"
00:12:09,00:12:10,"""Well, you're obviously not coming back."""
00:12:10,00:12:11,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:12:11,00:12:14,"- And again, this is going to John Richardson."
00:12:14,00:12:14,- John Richardson.
00:12:14,00:12:18,"- To say, given all these sort of anecdotal things"
00:12:18,00:12:22,and the naughtiness that he was an extraordinary painter
00:12:22,00:12:25,and those two statues he mentioned inspired him
00:12:25,00:12:27,for Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.
00:12:27,00:12:29,"- Yeah, which is a great painting."
00:12:29,00:12:31,"- Is described by John Golding, the art critic,"
00:12:31,00:12:33,as the greatest painting of the 20th century.
00:12:33,00:12:34,It's so influential.
00:12:34,00:12:36,"- It's kind of cool for him to take,"
00:12:36,00:12:38,"like looking back at it now,"
00:12:38,00:12:40,"if the ends justify the means,"
00:12:40,00:12:41,it's fine that he stole those things
00:12:41,00:12:43,if they inspired those great works.
00:12:43,00:12:44,"- Yeah, and no one gave us just about"
00:12:44,00:12:46,two random Iberian statues
00:12:46,00:12:48,from 2000 years ago in storage.
00:12:48,00:12:50,- Remind me to not have James as my lawyer.
00:12:50,00:12:54,We were going to do a fact about them
00:12:54,00:12:56,in the podcast the next week.
00:12:56,00:12:59,- He used to make some of his paints as well.
00:12:59,00:13:01,"There's a particular brown that he made,"
00:13:01,00:13:04,which we only now know what the secret source was.
00:13:04,00:13:05,- HP.
00:13:05,00:13:10,"- No, not quite."
00:13:10,00:13:14,- It was his three-year-old daughter's poo.
00:13:14,00:13:16,"- Oh, come on, Dan, no."
00:13:16,00:13:19,"- Poocasso, they called the article."
00:13:19,00:13:23,"Yeah, he used to say that the best feces as well"
00:13:23,00:13:26,would be from a mother who the infant was being breastfed.
00:13:26,00:13:27,"- Well, I would say that like,"
00:13:27,00:13:30,"this is a three-year-old child, right?"
00:13:30,00:13:33,But definitely the poo of a much younger baby
00:13:33,00:13:35,is a color that you can't really see anywhere else
00:13:35,00:13:37,"in the world. - Oh, true, yes."
00:13:37,00:13:39,- I never see the felt tip the same color
00:13:39,00:13:41,as a nappy from a two-month-old.
00:13:41,00:13:44,"- Well, you've seen my tie, though, it's very similar."
00:13:44,00:13:50,"- Listeners, John is wearing a tie,"
00:13:50,00:13:52,which is like 50 shades of feces.
00:13:52,00:13:59,"- But nice, orangey baby feces, the harmless kind."
00:13:59,00:14:01,"- He also, I mean, we're talking about his paintings,"
00:14:01,00:14:03,but he predicted in his own lifetime
00:14:03,00:14:06,that he would be more known for his poetry than his paintings.
00:14:06,00:14:08,"- Poocasso. - Yeah, after his death."
00:14:08,00:14:11,"He wrote over 300 poems,"
00:14:11,00:14:13,and he also wrote two surrealist plays.
00:14:13,00:14:16,"- He can't really have believed,"
00:14:16,00:14:18,'cause he was incredibly famous for his paintings
00:14:18,00:14:19,throughout his life.
00:14:19,00:14:21,"And no one was going, ""Do you know what, Poocasso?"
00:14:21,00:14:22,"""People should make more of your poems."
00:14:22,00:14:23,"""Did he really think?"" - Well, he just,"
00:14:23,00:14:25,he probably thought they'll forget about it one day
00:14:25,00:14:26,and my poems will live on after me.
00:14:26,00:14:29,"- I think this is a common theme with artists, though."
00:14:29,00:14:31,"You know, rock bands who always pick the wrong songs"
00:14:31,00:14:34,gonna be successful and hate the one that's famous.
00:14:34,00:14:36,"- Yeah, John Richardson, as always,"
00:14:36,00:14:37,"they're asking him in interviews about,"
00:14:37,00:14:39,"""Hey, I've done cuts to this countdown."""
00:14:39,00:14:40,"And they never ask him about his Poocasso,"
00:14:40,00:14:43,but at first they don't.
00:14:43,00:14:45,"- But like that author, Karen Doyle, quote,"
00:14:45,00:14:47,"""You must have touched before that if in 100 years"
00:14:47,00:14:49,"""I'm remembered just for Sherlock Holmes,"
00:14:49,00:14:51,"""I would have considered my life a failure."""
00:14:51,00:14:55,"- Yeah, sorry, mate, embrace it."
00:14:55,00:15:04,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James."
00:15:04,00:15:05,"- Okay, my fact this week"
00:15:05,00:15:08,is that the national song of St. Helena
00:15:08,00:15:10,was written by a man who had never been there.
00:15:10,00:15:14,He based his lyrics on a postcard that he had seen.
00:15:14,00:15:15,- Incredible.
00:15:15,00:15:16,Let's hear it.
00:15:16,00:15:19,"- ♪ God save our great, no ♪"
00:15:19,00:15:20,That is the national anthem of St. Helena
00:15:20,00:15:23,because it's a British territory.
00:15:23,00:15:26,- So did he base it on the stamp of the postcard?
00:15:26,00:15:30,"- He wrote another anthem called ""My St. Helena Island"""
00:15:30,00:15:32,and is kind of the de facto anthem.
00:15:32,00:15:34,"It's not the official national anthem,"
00:15:34,00:15:36,"but it's the one that all saints, as they're known as,"
00:15:36,00:15:38,in St. Helena would sing.
00:15:38,00:15:40,And it was written by an American
00:15:40,00:15:42,who is better known for his appearances
00:15:42,00:15:44,on the eight out of 10 cats does countdown
00:15:44,00:15:46,called David Mitchell.
00:15:46,00:15:50,- It's stunning.
00:15:50,00:15:53,"- David Mitchell, he was nicknamed Old Saddle Bags"
00:15:53,00:15:55,"and he was a DJ on a sentient island,"
00:15:55,00:15:58,"which is, I was gonna say nearby, it's not nearby,"
00:15:58,00:16:01,"but it's the nearest place to St. Helena,"
00:16:01,00:16:03,St. Helena's in the middle of the ocean.
00:16:03,00:16:06,He became friends with some people from St. Helena
00:16:06,00:16:08,and they suggested that he writes a song for them.
00:16:08,00:16:10,And he was a bit reluctant to do that
00:16:10,00:16:11,"'cause he's never been there,"
00:16:11,00:16:15,but they sent him some postcards and he wrote this song.
00:16:15,00:16:16,And that's what happened.
00:16:16,00:16:17,"It goes, ""My heart is drifting southwards"
00:16:17,00:16:19,"""to my home down in the sea,"
00:16:19,00:16:21,"""to the Isle of St. Helena,"
00:16:21,00:16:23,"""where my loved ones wait for me."
00:16:23,00:16:24,"""We're having a lovely time,"
00:16:24,00:16:27,"""whether it's changeable, food is awful, wish you were here."""
00:16:27,00:16:29,(laughing)
00:16:29,00:16:30,- That's great.
00:16:30,00:16:31,- Genius.
00:16:31,00:16:31,- It's really good.
00:16:31,00:16:33,"And he recorded them officially, the songs,"
00:16:33,00:16:34,and they made records of it.
00:16:34,00:16:36,And he sent a bunch of records
00:16:36,00:16:38,"and pictures of himself to St. Helena as part of like,"
00:16:38,00:16:40,"""Here's the merch that you can have."""
00:16:40,00:16:42,"But he's not really known anywhere,"
00:16:42,00:16:45,"even in his hometown, in Memphis."
00:16:45,00:16:47,"But yeah, he's someone who's still around."
00:16:47,00:16:49,"I mean, it's not that long ago, right?"
00:16:49,00:16:49,So--
00:16:49,00:16:51,"- I think he's dead, isn't he?"
00:16:51,00:16:52,"- Oh, okay, the site, I saw."
00:16:52,00:16:55,"- I think his family, he's recently dead, I think."
00:16:55,00:16:55,"- Right, okay."
00:16:55,00:16:57,"- But I might be wrong about that, so I'll check."
00:16:57,00:16:59,"- But nobody's blown sick arse smoke in his face yet,"
00:16:59,00:17:00,so you can't tell.
00:17:00,00:17:02,(laughing)
00:17:02,00:17:04,"- It's interesting in postcards,"
00:17:04,00:17:08,because both Matisse and Picasso used postcards
00:17:08,00:17:10,to inspire some of their greatest work.
00:17:10,00:17:11,- Did they?
00:17:11,00:17:13,"- So Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, for example,"
00:17:13,00:17:16,"was based on a postcard that Picasso found, yeah."
00:17:16,00:17:17,- Was it?
00:17:17,00:17:18,I did not know that last night.
00:17:18,00:17:20,- And did you know that it's not the only
00:17:20,00:17:22,"national anthem or national song,"
00:17:22,00:17:24,'cause it's not strictly the national anthem
00:17:24,00:17:26,that was written by somebody who'd never been there?
00:17:26,00:17:27,Did you know that?
00:17:27,00:17:30,Guinea Bissau on the West Coast of Africa.
00:17:30,00:17:34,"The music was written by a Chinese guy called Xiao Hei,"
00:17:34,00:17:38,because the words were written by a separatist leader
00:17:38,00:17:41,"of the African party called Amal Khakabral,"
00:17:41,00:17:43,who was the leader of the African party
00:17:43,00:17:46,for the independence of Guinea Bissau and Cape Verde.
00:17:46,00:17:47,- Wow.
00:17:47,00:17:49,"- And in 1963, he went on a delegation to China"
00:17:49,00:17:52,"and they met this guy, Xiao Hei,"
00:17:52,00:17:54,and asked him to write the music.
00:17:54,00:17:55,- Really?
00:17:55,00:17:57,"- Yeah, literally last year in 2024,"
00:17:57,00:17:59,Xi Jinping held a welcome ceremony
00:17:59,00:18:03,"for the current president of Guinea Bissau,"
00:18:03,00:18:05,"who's a guy called Imaro Sosoko Mbalo,"
00:18:05,00:18:08,and they played the anthem.
00:18:08,00:18:10,This is our well-beloved motherland.
00:18:10,00:18:11,- It feels like it's got an edge to it
00:18:11,00:18:13,when you're being hosted by Xi Jinping
00:18:13,00:18:15,as the president of Tiny Guinea Bissau.
00:18:15,00:18:16,"And he's saying, here's your national anthem,"
00:18:16,00:18:19,"we wrote it, by the way, don't forget it."
00:18:19,00:18:23,"- Well, if anyone doesn't know where Saint Helena is,"
00:18:23,00:18:27,"basically from Guinea Bissau, head west,"
00:18:27,00:18:29,"and it's pretty much the first place you get to,"
00:18:29,00:18:31,is like a tiny island in the middle of the Atlantic.
00:18:31,00:18:34,- It's so isolated when you look on a map.
00:18:34,00:18:36,"If you go on your Google Maps or whatever on your phone,"
00:18:36,00:18:38,it is insanely isolated.
00:18:38,00:18:40,"- We cannot find a way of getting there,"
00:18:40,00:18:43,we'll get a lot when you try a direction.
00:18:43,00:18:44,"- Exactly, and there's a lot of,"
00:18:44,00:18:46,"I watched a few tourist videos for it,"
00:18:46,00:18:49,"where they said, you can achieve all you need to see"
00:18:49,00:18:51,"in a single day, but why not stay for three?"
00:18:51,00:18:54,It's just such a...
00:18:54,00:18:55,"- Well, 'cause that's when the next boat leaves."
00:18:55,00:18:56,"- Yeah, possibly, right, yeah."
00:18:56,00:18:59,"- I should just say thanks to my sister-in-law's best friend,"
00:18:59,00:19:01,"who gave me a lot of information about Saint Helena,"
00:19:01,00:19:02,'cause she lives there.
00:19:02,00:19:07,The national dish of Saint Helena is tomato paste sandwiches.
00:19:07,00:19:09,They're called bread and dance.
00:19:09,00:19:12,"And the idea is that if you're at a wedding,"
00:19:12,00:19:15,"there'll be a big sort of table with a load of goodies on,"
00:19:15,00:19:16,"and everyone will dance around it,"
00:19:16,00:19:18,"and then you'll eat something from the table,"
00:19:18,00:19:20,and it's usually some bread and stuff.
00:19:20,00:19:23,"- Dipton, tomato tapenade. - Yeah, pretty much."
00:19:23,00:19:26,Because it's really hard to get a hold of fresh stuff there.
00:19:26,00:19:28,"Basically once a month, you get a boat that comes in"
00:19:28,00:19:30,"with fresh fruit and vegetables,"
00:19:30,00:19:31,and everyone legs it to the shop.
00:19:31,00:19:35,"Six pack of watsits, which is £2 at Poundland,"
00:19:35,00:19:38,"in the UK, is £4 on Saint Helena,"
00:19:38,00:19:41,and a box of corn flakes that's £2.85 in the UK
00:19:41,00:19:43,is £7 in Saint Helena.
00:19:43,00:19:45,"- But there's not that much else to spend your money on,"
00:19:45,00:19:47,"so you're not complaining, are you?"
00:19:47,00:19:48,"- No, there's not a lot going on."
00:19:48,00:19:50,"But two very famous residents,"
00:19:50,00:19:53,"as most people, if they think of Saint Helena,"
00:19:53,00:19:57,Napoleon being exiled there after Waterloo in 1815.
00:19:57,00:19:59,"And the other famous resident, you know who that is?"
00:19:59,00:20:01,- No. - Jonathan the Giant Tortoise.
00:20:01,00:20:04,"- Oh, yeah. - Who lives in the grounds"
00:20:04,00:20:07,"of the governor's official residence, and he's 192."
00:20:07,00:20:09,- Jonathan's still alive. - Yeah.
00:20:09,00:20:11,- Still going pretty amazing. - Yeah.
00:20:11,00:20:13,- Was five when Queen Victoria was crowned.
00:20:13,00:20:15,"- Probably he's died quite a few times,"
00:20:15,00:20:18,and they've just replaced him with another tortoise.
00:20:18,00:20:20,"- No, no. - Like SEO trot."
00:20:20,00:20:21,- Yeah. - He's not.
00:20:21,00:20:24,"He's terribly well, if I've got a quote about him."
00:20:24,00:20:25,- From him? - Yeah.
00:20:25,00:20:26,"No, it's from his vet."
00:20:26,00:20:28,"- He said, ""Cowabunga, dude."""
00:20:28,00:20:30,- It's from his vet.
00:20:30,00:20:33,"Jonathan is now blind, but he still has a tremendous libido."
00:20:33,00:20:37,"- No, so that's your Picasso note."
00:20:37,00:20:39,"- Oh, yeah, no, sorry."
00:20:39,00:20:42,"- Kind of started off with the East India Company,"
00:20:42,00:20:47,"who were doing lots of trade with the East and with Europe,"
00:20:47,00:20:50,"and they needed somewhere to stop on the way,"
00:20:50,00:20:51,"'cause there's no Suez Canal in those days,"
00:20:51,00:20:53,"so you go all the way around Africa,"
00:20:53,00:20:56,"and they would always call it St Helena on the way,"
00:20:56,00:21:00,"and eventually they decided to put a colony down there,"
00:21:00,00:21:03,and the first laws included God was to be worshipped
00:21:03,00:21:05,"and served diligently,"
00:21:05,00:21:07,and semen were not allowed to stay on the island
00:21:07,00:21:09,without permission.
00:21:09,00:21:10,"- Oh, really?"
00:21:10,00:21:11,"- If you were caught harboring a sailor,"
00:21:11,00:21:13,you'd be fined five pounds.
00:21:13,00:21:14,- What's wrong with sailors?
00:21:14,00:21:16,"Should be inviting people, I would have thought."
00:21:16,00:21:17,"- Yeah, I think they just didn't want anyone"
00:21:17,00:21:19,coming on the island who wasn't supposed to be there.
00:21:19,00:21:20,- Okay. - Right?
00:21:20,00:21:23,- Given it was only sailors who were going by.
00:21:23,00:21:25,"- Yeah, yeah, who else are you gonna get, swimmers?"
00:21:25,00:21:26,- Yeah.
00:21:26,00:21:28,"- Do you know what the postcode is, on St Helena?"
00:21:28,00:21:30,"- No, that's good, what?"
00:21:30,00:21:33,"- Well, it's STHL1ZZ, the point being,"
00:21:33,00:21:35,"it's a Royal Mail postcode,"
00:21:35,00:21:37,"and it had its own postcode, I think,"
00:21:37,00:21:42,"but apparently people kept writing to St Helena,"
00:21:42,00:21:45,"and Mail kept going to St Helens in Merseyside,"
00:21:45,00:21:49,which is quite actually quite a long way to go from there.
00:21:49,00:21:50,- That's brilliant.
00:21:50,00:21:51,- Hard to know what to do with that mail
00:21:51,00:21:52,"when it drops through your doorstep,"
00:21:52,00:21:54,so they go from a Royal Mail postcode.
00:21:54,00:21:56,- 'Cause that was the only way you could really get there
00:21:56,00:22:00,"for a very long time, which was the RMS St Helena,"
00:22:00,00:22:02,and it was the Royal Mail ship
00:22:02,00:22:03,"that would bring all the post over,"
00:22:03,00:22:06,so you would sort of jump onto that in order to get over.
00:22:06,00:22:07,- And someone tried to post themselves
00:22:07,00:22:09,"out of St Helena, actually, didn't they?"
00:22:09,00:22:10,- Did they?
00:22:10,00:22:13,"- Yes, so another thing that was useful by the Brits"
00:22:13,00:22:15,"was in the Boar War, 1900 to 1902,"
00:22:15,00:22:20,"they sent 6,000 Boar prisoners of war to this tiny place."
00:22:20,00:22:22,"God knows how they suddenly accommodated them,"
00:22:22,00:22:26,"and there was one prisoner of war called Andrés Smorenberg,"
00:22:26,00:22:29,"who made this crate, and he wrote on it,"
00:22:29,00:22:33,"""Curios Only"" inside here, and then he climbed in,"
00:22:33,00:22:35,and he got the crate put in a place
00:22:35,00:22:38,"where it was gonna be picked up by a passing mail ship,"
00:22:38,00:22:41,"put a fake address on in London,"
00:22:41,00:22:44,"filled it with like clothes and matches and water,"
00:22:44,00:22:46,and bedded down for the 20-day journey.
00:22:46,00:22:49,"And sadly, even though, that's what I said,"
00:22:49,00:22:53,"even though he marked it with care and this side up,"
00:22:53,00:22:56,"it was tossed around quite badly,"
00:22:56,00:22:58,"and he was very severely concussed,"
00:22:58,00:23:00,"and then when they landed at Ascension Island,"
00:23:00,00:23:03,they got out sort of an unconscious damaged man
00:23:03,00:23:05,and sent him straight back to St Helena.
00:23:05,00:23:06,"- Oh, so he didn't die, okay."
00:23:06,00:23:07,"- He didn't die, no, but--"
00:23:07,00:23:10,- They left him in someone's bin area for a few days.
00:23:10,00:23:11,(laughing)
00:23:11,00:23:15,"- So St Helena and the RMS St Helena, the boat"
00:23:15,00:23:16,"that you used to get there on,"
00:23:16,00:23:18,"both, of course, named after the actual St Helena,"
00:23:18,00:23:20,"which I'm sure you knew,"
00:23:20,00:23:24,"the mother of the Emperor Constantine, and also a saint,"
00:23:24,00:23:28,"famous for discovering parts of the true cross,"
00:23:28,00:23:30,which she excavated from the Holy Land
00:23:30,00:23:32,when she was visiting there.
00:23:32,00:23:34,"She excavated three crosses, actually,"
00:23:34,00:23:36,but she knew she'd got the real one
00:23:36,00:23:37,when it created a miracle
00:23:37,00:23:40,by curing a sick woman who touched it.
00:23:40,00:23:43,"But not only that, she also discovered the true nails"
00:23:43,00:23:47,that were holding the cross and Jesus onto the cross.
00:23:47,00:23:50,- The true hammer that was used to bang the nails in.
00:23:50,00:23:52,"- No, no, that isn't mentioned in my research,"
00:23:52,00:23:56,"but the nails were there, and also uniquely,"
00:23:56,00:23:59,"the Holy Rope that Jesus was tied to the cross with,"
00:23:59,00:24:03,"which is unique, it's the only relic of the Holy Rope."
00:24:03,00:24:06,"- How interesting, because I was taught at school"
00:24:06,00:24:10,"that he was nailed and that the other thieves were tied,"
00:24:10,00:24:11,and he wasn't tied.
00:24:11,00:24:13,- It could have been one of the thieves is--
00:24:13,00:24:14,"- I mean, it's all made up, isn't it?"
00:24:14,00:24:17,"- Well, we don't know where she was born,"
00:24:17,00:24:19,"but that's the thing, and there's an old British legend"
00:24:19,00:24:22,that she was a British princess.
00:24:22,00:24:23,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:24:23,00:24:25,- The daughter of old King Cole of Colchester.
00:24:25,00:24:27,"- Of old Mary the Old Soul, babe."
00:24:27,00:24:31,"- Yes, and Colchester has, on its coat of arms,"
00:24:31,00:24:33,it has the three nails that she discovered.
00:24:33,00:24:34,- Really?
00:24:34,00:24:35,- Yeah.
00:24:35,00:24:36,"- Oh, wow."
00:24:36,00:24:37,- That's very good.
00:24:37,00:24:38,"Well, this is interesting."
00:24:38,00:24:41,So where do you think the second largest collection
00:24:41,00:24:44,of St. Helinian's saints?
00:24:44,00:24:45,- Saints is what they're called.
00:24:45,00:24:47,- The saints are.
00:24:47,00:24:49,"- Well, I'm gonna say St. Helin's, I reckon."
00:24:49,00:24:52,"- And Merseyside, they got distracted."
00:24:52,00:24:55,"- It's not, it's Swindon."
00:24:55,00:24:56,- Is it?
00:24:56,00:24:57,- No.
00:24:57,00:25:00,"- Swindolina, as it's known to the locals in Swindon."
00:25:00,00:25:01,"- Oh, no."
00:25:01,00:25:04,"- Like St. Helina, Swindolina."
00:25:04,00:25:06,"- Swindolina, there's about a fifth"
00:25:06,00:25:08,of what the current population
00:25:08,00:25:09,in actual St. Helina is in Swindon.
00:25:09,00:25:11,So there's like 800 people there.
00:25:11,00:25:12,- What are they doing there?
00:25:12,00:25:13,"- Well, they were all given British nationalship"
00:25:13,00:25:16,in 2002 after the Falkland Wars.
00:25:16,00:25:19,"And so if you want to go meet locals from St. Helina,"
00:25:19,00:25:20,go to Swindon.
00:25:20,00:25:20,- How cool.
00:25:20,00:25:22,- Didn't John Richardson move to Swindon?
00:25:22,00:25:23,- He did move to Swindon.
00:25:23,00:25:25,"- He did move there, he moved there"
00:25:25,00:25:28,because he worked out that it had the best transport links
00:25:28,00:25:30,in the whole of the UK.
00:25:30,00:25:31,"- Yeah, to get into London"
00:25:31,00:25:33,and to get to the gigs he'd needed to.
00:25:33,00:25:34,"That's right, God, he's more prolific"
00:25:34,00:25:36,"than we've given him credit for, really."
00:25:36,00:25:37,"- Oh, we're trying to get him on this show."
00:25:37,00:25:39,What's going on there?
00:25:39,00:25:41,(upbeat music)
00:25:43,00:25:46,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three."
00:25:46,00:25:47,And that is my fact.
00:25:47,00:25:51,My fact this week is that to go into
00:25:51,00:25:54,"the BBC's sound department in Made of Vale,"
00:25:54,00:25:56,you have to walk down a set of steps
00:25:56,00:25:58,"that are each one third concrete,"
00:25:58,00:26:01,one third carpet and one third wood.
00:26:01,00:26:03,This is amazing.
00:26:03,00:26:06,"I saw this fact, I should say,"
00:26:06,00:26:08,when I was just scrolling through Facebook earlier this year
00:26:08,00:26:12,"and Tony Wei, who I'm friends with, he's a movie star."
00:26:12,00:26:14,"He's in The Edge of Tomorrow, the Tom Cruise movie."
00:26:14,00:26:15,"- All right, Plank."
00:26:15,00:26:19,"- Yeah, he's also in a lot of British sitcoms,"
00:26:19,00:26:22,black books and anything you can think of after life
00:26:22,00:26:24,"with Ricky Gervais, he's a great actor."
00:26:24,00:26:28,He was there and he took a photo event and showed it
00:26:28,00:26:29,and it's pretty amazing.
00:26:29,00:26:32,So when I say that the staircase is a third of each.
00:26:32,00:26:33,- It's like you've got a runner down the middle
00:26:33,00:26:35,but either side is different.
00:26:35,00:26:36,- That's a very good way of putting it.
00:26:36,00:26:39,"Yeah, so this is where the BBC do their foley,"
00:26:39,00:26:40,"which is the sound effects,"
00:26:40,00:26:44,"the extra noises that go into TV, radio and movies."
00:26:44,00:26:47,"And they have a whole bottom floor there,"
00:26:47,00:26:49,which is pretty extraordinary when you get a walk through it.
00:26:49,00:26:52,"So I watched a video of Sean Keveney doing it,"
00:26:52,00:26:53,the radio.
00:26:53,00:26:54,"- Another friend of yours, is he done?"
00:26:54,00:26:57,"- Actually is, yeah, he actually is."
00:26:57,00:27:00,So they have a kitchen that's set up and it's all mic'd up
00:27:00,00:27:03,and so you can make tea and you can slam cupboards
00:27:03,00:27:04,and you can move bottles.
00:27:04,00:27:06,"So anytime they need that, that's all done there."
00:27:06,00:27:09,They have a room where it's just full of seaweed and sand
00:27:09,00:27:11,and little mats that you can walk on
00:27:11,00:27:13,"that can create the sound of the ocean,"
00:27:13,00:27:16,the forest with the magnetic tapes or compressed snow
00:27:16,00:27:18,when you throw the mat on top of sand.
00:27:18,00:27:19,- Seaweed. - That's great.
00:27:19,00:27:21,"- Yeah, I mean, now that you say that."
00:27:21,00:27:22,- What noise is the seaweed making?
00:27:22,00:27:23,- Yeah.
00:27:23,00:27:24,- Is that just the sound of seaweed?
00:27:24,00:27:24,- That's a really good point.
00:27:24,00:27:26,It must be artificial.
00:27:26,00:27:28,It looked exactly like seaweed in the-
00:27:28,00:27:30,- Is it seaweed inside the water?
00:27:30,00:27:32,"- No, no, this is just on the floor."
00:27:32,00:27:34,- That the seaweed would just dry out in about two minutes.
00:27:34,00:27:35,"- Well, they've probably got a seaweed person"
00:27:35,00:27:37,"who, the interns job on your first day."
00:27:37,00:27:39,- I know it wouldn't have been seaweed.
00:27:39,00:27:41,"- So when I worked in radio and when I started,"
00:27:41,00:27:44,"we used to use quarter inch tape, recording tape"
00:27:44,00:27:47,for lots of effects like walking through grass.
00:27:47,00:27:48,- Yeah. - You'd rustle that.
00:27:48,00:27:49,"- Well, that's what they had though."
00:27:49,00:27:52,"Yeah, all this tape that was in piles."
00:27:52,00:27:54,"And I messaged Tony to say,"
00:27:54,00:27:55,is there anything else that you saw there?
00:27:55,00:27:58,And he said there's also a foley coat.
00:27:58,00:27:59,So it's made of different fabrics.
00:27:59,00:28:01,"It's a coat you put on, made of different fabrics"
00:28:01,00:28:03,with different kinds of zips and fastenings attached
00:28:03,00:28:06,"to replicate any kind of clothing sound that you want,"
00:28:06,00:28:07,but all in one coat.
00:28:07,00:28:09,- That looks like it would be a really cool coat.
00:28:09,00:28:10,"- No, Anna."
00:28:10,00:28:13,How often have you been getting off a train
00:28:13,00:28:14,"and you're like, I need my ticket"
00:28:14,00:28:16,and you've only got five pockets.
00:28:16,00:28:18,You've no idea which pocket it's in.
00:28:18,00:28:20,- And you're making a mad array of noises.
00:28:20,00:28:22,(laughing)
00:28:22,00:28:23,"Sorry, guys."
00:28:23,00:28:25,"- So I wonder if that foley coat was used,"
00:28:25,00:28:28,"there's a very famous story about Mrs. Dale's diary,"
00:28:28,00:28:32,which was the sort of forerunner of the arches way back when.
00:28:32,00:28:33,They were trying to get the sound
00:28:33,00:28:35,of somebody opening a parcel.
00:28:35,00:28:37,Mrs. Dale was delivered a parcel.
00:28:37,00:28:39,They tried paper and sound like it.
00:28:39,00:28:41,"'Cause famously in sound effects,"
00:28:41,00:28:42,"often you think of a helicopter,"
00:28:42,00:28:45,sounds like (imitates helicopter sounds)
00:28:45,00:28:47,"which we used to make using what's called a double ender,"
00:28:47,00:28:49,which is a wire with two brass plugs on the end.
00:28:49,00:28:50,- Right.
00:28:50,00:28:51,"- It sounds like a helicopter,"
00:28:51,00:28:53,'cause what a helicopter actually sounds like
00:28:53,00:28:55,is not like what you think a helicopter's supposed
00:28:55,00:28:56,to sound like.
00:28:56,00:28:57,"- No, it's just very, very loud hum."
00:28:57,00:28:59,"- It's a loud engine, yeah."
00:28:59,00:29:00,"- You can't really hear what you're saying, yeah."
00:29:00,00:29:03,"- So anyway, somebody undid their zip as an experiment"
00:29:03,00:29:05,"and the producer said, what's that?"
00:29:05,00:29:06,- That's an amazing sound.
00:29:06,00:29:08,That's perfect parcel opening.
00:29:08,00:29:12,"So when the script comes, Mrs. Dale, oh, hello there."
00:29:12,00:29:13,(imitates helicopter sounds)
00:29:13,00:29:14,"Oh, what have you got in there?"
00:29:14,00:29:15,She said.
00:29:15,00:29:17,(laughing)
00:29:17,00:29:19,"- Okay, I'm seeing where the double ender name"
00:29:19,00:29:20,came from.
00:29:20,00:29:21,(laughing)
00:29:21,00:29:23,I really hadn't quite realized
00:29:23,00:29:25,"that what being a Foley artist entailed,"
00:29:25,00:29:27,and I think I want it as a job.
00:29:27,00:29:30,It's so cool if you're working in the films.
00:29:30,00:29:32,"Basically, they'll be sent the film"
00:29:32,00:29:34,and they'll come into a room and they've got all their props
00:29:34,00:29:35,"and often they've collected,"
00:29:35,00:29:37,I think all Foley artists collect just like hundreds
00:29:37,00:29:39,and hundreds of different props.
00:29:39,00:29:40,"Bring them in, lay them all out."
00:29:40,00:29:42,And they've got a script which tells them vaguely
00:29:42,00:29:43,"what sounds to make,"
00:29:43,00:29:45,"but then they watch the film and live,"
00:29:45,00:29:48,they try to imitate what the person's doing.
00:29:48,00:29:49,"So you see them sort of jerking around,"
00:29:49,00:29:51,clutching at something quickly.
00:29:51,00:29:52,"Stomp, stomp, stomp."
00:29:52,00:29:55,"They have to grab a shoe, reach for a cloth."
00:29:55,00:29:56,"It's amazing, isn't it?"
00:29:56,00:29:56,- It is amazing.
00:29:56,00:30:00,"And those items, if it makes the perfect sound,"
00:30:00,00:30:01,you just want to keep it forever.
00:30:01,00:30:04,And they get passed down from generation to generation.
00:30:04,00:30:09,So I was reading an interview with someone called Alison D. Moore
00:30:09,00:30:13,and her former partner in Foley had retired
00:30:13,00:30:15,and he gave her a copper towel bar
00:30:15,00:30:18,with a koi fish on each end.
00:30:18,00:30:19,"And when you twisted it,"
00:30:19,00:30:22,it made a screech that sounded exactly like a startled cat.
00:30:22,00:30:25,"And he was like, this is my pride and joy."
00:30:25,00:30:27,"I take it everywhere I go,"
00:30:27,00:30:29,but you can have it now I've retired.
00:30:29,00:30:31,- Wow. - So good.
00:30:31,00:30:32,"- The BBC, I wondered, John,"
00:30:32,00:30:34,"when you were saying that about the Foley sounds,"
00:30:34,00:30:35,"was that live radio,"
00:30:35,00:30:37,the Foley was happening live along with it?
00:30:37,00:30:41,- I did very little actual live radio.
00:30:41,00:30:45,"No, you just add the sound effects as you went along."
00:30:45,00:30:47,"Well, you were recording live, of course."
00:30:47,00:30:49,"And it was a famous, not famous to you,"
00:30:49,00:30:52,"but to me, I used to do a radio show"
00:30:52,00:30:53,called The News Hudlines with Roy Hardy.
00:30:53,00:30:55,It was incredibly quick on the draw.
00:30:55,00:30:58,"A bit like a sort of Lee Mack of his day, very fast."
00:30:58,00:31:02,And there was a sketch that involved a fridge.
00:31:02,00:31:03,"And in the script,"
00:31:03,00:31:07,the studio manager saw SFX door opens.
00:31:07,00:31:08,And that's a standard BBC sound effect
00:31:08,00:31:10,because the rattle of the door knob.
00:31:10,00:31:12,"- Yeah, yeah, like that."
00:31:12,00:31:13,"- And so, it's a,"
00:31:13,00:31:15,"Rory said, I'll just look in the fridge."
00:31:15,00:31:16,"And there was a,"
00:31:16,00:31:18,"he said, oh, a wooden fridge."
00:31:18,00:31:21,It's a wonderful moment.
00:31:21,00:31:23,"- It is amazing, but it was really,"
00:31:23,00:31:26,"it was a very strong thing with the BBC for live radio,"
00:31:26,00:31:27,"particularly comedy shows,"
00:31:27,00:31:28,like The Goon Show.
00:31:28,00:31:30,And there was a famous incident where
00:31:30,00:31:32,"in the script, Nettie Seagoon,"
00:31:32,00:31:33,"who was played by Harry Seagoon,"
00:31:33,00:31:36,was to be hit by a sock full of custard.
00:31:36,00:31:38,And they tried all these different sounds.
00:31:38,00:31:39,They couldn't get it.
00:31:39,00:31:41,And Spike Milligan got so frustrated during rehearsal
00:31:41,00:31:42,that he took his sock off.
00:31:42,00:31:43,"He grabbed an assistant,"
00:31:43,00:31:46,"sent them to the BBC canteen to fill it up with custard,"
00:31:46,00:31:48,"which they did, brought it back,"
00:31:48,00:31:50,walloped Harry Seagoon over the head with it.
00:31:50,00:31:52,And it still didn't get the sound that they need.
00:31:52,00:31:54,But that story got out.
00:31:54,00:31:56,And the BBC got lots of complaints
00:31:56,00:31:59,because this was in the last year of post-war rationing.
00:31:59,00:32:01,"And they said, you are wasting good custard."
00:32:01,00:32:03,- Do they not drink it afterwards out of the cell?
00:32:03,00:32:05,"- Well, regardless of what they did."
00:32:05,00:32:06,"- No, that is wasteful."
00:32:06,00:32:08,"- 'Cause they usually say on those programmes,"
00:32:08,00:32:10,"""Don't worry, the food was shared amongst the crew"
00:32:10,00:32:12,"""afterwards."" - Yes, yeah."
00:32:12,00:32:14,"- Those bizarre sound effects,"
00:32:14,00:32:16,I remember I used to briefly please the programme
00:32:16,00:32:17,"called The Burgess Wave,"
00:32:17,00:32:20,written by David Romick and Andrew Marshall.
00:32:20,00:32:22,And they used to take great pleasure
00:32:22,00:32:24,in writing sound effects for impossible to do.
00:32:24,00:32:27,"And I remember one was SFX,"
00:32:27,00:32:30,Genghis Khan slices somebody's stomach off.
00:32:30,00:32:33,"- Oh, wow. - It was quite a while,"
00:32:33,00:32:35,that took to get right. - What did you do for that?
00:32:35,00:32:36,- What did you do?
00:32:36,00:32:37,"- Well, I went to the canteen."
00:32:37,00:32:38,I got a fresh stomach.
00:32:38,00:32:41,(all laughing)
00:32:41,00:32:43,It is interesting.
00:32:43,00:32:47,It's one of those unsung things in movies and television
00:32:47,00:32:49,"because without those little sounds,"
00:32:49,00:32:52,it doesn't have heft at all.
00:32:52,00:32:54,"When we did the first episode of Splitting Image,"
00:32:54,00:32:56,we decided not to have a laugh track
00:32:56,00:32:58,"'cause I don't know why,"
00:32:58,00:33:01,"but no time, I think."
00:33:01,00:33:03,And it seemed completely boring
00:33:03,00:33:04,'cause we used to make Splitting Image
00:33:04,00:33:06,by recording the voice track first
00:33:06,00:33:08,and then they puppeteer's mime to it.
00:33:08,00:33:11,"And of course, they're made of rubber."
00:33:11,00:33:14,So when a puppet touched the desk
00:33:14,00:33:16,"and it was a pre-recorded thing, nothing happened."
00:33:16,00:33:18,"So the two guys, two sound guys,"
00:33:18,00:33:21,absolute geniuses stood up literally all night
00:33:21,00:33:23,"doing all that, you know, touching the table,"
00:33:23,00:33:26,"banging each other's heads, scratching their clothes."
00:33:26,00:33:28,And suddenly it comes alive.
00:33:28,00:33:30,"No, it was an amazing thing"
00:33:30,00:33:33,'cause actually we owe the whole existence
00:33:33,00:33:34,of Splitting Image to those two guys.
00:33:34,00:33:36,- Yeah.
00:33:36,00:33:39,I was talking about this Foley artist called Alison D. Moore.
00:33:39,00:33:40,I read an interview with her.
00:33:40,00:33:41,It was really interesting.
00:33:41,00:33:43,She said that there are more astronauts on earth
00:33:43,00:33:46,than people working in Foley at the moment.
00:33:46,00:33:47,- What?
00:33:47,00:33:50,- So I reckon that there's about 100 people doing Foley.
00:33:50,00:33:54,And there are more people who've been in space than that.
00:33:54,00:33:56,She said that they can literally change the rating
00:33:56,00:33:59,of a film by the sounds that they put in.
00:33:59,00:34:04,"So if there is, for instance, an oral sex scene,"
00:34:04,00:34:07,"if they make it sound really filthy,"
00:34:07,00:34:10,then it can go up from a 15 to an 18.
00:34:10,00:34:12,"- But what's the, what's the, is it just like..."
00:34:12,00:34:16,"- That's normal oral sex, that's how that sounds."
00:34:16,00:34:19,- I think that downgrades it to like a U if you do that.
00:34:20,00:34:23,"- It is important to say that the Foley is a specific thing,"
00:34:23,00:34:25,which is something that's made on the spot.
00:34:25,00:34:27,Isn't it not like a recording?
00:34:27,00:34:28,- Yeah.
00:34:28,00:34:29,- That doesn't count as a Foley.
00:34:29,00:34:31,- You get lots of sound effects artists.
00:34:31,00:34:34,- But I just wanted to give some people a hint
00:34:34,00:34:37,"of things, recordings that could be useful in other contexts."
00:34:37,00:34:39,"So for example, the roar of a leopard"
00:34:39,00:34:41,sounds like someone roughly sawing wood.
00:34:41,00:34:42,- Okay.
00:34:42,00:34:43,- Which is useful.
00:34:43,00:34:44,"- Okay, good to know."
00:34:44,00:34:47,"- Bill Bailey said, without the beat in the background,"
00:34:47,00:34:49,jazz basically sounds like an armadillo
00:34:49,00:34:51,was let loose on the keyboard.
00:34:51,00:34:52,So if you wanted that sound...
00:34:52,00:34:56,"- It's amazing though, because since BBC started"
00:34:56,00:35:00,"recording their stuff and other massive production studios,"
00:35:00,00:35:03,there's these huge Foley archives that now exist.
00:35:03,00:35:05,And a lot of them have been made available to the public.
00:35:05,00:35:08,"So the BBC have over 33,000 of its sound effects"
00:35:08,00:35:11,that are just on a website you can download
00:35:11,00:35:13,and use as part of whatever you want to use.
00:35:13,00:35:15,It's open to the public.
00:35:15,00:35:17,Hanna-Barbera also is used a lot.
00:35:17,00:35:21,So Hanna-Barbera that made the Flintstones and so on.
00:35:21,00:35:24,Their sounds have been used in so many places
00:35:24,00:35:26,you wouldn't expect multiple Mario Kart
00:35:26,00:35:28,and Mario video games have the sounds
00:35:28,00:35:30,that would have been used in the Flintstones
00:35:30,00:35:32,that are sort of peppered all the way through.
00:35:32,00:35:33,- Really?
00:35:33,00:35:34,- Yeah.
00:35:34,00:35:35,- And they made those sounds by getting a pterodactyl
00:35:35,00:35:37,to put their beak on a record player.
00:35:37,00:35:40,(laughing)
00:35:40,00:35:43,"- Yeah, but it's, yeah, it's pretty wild."
00:35:43,00:35:46,"And we missed, I think it was the first 10 years"
00:35:46,00:35:49,of any kind of recording with BBC radio
00:35:49,00:35:52,until the arrival of a thing called the Blatner phone.
00:35:52,00:35:54,It was only one machine that was recording
00:35:54,00:35:55,all the radio output at the time
00:35:55,00:35:57,that was coming from the BBC.
00:35:57,00:35:59,"And it wasn't a great recording necessarily,"
00:35:59,00:36:03,"but the machine, the spools that would hold the tape"
00:36:03,00:36:05,were ginormous and the tape would be traveling
00:36:05,00:36:06,at really high speeds.
00:36:06,00:36:09,So it would be traveling at five feet per second
00:36:09,00:36:11,"to record it, which was really dangerous"
00:36:11,00:36:13,for anyone who had to monitor the tape
00:36:13,00:36:15,"because if it broke off,"
00:36:15,00:36:18,it would be like shrapnel shooting out the tape.
00:36:18,00:36:19,And it was like a razor's edge.
00:36:19,00:36:21,You would be cut to pieces if it shot.
00:36:21,00:36:23,"- Oh, like a ninja?"
00:36:23,00:36:23,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:36:23,00:36:24,So it was incredibly dangerous.
00:36:24,00:36:25,- That's a great murder mystery.
00:36:25,00:36:26,That should be a Jonathan Creek episode.
00:36:26,00:36:28,"- Yes, that's true, yeah."
00:36:28,00:36:29,"And that would happen, it would be more dangerous"
00:36:29,00:36:32,"because eventually they got two of these machines,"
00:36:32,00:36:34,"the Blatner phone, which meant that they could change tape"
00:36:34,00:36:36,on one while recording on the other.
00:36:36,00:36:38,So that was a seriously dangerous thing.
00:36:38,00:36:40,They used to have to wear heavy gloves
00:36:40,00:36:42,and any time they were doing something
00:36:42,00:36:42,"that looked a bit delicate,"
00:36:42,00:36:44,they would run to the other side of the room
00:36:44,00:36:46,in case it exploded on them.
00:36:46,00:36:47,"- Hang on, presumably when you change the tape,"
00:36:47,00:36:48,"you stop the, you stop the tape."
00:36:48,00:36:50,"- Yeah, yeah, but just, I mean, the think and overheat,"
00:36:50,00:36:53,"they had incidences basically, where it just got too much."
00:36:53,00:36:55,- It was the most dangerous job in the world
00:36:55,00:36:57,working for the BBC in the '50s.
00:36:57,00:36:57,- It was.
00:36:57,00:36:58,- I'm the '70s.
00:36:58,00:36:59,(laughing)
00:36:59,00:37:02,(upbeat music)
00:37:02,00:37:07,"- Okay, it is time for a final fact of the show"
00:37:07,00:37:09,and that is Anna.
00:37:09,00:37:10,"- My fact this week is that every year,"
00:37:10,00:37:14,tens of thousands of people attend Rwanda's
00:37:14,00:37:17,annual gorilla baby naming ceremony.
00:37:17,00:37:21,"- Oh, that sounds good. - Isn't it sweet?"
00:37:21,00:37:22,It is good.
00:37:22,00:37:23,- Is it sweet?
00:37:23,00:37:24,"- It is sweet, yes."
00:37:24,00:37:25,"Yeah, yeah, nothing dark to it."
00:37:25,00:37:29,"Quita izina, which means to give a name in Nkinyawanda,"
00:37:29,00:37:31,which is the language.
00:37:31,00:37:33,And this is so cool.
00:37:33,00:37:36,It's this whole full week of activities devoted to gorillas
00:37:36,00:37:39,and it's all about their conservation and their protection
00:37:39,00:37:40,'cause there's a huge deal in Rwanda.
00:37:40,00:37:42,And the highlight is this naming ceremony
00:37:42,00:37:46,"where they've got a huge, really cool looking stage,"
00:37:46,00:37:49,which is a wicker sculpture of a gorilla
00:37:49,00:37:52,or a bamboo sculpture of a gorilla the size of a house.
00:37:52,00:37:55,And then a celebrity and all researchers.
00:37:55,00:37:56,- Who's the celebrity?
00:37:56,00:37:58,- Lots of different celebrities.
00:37:58,00:37:59,We'll get to the list.
00:37:59,00:38:01,- Probably some of your mates.
00:38:01,00:38:02,(laughing)
00:38:02,00:38:05,- John Richardson's gotta have a look in naming a gorilla.
00:38:05,00:38:07,"- John Keveny goes there often, doesn't he?"
00:38:07,00:38:08,- Yeah.
00:38:09,00:38:11,- There are multiple characters who will come up on stage
00:38:11,00:38:14,and then they'll name one of the new baby gorillas
00:38:14,00:38:15,that's been born that year.
00:38:15,00:38:16,And a big picture comes up behind
00:38:16,00:38:19,"and they say, I name this gorilla"
00:38:19,00:38:20,and they give them sensible.
00:38:20,00:38:22,They don't call them sort of barry.
00:38:22,00:38:26,"- Well, quite a lot of the Arsenal footballers go there"
00:38:26,00:38:28,'cause Arsenal are sponsored by Rwanda.
00:38:28,00:38:29,"- So they are, yeah."
00:38:29,00:38:31,So 'cause the president's a big Arsenal fan.
00:38:31,00:38:32,"- He is, yeah."
00:38:32,00:38:34,"So in 2018, Alex Scott went."
00:38:34,00:38:37,"In 2019, David Louise went."
00:38:37,00:38:42,"In 2020, Hector Bellerin and Patrick Obamiang went."
00:38:42,00:38:47,"Obamiang named a 14-year-old gorilla Ligitego, meaning goal,"
00:38:47,00:38:53,"and Bellerin chose Mjugarriro, meaning defender."
00:38:53,00:38:55,So it's like appropriate stuff for them.
00:38:55,00:38:58,So maybe next year they'll be runner-up
00:38:58,00:39:01,or smashed by Paris Saint-Germain.
00:39:01,00:39:02,- Boom.
00:39:04,00:39:07,- So do these poor gorillas have to wait
00:39:07,00:39:10,sometimes nearly a year before they get a name?
00:39:10,00:39:11,"- Yes, I suppose they do."
00:39:11,00:39:12,They probably have a holding name.
00:39:12,00:39:15,- They might have their own name in their own language
00:39:15,00:39:17,and they might not care what we call them.
00:39:17,00:39:18,"- No, I doubt it."
00:39:18,00:39:19,"- That's it, well, no, they couldn't."
00:39:19,00:39:21,"I don't know about gorillas,"
00:39:21,00:39:23,but did you know that Marma sets
00:39:23,00:39:26,are the only non-human primate that call each other by name?
00:39:26,00:39:27,- Do they?
00:39:27,00:39:28,- Yeah.
00:39:28,00:39:29,"And they say, ""Hello, Barry."""
00:39:29,00:39:31,- And there's always Barry.
00:39:31,00:39:32,- Always Barry.
00:39:32,00:39:33,They all call Barry.
00:39:33,00:39:34,"- It's got a point in us, really."
00:39:34,00:39:35,- Of course it may not be their name at all.
00:39:35,00:39:37,"It may be just a, all right, Sam."
00:39:37,00:39:38,- It's just a burp.
00:39:38,00:39:43,"Idris Elba called, they get big names."
00:39:43,00:39:45,"Called Juan Narame, meaning long life."
00:39:45,00:39:48,David Attenborough's obviously named one.
00:39:48,00:39:49,"But yeah, it sounds really fun."
00:39:49,00:39:51,And the idea is to protect gorillas.
00:39:51,00:39:53,And the story of protecting gorillas in Rwanda
00:39:53,00:39:56,"is an amazing success story, isn't it?"
00:39:56,00:39:57,So they-
00:39:57,00:39:58,- Diane Fossey.
00:39:58,00:40:02,"- Diane Fossey, yes, who I'm sure we'll talk about."
00:40:02,00:40:04,"It's estimated that one mountain gorilla,"
00:40:04,00:40:05,and it's mountain gorillas there.
00:40:05,00:40:08,So there are four species and subspecies of gorilla.
00:40:08,00:40:11,But one mountain gorilla can generate $3 million
00:40:11,00:40:12,during its lifetime from tourism.
00:40:12,00:40:15,And that all goes back into conservation.
00:40:15,00:40:16,To protection.
00:40:16,00:40:19,"To the extent, and I found this really interesting."
00:40:19,00:40:20,"So there are, like I say,"
00:40:20,00:40:23,four species and subspecies of gorilla.
00:40:23,00:40:24,"There's western lowland,"
00:40:24,00:40:29,"of which there are between 150 and 300,000."
00:40:29,00:40:29,Remember that.
00:40:29,00:40:31,"There's cross river gorillas,"
00:40:31,00:40:32,of which there are about 300.
00:40:32,00:40:33,"Mountain gorilla,"
00:40:33,00:40:35,"I think there are about 800 to 1,000."
00:40:35,00:40:38,"And grower's gorilla, 6,500."
00:40:38,00:40:40,"All are critically endangered,"
00:40:40,00:40:43,"except one, which is just endangered."
00:40:43,00:40:43,- Right.
00:40:43,00:40:45,"- Now, have you memorized all the figures?"
00:40:45,00:40:47,"- Yeah, the lowland western gorillas, you said."
00:40:47,00:40:48,- There you go.
00:40:48,00:40:50,"The western lowland, 150 to 300,000."
00:40:50,00:40:52,Surely they're just endangered.
00:40:52,00:40:54,"No, they're critically endangered."
00:40:54,00:40:56,And the mountain gorilla from Rwanda
00:40:56,00:40:58,"is the only one that's only endangered,"
00:40:58,00:41:00,"even though there are only 800,"
00:41:00,00:41:01,because their numbers are going up.
00:41:01,00:41:02,- Because they're going up.
00:41:02,00:41:04,"But that's, I think that's how they do it, right?"
00:41:04,00:41:05,"- No, of course it's how they do it."
00:41:05,00:41:07,But I think it's an extraordinary discrepancy
00:41:07,00:41:11,"between 300,800, but only one is critically endangered."
00:41:11,00:41:13,"- And it's kind of surprising that they're going up,"
00:41:13,00:41:16,"well, certainly over the last 30 years or so,"
00:41:16,00:41:18,'cause they had a big old war in Rwanda.
00:41:18,00:41:19,- Yeah.
00:41:19,00:41:21,"- And in actual facts,"
00:41:21,00:41:24,there were 16 gorillas killed during that civil war.
00:41:24,00:41:26,But the population still--
00:41:26,00:41:27,- This is a problem now.
00:41:27,00:41:29,Gorillas or guerrillas?
00:41:29,00:41:32,"- Yeah, guerrillas or guerrillas."
00:41:32,00:41:34,"- I should check that actually,"
00:41:34,00:41:36,that I'm not talking about guerrillas.
00:41:36,00:41:38,- What do you call a gorilla with a machine gun?
00:41:38,00:41:39,"- I don't know, John."
00:41:39,00:41:40,- Sir.
00:41:40,00:41:42,(laughing)
00:41:42,00:41:45,"- But yeah, basically the gorillas moved up"
00:41:45,00:41:46,into the mountains away from all the humans
00:41:46,00:41:48,and all the violence.
00:41:48,00:41:50,And so that's why their numbers went way higher.
00:41:50,00:41:52,"And also, none of the factions"
00:41:52,00:41:54,wanted the bad publicity of killing gorillas.
00:41:54,00:41:55,- Yeah.
00:41:55,00:41:56,"- So yeah, they--"
00:41:56,00:41:58,"- And that is amazing, but mostly the reason,"
00:41:58,00:41:59,"'cause it is such a success story,"
00:41:59,00:42:01,is because Rwanda's run an extraordinary
00:42:01,00:42:04,"protection program since then,"
00:42:04,00:42:06,which basically means that they--
00:42:06,00:42:07,- How have they stopped the poaching?
00:42:07,00:42:09,Is there sort of security force?
00:42:09,00:42:10,- There's just been an amazing investment
00:42:10,00:42:11,in local communities.
00:42:11,00:42:12,"So a lot of the poachers,"
00:42:12,00:42:14,"'cause people, I always think poachers get a bad rep,"
00:42:14,00:42:16,"largely they're poaching for survival, right?"
00:42:16,00:42:17,That these were people in a country
00:42:17,00:42:20,"that were so poor, people were struggling,"
00:42:20,00:42:22,and the poachers are now involved in conservation.
00:42:22,00:42:23,So there are a lot of poachers
00:42:23,00:42:25,who do various tourist things now.
00:42:25,00:42:28,And it's just giving them real national pride
00:42:28,00:42:30,"in this thing, like this big ceremony,"
00:42:30,00:42:31,which means it literally doesn't happen.
00:42:31,00:42:32,"- Yeah, because they worked out, as you say,"
00:42:32,00:42:35,one gorilla can bring 3 million in an entire lifetime.
00:42:35,00:42:38,So it's more profitable now to be a tourist guide
00:42:38,00:42:40,rather than to kill one and get a one-off payment.
00:42:40,00:42:44,"Which, and so that, I mean, it has largely come down"
00:42:44,00:42:46,from the stuff I've read to Diane Fosse.
00:42:46,00:42:48,"I mean, I know she's the ambassador name,"
00:42:48,00:42:51,"but she really kind of, she moved there back in the '70s,"
00:42:51,00:42:53,"plopped herself on the side of the mountain,"
00:42:53,00:42:55,when there was virtually no one doing that.
00:42:55,00:42:56,"She was given a name,"
00:42:56,00:42:59,which was the woman who lives alone in the forest
00:42:59,00:42:59,by all the locals.
00:42:59,00:43:01,"- Big ceremony, was it?"
00:43:01,00:43:03,(all laughing)
00:43:03,00:43:05,- Natalie Potman Cableog.
00:43:05,00:43:07,- She had to wait a year before they thought of it.
00:43:07,00:43:11,"- But yeah, so Diane Fosse, the reason she went out there"
00:43:11,00:43:14,"was this was off the back of a man called Lewis Leakey,"
00:43:14,00:43:16,"who we've mentioned before,"
00:43:16,00:43:17,one of my favorite people in the world
00:43:17,00:43:20,"of paleoanthropology, had wild theories"
00:43:20,00:43:22,and also had a lot of discoveries
00:43:22,00:43:26,about ancient versions of Homo sapiens and so on.
00:43:26,00:43:29,"- Dan, a few episodes ago, we had to fade you out"
00:43:29,00:43:31,when you started going into this kind of thing.
00:43:31,00:43:31,(all laughing)
00:43:31,00:43:32,"- Well, he thinks that the reason"
00:43:32,00:43:34,that we became the dominant species of planet Earth
00:43:34,00:43:36,"is because we were too smelly to eat,"
00:43:36,00:43:39,"as we were in the wild, he's a brilliant guy."
00:43:39,00:43:42,But he thought that the people who should go out
00:43:42,00:43:44,and study apes should be a single woman
00:43:44,00:43:46,with no scientific training.
00:43:46,00:43:50,He's very much the Picasso of the paleoanthropology world
00:43:50,00:43:52,in that he was a bit dubious with women.
00:43:52,00:43:54,He had a lot of researchers around him
00:43:54,00:43:58,"who were, let's say, at his whim."
00:43:58,00:44:01,"He was a bit of deviant, but he did amazing things."
00:44:01,00:44:03,- Did you say he was your favorite?
00:44:03,00:44:04,- Do you know what?
00:44:04,00:44:04,"We can edit that, right?"
00:44:04,00:44:07,(all laughing)
00:44:07,00:44:08,But he picked Diane Fosse.
00:44:08,00:44:10,He thought she'd be perfect.
00:44:10,00:44:11,"And he said to her,"
00:44:11,00:44:12,"""The only thing that you need to have to go out there"
00:44:12,00:44:13,"is no appendix."""
00:44:13,00:44:16,And so she took her appendix out to go.
00:44:16,00:44:17,- Someone else must have taken it out.
00:44:17,00:44:18,"- Yeah, a doctor took it out."
00:44:18,00:44:20,"And then she got a letter six weeks later from him saying,"
00:44:20,00:44:22,"by the way, I was joking about the whole appendix thing."
00:44:22,00:44:24,- No. - Yeah.
00:44:24,00:44:25,It was too late.
00:44:25,00:44:27,She already did it by then.
00:44:27,00:44:28,- That's a problem with deadpan humor.
00:44:28,00:44:30,"If you don't put the emoji afterwards,"
00:44:30,00:44:32,we wouldn't get it.
00:44:32,00:44:34,"- She was quite controversial though, Diane Fosse, right?"
00:44:34,00:44:35,- Absolutely.
00:44:35,00:44:37,"- I read that once she captured,"
00:44:37,00:44:41,"or her associates captured a poacher,"
00:44:41,00:44:43,"stripped him of his clothes,"
00:44:43,00:44:44,laid him spread eagle on the ground
00:44:44,00:44:46,and lashed his genitals with nettles.
00:44:46,00:44:48,"- Yeah, that's how I saw it."
00:44:48,00:44:49,- And she thought basically the way
00:44:49,00:44:52,"that you deal with poachers is not like Anna says,"
00:44:52,00:44:54,improving society and giving them other ways
00:44:54,00:44:55,of making money.
00:44:55,00:44:57,You should just beat it out of them.
00:44:57,00:44:58,- Yeah.
00:44:58,00:45:00,"- I mean, that to be fair is kind of the twist"
00:45:00,00:45:03,in her story is that she arrived as a conservationist.
00:45:03,00:45:04,"She learned so much about gorillas,"
00:45:04,00:45:07,wrote that incredible book.
00:45:07,00:45:07,What's it called?
00:45:07,00:45:09,"- Gorillas in the Mist is a movie based on her, right?"
00:45:09,00:45:11,"- Yeah, based, but that's off her book."
00:45:11,00:45:12,"So she wrote a book,"
00:45:12,00:45:14,which was a memoir of her time there.
00:45:14,00:45:17,And then when poachers killed a gorilla
00:45:17,00:45:19,"that she'd really become close with,"
00:45:19,00:45:21,they'd lobbed the gorillas head off.
00:45:21,00:45:22,"- Digit, it was called digit."
00:45:22,00:45:23,- That's right.
00:45:23,00:45:25,There was a turning point where she goes
00:45:25,00:45:28,from conservationist really to poacher killer.
00:45:28,00:45:30,And she was furious.
00:45:30,00:45:32,And anyone who was in her way was part of the problem.
00:45:32,00:45:34,"So even the anti-poaching league,"
00:45:34,00:45:36,"she thought, no, you're part of it as well."
00:45:36,00:45:37,"And to be fair,"
00:45:37,00:45:38,she had a horrific time in her early days there.
00:45:38,00:45:40,She was kidnapped by rebels.
00:45:40,00:45:42,She was sexually assaulted.
00:45:42,00:45:45,She had a lot of bad times there.
00:45:45,00:45:47,"- Yeah, she was tough as nails, woman."
00:45:47,00:45:49,"I mean, bad childhood tough times there."
00:45:49,00:45:51,Extraordinary person.
00:45:51,00:45:54,"But then she did go a little bit,"
00:45:54,00:45:54,"well, she just went hard line,"
00:45:54,00:45:56,"didn't she, towards the end? - She did."
00:45:56,00:45:57,"- And sort of beat up poachers,"
00:45:57,00:45:58,which is quite hardcore.
00:45:58,00:45:59,And I had actually had no idea
00:45:59,00:46:01,"that she was murdered, Diane Fossey."
00:46:01,00:46:03,"- Yes. - And to research this, but..."
00:46:03,00:46:05,- It's just such a wild story.
00:46:05,00:46:07,So Digit was decapitated by the poachers
00:46:07,00:46:10,and his hands cut off to make ashtrays out of.
00:46:10,00:46:11,- And she was horribly mad.
00:46:11,00:46:12,She was found dead in her cabin
00:46:12,00:46:16,and bizarrely blamed on a jealous fellow researcher
00:46:16,00:46:19,"in absentia, who I don't think was ever really solved."
00:46:19,00:46:21,I think we assume it was angry poachers.
00:46:21,00:46:22,"- Yeah, we still don't know."
00:46:22,00:46:24,There's so many theories out there.
00:46:24,00:46:25,And she's still there though.
00:46:25,00:46:27,She's buried in the gorilla cemetery.
00:46:27,00:46:28,- Next to Digit.
00:46:28,00:46:30,"She's buried next to Digit, yes."
00:46:30,00:46:33,"- Gorillas though, amazing animals."
00:46:33,00:46:35,- They get high by spinning in circles.
00:46:35,00:46:37,That's a new discovery recently.
00:46:37,00:46:41,"And that was like, I really loved this bit of science."
00:46:41,00:46:43,"Basically, there was a viral clip that went around"
00:46:43,00:46:46,of a gorilla spinning round.
00:46:46,00:46:47,"And they thought, oh, that looks fun."
00:46:47,00:46:49,Let's see if anyone else does that.
00:46:49,00:46:51,And then they did more research and found out
00:46:51,00:46:53,"that yeah, they do do that."
00:46:53,00:46:54,"- Well, if you will withhold drugs from the kids,"
00:46:54,00:46:56,"they'll find a way, won't they?"
00:46:56,00:46:58,"They make a, you know how we make a big deal"
00:46:58,00:47:00,about lions and tigers roaring?
00:47:00,00:47:03,I think the gorilla roar is the most frightening.
00:47:03,00:47:05,"So they do that and then they make the belch sound,"
00:47:05,00:47:08,which is the other main kind of vocalization.
00:47:08,00:47:11,"And that's a little, sort of like a little burp or a growl,"
00:47:11,00:47:13,"which says, I'm here, don't worry, I'm your friend."
00:47:13,00:47:15,"And so if researchers are working with gorillas,"
00:47:15,00:47:17,then they learn to make that sound straight away
00:47:17,00:47:19,"to reassure them because you're in the jungle,"
00:47:19,00:47:20,you don't have that good visibility.
00:47:20,00:47:23,So it's not as much about facial recognition.
00:47:23,00:47:26,Although the other thing that researchers have to do
00:47:26,00:47:28,is learn to memorize.
00:47:28,00:47:30,And this is something that I think was pioneered
00:47:30,00:47:31,"a little bit by Diane Fossey,"
00:47:31,00:47:33,but learn to memorize their nose prints.
00:47:33,00:47:35,"So that after a few months,"
00:47:35,00:47:37,you can spot one 50 yards away and immediately know.
00:47:37,00:47:38,"- Well, that makes sense."
00:47:38,00:47:39,- Barry.
00:47:39,00:47:40,"- Yeah, that's great."
00:47:40,00:47:42,- Is it that obvious what the prints are?
00:47:42,00:47:44,Or do you have to get really close?
00:47:44,00:47:45,"'Cause like fingerprints,"
00:47:45,00:47:47,"you need to put your fingers in ink, right?"
00:47:47,00:47:49,- It's definitely more obvious than that.
00:47:49,00:47:52,"It's like wrinkles on a face, on quite a wrinkly face."
00:47:52,00:47:54,- Okay.
00:47:54,00:47:56,I noticed you were looking at me when you said that.
00:47:56,00:47:57,- I was looking past you.
00:47:57,00:48:02,"- Do you know that when you arrive into Rwanda,"
00:48:02,00:48:06,"they go through like any airport security,"
00:48:06,00:48:08,there's certain countries you can't bring fruit in and so on.
00:48:08,00:48:10,Do you know what you're not allowed to bring in to Rwanda?
00:48:10,00:48:12,- Drugs.
00:48:12,00:48:13,- Not drugs.
00:48:13,00:48:14,"- Oh, you are allowed to bring drugs."
00:48:14,00:48:16,"- No, it's just not the answer I'm looking for."
00:48:16,00:48:17,- Okay.
00:48:17,00:48:19,- What's the answer you're looking for?
00:48:19,00:48:21,- Plastic bags.
00:48:21,00:48:23,"- If you go to the official tourism website,"
00:48:23,00:48:25,that's on there saying you will be stopped
00:48:25,00:48:26,and you can get in serious trouble
00:48:26,00:48:29,if you're trying to smuggle plastic bags into the country.
00:48:29,00:48:31,- 12 months in prison for using plastic bags.
00:48:31,00:48:32,- Wow.
00:48:32,00:48:33,- Is it your joking?
00:48:33,00:48:37,- 100% and the fine of up to $540.
00:48:37,00:48:41,Now that law is really in place for large companies
00:48:41,00:48:42,who are breaking the law.
00:48:42,00:48:44,"Like if you or I brought a plastic bag in,"
00:48:44,00:48:46,"we probably wouldn't get 12 months in prison,"
00:48:46,00:48:48,but it is actually on the law books.
00:48:48,00:48:50,That is the punishment.
00:48:50,00:48:51,"- Yeah, I remember that happening."
00:48:51,00:48:52,We all thought mad.
00:48:52,00:48:55,Imagine living without plastic bags.
00:48:55,00:48:57,And now we all sort of do.
00:48:57,00:48:58,"- We don't, do we?"
00:48:58,00:49:00,(all laughing)
00:49:00,00:49:02,- We just pay our 5P and suck it up.
00:49:02,00:49:07,"- I think even though we've had all this talk of guerrillas,"
00:49:07,00:49:10,the favorite animal in Rwanda is the cow.
00:49:11,00:49:13,They're obsessively into cows.
00:49:13,00:49:14,It's great.
00:49:14,00:49:18,And so there's lots of dances inspired by cows.
00:49:18,00:49:19,"So you've got the kind of Rwandan ballet,"
00:49:19,00:49:21,which is inspired by cows
00:49:21,00:49:24,where women emulate cows movements.
00:49:24,00:49:27,Maybe they're more graceful in Rwanda.
00:49:27,00:49:28,- Like what does a cow do?
00:49:28,00:49:30,It just stands there for ages
00:49:30,00:49:32,and occasionally eats a bit of grass.
00:49:32,00:49:35,"- What I, gentle is what I read and I actually didn't watch it."
00:49:35,00:49:37,So gentle movements.
00:49:37,00:49:39,It's a bit of swaying sometimes.
00:49:39,00:49:40,- Swishing away a fly.
00:49:40,00:49:41,- Yeah.
00:49:41,00:49:42,"- It's a tail, it's all in the tail."
00:49:42,00:49:43,- It's very unique.
00:49:43,00:49:44,- All Rwanda women have tails.
00:49:44,00:49:45,Did I not mention that?
00:49:45,00:49:46,"- Oh, is that right?"
00:49:46,00:49:47,- Yeah.
00:49:47,00:49:48,"If you want to wish someone well,"
00:49:48,00:49:51,you say may you have a cow or have thousands of cows.
00:49:51,00:49:54,"- Same in America, don't have a cow man."
00:49:54,00:49:55,- Yeah.
00:49:55,00:49:56,"- Okay, yeah."
00:49:56,00:49:58,"- It's like Helena, cowabunga, as the turtle says."
00:49:58,00:49:59,- Yep.
00:49:59,00:50:00,Okay.
00:50:00,00:50:02,There's a lot of crossover.
00:50:02,00:50:03,But they also love milk.
00:50:03,00:50:07,"And instead of going to a bar in Kigali,"
00:50:07,00:50:07,"capital of Rwanda,"
00:50:07,00:50:10,you will go to a milk bar very often.
00:50:10,00:50:13,"And I think this is since the nineties,"
00:50:13,00:50:15,"when after the genocide,"
00:50:15,00:50:17,there was massive urbanization
00:50:17,00:50:20,and crops were decimated.
00:50:20,00:50:21,A lot of cattle were massacred
00:50:21,00:50:23,and everything changed.
00:50:23,00:50:25,And a lot of people missed that agricultural connection.
00:50:25,00:50:27,And now they all go to milk bars.
00:50:27,00:50:28,- Are they alcoholic milks?
00:50:28,00:50:29,- No.
00:50:29,00:50:30,- You can get that.
00:50:30,00:50:31,- They are not.
00:50:31,00:50:32,- Are they really?
00:50:32,00:50:33,- So they claim.
00:50:33,00:50:34,"It might be that they're all getting pissed,"
00:50:34,00:50:35,but they're all claiming they're just like
00:50:35,00:50:37,a hot or a cold milk.
00:50:37,00:50:39,"- There's also a thing called the Garinka program,"
00:50:39,00:50:41,which is the idea that the government
00:50:41,00:50:44,will give every poor family a cow.
00:50:44,00:50:45,"And over the years,"
00:50:45,00:50:48,"they've given over 400,000 cows to different families."
00:50:48,00:50:51,And the idea is that you can use them in your
00:50:51,00:50:53,to fertilize the land.
00:50:53,00:50:55,You can help drink the milk.
00:50:55,00:50:56,If you're not living in the city.
00:50:56,00:50:57,"- I was thinking,"
00:50:57,00:50:59,"you're sitting there in your flat in the city,"
00:50:59,00:51:00,"third floor of your cow in your land,"
00:51:00,00:51:02,"and you go, ""What the fuck are we gonna do with this?"""
00:51:02,00:51:05,(laughing)
00:51:05,00:51:07,- Do you think that the naming ceremony
00:51:07,00:51:09,is based on a sort of human?
00:51:09,00:51:11,"Because there are lots of those around the world, right?"
00:51:11,00:51:12,"- Yeah, it is."
00:51:12,00:51:14,"It's big and Rwanda, giving the name,"
00:51:14,00:51:16,the name that you give someone determines their life.
00:51:16,00:51:19,"- They are born, they have their first cigar,"
00:51:19,00:51:21,"and then you have a big ceremony where you name them,"
00:51:21,00:51:23,"and all of the family members come along,"
00:51:23,00:51:25,"and some people suggest different names,"
00:51:25,00:51:27,"and then they decide which one they're gonna go with,"
00:51:27,00:51:28,and there's a big old party.
00:51:28,00:51:29,"- And it's usually Idris Elba,"
00:51:29,00:51:32,who it comes down to the decision in the end.
00:51:32,00:51:33,"He's a very busy man, but..."
00:51:33,00:51:36,- But the ancient Romans had one called
00:51:36,00:51:38,DA's illustrious of purification day.
00:51:38,00:51:41,That was what the naming ceremony was called.
00:51:41,00:51:43,"According to Plutarch,"
00:51:43,00:51:45,"until the baby had a name,"
00:51:45,00:51:46,"and the umbilical cord fell off,"
00:51:46,00:51:49,they were regarded as a plant rather than an animal.
00:51:49,00:51:50,- Really?
00:51:50,00:51:52,"- Yes, it was only when the umbilical cord fell off."
00:51:52,00:51:54,- I thought it was like a stalk?
00:51:54,00:51:55,"- Yeah, I guess you're rooted to something."
00:51:55,00:51:57,"- So this is the thing, I didn't know,"
00:51:57,00:52:00,I knew that from somewhere that ancient Roman women
00:52:00,00:52:02,"had very small choice of names,"
00:52:02,00:52:04,"but if you were called Claudius, for example,"
00:52:04,00:52:06,"you had a daughter, she'd be called Claudia."
00:52:06,00:52:08,You wouldn't have her own name.
00:52:08,00:52:09,"And if you had a second daughter,"
00:52:09,00:52:11,"she would be called Claudia Minor,"
00:52:11,00:52:13,and the first one would be called Claudia Major.
00:52:13,00:52:15,"If you had a third daughter,"
00:52:15,00:52:17,"she would just be called Claudius Tertia,"
00:52:17,00:52:18,"you know, Claudius III until..."
00:52:18,00:52:22,- I think Julius Caesar had like four sisters all called Julia.
00:52:22,00:52:23,"- Yes, really? - Really?"
00:52:23,00:52:24,- Yeah.
00:52:24,00:52:24,- Wow.
00:52:24,00:52:27,"In Hungary, there's a Hungarian naming day."
00:52:27,00:52:28,Have you heard of this?
00:52:28,00:52:31,So the idea is that a name is associated
00:52:31,00:52:32,"with one day of the year,"
00:52:32,00:52:34,and a lot of people will celebrate their name day
00:52:34,00:52:35,rather than actual birthday.
00:52:35,00:52:36,"- Oh yeah, I think that happens in a few years."
00:52:36,00:52:37,"- I think we've discussed that quite recently,"
00:52:37,00:52:39,haven't we? - Often the same day.
00:52:39,00:52:40,"- Oh, right."
00:52:40,00:52:42,"- It's all like Ghana, where they name kids"
00:52:42,00:52:44,after the day of the week.
00:52:44,00:52:44,"- Yeah, right."
00:52:44,00:52:47,"- So in Akan, for example, Kofi,"
00:52:47,00:52:50,as in Kofi Annan means born on Friday.
00:52:50,00:52:53,"And Quasi, as in Quasi Quateng means born on Sunday."
00:52:53,00:52:54,- Really?
00:52:54,00:52:57,"- And Liz, as in Liz Truss, means born yesterday."
00:52:57,00:53:00,- A bit of three-year-old satire there.
00:53:00,00:53:03,(upbeat music)
00:53:03,00:53:07,"- Okay, that's it."
00:53:07,00:53:08,That is all of our facts.
00:53:08,00:53:10,Thank you so much for listening.

00:53:19,00:53:20,"- John, you're on Instagram."
00:53:20,00:53:22,- I'm JohnloidQI.
00:53:22,00:53:23,- Nice.

00:53:24,00:53:26,"- Well, I really want to say my son, Harry,"
00:53:26,00:53:30,who you all know is an amazing band called Waiting for Smith.
00:53:30,00:53:33,And they've got a great new single coming out called
00:53:33,00:53:34,"I Got That Smiling For You,"
00:53:34,00:53:36,which I think is going to be his smash thing.
00:53:36,00:53:39,Waiting for Smith on Instagram or all the other platforms.
00:53:39,00:53:40,- Nice.
00:53:40,00:53:42,"And if you want to get to us as a group, Anna."

00:54:02,00:54:04,popping up every fortnight.
00:54:04,00:54:05,It's a really fun place.
00:54:05,00:54:06,Check it out.
00:54:06,00:54:07,"Otherwise, just come back here next week"

00:54:11,00:54:14,(upbeat music)
00:54:14,00:54:17,- Can you do some folio?
00:54:17,00:54:19,I'm just gonna walk over there.
00:54:19,00:54:20,- Yeah.
00:54:20,00:54:24,- That's offensive.
00:54:24,00:54:24,He's not that heavy.
00:54:24,00:54:29,- And I'm back.
00:54:29,00:54:31,I just went to the...
00:54:31,00:54:33,(laughing)
00:54:33,00:54:35,I just went to the bookcase
00:54:35,00:54:37,because staring me in the face
00:54:37,00:54:39,"is this book, ""The Adoles of London""."
00:54:39,00:54:42,- And it's by John Richardson.
00:54:42,00:54:43,Wow.
00:54:43,00:54:43,- Oh my God.
00:54:43,00:54:45,- It's by another John Richardson.
00:54:45,00:54:46,"- It's so good, isn't it?"
00:54:46,00:54:46,- What a coincidence.
00:54:46,00:54:47,- This guy's amazing.
00:54:47,00:54:48,- He's a polymath.
00:54:48,00:54:50,- How does he get time to do the...
00:54:50,00:54:52,(upbeat music)
00:54:52,00:54:55,(upbeat music)
00:54:55,00:54:57,(upbeat music)
