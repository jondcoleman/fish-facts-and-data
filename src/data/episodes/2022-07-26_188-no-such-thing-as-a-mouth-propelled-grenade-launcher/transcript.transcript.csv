00:00:02,00:00:04,[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
00:00:04,00:00:07,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:00:07,00:00:22,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of ""No Such Things"
00:00:22,00:00:25,"A Fish A Weekly Podcast"" coming to you this week"
00:00:25,00:00:27,from the stand in Newcastle!
00:00:27,00:00:32,[APPLAUSE]
00:00:32,00:00:35,"I am sitting here with Anne Chazinski, James Harkin,"
00:00:35,00:00:37,and Andrew Hunter Murray.
00:00:37,00:00:39,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:39,00:00:42,to share our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:42,00:00:44,And now it is time for fact number one.
00:00:44,00:00:47,And that is James.
00:00:47,00:00:52,"OK, my fact this week is that Mothara has only one Guinness"
00:00:52,00:00:54,world record.
00:00:54,00:00:56,And it is in the 100-metre sac race.
00:00:56,00:01:00,[LAUGHTER]
00:01:00,00:01:05,When did I score sports day here with that?
00:01:05,00:01:08,"I don't know why he did it, but he did it."
00:01:08,00:01:11,"I read an article, and it said, ""Mothara needs a world record"
00:01:11,00:01:14,"to seal his place among the old-time greats."""
00:01:14,00:01:18,"And I thought, I'll check if he has one, and he does."
00:01:18,00:01:21,"He has one other one, which is a two-mile indoor run,"
00:01:21,00:01:22,but that's not in the Guinness Book of Records.
00:01:22,00:01:25,"In the Guinness Book of Records, this is the only one."
00:01:25,00:01:28,And he's about to lose it.
00:01:28,00:01:29,"What, really?"
00:01:29,00:01:30,Yeah.
00:01:30,00:01:33,And there's a guy called Stephen Wildish from Rotten.
00:01:33,00:01:38,And Mothara got 39.91 seconds for his 100 meters.
00:01:38,00:01:43,"And Stephen Wildish has already got 28 seconds, OK?"
00:01:43,00:01:45,"But unfortunately, two weeks after he did it,"
00:01:45,00:01:47,he got a letter from Guinness saying
00:01:47,00:01:50,"that to get the world record, he needed a 50 kilogram sac."
00:01:50,00:01:53,And his sac was only 30 kilograms.
00:01:53,00:01:56,"I thought for a second, you meant the sac had to weigh 50 kilograms."
00:01:56,00:02:01,"And I am amazed, anyone finishes it."
00:02:01,00:02:04,"So anyway, I got in touch with Stephen Wildish."
00:02:04,00:02:08,And he's going to repeat his attempt next week.
00:02:08,00:02:11,And he's really confident that he's definitely going to do it.
00:02:11,00:02:15,"And so that means that by probably the week after this goes out,"
00:02:15,00:02:17,Mothara will have no Guinness World Records.
00:02:17,00:02:19,So we snuck in.
00:02:19,00:02:22,"Right, this definitely needs to go out this Friday, James."
00:02:22,00:02:25,What's the speed that he managed to clock in for the record?
00:02:25,00:02:28,So Stephen managed to do it at 28 seconds for the 100 meters.
00:02:28,00:02:32,"So a normal 100 meters form, who say Mothar would be just under 10 seconds."
00:02:32,00:02:34,"So yeah, you know, it's not that fast."
00:02:34,00:02:35,But it's quite fast.
00:02:35,00:02:36,And I asked him why.
00:02:36,00:02:41,I asked Stephen why he was so much better at the sac race than Mothara.
00:02:41,00:02:47,"And he says, unlike Mothar, I have little legs, but large calf muscles."
00:02:47,00:02:52,And I asked him if he has any inspirational words for the people of Newcastle.
00:02:52,00:02:59,"And he said, ""Inspirational words, always check your sac."""
00:02:59,00:03:01,Very good.
00:03:01,00:03:01,A wise man.
00:03:01,00:03:06,"So Mothara, you're saying, has the Guinness World Record for the sac race,"
00:03:06,00:03:09,but he also has-- but he does have a world record.
00:03:09,00:03:12,"He just has one other world record, but it's not a special Guinness one."
00:03:12,00:03:15,It's just like a-- just the IWAF or something.
00:03:15,00:03:17,"Yeah, but it's a world record."
00:03:17,00:03:21,"I don't think like when you say bowl gets an Olympic world record, they're going,"
00:03:21,00:03:24,"""Yeah, that's not Guinness World Record, isn't it?"""
00:03:24,00:03:25,"Surely, that's more."
00:03:25,00:03:26,"I see what you mean, but it is."
00:03:26,00:03:29,"I mean, it's the two-mile indoor run."
00:03:29,00:03:34,"Yeah, I mean, I'm not putting him down, but why is that many different than an outdoor run?"
00:03:34,00:03:37,"It's more impressive really to have a two-mile long building, frankly."
00:03:37,00:03:44,It's true.
00:03:44,00:03:47,"It's weird though, because on the Guinness Record page for running records,"
00:03:47,00:03:50,"they've really bumped him up, haven't they?"
00:03:50,00:03:51,He's in the top four.
00:03:51,00:03:53,"I think he's fourth one down, it's the sac race."
00:03:53,00:03:58,"So number one is fastest male marathon, number two is fastest female,"
00:03:58,00:04:00,"number three is first to get three records at the Olympics,"
00:04:00,00:04:03,"and number four is sneaks, and then with the sac race."
00:04:03,00:04:06,"And I don't want to put down Guinness Book of Records,"
00:04:06,00:04:09,"but when they said that Stephen Wildish's sac was too small,"
00:04:09,00:04:13,I kind of think they're a bit upset about Mothara losing this record.
00:04:13,00:04:14,Yeah.
00:04:14,00:04:17,"They didn't know, but they do have rules about how big the sac is."
00:04:17,00:04:18,They actually do.
00:04:18,00:04:22,"They have one thing, which is if the sac is too big,"
00:04:22,00:04:26,they notice that people as opposed to like 100 meters long for it to sink.
00:04:26,00:04:27,Yeah.
00:04:27,00:04:35,"But that's the main issue, really, because obviously in a sac race,"
00:04:35,00:04:36,you're hopping everywhere.
00:04:36,00:04:40,"If you have a slightly larger sac, people actually run inside the sac"
00:04:40,00:04:43,"in order to get there, and that builds up speed in a way."
00:04:43,00:04:46,"You can kind of run, you can put your feet into little corners"
00:04:46,00:04:48,and do a little kind of wiggly run.
00:04:48,00:04:52,"But the thing is, it used to be in the 19th century in America"
00:04:52,00:04:55,"that each college would have their athletics team,"
00:04:55,00:04:58,so they'd have a javelin thrower and a 100 meters runner.
00:04:58,00:05:01,But they would all also have a sac race guy.
00:05:01,00:05:03,"And this was quite a big deal, and they would train,"
00:05:03,00:05:06,and they would really try and be awesome at the sac race.
00:05:06,00:05:09,"And some of them would hop, and some of them would run with the feet in the corners."
00:05:09,00:05:11,And the hoppers were usually better.
00:05:11,00:05:15,And the thing is that they came up with a technique of really hopping
00:05:15,00:05:17,as far as they could.
00:05:17,00:05:19,And it was quite ungainly.
00:05:19,00:05:21,And sometimes they'd fall over.
00:05:21,00:05:21,OK.
00:05:21,00:05:24,"But they were so good that when they fell over,"
00:05:24,00:05:27,they sort of did a little somersault and could get back on their feet immediately.
00:05:27,00:05:30,And they virtually lost no time whatsoever.
00:05:30,00:05:31,"Oh, wow."
00:05:31,00:05:33,And he's anal thing that he was talking about earlier.
00:05:33,00:05:35,Sorry.
00:05:35,00:05:39,"So for the people listening to this podcast on Friday,"
00:05:39,00:05:43,and I would hope you'd edit this bit right out.
00:05:43,00:05:44,"No, I don't have a chance."
00:05:44,00:05:50,There's a new robot.
00:05:50,00:05:53,"We don't have time for this, we don't have time."
00:05:53,00:05:55,"No, we don't have time, no, no."
00:05:55,00:05:58,People can just imagine what you were thinking about.
00:05:58,00:06:00,OK.
00:06:00,00:06:03,Do you know there's a 100 meters on all fours world record?
00:06:03,00:06:05,Is there?
00:06:05,00:06:07,And it's 15.71 seconds.
00:06:07,00:06:08,That's fast.
00:06:08,00:06:09,Really?
00:06:09,00:06:10,They are unbelievably fast.
00:06:10,00:06:12,"The guys who do it, it's so good."
00:06:12,00:06:17,So it's the same man who's broken the record four times since 2008.
00:06:17,00:06:18,He's a Japanese guy.
00:06:18,00:06:26,"And to practice, he mops flaws on all fours, which is fun to say, as well as to do."
00:06:26,00:06:28,How does that help him practice?
00:06:28,00:06:32,I think he just gets habituated to being on all fours all the time and moving around.
00:06:32,00:06:33,And he's less likely.
00:06:33,00:06:37,But it's misrepresentative of the actual purchase you can get on the ground.
00:06:37,00:06:39,That would be more useful if he was ice skating.
00:06:39,00:06:41,Because then you have the slip of a...
00:06:41,00:06:43,"It's like training, get altitude, isn't it?"
00:06:43,00:06:46,Because if you can do it on a slippy floor and then you get on a proper road.
00:06:46,00:06:47,Yeah.
00:06:47,00:06:48,He's not wrong.
00:06:48,00:06:49,"Yeah, he's right."
00:06:49,00:06:50,He's right.
00:06:50,00:06:54,"These stupid sports, like sports day sports, used to be more difficult."
00:06:54,00:06:55,Stupid sports.
00:06:55,00:06:57,"You know, sports that are for the people who aren't sporty at sports day."
00:06:57,00:07:01,We've all got a list and I had pole vaults on mine.
00:07:01,00:07:02,Pole vaults are stupid sports.
00:07:02,00:07:03,Stupid sport.
00:07:03,00:07:07,"I'm thinking more egg and spoon, the three-legged, all that kind of stuff."
00:07:07,00:07:11,But I was looking them up in the British newspaper archive to see what people used to do
00:07:11,00:07:12,in the olden days about them.
00:07:12,00:07:17,"And it turns out that the egg and spoon race, for instance, used to be done while punting."
00:07:17,00:07:20,So there was a reference.
00:07:20,00:07:24,"This is, in fact, this is the earliest usage in the OED of egg and spoon."
00:07:24,00:07:29,It's an 1894 and it said the gentleman had a turn in the egg and spoon race
00:07:29,00:07:34,in which competitors had to punt with one hand and balance an egg and spoon with another.
00:07:34,00:07:36,"So that is actually much harder, you know, punting for people who aren't"
00:07:36,00:07:40,from Oxford or Cambridge is where you are on a boat standing up and you drop a stick in
00:07:40,00:07:42,and you have to power your boat along.
00:07:42,00:07:44,"At the same time, it's carrying an egg and spoon."
00:07:44,00:07:45,Wow.
00:07:45,00:07:48,I thought you meant punting us and putting a bet on with the horses.
00:07:48,00:07:52,"No, no, that was strictly forbidden, actually."
00:07:52,00:07:54,And the wheelbarrow race was blindfolded.
00:07:54,00:07:58,"This was in the 19th century at, for instance, a cubic blindfolded."
00:07:58,00:08:01,And wheelbarrows don't have eyes.
00:08:01,00:08:02,Exactly.
00:08:02,00:08:05,It's just more realistic.
00:08:05,00:08:06,I think you're both blindfolded.
00:08:06,00:08:10,"So this is for Queen Victoria's Jubilee, there was a huge wheelbarrow race."
00:08:10,00:08:11,And she didn't participate.
00:08:11,00:08:12,"Sorry, the wheelbarrow."
00:08:12,00:08:16,"Are we talking, we're talking where you're carrying someone's legs and they're moving"
00:08:16,00:08:17,on their hands.
00:08:17,00:08:19,"Not a wheelbarrow, wheelbarrow."
00:08:19,00:08:23,"No, no, where there are two people, one of them is pretending to be a wheelbarrow."
00:08:23,00:08:24,Yeah.
00:08:24,00:08:27,"Yeah, you have to be blindfolded, which makes it a lot more difficult."
00:08:27,00:08:28,That's you.
00:08:28,00:08:29,That's nuts.
00:08:29,00:08:32,"Hey, you know that Mofara does the mobot?"
00:08:32,00:08:33,"Oh, yeah."
00:08:33,00:08:37,It turns out that he's actually being the M from YMCA.
00:08:37,00:08:43,"I said, are you saying that's where he came up with it or just, no, they came, so he does"
00:08:43,00:08:44,that thing.
00:08:44,00:08:45,He does his mobot.
00:08:45,00:08:51,"And the inspiration from that was he was on a TV show, Claire Bolding and James Corden were"
00:08:51,00:08:53,trying to work out what he should do to celebrate the win.
00:08:53,00:08:55,And Claire Bolding was the one who invented it.
00:08:55,00:09:00,"James Corden called it the mobot, but she said it's the M from YMCA."
00:09:00,00:09:04,"If you had someone who'd just done a vault in the gymnastics, stood next to him, you only"
00:09:04,00:09:07,need a C and an A and you've got the whole thing.
00:09:07,00:09:11,"But wait, that's not, it stands for the M of his name."
00:09:11,00:09:15,I think Claire Bolding was just trying to explain what it looked like to people if they weren't
00:09:15,00:09:16,"watching the TV, right?"
00:09:16,00:09:20,He doesn't do it as a tribute to the YMCA.
00:09:20,00:09:21,I don't think.
00:09:21,00:09:23,"No, he's plagiarised."
00:09:23,00:09:27,"One of the greatest dancers, Mr Farah's lawyers and listening to big claim, it's not"
00:09:27,00:09:30,one we all support on this show.
00:09:30,00:09:34,"Do you know something Mo Farah did do, which is not that cool, actually."
00:09:34,00:09:39,He has a fellow runner called Chris Thompson and they're good friends in Chris Thompson won
00:09:39,00:09:43,"Silver Medal in Barcelona when Mo won gold a few years ago, I don't know why I'm calling"
00:09:43,00:09:47,"him Mo, I don't know him, when Mo Farah won gold a few years ago."
00:09:47,00:09:52,"But the first time they ran a race together, Mo Farah said was encouraging him and said,"
00:09:52,00:09:56,"""How about we'll run this race, we're going to win it, we'll both run it, we'll hold"
00:09:56,00:10:00,"hands as we run, and then we can cross the finish line at the same time."""
00:10:00,00:10:04,"They did it and they held hands for the full race and then with 10 metres to go, Mo Farah"
00:10:04,00:10:09,"let go of him, push it aside and sprint to the end of the race."
00:10:09,00:10:15,"The 100 metre record for Egon Spoon Race is, do you think it's more or less than Stephen"
00:10:15,00:10:16,Wildish's?
00:10:16,00:10:17,28 seconds.
00:10:17,00:10:18,28 seconds.
00:10:18,00:10:19,Okay.
00:10:19,00:10:20,Quicker Rosloas.
00:10:20,00:10:21,Quicker.
00:10:21,00:10:22,It is quicker.
00:10:22,00:10:31,"Yeah, it's 16.59 seconds but it was set by Sally Pearson who is a professional 100 metre runner"
00:10:31,00:10:37,or she's a herdler but she's quite famous and she beat a guy called Asherita Firman who
00:10:37,00:10:39,"you guys might recognise, we've mentioned him before."
00:10:39,00:10:45,"He has more than 100 world records, mostly in what Anna might call the stupid spots."
00:10:45,00:10:49,Triple jump.
00:10:49,00:10:52,I got loads.
00:10:52,00:10:55,I can't think of many non-stupid spots.
00:10:55,00:11:00,Well I reckon he must have been pretty annoyed to have lost his 100 metre Egon Spoon Race because
00:11:00,00:11:07,the very next month he then broke the 100 metres carrying an Egon Spoon in the mouth record.
00:11:07,00:11:08,Wow.
00:11:08,00:11:11,Do you even know that was a sport?
00:11:11,00:11:14,I suspect it probably wasn't.
00:11:14,00:11:18,Do you know that the school sport stays a regular feature of the me used to be the pillow fight?
00:11:18,00:11:22,Now that's a sport.
00:11:22,00:11:23,How do you win the pillow fight?
00:11:23,00:11:24,I don't know.
00:11:24,00:11:25,It didn't actually say.
00:11:25,00:11:26,I'm sorry where there's article were.
00:11:26,00:11:27,The winner was just announced.
00:11:27,00:11:29,We used to play in Australia for sports.
00:11:29,00:11:34,You would sit on a big wooden pole and you'd each have a pillow and you'd try and whack
00:11:34,00:11:37,each other off.
00:11:37,00:11:40,Sorry.
00:11:40,00:11:44,I wasn't the way you had such a traditional education then.
00:11:44,00:11:48,"OK, it's time for fact number two."
00:11:48,00:11:49,And that is Andy.
00:11:49,00:11:56,My fact is that the inside of a Kit Kat is made of more Kit Kat's.
00:11:56,00:12:00,Kit Kat's are an infinite recursive loop is what I'm trying to say.
00:12:00,00:12:01,This is so cool.
00:12:01,00:12:03,"I mean it can't be true, right?"
00:12:03,00:12:06,Because where did the first Kit Kat insides come from?
00:12:06,00:12:08,Nobody knows.
00:12:08,00:12:11,"Yeah, this is like a chicken and egg situation isn't it?"
00:12:11,00:12:12,"It kind of, yeah."
00:12:12,00:12:15,So except the eggs are not made of mashed up.
00:12:15,00:12:19,Chickens.
00:12:19,00:12:24,"Yeah, it's kind of, it's kind of like that."
00:12:24,00:12:28,So basically during the production process of Kit Kat some of them don't meet the very strict
00:12:28,00:12:34,"criteria for a proper Kit Kat, you know, the wrong shape or they got too many fingers."
00:12:34,00:12:36,I don't know.
00:12:36,00:12:43,"But anyway, they're wrong and they are, they're rejected and they are ground up and they are"
00:12:43,00:12:48,the filling layer between the wafer bits in a Kit Kat is made of those plus a couple of
00:12:48,00:12:51,"other things as well, more sugar."
00:12:51,00:12:53,"So yeah, they sit the headlines earlier this year."
00:12:53,00:12:54,I'd never hit the headlines.
00:12:54,00:12:58,"Sure, it was a slow news day, wasn't it?"
00:12:58,00:13:02,"I'd never noticed until you said this fact I looked into it, there was a layer between the"
00:13:02,00:13:03,wafer and a Kit Kat.
00:13:03,00:13:05,I just thought it was chocolate around the outside and wafer on the inside.
00:13:05,00:13:08,Sometimes you get one which is all chocolate.
00:13:08,00:13:09,Wow.
00:13:09,00:13:10,Wow.
00:13:10,00:13:11,It's a good day that I say when you go.
00:13:11,00:13:12,Have you had one of those?
00:13:12,00:13:13,"Oh, yeah."
00:13:13,00:13:14,Has anyone else?
00:13:14,00:13:15,Yeah.
00:13:15,00:13:17,"About half the rum, okay."
00:13:17,00:13:18,Good.
00:13:18,00:13:19,Wow.
00:13:19,00:13:20,Okay.
00:13:20,00:13:25,"You really, honestly, Andy, wait till it happens to you, it's a real life changer."
00:13:25,00:13:32,"But Kit Kat's, I only realise looking into this, what they mean in Japan, which is a lot."
00:13:32,00:13:33,Everything.
00:13:33,00:13:34,What do you mean?
00:13:34,00:13:35,Everything.
00:13:35,00:13:38,So Japanese people just love Kit Kat's and they've gone way more nuts than we have.
00:13:38,00:13:44,"So apparently, Kit Katzu is a Japanese expression that means surely win, so it basically means"
00:13:44,00:13:45,good luck.
00:13:45,00:13:49,"And so because of this coincidence, they're super popular in Japan and they've got loads"
00:13:49,00:13:50,of flavours.
00:13:50,00:13:54,So they've got more than 300 different Kit Kat flavours in Japan.
00:13:54,00:13:58,"Nestily, they've just built a factory there specifically to make the weird-ass flavours"
00:13:58,00:13:59,that they have.
00:13:59,00:14:04,"So they have wasabi flavoured Kit Kat, they have soy sauce flavour, they have sushi flavoured"
00:14:04,00:14:05,Kit Kat.
00:14:05,00:14:07,"What do you guys, you haven't tried it?"
00:14:07,00:14:08,That's right.
00:14:08,00:14:09,They're not going to enjoy it.
00:14:09,00:14:14,"They have, in Japan, made a Kit Kat which doubles up as a postcard and you can just put it"
00:14:14,00:14:19,in the post to someone because every year about half the children doing their exams get sent
00:14:19,00:14:22,a Kit Kat for good luck because of that surely win thing.
00:14:22,00:14:26,"So Kit Kat invented a one that's a postcard and you can just send it to someone, just put"
00:14:26,00:14:31,"a Kit Kat into the letterbox, you did it, you'd be arrested."
00:14:31,00:14:36,We're only one envelope away from that.
00:14:36,00:14:43,"Yeah, but you know that Kit Kat started out as Mutton Pies."
00:14:43,00:14:46,This is true.
00:14:46,00:14:57,"So there was a club in London called the Kit Kat Club and it was, it was run by an innkeeper"
00:14:57,00:15:02,"called Christopher Kat, who was called Kit Kat and every, all the literary figures of"
00:15:02,00:15:07,time used to go there and he would serve them Mutton Pies which they called a Kit Kat.
00:15:07,00:15:13,And so the idea is that that just became a name of a popular food source and then eventually
00:15:13,00:15:14,it turned into Kit Kat.
00:15:14,00:15:22,"No one has acknowledged that this is true, but the Kit Kat Club, the Kit Kat Club is definitely"
00:15:22,00:15:23,true.
00:15:23,00:15:24,It's definitely true.
00:15:24,00:15:25,It's association as well.
00:15:25,00:15:26,"Yeah, yeah."
00:15:26,00:15:29,"So the original Kit Kat definitely was Mutton Pies but get this, the ceilings were so low"
00:15:29,00:15:33,in the Kit Kat Club that they were beautiful establishments.
00:15:33,00:15:37,"So what they, what they did was have paintings all over the club but because the ceilings"
00:15:37,00:15:43,"were so low, they needed to get paintings that were longer on the, well on landscape rather"
00:15:43,00:15:45,than portrait.
00:15:45,00:15:50,And there's a theory that the reason that Kit Kat so shaped like they are is because they're
00:15:50,00:15:54,paying tribute to the squatty paintings of the Kit Kat Club in London.
00:15:54,00:15:58,"Sorry, I didn't realise when he said no one's acknowledge this is true, you were talking"
00:15:58,00:16:04,about the thing you were about to say.
00:16:04,00:16:06,You know the Kit Kat slogan?
00:16:06,00:16:07,I have a break.
00:16:07,00:16:08,Have a break.
00:16:08,00:16:09,Have a break.
00:16:09,00:16:10,I only got that yesterday.
00:16:10,00:16:11,That's a pun.
00:16:11,00:16:17,I didn't realise it was a reference to Kit Kat's breaking.
00:16:17,00:16:19,"I thought it was just like, you know, yeah, a break or what?"
00:16:19,00:16:20,I didn't get the other meaning.
00:16:20,00:16:21,And they only called that.
00:16:21,00:16:22,Did everyone get that?
00:16:22,00:16:23,"No, no, no."
00:16:23,00:16:24,No.
00:16:24,00:16:25,Of course everyone fucking got it.
00:16:25,00:16:34,As far as if the slogan writer's going to be at a time going finally.
00:16:34,00:16:35,Was it too obtuse?
00:16:35,00:16:36,What was I doing that was wrong?
00:16:36,00:16:39,"Sorry, can I join Anna's Club of people who didn't get it?"
00:16:39,00:16:40,"Sorry, sorry."
00:16:40,00:16:46,"In the, in the advert, they break it, as they say, have a break."
00:16:46,00:16:48,"I didn't, I know."
00:16:48,00:16:50,"I know, I know."
00:16:50,00:16:51,"We know all the clues were there, James."
00:16:51,00:16:52,Some sort of two things.
00:16:52,00:16:56,And it only came about in the 50s when they toughened up the materials that they made Kit Kat's
00:16:56,00:17:00,"from, and they were very proud of the new snapping sound that it made."
00:17:00,00:17:03,And so actually the crucial thing about it is the breaking sound.
00:17:03,00:17:09,Look who suddenly the expert on the etymology and the standing of the slogan.
00:17:09,00:17:11,I have a fact about chocolate.
00:17:11,00:17:12,OK.
00:17:12,00:17:16,"The average chocolate bar is about 20 to 25% fat, 40 to 50% sugar, right?"
00:17:16,00:17:18,"So it's one gram of fat to two grams of sugar, right?"
00:17:18,00:17:19,OK.
00:17:19,00:17:24,It's very unusual in nature to find those ratios of sugar and fat together.
00:17:24,00:17:27,"So if you have nuts, they have lots of fat, but no sugar."
00:17:27,00:17:31,"If you have fruit, loads of sugar, but no fat, there is a theory that the reason we like"
00:17:31,00:17:37,"chocolate is because the place you find that same ratio, one gram fat, two gram of sugar,"
00:17:37,00:17:38,is breast milk.
00:17:38,00:17:39,Oh.
00:17:39,00:17:40,No way.
00:17:40,00:17:43,"Yeah, 4% fat, 8% sugar."
00:17:43,00:17:45,So it may be that we are trying to recreate.
00:17:45,00:17:46,No.
00:17:46,00:17:48,No.
00:17:48,00:17:50,Are earliest.
00:17:50,00:17:51,Yeah.
00:17:51,00:17:53,Come for food.
00:17:53,00:17:54,That's what's happening.
00:17:54,00:17:59,Why do you think the Terry's chocolate orange is so successful?
00:17:59,00:18:00,I don't know.
00:18:00,00:18:01,Why?
00:18:01,00:18:10,"Because you were breastfed by an umpa-lumpa, and you're trying to get back to that."
00:18:10,00:18:11,"Wait, don't."
00:18:11,00:18:13,The Terry's chocolate orange isn't orange.
00:18:13,00:18:15,You know you have to take the wrapping off.
00:18:15,00:18:18,I found a really cool thing.
00:18:18,00:18:23,"I was looking into how they test chocolate, and it led me down a little road that got me"
00:18:23,00:18:28,"to MacVitties and all sorts of just how they, they, for candies and biscuits and chocolate"
00:18:28,00:18:29,biscuits and stuff.
00:18:29,00:18:36,"And um, there's a dummy that tests crumb uh, looseage once you're biting into it."
00:18:36,00:18:40,"So it's a robot dummy that just bites, got plastic teeth."
00:18:40,00:18:45,"It's called a crumb test dummy, and the idea is that MacVitties have a laboratory where"
00:18:45,00:18:52,they put it into its mouth and it just goes up and the advantage is that it never stops
00:18:52,00:18:56,"doing that because it doesn't need to breathe because Andy, what is it?"
00:18:56,00:18:57,The robot.
00:18:57,00:18:58,Yes.
00:18:58,00:19:02,It's a bit like the anal thing you were talking about.
00:19:02,00:19:04,No.
00:19:04,00:19:06,Do we need to move on to the next fact?
00:19:06,00:19:07,"Yeah, we do actually."
00:19:07,00:19:13,"We do need to move on to the next fact, um, sorry Andy to cut you off again, try to get"
00:19:13,00:19:15,to it before the end of the show.
00:19:15,00:19:19,"Um, and now it is time for fact number three and that is Chazinski."
00:19:19,00:19:25,"Yeah, my fact this week is that the first hamsters to come to the UK arrived in a coat pocket."
00:19:25,00:19:26,Oh.
00:19:26,00:19:27,I know.
00:19:27,00:19:28,So sweet.
00:19:28,00:19:34,The story of hamsters is really interesting.
00:19:34,00:19:41,"So um, basically there was a scientist called, don't be skeptical, there was a scientist"
00:19:41,00:19:46,"called Saul Adler back in the 1920s, 1930s and he decided that hamsters would be similar,"
00:19:46,00:19:51,were similar enough to humans that they might serve as useful lab animals for obvious reasons
00:19:51,00:19:54,"that I don't need to go into hamsters humans, basically the same."
00:19:54,00:19:59,"Um, and he, no, he specifically wanted to try out stuff that might cure parasitic diseases"
00:19:59,00:20:00,on them.
00:20:00,00:20:04,And so he brought three hamsters back from Syria in 1931.
00:20:04,00:20:09,So all the pet hamsters that you have had in your childhoods and that you've ever seen
00:20:09,00:20:14,"are all descended, um, from the, this tiny batch of Syrian hamsters that these guys found"
00:20:14,00:20:16,in the 1930s.
00:20:16,00:20:19,"And yeah, he smuggled these guys back in his coat pocket."
00:20:19,00:20:23,"And didn't he smuggle them, I might be thinking of a different person, but didn't he smuggle"
00:20:23,00:20:27,them back in the coat pocket because they ate their way out of the box that they were
00:20:27,00:20:28,in?
00:20:28,00:20:29,Yes.
00:20:29,00:20:30,It's a really exciting story.
00:20:30,00:20:31,Yeah.
00:20:31,00:20:32,Yeah.
00:20:32,00:20:33,It is.
00:20:33,00:20:36,"No, they got, they got a dozen, didn't they just start?"
00:20:36,00:20:37,Yeah.
00:20:37,00:20:41,"And then the mother started, the mother killed one of the babies, so then they had 10 less."
00:20:41,00:20:42,"Okay, fine."
00:20:42,00:20:44,And then half of them escaped and had to be recaptured.
00:20:44,00:20:48,And then they put them in a wooden box and they chewed through that and then were recaptured.
00:20:48,00:20:50,"It's like the great escape, but with hamsters."
00:20:50,00:20:55,"And that was with, the guy was called Israel Aheroni, wasn't he?"
00:20:55,00:20:58,"Who, he was the guy who was determined that he'd get these hamsters."
00:20:58,00:21:00,And it sounds like his life depended on it.
00:21:00,00:21:04,"Um, when, when these five escaped, he was absolutely devastated."
00:21:04,00:21:06,He said he was shaken to his depths.
00:21:06,00:21:11,"And imagine, yeah, when the mother ate her children and then he had three left and then I think,"
00:21:11,00:21:14,"uh, oh no, yeah, one, one sibling ate another."
00:21:14,00:21:17,"And then he had to make the brother and sister, didn't he, that was nice."
00:21:17,00:21:18,Yes.
00:21:18,00:21:19,So they're all products of incest?
00:21:19,00:21:20,No.
00:21:20,00:21:21,No.
00:21:21,00:21:22,All your childhood hamsters?
00:21:22,00:21:23,Yeah.
00:21:23,00:21:24,Incest.
00:21:24,00:21:28,"That's actually one of, that's one of the reasons they're so useful, uh, because they're"
00:21:28,00:21:32,similarity to humans is genuinely because they're very susceptible to heart disease
00:21:32,00:21:36,"hamsters, um, as susceptible as humans and also that's why they're quite good to study."
00:21:36,00:21:38,And the reason they're susceptible is because they're all very imbred.
00:21:38,00:21:39,Really?
00:21:39,00:21:40,"Yeah, apparently so."
00:21:40,00:21:41,Wow.
00:21:41,00:21:47,"The thing is about, um, hamsters is it's really weird why they become popular pets really because"
00:21:47,00:21:50,they only live for a couple of years.
00:21:50,00:21:51,Tick?
00:21:51,00:21:52,Yeah.
00:21:52,00:21:53,[laughter]
00:21:53,00:21:57,"That is a certain comfort, James, in knowing this is a short-term contract."
00:21:57,00:21:58,Yeah.
00:21:58,00:22:04,"Well, they don't like being handled, you know, they're nocturnal."
00:22:04,00:22:06,"Oh, during the day they don't do anything."
00:22:06,00:22:07,Are they nocturnal?
00:22:07,00:22:10,"I read that they, well, in the wild, they're definitely nocturnal."
00:22:10,00:22:13,Both of mine as a child were nocturnal.
00:22:13,00:22:15,"They just don't want to hang out with you, man."
00:22:15,00:22:16,[laughter]
00:22:16,00:22:17,I read as well that they're...
00:22:17,00:22:20,It's because I get pointed at them and saying incest.
00:22:20,00:22:21,[laughter]
00:22:21,00:22:22,You should be ashamed.
00:22:22,00:22:23,Yeah.
00:22:23,00:22:24,"Clocks, ticking boys."
00:22:24,00:22:25,[laughter]
00:22:25,00:22:26,You have two months left.
00:22:26,00:22:28,I've had mobile phone contracts longer than you.
00:22:28,00:22:30,[laughter]
00:22:30,00:22:37,I've heard that you can...that they are able to drink alcohol because they hold...they
00:22:37,00:22:39,hold things...what is it?
00:22:39,00:22:43,"They hold stuff in their cheeks for so long and then they hoard them, and they don't eat"
00:22:43,00:22:47,"them too much later, but then it ferments and it turns into alcohol, so they've had to turn"
00:22:47,00:22:52,"their digestive system into one that can just downboose really quickly and not die, which"
00:22:52,00:22:55,"a lot of animals can't do, and these are serum on from Newcastle, basically."
00:22:55,00:22:56,[laughter]
00:22:56,00:23:00,Risky.
00:23:00,00:23:01,"The pouches are amazing, though."
00:23:01,00:23:04,They're cheeks stretch back to their hips when they need them too.
00:23:04,00:23:05,What?
00:23:05,00:23:08,"Yeah, they basically go and run down the whole length of their body, and they switch off"
00:23:08,00:23:13,their saliva glands to stop themselves accidentally metabolising the food that they want
00:23:13,00:23:17,"to store, so they stop making saliva until they feel hungry and then they start making"
00:23:17,00:23:18,again.
00:23:18,00:23:22,I read one thing that said that they can put enough stuff in their cheeks that will make
00:23:22,00:23:24,their heads triple in size.
00:23:24,00:23:25,[laughter]
00:23:25,00:23:26,What?
00:23:26,00:23:31,"Well, I looked at the size of the hamsters head and did a bit of working out, and basically"
00:23:31,00:23:36,it's the equivalent of me fitting a large tin of paint in my mouth.
00:23:36,00:23:37,[laughter]
00:23:37,00:23:41,"And ladies and gentlemen, we're off finale tonight."
00:23:41,00:23:42,[laughter]
00:23:42,00:23:49,"I think that's why they were called saddlebags, right, so when they first went to Syria to find"
00:23:49,00:23:53,"them, they realised the Arabic word for them, translated as Mr. saddlebags, so they called"
00:23:53,00:23:54,hamsters.
00:23:54,00:23:56,"Well, I'm not sure why, but I assume that must be it."
00:23:56,00:23:57,I think that is it.
00:23:57,00:23:58,Yeah.
00:23:58,00:24:00,Have you heard of America's Hamster King?
00:24:00,00:24:01,No.
00:24:01,00:24:02,He's a great guy.
00:24:02,00:24:06,He's the guy who popularised the hamster across the whole of the USA.
00:24:06,00:24:10,"He's a guy from Mobile, Alabama, and his name was Albert F. Marsh."
00:24:10,00:24:17,"And so I think in the early 50s, but I might be wrong, might be 40s, he took one hamster"
00:24:17,00:24:20,on as a payment of a $1 gambling debt.
00:24:20,00:24:22,That was how the debt to him was paid off in a hamster.
00:24:22,00:24:23,Right.
00:24:23,00:24:28,He must have got another one from somewhere because he then breathed them.
00:24:28,00:24:33,"But within three years, he was making the equivalent of $1.8 million a year, just from sending"
00:24:33,00:24:37,"hamsters out to people, and the way he built this business, it was a huge business."
00:24:37,00:24:39,He can't have been making that much money.
00:24:39,00:24:40,How much was he charging this time?
00:24:40,00:24:41,He made him...
00:24:41,00:24:46,"I think he charged about $9, no, it's about $9, which would have been a lot more then."
00:24:46,00:24:47,But this is incredible.
00:24:47,00:24:51,"So he built the business up and he made it absolutely massive really quickly, and his"
00:24:51,00:24:56,shipping method was to send a hamster to the address you wanted it sent to in a coffee
00:24:56,00:24:58,can with a potato.
00:24:58,00:25:04,"The potato was for it to eat and drink along the way, and it would arrive, and you would"
00:25:04,00:25:07,have a hamster and then no potato in a coffee tin.
00:25:07,00:25:16,"That is worse than Ryanair food, I've got to say, one potato, come on."
00:25:16,00:25:23,"I was reading that, so the idea of him bringing these bunch of hamsters in his coat pocket,"
00:25:23,00:25:26,I suddenly thought that's the idea of smuggling things in.
00:25:26,00:25:31,"I think I slightly misread the fact thinking it was smuggling in, but so I looked up smuggling,"
00:25:31,00:25:34,and that's where we're going now.
00:25:34,00:25:37,"But I was a story that happened just this year, and I'm so upset that it's not made it"
00:25:37,00:25:41,"into the book, because it would have been perfect."
00:25:41,00:25:47,A woman was arrested in Venezuela after several guards caught her trying to break her boyfriend
00:25:47,00:25:53,out of jail by smuggling him out in the suitcase that she brought in with her.
00:25:53,00:25:56,"So she went in with her daughter, and she just had, ""Oh, I've just got my suitcase with"
00:25:56,00:25:57,"me."""
00:25:57,00:26:01,"During the visit, while the guards were away, she opened it up, he got inside, they zipped"
00:26:01,00:26:05,"him up, and then she tried to just walk out again with him, and she got quite far, but"
00:26:05,00:26:10,"then she started struggling with the suitcase, and so they laid it down and they opened it"
00:26:10,00:26:17,"up, and inside was a squished boyfriend, who, yeah, that is not the only person in suitcase"
00:26:17,00:26:20,"crime story that has come from this year, from this year."
00:26:20,00:26:21,"No, yes."
00:26:21,00:26:27,"In the last week, there was a guy, I think in India, who was arrested, because he had been"
00:26:27,00:26:33,"committed crime by getting himself loaded into luggage holds in a bag, and then he would"
00:26:33,00:26:38,"get out of the bag, rob all the other bags in the luggage hold, and then get back into"
00:26:38,00:26:39,his bag.
00:26:39,00:26:40,"Oh, yes."
00:26:40,00:26:44,"Wait, how could he put everything in his bag with him?"
00:26:44,00:26:46,"I think he might have, he might have just left at that point."
00:26:46,00:26:47,No.
00:26:47,00:26:51,"Well, he might have just stolen small things, but imagine on that carousel, if you accidentally"
00:26:51,00:26:55,"pick up the wrong bag, there's a small Indian man."
00:26:55,00:26:56,Is this mine?
00:26:56,00:26:58,"No, that's not mine."
00:26:58,00:27:01,"All right, let's move on to our final fact."
00:27:01,00:27:05,"Okay, it's time for a final fact of the show, and that is my fact."
00:27:05,00:27:10,My fact this week is that an effective way to treat snoring is to regularly play the
00:27:10,00:27:13,didgeridoo.
00:27:13,00:27:14,This has been done.
00:27:14,00:27:16,It's been proven by scientists to work.
00:27:16,00:27:18,"No, listen, owing for the partner, is it?"
00:27:18,00:27:21,"When you come home, you're like, darling, I've got fantastic news."
00:27:21,00:27:22,I found a cure.
00:27:22,00:27:26,I'm just going to constantly play the didgeridoo for the rest of our lives.
00:27:26,00:27:29,"Instead of sleeping, I will be in bed next to you, playing the didgeridoo."
00:27:29,00:27:31,You won't even notice any snoring.
00:27:31,00:27:37,"Yeah, they did this as a test, they had 25 patients who all suffer from chronic snoring."
00:27:37,00:27:42,"They're 18 years old onwards, so they usually snoring affects people much older, but they"
00:27:42,00:27:45,wanted to start a younger age.
00:27:45,00:27:49,And they had the more practice a didgeridoo for 5.9 days a per week.
00:27:49,00:27:55,"That's how it worked out, for 25.3 minutes per session."
00:27:55,00:28:01,And they found a remarkable recovery process of the nasal passage for when you're sleeping
00:28:01,00:28:05,that you no longer were snoring either as intensely or at all.
00:28:05,00:28:10,"So if anyone here in the audience is a snorer, get yourself to Australia."
00:28:10,00:28:14,"It's a bit expensive, that's where they sell them, and yeah, start playing."
00:28:14,00:28:17,So I found out about this a few years ago.
00:28:17,00:28:21,"I went on to the QI forums, which is where we do the research for the TV show, and I look"
00:28:21,00:28:25,"for didgeridoo, and it turns out I'd post about this in 2006, which is when the report came"
00:28:25,00:28:26,out.
00:28:26,00:28:33,"I suggested a question for QI, which was, how does Roll Paris sleep at night?"
00:28:33,00:28:44,"We passed the bullet there, right?"
00:28:44,00:28:45,Oh my god.
00:28:45,00:28:47,I actually own a didgeridoo.
00:28:47,00:28:48,No you don't.
00:28:48,00:28:49,Promise?
00:28:49,00:28:51,I was given it as a present for my 16th birthday.
00:28:51,00:28:52,Can you play it?
00:28:52,00:28:53,No.
00:28:53,00:28:54,It's very hard to play.
00:28:54,00:28:55,Yeah.
00:28:55,00:28:56,I've only got one note out of it.
00:28:56,00:29:00,"And you need a circular breathing the whole way through, which I can't do."
00:29:00,00:29:04,"And I read that when the way that they get different sounds, it's all to do with the way"
00:29:04,00:29:06,that you shape your lip once it's inside.
00:29:06,00:29:11,"So in the way that if you were saying words like, hello, hello, hello, that would be like,"
00:29:11,00:29:15,"oh, and then if you're like, wow, wow, wow, wow, wait, do you put your lips inside?"
00:29:15,00:29:17,I think your lips go inside the different way.
00:29:17,00:29:18,I see now.
00:29:18,00:29:26,"Because it stretches to the mouth, unbelievably."
00:29:26,00:29:30,How do these guys do it?
00:29:30,00:29:36,This explains my short-lived trumpet career as well.
00:29:36,00:29:41,"But it is a circular breathing, right?"
00:29:41,00:29:42,That means it can cure snoring.
00:29:42,00:29:43,Is that the answer?
00:29:43,00:29:44,"Yeah, I'm guessing."
00:29:44,00:29:45,I think it is.
00:29:45,00:29:50,"The strength and your whole respiratory tract, you know, it just makes everything stronger"
00:29:50,00:29:51,in the whole.
00:29:51,00:29:52,Yeah.
00:29:52,00:29:53,Yes.
00:29:53,00:29:54,And snoring is very problematic.
00:29:54,00:29:59,Apparently a third of people in relationships cite snoring as a problem in their relationship.
00:29:59,00:30:00,I thought.
00:30:00,00:30:01,In Finland.
00:30:01,00:30:02,Maybe they snore a little bit.
00:30:02,00:30:03,I know that.
00:30:03,00:30:05,I have snoring.
00:30:05,00:30:06,Bad.
00:30:06,00:30:07,I have bad snoring.
00:30:07,00:30:08,Yeah.
00:30:08,00:30:09,I'm talking.
00:30:09,00:30:10,Yeah.
00:30:10,00:30:15,"And I talk to my wife about it every morning, because I'm like, was it bad?"
00:30:15,00:30:21,"Last night with my snoring, and was it bad for you last night?"
00:30:21,00:30:23,"And she's always, she's like, no, I really like it."
00:30:23,00:30:27,"It's really, it's God, you're a lucky man."
00:30:27,00:30:28,I do.
00:30:28,00:30:29,Or I've married a freak.
00:30:29,00:30:31,I don't know what it's going.
00:30:31,00:30:35,"But she says, because it's consistent, you know, it has a rhythm."
00:30:35,00:30:40,"It feels like, you know, you're out at sea or, you know, there's a..."
00:30:40,00:30:42,I think I have a very pleasurable snore.
00:30:42,00:30:47,"Did you know that she is suffering more than you are probably, so when snoring is cured,"
00:30:47,00:30:52,people's partner's quality of life in proves more than the snores quality of life.
00:30:52,00:30:57,And apparently the partners of snores wake up on average 21 times an hour.
00:30:57,00:30:58,What?
00:30:58,00:30:59,What?
00:30:59,00:31:00,Yeah.
00:31:00,00:31:03,"Like a little bit, you know, like you send me wake up and then you fall back to sleep."
00:31:03,00:31:04,Wow.
00:31:04,00:31:05,That's amazing.
00:31:05,00:31:06,That's amazing.
00:31:06,00:31:07,I'm sorry.
00:31:07,00:31:09,"Well, no, it's about didry days."
00:31:09,00:31:13,But it is about didry days.
00:31:13,00:31:14,"All right, didry days."
00:31:14,00:31:18,This is just a story that was in the BBC news website.
00:31:18,00:31:19,It's from a few years ago.
00:31:19,00:31:20,It's from 2004.
00:31:20,00:31:24,"And the story is, ""Attendling train driver calls two terror alerts when he mistook a didry"
00:31:24,00:31:26,"do for a grenade launcher."""
00:31:26,00:31:36,He's a train driver in London and he reported that he had seen a man carrying a grenade launcher.
00:31:36,00:31:40,And other passengers said the man fitting the driver's description of the suspect had
00:31:40,00:31:42,"been there, but only had a didry do."
00:31:42,00:31:43,Right.
00:31:43,00:31:44,That happened in the morning.
00:31:44,00:31:52,"Then later the same day, the same driver reported seeing the man taking aim at love production."
00:31:52,00:31:56,"And the terror police said, ""This time we found the man with the didry do."""
00:31:56,00:32:00,"He added, ""The driver was quite right to inform us about what he genuinely thought was"
00:32:00,00:32:04,"a terrorist threat on both occasions, which is you can't really say anything else."
00:32:04,00:32:05,"Can you?"""
00:32:05,00:32:06,If you're an idiot.
00:32:06,00:32:07,Don't phone in.
00:32:07,00:32:08,You can't say that.
00:32:08,00:32:13,"He must have been so annoying with the second time calling, saying, ""I can't believe you"
00:32:13,00:32:16,"guys were irresponsible enough not to catch him at the first time round, and I'm having"
00:32:16,00:32:17,"to tell you again."""
00:32:17,00:32:22,The traditional mouth-launched grenade launcher.
00:32:22,00:32:28,"I was trying to work out, actually, because didry do is obviously very long, very wide,"
00:32:28,00:32:33,"how they hollow out the inside of a didry do, so I started googling it and couldn't"
00:32:33,00:32:34,find anything.
00:32:34,00:32:35,Yeah.
00:32:35,00:32:36,Turmites do it.
00:32:36,00:32:37,Not really.
00:32:37,00:32:38,Yeah.
00:32:38,00:32:39,They train turmites.
00:32:39,00:32:40,Turmites.
00:32:40,00:32:41,No.
00:32:41,00:32:44,"They're kind of naturally occurring, aren't they?"
00:32:44,00:32:48,So you get a big bit of eucalyptus and the turmites live inside and they eat all the inside
00:32:48,00:32:51,bit and then you can cut it off and you've got naturally occurring.
00:32:51,00:32:54,So you have to wait for a didry do to naturally occur before?
00:32:54,00:32:56,"Yeah, but it's not like a long way."
00:32:56,00:33:00,"It's not like people buy, like, filled in planks of wood and then they sit there staring"
00:33:00,00:33:01,at it.
00:33:01,00:33:02,They're just in the wild.
00:33:02,00:33:09,"But I mean, it's like we're just we're taking wild instruments and bringing them, like we're"
00:33:09,00:33:10,not even making them.
00:33:10,00:33:15,"We're just finding them in the wild, taking them from their habitat and then sticking our"
00:33:15,00:33:17,mouth right around the rim of them.
00:33:17,00:33:19,"Okay, we're going to have to wrap up at a sec."
00:33:19,00:33:22,If you guys got anything more before we do?
00:33:22,00:33:23,There's a bed you can buy.
00:33:23,00:33:25,It's like a robotic bed.
00:33:25,00:33:26,Oh.
00:33:26,00:33:27,Oh.
00:33:27,00:33:28,Like my um...
00:33:28,00:33:29,A rattle thing.
00:33:29,00:33:30,Yeah.
00:33:30,00:33:31,Yeah.
00:33:31,00:33:32,Yeah.
00:33:32,00:33:35,"But anyway, this is amazing."
00:33:35,00:33:40,It has sensors in it and it can tell when you're snoring and then it kind of just moves you
00:33:40,00:33:43,very slowly into a better position so you won't snore.
00:33:43,00:33:44,Oh.
00:33:44,00:33:45,That is not incredible.
00:33:45,00:33:48,And it also will warm up your feet.
00:33:48,00:33:52,"So you'll tell if you've got cold feet and it'll go, ""Oh no, I'm going to warm up."""
00:33:52,00:33:53,That's incredible.
00:33:53,00:33:54,How can it tell?
00:33:54,00:33:56,"Oh, they're clever robots, aren't they here?"
00:33:56,00:33:57,"Yeah, mate."
00:33:57,00:33:59,They're doing some assaults inside you.
00:33:59,00:34:00,They are.
00:34:00,00:34:01,Oh.
00:34:01,00:34:02,That's the robot for listeners.
00:34:02,00:34:04,It's a colonoscopy robot.
00:34:04,00:34:05,Get the word out.
00:34:05,00:34:06,We don't have time.
00:34:06,00:34:07,We don't have time.
00:34:07,00:34:08,"Okay, that's it."
00:34:08,00:34:09,That is all of our facts.

00:34:30,00:34:32,It's out on November the 2nd.
00:34:32,00:34:35,We're about to give one away to the best fact that we've received from the audience of which
00:34:35,00:34:36,we have picked.
00:34:36,00:34:37,"James, have you got it?"
00:34:37,00:34:38,Yes.
00:34:38,00:34:41,The winner is @jessserrax on Twitter.
00:34:41,00:34:48,Her fact is that the Northeast has the greatest variety of ginger hair in the world with 47
00:34:48,00:34:49,shades.
00:34:49,00:34:50,Wow.
00:34:50,00:34:52,47 shades of ginger.
00:34:52,00:34:58,That is a book that I would definitely be down for.
00:34:58,00:34:59,Okay.
00:34:59,00:35:00,That's it.
00:35:00,00:35:03,We'll be back again next week with another episode.
00:35:03,00:35:05,"Thank you so much for being here, guys."
00:35:05,00:35:06,That was really fun.
00:35:06,00:35:07,We'll see you again.
