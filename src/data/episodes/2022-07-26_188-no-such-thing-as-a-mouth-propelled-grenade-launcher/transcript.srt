00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:22,600
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of "No Such Things

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,580
 A Fish A Weekly Podcast" coming to you this week

6
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,820
 from the stand in Newcastle!

7
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:32,680
 [APPLAUSE]

8
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,820
 I am sitting here with Anne Chazinski, James Harkin,

9
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,300
 and Andrew Hunter Murray.

10
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,580
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

11
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,340
 to share our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

12
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,880
 And now it is time for fact number one.

13
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,620
 And that is James.

14
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:52,540
 OK, my fact this week is that Mothara has only one Guinness

15
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,060
 world record.

16
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,980
 And it is in the 100-metre sac race.

17
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:00,100
 [LAUGHTER]

18
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:05,940
 When did I score sports day here with that?

19
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,700
 I don't know why he did it, but he did it.

20
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,900
 I read an article, and it said, "Mothara needs a world record

21
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,900
 to seal his place among the old-time greats."

22
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,220
 And I thought, I'll check if he has one, and he does.

23
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:21,260
 He has one other one, which is a two-mile indoor run,

24
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,900
 but that's not in the Guinness Book of Records.

25
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,700
 In the Guinness Book of Records, this is the only one.

26
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,260
 And he's about to lose it.

27
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,380
 What, really?

28
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,220
 Yeah.

29
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,580
 And there's a guy called Stephen Wildish from Rotten.

30
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:38,580
 And Mothara got 39.91 seconds for his 100 meters.

31
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:43,220
 And Stephen Wildish has already got 28 seconds, OK?

32
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,180
 But unfortunately, two weeks after he did it,

33
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,180
 he got a letter from Guinness saying

34
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:50,740
 that to get the world record, he needed a 50 kilogram sac.

35
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,620
 And his sac was only 30 kilograms.

36
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,740
 I thought for a second, you meant the sac had to weigh 50 kilograms.

37
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:01,660
 And I am amazed, anyone finishes it.

38
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,260
 So anyway, I got in touch with Stephen Wildish.

39
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:08,140
 And he's going to repeat his attempt next week.

40
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:11,420
 And he's really confident that he's definitely going to do it.

41
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:15,580
 And so that means that by probably the week after this goes out,

42
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,900
 Mothara will have no Guinness World Records.

43
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,020
 So we snuck in.

44
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,380
 Right, this definitely needs to go out this Friday, James.

45
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,220
 What's the speed that he managed to clock in for the record?

46
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,780
 So Stephen managed to do it at 28 seconds for the 100 meters.

47
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:32,460
 So a normal 100 meters form, who say Mothar would be just under 10 seconds.

48
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,260
 So yeah, you know, it's not that fast.

49
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,420
 But it's quite fast.

50
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,660
 And I asked him why.

51
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:41,020
 I asked Stephen why he was so much better at the sac race than Mothara.

52
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:47,260
 And he says, unlike Mothar, I have little legs, but large calf muscles.

53
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:52,540
 And I asked him if he has any inspirational words for the people of Newcastle.

54
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:59,580
 And he said, "Inspirational words, always check your sac."

55
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,020
 Very good.

56
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:01,700
 A wise man.

57
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:06,460
 So Mothara, you're saying, has the Guinness World Record for the sac race,

58
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:09,020
 but he also has-- but he does have a world record.

59
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,980
 He just has one other world record, but it's not a special Guinness one.

60
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,220
 It's just like a-- just the IWAF or something.

61
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,500
 Yeah, but it's a world record.

62
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,900
 I don't think like when you say bowl gets an Olympic world record, they're going,

63
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,420
 "Yeah, that's not Guinness World Record, isn't it?"

64
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,660
 Surely, that's more.

65
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,980
 I see what you mean, but it is.

66
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,740
 I mean, it's the two-mile indoor run.

67
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:34,180
 Yeah, I mean, I'm not putting him down, but why is that many different than an outdoor run?

68
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,580
 It's more impressive really to have a two-mile long building, frankly.

69
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:44,540
 It's true.

70
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,740
 It's weird though, because on the Guinness Record page for running records,

71
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,220
 they've really bumped him up, haven't they?

72
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,500
 He's in the top four.

73
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,460
 I think he's fourth one down, it's the sac race.

74
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:58,020
 So number one is fastest male marathon, number two is fastest female,

75
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,500
 number three is first to get three records at the Olympics,

76
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,060
 and number four is sneaks, and then with the sac race.

77
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,300
 And I don't want to put down Guinness Book of Records,

78
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,980
 but when they said that Stephen Wildish's sac was too small,

79
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:13,460
 I kind of think they're a bit upset about Mothara losing this record.

80
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,340
 Yeah.

81
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,540
 They didn't know, but they do have rules about how big the sac is.

82
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,460
 They actually do.

83
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:22,460
 They have one thing, which is if the sac is too big,

84
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:26,140
 they notice that people as opposed to like 100 meters long for it to sink.

85
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,140
 Yeah.

86
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:35,260
 But that's the main issue, really, because obviously in a sac race,

87
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,780
 you're hopping everywhere.

88
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:40,460
 If you have a slightly larger sac, people actually run inside the sac

89
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,180
 in order to get there, and that builds up speed in a way.

90
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,260
 You can kind of run, you can put your feet into little corners

91
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,100
 and do a little kind of wiggly run.

92
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,540
 But the thing is, it used to be in the 19th century in America

93
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,620
 that each college would have their athletics team,

94
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,660
 so they'd have a javelin thrower and a 100 meters runner.

95
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:01,380
 But they would all also have a sac race guy.

96
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,460
 And this was quite a big deal, and they would train,

97
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,060
 and they would really try and be awesome at the sac race.

98
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:09,620
 And some of them would hop, and some of them would run with the feet in the corners.

99
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,540
 And the hoppers were usually better.

100
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:15,620
 And the thing is that they came up with a technique of really hopping

101
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,540
 as far as they could.

102
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,220
 And it was quite ungainly.

103
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,100
 And sometimes they'd fall over.

104
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:21,820
 OK.

105
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,260
 But they were so good that when they fell over,

106
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:27,980
 they sort of did a little somersault and could get back on their feet immediately.

107
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,220
 And they virtually lost no time whatsoever.

108
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,660
 Oh, wow.

109
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,780
 And he's anal thing that he was talking about earlier.

110
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,300
 Sorry.

111
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:39,860
 So for the people listening to this podcast on Friday,

112
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:43,140
 and I would hope you'd edit this bit right out.

113
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,900
 No, I don't have a chance.

114
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:50,940
 There's a new robot.

115
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,020
 We don't have time for this, we don't have time.

116
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,500
 No, we don't have time, no, no.

117
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,620
 People can just imagine what you were thinking about.

118
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,780
 OK.

119
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,940
 Do you know there's a 100 meters on all fours world record?

120
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,100
 Is there?

121
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,540
 And it's 15.71 seconds.

122
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,340
 That's fast.

123
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,340
 Really?

124
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,740
 They are unbelievably fast.

125
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,860
 The guys who do it, it's so good.

126
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:17,140
 So it's the same man who's broken the record four times since 2008.

127
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,340
 He's a Japanese guy.

128
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:26,860
 And to practice, he mops flaws on all fours, which is fun to say, as well as to do.

129
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,420
 How does that help him practice?

130
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:32,340
 I think he just gets habituated to being on all fours all the time and moving around.

131
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,580
 And he's less likely.

132
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:37,180
 But it's misrepresentative of the actual purchase you can get on the ground.

133
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,020
 That would be more useful if he was ice skating.

134
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,100
 Because then you have the slip of a...

135
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,220
 It's like training, get altitude, isn't it?

136
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,660
 Because if you can do it on a slippy floor and then you get on a proper road.

137
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,660
 Yeah.

138
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,660
 He's not wrong.

139
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,660
 Yeah, he's right.

140
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,660
 He's right.

141
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,460
 These stupid sports, like sports day sports, used to be more difficult.

142
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,460
 Stupid sports.

143
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,860
 You know, sports that are for the people who aren't sporty at sports day.

144
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,140
 We've all got a list and I had pole vaults on mine.

145
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,660
 Pole vaults are stupid sports.

146
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,660
 Stupid sport.

147
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,060
 I'm thinking more egg and spoon, the three-legged, all that kind of stuff.

148
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:11,060
 But I was looking them up in the British newspaper archive to see what people used to do

149
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,740
 in the olden days about them.

150
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:17,620
 And it turns out that the egg and spoon race, for instance, used to be done while punting.

151
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,060
 So there was a reference.

152
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:24,860
 This is, in fact, this is the earliest usage in the OED of egg and spoon.

153
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:29,260
 It's an 1894 and it said the gentleman had a turn in the egg and spoon race

154
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:34,060
 in which competitors had to punt with one hand and balance an egg and spoon with another.

155
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,860
 So that is actually much harder, you know, punting for people who aren't

156
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:40,660
 from Oxford or Cambridge is where you are on a boat standing up and you drop a stick in

157
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,660
 and you have to power your boat along.

158
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,460
 At the same time, it's carrying an egg and spoon.

159
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,460
 Wow.

160
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,460
 I thought you meant punting us and putting a bet on with the horses.

161
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:52,060
 No, no, that was strictly forbidden, actually.

162
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,340
 And the wheelbarrow race was blindfolded.

163
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:58,860
 This was in the 19th century at, for instance, a cubic blindfolded.

164
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,060
 And wheelbarrows don't have eyes.

165
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,060
 Exactly.

166
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,100
 It's just more realistic.

167
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,420
 I think you're both blindfolded.

168
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:10,020
 So this is for Queen Victoria's Jubilee, there was a huge wheelbarrow race.

169
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,620
 And she didn't participate.

170
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,620
 Sorry, the wheelbarrow.

171
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,820
 Are we talking, we're talking where you're carrying someone's legs and they're moving

172
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,820
 on their hands.

173
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,820
 Not a wheelbarrow, wheelbarrow.

174
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:23,220
 No, no, where there are two people, one of them is pretending to be a wheelbarrow.

175
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,220
 Yeah.

176
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,220
 Yeah, you have to be blindfolded, which makes it a lot more difficult.

177
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,220
 That's you.

178
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,220
 That's nuts.

179
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,220
 Hey, you know that Mofara does the mobot?

180
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,220
 Oh, yeah.

181
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:37,860
 It turns out that he's actually being the M from YMCA.

182
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:43,780
 I said, are you saying that's where he came up with it or just, no, they came, so he does

183
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,780
 that thing.

184
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:45,780
 He does his mobot.

185
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:51,020
 And the inspiration from that was he was on a TV show, Claire Bolding and James Corden were

186
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,580
 trying to work out what he should do to celebrate the win.

187
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,780
 And Claire Bolding was the one who invented it.

188
00:08:55,780 --> 00:09:00,140
 James Corden called it the mobot, but she said it's the M from YMCA.

189
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:04,740
 If you had someone who'd just done a vault in the gymnastics, stood next to him, you only

190
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,700
 need a C and an A and you've got the whole thing.

191
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:11,900
 But wait, that's not, it stands for the M of his name.

192
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,980
 I think Claire Bolding was just trying to explain what it looked like to people if they weren't

193
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:16,980
 watching the TV, right?

194
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,620
 He doesn't do it as a tribute to the YMCA.

195
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,620
 I don't think.

196
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,540
 No, he's plagiarised.

197
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:27,460
 One of the greatest dancers, Mr Farah's lawyers and listening to big claim, it's not

198
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:30,460
 one we all support on this show.

199
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:34,700
 Do you know something Mo Farah did do, which is not that cool, actually.

200
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:39,180
 He has a fellow runner called Chris Thompson and they're good friends in Chris Thompson won

201
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:43,580
 Silver Medal in Barcelona when Mo won gold a few years ago, I don't know why I'm calling

202
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:47,300
 him Mo, I don't know him, when Mo Farah won gold a few years ago.

203
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:52,460
 But the first time they ran a race together, Mo Farah said was encouraging him and said,

204
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:56,340
 "How about we'll run this race, we're going to win it, we'll both run it, we'll hold

205
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:00,180
 hands as we run, and then we can cross the finish line at the same time."

206
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:04,820
 They did it and they held hands for the full race and then with 10 metres to go, Mo Farah

207
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:09,300
 let go of him, push it aside and sprint to the end of the race.

208
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:15,980
 The 100 metre record for Egon Spoon Race is, do you think it's more or less than Stephen

209
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:16,980
 Wildish's?

210
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,980
 28 seconds.

211
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:18,980
 28 seconds.

212
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:19,980
 Okay.

213
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:20,980
 Quicker Rosloas.

214
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:21,980
 Quicker.

215
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:22,980
 It is quicker.

216
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:31,060
 Yeah, it's 16.59 seconds but it was set by Sally Pearson who is a professional 100 metre runner

217
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:37,020
 or she's a herdler but she's quite famous and she beat a guy called Asherita Firman who

218
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,300
 you guys might recognise, we've mentioned him before.

219
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:45,820
 He has more than 100 world records, mostly in what Anna might call the stupid spots.

220
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:49,300
 Triple jump.

221
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,100
 I got loads.

222
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,660
 I can't think of many non-stupid spots.

223
00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:00,860
 Well I reckon he must have been pretty annoyed to have lost his 100 metre Egon Spoon Race because

224
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:07,860
 the very next month he then broke the 100 metres carrying an Egon Spoon in the mouth record.

225
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,860
 Wow.

226
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:11,380
 Do you even know that was a sport?

227
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,180
 I suspect it probably wasn't.

228
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:18,980
 Do you know that the school sport stays a regular feature of the me used to be the pillow fight?

229
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:22,380
 Now that's a sport.

230
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,380
 How do you win the pillow fight?

231
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,380
 I don't know.

232
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,380
 It didn't actually say.

233
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,380
 I'm sorry where there's article were.

234
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,380
 The winner was just announced.

235
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,860
 We used to play in Australia for sports.

236
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:34,020
 You would sit on a big wooden pole and you'd each have a pillow and you'd try and whack

237
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:37,020
 each other off.

238
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:40,020
 Sorry.

239
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:44,140
 I wasn't the way you had such a traditional education then.

240
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:48,180
 OK, it's time for fact number two.

241
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,860
 And that is Andy.

242
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:56,180
 My fact is that the inside of a Kit Kat is made of more Kit Kat's.

243
00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:00,420
 Kit Kat's are an infinite recursive loop is what I'm trying to say.

244
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,420
 This is so cool.

245
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,060
 I mean it can't be true, right?

246
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:06,780
 Because where did the first Kit Kat insides come from?

247
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,940
 Nobody knows.

248
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,260
 Yeah, this is like a chicken and egg situation isn't it?

249
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,260
 It kind of, yeah.

250
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:15,100
 So except the eggs are not made of mashed up.

251
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:19,220
 Chickens.

252
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:24,740
 Yeah, it's kind of, it's kind of like that.

253
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:28,980
 So basically during the production process of Kit Kat some of them don't meet the very strict

254
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:34,740
 criteria for a proper Kit Kat, you know, the wrong shape or they got too many fingers.

255
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,140
 I don't know.

256
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:43,380
 But anyway, they're wrong and they are, they're rejected and they are ground up and they are

257
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:48,580
 the filling layer between the wafer bits in a Kit Kat is made of those plus a couple of

258
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:51,380
 other things as well, more sugar.

259
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,620
 So yeah, they sit the headlines earlier this year.

260
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,940
 I'd never hit the headlines.

261
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,180
 Sure, it was a slow news day, wasn't it?

262
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:02,020
 I'd never noticed until you said this fact I looked into it, there was a layer between the

263
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,020
 wafer and a Kit Kat.

264
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,820
 I just thought it was chocolate around the outside and wafer on the inside.

265
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,060
 Sometimes you get one which is all chocolate.

266
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,060
 Wow.

267
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,060
 Wow.

268
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,060
 It's a good day that I say when you go.

269
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,060
 Have you had one of those?

270
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,060
 Oh, yeah.

271
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,060
 Has anyone else?

272
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,060
 Yeah.

273
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,060
 About half the rum, okay.

274
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,060
 Good.

275
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,060
 Wow.

276
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,060
 Okay.

277
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:25,500
 You really, honestly, Andy, wait till it happens to you, it's a real life changer.

278
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:32,540
 But Kit Kat's, I only realise looking into this, what they mean in Japan, which is a lot.

279
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,540
 Everything.

280
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,540
 What do you mean?

281
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,540
 Everything.

282
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:38,380
 So Japanese people just love Kit Kat's and they've gone way more nuts than we have.

283
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:44,260
 So apparently, Kit Katzu is a Japanese expression that means surely win, so it basically means

284
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,260
 good luck.

285
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:49,700
 And so because of this coincidence, they're super popular in Japan and they've got loads

286
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,700
 of flavours.

287
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:54,780
 So they've got more than 300 different Kit Kat flavours in Japan.

288
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:58,860
 Nestily, they've just built a factory there specifically to make the weird-ass flavours

289
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,860
 that they have.

290
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:04,700
 So they have wasabi flavoured Kit Kat, they have soy sauce flavour, they have sushi flavoured

291
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,700
 Kit Kat.

292
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,500
 What do you guys, you haven't tried it?

293
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,500
 That's right.

294
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,500
 They're not going to enjoy it.

295
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:14,500
 They have, in Japan, made a Kit Kat which doubles up as a postcard and you can just put it

296
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:19,380
 in the post to someone because every year about half the children doing their exams get sent

297
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,020
 a Kit Kat for good luck because of that surely win thing.

298
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:26,820
 So Kit Kat invented a one that's a postcard and you can just send it to someone, just put

299
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:31,260
 a Kit Kat into the letterbox, you did it, you'd be arrested.

300
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:36,140
 We're only one envelope away from that.

301
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:43,860
 Yeah, but you know that Kit Kat started out as Mutton Pies.

302
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,500
 This is true.

303
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:57,380
 So there was a club in London called the Kit Kat Club and it was, it was run by an innkeeper

304
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:02,740
 called Christopher Kat, who was called Kit Kat and every, all the literary figures of

305
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:07,860
 time used to go there and he would serve them Mutton Pies which they called a Kit Kat.

306
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:13,100
 And so the idea is that that just became a name of a popular food source and then eventually

307
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,380
 it turned into Kit Kat.

308
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:22,420
 No one has acknowledged that this is true, but the Kit Kat Club, the Kit Kat Club is definitely

309
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,420
 true.

310
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,420
 It's definitely true.

311
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,420
 It's association as well.

312
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,420
 Yeah, yeah.

313
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:29,460
 So the original Kit Kat definitely was Mutton Pies but get this, the ceilings were so low

314
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:33,060
 in the Kit Kat Club that they were beautiful establishments.

315
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:37,980
 So what they, what they did was have paintings all over the club but because the ceilings

316
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:43,820
 were so low, they needed to get paintings that were longer on the, well on landscape rather

317
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,220
 than portrait.

318
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:50,460
 And there's a theory that the reason that Kit Kat so shaped like they are is because they're

319
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:54,940
 paying tribute to the squatty paintings of the Kit Kat Club in London.

320
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:58,060
 Sorry, I didn't realise when he said no one's acknowledge this is true, you were talking

321
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:04,580
 about the thing you were about to say.

322
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,580
 You know the Kit Kat slogan?

323
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,580
 I have a break.

324
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,580
 Have a break.

325
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,580
 Have a break.

326
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,580
 I only got that yesterday.

327
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,660
 That's a pun.

328
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:17,860
 I didn't realise it was a reference to Kit Kat's breaking.

329
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,540
 I thought it was just like, you know, yeah, a break or what?

330
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,540
 I didn't get the other meaning.

331
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,540
 And they only called that.

332
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,540
 Did everyone get that?

333
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,540
 No, no, no.

334
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,540
 No.

335
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,780
 Of course everyone fucking got it.

336
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:34,020
 As far as if the slogan writer's going to be at a time going finally.

337
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,020
 Was it too obtuse?

338
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,260
 What was I doing that was wrong?

339
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:39,060
 Sorry, can I join Anna's Club of people who didn't get it?

340
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,060
 Sorry, sorry.

341
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:46,500
 In the, in the advert, they break it, as they say, have a break.

342
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,500
 I didn't, I know.

343
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,260
 I know, I know.

344
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,260
 We know all the clues were there, James.

345
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,260
 Some sort of two things.

346
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:56,820
 And it only came about in the 50s when they toughened up the materials that they made Kit Kat's

347
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:00,580
 from, and they were very proud of the new snapping sound that it made.

348
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,580
 And so actually the crucial thing about it is the breaking sound.

349
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:09,860
 Look who suddenly the expert on the etymology and the standing of the slogan.

350
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,180
 I have a fact about chocolate.

351
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,180
 OK.

352
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:16,620
 The average chocolate bar is about 20 to 25% fat, 40 to 50% sugar, right?

353
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,820
 So it's one gram of fat to two grams of sugar, right?

354
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:19,820
 OK.

355
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:24,260
 It's very unusual in nature to find those ratios of sugar and fat together.

356
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:27,180
 So if you have nuts, they have lots of fat, but no sugar.

357
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:31,540
 If you have fruit, loads of sugar, but no fat, there is a theory that the reason we like

358
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:37,260
 chocolate is because the place you find that same ratio, one gram fat, two gram of sugar,

359
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,260
 is breast milk.

360
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,260
 Oh.

361
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,260
 No way.

362
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,100
 Yeah, 4% fat, 8% sugar.

363
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,540
 So it may be that we are trying to recreate.

364
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,540
 No.

365
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,540
 No.

366
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,540
 Are earliest.

367
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,540
 Yeah.

368
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,540
 Come for food.

369
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,540
 That's what's happening.

370
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:59,580
 Why do you think the Terry's chocolate orange is so successful?

371
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,580
 I don't know.

372
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,580
 Why?

373
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:10,420
 Because you were breastfed by an umpa-lumpa, and you're trying to get back to that.

374
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,420
 Wait, don't.

375
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,340
 The Terry's chocolate orange isn't orange.

376
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,660
 You know you have to take the wrapping off.

377
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,300
 I found a really cool thing.

378
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:23,060
 I was looking into how they test chocolate, and it led me down a little road that got me

379
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:28,420
 to MacVitties and all sorts of just how they, they, for candies and biscuits and chocolate

380
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,700
 biscuits and stuff.

381
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:36,660
 And um, there's a dummy that tests crumb uh, looseage once you're biting into it.

382
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:40,460
 So it's a robot dummy that just bites, got plastic teeth.

383
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:45,580
 It's called a crumb test dummy, and the idea is that MacVitties have a laboratory where

384
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:52,580
 they put it into its mouth and it just goes up and the advantage is that it never stops

385
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:56,460
 doing that because it doesn't need to breathe because Andy, what is it?

386
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,460
 The robot.

387
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,460
 Yes.

388
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:02,860
 It's a bit like the anal thing you were talking about.

389
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,860
 No.

390
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,420
 Do we need to move on to the next fact?

391
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,420
 Yeah, we do actually.

392
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:13,420
 We do need to move on to the next fact, um, sorry Andy to cut you off again, try to get

393
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,420
 to it before the end of the show.

394
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:19,380
 Um, and now it is time for fact number three and that is Chazinski.

395
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:25,980
 Yeah, my fact this week is that the first hamsters to come to the UK arrived in a coat pocket.

396
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,980
 Oh.

397
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:27,980
 I know.

398
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:28,980
 So sweet.

399
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:34,740
 The story of hamsters is really interesting.

400
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:41,220
 So um, basically there was a scientist called, don't be skeptical, there was a scientist

401
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:46,340
 called Saul Adler back in the 1920s, 1930s and he decided that hamsters would be similar,

402
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:51,420
 were similar enough to humans that they might serve as useful lab animals for obvious reasons

403
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:54,380
 that I don't need to go into hamsters humans, basically the same.

404
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:59,780
 Um, and he, no, he specifically wanted to try out stuff that might cure parasitic diseases

405
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,860
 on them.

406
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:04,820
 And so he brought three hamsters back from Syria in 1931.

407
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:09,340
 So all the pet hamsters that you have had in your childhoods and that you've ever seen

408
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:14,740
 are all descended, um, from the, this tiny batch of Syrian hamsters that these guys found

409
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,540
 in the 1930s.

410
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:19,380
 And yeah, he smuggled these guys back in his coat pocket.

411
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:23,500
 And didn't he smuggle them, I might be thinking of a different person, but didn't he smuggle

412
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,940
 them back in the coat pocket because they ate their way out of the box that they were

413
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:28,940
 in?

414
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:29,940
 Yes.

415
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:30,940
 It's a really exciting story.

416
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:31,940
 Yeah.

417
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,940
 Yeah.

418
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,940
 It is.

419
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,140
 No, they got, they got a dozen, didn't they just start?

420
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,140
 Yeah.

421
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:41,060
 And then the mother started, the mother killed one of the babies, so then they had 10 less.

422
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,060
 Okay, fine.

423
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,540
 And then half of them escaped and had to be recaptured.

424
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:48,660
 And then they put them in a wooden box and they chewed through that and then were recaptured.

425
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,860
 It's like the great escape, but with hamsters.

426
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:55,220
 And that was with, the guy was called Israel Aheroni, wasn't he?

427
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,740
 Who, he was the guy who was determined that he'd get these hamsters.

428
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,940
 And it sounds like his life depended on it.

429
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:04,020
 Um, when, when these five escaped, he was absolutely devastated.

430
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,180
 He said he was shaken to his depths.

431
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:11,620
 And imagine, yeah, when the mother ate her children and then he had three left and then I think,

432
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,820
 uh, oh no, yeah, one, one sibling ate another.

433
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,420
 And then he had to make the brother and sister, didn't he, that was nice.

434
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,420
 Yes.

435
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,420
 So they're all products of incest?

436
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,420
 No.

437
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,420
 No.

438
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,420
 All your childhood hamsters?

439
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,420
 Yeah.

440
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,420
 Incest.

441
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:28,340
 That's actually one of, that's one of the reasons they're so useful, uh, because they're

442
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:32,220
 similarity to humans is genuinely because they're very susceptible to heart disease

443
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:36,140
 hamsters, um, as susceptible as humans and also that's why they're quite good to study.

444
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,980
 And the reason they're susceptible is because they're all very imbred.

445
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:39,980
 Really?

446
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,980
 Yeah, apparently so.

447
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,980
 Wow.

448
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:47,740
 The thing is about, um, hamsters is it's really weird why they become popular pets really because

449
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,100
 they only live for a couple of years.

450
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,100
 Tick?

451
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,100
 Yeah.

452
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,100
 [laughter]

453
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:57,940
 That is a certain comfort, James, in knowing this is a short-term contract.

454
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,940
 Yeah.

455
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:04,380
 Well, they don't like being handled, you know, they're nocturnal.

456
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,660
 Oh, during the day they don't do anything.

457
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,660
 Are they nocturnal?

458
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,660
 I read that they, well, in the wild, they're definitely nocturnal.

459
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:13,340
 Both of mine as a child were nocturnal.

460
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,500
 They just don't want to hang out with you, man.

461
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,500
 [laughter]

462
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,500
 I read as well that they're...

463
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,020
 It's because I get pointed at them and saying incest.

464
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,020
 [laughter]

465
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,180
 You should be ashamed.

466
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,180
 Yeah.

467
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,180
 Clocks, ticking boys.

468
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,180
 [laughter]

469
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,180
 You have two months left.

470
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,220
 I've had mobile phone contracts longer than you.

471
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,220
 [laughter]

472
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:37,380
 I've heard that you can...that they are able to drink alcohol because they hold...they

473
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,220
 hold things...what is it?

474
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:43,700
 They hold stuff in their cheeks for so long and then they hoard them, and they don't eat

475
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:47,140
 them too much later, but then it ferments and it turns into alcohol, so they've had to turn

476
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:52,300
 their digestive system into one that can just downboose really quickly and not die, which

477
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,940
 a lot of animals can't do, and these are serum on from Newcastle, basically.

478
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:56,940
 [laughter]

479
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:00,460
 Risky.

480
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,980
 The pouches are amazing, though.

481
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,620
 They're cheeks stretch back to their hips when they need them too.

482
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,620
 What?

483
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:08,820
 Yeah, they basically go and run down the whole length of their body, and they switch off

484
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:13,140
 their saliva glands to stop themselves accidentally metabolising the food that they want

485
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:17,700
 to store, so they stop making saliva until they feel hungry and then they start making

486
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,700
 again.

487
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:22,460
 I read one thing that said that they can put enough stuff in their cheeks that will make

488
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,460
 their heads triple in size.

489
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,460
 [laughter]

490
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,460
 What?

491
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:31,060
 Well, I looked at the size of the hamsters head and did a bit of working out, and basically

492
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:36,580
 it's the equivalent of me fitting a large tin of paint in my mouth.

493
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,580
 [laughter]

494
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:41,620
 And ladies and gentlemen, we're off finale tonight.

495
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,620
 [laughter]

496
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:49,420
 I think that's why they were called saddlebags, right, so when they first went to Syria to find

497
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:53,980
 them, they realised the Arabic word for them, translated as Mr. saddlebags, so they called

498
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:54,980
 hamsters.

499
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,980
 Well, I'm not sure why, but I assume that must be it.

500
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:57,980
 I think that is it.

501
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:58,980
 Yeah.

502
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,980
 Have you heard of America's Hamster King?

503
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:01,980
 No.

504
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:02,980
 He's a great guy.

505
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:06,580
 He's the guy who popularised the hamster across the whole of the USA.

506
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:10,540
 He's a guy from Mobile, Alabama, and his name was Albert F. Marsh.

507
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:17,060
 And so I think in the early 50s, but I might be wrong, might be 40s, he took one hamster

508
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:20,620
 on as a payment of a $1 gambling debt.

509
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,980
 That was how the debt to him was paid off in a hamster.

510
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:23,980
 Right.

511
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:28,580
 He must have got another one from somewhere because he then breathed them.

512
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:33,140
 But within three years, he was making the equivalent of $1.8 million a year, just from sending

513
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:37,300
 hamsters out to people, and the way he built this business, it was a huge business.

514
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,300
 He can't have been making that much money.

515
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,300
 How much was he charging this time?

516
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,300
 He made him...

517
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:46,460
 I think he charged about $9, no, it's about $9, which would have been a lot more then.

518
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,460
 But this is incredible.

519
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:51,220
 So he built the business up and he made it absolutely massive really quickly, and his

520
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:56,700
 shipping method was to send a hamster to the address you wanted it sent to in a coffee

521
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,540
 can with a potato.

522
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:04,500
 The potato was for it to eat and drink along the way, and it would arrive, and you would

523
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,700
 have a hamster and then no potato in a coffee tin.

524
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:16,460
 That is worse than Ryanair food, I've got to say, one potato, come on.

525
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:23,460
 I was reading that, so the idea of him bringing these bunch of hamsters in his coat pocket,

526
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:26,620
 I suddenly thought that's the idea of smuggling things in.

527
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:31,220
 I think I slightly misread the fact thinking it was smuggling in, but so I looked up smuggling,

528
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:34,100
 and that's where we're going now.

529
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,740
 But I was a story that happened just this year, and I'm so upset that it's not made it

530
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:41,100
 into the book, because it would have been perfect.

531
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:47,360
 A woman was arrested in Venezuela after several guards caught her trying to break her boyfriend

532
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:53,420
 out of jail by smuggling him out in the suitcase that she brought in with her.

533
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:56,760
 So she went in with her daughter, and she just had, "Oh, I've just got my suitcase with

534
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,760
 me."

535
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,860
 During the visit, while the guards were away, she opened it up, he got inside, they zipped

536
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:05,660
 him up, and then she tried to just walk out again with him, and she got quite far, but

537
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:10,380
 then she started struggling with the suitcase, and so they laid it down and they opened it

538
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:17,420
 up, and inside was a squished boyfriend, who, yeah, that is not the only person in suitcase

539
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:20,680
 crime story that has come from this year, from this year.

540
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,680
 No, yes.

541
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:27,260
 In the last week, there was a guy, I think in India, who was arrested, because he had been

542
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:33,480
 committed crime by getting himself loaded into luggage holds in a bag, and then he would

543
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:38,060
 get out of the bag, rob all the other bags in the luggage hold, and then get back into

544
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,060
 his bag.

545
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,060
 Oh, yes.

546
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:44,420
 Wait, how could he put everything in his bag with him?

547
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,580
 I think he might have, he might have just left at that point.

548
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,580
 No.

549
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:51,780
 Well, he might have just stolen small things, but imagine on that carousel, if you accidentally

550
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:55,380
 pick up the wrong bag, there's a small Indian man.

551
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,380
 Is this mine?

552
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,140
 No, that's not mine.

553
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:01,620
 All right, let's move on to our final fact.

554
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:05,500
 Okay, it's time for a final fact of the show, and that is my fact.

555
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:10,900
 My fact this week is that an effective way to treat snoring is to regularly play the

556
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,260
 didgeridoo.

557
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,260
 This has been done.

558
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,820
 It's been proven by scientists to work.

559
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,540
 No, listen, owing for the partner, is it?

560
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:21,100
 When you come home, you're like, darling, I've got fantastic news.

561
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,100
 I found a cure.

562
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:26,300
 I'm just going to constantly play the didgeridoo for the rest of our lives.

563
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:29,420
 Instead of sleeping, I will be in bed next to you, playing the didgeridoo.

564
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,740
 You won't even notice any snoring.

565
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:37,460
 Yeah, they did this as a test, they had 25 patients who all suffer from chronic snoring.

566
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:42,860
 They're 18 years old onwards, so they usually snoring affects people much older, but they

567
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:45,260
 wanted to start a younger age.

568
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:49,900
 And they had the more practice a didgeridoo for 5.9 days a per week.

569
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:55,660
 That's how it worked out, for 25.3 minutes per session.

570
00:27:55,660 --> 00:28:01,660
 And they found a remarkable recovery process of the nasal passage for when you're sleeping

571
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:05,980
 that you no longer were snoring either as intensely or at all.

572
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:10,660
 So if anyone here in the audience is a snorer, get yourself to Australia.

573
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:14,980
 It's a bit expensive, that's where they sell them, and yeah, start playing.

574
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:17,260
 So I found out about this a few years ago.

575
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:21,420
 I went on to the QI forums, which is where we do the research for the TV show, and I look

576
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:25,900
 for didgeridoo, and it turns out I'd post about this in 2006, which is when the report came

577
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:26,900
 out.

578
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:33,180
 I suggested a question for QI, which was, how does Roll Paris sleep at night?

579
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:44,140
 We passed the bullet there, right?

580
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,940
 Oh my god.

581
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,420
 I actually own a didgeridoo.

582
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,420
 No you don't.

583
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,420
 Promise?

584
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,020
 I was given it as a present for my 16th birthday.

585
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,020
 Can you play it?

586
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,020
 No.

587
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,020
 It's very hard to play.

588
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,020
 Yeah.

589
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,020
 I've only got one note out of it.

590
00:28:56,020 --> 00:29:00,820
 And you need a circular breathing the whole way through, which I can't do.

591
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:04,500
 And I read that when the way that they get different sounds, it's all to do with the way

592
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,540
 that you shape your lip once it's inside.

593
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:11,780
 So in the way that if you were saying words like, hello, hello, hello, that would be like,

594
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:15,660
 oh, and then if you're like, wow, wow, wow, wow, wait, do you put your lips inside?

595
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,500
 I think your lips go inside the different way.

596
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,500
 I see now.

597
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:26,620
 Because it stretches to the mouth, unbelievably.

598
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:30,660
 How do these guys do it?

599
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:36,740
 This explains my short-lived trumpet career as well.

600
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:41,340
 But it is a circular breathing, right?

601
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,980
 That means it can cure snoring.

602
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:43,980
 Is that the answer?

603
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:44,980
 Yeah, I'm guessing.

604
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:45,980
 I think it is.

605
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:50,500
 The strength and your whole respiratory tract, you know, it just makes everything stronger

606
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,500
 in the whole.

607
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,500
 Yeah.

608
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,500
 Yes.

609
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,500
 And snoring is very problematic.

610
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:59,100
 Apparently a third of people in relationships cite snoring as a problem in their relationship.

611
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,100
 I thought.

612
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,100
 In Finland.

613
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,100
 Maybe they snore a little bit.

614
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,100
 I know that.

615
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,100
 I have snoring.

616
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,100
 Bad.

617
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,100
 I have bad snoring.

618
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,100
 Yeah.

619
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,100
 I'm talking.

620
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,100
 Yeah.

621
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:15,900
 And I talk to my wife about it every morning, because I'm like, was it bad?

622
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:21,260
 Last night with my snoring, and was it bad for you last night?

623
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:23,660
 And she's always, she's like, no, I really like it.

624
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:27,220
 It's really, it's God, you're a lucky man.

625
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,220
 I do.

626
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,740
 Or I've married a freak.

627
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,180
 I don't know what it's going.

628
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:35,380
 But she says, because it's consistent, you know, it has a rhythm.

629
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:40,180
 It feels like, you know, you're out at sea or, you know, there's a...

630
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,500
 I think I have a very pleasurable snore.

631
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:47,660
 Did you know that she is suffering more than you are probably, so when snoring is cured,

632
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:52,700
 people's partner's quality of life in proves more than the snores quality of life.

633
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:57,060
 And apparently the partners of snores wake up on average 21 times an hour.

634
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,060
 What?

635
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,060
 What?

636
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,060
 Yeah.

637
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:03,900
 Like a little bit, you know, like you send me wake up and then you fall back to sleep.

638
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:04,900
 Wow.

639
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,900
 That's amazing.

640
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:06,900
 That's amazing.

641
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:07,900
 I'm sorry.

642
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,140
 Well, no, it's about didry days.

643
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:13,100
 But it is about didry days.

644
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,740
 All right, didry days.

645
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:18,220
 This is just a story that was in the BBC news website.

646
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,220
 It's from a few years ago.

647
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,220
 It's from 2004.

648
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:24,620
 And the story is, "Attendling train driver calls two terror alerts when he mistook a didry

649
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,820
 do for a grenade launcher."

650
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:36,060
 He's a train driver in London and he reported that he had seen a man carrying a grenade launcher.

651
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:40,020
 And other passengers said the man fitting the driver's description of the suspect had

652
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,060
 been there, but only had a didry do.

653
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,060
 Right.

654
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,300
 That happened in the morning.

655
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:52,540
 Then later the same day, the same driver reported seeing the man taking aim at love production.

656
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:56,500
 And the terror police said, "This time we found the man with the didry do."

657
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:00,300
 He added, "The driver was quite right to inform us about what he genuinely thought was

658
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:04,540
 a terrorist threat on both occasions, which is you can't really say anything else.

659
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,540
 Can you?"

660
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:06,540
 If you're an idiot.

661
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,540
 Don't phone in.

662
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,540
 You can't say that.

663
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:13,060
 He must have been so annoying with the second time calling, saying, "I can't believe you

664
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:16,780
 guys were irresponsible enough not to catch him at the first time round, and I'm having

665
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,780
 to tell you again."

666
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:22,580
 The traditional mouth-launched grenade launcher.

667
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:28,300
 I was trying to work out, actually, because didry do is obviously very long, very wide,

668
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:33,500
 how they hollow out the inside of a didry do, so I started googling it and couldn't

669
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,500
 find anything.

670
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,500
 Yeah.

671
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,500
 Turmites do it.

672
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,500
 Not really.

673
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,500
 Yeah.

674
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,500
 They train turmites.

675
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,500
 Turmites.

676
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,500
 No.

677
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,220
 They're kind of naturally occurring, aren't they?

678
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:48,460
 So you get a big bit of eucalyptus and the turmites live inside and they eat all the inside

679
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:51,100
 bit and then you can cut it off and you've got naturally occurring.

680
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:54,540
 So you have to wait for a didry do to naturally occur before?

681
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,580
 Yeah, but it's not like a long way.

682
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:00,580
 It's not like people buy, like, filled in planks of wood and then they sit there staring

683
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,580
 at it.

684
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,580
 They're just in the wild.

685
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:09,140
 But I mean, it's like we're just we're taking wild instruments and bringing them, like we're

686
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,340
 not even making them.

687
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:15,540
 We're just finding them in the wild, taking them from their habitat and then sticking our

688
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,540
 mouth right around the rim of them.

689
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,980
 Okay, we're going to have to wrap up at a sec.

690
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,020
 If you guys got anything more before we do?

691
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,780
 There's a bed you can buy.

692
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,020
 It's like a robotic bed.

693
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,020
 Oh.

694
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,020
 Oh.

695
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,020
 Like my um...

696
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,020
 A rattle thing.

697
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,020
 Yeah.

698
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,020
 Yeah.

699
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,020
 Yeah.

700
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:35,100
 But anyway, this is amazing.

701
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:40,380
 It has sensors in it and it can tell when you're snoring and then it kind of just moves you

702
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:43,380
 very slowly into a better position so you won't snore.

703
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,380
 Oh.

704
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,380
 That is not incredible.

705
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:48,260
 And it also will warm up your feet.

706
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:52,220
 So you'll tell if you've got cold feet and it'll go, "Oh no, I'm going to warm up."

707
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,220
 That's incredible.

708
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,220
 How can it tell?

709
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:56,220
 Oh, they're clever robots, aren't they here?

710
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,220
 Yeah, mate.

711
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:59,820
 They're doing some assaults inside you.

712
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:00,820
 They are.

713
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,820
 Oh.

714
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:02,820
 That's the robot for listeners.

715
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,460
 It's a colonoscopy robot.

716
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,460
 Get the word out.

717
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,460
 We don't have time.

718
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,460
 We don't have time.

719
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,460
 Okay, that's it.

720
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,460
 That is all of our facts.

721
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,460
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:12,980

 We have all of our previous episodes up there.

733
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,380
 We also have a book available.

734
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,020
 It's out on November the 2nd.

735
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:35,500
 We're about to give one away to the best fact that we've received from the audience of which

736
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,500
 we have picked.

737
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,500
 James, have you got it?

738
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,500
 Yes.

739
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,780
 The winner is @jessserrax on Twitter.

740
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:48,660
 Her fact is that the Northeast has the greatest variety of ginger hair in the world with 47

741
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:49,660
 shades.

742
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:50,660
 Wow.

743
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,460
 47 shades of ginger.

744
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:58,940
 That is a book that I would definitely be down for.

745
00:34:58,940 --> 00:34:59,940
 Okay.

746
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:00,940
 That's it.

747
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:03,940
 We'll be back again next week with another episode.

748
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,100
 Thank you so much for being here, guys.

749
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,100
 That was really fun.

750
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,100
 We'll see you again.

751
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,100
 Goodbye.

752
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,100
 [Applause]

 [Music]

754
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,680
 (upbeat music)
