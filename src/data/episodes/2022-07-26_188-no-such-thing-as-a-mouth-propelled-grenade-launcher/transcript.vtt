 [CHATTERING]

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.460
 [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.700
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:22.600
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of "No Such Things

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.580
 A Fish A Weekly Podcast" coming to you this week

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.820
 from the stand in Newcastle!

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.680
 [APPLAUSE]

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.820
 I am sitting here with Anne Chazinski, James Harkin,

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.300
 and Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.580
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.340
 to share our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.880
 And now it is time for fact number one.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.620
 And that is James.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.540
 OK, my fact this week is that Mothara has only one Guinness

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.060
 world record.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.980
 And it is in the 100-metre sac race.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.100
 [LAUGHTER]

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.940
 When did I score sports day here with that?

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.700
 I don't know why he did it, but he did it.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.900
 I read an article, and it said, "Mothara needs a world record

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.900
 to seal his place among the old-time greats."

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.220
 And I thought, I'll check if he has one, and he does.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.260
 He has one other one, which is a two-mile indoor run,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.900
 but that's not in the Guinness Book of Records.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.700
 In the Guinness Book of Records, this is the only one.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.260
 And he's about to lose it.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.380
 What, really?

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.220
 Yeah.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.580
 And there's a guy called Stephen Wildish from Rotten.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.580
 And Mothara got 39.91 seconds for his 100 meters.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.220
 And Stephen Wildish has already got 28 seconds, OK?

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.180
 But unfortunately, two weeks after he did it,

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.180
 he got a letter from Guinness saying

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.740
 that to get the world record, he needed a 50 kilogram sac.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.620
 And his sac was only 30 kilograms.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.740
 I thought for a second, you meant the sac had to weigh 50 kilograms.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.660
 And I am amazed, anyone finishes it.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.260
 So anyway, I got in touch with Stephen Wildish.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.140
 And he's going to repeat his attempt next week.

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.420
 And he's really confident that he's definitely going to do it.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.580
 And so that means that by probably the week after this goes out,

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.900
 Mothara will have no Guinness World Records.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.020
 So we snuck in.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.380
 Right, this definitely needs to go out this Friday, James.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.220
 What's the speed that he managed to clock in for the record?

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.780
 So Stephen managed to do it at 28 seconds for the 100 meters.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.460
 So a normal 100 meters form, who say Mothar would be just under 10 seconds.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.260
 So yeah, you know, it's not that fast.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.420
 But it's quite fast.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.660
 And I asked him why.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.020
 I asked Stephen why he was so much better at the sac race than Mothara.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:47.260
 And he says, unlike Mothar, I have little legs, but large calf muscles.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.540
 And I asked him if he has any inspirational words for the people of Newcastle.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:59.580
 And he said, "Inspirational words, always check your sac."

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.020
 Very good.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.700
 A wise man.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.460
 So Mothara, you're saying, has the Guinness World Record for the sac race,

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.020
 but he also has-- but he does have a world record.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.980
 He just has one other world record, but it's not a special Guinness one.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.220
 It's just like a-- just the IWAF or something.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.500
 Yeah, but it's a world record.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.900
 I don't think like when you say bowl gets an Olympic world record, they're going,

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.420
 "Yeah, that's not Guinness World Record, isn't it?"

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.660
 Surely, that's more.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:26.980
 I see what you mean, but it is.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.740
 I mean, it's the two-mile indoor run.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.180
 Yeah, I mean, I'm not putting him down, but why is that many different than an outdoor run?

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.580
 It's more impressive really to have a two-mile long building, frankly.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:44.540
 It's true.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.740
 It's weird though, because on the Guinness Record page for running records,

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.220
 they've really bumped him up, haven't they?

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.500
 He's in the top four.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.460
 I think he's fourth one down, it's the sac race.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:58.020
 So number one is fastest male marathon, number two is fastest female,

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.500
 number three is first to get three records at the Olympics,

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.060
 and number four is sneaks, and then with the sac race.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.300
 And I don't want to put down Guinness Book of Records,

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.980
 but when they said that Stephen Wildish's sac was too small,

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.460
 I kind of think they're a bit upset about Mothara losing this record.

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:14.340
 Yeah.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.540
 They didn't know, but they do have rules about how big the sac is.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:18.460
 They actually do.

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:22.460
 They have one thing, which is if the sac is too big,

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.140
 they notice that people as opposed to like 100 meters long for it to sink.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.140
 Yeah.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:35.260
 But that's the main issue, really, because obviously in a sac race,

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.780
 you're hopping everywhere.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.460
 If you have a slightly larger sac, people actually run inside the sac

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.180
 in order to get there, and that builds up speed in a way.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.260
 You can kind of run, you can put your feet into little corners

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.100
 and do a little kind of wiggly run.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.540
 But the thing is, it used to be in the 19th century in America

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.620
 that each college would have their athletics team,

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.660
 so they'd have a javelin thrower and a 100 meters runner.

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.380
 But they would all also have a sac race guy.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.460
 And this was quite a big deal, and they would train,

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.060
 and they would really try and be awesome at the sac race.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.620
 And some of them would hop, and some of them would run with the feet in the corners.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.540
 And the hoppers were usually better.

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.620
 And the thing is that they came up with a technique of really hopping

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.540
 as far as they could.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.220
 And it was quite ungainly.

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.100
 And sometimes they'd fall over.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.820
 OK.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.260
 But they were so good that when they fell over,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.980
 they sort of did a little somersault and could get back on their feet immediately.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.220
 And they virtually lost no time whatsoever.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:31.660
 Oh, wow.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.780
 And he's anal thing that he was talking about earlier.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.300
 Sorry.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.860
 So for the people listening to this podcast on Friday,

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.140
 and I would hope you'd edit this bit right out.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.900
 No, I don't have a chance.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:50.940
 There's a new robot.

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.020
 We don't have time for this, we don't have time.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.500
 No, we don't have time, no, no.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.620
 People can just imagine what you were thinking about.

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.780
 OK.

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.940
 Do you know there's a 100 meters on all fours world record?

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.100
 Is there?

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.540
 And it's 15.71 seconds.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:08.340
 That's fast.

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.340
 Really?

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:10.740
 They are unbelievably fast.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.860
 The guys who do it, it's so good.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.140
 So it's the same man who's broken the record four times since 2008.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.340
 He's a Japanese guy.

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:26.860
 And to practice, he mops flaws on all fours, which is fun to say, as well as to do.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.420
 How does that help him practice?

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:32.340
 I think he just gets habituated to being on all fours all the time and moving around.

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:33.580
 And he's less likely.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.180
 But it's misrepresentative of the actual purchase you can get on the ground.

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.020
 That would be more useful if he was ice skating.

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.100
 Because then you have the slip of a...

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.220
 It's like training, get altitude, isn't it?

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.660
 Because if you can do it on a slippy floor and then you get on a proper road.

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:47.660
 Yeah.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:48.660
 He's not wrong.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:49.660
 Yeah, he's right.

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:50.660
 He's right.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:54.460
 These stupid sports, like sports day sports, used to be more difficult.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:55.460
 Stupid sports.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.860
 You know, sports that are for the people who aren't sporty at sports day.

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.140
 We've all got a list and I had pole vaults on mine.

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:02.660
 Pole vaults are stupid sports.

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:03.660
 Stupid sport.

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:07.060
 I'm thinking more egg and spoon, the three-legged, all that kind of stuff.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:11.060
 But I was looking them up in the British newspaper archive to see what people used to do

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:12.740
 in the olden days about them.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:17.620
 And it turns out that the egg and spoon race, for instance, used to be done while punting.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.060
 So there was a reference.

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:24.860
 This is, in fact, this is the earliest usage in the OED of egg and spoon.

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:29.260
 It's an 1894 and it said the gentleman had a turn in the egg and spoon race

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:34.060
 in which competitors had to punt with one hand and balance an egg and spoon with another.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.860
 So that is actually much harder, you know, punting for people who aren't

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:40.660
 from Oxford or Cambridge is where you are on a boat standing up and you drop a stick in

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.660
 and you have to power your boat along.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.460
 At the same time, it's carrying an egg and spoon.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:45.460
 Wow.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:48.460
 I thought you meant punting us and putting a bet on with the horses.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:52.060
 No, no, that was strictly forbidden, actually.

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.340
 And the wheelbarrow race was blindfolded.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:58.860
 This was in the 19th century at, for instance, a cubic blindfolded.

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.060
 And wheelbarrows don't have eyes.

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:02.060
 Exactly.

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:05.100
 It's just more realistic.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:06.420
 I think you're both blindfolded.

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:10.020
 So this is for Queen Victoria's Jubilee, there was a huge wheelbarrow race.

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:11.620
 And she didn't participate.

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:12.620
 Sorry, the wheelbarrow.

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:16.820
 Are we talking, we're talking where you're carrying someone's legs and they're moving

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:17.820
 on their hands.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.820
 Not a wheelbarrow, wheelbarrow.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:23.220
 No, no, where there are two people, one of them is pretending to be a wheelbarrow.

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:24.220
 Yeah.

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:27.220
 Yeah, you have to be blindfolded, which makes it a lot more difficult.

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:28.220
 That's you.

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:29.220
 That's nuts.

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:32.220
 Hey, you know that Mofara does the mobot?

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.220
 Oh, yeah.

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:37.860
 It turns out that he's actually being the M from YMCA.

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:43.780
 I said, are you saying that's where he came up with it or just, no, they came, so he does

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:44.780
 that thing.

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:45.780
 He does his mobot.

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:51.020
 And the inspiration from that was he was on a TV show, Claire Bolding and James Corden were

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:53.580
 trying to work out what he should do to celebrate the win.

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:55.780
 And Claire Bolding was the one who invented it.

00:08:55.780 --> 00:09:00.140
 James Corden called it the mobot, but she said it's the M from YMCA.

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:04.740
 If you had someone who'd just done a vault in the gymnastics, stood next to him, you only

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:07.700
 need a C and an A and you've got the whole thing.

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:11.900
 But wait, that's not, it stands for the M of his name.

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:15.980
 I think Claire Bolding was just trying to explain what it looked like to people if they weren't

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:16.980
 watching the TV, right?

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:20.620
 He doesn't do it as a tribute to the YMCA.

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:21.620
 I don't think.

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:23.540
 No, he's plagiarised.

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:27.460
 One of the greatest dancers, Mr Farah's lawyers and listening to big claim, it's not

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:30.460
 one we all support on this show.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:34.700
 Do you know something Mo Farah did do, which is not that cool, actually.

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:39.180
 He has a fellow runner called Chris Thompson and they're good friends in Chris Thompson won

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:43.580
 Silver Medal in Barcelona when Mo won gold a few years ago, I don't know why I'm calling

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:47.300
 him Mo, I don't know him, when Mo Farah won gold a few years ago.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:52.460
 But the first time they ran a race together, Mo Farah said was encouraging him and said,

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:56.340
 "How about we'll run this race, we're going to win it, we'll both run it, we'll hold

00:09:56.340 --> 00:10:00.180
 hands as we run, and then we can cross the finish line at the same time."

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:04.820
 They did it and they held hands for the full race and then with 10 metres to go, Mo Farah

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:09.300
 let go of him, push it aside and sprint to the end of the race.

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:15.980
 The 100 metre record for Egon Spoon Race is, do you think it's more or less than Stephen

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:16.980
 Wildish's?

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:17.980
 28 seconds.

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:18.980
 28 seconds.

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:19.980
 Okay.

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:20.980
 Quicker Rosloas.

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:21.980
 Quicker.

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:22.980
 It is quicker.

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:31.060
 Yeah, it's 16.59 seconds but it was set by Sally Pearson who is a professional 100 metre runner

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:37.020
 or she's a herdler but she's quite famous and she beat a guy called Asherita Firman who

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:39.300
 you guys might recognise, we've mentioned him before.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:45.820
 He has more than 100 world records, mostly in what Anna might call the stupid spots.

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:49.300
 Triple jump.

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:52.100
 I got loads.

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:55.660
 I can't think of many non-stupid spots.

00:10:55.660 --> 00:11:00.860
 Well I reckon he must have been pretty annoyed to have lost his 100 metre Egon Spoon Race because

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:07.860
 the very next month he then broke the 100 metres carrying an Egon Spoon in the mouth record.

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:08.860
 Wow.

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:11.380
 Do you even know that was a sport?

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:14.180
 I suspect it probably wasn't.

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:18.980
 Do you know that the school sport stays a regular feature of the me used to be the pillow fight?

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:22.380
 Now that's a sport.

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:23.380
 How do you win the pillow fight?

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:24.380
 I don't know.

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:25.380
 It didn't actually say.

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:26.380
 I'm sorry where there's article were.

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:27.380
 The winner was just announced.

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:29.860
 We used to play in Australia for sports.

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:34.020
 You would sit on a big wooden pole and you'd each have a pillow and you'd try and whack

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:37.020
 each other off.

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:40.020
 Sorry.

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:44.140
 I wasn't the way you had such a traditional education then.

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:48.180
 OK, it's time for fact number two.

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:49.860
 And that is Andy.

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:56.180
 My fact is that the inside of a Kit Kat is made of more Kit Kat's.

00:11:56.180 --> 00:12:00.420
 Kit Kat's are an infinite recursive loop is what I'm trying to say.

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:01.420
 This is so cool.

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.060
 I mean it can't be true, right?

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:06.780
 Because where did the first Kit Kat insides come from?

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:08.940
 Nobody knows.

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:11.260
 Yeah, this is like a chicken and egg situation isn't it?

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:12.260
 It kind of, yeah.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.100
 So except the eggs are not made of mashed up.

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:19.220
 Chickens.

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:24.740
 Yeah, it's kind of, it's kind of like that.

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:28.980
 So basically during the production process of Kit Kat some of them don't meet the very strict

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:34.740
 criteria for a proper Kit Kat, you know, the wrong shape or they got too many fingers.

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:36.140
 I don't know.

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:43.380
 But anyway, they're wrong and they are, they're rejected and they are ground up and they are

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:48.580
 the filling layer between the wafer bits in a Kit Kat is made of those plus a couple of

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.380
 other things as well, more sugar.

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:53.620
 So yeah, they sit the headlines earlier this year.

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:54.940
 I'd never hit the headlines.

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:58.180
 Sure, it was a slow news day, wasn't it?

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:02.020
 I'd never noticed until you said this fact I looked into it, there was a layer between the

00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:03.020
 wafer and a Kit Kat.

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:05.820
 I just thought it was chocolate around the outside and wafer on the inside.

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:08.060
 Sometimes you get one which is all chocolate.

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:09.060
 Wow.

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:10.060
 Wow.

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:11.060
 It's a good day that I say when you go.

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:12.060
 Have you had one of those?

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:13.060
 Oh, yeah.

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:14.060
 Has anyone else?

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:15.060
 Yeah.

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:17.060
 About half the rum, okay.

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:18.060
 Good.

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:19.060
 Wow.

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:20.060
 Okay.

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:25.500
 You really, honestly, Andy, wait till it happens to you, it's a real life changer.

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:32.540
 But Kit Kat's, I only realise looking into this, what they mean in Japan, which is a lot.

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:33.540
 Everything.

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:34.540
 What do you mean?

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:35.540
 Everything.

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:38.380
 So Japanese people just love Kit Kat's and they've gone way more nuts than we have.

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:44.260
 So apparently, Kit Katzu is a Japanese expression that means surely win, so it basically means

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:45.260
 good luck.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:49.700
 And so because of this coincidence, they're super popular in Japan and they've got loads

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:50.700
 of flavours.

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:54.780
 So they've got more than 300 different Kit Kat flavours in Japan.

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:58.860
 Nestily, they've just built a factory there specifically to make the weird-ass flavours

00:13:58.860 --> 00:13:59.860
 that they have.

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:04.700
 So they have wasabi flavoured Kit Kat, they have soy sauce flavour, they have sushi flavoured

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:05.700
 Kit Kat.

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:07.500
 What do you guys, you haven't tried it?

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:08.500
 That's right.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:09.500
 They're not going to enjoy it.

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:14.500
 They have, in Japan, made a Kit Kat which doubles up as a postcard and you can just put it

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:19.380
 in the post to someone because every year about half the children doing their exams get sent

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:22.020
 a Kit Kat for good luck because of that surely win thing.

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:26.820
 So Kit Kat invented a one that's a postcard and you can just send it to someone, just put

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:31.260
 a Kit Kat into the letterbox, you did it, you'd be arrested.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:36.140
 We're only one envelope away from that.

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:43.860
 Yeah, but you know that Kit Kat started out as Mutton Pies.

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.500
 This is true.

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:57.380
 So there was a club in London called the Kit Kat Club and it was, it was run by an innkeeper

00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:02.740
 called Christopher Kat, who was called Kit Kat and every, all the literary figures of

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:07.860
 time used to go there and he would serve them Mutton Pies which they called a Kit Kat.

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:13.100
 And so the idea is that that just became a name of a popular food source and then eventually

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:14.380
 it turned into Kit Kat.

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:22.420
 No one has acknowledged that this is true, but the Kit Kat Club, the Kit Kat Club is definitely

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:23.420
 true.

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:24.420
 It's definitely true.

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:25.420
 It's association as well.

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:26.420
 Yeah, yeah.

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:29.460
 So the original Kit Kat definitely was Mutton Pies but get this, the ceilings were so low

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:33.060
 in the Kit Kat Club that they were beautiful establishments.

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:37.980
 So what they, what they did was have paintings all over the club but because the ceilings

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:43.820
 were so low, they needed to get paintings that were longer on the, well on landscape rather

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:45.220
 than portrait.

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:50.460
 And there's a theory that the reason that Kit Kat so shaped like they are is because they're

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:54.940
 paying tribute to the squatty paintings of the Kit Kat Club in London.

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:58.060
 Sorry, I didn't realise when he said no one's acknowledge this is true, you were talking

00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:04.580
 about the thing you were about to say.

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:06.580
 You know the Kit Kat slogan?

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:07.580
 I have a break.

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:08.580
 Have a break.

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:09.580
 Have a break.

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:10.580
 I only got that yesterday.

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:11.660
 That's a pun.

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:17.860
 I didn't realise it was a reference to Kit Kat's breaking.

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:19.540
 I thought it was just like, you know, yeah, a break or what?

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:20.540
 I didn't get the other meaning.

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:21.540
 And they only called that.

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:22.540
 Did everyone get that?

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:23.540
 No, no, no.

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:24.540
 No.

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:25.780
 Of course everyone fucking got it.

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:34.020
 As far as if the slogan writer's going to be at a time going finally.

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:35.020
 Was it too obtuse?

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:36.260
 What was I doing that was wrong?

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:39.060
 Sorry, can I join Anna's Club of people who didn't get it?

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:40.060
 Sorry, sorry.

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:46.500
 In the, in the advert, they break it, as they say, have a break.

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.500
 I didn't, I know.

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:50.260
 I know, I know.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:51.260
 We know all the clues were there, James.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:52.260
 Some sort of two things.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:56.820
 And it only came about in the 50s when they toughened up the materials that they made Kit Kat's

00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:00.580
 from, and they were very proud of the new snapping sound that it made.

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:03.580
 And so actually the crucial thing about it is the breaking sound.

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:09.860
 Look who suddenly the expert on the etymology and the standing of the slogan.

00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:11.180
 I have a fact about chocolate.

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:12.180
 OK.

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:16.620
 The average chocolate bar is about 20 to 25% fat, 40 to 50% sugar, right?

00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:18.820
 So it's one gram of fat to two grams of sugar, right?

00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:19.820
 OK.

00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:24.260
 It's very unusual in nature to find those ratios of sugar and fat together.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.180
 So if you have nuts, they have lots of fat, but no sugar.

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:31.540
 If you have fruit, loads of sugar, but no fat, there is a theory that the reason we like

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:37.260
 chocolate is because the place you find that same ratio, one gram fat, two gram of sugar,

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:38.260
 is breast milk.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:39.260
 Oh.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:40.260
 No way.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:43.100
 Yeah, 4% fat, 8% sugar.

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:45.540
 So it may be that we are trying to recreate.

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:46.540
 No.

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:48.540
 No.

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:50.540
 Are earliest.

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:51.540
 Yeah.

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:53.540
 Come for food.

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:54.540
 That's what's happening.

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:59.580
 Why do you think the Terry's chocolate orange is so successful?

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:00.580
 I don't know.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:01.580
 Why?

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:10.420
 Because you were breastfed by an umpa-lumpa, and you're trying to get back to that.

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:11.420
 Wait, don't.

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:13.340
 The Terry's chocolate orange isn't orange.

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:15.660
 You know you have to take the wrapping off.

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:18.300
 I found a really cool thing.

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:23.060
 I was looking into how they test chocolate, and it led me down a little road that got me

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:28.420
 to MacVitties and all sorts of just how they, they, for candies and biscuits and chocolate

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:29.700
 biscuits and stuff.

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:36.660
 And um, there's a dummy that tests crumb uh, looseage once you're biting into it.

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:40.460
 So it's a robot dummy that just bites, got plastic teeth.

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:45.580
 It's called a crumb test dummy, and the idea is that MacVitties have a laboratory where

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:52.580
 they put it into its mouth and it just goes up and the advantage is that it never stops

00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:56.460
 doing that because it doesn't need to breathe because Andy, what is it?

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:57.460
 The robot.

00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:58.460
 Yes.

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:02.860
 It's a bit like the anal thing you were talking about.

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:04.860
 No.

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:06.420
 Do we need to move on to the next fact?

00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:07.420
 Yeah, we do actually.

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:13.420
 We do need to move on to the next fact, um, sorry Andy to cut you off again, try to get

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:15.420
 to it before the end of the show.

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:19.380
 Um, and now it is time for fact number three and that is Chazinski.

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:25.980
 Yeah, my fact this week is that the first hamsters to come to the UK arrived in a coat pocket.

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:26.980
 Oh.

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:27.980
 I know.

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:28.980
 So sweet.

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:34.740
 The story of hamsters is really interesting.

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:41.220
 So um, basically there was a scientist called, don't be skeptical, there was a scientist

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:46.340
 called Saul Adler back in the 1920s, 1930s and he decided that hamsters would be similar,

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:51.420
 were similar enough to humans that they might serve as useful lab animals for obvious reasons

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:54.380
 that I don't need to go into hamsters humans, basically the same.

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:59.780
 Um, and he, no, he specifically wanted to try out stuff that might cure parasitic diseases

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:00.860
 on them.

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:04.820
 And so he brought three hamsters back from Syria in 1931.

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:09.340
 So all the pet hamsters that you have had in your childhoods and that you've ever seen

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:14.740
 are all descended, um, from the, this tiny batch of Syrian hamsters that these guys found

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:16.540
 in the 1930s.

00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:19.380
 And yeah, he smuggled these guys back in his coat pocket.

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:23.500
 And didn't he smuggle them, I might be thinking of a different person, but didn't he smuggle

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:27.940
 them back in the coat pocket because they ate their way out of the box that they were

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:28.940
 in?

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:29.940
 Yes.

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:30.940
 It's a really exciting story.

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:31.940
 Yeah.

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:32.940
 Yeah.

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:33.940
 It is.

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:36.140
 No, they got, they got a dozen, didn't they just start?

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:37.140
 Yeah.

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:41.060
 And then the mother started, the mother killed one of the babies, so then they had 10 less.

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:42.060
 Okay, fine.

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:44.540
 And then half of them escaped and had to be recaptured.

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:48.660
 And then they put them in a wooden box and they chewed through that and then were recaptured.

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:50.860
 It's like the great escape, but with hamsters.

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:55.220
 And that was with, the guy was called Israel Aheroni, wasn't he?

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:58.740
 Who, he was the guy who was determined that he'd get these hamsters.

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:00.940
 And it sounds like his life depended on it.

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:04.020
 Um, when, when these five escaped, he was absolutely devastated.

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:06.180
 He said he was shaken to his depths.

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:11.620
 And imagine, yeah, when the mother ate her children and then he had three left and then I think,

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:14.820
 uh, oh no, yeah, one, one sibling ate another.

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:17.420
 And then he had to make the brother and sister, didn't he, that was nice.

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:18.420
 Yes.

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:19.420
 So they're all products of incest?

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:20.420
 No.

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:21.420
 No.

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:22.420
 All your childhood hamsters?

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:23.420
 Yeah.

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:24.420
 Incest.

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:28.340
 That's actually one of, that's one of the reasons they're so useful, uh, because they're

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:32.220
 similarity to humans is genuinely because they're very susceptible to heart disease

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:36.140
 hamsters, um, as susceptible as humans and also that's why they're quite good to study.

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:38.980
 And the reason they're susceptible is because they're all very imbred.

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:39.980
 Really?

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:40.980
 Yeah, apparently so.

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:41.980
 Wow.

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:47.740
 The thing is about, um, hamsters is it's really weird why they become popular pets really because

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:50.100
 they only live for a couple of years.

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:51.100
 Tick?

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:52.100
 Yeah.

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:53.100
 [laughter]

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:57.940
 That is a certain comfort, James, in knowing this is a short-term contract.

00:21:57.940 --> 00:21:58.940
 Yeah.

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:04.380
 Well, they don't like being handled, you know, they're nocturnal.

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:06.660
 Oh, during the day they don't do anything.

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:07.660
 Are they nocturnal?

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:10.660
 I read that they, well, in the wild, they're definitely nocturnal.

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:13.340
 Both of mine as a child were nocturnal.

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:15.500
 They just don't want to hang out with you, man.

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:16.500
 [laughter]

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:17.500
 I read as well that they're...

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:20.020
 It's because I get pointed at them and saying incest.

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:21.020
 [laughter]

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:22.180
 You should be ashamed.

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:23.180
 Yeah.

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:24.180
 Clocks, ticking boys.

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:25.180
 [laughter]

00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:26.180
 You have two months left.

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:28.220
 I've had mobile phone contracts longer than you.

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:30.220
 [laughter]

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:37.380
 I've heard that you can...that they are able to drink alcohol because they hold...they

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:39.220
 hold things...what is it?

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:43.700
 They hold stuff in their cheeks for so long and then they hoard them, and they don't eat

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:47.140
 them too much later, but then it ferments and it turns into alcohol, so they've had to turn

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:52.300
 their digestive system into one that can just downboose really quickly and not die, which

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:55.940
 a lot of animals can't do, and these are serum on from Newcastle, basically.

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:56.940
 [laughter]

00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:00.460
 Risky.

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:01.980
 The pouches are amazing, though.

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:04.620
 They're cheeks stretch back to their hips when they need them too.

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:05.620
 What?

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:08.820
 Yeah, they basically go and run down the whole length of their body, and they switch off

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:13.140
 their saliva glands to stop themselves accidentally metabolising the food that they want

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:17.700
 to store, so they stop making saliva until they feel hungry and then they start making

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:18.700
 again.

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:22.460
 I read one thing that said that they can put enough stuff in their cheeks that will make

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:24.460
 their heads triple in size.

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:25.460
 [laughter]

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:26.460
 What?

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:31.060
 Well, I looked at the size of the hamsters head and did a bit of working out, and basically

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:36.580
 it's the equivalent of me fitting a large tin of paint in my mouth.

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:37.580
 [laughter]

00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:41.620
 And ladies and gentlemen, we're off finale tonight.

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:42.620
 [laughter]

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:49.420
 I think that's why they were called saddlebags, right, so when they first went to Syria to find

00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:53.980
 them, they realised the Arabic word for them, translated as Mr. saddlebags, so they called

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:54.980
 hamsters.

00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:56.980
 Well, I'm not sure why, but I assume that must be it.

00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:57.980
 I think that is it.

00:23:57.980 --> 00:23:58.980
 Yeah.

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:00.980
 Have you heard of America's Hamster King?

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:01.980
 No.

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:02.980
 He's a great guy.

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:06.580
 He's the guy who popularised the hamster across the whole of the USA.

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:10.540
 He's a guy from Mobile, Alabama, and his name was Albert F. Marsh.

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:17.060
 And so I think in the early 50s, but I might be wrong, might be 40s, he took one hamster

00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:20.620
 on as a payment of a $1 gambling debt.

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:22.980
 That was how the debt to him was paid off in a hamster.

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:23.980
 Right.

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:28.580
 He must have got another one from somewhere because he then breathed them.

00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:33.140
 But within three years, he was making the equivalent of $1.8 million a year, just from sending

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:37.300
 hamsters out to people, and the way he built this business, it was a huge business.

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:39.300
 He can't have been making that much money.

00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:40.300
 How much was he charging this time?

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:41.300
 He made him...

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:46.460
 I think he charged about $9, no, it's about $9, which would have been a lot more then.

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:47.460
 But this is incredible.

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:51.220
 So he built the business up and he made it absolutely massive really quickly, and his

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:56.700
 shipping method was to send a hamster to the address you wanted it sent to in a coffee

00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:58.540
 can with a potato.

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:04.500
 The potato was for it to eat and drink along the way, and it would arrive, and you would

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:07.700
 have a hamster and then no potato in a coffee tin.

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:16.460
 That is worse than Ryanair food, I've got to say, one potato, come on.

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:23.460
 I was reading that, so the idea of him bringing these bunch of hamsters in his coat pocket,

00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:26.620
 I suddenly thought that's the idea of smuggling things in.

00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:31.220
 I think I slightly misread the fact thinking it was smuggling in, but so I looked up smuggling,

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:34.100
 and that's where we're going now.

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:37.740
 But I was a story that happened just this year, and I'm so upset that it's not made it

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:41.100
 into the book, because it would have been perfect.

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:47.360
 A woman was arrested in Venezuela after several guards caught her trying to break her boyfriend

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:53.420
 out of jail by smuggling him out in the suitcase that she brought in with her.

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:56.760
 So she went in with her daughter, and she just had, "Oh, I've just got my suitcase with

00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:57.760
 me."

00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:01.860
 During the visit, while the guards were away, she opened it up, he got inside, they zipped

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:05.660
 him up, and then she tried to just walk out again with him, and she got quite far, but

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:10.380
 then she started struggling with the suitcase, and so they laid it down and they opened it

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:17.420
 up, and inside was a squished boyfriend, who, yeah, that is not the only person in suitcase

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:20.680
 crime story that has come from this year, from this year.

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:21.680
 No, yes.

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:27.260
 In the last week, there was a guy, I think in India, who was arrested, because he had been

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:33.480
 committed crime by getting himself loaded into luggage holds in a bag, and then he would

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:38.060
 get out of the bag, rob all the other bags in the luggage hold, and then get back into

00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:39.060
 his bag.

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:40.060
 Oh, yes.

00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:44.420
 Wait, how could he put everything in his bag with him?

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:46.580
 I think he might have, he might have just left at that point.

00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:47.580
 No.

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:51.780
 Well, he might have just stolen small things, but imagine on that carousel, if you accidentally

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:55.380
 pick up the wrong bag, there's a small Indian man.

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:56.380
 Is this mine?

00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:58.140
 No, that's not mine.

00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:01.620
 All right, let's move on to our final fact.

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:05.500
 Okay, it's time for a final fact of the show, and that is my fact.

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:10.900
 My fact this week is that an effective way to treat snoring is to regularly play the

00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:13.260
 didgeridoo.

00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:14.260
 This has been done.

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:16.820
 It's been proven by scientists to work.

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:18.540
 No, listen, owing for the partner, is it?

00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:21.100
 When you come home, you're like, darling, I've got fantastic news.

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:22.100
 I found a cure.

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:26.300
 I'm just going to constantly play the didgeridoo for the rest of our lives.

00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:29.420
 Instead of sleeping, I will be in bed next to you, playing the didgeridoo.

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:31.740
 You won't even notice any snoring.

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:37.460
 Yeah, they did this as a test, they had 25 patients who all suffer from chronic snoring.

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:42.860
 They're 18 years old onwards, so they usually snoring affects people much older, but they

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:45.260
 wanted to start a younger age.

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:49.900
 And they had the more practice a didgeridoo for 5.9 days a per week.

00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:55.660
 That's how it worked out, for 25.3 minutes per session.

00:27:55.660 --> 00:28:01.660
 And they found a remarkable recovery process of the nasal passage for when you're sleeping

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:05.980
 that you no longer were snoring either as intensely or at all.

00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:10.660
 So if anyone here in the audience is a snorer, get yourself to Australia.

00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:14.980
 It's a bit expensive, that's where they sell them, and yeah, start playing.

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:17.260
 So I found out about this a few years ago.

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:21.420
 I went on to the QI forums, which is where we do the research for the TV show, and I look

00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:25.900
 for didgeridoo, and it turns out I'd post about this in 2006, which is when the report came

00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:26.900
 out.

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:33.180
 I suggested a question for QI, which was, how does Roll Paris sleep at night?

00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:44.140
 We passed the bullet there, right?

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:45.940
 Oh my god.

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:47.420
 I actually own a didgeridoo.

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:48.420
 No you don't.

00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:49.420
 Promise?

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:51.020
 I was given it as a present for my 16th birthday.

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:52.020
 Can you play it?

00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:53.020
 No.

00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:54.020
 It's very hard to play.

00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:55.020
 Yeah.

00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:56.020
 I've only got one note out of it.

00:28:56.020 --> 00:29:00.820
 And you need a circular breathing the whole way through, which I can't do.

00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:04.500
 And I read that when the way that they get different sounds, it's all to do with the way

00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:06.540
 that you shape your lip once it's inside.

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:11.780
 So in the way that if you were saying words like, hello, hello, hello, that would be like,

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:15.660
 oh, and then if you're like, wow, wow, wow, wow, wait, do you put your lips inside?

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:17.500
 I think your lips go inside the different way.

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:18.500
 I see now.

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:26.620
 Because it stretches to the mouth, unbelievably.

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:30.660
 How do these guys do it?

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:36.740
 This explains my short-lived trumpet career as well.

00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:41.340
 But it is a circular breathing, right?

00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:42.980
 That means it can cure snoring.

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:43.980
 Is that the answer?

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:44.980
 Yeah, I'm guessing.

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:45.980
 I think it is.

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:50.500
 The strength and your whole respiratory tract, you know, it just makes everything stronger

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:51.500
 in the whole.

00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:52.500
 Yeah.

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:53.500
 Yes.

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:54.500
 And snoring is very problematic.

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:59.100
 Apparently a third of people in relationships cite snoring as a problem in their relationship.

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:00.100
 I thought.

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:01.100
 In Finland.

00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:02.100
 Maybe they snore a little bit.

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:03.100
 I know that.

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:05.100
 I have snoring.

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:06.100
 Bad.

00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:07.100
 I have bad snoring.

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:08.100
 Yeah.

00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:09.100
 I'm talking.

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:10.100
 Yeah.

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:15.900
 And I talk to my wife about it every morning, because I'm like, was it bad?

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:21.260
 Last night with my snoring, and was it bad for you last night?

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:23.660
 And she's always, she's like, no, I really like it.

00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:27.220
 It's really, it's God, you're a lucky man.

00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:28.220
 I do.

00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:29.740
 Or I've married a freak.

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:31.180
 I don't know what it's going.

00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:35.380
 But she says, because it's consistent, you know, it has a rhythm.

00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:40.180
 It feels like, you know, you're out at sea or, you know, there's a...

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:42.500
 I think I have a very pleasurable snore.

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:47.660
 Did you know that she is suffering more than you are probably, so when snoring is cured,

00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:52.700
 people's partner's quality of life in proves more than the snores quality of life.

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:57.060
 And apparently the partners of snores wake up on average 21 times an hour.

00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:58.060
 What?

00:30:58.060 --> 00:30:59.060
 What?

00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:00.060
 Yeah.

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:03.900
 Like a little bit, you know, like you send me wake up and then you fall back to sleep.

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:04.900
 Wow.

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:05.900
 That's amazing.

00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:06.900
 That's amazing.

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:07.900
 I'm sorry.

00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:09.140
 Well, no, it's about didry days.

00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:13.100
 But it is about didry days.

00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:14.740
 All right, didry days.

00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:18.220
 This is just a story that was in the BBC news website.

00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:19.220
 It's from a few years ago.

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:20.220
 It's from 2004.

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:24.620
 And the story is, "Attendling train driver calls two terror alerts when he mistook a didry

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:26.820
 do for a grenade launcher."

00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:36.060
 He's a train driver in London and he reported that he had seen a man carrying a grenade launcher.

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:40.020
 And other passengers said the man fitting the driver's description of the suspect had

00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:42.060
 been there, but only had a didry do.

00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:43.060
 Right.

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:44.300
 That happened in the morning.

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:52.540
 Then later the same day, the same driver reported seeing the man taking aim at love production.

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:56.500
 And the terror police said, "This time we found the man with the didry do."

00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:00.300
 He added, "The driver was quite right to inform us about what he genuinely thought was

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:04.540
 a terrorist threat on both occasions, which is you can't really say anything else.

00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:05.540
 Can you?"

00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:06.540
 If you're an idiot.

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:07.540
 Don't phone in.

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:08.540
 You can't say that.

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:13.060
 He must have been so annoying with the second time calling, saying, "I can't believe you

00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:16.780
 guys were irresponsible enough not to catch him at the first time round, and I'm having

00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:17.780
 to tell you again."

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:22.580
 The traditional mouth-launched grenade launcher.

00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:28.300
 I was trying to work out, actually, because didry do is obviously very long, very wide,

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:33.500
 how they hollow out the inside of a didry do, so I started googling it and couldn't

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:34.500
 find anything.

00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:35.500
 Yeah.

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:36.500
 Turmites do it.

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:37.500
 Not really.

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:38.500
 Yeah.

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:39.500
 They train turmites.

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:40.500
 Turmites.

00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:41.500
 No.

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:44.220
 They're kind of naturally occurring, aren't they?

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:48.460
 So you get a big bit of eucalyptus and the turmites live inside and they eat all the inside

00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:51.100
 bit and then you can cut it off and you've got naturally occurring.

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:54.540
 So you have to wait for a didry do to naturally occur before?

00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:56.580
 Yeah, but it's not like a long way.

00:32:56.580 --> 00:33:00.580
 It's not like people buy, like, filled in planks of wood and then they sit there staring

00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:01.580
 at it.

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:02.580
 They're just in the wild.

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:09.140
 But I mean, it's like we're just we're taking wild instruments and bringing them, like we're

00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:10.340
 not even making them.

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:15.540
 We're just finding them in the wild, taking them from their habitat and then sticking our

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:17.540
 mouth right around the rim of them.

00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:19.980
 Okay, we're going to have to wrap up at a sec.

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:22.020
 If you guys got anything more before we do?

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:23.780
 There's a bed you can buy.

00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:25.020
 It's like a robotic bed.

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:26.020
 Oh.

00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:27.020
 Oh.

00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:28.020
 Like my um...

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:29.020
 A rattle thing.

00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:30.020
 Yeah.

00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:31.020
 Yeah.

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:32.020
 Yeah.

00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:35.100
 But anyway, this is amazing.

00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:40.380
 It has sensors in it and it can tell when you're snoring and then it kind of just moves you

00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:43.380
 very slowly into a better position so you won't snore.

00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:44.380
 Oh.

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:45.380
 That is not incredible.

00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:48.260
 And it also will warm up your feet.

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:52.220
 So you'll tell if you've got cold feet and it'll go, "Oh no, I'm going to warm up."

00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:53.220
 That's incredible.

00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:54.220
 How can it tell?

00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:56.220
 Oh, they're clever robots, aren't they here?

00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:57.220
 Yeah, mate.

00:33:57.220 --> 00:33:59.820
 They're doing some assaults inside you.

00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:00.820
 They are.

00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:01.820
 Oh.

00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:02.820
 That's the robot for listeners.

00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:04.460
 It's a colonoscopy robot.

00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:05.460
 Get the word out.

00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:06.460
 We don't have time.

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:07.460
 We don't have time.

00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:08.460
 Okay, that's it.

00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:09.460
 That is all of our facts.

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:10.460

 We also have a book available.

00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:32.020
 It's out on November the 2nd.

00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:35.500
 We're about to give one away to the best fact that we've received from the audience of which

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:36.500
 we have picked.

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:37.500
 James, have you got it?

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:38.500
 Yes.

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:41.780
 The winner is @jessserrax on Twitter.

00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:48.660
 Her fact is that the Northeast has the greatest variety of ginger hair in the world with 47

00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:49.660
 shades.

00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:50.660
 Wow.

00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:52.460
 47 shades of ginger.

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:58.940
 That is a book that I would definitely be down for.

00:34:58.940 --> 00:34:59.940
 Okay.

00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:00.940
 That's it.

00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:03.940
 We'll be back again next week with another episode.

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:05.100
 Thank you so much for being here, guys.

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:06.100
 That was really fun.

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:07.100
 We'll see you again.

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:08.100
 Goodbye.
