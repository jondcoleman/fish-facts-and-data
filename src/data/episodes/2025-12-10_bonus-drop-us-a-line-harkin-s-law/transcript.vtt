00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.040
 Hey Andy. Hi everybody. Hi Andy. Hi everybody. Welcome to Drops Alina. Audience, feedback

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:32.520
 show. Welcome to all of you whether you're listening or watching. We are recording this in the QI offices in

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.560
 Hoban. My name is Andrew Hunter Murray here at Dan Shriver in James Harkin. I didn't need to do this

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.160
 bit. Do I? Everyone's already knows what we do. Yeah. It's nice to remind people. It's nice to remind

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.000
 people. If you're a first time at Drops Alina, welcome. We've got some tasty treats that we're going to

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.640
 dish up now. This is the worst in about 40 shows. This is the worst I've ever done it. So far.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.760
 It was about average for you. Thank you very much. I thought you were going strong there actually.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.200
 Okay. Well, we've had a busy old time in the inbox. Great. The inbox is bulging. Yes. Let's have

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.840
 some of the best emails from the last couple of weeks. So here is this is big hook time which

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.600
 is a new thing I've introduced. Okay. This is where we specifically me in this case. I've got

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.360
 something genuinely wrong and it pains me. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Adam Webb writes. It pains me to write

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.920
 this email. Oh, it's pained everyone. Oh, this is the worst case scenario. I know. I was listening

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.040
 to the recent episode with Rachel Paris. Unfortunately, believe there has been an error. Uh-oh. And he

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.120
 claimed there were sandwiches at the Boston Tea Party. Okay. I'm with this. Yeah. Because the

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.240
 Earl of Sandwich was there and in fairness to you, you were told this by someone else. This was a

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.160
 format inbox message. Yes, but I then looked it up. And anyway, as someone who recently moved to

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.720
 Boston, I was thrilled. I couldn't wait to use this silly fact to endear myself to the Bostonians.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.280
 But I did a little digging and I believe the source of this fact may have mixed up their John Montague's.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.840
 So two people called John Montague. Who would have thought? I know. The Earl of Sandwich was most

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.640
 likely in London at the time. And there are detailed correspondence records showing that it's not

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:19.760
 at the Boston Tea Party. So either Sandwich invented air travel and told no one. Very funny, Adam.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.880
 Or he was most likely just not in Boston. Oh, wow. It's a fair point. Or he had someone doing his

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.920
 correspondence. Well, there was someone a second John Montague in Boston. Okay. So scratch that. Yep.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.840
 Who was the great, great grandson of the first Earl of Manchester. Fun fact. And head of Britain's

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.600
 North American fleet. And he wrote two letters from Boston. So he was probably there to witness

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.120
 the BTP or Boston Tea Party. So I'm so sorry, Adam. I'm sorry, everyone. I'm really fluffed that. Great.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.040
 Digging, though, Mr. Webb. Really good digging. Yeah. Yeah. Really nice. Here's an I'm actually

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.760
 from Safia Flurry. Great name. A little correctional addition to the fact sent in by Edward Maloy

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.880
 Norwich is the only city in history to be excommunicated. Oh, yeah. We had this on a little fish.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.320
 Yes, it was. They trashed the church or something. And the Pope said, you're not coming back into

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:16.240
 the church until you fix it. And they never did. Well, Safia just says it's the only English city

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.960
 excommunicated. Okay. It's a little, I'm actually a little bit of bonus stuff to lose Venice,

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:28.320
 Bologna and Florence, Bologna and Florence. And also the Spanish village of Trasmoth.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:36.960
 Don't ride it. Because I said it perfectly. In northern Spain, was excommunicated in 1511,

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:42.320
 ostensibly for its tolerance of witchcraft. Pope Julius II placed a curse on the town.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.320
 That doesn't seem right. Okay. It's quite spicy for a Pope, isn't it, to be going around

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.360
 placing curses? Yeah. It feels like you're allowed to not pray for people. It doesn't feel like

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.480
 you're allowed to curse. What was the curse? Do we know? No, but apparently, I don't think we do,

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.800
 but apparently it's never been officially lifted. Does it need a Pope to lift it? Maybe. Yeah, I don't

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:09.520
 think you can just lift it. Definitely overreaching, if you're going to say, yeah, that thing that that

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.560
 Pope did doesn't count anymore. That's right. Should we do it now? I think if all three of us do it,

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.960
 lift the curse on Trasmoth. Lifto. Well, I feel like it's not going to work until we learn how to

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:27.280
 pronounce the name of the sound point. I think whoever is up there in the sort of decided who's

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.560
 cursed and who isn't cursed is going to get very confused. It's very unclear. It's very unclear.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.400
 But I mentioned this email in particular because of Safi's last point, which is that it played to

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.960
 their advantage because rumors of ghostly spirits kept officials away when the townspeople began

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:49.040
 counter-fitting coins. That's funny. Today it holds an annual witchcraft festival and the village's

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:55.920
 other attraction is a monument to Manuel Halon Corominas, supposed inventor of the mop and bucket.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:05.200
 Wow. Now, question. Did he invent the mop and the bucket? Or did someone else invent the mop?

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.040
 Someone else invented the bucket and he just bought the two tickets. You're right. You're right.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.520
 You're all the sandwich only brought together the bread and the cheese and the ham. What happened

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.400
 was, James? He had a mop and he tripped and fell one day while holding it and it fell into a little

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:24.160
 depression in the ground where it had rained overnight and that led to him accidentally discovering the

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.960
 bucket. Wow. Isn't that great? What an ending to an email as well. An ending.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.840
 Right. We come to our fortnightly Hooters correspondent section.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:44.640
 So what happened was I came up the idea of starting a restaurant with soft core pornography

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.360
 on the screens because then people would pay less attention to the food. Someone said, James,

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:57.360
 you've invented Hooters and now a third person has stuck their aura in. We, I think, said that we

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:03.200
 could open Hooters in the UK. And we were unsure about whether there already was a Hooters in the UK.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:10.720
 We've had some clarifications. Asha Goff says, "The first ever Hooters in the UK opened in Nottingham.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:16.240
 It has moved to the other side of the street since then and was opened by Catherine Ryan."

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:21.120
 Oh, yeah. Catherine used to work. I thought she worked there in Canada, but so that was the UK.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.600
 I think she did. No, no. She worked there in Canada. Then came over here, became a celebrity and then

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:32.640
 was invited to open a new store. Okay. Well, actually, no. She worked as one of the Hooters in Canada.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:37.760
 Waitresses. No, in the UK in Nottingham, but she wasn't officially opening it because then she was not

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:44.960
 a famous long time ago. So she is in the PR images, but it's not like Catherine Ryan's opening Hooters.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.320
 It's more we're opening a Hooters here, all the staff, and one of them is Catherine Ryan.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:53.680
 Only one Hooters in the UK? Jade Milton adds. There are additional Hooters in Newcastle and Liverpool.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:58.960
 Right. So we're up to at least three and it's one of those, I think we draw a line under the

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:04.000
 Hooters chat now. Yeah, if you know of another town which has a Hooters, don't write in because that's

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.440
 easily good, good level information. If you've worked there and you have something important to add,

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:14.800
 do write in. Yes, yes, yes, if I've got it wrong about Catherine Ryan and when she became famous

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:21.680
 enough that she could open a branch of Hooters in her own right, please do, please do write in. All right.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:32.160
 Do you want a rodeo clown or a secret squid? Yeah, rodeo clown is the big, that's the big meat.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:39.440
 The big meat, the big, which used to be called big meat in the show. What a secret squid.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:45.040
 That's a new thing I've created for this week. Okay. It's a secret person. You're going to get these

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:49.840
 both. It's which order do you want them? Let's go for the big subject. Okay. It's rodeo clown time.

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:55.760
 I'm going to read an email from Diana Quick and she represents, I would say, at least 35 people

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:59.040
 in the fish on box at the moment. Okay. Is that her name or are you going to read it fast?

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:05.840
 Very good. Very good. She's called Diana Quick. Thank you. I'm expecting you've probably had

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:12.000
 lots of messages about this. We have Diana. We have. But in case not, on the most recent episode of

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.360
 Little Fish, Lauren Kramer sent an effect that landlocked Oklahoma had more shoreline than the

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:23.760
 contiguous USA hosts poo pooed this because of the long coastline of Alaska. I think one host in

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:27.680
 particular did the poo pooing. It's very nice of you to throw yourself off that, James. It was done.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:37.280
 However, Alaska is not one of the contiguous states, the lower 48, which is all 50 bar Hawaii and

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:42.080
 Alaska. So the fact may still be incorrect, but not for the reason stated. So you sent me this and

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:46.800
 warned me that this was going to happen. And I think the Oklahoma fact has sent him by Lauren is

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:52.560
 correct now. I believe because I managed to find the actual lengths of all the different coastlines.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:09:01.200
 And the official length of all the shorelines in Oklahoma. And I think it's just a mere culper.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:09.280
 It's a mistake. Mistaking continental for contiguous and I shouldn't really have done that because

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:19.600
 I think I failed to say the word contiguous about five times. But I also think the problem was,

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:24.880
 and this is something we find on QI all the time, is when you are pedantically correcting someone else's

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:29.200
 fact, that is always when you're likely to make a mistake. You're painting that target on your back.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:36.160
 Is that like Murphy's laws a term for things? Anything that can be wrong. We'll go wrong. What's this?

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:41.280
 What's the QI law? Well, I thought I might call it Harkins law. But I think one of the problems with

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:47.360
 that episode was I called the episode you've been Harkin, which almost doubled down. James, almost

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:52.640
 almost every one of the 35 emails we've had so far has contained in the subject lines some reference

00:09:52.640 --> 00:10:00.160
 to, no, you've been Harkin. You Harkin yourself. Harkin gets Harkin. It's a fair play. Fair play. So, you know,

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:06.560
 we don't get everything right. Like nobody does. I think it might be, it's not clear, right? What

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:12.160
 the really interesting thing is why Oklahoma has such a large number of lakes. And it's all because

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:20.000
 they built constructed hundreds of man-made lakes, mostly in the 1930s, because they'd had the dust

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.480
 bowl. And there was a thing called the Federal Flood Act in 1936, you could get money for building

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:28.960
 dams and reservoirs and hydroelectric power, all of this. So that is the reason it's this huge

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:35.200
 boom of construction of fake lakes. Is this what the musicals about? It must be. I can't imagine

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:39.840
 something more interesting, but this musical to be about. Also, we had someone writing in saying,

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:45.760
 actually, if you count all the rivers in Oklahoma as shoreline, and at that point, I didn't say no, hang on,

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:51.120
 like we did make a mistake, but absolutely not. Yeah. No one says I went to the coast. Which rid of

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:56.560
 the coast? Did you go to? Oh, just the river. Come on. No, mate. Yeah. Let's take it easy. Anyway,

00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:02.080
 I think one of the problems I had is that a lot of the ways that this fact is worded are wrong.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:07.440
 Right. So when you go online and you search it, you get loads of websites of people saying,

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:11.840
 ah, this thing about Oklahoma, where they say we have more shoreline than any of the state. So,

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:18.000
 for instance, lots of other states have lots of lakes. So, you know, that kind of works out. So lots of

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.320
 the ways that it's phrased are not true, but I think the way that Lauren phrased it, I think,

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:25.680
 is true. I think it's right. Apologies, Lauren. Did you find the website Oklahoma Myths?

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.760
 That was a good one. Yes, I did. Yeah. It was good, wasn't it? Yeah, yeah.

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:32.400
 Right. Now you've eaten your greens. It's time for the secret squid pudding.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:39.040
 Okay. What's the secret squid mean? It's people who are working in secret environments,

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:43.680
 who are getting in touch. And we've had a few of these. We had someone listening,

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:48.880
 no, reading your book down on a nuclear submarine. Yes, we had someone. It's worrying the people

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:57.040
 who are in charge of nuclear submarines. Yeah, it's all just going out. Fire the torpedo.

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:02.160
 We spot it like we're now at war with Russia. Fire the tornado. Now that someone's there reading,

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.000
 sorry, I've just read some amazing, I don't know that Jesus Christ was a mushroom.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:13.760
 Anyway, did we have another secret squid? We did. Someone wrote in from a secret U.S. facility.

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:17.920
 And I can't remember why, but that was... It was the people who were training dolphins to

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:23.040
 have to weapons also. We had some of that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, here's one,

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:31.760
 from an anonymous correspondent who says, "I fly the Hawk T2 jet aircraft in the Royal

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:39.520
 Air Force." Can't be many of them. Can't be many. But this is about explosive furniture,

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:45.520
 as our correspondent puts it, which is the ejection seat. And we have mentioned it once. We've

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:51.200
 done an intersection about ejection seats. Many years ago, I think. Yeah. But this is crazy.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:56.880
 During ejection, the pilot will experience around 15 to 25G of acceleration as they're

00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:02.960
 launched clear of the aircraft. This can often lead to ejectees being made permanently shorter in height.

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:10.800
 You're like in a cartoon where they're like a concertina or something. Is that permanently?

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:17.600
 Permanently. Your spine has just gone boom. And then they should make like reverse ejector seats

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:23.440
 that fire you back into the plane and stretch you back. Yes, yes. I just think that's stunning.

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:28.480
 How much shorter? It doesn't say. It's not going to be on foot. It's going to be on foot shorter.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:34.320
 They have to do a whole new uniform for you when you're on the grass. Fun fact, Sabrina Carpensor

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:43.120
 has been ejected out of airplanes four times. She started out in the NBA. That's wild, isn't it?

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:48.080
 I know. And our correspondent adds, when we're discussing ejection at work, we often try to avoid

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:53.360
 the e-word as it is a command word to initiate ejection when talking to other crew in an aircraft.

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:57.680
 You can't even say it if you're discuss it. You can't discuss it and say the word because it's like

00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:04.000
 bang, oh, you've gone. So instead we use terms like bang out, pull the handle and get a free tie.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:12.560
 Oh yeah, because there's the ejection club. Great stuff. I would love to know how many people

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:16.400
 have been accidentally ejected purely because mid-conversation. Someone said the word ejection.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:23.520
 I thought they were trained better than that. No, that's the problem. They're trained so well.

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:33.040
 All right. While we're up in the air, Johnny Noak writes, just finished listening to the latest

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:41.440
 little fish on the issue of glass bottom transport. So Dan invented glass bottom boats, of course.

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:46.160
 And then we came up with the idea of glass bottom airplanes. Yeah. Well, Johnny writes,

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:51.520
 I have been on a glass bottom helicopter ride over the East River in New York City and I nearly

00:14:51.520 --> 00:15:00.080
 SH Asterisk T might certainly really shot yourself. You can really see the waves while flying over the

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:04.160
 river. I really don't think you all down would like to see the sea or runway under an aircraft.

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:08.080
 You're correct. What about me? Correctly dies that you're made of tough stuff, I think.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:14.320
 Oh, that is true. You've been up in helicopters a lot. I love it. Yeah. So I think you're tough enough.

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:17.920
 Yeah. And also with my wife flying them, which does take some bolts.

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:26.960
 It's wild. She's always stopping for directions. No, I mean, like she's an extremely good pilot,

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:30.400
 but I think when it's someone you know, it's a little bit more. I don't know.

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:36.720
 Seeing anyone you know doing something really technically accomplished is impressive and a bit scary

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:42.720
 because you're like, oh, what if my what if I accidentally, yeah, press a button by mistake or

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:48.000
 distract them more, you know. Yeah. Also, I don't know about your date nights, but there's always a very

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.560
 like annoying argument that just comes up and I wouldn't want to be over the English channel

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:58.480
 in a helicopter when you're talking about. Well, I can say that when we fly with my wife in the

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:05.440
 helicopter, sometimes she'll just say, sorry, I haven't been listening to you. I turned your microphone

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:12.400
 off because I had to concentrate because the sound of the helicopter so loud, you can only

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.840
 talk through the microphones. Yeah. And so if she doesn't want to hear what I'm saying,

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:19.920
 she just turns by my cough. Wow. That's why she wanted to become a pilot.

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:30.400
 If only you all could become pilots. That's really funny. That's one of the big annoying things when

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:36.160
 they portray helicopters in films, isn't it? You just see people having a chat and it's no chatting.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:44.400
 Yeah. All right. Anonymous pervert of the week. New section. Yeah. Megan writes.

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:51.600
 Well, they've not got the idea of anonymity. No, I've been cheeky. I've checked with Megan and

00:16:51.600 --> 00:17:02.400
 she said, don't read my surname. Okay. Okay. So this email contains a few layers of TMI,

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:07.520
 so apologies in advance. In a recent episode, James mentioned he once kept close of garlic in his

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:12.240
 socks to see if you'll be able to taste it. Yep. As you did. Yeah. That was one of my, just about

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:21.600
 I'd first joined. I was like, who's this maverick with garlic in his socks? But it was. It's probably

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:26.240
 the G series, actually. You're doing that. Maybe I can't remember when I did it. Well, just after I

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:32.080
 moved to London. Yeah. Or Megan writes. That didn't work, but I do know of an alternate route that does

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:38.240
 brackets one last warning for TMI. Oh dear. Okay. There's only so many places you can put this garlic.

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:44.720
 Many years ago, I had to take some antibiotics and as often happens for women, I could feel a bit of

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:49.600
 a secondary yeast infection coming on due to the microbiome upset. I remembered a moment from an

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:54.240
 edible plants course in college when the instructor went off script and casually mentioned that a

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:59.360
 clove of garlic inserted into the vagina overnight could cure a yeast infection.

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:06.480
 Curious? I'm pretty sure it wouldn't harm. I also scares up. Hormy vampires. Absolutely.

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:15.280
 I got a peel clove and popped it in. Yep. Within about 20 minutes, I could taste and smell garlic.

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:23.440
 Oh wow. Yeah. It was so strong, my husband could smell it on my breath. No. The mucus membranes

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:28.240
 were very efficient at absorbing the garlic into my bloodstream. I ended up not having to take any

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:32.480
 additional meds for yeast overgrowth and the experiment was easy to dislodge and all round winning

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:39.520
 my book. Well, I would just say on behalf of Jen Gunter who is often seen in the newspapers and

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:46.160
 says do not put anything in your vagina that doesn't belong there. I think I'm channeling her now

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:51.520
 and she's going to say do not put garlic in your vagina. I think that's a really good, I just don't

00:18:51.520 --> 00:19:00.240
 think we can advise people to do it. No. But on her breath, is that, yeah, that feels... Yeah,

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:04.880
 because it gets into your system, right? How many is that because it's a very specific type of food

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:17.120
 or could you put? I'm thinking game show. What does your wife... I've got down there. You've got one

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:31.200
 sniff of her mouth. It's Ginstus. Which Ginstus? That's really good. Oh, yeah. It's a game show. It's a

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:35.760
 game show. But you need to find a way for the husbands to play it as well. We have if they're winning

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:42.240
 lots of money. No, you need to put... Sorry, you need to have a Ginstus past your bum. Does it worry

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:47.920
 that way? I don't know. I don't know if in the Aedis produces the same thing. No, I don't know, I don't

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:52.720
 know. You would expect so. Ah, but if I could get 2000 quid, I'm just going hobnobbs, I'm in.

00:19:52.720 --> 00:20:03.440
 2000. Such a low bar, career ruinedingly embarrassing moment on TV. We found Dad's price.

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:14.640
 And there's no travel expenses there either. That comes out of his own pocket. That's between me and

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:22.720
 for no one. Oh, yeah. Got to pay for the garlic as well. Oh, dear. For one month's relief on the mortgage.

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:34.240
 Well, good Lord. Okay, so thank you, Megan. It's top tip, but when we can't, we legally, like

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:39.840
 ethically shouldn't pass on. Absolutely. So put it from your minds. Justin Murant says, just finished

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:43.040
 listening to episode six and nine. Thought you might find it interesting to know there are, in fact,

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:49.440
 two Laurel and Hardy museums in the world. Thank you. In fairness, Andy did say there should be a

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:55.360
 maximum of two. Yes, it's true. Yeah. And the other one is where Hardy was born in the States.

00:20:55.360 --> 00:21:00.880
 Justin says, I still haven't been, but I see the sign for it every time I drive to Augusta. Dave

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:04.800
 Ryanettes, it was great to hear my hometown of Olveston get a mention on the pod and it's indeed

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:11.120
 the birthplace of Stan Laurel. And the town has wholeheartedly embraced all things Laurel and Hardy.

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:15.360
 And Dave has sent a selection of photos of Laurel and Hardy based stuff in the town.

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:22.560
 Good statues. There is a statue. The house sold it from your house. Yeah. How tall we had a

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:28.000
 sort of hype restriction that are as they had to be sort of like that. Oh, statue hats really.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.040
 Statue hats. Yeah. Yeah. Because for flat dwellers, you know, people who don't have a big garden,

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:40.080
 but a statue of Stan Laurel. That was a stunning moment. For anyone who's not heard it, listen to the

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:45.280
 Amy Glitter episode. We're down reveals that in 2003. Yeah. I was in Kosovo and a friend of my

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:50.480
 grandmother's was opening up a couple of cafes. And while we're all chatting, we landed on the idea

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:56.320
 of Laurel and Hardy. So Laurel would be the ice cream bar and down the road was Hardy. So it was two

00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:01.440
 locations. I mentioned this to my wife and she just said, that wasn't that long after the war.

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:10.240
 What can we do to bring this fractured place back together? It was an amazing place to be.

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:17.120
 Post-war. It's hard to explain if you've never been in a post-war country. The jubilation of people

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:21.360
 that thing is over. It was quite. Yeah. It was pretty remarkable. Yeah. So so much so they were

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:28.000
 willing to go along with any insane idea for a cafe. But can you guess what the florist shop in

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.080
 Alvester is called? Laurel and Hardy? Got it in one. Okay.

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:40.240
 Dave. Laurel, I mean, Laurel is a type of plant and Hardy perennials is also a type of plant.

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:46.800
 Absolutely. I was going to go for Laurel and Hardy. That's really good.

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:55.440
 Names, names, names. Graeme McPherson just points out that ref surnames that are UK towns and cities

00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:03.760
 glaring a mission of Crocodile Dundee. Okay. For another big person. Yep. And Rodrigo Pimentel,

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:10.240
 writes, I believe this is all the way from Brazil. You mentioned someone named Hamburger and said,

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:15.840
 none of you knew anyone else by that name. Well, a friend of my family is not only called Hamburger.

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:27.200
 His first name is Cal. Cal Hamburger. It's spelled C-A-O, but it's Brazilian. It's pronounced

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:33.680
 Cal. Hey, here's a name fact. There's an interesting one that I only learned today. Curacao.

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:39.360
 Oh, yeah. Curacao is an island in the Caribbean and they've just qualified for the World Cup.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:47.920
 And their manager is called Dick Advocat. And Curacao, an advocate of both types of Dutch liquor.

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:52.800
 Oh, amazing. Isn't that cool? That is cool. That's so good. I'm sure I've got a bottle of blue,

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:57.360
 but it's blue Curacao. Yeah, yeah. Got a bottle of that. Knocking around at home. Lovely stuff.

00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:00.800
 Very nice. As you consistently with one inch messing from the top because you buy it,

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:06.000
 you make one drink, you make Americans stay there for the next 10 years. I got a name one as well

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.760
 that they came across. Drew Barrymore, her name is basically a double barrel surname.

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:17.520
 She's from two prominent families. One is called the Barrymore. The other had the surname Drew,

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:24.080
 and they given her that name, but she did not have a first name. No, but they became Barrymore's

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:29.280
 a few down, but they are two family trees that are quite famous within Hollywood. The Barrymore,

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:33.200
 yeah, they're really famous Hollywood family aren't there? There's loads of Barrymore. John Barrymore.

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:37.600
 Yeah, exactly. Are you ready for a picture? Yeah. Melissa Hogan writes,

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:41.280
 "I listened to you in my recent episode with Rachel Paris and you guys spoke about the

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:46.640
 levelable Beethoven dog." Oh, yeah, yeah. For reasons I can't remember, I recently came across the

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:52.720
 attached listing on Facebook Marketplace. I'm going to slide this over to you guys. Just tell me what

00:24:52.720 --> 00:25:05.680
 you're seeing. Wow, this is the original animatronic Beethoven dog puppets. Yes, not all of it.

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:14.160
 Unfortunately, does not include the head. Good god. It's a decapitated robot dog. It's quite something.

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:21.440
 Imagine if you came down one morning and you're a pet dog, look like that. Wow. Isn't that amazing?

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:26.240
 That is cool. I wonder what scenes have the animatronic Beethoven been used?

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:30.000
 Hey, Dan, after you've done that game show, you can buy two of those.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.360
 If I win.

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:44.240
 Is the idea. Because you've got to be kept separate from your spouse for a good long while before

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:49.120
 the show, so you can't communicate with each other. No, no, no, no, it's fine because the,

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:54.000
 yeah, I guess the production is, actually, we have stayed as 20 minutes, 20 minutes, 20 minutes.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:01.360
 So the production is providing the food and a room for it to go. Oh, sorry, we are going to bill

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:07.440
 you for the food. Oh, God, it has to be something cheap then. I don't want half the budget.

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:16.480
 Now I'm going to win going on some expensive food. It's very raucous this one. That's amazing,

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:23.760
 the Beethoven dog. Now we come to sausage corner. We talked about chocolate sausages.

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:31.280
 Yeah, your favorite. It's your, your craft. It's my pister resistance. Yeah, it's my Christmas

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:39.360
 treat for the whole family. A chocolate salami. David Neiman writes, "Your most recent podcast

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:45.440
 title, no such thing as a chocolate sausage, caught my eye." As per the subject, there is such a thing

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:50.880
 as a chocolate sausage. I'm a sausage purveyor in Canada and we have an honest,

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:55.680
 a good, non-desert chocolate sausage. So I think this is technically advertising being

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:59.840
 sneaked into lots of life. But we have been offered, excitingly, some chocolate sausage if we do

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:09.520
 go to Toronto. Oh, okay. So there you go. Toronto. Yeah, me too. Me too. Toronto. Toronto.

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:17.360
 That's how they pronounce it, isn't it? I'll dial right here. Oh, no. Molly McEnany ads.

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:21.120
 There is a Silicon Valley industry which has been dominated by one family for generations. The

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:28.720
 New York style sausage industry apparently is a huge Silicon Valley business which makes New York

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:35.840
 style sausage, but in California. Okay. Yeah. Maybe the style sausage. Do we know what that is?

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:43.040
 I don't, but I've never eaten a sausage in New York. I don't think I'm sure I have.

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:49.200
 Like hot dogs, I guess? I've had hot dogs at spotting events there. I can feel you all wanting

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:55.840
 to write in. Don't worry, I'll Google it after. Making it sound like we don't want any emails.

00:27:55.840 --> 00:28:01.200
 And we do. I love the emails. I love the emails. But you know, when you just feel

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:06.960
 aware, like, oh, a floodgate is opening here. Yeah. And I like genuinely. I crave it. It's so much

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:11.920
 from being in the inbox. But if you tell you what, if you've ever made a New York style sausage,

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:22.880
 drop us a line. Yeah. There we go. Yeah. Rick Lapuadeva. What a great name. Rick Lapuadeva.

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:28.800
 He sounds like he's Canadian. Could be. One for Andy here. I've made chocolate salami too,

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:40.160
 but disguised mind for a pleasant Christmas day treat. I'm going to hand this over to you. And I

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:49.600
 just like you to see how well Rick has disguised his chocolate salami. As a poo. Oh, is it? You know

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:54.400
 what? I can't really quite tell what that is. Yeah. I know. The printer is like a chocolate log.

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:57.280
 The printer is not very good at rendering cakes. I can assure you.

00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:05.040
 So what is the idea of his meal? The design. It is. It's a poo. What's the white mushroom?

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:08.880
 There's a mushroom. That's a mushroom. Sorry. I think with leaves. And yeah, we've got it now. Sorry,

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:13.760
 it is it is slightly a bad printing. It's like this is a forest floor. Basically, forest floor. Yeah.

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:17.760
 Well, the viewer will be seeing it on the screen right now. Yeah. And it's an extraordinary

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:21.360
 thing to be presented with. Love it. It's very beautiful. It is stunning. But

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:29.440
 it's absolutely horrific. I'm sorry. I'm going to say I got to say when you get to like a series

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:34.720
 eight, nine or ten of your pudding food in your passages, once you're getting to

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:41.120
 chocolate poo's up there, then it becomes very meta. Yeah. The show is.

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:45.680
 It's the ultimate double bluff.

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:54.880
 That's if they did it on Taskmaster. That's what it would be, wouldn't it?

00:29:54.880 --> 00:30:00.560
 Alex Hahn just doing a little trick. I was worried that I wasn't going to cry with laughter.

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:04.160
 Trigger sounds. It feels wrong to end without it happening at some point, though.

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:09.920
 There's an email from Kim Klauson, who brilliantly calls herself Pacific Kim.

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:11.840
 Because she knows I like Pacific Brits. Yeah, very good.

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:19.920
 Who mentions there has been a show made by the creators of Game of Thrones about the assassination

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:25.680
 of President Garfield. Oh, I saw this. Yeah, yeah. I don't think it's out in the UK. Yeah.

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:29.840
 Maybe not. I don't know. This show is called Death by Lightning.

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:35.840
 Interesting. My old nickname. It's about a time traveler from a podcast in the UK.

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:40.800
 He goes back. He's at a Mongolian death worm who doesn't say. But Kim points out it's about the

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:46.800
 ass assassination of President Garfield. Yep. Because he ended up eating. Yeah. And Chris Busch says,

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:51.600
 "He's watched the show." Chris Busch has watched the show and writes in saying there was no mention

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:56.240
 whatsoever, not even a passing whisper of how our poor Garfield spent his final days eating through

00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:01.920
 his anus, not a frame, not a line, not even a respectful nod. Do we know if anyone

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:06.960
 smelt his breath after he had a meal? Dr. Dr. Willough bless. Dr. Willough bless.

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:13.600
 Dr. Willough goes up to his mouth and goes, "Gig squirrel soup, definitely squirrel soup, maybe some eggs."

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:19.840
 Well, the bad news is you're going to die. The good news is Dr. Dr. Willough bless is one two thousand dollars.

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:30.160
 Yeah, I did see that movie, that series and I'm really excited to watch it. Yeah. But just don't expect

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:37.760
 anything about the truth as we know it. The main event. And on our final presidential

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:41.520
 assassination bit, James Kerry adds, "We mentioned the bed where President Lincoln died."

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:47.520
 Yes. Would you saw? I visited it. Yeah. Well, did you know that the room where John Wilkes Booth

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:52.160
 planned the assassination of Lincoln is now a Chinese karaoke joint called "Walk and Roll."

00:31:53.760 --> 00:32:04.160
 So good. Yeah. Do you get a Booth to do the karaoke? Very good. Take the rest of the week off.

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:08.160
 Okay. See you later. Thanks so much. Right into podcast@ky.com.

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:12.400
 That's a great premise for a podcast that you can only leave if you've made an absolute zigger.

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:19.520
 And it's just going to let your stuck the last one in the room. Hello. Welcome to episode 716

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:27.440
 of "Take the rest of the week off." I'm, as every week, James Harkin. I'm not joined by anyone

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:33.120
 Dunstriver left an episode four and Andrew Huntsomer left an episode seven hundred and four.

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:38.640
 But once again, I'll be trying to come up with any old shit.

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:45.200
 Oh, dear. Anyway, there you go. That's just a great fact. Lovely. It's nearly home time.

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:53.360
 You've all done really well. Carla Dempsey points out that there's a marketing professor at the University

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:58.160
 of Toronto School of Management who studied non-alcoholic drinks and he's called David Soberman.

00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:05.200
 And it brilliant. And Ian BB Edds, the master blender for Johnny Walker, I feel like we didn't

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:09.600
 give enough to that Soberman thing. That's very kind of. You kind of ran through it. Yeah. I said

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:17.760
 very good. Yeah, I nodded. Honestly, like the levels of response you get on this show from us

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:25.120
 is laugh, very good, silent nod. That's the top. What a horrible elitist thing that I did that you

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:29.680
 have to upgrade to a higher tier on the Patreon to see my response to that joke. Oh yeah.

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:35.200
 People listening to the show when I've heard my nod. Unfortunately not. We've got a little bell on

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:51.520
 your forehead. I'm up for it. Yeah. Let's do it. One of the non-determine Ian BB Edds, the master blender

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:57.600
 for Johnny Walker Whiskey is a woman called Emma Walker. That's quite good. But her predecessor was Jim

00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:04.640
 Beveridge. Lovely. Brilliant. Really good. Yeah. That's just a little bit of time in the nominative

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:08.800
 determinism dungeon where we end most of our shows. Very good. Yeah.

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:19.840
 And that's about it for this episode of Drop of the Line. Ah, so soon. I just so soon. It's flown by.

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:25.760
 It was bulging there. You're right. It was. Very good. Thank you so much everyone for listening to.

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:30.000
 I'm watching this episode of Drop of the Line and thank you for all your emails. We are podcast

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.120
 at qi.com. If anything we have said has sparked anything, whether you have extra information, whether

00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:40.560
 it's an Oklahoma based complaint, we accept them all and we read them all. A little notification.

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:45.120
 After we've started doing little fish, the number of emails flooding into the inbox has genuinely

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:50.880
 become a flood. So we may no longer be able to reply to every single one and I am very sorry about

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:55.920
 that. But I will still be reading them all and putting them together. You're reply to as many as you can.

00:34:55.920 --> 00:35:02.000
 I'll reply to as many as I can but just just let you down gently in advance. I'm really sorry but it's

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:08.000
 it's become I would say torrent into the thin box. But keep it coming because it's really fun and I

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.720
 love reading. So podcast at qi.com. Thanks very much again for listening to this show and we'll see

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:17.120
 you next time. Bye. Bye.
