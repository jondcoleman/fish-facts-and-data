 [Theme song plays]

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.840
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.480
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from the Nerdland Festival in Belgium!

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:32.280
 [Cheering]

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:40.200
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.880
 and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.920
 and in no particular order, here we go!

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.160
 Starting with fact number one, and that is my fact,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.880
 my fact this week is that there are more scientific papers on dung beetles

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.480
 than there are on preventing the extinction of mankind.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.640
 Wow!

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.800
 Yeah, so...

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.120
 I've got a little spider just walking on the side of the table here, look at that, oh he's on my finger!

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.880
 Very nice.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.200
 All I'm saying is it's not weird to be interested in insects.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.880
 Yes.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.120
 That spider's come for this fact, absolutely loving it.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.880
 No, this is a brilliant new book coming out, it's coming out in July,

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.720
 it's called The Anti-Catastrophe League by Tom Off,

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.480
 and it's basically a look into all the people globally who are trying to stop us from going extinct.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.520
 How do we survive a super volcano?

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.640
 How do we survive asteroid attacks?

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.800
 How do we survive AI if it gets too intelligent?

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.200
 He goes around the world and he meets all the people who are dedicating their lives to doing it,

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.120
 and as one of the little nuggets in there,

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.280
 he brings up a little fact by a guy called Nick Bostrom,

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.600
 who's quite a famous scientist and is a big player in this kind of existential risk thing,

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.320
 where he says, yeah, basically if you look into the literature,

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.400
 there's more on dung beetles in scientific literature than there is on surviving.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.840
 Is there anything on how dung beetles might cause us to go extinct?

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.480
 Oh, good question.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.040
 Or help us avoid it!

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.520
 That's not immediately make them the villains of the piece.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.200
 If the dung beetles went on strike, then...

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.640
 - Yeah, we'd be up to our necks and... - Exactly.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.120
 - We'd be in the shit, literally. - Yeah.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.440
 - So we need to kill all dung beetles? - No.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.080
 - Okay, that's what it sounded like. - So how is the world going to end according to your mate?

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.880
 I mean, there are so many different ways.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.280
 I should just say, just for context, in 2018, there was a Google scholar search

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.560
 which showed 1,830 results for dung beetle-based papers,

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:49.360
 as opposed to 449 for human extinction and 940 for terms like existential risk and so on.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.440
 It's more a metaphor for the fact that we're focusing more on things like insects

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.040
 than we are on these bigger problems.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.000
 Well, that's because dung beetles exist, so they're easy to study.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.280
 - The end of the world doesn't exist. - Yes, that's largely...

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.720
 And as far as we're concerned, it never will.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.080
 Well, the end of humanity, sorry, not the end of the world.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.920
 It really pisses me off when humans do this.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.280
 The world doesn't give a shit if we go extinct.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.160
 The world's just going to keep on turning.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.480
 And I think quite a lot of the people who look into it are talking about things

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.480
 that are so unlikely, aren't they, that you think like there was that...

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.400
 - What kind of stuff, yeah. - So, there was an open letter

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.880
 written by a bunch of scientists recently, I think 38 of the world's leading scientists,

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.600
 Nobel Prize winners and the like, wrote an open letter with a warning,

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.760
 "Stop trying to create the mirror image of life on Earth,

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.560
 because it will wipe us all out."

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.880
 So, very dumb-down version, all proteins made of amino acids

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.120
 which are left-handed, which is just all about the way they spin,

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.960
 we don't really know why all life is built out of these left-handed amino acids.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.400
 But scientists can now synthesise in labs right-handed amino acids,

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.040
 and that could be super useful for lots of things that can make better drugs,

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.640
 so it could really, like, it could defeat a lot of sort of natural biological things,

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.320
 but it could also wipe us all out,

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.080
 because basically, if you get a right-handed bacteria that we've created in a lab,

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.920
 nothing has evolved to beat it.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.920
 A right-handed bacteria attacks our bodies and our bodies don't even recognise it.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.000
 - They don't even see it. It's invisible. - It's like a left-handed cricketer.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.440
 - Or a tennis player. - It's Nadal.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.600
 - Are they invisible? - They're unbeatable, yeah.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.320
 Unbeatable. There you go. You can't play them.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.720
 Another thing that's similar to that is a thing called strange matter,

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.200
 and this is if you get nuclear stuff and you squash it down, squash it down, squash it down,

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.800
 it can turn into this thing called strange matter,

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.240
 and if it comes and touches normal matter, then they can annihilate each other,

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.080
 and that thing that might happen is known as a strange conversation.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.840
 And apparently, if you get a strange conversation happening anywhere in the universe,

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.160
 that could be the end of everything.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.320
 It feels like we should be annihilating each other all the time, what are you saying?

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.320
 That's so funny.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.800
 So there are big groups that are trying to work out how to save us all,

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.320
 and in 2005, this guy mentioned Nick Bostrom, who's a big best-selling author,

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.760
 he's a big name in science, he founded the Future of Humanity Institute,

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.720
 and when they look at these bigger problems, how are we going to survive as a species?

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.000
 So it was him, there's another guy who joined, called Anders Sandberg,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.720
 very interesting character, Swedish scientist,

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.680
 he developed a bunch of ideas that he's been putting forward in the science world,

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.520
 but my favorite thing is he wrote a paper that asked the question,

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.920
 "What if the entire Earth was instantaneously replaced

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:32.080
 with an equal volume of closely packed but uncompressed blueberries?"

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.560
 Okay.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.400
 He picked big, thick-skinned, high-bush blueberries,

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.840
 because he thought that was best for it.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.080
 And so what's going to happen?

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.720
 It's a very hostile world, James.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:41.720
 Wait, it's not good.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.000
 Oh, I was going to guess nothing at all happens,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.080
 because that's the answer half the time, because it would...

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.920
 Small blueberry farmers go out of business quite quickly.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.480
 That's true, that's true.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.680
 No, he said if you were standing on blueberries,

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.440
 it might be possible, in theory, that we could survive.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.840
 However, almost immediately, they would begin to compress rapidly,

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.040
 and then air would start erupting everywhere,

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.720
 causing great earthquakes,

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.600
 and then the entire environment would be completely filled

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.240
 by boiling jam and steam,

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.280
 and we would live in just a big, crazy jam world.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.360
 But is this... Sorry, has he got funding to find out that this is a bad idea?

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.440
 Yeah, and you're saying there should be more papers like this?

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.480
 I'm saying this is the co-founder of an institution

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.920
 that's looking to work out how we survive into infinity.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.880
 Okay, so he was the co-founder with Nick Bostrom.

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:28.680
 Yeah, Bostrom, yeah.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.240
 So one of Nick Bostrom's idea is the paperclip maximiser.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.520
 And that is that you come up with an AI, and you say to that AI,

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.680
 "What we need is paperclips."

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.480
 But you don't give it any other instructions, you say to it,

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.280
 "Whatever you do, make as many paperclips as you can."

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.560
 And if you do that, they'll quickly realise

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.480
 that if they make too many paperclips,

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.640
 then the humans might come and turn the machine off,

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.240
 so they immediately decide to kill all the humans,

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.840
 because they don't want to get turned off.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.360
 And then they also realise that humans are made out of carbon

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.120
 and lots of different metals and stuff.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.120
 And actually, we're quite good paperclip material.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.440
 And so what you end up is the world with no humans,

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.080
 but a ton of paperclips.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.640
 Pick up your paperclips with this little eye looking back like that.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:15.600
 It looks like you're trying to end the world.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:16.680
 Very nice.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:17.520
 It's beautiful.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:18.920
 And the idea is that it would then go,

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.440
 "Well, we should make everything in the universe paperclips."

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.040
 And it would take over planets and set up paperclip factories

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:27.800
 and make more until all of existence was one big paperclip.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.320
 Actually, I wrote to Nick Bostrom, the scientist, a few years ago,

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.920
 because I was researching something about the end of the world

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.800
 and I wanted his opinion of it.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.240
 And he just sent me a rather nice line.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.920
 I think you might like this.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.280
 He said, "Some of our biggest problems

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.440
 are primarily political and ethical,

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.320
 and they'll need solutions in those realms.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:50.280
 For a great future, we really need both capability and love.

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:54.240
 But if we could only have one, I'd pick love,

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.760
 and I would pick capability, personally."

00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.800
 I think he's going to be disappointed from that,

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.760
 because I think he was flirting with you.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.120
 Oh, no!

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.600
 That was effectively a swipe last day, Andy.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.440
 You know, the good news about the end of the world,

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.480
 if you think about it, is...

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.960
 So, what's one of the ideas for defeating it?

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.040
 Well, there's a guy you might not have heard of called Elon Musk,

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.760
 who talks a lot about terraforming Mars

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.640
 as being a way that humans could escape and go to another place.

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.200
 What's the main problem with Mars,

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.360
 the thing we need to do to it, to make it liveable?

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.800
 Like, everything.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.040
 We need to stop all the radiation.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:30.760
 Loads of stuff, yeah.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:31.760
 Get rid of the aliens.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:32.760
 OK.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.240
 (LAUGHTER)

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.000
 Loads of stuff, not including that.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.080
 But one of the big things is make it warmer,

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:41.520
 and we already know how to warm a planet.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.480
 Oh! Oh, terrific!

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.560
 So, and as Elon Musk has planned,

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:51.280
 he has a plan to drop hydrogen bombs into the atmosphere above Mars

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.440
 every few seconds, and that will release the carbon dioxide

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.080
 trapped in Mars' ice caps.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.440
 Would we know that carbon dioxide warmed a planet

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.680
 unless we'd already experimented with this one?

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:01.680
 No.

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.320
 So, was it all part of the game?

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.560
 I think it might be worth sending him up there,

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.760
 maybe with his ex-best mate.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.640
 (LAUGHTER)

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.880
 Wow.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:12.880
 Have done beetles?

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:13.880
 Oh, yeah. Yeah.

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.880
 They don't just eat dung.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:16.880
 OK, get out.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:17.880
 Yeah.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:18.880
 Some of them eat fungi.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.880
 Some of them eat rotting fruits.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:21.880
 Some of them eat carrion.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.880
 I mean, none of them eat burgers.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.880
 It's all pretty disgusting stuff.

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.880
 Decapitated millipedes.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:28.880
 I read about that one.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:29.880
 It's a dung beetle in Peru.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.880
 It has given up eating poo,

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:35.880
 and they all have this kind of chisel shape on their head

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.880
 to shape the poo into a ball,

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:38.880
 which is what they normally do.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.880
 But this one in Peru, it has given up eating poo,

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.880
 and it uses its chisel to decapitate millipedes.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.880
 So, at what point?

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.880
 That's an evolutionary question.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:49.880
 It's just one dung beetle.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.880
 He goes, "Wait a minute."

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.880
 This is delicious, compared with what I've been eating my whole life.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:58.880
 Also, they don't eat very large pieces of poo.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:09:59.880
 (LAUGHTER)

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:00.880
 They're very fussy eaters,

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:04.880
 and they have a bad reputation as being like the slobs.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.880
 Dung beetles specifically pick out

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:10.880
 nitrogen-rich, tiny particles inside poo.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.880
 So, actually, they hate the big bits of poo.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:16.880
 But they're picking particles two thousandths of a millimetre big.

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.880
 That's not a sizeable meal.

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.880
 So, is there actually any poo in that?

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:21.880
 It's all poo.

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:22.880
 It's all poo.

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:25.880
 No, because sometimes when I poo, there's corn in it.

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:26.880
 Oh, my God.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.880
 You're going to get extra materials.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.880
 It's all poo once it's part of the poo.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:35.880
 I think I'm not going to dance, Rastron.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:39.880
 You know, a single elephant can maintain two million dung beetles.

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:40.880
 Oh, nice.

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:41.880
 That is good.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.880
 But then if that one elephant dies, then they're all out of business.

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:45.880
 Are they alive?

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:46.880
 That's true.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:47.880
 Yes.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.880
 It's like a Trojan elephant kind of situation.

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:50.880
 No, they're not inside it.

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:51.880
 Oh, sorry.

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:52.880
 (LAUGHTER)

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:53.880
 What did you say?

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:54.880
 What did you say?

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.880
 (LAUGHTER)

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.880
 I said, "Sustain, not contain."

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.880
 (LAUGHTER)

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:07.880
 The onphophagous taurus, the bull-headed dung beetle,

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:10.880
 it's kind of the poster boy for dung beetles.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.880
 They can pull dung 1,000 times their body weight.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:14.880
 Wow.

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.880
 Which is the equivalent of me being able to pull

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:20.880
 an entire right whale's testicle made of poo.

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:21.880
 Ah!

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.880
 How relatable for everyone.

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:24.880
 (LAUGHTER)

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:25.880
 Thank you.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:29.880
 (MUSIC)

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:33.880
 It is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:39.880
 My fact is, new Finnish doctors are officially issued with a sword.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:43.880
 Short doctors get a short sword, and tall doctors get a long sword.

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:44.880
 Oh.

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.880
 And it's if you get a doctorate of medicine or philosophy or whatever,

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.880
 you get to wear a nice top hat, which we don't have in the UK.

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:51.880
 You see, because when you said this,

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:53.880
 I thought you meant doctors as medical doctors.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:57.880
 It is medical doctors, but it's also, it's getting a doctorate.

00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.880
 It's graduating, basically.

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:00.880
 Graduating, yes.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.880
 So fine arts, probably business, PhDs, whatever it is.

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:06.880
 And if you're under a certain height, you get a 76-centimeter sword.

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.880
 If you're a bit taller, you get an 81-centimeter sword.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.880
 It's not a huge difference.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:14.880
 The night before you graduate, you go to a traditional sword wetting ceremony,

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.880
 where you have to go and sharpen your own sword.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:18.880
 That's wet.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:19.880
 Wetting.

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:20.880
 Wetting.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.880
 I think you need to wet it a little bit as part of the hotting.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.880
 So that wetting in this case means sort of grinding it down.

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.880
 Sharpening it on a grindstone.

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:27.880
 That's cool.

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:28.880
 And it's a whole process, right?

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.880
 Like, you apply for it, you give your name,

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.880
 which gets etched into the side of it.

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.880
 It has the date of your graduation, I believe, there as well.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.880
 And the hat is the only difference.

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.880
 That's how you tell what they're graduating from.

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:40.880
 So they wear a hat?

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.880
 They all wear top hats.

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.880
 They are also bespoke hats made on the front of them.

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:50.880
 There's a little gold emblem that shows the faculties and so on that they're connected to.

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.880
 And so if you're a doctor of fine arts, you'll get a dark blue hat.

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.880
 But if you're a doctor of law, you get crimson.

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:58.880
 So that's how you tell the different doctorates apart.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:02.880
 Apparently that idea comes back from the University of Uppsala,

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:04.880
 which is in Sweden, not Finland.

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:09.880
 And some students went to Finland from Uppsala and they were wearing purple berets.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.880
 But they were like, "Oh, they look really great. Let's do that."

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:14.880
 And Uppsala got their idea from the Romans.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:19.880
 And the idea was if you were a freed slave, you would get a red hat.

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.880
 It all goes back all the way to that.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:25.880
 And speaking of Uppsala, by the way, at 10 p.m. every night,

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:29.880
 the students in Uppsala open their windows and start screaming.

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:30.880
 And nobody knows why.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:31.880
 Every night?

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:32.880
 Every night.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.880
 But someone needs to ask them.

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:37.880
 Well, they do it because their predecessors have done it

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:38.880
 and their predecessors have done it.

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:42.880
 But the reason that the original ones did it is lost to the midst of time.

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:43.880
 Right.

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.880
 Do you know how long they've been doing it?

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.880
 Since the '70s.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:48.880
 Oh, okay.

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:49.880
 Since the '70s.

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:53.880
 Since, okay, someone must be alive there from the '70s.

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:55.880
 But I think a lot was happening in the '70s

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:57.880
 that people don't really know why they were doing it.

00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:58.880
 Yeah, right.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:13:59.880
 They're all jogged up to their eyeballs.

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:00.880
 Got it.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:01.880
 They didn't know why at the time.

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:03.880
 What did you guys do when you graduated?

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:04.880
 I can't remember.

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:05.880
 Nothing.

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:06.880
 I really can't.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.880
 I've tried to remember the ceremony because I was researching this fact.

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:09.880
 I can't remember the day.

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:10.880
 I can't remember being there.

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:11.880
 Really?

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.880
 I have a memory of watching myself graduate from up high in the thing.

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:14.880
 But that can't be right.

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.880
 Well, so that maybe you nearly died?

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.880
 I didn't have an out-of-body experience.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:19.880
 I did die.

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:20.880
 Okay.

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.880
 No, I just can't recall it at all.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:23.880
 Yeah, I just can't remember either.

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:24.880
 Really?

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:25.880
 Yeah.

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:26.880
 I can't either.

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:27.880
 You didn't graduate.

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.880
 That's true, by the way.

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.880
 I just think it's not as big a thing.

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.880
 I mean, I didn't go to mine as big a thing here.

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:37.880
 It's somewhere like America where it's obviously this huge deal.

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:43.880
 And I like in America the massive fanfare over who's going to do the commencement speech.

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:47.880
 And there's always this struggle between all American universities to get big celebs.

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:52.880
 It seems so random, like Taylor Swift, JK Rowling, Bill Cosby, Robert De Niro.

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.880
 They're all very proud of their choices.

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:56.880
 Taylor Swift.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.880
 I know, I know.

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.880
 A morally questionable choice, I agree.

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:02.880
 Fly me.

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.880
 Adam, didn't you study at Edinburgh?

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:09.880
 I think you missed a massive opportunity when you didn't go to your graduation ceremony.

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:10.880
 Did I?

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:15.880
 Everyone who graduates from Edinburgh gets tapped on the head with a hat that is made

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:19.880
 from the seat of the trousers of John Knox.

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:22.880
 Now, John Knox is not famous in the UK either.

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.880
 But he is important.

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:28.880
 He was the founder of the Presbyterian Church.

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.880
 He was a huge figure in Scottish history and Scotland's story.

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:36.880
 So when he died, a pair of his breeches were turned into the Geneva Bonnet.

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:43.880
 And now hundreds of thousands of students have been gently bonked on the head with a hat that's made of his trousers.

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.880
 And you missed the chance.

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:49.880
 Except about 10 years ago, they decided to do some restoration on the hat.

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:55.880
 And they found a note inside saying Henry Banks, 22 Duke Street, 1849.

00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:58.880
 So he was supposed to have been around in the 16th century.

00:15:58.880 --> 00:15:59.880
 Yeah.

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:02.880
 So it's at least 300 years younger than they claim it to be.

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:03.880
 Right.

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:04.880
 Yes.

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:05.880
 Yes.

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:06.880
 That's true.

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:07.880
 But it has been to space.

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:08.880
 It's been to space.

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:09.880
 Oh, well.

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:10.880
 Well, it hasn't been.

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:12.880
 Let me knock down your fact.

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.880
 It's that they tried to take it to space, didn't they?

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:19.880
 And the university said, no, you can't take these 100 year old trousers,

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:21.880
 which we're pretending are 500 years old into space.

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:25.880
 So they instead took a piece of cloth to space and then sewed it in when they got back.

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:29.880
 Nothing about this is making me regret not attending my graduation.

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:32.880
 The graduation related person, the biggest fan of his, Chuck Schumer.

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:34.880
 Are you familiar with Chuck Schumer's work in graduations?

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:35.880
 No.

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:37.880
 So Chuck Schumer, I mean, why he's a little bit like John Knox.

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:39.880
 You're like, Chuck Schumer, who is that?

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:44.880
 He's a Senate majority leader or was until very recently, a Democrat.

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:47.880
 And he's one of the people who does commencement speeches, one of the celebs.

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:50.880
 But apparently he's just does them all.

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:52.880
 So he's in New York, he's entering New York.

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:55.880
 And if you've been to uni or primary school or secondary school,

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:59.880
 got a doctorate and undergrad and masters, he's rocked up.

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:02.880
 Some people think sometimes uninvited just does the commencement speech.

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:06.880
 And there are Reddit threads of people going, I've been educated in New York.

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:09.880
 I've seen that sudden speech five times.

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.880
 It's always exactly the same.

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:14.880
 And apparently if you're sitting in the audience doing a PhD and you've gone through all education,

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:17.880
 you could literally just mow the long the speech with Chuck Schumer.

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:18.880
 Wow.

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:19.880
 As he says it over and over again.

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:20.880
 Wow.

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:21.880
 It's really cool.

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:24.880
 I have a favorite graduation person from America as well.

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:25.880
 Everyone does.

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:26.880
 Everyone has one.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.880
 Benjamin B. Bulger.

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:31.880
 Benjamin B. Bulger, he's in his fifties now.

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:34.880
 He has graduated 17 times.

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:37.880
 Or at least he will have got his 17th very soon.

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:40.880
 And these are not from sort of like online places.

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:45.880
 He graduated from Harvard, from Brown, from Stanford, Cambridge, Oxford.

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:48.880
 I don't know if he's officially attended all 17 graduations.

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:49.880
 He's actually getting degrees.

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:50.880
 Yeah.

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.880
 What makes me think is getting a degree is not a good pathway to getting a job.

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:54.880
 Yeah.

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:55.880
 If he still hasn't managed to find one.

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.880
 But he seems at a basic character.

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.880
 He got expelled from preschool.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:03.880
 He went to a school called Noah's Ark.

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:09.880
 And he got expelled because he kept asking too many difficult questions about the animals on the Ark.

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.880
 So he said, well, what are the lions?

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:13.880
 Wouldn't they get hungry?

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:14.880
 What's going to happen then?

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:15.880
 They're going to eat everything.

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:17.880
 And they just went, listen, you're out of here in preschool.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:18.880
 Wow.

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:19.880
 Yeah.

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:20.880
 So he loves studying.

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:22.880
 He homeschools his kids.

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.880
 So he's called Benjamin B. Bulger.

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:27.880
 He has a son called Benjamin B. Bulger, junior.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:29.880
 And a daughter called Benjamina.

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.880
 Oh, lovely name.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:32.880
 Yeah.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.880
 We got an audience fact sent in about this recently, actually.

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:36.880
 I really like this.

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:37.880
 This is from someone.

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:39.880
 This is from Neil from Shrewsbury.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:40.880
 So thank you, Neil.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:41.880
 Right.

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:42.880
 I love this.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:55.880
 For 500 years, if you wanted to get a Master of Arts degree from Oxford University, you had to swear an oath that you would never be reconciled with Henry Simeonis.

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:59.880
 Nobody knows or knew at the time who Henry Simeonis was.

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:03.880
 But you had to swear, swear on your life, you would never make up with him, never settle the argument.

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:08.880
 The oath was abolished in 1827 because nobody knew what they were abolishing.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:09.880
 And do we know now?

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:10.880
 We do know now.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.880
 He killed someone.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:13.880
 He killed someone.

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:18.880
 But in like 12 something, I mean, he killed someone 600 years before.

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:19.880
 It's been a long time.

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:20.880
 It's been a long time.

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:22.880
 And he was, he was let back in.

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:27.880
 They started debating it 170 years before they decided, yes, let's remove this.

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:30.880
 We don't, like even 170 years before they thought we don't need this anymore.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:31.880
 Wow.

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:32.880
 But it took them that long to get rid of it.

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:33.880
 I just love that.

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:34.880
 Amazing.

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:35.880
 That's very good.

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:44.880
 In 2018, Norway police said to graduates that they should refrain from running naked across bridges or having sex on roundabouts.

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.880
 Which was weird because none of them had ever done it, right?

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:50.880
 Apparently, this is the thing in Norway called the Russ.

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:55.880
 And it's basically when you graduate, you just have a big old party.

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:56.880
 Wow.

00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:04.880
 And you might sort of get in a bus, a Russ bus and drive around Norway and like go on a big old pub crawl along the whole country.

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:05.880
 Cos Mayhem.

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:06.880
 Yeah.

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:07.880
 Just like a vengar bus.

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:15.880
 And they came up with a new law about two or three years ago that says every group of the students has to have at least one person who isn't graduating.

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:17.880
 Who's like the designated driver.

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:18.880
 Official law.

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:19.880
 That's very clever.

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:21.880
 And they have this thing called Russ knots.

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:30.880
 So you wear your hat like a lot of places do when you graduate and you can attach things to it a bit like what they call those bracelets like a charm bracelet.

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:31.880
 So you touch things on.

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:37.880
 So if you spend the night in a tree, you're allowed to put a stick in your cat.

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:41.880
 If you eat a Big Mac hamburger in two bites.

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:42.880
 Two bites.

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:43.880
 Yeah.

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:46.880
 They're a lot smaller than they look on the adverts.

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:47.880
 Okay.

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:51.880
 But you get a little piece of Big Mac wrapping and you can put that on.

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:55.880
 If you can drink a bottle of wine in 20 minutes, you get a wine cork.

00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:05.880
 And if you can crawl through a supermarket while barking and biting customers legs, then you get a dog biscuit.

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:09.880
 Do you have to prove you can do it because I can do that.

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:10.880
 Oh yeah.

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:11.880
 I think you've got to do it.

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:12.880
 I can do it.

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:13.880
 Go on.

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:14.880
 You have to do it.

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:17.880
 I'll do it later after the wine thing.

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:21.880
 You know, if you're going to Cambridge, if you want to graduate, you have to pull someone's finger.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.880
 This is a genuine ritual they have.

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:24.880
 Oh really?

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:25.880
 Yeah.

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:26.880
 And they always fart.

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:27.880
 Wait, what's the point?

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:28.880
 Do you fart?

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:29.880
 Yeah, yeah.

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:30.880
 Pull my finger and you.

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:31.880
 That's the joke.

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:32.880
 Pull my finger.

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:33.880
 Yeah.

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:34.880
 Thank you.

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:40.880
 Well at Cambridge, four of you pull someone's finger at the same time and it's like a don, a sort of lecturer and he toes you towards the place where you get your degree.

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:43.880
 Just farting the whole way.

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:48.880
 The coolest don in the world who does a quadruple fart as the underground tell his finger.

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:58.880
 It's very hard to maintain four different notes at the same time, but it can be done.

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:02.880
 It is time for fact number three and that is Anna.

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:09.880
 My fact is that California's international wine industry was started by a samurai.

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:10.880
 Wow.

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:11.880
 Yeah.

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:15.880
 That sounds like a chat GBT made up that fact, doesn't it?

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:23.880
 Sounds like they've taken all of our facts from history and just like the Portuguese sushi industry was started by a snowman.

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:24.880
 Yeah.

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:25.880
 They shoved two random nouns together.

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:29.880
 Come up with an amazing fact in the style of popular podcast.

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:30.880
 No such thing as a fish.

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.880
 That's what I've started doing.

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:33.880
 Okay.

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:34.880
 Is he live?

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:35.880
 I outsource.

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:36.880
 No, this is a real samurai.

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:37.880
 They also have swords.

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:45.880
 I know who I'm backing in a samurai versus Finnish doctor sword fight.

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.880
 Well, it's a drunk samurai at this point because he started a vineyard.

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:49.880
 Yeah.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:51.880
 But still, this has started in 1864, this tale.

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:58.880
 And there were 19 young samurai from a part of Edo era Japan to the Kagoshima Peninsula.

00:22:58.880 --> 00:22:59.880
 And they were smuggled out.

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:03.880
 So this is when Japan was very isolationist, didn't want any contact with the outside world.

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:08.880
 But the samurai family said, you must go to the West and learn all of their technology and stuff.

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:18.880
 19 sent away, there was this one guy who was called Kanai in Nagasawa, who ended up via Scotland in California.

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:21.880
 And sorry, he was called Kanai and he went West.

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:23.880
 Probably not relevant.

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:24.880
 Nice.

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:25.880
 He did change his name.

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:26.880
 He wasn't originally called that.

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:30.880
 So maybe it was in prediction of the Kanai West that we all know and love today.

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:32.880
 Why did he go there?

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:37.880
 He went there because he basically befriended in Scotland this kind of religious cult leader called Thomas Lake Harris,

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:40.880
 who said, I think we should try and set up a vineyard in California.

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:42.880
 Can you be the guy who does all the grapes?

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:43.880
 And he did.

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:45.880
 And he became the wine king.

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:47.880
 He was known as the wine king of California.

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:50.880
 He really rocketed Californian wine sales.

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:55.880
 He was the first person ever to market Californian wine outside of America.

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:57.880
 And yeah, he was a huge deal.

00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:59.880
 It produced more than 200,000 gallons of wine a year.

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:01.880
 And he was just this samurai.

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:02.880
 Wow.

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:03.880
 When was it?

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:04.880
 This.

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:05.880
 So it was 1864 that they left.

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:08.880
 And I think it was huge by about the late 1870s.

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:09.880
 It was a big deal.

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:11.880
 Oh, so it's like basically it's gold.

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:12.880
 Gold rush era.

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:13.880
 Yeah.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:17.880
 And California was making wine before that, but this is when it really rocketed.

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:18.880
 Yeah.

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:19.880
 Very cool guy.

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:23.880
 This guy who was the guru spiritualist above him, Thomas Lake Harris.

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:25.880
 Fascinating character.

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:29.880
 He ran a thing called the Brotherhood of New Life.

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:34.880
 And he claimed that you could breathe the ether, which would give you divine air,

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:37.880
 as opposed to the actual oxygen that we have.

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:38.880
 Quick question.

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:39.880
 Sorry.

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:40.880
 Yep.

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:43.880
 How do you take an ether without breathing?

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:44.880
 Through pseudoscience.

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:48.880
 Oh, thank you.

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:49.880
 Yeah.

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:51.880
 Through bullshit.

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:52.880
 Yeah.

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:54.880
 He also thought that you could breathe through your spleen.

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:58.880
 So he said bypass the lungs and get that right to the spleen.

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:03.880
 He was an interesting and air quotes around that character.

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:06.880
 He weirdly, it was a cult he ran.

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:12.880
 He forbade alcohol from being consumed and then started a winery with the samurai.

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:17.880
 Is he the one who thought the fairies existed and even thought that he married a fairy?

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:20.880
 Oh, maybe it sounds a bit like him.

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:21.880
 I like him though.

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:23.880
 I think a lot of what he was saying was metaphor.

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:25.880
 What is breathing in the ether but Buddhism?

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:27.880
 He's basically a Buddhist, right?

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:33.880
 Saying that deep breaths, with deep breaths you can achieve spiritual harmony.

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:36.880
 And there was a journalist called Alziere Chevalier,

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:41.880
 who was this woman who was a bit of a muckraking journalist, in my view,

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:44.880
 who came and she said that they were all the people in this cult

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:48.880
 were being made to perform strange sex acts and have baths together.

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.880
 I think some of that might have been happening.

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:52.880
 Yes, and it might have been.

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:57.880
 Why are you sticking up for this cult leader?

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:02.880
 I read a couple of biographies which, fair enough, came out before she released her book in 1894,

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:04.880
 which made him sound like a really nice guy.

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:05.880
 Right.

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.880
 Yeah, they can be persuasive cult leaders though, I suppose.

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.880
 When I start my cult, you're the first person I'm coming to as a convert.

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:13.880
 You are an easy mark.

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:16.880
 I think there was a bit of weird sex stuff going on,

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:19.880
 but what they were taught is that sex would be much better in the afterlife.

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:23.880
 They would be having sex with fairies and angels and stuff like that.

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:27.880
 And I actually think that sex might have been better in the afterlife for those guys

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:34.880
 because their form of safe sex was to press very, very hard on the testicles to avoid ejaculation.

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:38.880
 But it works.

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:41.880
 I feel saying that wouldn't be fun for you.

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:43.880
 I'll try anything else.

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:46.880
 I think very, very hard is a movable feast of a phrase.

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:49.880
 I think we need to, yeah, gosh.

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:55.880
 We should say that the wine king's fortunes were taken down in the 20th century.

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:58.880
 So he remained very wealthy, like ran this huge vineyard,

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:01.880
 lots of other vineyards set up as a result,

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.880
 and then the Second World War happened,

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:06.880
 which, spoiler, wasn't good for Japanese people in America,

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:09.880
 and they all had their land taken away.

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:11.880
 But now his property has been restored,

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:16.880
 and you can still see, although it's quite singed from a recent horrible wildfire,

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:20.880
 his samurai sword, because they had to leave their swords behind in Japan

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:22.880
 when they were sent away as kids, he went back and got it,

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:27.880
 and it now hangs on the wall of this vineyard sort of shed.

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:28.880
 That's very cool.

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:29.880
 That is very cool.

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.880
 I was looking a bit into Californian wines,

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:37.880
 and it's interesting because the origins were part of mysticism, right,

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:42.880
 this weird spiritualism, that still kind of remains in America and California.

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:44.880
 There are many wines that are grown,

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:49.880
 and everything is treated via biodynamic wine, a treatment.

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:50.880
 What's that?

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:53.880
 This is a thing that was created by a man called Rudolf Steiner,

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:56.880
 who is also the reason that I never graduated,

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:58.880
 because I went to a Rudolf Steiner school,

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.880
 and they didn't let me graduate.

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:02.880
 They were giving you wine every day, weren't they?

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:04.880
 Yeah, I was too pissed to show up to graduation.

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.880
 You told us that instead of learning history,

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:09.880
 you learned about holding a vibrating metal pole,

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:11.880
 and I don't know if you were joking.

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:12.880
 I think you probably were.

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:13.880
 No, not instead.

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:17.880
 I do history class, and then I do holding a vibrating metal pole class afterwards.

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:19.880
 It's called urythmi, it's a dance.

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:20.880
 Anyone done urythmi?

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.880
 No, okay.

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:24.880
 Just for the audience.

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:26.880
 Ironically, you went, "You with me?"

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:28.880
 And no one was with you.

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.880
 Yeah, okay, so this is what it's done.

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:31.880
 This is part of it.

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:34.880
 They do things like they will bury cow horns

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.880
 that's filled with fermented manure into their vineyards.

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:40.880
 They will prune and harvest based on lunar cycle,

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:43.880
 and they believe that if you use crushed quartz,

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:45.880
 it's basically homeopathy,

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:47.880
 which is used to make the wine grapes grow better.

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:51.880
 But the weird thing is there were multiple award-winning Californian wines

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:54.880
 that are grown by using the biodynamic Rudolf Steiner principles.

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:58.880
 I bet they use other normal wine-growing principles alongside them, don't they?

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:00.880
 I bet they water them and stuff, too.

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:03.880
 They are a world-winning, a lot of California wines.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:04.880
 Yeah.

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:06.880
 And that really goes back to 1976,

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:10.880
 when there was a big competition where they put all the best French wines

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:14.880
 against the load of California wines in France,

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:16.880
 and they invited a load of journalists over,

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:18.880
 and only one journalist showed up

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:21.880
 because they assumed that the French wines would win everything.

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:23.880
 It's called the Judgment of Paris,

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:26.880
 and it turned out that the Californian wines won,

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:28.880
 and they were the tastiest ones.

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:29.880
 Wait, the judges were French?

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:30.880
 They were French.

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:35.880
 One of the judges, Odette Kahn, who was the editor of a French wine magazine,

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:38.880
 she demanded her scorecard back

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.880
 because she didn't want anyone to know that she voted

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.880
 for the California wines ahead of her friend.

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:44.880
 They must have hated that.

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:47.880
 It was horrendous for France.

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:48.880
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.880
 That's so much fun.

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:53.880
 It sounds like the most fun moment for the rest of the world in history,

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:56.880
 because it was even the people who organized the contest,

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:58.880
 who were a Californian wine grower and the British guy

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.880
 who ran a wine company in France, were like,

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:03.880
 "Obviously the Californian wines are shit compared to the French wines,

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:05.880
 but we'll see what the tasters think."

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:07.880
 And the tasters were there, and they were, sorry,

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:10.880
 I almost tried a French accent then, and I retreated really fast.

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:12.880
 But they were the best wine tasters in France,

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:14.880
 and they'd taste a wine and say,

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:16.880
 "Ah, delicious, back in France again,"

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:18.880
 and it would be from the Napa Valley.

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:19.880
 Oh, I love it.

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:20.880
 And they were just great,

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:22.880
 and a bunch of them were fired from their jobs

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:26.880
 and cut out of wine societies that they were in

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:29.880
 after bringing this disgrace to France.

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:33.880
 I'm going to get off the Euro star on the way home tomorrow in Lille,

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:36.880
 and I'm going to ask them if they have any lovely Californian wine

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:38.880
 I've heard so much about.

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:39.880
 Oh, I can't wait. I can't wait.

00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:44.880
 The thing is about wine tasting is a lot of it is kind of mediup-y, isn't it?

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:48.880
 Yeah, and it doesn't really hold up to scrutiny a lot of it.

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:51.880
 There was a guy called Robert Hodgson who did a...

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:52.880
 He actually made wine,

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:55.880
 and he checked the results of a load of competitions

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:59.880
 and found that his wines, in one competition, they'd get like 95%,

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:01.880
 and then in another one, they'd get 65%,

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:03.880
 and it was exactly the same wine,

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:04.880
 and he couldn't understand why,

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:07.880
 and so he did a study where he blindfolded wine experts

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:10.880
 and gave them three different wines and said,

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:13.880
 "Can you explain what they are and give them a score out of 100?"

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:15.880
 And they gave them all different scores,

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:17.880
 but he gave them the same wine three times.

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:22.880
 And there's been another one where they gave people two glasses of wine,

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:24.880
 one was white, one was red,

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:25.880
 and then they said, "What do you think?"

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:26.880
 And they liked the red one.

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:29.880
 "Oh, yeah, there's hints of berries and there's hints of jamminess

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:30.880
 and all this kind of stuff."

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:34.880
 But actually, it was white wine with red food colouring in it,

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.880
 and they couldn't tell the difference between the two.

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:38.880
 When the temperature was the same, they couldn't tell the difference.

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:40.880
 So, whole things a sham.

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:43.880
 I wouldn't say the whole things a sham, but I think a lot of it is.

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:44.880
 Wow.

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:45.880
 Okay.

00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:49.880
 I'm going to buy that two euro wine bottle I saw earlier there.

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:51.880
 Well, that's what all other drinks is, isn't it?

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:53.880
 Exactly. This is why I stick to the hawk.

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:54.880
 And you'll be fine.

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:57.880
 Do you know what the fastest growing wine in the history of America's wine industry is?

00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:58.880
 The fastest growing wine?

00:31:58.880 --> 00:31:59.880
 Yeah.

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:00.880
 You mean physically the grapes?

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:01.880
 No, sorry.

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:06.880
 I mean, as in they sold not many, and then loads, and then loads, and then even more.

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:07.880
 Have we heard of it?

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:08.880
 Is it...?

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:09.880
 Possibly not.

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:12.880
 Oh, well, this is a shit, please.

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:14.880
 Is it a famous kind of wine?

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:15.880
 It's famous in America.

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:17.880
 It's called Two Buck Chuck.

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:18.880
 Oh, that sounds lovely.

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:23.880
 And it is white wine that costs $199 in dollars per bottle.

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:28.880
 Actually, now due to the cost of living, it is $3.49 per bottle.

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:35.880
 But for many, many years, it was started in 2002, and for probably about 15 years, they kept it under $2.

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:40.880
 And the way they did it is they just took all their off the bits that's left from all the different wine growers,

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:44.880
 and then they brought it to this factory and mixed it all together and sold it for cheap.

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:51.880
 But the thing was, their factory was in the Napa Valley, so they could put Napa Valley on all of the labels.

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:56.880
 I still don't think however cheap I'd buy a wine that had a synonym for vomit in its name.

00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:59.880
 I think we'd work on the title.

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:08.880
 The first ever vineyard planted in California was in 1769, and it was by a man who used to whip himself with spikes.

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:09.880
 Okay.

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:15.880
 This was because wines were often grown, as you know in Belgium similarly with beer, by weird religious people.

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:17.880
 And he was one of them.

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:27.880
 And this was in San Diego, and he was a guy called Father Junipero Serra, which is weird because his name is Juniper, which is gin.

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:29.880
 And Serra is a kind of wine.

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:31.880
 Serra is a kind of wine.

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:33.880
 I mean, he's all over the place.

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:41.880
 And yeah, he was a Franciscan monk, and he planted the very first Californian vines, and they were the main ones growing for about 100 years.

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:48.880
 But he also used to wear sackcloths with lots of spikes on the inside that jammed into him as he walked.

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:52.880
 You know what? The first monk to turn that inside out were the spikes on the outside.

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:55.880
 That was punk. That was punk.

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:58.880
 Like, it rhymes with monk, it's punk.

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:03.880
 And the Monarch for whether you're talking to a monk or a punk.

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:16.880
 All right, we do need to get to our final fact of the show. It is time for our final fact of the show, and that is James.

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:22.880
 Okay, my fact this week is that some donkeys keep sheep in their pockets.

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:23.880
 Now.

00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:25.880
 There we are.

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:27.880
 There's a picture on the screen.

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:29.880
 Anna, why don't you describe what you're looking at?

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:36.880
 What I'm seeing is a donkey with pockets, wearing a coat with pockets to be fair, and some really cute lambs poking out of them.

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:37.880
 Why are they doing that?

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:47.880
 Well, they are being taken to high pastures to the top of mountains where they can feed, and it's very difficult to transport newborn lambs.

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:53.880
 Because you can't really, you can't put them on a car because the roads aren't so good, like a four by four, I guess, or something like that.

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:57.880
 But actually the donkeys are really good at getting up the mountains.

00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:00.880
 And so you want to put your sheep with your donkeys.

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:05.880
 And a donkey realistically is quite difficult for a donkey to carry a sheep.

00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:10.880
 So it needs to have some kind of outfit where you've got little pockets where you can put the sheep in.

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:11.880
 It is adorable.

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:14.880
 And this happens in Lombardy, a good wine region.

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:15.880
 Right.

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:17.880
 Apparently not, not anymore.

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:24.880
 And they have these little, they can stick their heads out so they can see where they're going because they think very sweet.

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:26.880
 They might get travel sick or something otherwise.

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:28.880
 Yeah, so nice.

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:30.880
 Donkeys have a lot of different uses.

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:31.880
 Oh, yeah.

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:35.880
 You can name an activity and a donkey can help.

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:36.880
 Golf.

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:37.880
 Golf.

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:38.880
 Yeah.

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:40.880
 Oh, yeah.

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:41.880
 Caddy.

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:42.880
 The donkey caddy.

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:43.880
 Okay.

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:45.880
 I picked, I actually picked quite an easy one.

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:46.880
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:49.880
 Unfortunately, that's the first activity that comes into my head in all circumstances.

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:50.880
 Okay.

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.880
 Well, there are guard donkeys in France.

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:57.880
 There's a bit of the Atlantic coast, which is called Poitou Charotte.

00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:04.880
 And there are guard donkeys there because France has a lot more wolves than it, well, lots of Europe has a lot more wolves than it used to.

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:14.880
 They've been reintroduced and they can sometimes prey on sheep, not in Poitou Charotte where the donkeys are so aggressive and so big and so frightening.

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:19.880
 And they will, they will find a wolf and run towards it and kick it in the head that the wolves just don't even try anymore.

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:20.880
 Right.

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:21.880
 Wow.

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:23.880
 These are bigger donkeys than an average donkey.

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:25.880
 They are larger than the average donkey.

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:26.880
 Yeah.

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:27.880
 Great.

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:28.880
 Because otherwise it's embarrassing.

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:31.880
 I think it's a wolf to go back to your pack and say, there was a donkey.

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:32.880
 Oh, it's embarrassing either way.

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:33.880
 Yeah.

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:34.880
 Well, a donkey.

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:35.880
 He's massive.

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:36.880
 He's massive.

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:37.880
 It's more like a horse.

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:38.880
 Yeah.

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:41.880
 So there's a story about the donkeys.

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:43.880
 Beehives used to be transported by donkeys.

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:48.880
 So they would put wooden hives on the side of them and they would, I guess, walk very carefully towards where they were going.

00:36:48.880 --> 00:37:01.880
 There's a story which kind of has like bled into legend, but I will continue to talk despite being a factual podcast where supposedly the relics of saints, if they were transporting them, a donkey would transport it.

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:05.880
 Because donkeys obviously very tied in to religious iconography.

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:06.880
 Right.

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:07.880
 Jesus, you know, there was a donkey in the manger.

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:09.880
 According to the main story and so on.

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:12.880
 And so Jesus rode on a donkey on paths and days.

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:13.880
 Yeah.

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:14.880
 So it's very much that.

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:16.880
 So the idea was that if you were taking.

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:17.880
 Sorry.

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:21.880
 Can I just say I don't think the donkey was in the manger so much as beside it looking at.

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:23.880
 I think Jesus was on his own in the manger.

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:24.880
 What is the manger?

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:25.880
 It's the crib, isn't it?

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:26.880
 Yeah.

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:29.880
 I thought the crib was the crib and the manger was the room.

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:32.880
 God, he would have stuffed all those farm animals straight into the crib.

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:36.880
 Well, that's why my nativity play was received very badly at school.

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:39.880
 And it was controversial.

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:46.880
 There is a song actually of a Christmas, which is Little Donkey, which is about how their Jesus, Mary and Joseph are going to Bethlehem.

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:49.880
 And Mary sits on the donkey and goes along.

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:50.880
 Okay.

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:52.880
 And Jesus is going inside Mary's tummy at that point.

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:53.880
 Yes, absolutely.

00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:54.880
 Yes.

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:57.880
 But actually women did not ride donkeys in those days in the Holy Land.

00:37:57.880 --> 00:37:58.880
 Really?

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:00.880
 Only men would ride donkeys.

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:04.880
 So the man would have been on while the woman, even though she was pregnant, would have been walking behind.

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:05.880
 No.

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:06.880
 Generally speaking.

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:07.880
 Wow.

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:08.880
 Wow.

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:09.880
 That is the one problem.

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:10.880
 Not really.

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:14.880
 If you're Joseph, you're going, I don't even know whose baby this is anyway.

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:18.880
 How does this happen, love?

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:19.880
 Keep walking.

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:20.880
 Yeah.

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:27.880
 And actually, if you look at a donkey from above today, most donkeys, they've got like,

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:32.880
 they've got some hair that goes across their shoulders and then they've got a line of hair that goes across their back.

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:34.880
 And it looks like a cross.

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:35.880
 That's another reason why it's quite religious.

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:36.880
 Sign of the cross.

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:37.880
 That's great.

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:38.880
 Is that why it's called the mange?

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:39.880
 What?

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:40.880
 Is that what it's called?

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:41.880
 It's called the mane.

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:42.880
 It's not called the mange.

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:44.880
 Unless you've got a mangy donkey.

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:45.880
 Wait, wait.

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:47.880
 Aren't we away in a manger here?

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:49.880
 Are we trying to say there's no link?

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:53.880
 Are we trying to say Dan's just misheard something and not understood it?

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:54.880
 Yes, we are.

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:55.880
 Carry on.

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:58.880
 I wish I graduated.

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:03.880
 In Britain, one of our main hobbies is preserving the lives of elderly donkeys.

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:04.880
 It's a big thing.

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:08.880
 It's a big, like, lots of big donkey charities in the UK.

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:10.880
 Do you have big donkey charities here?

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:15.880
 Like, basically, if you watch TV in the middle of the day, then there'll be an advertisement saying,

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:18.880
 "Please leave all your money to a donkey sanctuary when you die."

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:20.880
 And people do in their thousands.

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:22.880
 They leave all their money to the donkeys.

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:29.880
 So you guys, who do old sad people leave their money to when they die if not to donkey sanctuaries?

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:34.880
 I literally don't understand where all that money would go if you didn't have donkey sanctuaries as an option.

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:36.880
 It's what happens to all of it.

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:37.880
 You guys are weird.

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:46.880
 I went to the donkey sanctuary barmouth website and I had some just great donkey facts that I have not checked.

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:52.880
 But fact number two, donkeys can see all four feet at the same time.

00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:54.880
 I have checked that and it's not true.

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:55.880
 Have you?

00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:56.880
 Yeah, I have.

00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:58.880
 Also, why did you start with fact number two?

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:02.880
 Fact number one was even more boring than that one, if you can imagine that.

00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:05.880
 We don't have to stick to the sanctuary's numbering system.

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:06.880
 Fact number 12.

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:13.880
 This is when I realised this list of donkey facts was suspicious.

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:20.880
 A donkey's prey will carry up to 60 miles in the desert.

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:25.880
 I just don't think that can be true.

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:27.880
 It doesn't seem very likely, does it?

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:28.880
 60 miles!

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:31.880
 Is that donkey to donkey though or to human?

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:34.880
 Is it like, you know how dogs can hear a different, higher sound?

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:38.880
 You'd think that it would not be audible to predator animals.

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:43.880
 Like, there's a donkey 57 miles that way.

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:47.880
 Just a little announcement that might have got passed a lot of people.

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:51.880
 Sadly, we lost one of the great donkeys this year, this January.

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:52.880
 No.

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:53.880
 Yeah, Perry.

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:56.880
 Perry the donkey has passed away age 30.

00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:00.880
 Perry was the inspiration for donkey from Shrek.

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:02.880
 That was a real donkey.

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:05.880
 And when you see a photo, it looks exactly like donkey from Shrek.

00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:07.880
 It's a donkey, yeah, he's a donkey.

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:10.880
 But his big, big old face, nose, tiny.

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:11.880
 It's a donkey.

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:17.880
 Yeah, Perry was originally sent to California to help calm polo ponies.

00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:20.880
 So he would be calm them down and keep them chilled.

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:24.880
 But things went bad when he bit every single one of them.

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:27.880
 Which is so Shrek donkey, right?

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:28.880
 Also, good on him.

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:30.880
 You pretentious dickheads playing polo.

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:32.880
 That's what I do to polo players.

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:34.880
 Wow.

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:39.880
 Do you know what the biggest global threat to donkey welfare is at the moment?

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:40.880
 Big horse.

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:42.880
 Just one big horse?

00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:43.880
 The horse industry.

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:44.880
 The horse industry.

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:45.880
 They're competing.

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:47.880
 People aren't breeding donkeys anymore.

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:50.880
 People banning, riding on them at the seaside.

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:54.880
 Is it like the overweight children on Blackpool Beach trying to ride donkeys?

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:56.880
 Because I know they have caused a problem.

00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:57.880
 They have banned them.

00:41:57.880 --> 00:41:58.880
 It is not that.

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:05.880
 It is China consume something called Ejio, which is a gelatin you make from donkey's skin.

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:09.880
 And it's supposed to be good for you due to Chinese medicine in various different ways.

00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:11.880
 In China, there were lots of donkeys there.

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:13.880
 People are using them to move things around.

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:15.880
 And so actually they have quite a lot of donkeys there.

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:18.880
 But more recently, when China has become more industrialized,

00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:20.880
 people don't have donkeys anymore.

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:23.880
 So they have to get their donkey skin from other countries.

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:27.880
 And they're importing loads and loads of donkey skins, especially from Africa.

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:34.880
 And the number of donkeys in Botswana fell by 60% in the five years between 2011 and 2016.

00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:35.880
 Yikes.

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:36.880
 Fifth in Lesotho.

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:40.880
 And the price of donkey skins is going through the roof at the moment.

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:43.880
 If you had a thousand pounds at the start of 2017,

00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:46.880
 and you invested it in donkey skins for the first six months,

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:48.880
 and Bitcoin for the second six months,

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:51.880
 you would have ended up with £25,000,

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:56.880
 which would have been enough to buy a pair of cufflinks owned by Elvis.

00:42:56.880 --> 00:43:00.880
 Again, you always guilt the lily train.

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:03.880
 There was a sale that year of Elvis.

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:06.880
 Wait, sorry, is that £1,000 to £25?

00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:07.880
 Yeah.

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:11.880
 And you simply needed to be an expert in the field both of donkey skin and Bitcoin.

00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:12.880
 Yeah.

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:14.880
 And get the time in exactly right.

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:15.880
 Of course.

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:17.880
 Laura of Everett did someone well have done that.

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:18.880
 Yeah.

00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:21.880
 I think donkey meat is quite a delicacy in China,

00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:29.880
 although the Chinese branch of Walmart had to recall a bunch of five-spice donkey meat products in 2014.

00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:32.880
 But that was because they tested them and they were full of Fox DNA,

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:35.880
 which is not a delicacy.

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:38.880
 So what, the donkeys have been eating foxes?

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:42.880
 No, I don't think we're blaming the donkeys for contaminating the donkeys.

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:46.880
 We had the thing in the UK where beef products, like beef lasagna,

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:50.880
 turned out to be containing horse and donkey as well.

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:51.880
 Oh, was it?

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:53.880
 And so donkey meat then containing Fox.

00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:55.880
 So what's in my Fox Burgers?

00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:56.880
 That's what I want to know.

00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:00.880
 It's the old woman who swallowed the fly, but the other way.

00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:03.880
 Guys, I need to wrap us up in a saying.

00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:05.880
 Do you have Lyme disease here?

00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:06.880
 What do you call it, that?

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:08.880
 Okay, so really dangerous, obviously.

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:09.880
 You get it from a tick.

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:13.880
 You get bitten by a tick and it creates really bad for you Lyme disease.

00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:19.880
 Anyway, so little bloodsuckers, donkeys and horses secrete this natural compound,

00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:22.880
 which ticks can't cope with.

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:23.880
 They hate it.

00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:27.880
 So if you wrap yourself in a live donkey, you will be safe.

00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:28.880
 A live donkey?

00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:30.880
 I think it has to be a living donkey.

00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:31.880
 Yeah, yeah.

00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:35.880
 How long is it going to be alive when you've wrapped it around yourself?

00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:39.880
 You are going to need a fresh donkey after a little while, I think.

00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:40.880
 Wow.

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:44.880
 Anyway, just a tip for you there.

00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:46.880
 And if you do die from Lyme disease,

00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:52.880
 consider donating all of your money to a donkey sanctuary, people of Belgium.

00:44:52.880 --> 00:45:00.880
 That is it.

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:01.880
 That is all of our facts.

00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:04.880
 Thank you all of you for coming and sitting here and listening to us here

00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:06.880
 at the Nerdland Festival.

00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:08.880
 If you want to get in contact with any of us,

00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:09.880
 we're all on social media.

00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:12.880
 I'm on @Tribaland on Instagram, Andy.

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:15.880
 @AndrewHunterM, various.

00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:17.880
 James.

00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:21.880
 No such thing as James Huck and equally various.

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:24.880
 Okay, and Anna, to get to us as a group.

00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:28.880
 You can email podcast@qi.com and that's just on email.

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:31.880
 And then on Instagram, where I know such thing as a fish.

00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:33.880
 And on Twitter, I know such thing.

00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:35.880
 Yeah, and obviously we have a website.

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:37.880
 No such thing as a fish.com.

00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:40.880
 If you want to check out all our previous episodes, go hang out there.

00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:44.880
 But main thing is to say, thank you for having us for a third year in a row, Nerdland.

00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:45.880
 We've really loved it.

00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:47.880
 We will see you again hopefully next year.

00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:50.880
 Until then, goodbye.

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:52.880
 (Applause)

00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:54.880
 (Music)

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:56.880
 (Music)

00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:58.880
 (Music)

00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:01.460
 (upbeat music)

00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:11.460
