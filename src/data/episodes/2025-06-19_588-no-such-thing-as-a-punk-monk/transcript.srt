00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:18,840
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

3
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:24,480
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from the Nerdland Festival in Belgium!

4
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:32,280
 [Cheering]

5
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:40,200
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin,

6
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,880
 and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

7
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,920
 and in no particular order, here we go!

8
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,160
 Starting with fact number one, and that is my fact,

9
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,880
 my fact this week is that there are more scientific papers on dung beetles

10
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:04,480
 than there are on preventing the extinction of mankind.

11
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,640
 Wow!

12
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,800
 Yeah, so...

13
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,120
 I've got a little spider just walking on the side of the table here, look at that, oh he's on my finger!

14
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:11,880
 Very nice.

15
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,200
 All I'm saying is it's not weird to be interested in insects.

16
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:15,880
 Yes.

17
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,120
 That spider's come for this fact, absolutely loving it.

18
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,880
 No, this is a brilliant new book coming out, it's coming out in July,

19
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,720
 it's called The Anti-Catastrophe League by Tom Off,

20
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:31,480
 and it's basically a look into all the people globally who are trying to stop us from going extinct.

21
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,520
 How do we survive a super volcano?

22
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,640
 How do we survive asteroid attacks?

23
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,800
 How do we survive AI if it gets too intelligent?

24
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,200
 He goes around the world and he meets all the people who are dedicating their lives to doing it,

25
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,120
 and as one of the little nuggets in there,

26
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,280
 he brings up a little fact by a guy called Nick Bostrom,

27
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:54,600
 who's quite a famous scientist and is a big player in this kind of existential risk thing,

28
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,320
 where he says, yeah, basically if you look into the literature,

29
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,400
 there's more on dung beetles in scientific literature than there is on surviving.

30
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,840
 Is there anything on how dung beetles might cause us to go extinct?

31
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,480
 Oh, good question.

32
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,040
 Or help us avoid it!

33
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,520
 That's not immediately make them the villains of the piece.

34
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,200
 If the dung beetles went on strike, then...

35
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,640
 - Yeah, we'd be up to our necks and... - Exactly.

36
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,120
 - We'd be in the shit, literally. - Yeah.

37
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,440
 - So we need to kill all dung beetles? - No.

38
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,080
 - Okay, that's what it sounded like. - So how is the world going to end according to your mate?

39
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,880
 I mean, there are so many different ways.

40
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:38,280
 I should just say, just for context, in 2018, there was a Google scholar search

41
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,560
 which showed 1,830 results for dung beetle-based papers,

42
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:49,360
 as opposed to 449 for human extinction and 940 for terms like existential risk and so on.

43
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,440
 It's more a metaphor for the fact that we're focusing more on things like insects

44
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,040
 than we are on these bigger problems.

45
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,000
 Well, that's because dung beetles exist, so they're easy to study.

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,280
 - The end of the world doesn't exist. - Yes, that's largely...

47
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,720
 And as far as we're concerned, it never will.

48
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,080
 Well, the end of humanity, sorry, not the end of the world.

49
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,920
 It really pisses me off when humans do this.

50
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,280
 The world doesn't give a shit if we go extinct.

51
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,160
 The world's just going to keep on turning.

52
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,480
 And I think quite a lot of the people who look into it are talking about things

53
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,480
 that are so unlikely, aren't they, that you think like there was that...

54
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,400
 - What kind of stuff, yeah. - So, there was an open letter

55
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,880
 written by a bunch of scientists recently, I think 38 of the world's leading scientists,

56
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,600
 Nobel Prize winners and the like, wrote an open letter with a warning,

57
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,760
 "Stop trying to create the mirror image of life on Earth,

58
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,560
 because it will wipe us all out."

59
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,880
 So, very dumb-down version, all proteins made of amino acids

60
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,120
 which are left-handed, which is just all about the way they spin,

61
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,960
 we don't really know why all life is built out of these left-handed amino acids.

62
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:50,400
 But scientists can now synthesise in labs right-handed amino acids,

63
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,040
 and that could be super useful for lots of things that can make better drugs,

64
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,640
 so it could really, like, it could defeat a lot of sort of natural biological things,

65
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,320
 but it could also wipe us all out,

66
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:05,080
 because basically, if you get a right-handed bacteria that we've created in a lab,

67
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,920
 nothing has evolved to beat it.

68
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,920
 A right-handed bacteria attacks our bodies and our bodies don't even recognise it.

69
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,000
 - They don't even see it. It's invisible. - It's like a left-handed cricketer.

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,440
 - Or a tennis player. - It's Nadal.

71
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,600
 - Are they invisible? - They're unbeatable, yeah.

72
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,320
 Unbeatable. There you go. You can't play them.

73
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,720
 Another thing that's similar to that is a thing called strange matter,

74
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,200
 and this is if you get nuclear stuff and you squash it down, squash it down, squash it down,

75
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,800
 it can turn into this thing called strange matter,

76
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,240
 and if it comes and touches normal matter, then they can annihilate each other,

77
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:42,080
 and that thing that might happen is known as a strange conversation.

78
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,840
 And apparently, if you get a strange conversation happening anywhere in the universe,

79
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,160
 that could be the end of everything.

80
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,320
 It feels like we should be annihilating each other all the time, what are you saying?

81
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,320
 That's so funny.

82
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,800
 So there are big groups that are trying to work out how to save us all,

83
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,320
 and in 2005, this guy mentioned Nick Bostrom, who's a big best-selling author,

84
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,760
 he's a big name in science, he founded the Future of Humanity Institute,

85
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,720
 and when they look at these bigger problems, how are we going to survive as a species?

86
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,000
 So it was him, there's another guy who joined, called Anders Sandberg,

87
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,720
 very interesting character, Swedish scientist,

88
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,680
 he developed a bunch of ideas that he's been putting forward in the science world,

89
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,520
 but my favorite thing is he wrote a paper that asked the question,

90
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,920
 "What if the entire Earth was instantaneously replaced

91
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:32,080
 with an equal volume of closely packed but uncompressed blueberries?"

92
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,560
 Okay.

93
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,400
 He picked big, thick-skinned, high-bush blueberries,

94
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,840
 because he thought that was best for it.

95
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,080
 And so what's going to happen?

96
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,720
 It's a very hostile world, James.

97
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,720
 Wait, it's not good.

98
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,000
 Oh, I was going to guess nothing at all happens,

99
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,080
 because that's the answer half the time, because it would...

100
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,920
 Small blueberry farmers go out of business quite quickly.

101
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,480
 That's true, that's true.

102
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,680
 No, he said if you were standing on blueberries,

103
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,440
 it might be possible, in theory, that we could survive.

104
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,840
 However, almost immediately, they would begin to compress rapidly,

105
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,040
 and then air would start erupting everywhere,

106
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,720
 causing great earthquakes,

107
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,600
 and then the entire environment would be completely filled

108
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,240
 by boiling jam and steam,

109
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,280
 and we would live in just a big, crazy jam world.

110
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,360
 But is this... Sorry, has he got funding to find out that this is a bad idea?

111
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,440
 Yeah, and you're saying there should be more papers like this?

112
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,480
 I'm saying this is the co-founder of an institution

113
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,920
 that's looking to work out how we survive into infinity.

114
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,880
 Okay, so he was the co-founder with Nick Bostrom.

115
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,680
 Yeah, Bostrom, yeah.

116
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,240
 So one of Nick Bostrom's idea is the paperclip maximiser.

117
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,000
 Oh, yeah.

118
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,520
 And that is that you come up with an AI, and you say to that AI,

119
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,680
 "What we need is paperclips."

120
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,480
 But you don't give it any other instructions, you say to it,

121
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,280
 "Whatever you do, make as many paperclips as you can."

122
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,560
 And if you do that, they'll quickly realise

123
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,480
 that if they make too many paperclips,

124
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,640
 then the humans might come and turn the machine off,

125
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,240
 so they immediately decide to kill all the humans,

126
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,840
 because they don't want to get turned off.

127
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,360
 And then they also realise that humans are made out of carbon

128
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,120
 and lots of different metals and stuff.

129
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,120
 And actually, we're quite good paperclip material.

130
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,440
 And so what you end up is the world with no humans,

131
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,080
 but a ton of paperclips.

132
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,640
 Pick up your paperclips with this little eye looking back like that.

133
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,600
 It looks like you're trying to end the world.

134
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,680
 Very nice.

135
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,520
 It's beautiful.

136
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,920
 And the idea is that it would then go,

137
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,440
 "Well, we should make everything in the universe paperclips."

138
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,040
 And it would take over planets and set up paperclip factories

139
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,800
 and make more until all of existence was one big paperclip.

140
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,320
 Actually, I wrote to Nick Bostrom, the scientist, a few years ago,

141
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,920
 because I was researching something about the end of the world

142
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,800
 and I wanted his opinion of it.

143
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,240
 And he just sent me a rather nice line.

144
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,920
 I think you might like this.

145
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,280
 He said, "Some of our biggest problems

146
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,440
 are primarily political and ethical,

147
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,320
 and they'll need solutions in those realms.

148
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:50,280
 For a great future, we really need both capability and love.

149
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,240
 But if we could only have one, I'd pick love,

150
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,760
 and I would pick capability, personally."

151
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,800
 I think he's going to be disappointed from that,

152
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,760
 because I think he was flirting with you.

153
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,120
 Oh, no!

154
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,600
 That was effectively a swipe last day, Andy.

155
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,440
 You know, the good news about the end of the world,

156
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,480
 if you think about it, is...

157
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,960
 So, what's one of the ideas for defeating it?

158
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,040
 Well, there's a guy you might not have heard of called Elon Musk,

159
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,760
 who talks a lot about terraforming Mars

160
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,640
 as being a way that humans could escape and go to another place.

161
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,200
 What's the main problem with Mars,

162
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,360
 the thing we need to do to it, to make it liveable?

163
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,800
 Like, everything.

164
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,040
 We need to stop all the radiation.

165
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,760
 Loads of stuff, yeah.

166
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,760
 Get rid of the aliens.

167
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,760
 OK.

168
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,240
 (LAUGHTER)

169
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,000
 Loads of stuff, not including that.

170
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,080
 But one of the big things is make it warmer,

171
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,520
 and we already know how to warm a planet.

172
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,480
 Oh! Oh, terrific!

173
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,560
 So, and as Elon Musk has planned,

174
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,280
 he has a plan to drop hydrogen bombs into the atmosphere above Mars

175
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,440
 every few seconds, and that will release the carbon dioxide

176
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,080
 trapped in Mars' ice caps.

177
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,440
 Would we know that carbon dioxide warmed a planet

178
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,680
 unless we'd already experimented with this one?

179
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,680
 No.

180
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,320
 So, was it all part of the game?

181
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,560
 I think it might be worth sending him up there,

182
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,760
 maybe with his ex-best mate.

183
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,640
 (LAUGHTER)

184
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,880
 Wow.

185
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,880
 Have done beetles?

186
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,880
 Oh, yeah. Yeah.

187
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,880
 They don't just eat dung.

188
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,880
 OK, get out.

189
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,880
 Yeah.

190
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,880
 Some of them eat fungi.

191
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,880
 Some of them eat rotting fruits.

192
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,880
 Some of them eat carrion.

193
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,880
 I mean, none of them eat burgers.

194
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,880
 It's all pretty disgusting stuff.

195
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,880
 Decapitated millipedes.

196
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,880
 I read about that one.

197
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,880
 It's a dung beetle in Peru.

198
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,880
 It has given up eating poo,

199
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,880
 and they all have this kind of chisel shape on their head

200
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,880
 to shape the poo into a ball,

201
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,880
 which is what they normally do.

202
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,880
 But this one in Peru, it has given up eating poo,

203
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,880
 and it uses its chisel to decapitate millipedes.

204
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,880
 So, at what point?

205
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,880
 That's an evolutionary question.

206
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,880
 It's just one dung beetle.

207
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,880
 He goes, "Wait a minute."

208
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,880
 This is delicious, compared with what I've been eating my whole life.

209
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,880
 Also, they don't eat very large pieces of poo.

210
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,880
 (LAUGHTER)

211
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,880
 They're very fussy eaters,

212
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,880
 and they have a bad reputation as being like the slobs.

213
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,880
 Dung beetles specifically pick out

214
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,880
 nitrogen-rich, tiny particles inside poo.

215
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,880
 So, actually, they hate the big bits of poo.

216
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,880
 But they're picking particles two thousandths of a millimetre big.

217
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,880
 That's not a sizeable meal.

218
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,880
 So, is there actually any poo in that?

219
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,880
 It's all poo.

220
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,880
 It's all poo.

221
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,880
 No, because sometimes when I poo, there's corn in it.

222
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,880
 Oh, my God.

223
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,880
 You're going to get extra materials.

224
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,880
 It's all poo once it's part of the poo.

225
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,880
 I think I'm not going to dance, Rastron.

226
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,880
 You know, a single elephant can maintain two million dung beetles.

227
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,880
 Oh, nice.

228
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,880
 That is good.

229
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,880
 But then if that one elephant dies, then they're all out of business.

230
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,880
 Are they alive?

231
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,880
 That's true.

232
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,880
 Yes.

233
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,880
 It's like a Trojan elephant kind of situation.

234
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,880
 No, they're not inside it.

235
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,880
 Oh, sorry.

236
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,880
 (LAUGHTER)

237
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,880
 What did you say?

238
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,880
 What did you say?

239
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,880
 (LAUGHTER)

240
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,880
 I said, "Sustain, not contain."

241
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,880
 (LAUGHTER)

242
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,880
 The onphophagous taurus, the bull-headed dung beetle,

243
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,880
 it's kind of the poster boy for dung beetles.

244
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,880
 They can pull dung 1,000 times their body weight.

245
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,880
 Wow.

246
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,880
 Which is the equivalent of me being able to pull

247
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,880
 an entire right whale's testicle made of poo.

248
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,880
 Ah!

249
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,880
 How relatable for everyone.

250
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,880
 (LAUGHTER)

251
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,880
 Thank you.

252
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,880
 (MUSIC)

253
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,880
 It is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

254
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:39,880
 My fact is, new Finnish doctors are officially issued with a sword.

255
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:43,880
 Short doctors get a short sword, and tall doctors get a long sword.

256
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,880
 Oh.

257
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,880
 And it's if you get a doctorate of medicine or philosophy or whatever,

258
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,880
 you get to wear a nice top hat, which we don't have in the UK.

259
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,880
 You see, because when you said this,

260
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,880
 I thought you meant doctors as medical doctors.

261
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,880
 It is medical doctors, but it's also, it's getting a doctorate.

262
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,880
 It's graduating, basically.

263
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,880
 Graduating, yes.

264
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,880
 So fine arts, probably business, PhDs, whatever it is.

265
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,880
 And if you're under a certain height, you get a 76-centimeter sword.

266
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,880
 If you're a bit taller, you get an 81-centimeter sword.

267
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,880
 It's not a huge difference.

268
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,880
 The night before you graduate, you go to a traditional sword wetting ceremony,

269
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,880
 where you have to go and sharpen your own sword.

270
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,880
 That's wet.

271
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,880
 Wetting.

272
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,880
 Wetting.

273
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,880
 I think you need to wet it a little bit as part of the hotting.

274
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,880
 So that wetting in this case means sort of grinding it down.

275
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,880
 Sharpening it on a grindstone.

276
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,880
 That's cool.

277
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,880
 And it's a whole process, right?

278
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,880
 Like, you apply for it, you give your name,

279
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,880
 which gets etched into the side of it.

280
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,880
 It has the date of your graduation, I believe, there as well.

281
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,880
 And the hat is the only difference.

282
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,880
 That's how you tell what they're graduating from.

283
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,880
 So they wear a hat?

284
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,880
 They all wear top hats.

285
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,880
 They are also bespoke hats made on the front of them.

286
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,880
 There's a little gold emblem that shows the faculties and so on that they're connected to.

287
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,880
 And so if you're a doctor of fine arts, you'll get a dark blue hat.

288
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,880
 But if you're a doctor of law, you get crimson.

289
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,880
 So that's how you tell the different doctorates apart.

290
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,880
 Apparently that idea comes back from the University of Uppsala,

291
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,880
 which is in Sweden, not Finland.

292
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,880
 And some students went to Finland from Uppsala and they were wearing purple berets.

293
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,880
 But they were like, "Oh, they look really great. Let's do that."

294
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,880
 And Uppsala got their idea from the Romans.

295
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,880
 And the idea was if you were a freed slave, you would get a red hat.

296
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,880
 It all goes back all the way to that.

297
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,880
 And speaking of Uppsala, by the way, at 10 p.m. every night,

298
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,880
 the students in Uppsala open their windows and start screaming.

299
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,880
 And nobody knows why.

300
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,880
 Every night?

301
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,880
 Every night.

302
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,880
 But someone needs to ask them.

303
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,880
 Well, they do it because their predecessors have done it

304
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,880
 and their predecessors have done it.

305
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,880
 But the reason that the original ones did it is lost to the midst of time.

306
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,880
 Right.

307
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,880
 Do you know how long they've been doing it?

308
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,880
 Since the '70s.

309
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,880
 Oh, okay.

310
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,880
 Since the '70s.

311
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,880
 Since, okay, someone must be alive there from the '70s.

312
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,880
 But I think a lot was happening in the '70s

313
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,880
 that people don't really know why they were doing it.

314
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,880
 Yeah, right.

315
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,880
 They're all jogged up to their eyeballs.

316
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,880
 Got it.

317
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,880
 They didn't know why at the time.

318
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,880
 What did you guys do when you graduated?

319
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,880
 I can't remember.

320
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,880
 Nothing.

321
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,880
 I really can't.

322
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,880
 I've tried to remember the ceremony because I was researching this fact.

323
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,880
 I can't remember the day.

324
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,880
 I can't remember being there.

325
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,880
 Really?

326
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,880
 I have a memory of watching myself graduate from up high in the thing.

327
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,880
 But that can't be right.

328
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,880
 Well, so that maybe you nearly died?

329
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,880
 I didn't have an out-of-body experience.

330
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,880
 I did die.

331
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,880
 Okay.

332
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,880
 No, I just can't recall it at all.

333
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,880
 Yeah, I just can't remember either.

334
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,880
 Really?

335
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,880
 Yeah.

336
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,880
 I can't either.

337
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,880
 You didn't graduate.

338
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,880
 That's true, by the way.

339
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,880
 I just think it's not as big a thing.

340
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,880
 I mean, I didn't go to mine as big a thing here.

341
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,880
 It's somewhere like America where it's obviously this huge deal.

342
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:43,880
 And I like in America the massive fanfare over who's going to do the commencement speech.

343
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,880
 And there's always this struggle between all American universities to get big celebs.

344
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:52,880
 It seems so random, like Taylor Swift, JK Rowling, Bill Cosby, Robert De Niro.

345
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,880
 They're all very proud of their choices.

346
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,880
 Taylor Swift.

347
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,880
 I know, I know.

348
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,880
 A morally questionable choice, I agree.

349
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,880
 Fly me.

350
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,880
 Adam, didn't you study at Edinburgh?

351
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,880
 I think you missed a massive opportunity when you didn't go to your graduation ceremony.

352
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,880
 Did I?

353
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,880
 Everyone who graduates from Edinburgh gets tapped on the head with a hat that is made

354
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,880
 from the seat of the trousers of John Knox.

355
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,880
 Now, John Knox is not famous in the UK either.

356
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,880
 But he is important.

357
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,880
 He was the founder of the Presbyterian Church.

358
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,880
 He was a huge figure in Scottish history and Scotland's story.

359
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:36,880
 So when he died, a pair of his breeches were turned into the Geneva Bonnet.

360
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:43,880
 And now hundreds of thousands of students have been gently bonked on the head with a hat that's made of his trousers.

361
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,880
 And you missed the chance.

362
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,880
 Except about 10 years ago, they decided to do some restoration on the hat.

363
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:55,880
 And they found a note inside saying Henry Banks, 22 Duke Street, 1849.

364
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,880
 So he was supposed to have been around in the 16th century.

365
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,880
 Yeah.

366
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,880
 So it's at least 300 years younger than they claim it to be.

367
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,880
 Right.

368
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,880
 Yes.

369
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,880
 Yes.

370
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,880
 That's true.

371
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,880
 But it has been to space.

372
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,880
 It's been to space.

373
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,880
 Oh, well.

374
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,880
 Well, it hasn't been.

375
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,880
 Let me knock down your fact.

376
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,880
 It's that they tried to take it to space, didn't they?

377
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,880
 And the university said, no, you can't take these 100 year old trousers,

378
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,880
 which we're pretending are 500 years old into space.

379
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,880
 So they instead took a piece of cloth to space and then sewed it in when they got back.

380
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,880
 Nothing about this is making me regret not attending my graduation.

381
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,880
 The graduation related person, the biggest fan of his, Chuck Schumer.

382
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,880
 Are you familiar with Chuck Schumer's work in graduations?

383
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,880
 No.

384
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,880
 So Chuck Schumer, I mean, why he's a little bit like John Knox.

385
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,880
 You're like, Chuck Schumer, who is that?

386
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,880
 He's a Senate majority leader or was until very recently, a Democrat.

387
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,880
 And he's one of the people who does commencement speeches, one of the celebs.

388
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,880
 But apparently he's just does them all.

389
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,880
 So he's in New York, he's entering New York.

390
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,880
 And if you've been to uni or primary school or secondary school,

391
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,880
 got a doctorate and undergrad and masters, he's rocked up.

392
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,880
 Some people think sometimes uninvited just does the commencement speech.

393
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,880
 And there are Reddit threads of people going, I've been educated in New York.

394
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,880
 I've seen that sudden speech five times.

395
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,880
 It's always exactly the same.

396
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,880
 And apparently if you're sitting in the audience doing a PhD and you've gone through all education,

397
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,880
 you could literally just mow the long the speech with Chuck Schumer.

398
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,880
 Wow.

399
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,880
 As he says it over and over again.

400
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,880
 Wow.

401
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,880
 It's really cool.

402
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,880
 I have a favorite graduation person from America as well.

403
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,880
 Everyone does.

404
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,880
 Everyone has one.

405
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,880
 Benjamin B. Bulger.

406
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,880
 Benjamin B. Bulger, he's in his fifties now.

407
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,880
 He has graduated 17 times.

408
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,880
 Or at least he will have got his 17th very soon.

409
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,880
 And these are not from sort of like online places.

410
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,880
 He graduated from Harvard, from Brown, from Stanford, Cambridge, Oxford.

411
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,880
 I don't know if he's officially attended all 17 graduations.

412
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,880
 He's actually getting degrees.

413
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,880
 Yeah.

414
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,880
 What makes me think is getting a degree is not a good pathway to getting a job.

415
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,880
 Yeah.

416
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,880
 If he still hasn't managed to find one.

417
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,880
 But he seems at a basic character.

418
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,880
 He got expelled from preschool.

419
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,880
 He went to a school called Noah's Ark.

420
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:09,880
 And he got expelled because he kept asking too many difficult questions about the animals on the Ark.

421
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,880
 So he said, well, what are the lions?

422
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,880
 Wouldn't they get hungry?

423
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,880
 What's going to happen then?

424
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,880
 They're going to eat everything.

425
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,880
 And they just went, listen, you're out of here in preschool.

426
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,880
 Wow.

427
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,880
 Yeah.

428
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,880
 So he loves studying.

429
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,880
 He homeschools his kids.

430
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,880
 So he's called Benjamin B. Bulger.

431
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,880
 He has a son called Benjamin B. Bulger, junior.

432
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,880
 And a daughter called Benjamina.

433
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,880
 Oh, lovely name.

434
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,880
 Yeah.

435
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,880
 We got an audience fact sent in about this recently, actually.

436
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,880
 I really like this.

437
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,880
 This is from someone.

438
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,880
 This is from Neil from Shrewsbury.

439
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,880
 So thank you, Neil.

440
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,880
 Right.

441
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,880
 I love this.

442
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:55,880
 For 500 years, if you wanted to get a Master of Arts degree from Oxford University, you had to swear an oath that you would never be reconciled with Henry Simeonis.

443
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,880
 Nobody knows or knew at the time who Henry Simeonis was.

444
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,880
 But you had to swear, swear on your life, you would never make up with him, never settle the argument.

445
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:08,880
 The oath was abolished in 1827 because nobody knew what they were abolishing.

446
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,880
 And do we know now?

447
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,880
 We do know now.

448
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,880
 He killed someone.

449
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,880
 He killed someone.

450
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:18,880
 But in like 12 something, I mean, he killed someone 600 years before.

451
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,880
 It's been a long time.

452
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,880
 It's been a long time.

453
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,880
 And he was, he was let back in.

454
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,880
 They started debating it 170 years before they decided, yes, let's remove this.

455
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,880
 We don't, like even 170 years before they thought we don't need this anymore.

456
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,880
 Wow.

457
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,880
 But it took them that long to get rid of it.

458
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,880
 I just love that.

459
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,880
 Amazing.

460
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,880
 That's very good.

461
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:44,880
 In 2018, Norway police said to graduates that they should refrain from running naked across bridges or having sex on roundabouts.

462
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,880
 Which was weird because none of them had ever done it, right?

463
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,880
 Apparently, this is the thing in Norway called the Russ.

464
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,880
 And it's basically when you graduate, you just have a big old party.

465
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,880
 Wow.

466
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:04,880
 And you might sort of get in a bus, a Russ bus and drive around Norway and like go on a big old pub crawl along the whole country.

467
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,880
 Cos Mayhem.

468
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,880
 Yeah.

469
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,880
 Just like a vengar bus.

470
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:15,880
 And they came up with a new law about two or three years ago that says every group of the students has to have at least one person who isn't graduating.

471
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,880
 Who's like the designated driver.

472
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,880
 Official law.

473
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,880
 That's very clever.

474
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,880
 And they have this thing called Russ knots.

475
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:30,880
 So you wear your hat like a lot of places do when you graduate and you can attach things to it a bit like what they call those bracelets like a charm bracelet.

476
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,880
 So you touch things on.

477
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:37,880
 So if you spend the night in a tree, you're allowed to put a stick in your cat.

478
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:41,880
 If you eat a Big Mac hamburger in two bites.

479
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,880
 Two bites.

480
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,880
 Yeah.

481
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,880
 They're a lot smaller than they look on the adverts.

482
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,880
 Okay.

483
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,880
 But you get a little piece of Big Mac wrapping and you can put that on.

484
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,880
 If you can drink a bottle of wine in 20 minutes, you get a wine cork.

485
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:05,880
 And if you can crawl through a supermarket while barking and biting customers legs, then you get a dog biscuit.

486
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,880
 Do you have to prove you can do it because I can do that.

487
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,880
 Oh yeah.

488
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,880
 I think you've got to do it.

489
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,880
 I can do it.

490
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,880
 Go on.

491
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,880
 You have to do it.

492
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,880
 I'll do it later after the wine thing.

493
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,880
 You know, if you're going to Cambridge, if you want to graduate, you have to pull someone's finger.

494
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,880
 This is a genuine ritual they have.

495
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,880
 Oh really?

496
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,880
 Yeah.

497
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,880
 And they always fart.

498
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,880
 Wait, what's the point?

499
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,880
 Do you fart?

500
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,880
 Yeah, yeah.

501
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,880
 Pull my finger and you.

502
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,880
 That's the joke.

503
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,880
 Pull my finger.

504
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,880
 Yeah.

505
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,880
 Thank you.

506
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:40,880
 Well at Cambridge, four of you pull someone's finger at the same time and it's like a don, a sort of lecturer and he toes you towards the place where you get your degree.

507
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,880
 Just farting the whole way.

508
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:48,880
 The coolest don in the world who does a quadruple fart as the underground tell his finger.

509
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:58,880
 It's very hard to maintain four different notes at the same time, but it can be done.

510
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,880
 It is time for fact number three and that is Anna.

511
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:09,880
 My fact is that California's international wine industry was started by a samurai.

512
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,880
 Wow.

513
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,880
 Yeah.

514
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:15,880
 That sounds like a chat GBT made up that fact, doesn't it?

515
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:23,880
 Sounds like they've taken all of our facts from history and just like the Portuguese sushi industry was started by a snowman.

516
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,880
 Yeah.

517
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,880
 They shoved two random nouns together.

518
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,880
 Come up with an amazing fact in the style of popular podcast.

519
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,880
 No such thing as a fish.

520
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,880
 That's what I've started doing.

521
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,880
 Okay.

522
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,880
 Is he live?

523
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,880
 I outsource.

524
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,880
 No, this is a real samurai.

525
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,880
 They also have swords.

526
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:45,880
 I know who I'm backing in a samurai versus Finnish doctor sword fight.

527
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,880
 Well, it's a drunk samurai at this point because he started a vineyard.

528
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,880
 Yeah.

529
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,880
 But still, this has started in 1864, this tale.

530
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:58,880
 And there were 19 young samurai from a part of Edo era Japan to the Kagoshima Peninsula.

531
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,880
 And they were smuggled out.

532
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,880
 So this is when Japan was very isolationist, didn't want any contact with the outside world.

533
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:08,880
 But the samurai family said, you must go to the West and learn all of their technology and stuff.

534
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:18,880
 19 sent away, there was this one guy who was called Kanai in Nagasawa, who ended up via Scotland in California.

535
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,880
 And sorry, he was called Kanai and he went West.

536
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,880
 Probably not relevant.

537
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,880
 Nice.

538
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,880
 He did change his name.

539
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,880
 He wasn't originally called that.

540
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,880
 So maybe it was in prediction of the Kanai West that we all know and love today.

541
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,880
 Why did he go there?

542
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,880
 He went there because he basically befriended in Scotland this kind of religious cult leader called Thomas Lake Harris,

543
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,880
 who said, I think we should try and set up a vineyard in California.

544
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,880
 Can you be the guy who does all the grapes?

545
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,880
 And he did.

546
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,880
 And he became the wine king.

547
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,880
 He was known as the wine king of California.

548
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,880
 He really rocketed Californian wine sales.

549
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,880
 He was the first person ever to market Californian wine outside of America.

550
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,880
 And yeah, he was a huge deal.

551
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,880
 It produced more than 200,000 gallons of wine a year.

552
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,880
 And he was just this samurai.

553
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,880
 Wow.

554
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,880
 When was it?

555
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,880
 This.

556
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,880
 So it was 1864 that they left.

557
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,880
 And I think it was huge by about the late 1870s.

558
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,880
 It was a big deal.

559
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,880
 Oh, so it's like basically it's gold.

560
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,880
 Gold rush era.

561
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,880
 Yeah.

562
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,880
 And California was making wine before that, but this is when it really rocketed.

563
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,880
 Yeah.

564
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,880
 Very cool guy.

565
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,880
 This guy who was the guru spiritualist above him, Thomas Lake Harris.

566
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,880
 Fascinating character.

567
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,880
 He ran a thing called the Brotherhood of New Life.

568
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:34,880
 And he claimed that you could breathe the ether, which would give you divine air,

569
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,880
 as opposed to the actual oxygen that we have.

570
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,880
 Quick question.

571
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,880
 Sorry.

572
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,880
 Yep.

573
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,880
 How do you take an ether without breathing?

574
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,880
 Through pseudoscience.

575
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,880
 Oh, thank you.

576
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,880
 Yeah.

577
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,880
 Through bullshit.

578
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,880
 Yeah.

579
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,880
 He also thought that you could breathe through your spleen.

580
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,880
 So he said bypass the lungs and get that right to the spleen.

581
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,880
 He was an interesting and air quotes around that character.

582
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,880
 He weirdly, it was a cult he ran.

583
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:12,880
 He forbade alcohol from being consumed and then started a winery with the samurai.

584
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,880
 Is he the one who thought the fairies existed and even thought that he married a fairy?

585
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,880
 Oh, maybe it sounds a bit like him.

586
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,880
 I like him though.

587
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,880
 I think a lot of what he was saying was metaphor.

588
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,880
 What is breathing in the ether but Buddhism?

589
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,880
 He's basically a Buddhist, right?

590
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:33,880
 Saying that deep breaths, with deep breaths you can achieve spiritual harmony.

591
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,880
 And there was a journalist called Alziere Chevalier,

592
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,880
 who was this woman who was a bit of a muckraking journalist, in my view,

593
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,880
 who came and she said that they were all the people in this cult

594
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,880
 were being made to perform strange sex acts and have baths together.

595
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,880
 I think some of that might have been happening.

596
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,880
 Yes, and it might have been.

597
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,880
 Why are you sticking up for this cult leader?

598
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:02,880
 I read a couple of biographies which, fair enough, came out before she released her book in 1894,

599
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,880
 which made him sound like a really nice guy.

600
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,880
 Right.

601
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,880
 Yeah, they can be persuasive cult leaders though, I suppose.

602
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,880
 When I start my cult, you're the first person I'm coming to as a convert.

603
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,880
 You are an easy mark.

604
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,880
 I think there was a bit of weird sex stuff going on,

605
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,880
 but what they were taught is that sex would be much better in the afterlife.

606
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,880
 They would be having sex with fairies and angels and stuff like that.

607
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,880
 And I actually think that sex might have been better in the afterlife for those guys

608
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:34,880
 because their form of safe sex was to press very, very hard on the testicles to avoid ejaculation.

609
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,880
 But it works.

610
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,880
 I feel saying that wouldn't be fun for you.

611
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,880
 I'll try anything else.

612
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,880
 I think very, very hard is a movable feast of a phrase.

613
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,880
 I think we need to, yeah, gosh.

614
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:55,880
 We should say that the wine king's fortunes were taken down in the 20th century.

615
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,880
 So he remained very wealthy, like ran this huge vineyard,

616
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,880
 lots of other vineyards set up as a result,

617
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,880
 and then the Second World War happened,

618
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,880
 which, spoiler, wasn't good for Japanese people in America,

619
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,880
 and they all had their land taken away.

620
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,880
 But now his property has been restored,

621
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:16,880
 and you can still see, although it's quite singed from a recent horrible wildfire,

622
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,880
 his samurai sword, because they had to leave their swords behind in Japan

623
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,880
 when they were sent away as kids, he went back and got it,

624
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,880
 and it now hangs on the wall of this vineyard sort of shed.

625
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,880
 That's very cool.

626
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,880
 That is very cool.

627
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,880
 I was looking a bit into Californian wines,

628
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,880
 and it's interesting because the origins were part of mysticism, right,

629
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:42,880
 this weird spiritualism, that still kind of remains in America and California.

630
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,880
 There are many wines that are grown,

631
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,880
 and everything is treated via biodynamic wine, a treatment.

632
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,880
 What's that?

633
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,880
 This is a thing that was created by a man called Rudolf Steiner,

634
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,880
 who is also the reason that I never graduated,

635
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,880
 because I went to a Rudolf Steiner school,

636
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,880
 and they didn't let me graduate.

637
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,880
 They were giving you wine every day, weren't they?

638
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,880
 Yeah, I was too pissed to show up to graduation.

639
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,880
 You told us that instead of learning history,

640
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,880
 you learned about holding a vibrating metal pole,

641
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,880
 and I don't know if you were joking.

642
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,880
 I think you probably were.

643
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,880
 No, not instead.

644
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:17,880
 I do history class, and then I do holding a vibrating metal pole class afterwards.

645
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,880
 It's called urythmi, it's a dance.

646
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,880
 Anyone done urythmi?

647
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,880
 No, okay.

648
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,880
 Just for the audience.

649
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,880
 Ironically, you went, "You with me?"

650
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,880
 And no one was with you.

651
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,880
 Yeah, okay, so this is what it's done.

652
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,880
 This is part of it.

653
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,880
 They do things like they will bury cow horns

654
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,880
 that's filled with fermented manure into their vineyards.

655
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,880
 They will prune and harvest based on lunar cycle,

656
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,880
 and they believe that if you use crushed quartz,

657
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,880
 it's basically homeopathy,

658
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,880
 which is used to make the wine grapes grow better.

659
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,880
 But the weird thing is there were multiple award-winning Californian wines

660
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,880
 that are grown by using the biodynamic Rudolf Steiner principles.

661
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,880
 I bet they use other normal wine-growing principles alongside them, don't they?

662
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,880
 I bet they water them and stuff, too.

663
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,880
 They are a world-winning, a lot of California wines.

664
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,880
 Yeah.

665
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,880
 And that really goes back to 1976,

666
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,880
 when there was a big competition where they put all the best French wines

667
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,880
 against the load of California wines in France,

668
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,880
 and they invited a load of journalists over,

669
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,880
 and only one journalist showed up

670
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,880
 because they assumed that the French wines would win everything.

671
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,880
 It's called the Judgment of Paris,

672
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,880
 and it turned out that the Californian wines won,

673
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,880
 and they were the tastiest ones.

674
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,880
 Wait, the judges were French?

675
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,880
 They were French.

676
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,880
 One of the judges, Odette Kahn, who was the editor of a French wine magazine,

677
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,880
 she demanded her scorecard back

678
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,880
 because she didn't want anyone to know that she voted

679
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,880
 for the California wines ahead of her friend.

680
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,880
 They must have hated that.

681
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,880
 It was horrendous for France.

682
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,880
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

683
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,880
 That's so much fun.

684
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,880
 It sounds like the most fun moment for the rest of the world in history,

685
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,880
 because it was even the people who organized the contest,

686
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,880
 who were a Californian wine grower and the British guy

687
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,880
 who ran a wine company in France, were like,

688
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,880
 "Obviously the Californian wines are shit compared to the French wines,

689
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,880
 but we'll see what the tasters think."

690
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,880
 And the tasters were there, and they were, sorry,

691
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,880
 I almost tried a French accent then, and I retreated really fast.

692
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,880
 But they were the best wine tasters in France,

693
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,880
 and they'd taste a wine and say,

694
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,880
 "Ah, delicious, back in France again,"

695
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,880
 and it would be from the Napa Valley.

696
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,880
 Oh, I love it.

697
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,880
 And they were just great,

698
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,880
 and a bunch of them were fired from their jobs

699
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,880
 and cut out of wine societies that they were in

700
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,880
 after bringing this disgrace to France.

701
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,880
 I'm going to get off the Euro star on the way home tomorrow in Lille,

702
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,880
 and I'm going to ask them if they have any lovely Californian wine

703
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,880
 I've heard so much about.

704
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,880
 Oh, I can't wait. I can't wait.

705
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:44,880
 The thing is about wine tasting is a lot of it is kind of mediup-y, isn't it?

706
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,880
 Yeah, and it doesn't really hold up to scrutiny a lot of it.

707
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,880
 There was a guy called Robert Hodgson who did a...

708
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,880
 He actually made wine,

709
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,880
 and he checked the results of a load of competitions

710
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:59,880
 and found that his wines, in one competition, they'd get like 95%,

711
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,880
 and then in another one, they'd get 65%,

712
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,880
 and it was exactly the same wine,

713
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,880
 and he couldn't understand why,

714
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,880
 and so he did a study where he blindfolded wine experts

715
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,880
 and gave them three different wines and said,

716
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,880
 "Can you explain what they are and give them a score out of 100?"

717
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,880
 And they gave them all different scores,

718
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,880
 but he gave them the same wine three times.

719
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:22,880
 And there's been another one where they gave people two glasses of wine,

720
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,880
 one was white, one was red,

721
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,880
 and then they said, "What do you think?"

722
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,880
 And they liked the red one.

723
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,880
 "Oh, yeah, there's hints of berries and there's hints of jamminess

724
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,880
 and all this kind of stuff."

725
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,880
 But actually, it was white wine with red food colouring in it,

726
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,880
 and they couldn't tell the difference between the two.

727
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,880
 When the temperature was the same, they couldn't tell the difference.

728
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,880
 So, whole things a sham.

729
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,880
 I wouldn't say the whole things a sham, but I think a lot of it is.

730
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,880
 Wow.

731
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,880
 Okay.

732
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,880
 I'm going to buy that two euro wine bottle I saw earlier there.

733
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,880
 Well, that's what all other drinks is, isn't it?

734
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,880
 Exactly. This is why I stick to the hawk.

735
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,880
 And you'll be fine.

736
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,880
 Do you know what the fastest growing wine in the history of America's wine industry is?

737
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,880
 The fastest growing wine?

738
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,880
 Yeah.

739
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,880
 You mean physically the grapes?

740
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,880
 No, sorry.

741
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:06,880
 I mean, as in they sold not many, and then loads, and then loads, and then even more.

742
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,880
 Have we heard of it?

743
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,880
 Is it...?

744
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,880
 Possibly not.

745
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,880
 Oh, well, this is a shit, please.

746
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,880
 Is it a famous kind of wine?

747
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,880
 It's famous in America.

748
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,880
 It's called Two Buck Chuck.

749
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,880
 Oh, that sounds lovely.

750
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,880
 And it is white wine that costs $199 in dollars per bottle.

751
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:28,880
 Actually, now due to the cost of living, it is $3.49 per bottle.

752
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:35,880
 But for many, many years, it was started in 2002, and for probably about 15 years, they kept it under $2.

753
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:40,880
 And the way they did it is they just took all their off the bits that's left from all the different wine growers,

754
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,880
 and then they brought it to this factory and mixed it all together and sold it for cheap.

755
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:51,880
 But the thing was, their factory was in the Napa Valley, so they could put Napa Valley on all of the labels.

756
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:56,880
 I still don't think however cheap I'd buy a wine that had a synonym for vomit in its name.

757
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,880
 I think we'd work on the title.

758
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:08,880
 The first ever vineyard planted in California was in 1769, and it was by a man who used to whip himself with spikes.

759
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,880
 Okay.

760
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:15,880
 This was because wines were often grown, as you know in Belgium similarly with beer, by weird religious people.

761
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,880
 And he was one of them.

762
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:27,880
 And this was in San Diego, and he was a guy called Father Junipero Serra, which is weird because his name is Juniper, which is gin.

763
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,880
 And Serra is a kind of wine.

764
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,880
 Serra is a kind of wine.

765
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,880
 I mean, he's all over the place.

766
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:41,880
 And yeah, he was a Franciscan monk, and he planted the very first Californian vines, and they were the main ones growing for about 100 years.

767
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:48,880
 But he also used to wear sackcloths with lots of spikes on the inside that jammed into him as he walked.

768
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,880
 You know what? The first monk to turn that inside out were the spikes on the outside.

769
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,880
 That was punk. That was punk.

770
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,880
 Like, it rhymes with monk, it's punk.

771
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:03,880
 And the Monarch for whether you're talking to a monk or a punk.

772
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:16,880
 All right, we do need to get to our final fact of the show. It is time for our final fact of the show, and that is James.

773
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:22,880
 Okay, my fact this week is that some donkeys keep sheep in their pockets.

774
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,880
 Now.

775
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,880
 There we are.

776
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,880
 There's a picture on the screen.

777
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,880
 Anna, why don't you describe what you're looking at?

778
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:36,880
 What I'm seeing is a donkey with pockets, wearing a coat with pockets to be fair, and some really cute lambs poking out of them.

779
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,880
 Why are they doing that?

780
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:47,880
 Well, they are being taken to high pastures to the top of mountains where they can feed, and it's very difficult to transport newborn lambs.

781
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:53,880
 Because you can't really, you can't put them on a car because the roads aren't so good, like a four by four, I guess, or something like that.

782
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:57,880
 But actually the donkeys are really good at getting up the mountains.

783
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,880
 And so you want to put your sheep with your donkeys.

784
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,880
 And a donkey realistically is quite difficult for a donkey to carry a sheep.

785
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:10,880
 So it needs to have some kind of outfit where you've got little pockets where you can put the sheep in.

786
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,880
 It is adorable.

787
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,880
 And this happens in Lombardy, a good wine region.

788
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,880
 Right.

789
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,880
 Apparently not, not anymore.

790
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:24,880
 And they have these little, they can stick their heads out so they can see where they're going because they think very sweet.

791
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,880
 They might get travel sick or something otherwise.

792
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,880
 Yeah, so nice.

793
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,880
 Donkeys have a lot of different uses.

794
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,880
 Oh, yeah.

795
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,880
 You can name an activity and a donkey can help.

796
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,880
 Golf.

797
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,880
 Golf.

798
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,880
 Yeah.

799
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,880
 Oh, yeah.

800
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,880
 Caddy.

801
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,880
 The donkey caddy.

802
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,880
 Okay.

803
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,880
 I picked, I actually picked quite an easy one.

804
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,880
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

805
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,880
 Unfortunately, that's the first activity that comes into my head in all circumstances.

806
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,880
 Okay.

807
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,880
 Well, there are guard donkeys in France.

808
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,880
 There's a bit of the Atlantic coast, which is called Poitou Charotte.

809
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:04,880
 And there are guard donkeys there because France has a lot more wolves than it, well, lots of Europe has a lot more wolves than it used to.

810
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:14,880
 They've been reintroduced and they can sometimes prey on sheep, not in Poitou Charotte where the donkeys are so aggressive and so big and so frightening.

811
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,880
 And they will, they will find a wolf and run towards it and kick it in the head that the wolves just don't even try anymore.

812
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,880
 Right.

813
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,880
 Wow.

814
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,880
 These are bigger donkeys than an average donkey.

815
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,880
 They are larger than the average donkey.

816
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,880
 Yeah.

817
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,880
 Great.

818
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,880
 Because otherwise it's embarrassing.

819
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,880
 I think it's a wolf to go back to your pack and say, there was a donkey.

820
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,880
 Oh, it's embarrassing either way.

821
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,880
 Yeah.

822
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,880
 Well, a donkey.

823
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,880
 He's massive.

824
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,880
 He's massive.

825
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,880
 It's more like a horse.

826
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,880
 Yeah.

827
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,880
 So there's a story about the donkeys.

828
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,880
 Beehives used to be transported by donkeys.

829
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:48,880
 So they would put wooden hives on the side of them and they would, I guess, walk very carefully towards where they were going.

830
00:36:48,880 --> 00:37:01,880
 There's a story which kind of has like bled into legend, but I will continue to talk despite being a factual podcast where supposedly the relics of saints, if they were transporting them, a donkey would transport it.

831
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:05,880
 Because donkeys obviously very tied in to religious iconography.

832
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,880
 Right.

833
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,880
 Jesus, you know, there was a donkey in the manger.

834
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,880
 According to the main story and so on.

835
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,880
 And so Jesus rode on a donkey on paths and days.

836
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,880
 Yeah.

837
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,880
 So it's very much that.

838
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,880
 So the idea was that if you were taking.

839
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,880
 Sorry.

840
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,880
 Can I just say I don't think the donkey was in the manger so much as beside it looking at.

841
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,880
 I think Jesus was on his own in the manger.

842
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,880
 What is the manger?

843
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,880
 It's the crib, isn't it?

844
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,880
 Yeah.

845
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,880
 I thought the crib was the crib and the manger was the room.

846
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,880
 God, he would have stuffed all those farm animals straight into the crib.

847
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,880
 Well, that's why my nativity play was received very badly at school.

848
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,880
 And it was controversial.

849
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:46,880
 There is a song actually of a Christmas, which is Little Donkey, which is about how their Jesus, Mary and Joseph are going to Bethlehem.

850
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,880
 And Mary sits on the donkey and goes along.

851
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,880
 Okay.

852
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,880
 And Jesus is going inside Mary's tummy at that point.

853
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,880
 Yes, absolutely.

854
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,880
 Yes.

855
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,880
 But actually women did not ride donkeys in those days in the Holy Land.

856
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,880
 Really?

857
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,880
 Only men would ride donkeys.

858
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,880
 So the man would have been on while the woman, even though she was pregnant, would have been walking behind.

859
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,880
 No.

860
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,880
 Generally speaking.

861
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,880
 Wow.

862
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,880
 Wow.

863
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,880
 That is the one problem.

864
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,880
 Not really.

865
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,880
 If you're Joseph, you're going, I don't even know whose baby this is anyway.

866
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,880
 How does this happen, love?

867
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,880
 Keep walking.

868
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,880
 Yeah.

869
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:27,880
 And actually, if you look at a donkey from above today, most donkeys, they've got like,

870
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:32,880
 they've got some hair that goes across their shoulders and then they've got a line of hair that goes across their back.

871
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,880
 And it looks like a cross.

872
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,880
 That's another reason why it's quite religious.

873
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,880
 Sign of the cross.

874
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,880
 That's great.

875
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,880
 Is that why it's called the mange?

876
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,880
 What?

877
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,880
 Is that what it's called?

878
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,880
 It's called the mane.

879
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,880
 It's not called the mange.

880
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,880
 Unless you've got a mangy donkey.

881
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,880
 Wait, wait.

882
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,880
 Aren't we away in a manger here?

883
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,880
 Are we trying to say there's no link?

884
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:53,880
 Are we trying to say Dan's just misheard something and not understood it?

885
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,880
 Yes, we are.

886
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,880
 Carry on.

887
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,880
 I wish I graduated.

888
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:03,880
 In Britain, one of our main hobbies is preserving the lives of elderly donkeys.

889
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,880
 It's a big thing.

890
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,880
 It's a big, like, lots of big donkey charities in the UK.

891
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,880
 Do you have big donkey charities here?

892
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,880
 Like, basically, if you watch TV in the middle of the day, then there'll be an advertisement saying,

893
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,880
 "Please leave all your money to a donkey sanctuary when you die."

894
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,880
 And people do in their thousands.

895
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,880
 They leave all their money to the donkeys.

896
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:29,880
 So you guys, who do old sad people leave their money to when they die if not to donkey sanctuaries?

897
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:34,880
 I literally don't understand where all that money would go if you didn't have donkey sanctuaries as an option.

898
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,880
 It's what happens to all of it.

899
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,880
 You guys are weird.

900
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:46,880
 I went to the donkey sanctuary barmouth website and I had some just great donkey facts that I have not checked.

901
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:52,880
 But fact number two, donkeys can see all four feet at the same time.

902
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,880
 I have checked that and it's not true.

903
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,880
 Have you?

904
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,880
 Yeah, I have.

905
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,880
 Also, why did you start with fact number two?

906
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,880
 Fact number one was even more boring than that one, if you can imagine that.

907
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,880
 We don't have to stick to the sanctuary's numbering system.

908
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,880
 Fact number 12.

909
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:13,880
 This is when I realised this list of donkey facts was suspicious.

910
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:20,880
 A donkey's prey will carry up to 60 miles in the desert.

911
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,880
 I just don't think that can be true.

912
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,880
 It doesn't seem very likely, does it?

913
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,880
 60 miles!

914
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,880
 Is that donkey to donkey though or to human?

915
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,880
 Is it like, you know how dogs can hear a different, higher sound?

916
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,880
 You'd think that it would not be audible to predator animals.

917
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,880
 Like, there's a donkey 57 miles that way.

918
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:47,880
 Just a little announcement that might have got passed a lot of people.

919
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:51,880
 Sadly, we lost one of the great donkeys this year, this January.

920
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,880
 No.

921
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,880
 Yeah, Perry.

922
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,880
 Perry the donkey has passed away age 30.

923
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,880
 Perry was the inspiration for donkey from Shrek.

924
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,880
 That was a real donkey.

925
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,880
 And when you see a photo, it looks exactly like donkey from Shrek.

926
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,880
 It's a donkey, yeah, he's a donkey.

927
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,880
 But his big, big old face, nose, tiny.

928
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,880
 It's a donkey.

929
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:17,880
 Yeah, Perry was originally sent to California to help calm polo ponies.

930
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,880
 So he would be calm them down and keep them chilled.

931
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,880
 But things went bad when he bit every single one of them.

932
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,880
 Which is so Shrek donkey, right?

933
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,880
 Also, good on him.

934
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,880
 You pretentious dickheads playing polo.

935
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,880
 That's what I do to polo players.

936
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,880
 Wow.

937
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:39,880
 Do you know what the biggest global threat to donkey welfare is at the moment?

938
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,880
 Big horse.

939
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,880
 Just one big horse?

940
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,880
 The horse industry.

941
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,880
 The horse industry.

942
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,880
 They're competing.

943
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,880
 People aren't breeding donkeys anymore.

944
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,880
 People banning, riding on them at the seaside.

945
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,880
 Is it like the overweight children on Blackpool Beach trying to ride donkeys?

946
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,880
 Because I know they have caused a problem.

947
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,880
 They have banned them.

948
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,880
 It is not that.

949
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:05,880
 It is China consume something called Ejio, which is a gelatin you make from donkey's skin.

950
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,880
 And it's supposed to be good for you due to Chinese medicine in various different ways.

951
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,880
 In China, there were lots of donkeys there.

952
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,880
 People are using them to move things around.

953
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,880
 And so actually they have quite a lot of donkeys there.

954
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,880
 But more recently, when China has become more industrialized,

955
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,880
 people don't have donkeys anymore.

956
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,880
 So they have to get their donkey skin from other countries.

957
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:27,880
 And they're importing loads and loads of donkey skins, especially from Africa.

958
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:34,880
 And the number of donkeys in Botswana fell by 60% in the five years between 2011 and 2016.

959
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,880
 Yikes.

960
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,880
 Fifth in Lesotho.

961
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,880
 And the price of donkey skins is going through the roof at the moment.

962
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,880
 If you had a thousand pounds at the start of 2017,

963
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:46,880
 and you invested it in donkey skins for the first six months,

964
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,880
 and Bitcoin for the second six months,

965
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,880
 you would have ended up with £25,000,

966
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:56,880
 which would have been enough to buy a pair of cufflinks owned by Elvis.

967
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,880
 Again, you always guilt the lily train.

968
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,880
 There was a sale that year of Elvis.

969
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,880
 Wait, sorry, is that £1,000 to £25?

970
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:07,880
 Yeah.

971
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:11,880
 And you simply needed to be an expert in the field both of donkey skin and Bitcoin.

972
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,880
 Yeah.

973
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,880
 And get the time in exactly right.

974
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,880
 Of course.

975
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,880
 Laura of Everett did someone well have done that.

976
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:18,880
 Yeah.

977
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,880
 I think donkey meat is quite a delicacy in China,

978
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:29,880
 although the Chinese branch of Walmart had to recall a bunch of five-spice donkey meat products in 2014.

979
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,880
 But that was because they tested them and they were full of Fox DNA,

980
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,880
 which is not a delicacy.

981
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,880
 So what, the donkeys have been eating foxes?

982
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,880
 No, I don't think we're blaming the donkeys for contaminating the donkeys.

983
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,880
 We had the thing in the UK where beef products, like beef lasagna,

984
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,880
 turned out to be containing horse and donkey as well.

985
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:51,880
 Oh, was it?

986
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,880
 And so donkey meat then containing Fox.

987
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,880
 So what's in my Fox Burgers?

988
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:56,880
 That's what I want to know.

989
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,880
 It's the old woman who swallowed the fly, but the other way.

990
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,880
 Guys, I need to wrap us up in a saying.

991
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,880
 Do you have Lyme disease here?

992
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:06,880
 What do you call it, that?

993
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,880
 Okay, so really dangerous, obviously.

994
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:09,880
 You get it from a tick.

995
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:13,880
 You get bitten by a tick and it creates really bad for you Lyme disease.

996
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:19,880
 Anyway, so little bloodsuckers, donkeys and horses secrete this natural compound,

997
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,880
 which ticks can't cope with.

998
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:23,880
 They hate it.

999
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:27,880
 So if you wrap yourself in a live donkey, you will be safe.

1000
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:28,880
 A live donkey?

1001
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,880
 I think it has to be a living donkey.

1002
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:31,880
 Yeah, yeah.

1003
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:35,880
 How long is it going to be alive when you've wrapped it around yourself?

1004
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:39,880
 You are going to need a fresh donkey after a little while, I think.

1005
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:40,880
 Wow.

1006
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,880
 Anyway, just a tip for you there.

1007
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,880
 And if you do die from Lyme disease,

1008
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:52,880
 consider donating all of your money to a donkey sanctuary, people of Belgium.

1009
00:44:52,880 --> 00:45:00,880
 That is it.

1010
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:01,880
 That is all of our facts.

1011
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:04,880
 Thank you all of you for coming and sitting here and listening to us here

1012
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,880
 at the Nerdland Festival.

1013
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,880
 If you want to get in contact with any of us,

1014
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:09,880
 we're all on social media.

1015
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:12,880
 I'm on @Tribaland on Instagram, Andy.

1016
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,880
 @AndrewHunterM, various.

1017
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,880
 James.

1018
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:21,880
 No such thing as James Huck and equally various.

1019
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,880
 Okay, and Anna, to get to us as a group.

1020
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,880
 You can email podcast@qi.com and that's just on email.

1021
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,880
 And then on Instagram, where I know such thing as a fish.

1022
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:33,880
 And on Twitter, I know such thing.

1023
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,880
 Yeah, and obviously we have a website.

1024
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,880
 No such thing as a fish.com.

1025
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:40,880
 If you want to check out all our previous episodes, go hang out there.

1026
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,880

 We've really loved it.

 Until then, goodbye.
