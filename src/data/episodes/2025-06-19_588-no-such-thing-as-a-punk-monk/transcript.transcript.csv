00:00:12,00:00:18,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:18,00:00:24,a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from the Nerdland Festival in Belgium!
00:00:24,00:00:32,[Cheering]
00:00:32,00:00:40,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin,"
00:00:40,00:00:45,"and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:00:45,00:00:49,"and in no particular order, here we go!"
00:00:49,00:00:53,"Starting with fact number one, and that is my fact,"
00:00:53,00:00:58,my fact this week is that there are more scientific papers on dung beetles
00:00:58,00:01:04,than there are on preventing the extinction of mankind.
00:01:04,00:01:05,Wow!
00:01:05,00:01:06,"Yeah, so..."
00:01:06,00:01:11,"I've got a little spider just walking on the side of the table here, look at that, oh he's on my finger!"
00:01:11,00:01:11,Very nice.
00:01:11,00:01:15,All I'm saying is it's not weird to be interested in insects.
00:01:15,00:01:15,Yes.
00:01:15,00:01:19,"That spider's come for this fact, absolutely loving it."
00:01:19,00:01:21,"No, this is a brilliant new book coming out, it's coming out in July,"
00:01:21,00:01:24,"it's called The Anti-Catastrophe League by Tom Off,"
00:01:24,00:01:31,and it's basically a look into all the people globally who are trying to stop us from going extinct.
00:01:31,00:01:33,How do we survive a super volcano?
00:01:33,00:01:35,How do we survive asteroid attacks?
00:01:35,00:01:38,How do we survive AI if it gets too intelligent?
00:01:38,00:01:43,"He goes around the world and he meets all the people who are dedicating their lives to doing it,"
00:01:43,00:01:45,"and as one of the little nuggets in there,"
00:01:45,00:01:48,"he brings up a little fact by a guy called Nick Bostrom,"
00:01:48,00:01:54,"who's quite a famous scientist and is a big player in this kind of existential risk thing,"
00:01:54,00:01:58,"where he says, yeah, basically if you look into the literature,"
00:01:58,00:02:03,there's more on dung beetles in scientific literature than there is on surviving.
00:02:03,00:02:06,Is there anything on how dung beetles might cause us to go extinct?
00:02:06,00:02:08,"Oh, good question."
00:02:08,00:02:10,Or help us avoid it!
00:02:10,00:02:13,That's not immediately make them the villains of the piece.
00:02:13,00:02:16,"If the dung beetles went on strike, then..."
00:02:16,00:02:19,"- Yeah, we'd be up to our necks and... - Exactly."
00:02:19,00:02:23,"- We'd be in the shit, literally. - Yeah."
00:02:23,00:02:27,- So we need to kill all dung beetles? - No.
00:02:27,00:02:31,"- Okay, that's what it sounded like. - So how is the world going to end according to your mate?"
00:02:31,00:02:33,"I mean, there are so many different ways."
00:02:33,00:02:38,"I should just say, just for context, in 2018, there was a Google scholar search"
00:02:38,00:02:42,"which showed 1,830 results for dung beetle-based papers,"
00:02:42,00:02:49,as opposed to 449 for human extinction and 940 for terms like existential risk and so on.
00:02:49,00:02:53,It's more a metaphor for the fact that we're focusing more on things like insects
00:02:53,00:02:55,than we are on these bigger problems.
00:02:55,00:02:58,"Well, that's because dung beetles exist, so they're easy to study."
00:02:58,00:03:00,"- The end of the world doesn't exist. - Yes, that's largely..."
00:03:00,00:03:02,"And as far as we're concerned, it never will."
00:03:02,00:03:05,"Well, the end of humanity, sorry, not the end of the world."
00:03:05,00:03:06,It really pisses me off when humans do this.
00:03:06,00:03:09,The world doesn't give a shit if we go extinct.
00:03:09,00:03:11,The world's just going to keep on turning.
00:03:11,00:03:13,And I think quite a lot of the people who look into it are talking about things
00:03:13,00:03:17,"that are so unlikely, aren't they, that you think like there was that..."
00:03:17,00:03:21,"- What kind of stuff, yeah. - So, there was an open letter"
00:03:21,00:03:24,"written by a bunch of scientists recently, I think 38 of the world's leading scientists,"
00:03:24,00:03:28,"Nobel Prize winners and the like, wrote an open letter with a warning,"
00:03:28,00:03:31,"""Stop trying to create the mirror image of life on Earth,"
00:03:31,00:03:33,"because it will wipe us all out."""
00:03:33,00:03:37,"So, very dumb-down version, all proteins made of amino acids"
00:03:37,00:03:41,"which are left-handed, which is just all about the way they spin,"
00:03:41,00:03:45,we don't really know why all life is built out of these left-handed amino acids.
00:03:45,00:03:50,"But scientists can now synthesise in labs right-handed amino acids,"
00:03:50,00:03:54,"and that could be super useful for lots of things that can make better drugs,"
00:03:54,00:03:57,"so it could really, like, it could defeat a lot of sort of natural biological things,"
00:03:57,00:04:00,"but it could also wipe us all out,"
00:04:00,00:04:05,"because basically, if you get a right-handed bacteria that we've created in a lab,"
00:04:05,00:04:06,nothing has evolved to beat it.
00:04:06,00:04:10,A right-handed bacteria attacks our bodies and our bodies don't even recognise it.
00:04:10,00:04:14,- They don't even see it. It's invisible. - It's like a left-handed cricketer.
00:04:14,00:04:15,- Or a tennis player. - It's Nadal.
00:04:15,00:04:19,"- Are they invisible? - They're unbeatable, yeah."
00:04:19,00:04:21,Unbeatable. There you go. You can't play them.
00:04:21,00:04:25,"Another thing that's similar to that is a thing called strange matter,"
00:04:25,00:04:30,"and this is if you get nuclear stuff and you squash it down, squash it down, squash it down,"
00:04:30,00:04:32,"it can turn into this thing called strange matter,"
00:04:32,00:04:37,"and if it comes and touches normal matter, then they can annihilate each other,"
00:04:37,00:04:42,and that thing that might happen is known as a strange conversation.
00:04:42,00:04:45,"And apparently, if you get a strange conversation happening anywhere in the universe,"
00:04:45,00:04:47,that could be the end of everything.
00:04:47,00:04:51,"It feels like we should be annihilating each other all the time, what are you saying?"
00:04:51,00:04:52,That's so funny.
00:04:52,00:04:55,"So there are big groups that are trying to work out how to save us all,"
00:04:55,00:05:00,"and in 2005, this guy mentioned Nick Bostrom, who's a big best-selling author,"
00:05:00,00:05:04,"he's a big name in science, he founded the Future of Humanity Institute,"
00:05:04,00:05:08,"and when they look at these bigger problems, how are we going to survive as a species?"
00:05:08,00:05:13,"So it was him, there's another guy who joined, called Anders Sandberg,"
00:05:13,00:05:15,"very interesting character, Swedish scientist,"
00:05:15,00:05:19,"he developed a bunch of ideas that he's been putting forward in the science world,"
00:05:19,00:05:23,"but my favorite thing is he wrote a paper that asked the question,"
00:05:23,00:05:26,"""What if the entire Earth was instantaneously replaced"
00:05:26,00:05:32,"with an equal volume of closely packed but uncompressed blueberries?"""
00:05:32,00:05:33,Okay.
00:05:33,00:05:36,"He picked big, thick-skinned, high-bush blueberries,"
00:05:36,00:05:37,because he thought that was best for it.
00:05:37,00:05:39,And so what's going to happen?
00:05:39,00:05:40,"It's a very hostile world, James."
00:05:40,00:05:41,"Wait, it's not good."
00:05:41,00:05:45,"Oh, I was going to guess nothing at all happens,"
00:05:45,00:05:47,"because that's the answer half the time, because it would..."
00:05:47,00:05:49,Small blueberry farmers go out of business quite quickly.
00:05:49,00:05:51,"That's true, that's true."
00:05:51,00:05:53,"No, he said if you were standing on blueberries,"
00:05:53,00:05:56,"it might be possible, in theory, that we could survive."
00:05:56,00:05:59,"However, almost immediately, they would begin to compress rapidly,"
00:05:59,00:06:02,"and then air would start erupting everywhere,"
00:06:02,00:06:03,"causing great earthquakes,"
00:06:03,00:06:06,and then the entire environment would be completely filled
00:06:06,00:06:09,"by boiling jam and steam,"
00:06:09,00:06:12,"and we would live in just a big, crazy jam world."
00:06:12,00:06:16,"But is this... Sorry, has he got funding to find out that this is a bad idea?"
00:06:16,00:06:19,"Yeah, and you're saying there should be more papers like this?"
00:06:19,00:06:22,I'm saying this is the co-founder of an institution
00:06:22,00:06:24,that's looking to work out how we survive into infinity.
00:06:24,00:06:27,"Okay, so he was the co-founder with Nick Bostrom."
00:06:27,00:06:28,"Yeah, Bostrom, yeah."
00:06:28,00:06:32,So one of Nick Bostrom's idea is the paperclip maximiser.
00:06:32,00:06:33,"Oh, yeah."
00:06:33,00:06:36,"And that is that you come up with an AI, and you say to that AI,"
00:06:36,00:06:38,"""What we need is paperclips."""
00:06:38,00:06:41,"But you don't give it any other instructions, you say to it,"
00:06:41,00:06:44,"""Whatever you do, make as many paperclips as you can."""
00:06:44,00:06:46,"And if you do that, they'll quickly realise"
00:06:46,00:06:48,"that if they make too many paperclips,"
00:06:48,00:06:50,"then the humans might come and turn the machine off,"
00:06:50,00:06:53,"so they immediately decide to kill all the humans,"
00:06:53,00:06:54,because they don't want to get turned off.
00:06:54,00:06:57,And then they also realise that humans are made out of carbon
00:06:57,00:06:59,and lots of different metals and stuff.
00:06:59,00:07:02,"And actually, we're quite good paperclip material."
00:07:02,00:07:06,"And so what you end up is the world with no humans,"
00:07:06,00:07:08,but a ton of paperclips.
00:07:08,00:07:11,Pick up your paperclips with this little eye looking back like that.
00:07:11,00:07:15,It looks like you're trying to end the world.
00:07:15,00:07:16,Very nice.
00:07:16,00:07:17,It's beautiful.
00:07:17,00:07:18,"And the idea is that it would then go,"
00:07:18,00:07:21,"""Well, we should make everything in the universe paperclips."""
00:07:21,00:07:24,And it would take over planets and set up paperclip factories
00:07:24,00:07:27,and make more until all of existence was one big paperclip.
00:07:27,00:07:31,"Actually, I wrote to Nick Bostrom, the scientist, a few years ago,"
00:07:31,00:07:33,because I was researching something about the end of the world
00:07:33,00:07:35,and I wanted his opinion of it.
00:07:35,00:07:37,And he just sent me a rather nice line.
00:07:37,00:07:38,I think you might like this.
00:07:38,00:07:40,"He said, ""Some of our biggest problems"
00:07:40,00:07:42,"are primarily political and ethical,"
00:07:42,00:07:44,and they'll need solutions in those realms.
00:07:44,00:07:50,"For a great future, we really need both capability and love."
00:07:50,00:07:54,"But if we could only have one, I'd pick love,"
00:07:54,00:07:57,"and I would pick capability, personally."""
00:07:57,00:07:59,"I think he's going to be disappointed from that,"
00:07:59,00:08:02,because I think he was flirting with you.
00:08:02,00:08:04,"Oh, no!"
00:08:04,00:08:06,"That was effectively a swipe last day, Andy."
00:08:06,00:08:08,"You know, the good news about the end of the world,"
00:08:08,00:08:10,"if you think about it, is..."
00:08:10,00:08:12,"So, what's one of the ideas for defeating it?"
00:08:12,00:08:16,"Well, there's a guy you might not have heard of called Elon Musk,"
00:08:16,00:08:18,who talks a lot about terraforming Mars
00:08:18,00:08:21,as being a way that humans could escape and go to another place.
00:08:21,00:08:23,"What's the main problem with Mars,"
00:08:23,00:08:26,"the thing we need to do to it, to make it liveable?"
00:08:26,00:08:27,"Like, everything."
00:08:27,00:08:30,We need to stop all the radiation.
00:08:30,00:08:30,"Loads of stuff, yeah."
00:08:30,00:08:31,Get rid of the aliens.
00:08:31,00:08:32,OK.
00:08:32,00:08:34,(LAUGHTER)
00:08:34,00:08:36,"Loads of stuff, not including that."
00:08:36,00:08:38,"But one of the big things is make it warmer,"
00:08:38,00:08:41,and we already know how to warm a planet.
00:08:41,00:08:43,"Oh! Oh, terrific!"
00:08:43,00:08:46,"So, and as Elon Musk has planned,"
00:08:46,00:08:51,he has a plan to drop hydrogen bombs into the atmosphere above Mars
00:08:51,00:08:54,"every few seconds, and that will release the carbon dioxide"
00:08:54,00:08:56,trapped in Mars' ice caps.
00:08:56,00:08:58,Would we know that carbon dioxide warmed a planet
00:08:58,00:09:00,unless we'd already experimented with this one?
00:09:00,00:09:01,No.
00:09:01,00:09:03,"So, was it all part of the game?"
00:09:03,00:09:05,"I think it might be worth sending him up there,"
00:09:05,00:09:07,maybe with his ex-best mate.
00:09:07,00:09:09,(LAUGHTER)
00:09:09,00:09:11,Wow.
00:09:11,00:09:12,Have done beetles?
00:09:12,00:09:13,"Oh, yeah. Yeah."
00:09:13,00:09:15,They don't just eat dung.
00:09:15,00:09:16,"OK, get out."
00:09:16,00:09:17,Yeah.
00:09:17,00:09:18,Some of them eat fungi.
00:09:18,00:09:20,Some of them eat rotting fruits.
00:09:20,00:09:21,Some of them eat carrion.
00:09:21,00:09:23,"I mean, none of them eat burgers."
00:09:23,00:09:25,It's all pretty disgusting stuff.
00:09:25,00:09:27,Decapitated millipedes.
00:09:27,00:09:28,I read about that one.
00:09:28,00:09:29,It's a dung beetle in Peru.
00:09:29,00:09:31,"It has given up eating poo,"
00:09:31,00:09:35,and they all have this kind of chisel shape on their head
00:09:35,00:09:37,"to shape the poo into a ball,"
00:09:37,00:09:38,which is what they normally do.
00:09:38,00:09:40,"But this one in Peru, it has given up eating poo,"
00:09:40,00:09:44,and it uses its chisel to decapitate millipedes.
00:09:44,00:09:46,"So, at what point?"
00:09:46,00:09:48,That's an evolutionary question.
00:09:48,00:09:49,It's just one dung beetle.
00:09:49,00:09:51,"He goes, ""Wait a minute."""
00:09:51,00:09:54,"This is delicious, compared with what I've been eating my whole life."
00:09:54,00:09:58,"Also, they don't eat very large pieces of poo."
00:09:58,00:09:59,(LAUGHTER)
00:09:59,00:10:00,"They're very fussy eaters,"
00:10:00,00:10:04,and they have a bad reputation as being like the slobs.
00:10:04,00:10:06,Dung beetles specifically pick out
00:10:06,00:10:10,"nitrogen-rich, tiny particles inside poo."
00:10:10,00:10:12,"So, actually, they hate the big bits of poo."
00:10:12,00:10:16,But they're picking particles two thousandths of a millimetre big.
00:10:16,00:10:18,That's not a sizeable meal.
00:10:18,00:10:20,"So, is there actually any poo in that?"
00:10:20,00:10:21,It's all poo.
00:10:21,00:10:22,It's all poo.
00:10:22,00:10:25,"No, because sometimes when I poo, there's corn in it."
00:10:25,00:10:26,"Oh, my God."
00:10:26,00:10:29,You're going to get extra materials.
00:10:29,00:10:31,It's all poo once it's part of the poo.
00:10:31,00:10:35,"I think I'm not going to dance, Rastron."
00:10:35,00:10:39,"You know, a single elephant can maintain two million dung beetles."
00:10:39,00:10:40,"Oh, nice."
00:10:40,00:10:41,That is good.
00:10:41,00:10:44,"But then if that one elephant dies, then they're all out of business."
00:10:44,00:10:45,Are they alive?
00:10:45,00:10:46,That's true.
00:10:46,00:10:47,Yes.
00:10:47,00:10:49,It's like a Trojan elephant kind of situation.
00:10:49,00:10:50,"No, they're not inside it."
00:10:50,00:10:51,"Oh, sorry."
00:10:51,00:10:52,(LAUGHTER)
00:10:52,00:10:53,What did you say?
00:10:53,00:10:54,What did you say?
00:10:54,00:10:57,(LAUGHTER)
00:10:57,00:11:00,"I said, ""Sustain, not contain."""
00:11:00,00:11:03,(LAUGHTER)
00:11:03,00:11:07,"The onphophagous taurus, the bull-headed dung beetle,"
00:11:07,00:11:10,it's kind of the poster boy for dung beetles.
00:11:10,00:11:13,"They can pull dung 1,000 times their body weight."
00:11:13,00:11:14,Wow.
00:11:14,00:11:16,Which is the equivalent of me being able to pull
00:11:16,00:11:20,an entire right whale's testicle made of poo.
00:11:20,00:11:21,Ah!
00:11:21,00:11:23,How relatable for everyone.
00:11:23,00:11:24,(LAUGHTER)
00:11:24,00:11:25,Thank you.
00:11:25,00:11:29,(MUSIC)
00:11:29,00:11:33,"It is time for fact number two, and that is Andy."
00:11:33,00:11:39,"My fact is, new Finnish doctors are officially issued with a sword."
00:11:39,00:11:43,"Short doctors get a short sword, and tall doctors get a long sword."
00:11:43,00:11:44,Oh.
00:11:44,00:11:47,"And it's if you get a doctorate of medicine or philosophy or whatever,"
00:11:47,00:11:50,"you get to wear a nice top hat, which we don't have in the UK."
00:11:50,00:11:51,"You see, because when you said this,"
00:11:51,00:11:53,I thought you meant doctors as medical doctors.
00:11:53,00:11:57,"It is medical doctors, but it's also, it's getting a doctorate."
00:11:57,00:11:59,"It's graduating, basically."
00:11:59,00:12:00,"Graduating, yes."
00:12:00,00:12:03,"So fine arts, probably business, PhDs, whatever it is."
00:12:03,00:12:06,"And if you're under a certain height, you get a 76-centimeter sword."
00:12:06,00:12:08,"If you're a bit taller, you get an 81-centimeter sword."
00:12:08,00:12:10,It's not a huge difference.
00:12:10,00:12:14,"The night before you graduate, you go to a traditional sword wetting ceremony,"
00:12:14,00:12:17,where you have to go and sharpen your own sword.
00:12:17,00:12:18,That's wet.
00:12:18,00:12:19,Wetting.
00:12:19,00:12:20,Wetting.
00:12:20,00:12:22,I think you need to wet it a little bit as part of the hotting.
00:12:22,00:12:24,So that wetting in this case means sort of grinding it down.
00:12:24,00:12:26,Sharpening it on a grindstone.
00:12:26,00:12:27,That's cool.
00:12:27,00:12:28,"And it's a whole process, right?"
00:12:28,00:12:30,"Like, you apply for it, you give your name,"
00:12:30,00:12:32,which gets etched into the side of it.
00:12:32,00:12:35,"It has the date of your graduation, I believe, there as well."
00:12:35,00:12:37,And the hat is the only difference.
00:12:37,00:12:39,That's how you tell what they're graduating from.
00:12:39,00:12:40,So they wear a hat?
00:12:40,00:12:42,They all wear top hats.
00:12:42,00:12:46,They are also bespoke hats made on the front of them.
00:12:46,00:12:50,There's a little gold emblem that shows the faculties and so on that they're connected to.
00:12:50,00:12:53,"And so if you're a doctor of fine arts, you'll get a dark blue hat."
00:12:53,00:12:55,"But if you're a doctor of law, you get crimson."
00:12:55,00:12:58,So that's how you tell the different doctorates apart.
00:12:58,00:13:02,"Apparently that idea comes back from the University of Uppsala,"
00:13:02,00:13:04,"which is in Sweden, not Finland."
00:13:04,00:13:09,And some students went to Finland from Uppsala and they were wearing purple berets.
00:13:09,00:13:12,"But they were like, ""Oh, they look really great. Let's do that."""
00:13:12,00:13:14,And Uppsala got their idea from the Romans.
00:13:14,00:13:19,"And the idea was if you were a freed slave, you would get a red hat."
00:13:19,00:13:21,It all goes back all the way to that.
00:13:21,00:13:25,"And speaking of Uppsala, by the way, at 10 p.m. every night,"
00:13:25,00:13:29,the students in Uppsala open their windows and start screaming.
00:13:29,00:13:30,And nobody knows why.
00:13:30,00:13:31,Every night?
00:13:31,00:13:32,Every night.
00:13:32,00:13:34,But someone needs to ask them.
00:13:34,00:13:37,"Well, they do it because their predecessors have done it"
00:13:37,00:13:38,and their predecessors have done it.
00:13:38,00:13:42,But the reason that the original ones did it is lost to the midst of time.
00:13:42,00:13:43,Right.
00:13:43,00:13:45,Do you know how long they've been doing it?
00:13:45,00:13:47,Since the '70s.
00:13:47,00:13:48,"Oh, okay."
00:13:48,00:13:49,Since the '70s.
00:13:49,00:13:53,"Since, okay, someone must be alive there from the '70s."
00:13:53,00:13:55,But I think a lot was happening in the '70s
00:13:55,00:13:57,that people don't really know why they were doing it.
00:13:57,00:13:58,"Yeah, right."
00:13:58,00:13:59,They're all jogged up to their eyeballs.
00:13:59,00:14:00,Got it.
00:14:00,00:14:01,They didn't know why at the time.
00:14:01,00:14:03,What did you guys do when you graduated?
00:14:03,00:14:04,I can't remember.
00:14:04,00:14:05,Nothing.
00:14:05,00:14:06,I really can't.
00:14:06,00:14:08,I've tried to remember the ceremony because I was researching this fact.
00:14:08,00:14:09,I can't remember the day.
00:14:09,00:14:10,I can't remember being there.
00:14:10,00:14:11,Really?
00:14:11,00:14:13,I have a memory of watching myself graduate from up high in the thing.
00:14:13,00:14:14,But that can't be right.
00:14:14,00:14:16,"Well, so that maybe you nearly died?"
00:14:16,00:14:18,I didn't have an out-of-body experience.
00:14:18,00:14:19,I did die.
00:14:19,00:14:20,Okay.
00:14:20,00:14:22,"No, I just can't recall it at all."
00:14:22,00:14:23,"Yeah, I just can't remember either."
00:14:23,00:14:24,Really?
00:14:24,00:14:25,Yeah.
00:14:25,00:14:26,I can't either.
00:14:26,00:14:27,You didn't graduate.
00:14:27,00:14:30,"That's true, by the way."
00:14:30,00:14:32,I just think it's not as big a thing.
00:14:32,00:14:34,"I mean, I didn't go to mine as big a thing here."
00:14:34,00:14:37,It's somewhere like America where it's obviously this huge deal.
00:14:37,00:14:43,And I like in America the massive fanfare over who's going to do the commencement speech.
00:14:43,00:14:47,And there's always this struggle between all American universities to get big celebs.
00:14:47,00:14:52,"It seems so random, like Taylor Swift, JK Rowling, Bill Cosby, Robert De Niro."
00:14:52,00:14:55,They're all very proud of their choices.
00:14:55,00:14:56,Taylor Swift.
00:14:56,00:14:58,"I know, I know."
00:14:58,00:15:01,"A morally questionable choice, I agree."
00:15:01,00:15:02,Fly me.
00:15:02,00:15:04,"Adam, didn't you study at Edinburgh?"
00:15:04,00:15:09,I think you missed a massive opportunity when you didn't go to your graduation ceremony.
00:15:09,00:15:10,Did I?
00:15:10,00:15:15,Everyone who graduates from Edinburgh gets tapped on the head with a hat that is made
00:15:15,00:15:19,from the seat of the trousers of John Knox.
00:15:19,00:15:22,"Now, John Knox is not famous in the UK either."
00:15:22,00:15:25,But he is important.
00:15:25,00:15:28,He was the founder of the Presbyterian Church.
00:15:28,00:15:31,He was a huge figure in Scottish history and Scotland's story.
00:15:31,00:15:36,"So when he died, a pair of his breeches were turned into the Geneva Bonnet."
00:15:36,00:15:43,And now hundreds of thousands of students have been gently bonked on the head with a hat that's made of his trousers.
00:15:43,00:15:45,And you missed the chance.
00:15:45,00:15:49,"Except about 10 years ago, they decided to do some restoration on the hat."
00:15:49,00:15:55,"And they found a note inside saying Henry Banks, 22 Duke Street, 1849."
00:15:55,00:15:58,So he was supposed to have been around in the 16th century.
00:15:58,00:15:59,Yeah.
00:15:59,00:16:02,So it's at least 300 years younger than they claim it to be.
00:16:02,00:16:03,Right.
00:16:03,00:16:04,Yes.
00:16:04,00:16:05,Yes.
00:16:05,00:16:06,That's true.
00:16:06,00:16:07,But it has been to space.
00:16:07,00:16:08,It's been to space.
00:16:08,00:16:09,"Oh, well."
00:16:09,00:16:10,"Well, it hasn't been."
00:16:10,00:16:12,Let me knock down your fact.
00:16:12,00:16:15,"It's that they tried to take it to space, didn't they?"
00:16:15,00:16:19,"And the university said, no, you can't take these 100 year old trousers,"
00:16:19,00:16:21,which we're pretending are 500 years old into space.
00:16:21,00:16:25,So they instead took a piece of cloth to space and then sewed it in when they got back.
00:16:25,00:16:29,Nothing about this is making me regret not attending my graduation.
00:16:29,00:16:32,"The graduation related person, the biggest fan of his, Chuck Schumer."
00:16:32,00:16:34,Are you familiar with Chuck Schumer's work in graduations?
00:16:34,00:16:35,No.
00:16:35,00:16:37,"So Chuck Schumer, I mean, why he's a little bit like John Knox."
00:16:37,00:16:39,"You're like, Chuck Schumer, who is that?"
00:16:39,00:16:44,"He's a Senate majority leader or was until very recently, a Democrat."
00:16:44,00:16:47,"And he's one of the people who does commencement speeches, one of the celebs."
00:16:47,00:16:50,But apparently he's just does them all.
00:16:50,00:16:52,"So he's in New York, he's entering New York."
00:16:52,00:16:55,"And if you've been to uni or primary school or secondary school,"
00:16:55,00:16:59,"got a doctorate and undergrad and masters, he's rocked up."
00:16:59,00:17:02,Some people think sometimes uninvited just does the commencement speech.
00:17:02,00:17:06,"And there are Reddit threads of people going, I've been educated in New York."
00:17:06,00:17:09,I've seen that sudden speech five times.
00:17:09,00:17:11,It's always exactly the same.
00:17:11,00:17:14,"And apparently if you're sitting in the audience doing a PhD and you've gone through all education,"
00:17:14,00:17:17,you could literally just mow the long the speech with Chuck Schumer.
00:17:17,00:17:18,Wow.
00:17:18,00:17:19,As he says it over and over again.
00:17:19,00:17:20,Wow.
00:17:20,00:17:21,It's really cool.
00:17:21,00:17:24,I have a favorite graduation person from America as well.
00:17:24,00:17:25,Everyone does.
00:17:25,00:17:26,Everyone has one.
00:17:26,00:17:28,Benjamin B. Bulger.
00:17:28,00:17:31,"Benjamin B. Bulger, he's in his fifties now."
00:17:31,00:17:34,He has graduated 17 times.
00:17:34,00:17:37,Or at least he will have got his 17th very soon.
00:17:37,00:17:40,And these are not from sort of like online places.
00:17:40,00:17:45,"He graduated from Harvard, from Brown, from Stanford, Cambridge, Oxford."
00:17:45,00:17:48,I don't know if he's officially attended all 17 graduations.
00:17:48,00:17:49,He's actually getting degrees.
00:17:49,00:17:50,Yeah.
00:17:50,00:17:53,What makes me think is getting a degree is not a good pathway to getting a job.
00:17:53,00:17:54,Yeah.
00:17:54,00:17:55,If he still hasn't managed to find one.
00:17:55,00:17:57,But he seems at a basic character.
00:17:57,00:18:00,He got expelled from preschool.
00:18:00,00:18:03,He went to a school called Noah's Ark.
00:18:03,00:18:09,And he got expelled because he kept asking too many difficult questions about the animals on the Ark.
00:18:09,00:18:12,"So he said, well, what are the lions?"
00:18:12,00:18:13,Wouldn't they get hungry?
00:18:13,00:18:14,What's going to happen then?
00:18:14,00:18:15,They're going to eat everything.
00:18:15,00:18:17,"And they just went, listen, you're out of here in preschool."
00:18:17,00:18:18,Wow.
00:18:18,00:18:19,Yeah.
00:18:19,00:18:20,So he loves studying.
00:18:20,00:18:22,He homeschools his kids.
00:18:22,00:18:24,So he's called Benjamin B. Bulger.
00:18:24,00:18:27,"He has a son called Benjamin B. Bulger, junior."
00:18:27,00:18:29,And a daughter called Benjamina.
00:18:29,00:18:31,"Oh, lovely name."
00:18:31,00:18:32,Yeah.
00:18:32,00:18:35,"We got an audience fact sent in about this recently, actually."
00:18:35,00:18:36,I really like this.
00:18:36,00:18:37,This is from someone.
00:18:37,00:18:39,This is from Neil from Shrewsbury.
00:18:39,00:18:40,"So thank you, Neil."
00:18:40,00:18:41,Right.
00:18:41,00:18:42,I love this.
00:18:42,00:18:55,"For 500 years, if you wanted to get a Master of Arts degree from Oxford University, you had to swear an oath that you would never be reconciled with Henry Simeonis."
00:18:55,00:18:59,Nobody knows or knew at the time who Henry Simeonis was.
00:18:59,00:19:03,"But you had to swear, swear on your life, you would never make up with him, never settle the argument."
00:19:03,00:19:08,The oath was abolished in 1827 because nobody knew what they were abolishing.
00:19:08,00:19:09,And do we know now?
00:19:09,00:19:10,We do know now.
00:19:10,00:19:12,He killed someone.
00:19:12,00:19:13,He killed someone.
00:19:13,00:19:18,"But in like 12 something, I mean, he killed someone 600 years before."
00:19:18,00:19:19,It's been a long time.
00:19:19,00:19:20,It's been a long time.
00:19:20,00:19:22,"And he was, he was let back in."
00:19:22,00:19:27,"They started debating it 170 years before they decided, yes, let's remove this."
00:19:27,00:19:30,"We don't, like even 170 years before they thought we don't need this anymore."
00:19:30,00:19:31,Wow.
00:19:31,00:19:32,But it took them that long to get rid of it.
00:19:32,00:19:33,I just love that.
00:19:33,00:19:34,Amazing.
00:19:34,00:19:35,That's very good.
00:19:35,00:19:44,"In 2018, Norway police said to graduates that they should refrain from running naked across bridges or having sex on roundabouts."
00:19:44,00:19:47,"Which was weird because none of them had ever done it, right?"
00:19:47,00:19:50,"Apparently, this is the thing in Norway called the Russ."
00:19:50,00:19:55,"And it's basically when you graduate, you just have a big old party."
00:19:55,00:19:56,Wow.
00:19:56,00:20:04,"And you might sort of get in a bus, a Russ bus and drive around Norway and like go on a big old pub crawl along the whole country."
00:20:04,00:20:05,Cos Mayhem.
00:20:05,00:20:06,Yeah.
00:20:06,00:20:07,Just like a vengar bus.
00:20:07,00:20:15,And they came up with a new law about two or three years ago that says every group of the students has to have at least one person who isn't graduating.
00:20:15,00:20:17,Who's like the designated driver.
00:20:17,00:20:18,Official law.
00:20:18,00:20:19,That's very clever.
00:20:19,00:20:21,And they have this thing called Russ knots.
00:20:21,00:20:30,So you wear your hat like a lot of places do when you graduate and you can attach things to it a bit like what they call those bracelets like a charm bracelet.
00:20:30,00:20:31,So you touch things on.
00:20:31,00:20:37,"So if you spend the night in a tree, you're allowed to put a stick in your cat."
00:20:37,00:20:41,If you eat a Big Mac hamburger in two bites.
00:20:41,00:20:42,Two bites.
00:20:42,00:20:43,Yeah.
00:20:43,00:20:46,They're a lot smaller than they look on the adverts.
00:20:46,00:20:47,Okay.
00:20:47,00:20:51,But you get a little piece of Big Mac wrapping and you can put that on.
00:20:51,00:20:55,"If you can drink a bottle of wine in 20 minutes, you get a wine cork."
00:20:55,00:21:05,"And if you can crawl through a supermarket while barking and biting customers legs, then you get a dog biscuit."
00:21:05,00:21:09,Do you have to prove you can do it because I can do that.
00:21:09,00:21:10,Oh yeah.
00:21:10,00:21:11,I think you've got to do it.
00:21:11,00:21:12,I can do it.
00:21:12,00:21:13,Go on.
00:21:13,00:21:14,You have to do it.
00:21:14,00:21:17,I'll do it later after the wine thing.
00:21:17,00:21:21,"You know, if you're going to Cambridge, if you want to graduate, you have to pull someone's finger."
00:21:21,00:21:23,This is a genuine ritual they have.
00:21:23,00:21:24,Oh really?
00:21:24,00:21:25,Yeah.
00:21:25,00:21:26,And they always fart.
00:21:26,00:21:27,"Wait, what's the point?"
00:21:27,00:21:28,Do you fart?
00:21:28,00:21:29,"Yeah, yeah."
00:21:29,00:21:30,Pull my finger and you.
00:21:30,00:21:31,That's the joke.
00:21:31,00:21:32,Pull my finger.
00:21:32,00:21:33,Yeah.
00:21:33,00:21:34,Thank you.
00:21:34,00:21:40,"Well at Cambridge, four of you pull someone's finger at the same time and it's like a don, a sort of lecturer and he toes you towards the place where you get your degree."
00:21:40,00:21:43,Just farting the whole way.
00:21:43,00:21:48,The coolest don in the world who does a quadruple fart as the underground tell his finger.
00:21:48,00:21:58,"It's very hard to maintain four different notes at the same time, but it can be done."
00:21:58,00:22:02,It is time for fact number three and that is Anna.
00:22:02,00:22:09,My fact is that California's international wine industry was started by a samurai.
00:22:09,00:22:10,Wow.
00:22:10,00:22:11,Yeah.
00:22:11,00:22:15,"That sounds like a chat GBT made up that fact, doesn't it?"
00:22:15,00:22:23,Sounds like they've taken all of our facts from history and just like the Portuguese sushi industry was started by a snowman.
00:22:23,00:22:24,Yeah.
00:22:24,00:22:25,They shoved two random nouns together.
00:22:25,00:22:29,Come up with an amazing fact in the style of popular podcast.
00:22:29,00:22:30,No such thing as a fish.
00:22:30,00:22:32,That's what I've started doing.
00:22:32,00:22:33,Okay.
00:22:33,00:22:34,Is he live?
00:22:34,00:22:35,I outsource.
00:22:35,00:22:36,"No, this is a real samurai."
00:22:36,00:22:37,They also have swords.
00:22:37,00:22:45,I know who I'm backing in a samurai versus Finnish doctor sword fight.
00:22:45,00:22:48,"Well, it's a drunk samurai at this point because he started a vineyard."
00:22:48,00:22:49,Yeah.
00:22:49,00:22:51,"But still, this has started in 1864, this tale."
00:22:51,00:22:58,And there were 19 young samurai from a part of Edo era Japan to the Kagoshima Peninsula.
00:22:58,00:22:59,And they were smuggled out.
00:22:59,00:23:03,"So this is when Japan was very isolationist, didn't want any contact with the outside world."
00:23:03,00:23:08,"But the samurai family said, you must go to the West and learn all of their technology and stuff."
00:23:08,00:23:18,"19 sent away, there was this one guy who was called Kanai in Nagasawa, who ended up via Scotland in California."
00:23:18,00:23:21,"And sorry, he was called Kanai and he went West."
00:23:21,00:23:23,Probably not relevant.
00:23:23,00:23:24,Nice.
00:23:24,00:23:25,He did change his name.
00:23:25,00:23:26,He wasn't originally called that.
00:23:26,00:23:30,So maybe it was in prediction of the Kanai West that we all know and love today.
00:23:30,00:23:32,Why did he go there?
00:23:32,00:23:37,"He went there because he basically befriended in Scotland this kind of religious cult leader called Thomas Lake Harris,"
00:23:37,00:23:40,"who said, I think we should try and set up a vineyard in California."
00:23:40,00:23:42,Can you be the guy who does all the grapes?
00:23:42,00:23:43,And he did.
00:23:43,00:23:45,And he became the wine king.
00:23:45,00:23:47,He was known as the wine king of California.
00:23:47,00:23:50,He really rocketed Californian wine sales.
00:23:50,00:23:55,He was the first person ever to market Californian wine outside of America.
00:23:55,00:23:57,"And yeah, he was a huge deal."
00:23:57,00:23:59,"It produced more than 200,000 gallons of wine a year."
00:23:59,00:24:01,And he was just this samurai.
00:24:01,00:24:02,Wow.
00:24:02,00:24:03,When was it?
00:24:03,00:24:04,This.
00:24:04,00:24:05,So it was 1864 that they left.
00:24:05,00:24:08,And I think it was huge by about the late 1870s.
00:24:08,00:24:09,It was a big deal.
00:24:09,00:24:11,"Oh, so it's like basically it's gold."
00:24:11,00:24:12,Gold rush era.
00:24:12,00:24:13,Yeah.
00:24:13,00:24:17,"And California was making wine before that, but this is when it really rocketed."
00:24:17,00:24:18,Yeah.
00:24:18,00:24:19,Very cool guy.
00:24:19,00:24:23,"This guy who was the guru spiritualist above him, Thomas Lake Harris."
00:24:23,00:24:25,Fascinating character.
00:24:25,00:24:29,He ran a thing called the Brotherhood of New Life.
00:24:29,00:24:34,"And he claimed that you could breathe the ether, which would give you divine air,"
00:24:34,00:24:37,as opposed to the actual oxygen that we have.
00:24:37,00:24:38,Quick question.
00:24:38,00:24:39,Sorry.
00:24:39,00:24:40,Yep.
00:24:40,00:24:43,How do you take an ether without breathing?
00:24:43,00:24:44,Through pseudoscience.
00:24:44,00:24:48,"Oh, thank you."
00:24:48,00:24:49,Yeah.
00:24:49,00:24:51,Through bullshit.
00:24:51,00:24:52,Yeah.
00:24:52,00:24:54,He also thought that you could breathe through your spleen.
00:24:54,00:24:58,So he said bypass the lungs and get that right to the spleen.
00:24:58,00:25:03,He was an interesting and air quotes around that character.
00:25:03,00:25:06,"He weirdly, it was a cult he ran."
00:25:06,00:25:12,He forbade alcohol from being consumed and then started a winery with the samurai.
00:25:12,00:25:17,Is he the one who thought the fairies existed and even thought that he married a fairy?
00:25:17,00:25:20,"Oh, maybe it sounds a bit like him."
00:25:20,00:25:21,I like him though.
00:25:21,00:25:23,I think a lot of what he was saying was metaphor.
00:25:23,00:25:25,What is breathing in the ether but Buddhism?
00:25:25,00:25:27,"He's basically a Buddhist, right?"
00:25:27,00:25:33,"Saying that deep breaths, with deep breaths you can achieve spiritual harmony."
00:25:33,00:25:36,"And there was a journalist called Alziere Chevalier,"
00:25:36,00:25:41,"who was this woman who was a bit of a muckraking journalist, in my view,"
00:25:41,00:25:44,who came and she said that they were all the people in this cult
00:25:44,00:25:48,were being made to perform strange sex acts and have baths together.
00:25:48,00:25:50,I think some of that might have been happening.
00:25:50,00:25:52,"Yes, and it might have been."
00:25:52,00:25:57,Why are you sticking up for this cult leader?
00:25:57,00:26:02,"I read a couple of biographies which, fair enough, came out before she released her book in 1894,"
00:26:02,00:26:04,which made him sound like a really nice guy.
00:26:04,00:26:05,Right.
00:26:05,00:26:08,"Yeah, they can be persuasive cult leaders though, I suppose."
00:26:08,00:26:11,"When I start my cult, you're the first person I'm coming to as a convert."
00:26:11,00:26:13,You are an easy mark.
00:26:13,00:26:16,"I think there was a bit of weird sex stuff going on,"
00:26:16,00:26:19,but what they were taught is that sex would be much better in the afterlife.
00:26:19,00:26:23,They would be having sex with fairies and angels and stuff like that.
00:26:23,00:26:27,And I actually think that sex might have been better in the afterlife for those guys
00:26:27,00:26:34,"because their form of safe sex was to press very, very hard on the testicles to avoid ejaculation."
00:26:34,00:26:38,But it works.
00:26:38,00:26:41,I feel saying that wouldn't be fun for you.
00:26:41,00:26:43,I'll try anything else.
00:26:43,00:26:46,"I think very, very hard is a movable feast of a phrase."
00:26:46,00:26:49,"I think we need to, yeah, gosh."
00:26:49,00:26:55,We should say that the wine king's fortunes were taken down in the 20th century.
00:26:55,00:26:58,"So he remained very wealthy, like ran this huge vineyard,"
00:26:58,00:27:01,"lots of other vineyards set up as a result,"
00:27:01,00:27:03,"and then the Second World War happened,"
00:27:03,00:27:06,"which, spoiler, wasn't good for Japanese people in America,"
00:27:06,00:27:09,and they all had their land taken away.
00:27:09,00:27:11,"But now his property has been restored,"
00:27:11,00:27:16,"and you can still see, although it's quite singed from a recent horrible wildfire,"
00:27:16,00:27:20,"his samurai sword, because they had to leave their swords behind in Japan"
00:27:20,00:27:22,"when they were sent away as kids, he went back and got it,"
00:27:22,00:27:27,and it now hangs on the wall of this vineyard sort of shed.
00:27:27,00:27:28,That's very cool.
00:27:28,00:27:29,That is very cool.
00:27:29,00:27:32,"I was looking a bit into Californian wines,"
00:27:32,00:27:37,"and it's interesting because the origins were part of mysticism, right,"
00:27:37,00:27:42,"this weird spiritualism, that still kind of remains in America and California."
00:27:42,00:27:44,"There are many wines that are grown,"
00:27:44,00:27:49,"and everything is treated via biodynamic wine, a treatment."
00:27:49,00:27:50,What's that?
00:27:50,00:27:53,"This is a thing that was created by a man called Rudolf Steiner,"
00:27:53,00:27:56,"who is also the reason that I never graduated,"
00:27:56,00:27:58,"because I went to a Rudolf Steiner school,"
00:27:58,00:28:00,and they didn't let me graduate.
00:28:00,00:28:02,"They were giving you wine every day, weren't they?"
00:28:02,00:28:04,"Yeah, I was too pissed to show up to graduation."
00:28:04,00:28:06,"You told us that instead of learning history,"
00:28:06,00:28:09,"you learned about holding a vibrating metal pole,"
00:28:09,00:28:11,and I don't know if you were joking.
00:28:11,00:28:12,I think you probably were.
00:28:12,00:28:13,"No, not instead."
00:28:13,00:28:17,"I do history class, and then I do holding a vibrating metal pole class afterwards."
00:28:17,00:28:19,"It's called urythmi, it's a dance."
00:28:19,00:28:20,Anyone done urythmi?
00:28:20,00:28:22,"No, okay."
00:28:22,00:28:24,Just for the audience.
00:28:24,00:28:26,"Ironically, you went, ""You with me?"""
00:28:26,00:28:28,And no one was with you.
00:28:28,00:28:30,"Yeah, okay, so this is what it's done."
00:28:30,00:28:31,This is part of it.
00:28:31,00:28:34,They do things like they will bury cow horns
00:28:34,00:28:37,that's filled with fermented manure into their vineyards.
00:28:37,00:28:40,"They will prune and harvest based on lunar cycle,"
00:28:40,00:28:43,"and they believe that if you use crushed quartz,"
00:28:43,00:28:45,"it's basically homeopathy,"
00:28:45,00:28:47,which is used to make the wine grapes grow better.
00:28:47,00:28:51,But the weird thing is there were multiple award-winning Californian wines
00:28:51,00:28:54,that are grown by using the biodynamic Rudolf Steiner principles.
00:28:54,00:28:58,"I bet they use other normal wine-growing principles alongside them, don't they?"
00:28:58,00:29:00,"I bet they water them and stuff, too."
00:29:00,00:29:03,"They are a world-winning, a lot of California wines."
00:29:03,00:29:04,Yeah.
00:29:04,00:29:06,"And that really goes back to 1976,"
00:29:06,00:29:10,when there was a big competition where they put all the best French wines
00:29:10,00:29:14,"against the load of California wines in France,"
00:29:14,00:29:16,"and they invited a load of journalists over,"
00:29:16,00:29:18,and only one journalist showed up
00:29:18,00:29:21,because they assumed that the French wines would win everything.
00:29:21,00:29:23,"It's called the Judgment of Paris,"
00:29:23,00:29:26,"and it turned out that the Californian wines won,"
00:29:26,00:29:28,and they were the tastiest ones.
00:29:28,00:29:29,"Wait, the judges were French?"
00:29:29,00:29:30,They were French.
00:29:30,00:29:35,"One of the judges, Odette Kahn, who was the editor of a French wine magazine,"
00:29:35,00:29:38,she demanded her scorecard back
00:29:38,00:29:40,because she didn't want anyone to know that she voted
00:29:40,00:29:42,for the California wines ahead of her friend.
00:29:42,00:29:44,They must have hated that.
00:29:44,00:29:47,It was horrendous for France.
00:29:47,00:29:48,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
00:29:48,00:29:50,That's so much fun.
00:29:50,00:29:53,"It sounds like the most fun moment for the rest of the world in history,"
00:29:53,00:29:56,"because it was even the people who organized the contest,"
00:29:56,00:29:58,who were a Californian wine grower and the British guy
00:29:58,00:30:00,"who ran a wine company in France, were like,"
00:30:00,00:30:03,"""Obviously the Californian wines are shit compared to the French wines,"
00:30:03,00:30:05,"but we'll see what the tasters think."""
00:30:05,00:30:07,"And the tasters were there, and they were, sorry,"
00:30:07,00:30:10,"I almost tried a French accent then, and I retreated really fast."
00:30:10,00:30:12,"But they were the best wine tasters in France,"
00:30:12,00:30:14,"and they'd taste a wine and say,"
00:30:14,00:30:16,"""Ah, delicious, back in France again,"""
00:30:16,00:30:18,and it would be from the Napa Valley.
00:30:18,00:30:19,"Oh, I love it."
00:30:19,00:30:20,"And they were just great,"
00:30:20,00:30:22,and a bunch of them were fired from their jobs
00:30:22,00:30:26,and cut out of wine societies that they were in
00:30:26,00:30:29,after bringing this disgrace to France.
00:30:29,00:30:33,"I'm going to get off the Euro star on the way home tomorrow in Lille,"
00:30:33,00:30:36,and I'm going to ask them if they have any lovely Californian wine
00:30:36,00:30:38,I've heard so much about.
00:30:38,00:30:39,"Oh, I can't wait. I can't wait."
00:30:39,00:30:44,"The thing is about wine tasting is a lot of it is kind of mediup-y, isn't it?"
00:30:44,00:30:48,"Yeah, and it doesn't really hold up to scrutiny a lot of it."
00:30:48,00:30:51,There was a guy called Robert Hodgson who did a...
00:30:51,00:30:52,"He actually made wine,"
00:30:52,00:30:55,and he checked the results of a load of competitions
00:30:55,00:30:59,"and found that his wines, in one competition, they'd get like 95%,"
00:30:59,00:31:01,"and then in another one, they'd get 65%,"
00:31:01,00:31:03,"and it was exactly the same wine,"
00:31:03,00:31:04,"and he couldn't understand why,"
00:31:04,00:31:07,and so he did a study where he blindfolded wine experts
00:31:07,00:31:10,"and gave them three different wines and said,"
00:31:10,00:31:13,"""Can you explain what they are and give them a score out of 100?"""
00:31:13,00:31:15,"And they gave them all different scores,"
00:31:15,00:31:17,but he gave them the same wine three times.
00:31:17,00:31:22,"And there's been another one where they gave people two glasses of wine,"
00:31:22,00:31:24,"one was white, one was red,"
00:31:24,00:31:25,"and then they said, ""What do you think?"""
00:31:25,00:31:26,And they liked the red one.
00:31:26,00:31:29,"""Oh, yeah, there's hints of berries and there's hints of jamminess"
00:31:29,00:31:30,"and all this kind of stuff."""
00:31:30,00:31:34,"But actually, it was white wine with red food colouring in it,"
00:31:34,00:31:36,and they couldn't tell the difference between the two.
00:31:36,00:31:38,"When the temperature was the same, they couldn't tell the difference."
00:31:38,00:31:40,"So, whole things a sham."
00:31:40,00:31:43,"I wouldn't say the whole things a sham, but I think a lot of it is."
00:31:43,00:31:44,Wow.
00:31:44,00:31:45,Okay.
00:31:45,00:31:49,I'm going to buy that two euro wine bottle I saw earlier there.
00:31:49,00:31:51,"Well, that's what all other drinks is, isn't it?"
00:31:51,00:31:53,Exactly. This is why I stick to the hawk.
00:31:53,00:31:54,And you'll be fine.
00:31:54,00:31:57,Do you know what the fastest growing wine in the history of America's wine industry is?
00:31:57,00:31:58,The fastest growing wine?
00:31:58,00:31:59,Yeah.
00:31:59,00:32:00,You mean physically the grapes?
00:32:00,00:32:01,"No, sorry."
00:32:01,00:32:06,"I mean, as in they sold not many, and then loads, and then loads, and then even more."
00:32:06,00:32:07,Have we heard of it?
00:32:07,00:32:08,Is it...?
00:32:08,00:32:09,Possibly not.
00:32:09,00:32:12,"Oh, well, this is a shit, please."
00:32:12,00:32:14,Is it a famous kind of wine?
00:32:14,00:32:15,It's famous in America.
00:32:15,00:32:17,It's called Two Buck Chuck.
00:32:17,00:32:18,"Oh, that sounds lovely."
00:32:18,00:32:23,And it is white wine that costs $199 in dollars per bottle.
00:32:23,00:32:28,"Actually, now due to the cost of living, it is $3.49 per bottle."
00:32:28,00:32:35,"But for many, many years, it was started in 2002, and for probably about 15 years, they kept it under $2."
00:32:35,00:32:40,"And the way they did it is they just took all their off the bits that's left from all the different wine growers,"
00:32:40,00:32:44,and then they brought it to this factory and mixed it all together and sold it for cheap.
00:32:44,00:32:51,"But the thing was, their factory was in the Napa Valley, so they could put Napa Valley on all of the labels."
00:32:51,00:32:56,I still don't think however cheap I'd buy a wine that had a synonym for vomit in its name.
00:32:56,00:32:59,I think we'd work on the title.
00:32:59,00:33:08,"The first ever vineyard planted in California was in 1769, and it was by a man who used to whip himself with spikes."
00:33:08,00:33:09,Okay.
00:33:09,00:33:15,"This was because wines were often grown, as you know in Belgium similarly with beer, by weird religious people."
00:33:15,00:33:17,And he was one of them.
00:33:17,00:33:27,"And this was in San Diego, and he was a guy called Father Junipero Serra, which is weird because his name is Juniper, which is gin."
00:33:27,00:33:29,And Serra is a kind of wine.
00:33:29,00:33:31,Serra is a kind of wine.
00:33:31,00:33:33,"I mean, he's all over the place."
00:33:33,00:33:41,"And yeah, he was a Franciscan monk, and he planted the very first Californian vines, and they were the main ones growing for about 100 years."
00:33:41,00:33:48,But he also used to wear sackcloths with lots of spikes on the inside that jammed into him as he walked.
00:33:48,00:33:52,You know what? The first monk to turn that inside out were the spikes on the outside.
00:33:52,00:33:55,That was punk. That was punk.
00:33:55,00:33:58,"Like, it rhymes with monk, it's punk."
00:33:58,00:34:03,And the Monarch for whether you're talking to a monk or a punk.
00:34:03,00:34:16,"All right, we do need to get to our final fact of the show. It is time for our final fact of the show, and that is James."
00:34:16,00:34:22,"Okay, my fact this week is that some donkeys keep sheep in their pockets."
00:34:22,00:34:23,Now.
00:34:23,00:34:25,There we are.
00:34:25,00:34:27,There's a picture on the screen.
00:34:27,00:34:29,"Anna, why don't you describe what you're looking at?"
00:34:29,00:34:36,"What I'm seeing is a donkey with pockets, wearing a coat with pockets to be fair, and some really cute lambs poking out of them."
00:34:36,00:34:37,Why are they doing that?
00:34:37,00:34:47,"Well, they are being taken to high pastures to the top of mountains where they can feed, and it's very difficult to transport newborn lambs."
00:34:47,00:34:53,"Because you can't really, you can't put them on a car because the roads aren't so good, like a four by four, I guess, or something like that."
00:34:53,00:34:57,But actually the donkeys are really good at getting up the mountains.
00:34:57,00:35:00,And so you want to put your sheep with your donkeys.
00:35:00,00:35:05,And a donkey realistically is quite difficult for a donkey to carry a sheep.
00:35:05,00:35:10,So it needs to have some kind of outfit where you've got little pockets where you can put the sheep in.
00:35:10,00:35:11,It is adorable.
00:35:11,00:35:14,"And this happens in Lombardy, a good wine region."
00:35:14,00:35:15,Right.
00:35:15,00:35:17,"Apparently not, not anymore."
00:35:17,00:35:24,"And they have these little, they can stick their heads out so they can see where they're going because they think very sweet."
00:35:24,00:35:26,They might get travel sick or something otherwise.
00:35:26,00:35:28,"Yeah, so nice."
00:35:28,00:35:30,Donkeys have a lot of different uses.
00:35:30,00:35:31,"Oh, yeah."
00:35:31,00:35:35,You can name an activity and a donkey can help.
00:35:35,00:35:36,Golf.
00:35:36,00:35:37,Golf.
00:35:37,00:35:38,Yeah.
00:35:38,00:35:40,"Oh, yeah."
00:35:40,00:35:41,Caddy.
00:35:41,00:35:42,The donkey caddy.
00:35:42,00:35:43,Okay.
00:35:43,00:35:45,"I picked, I actually picked quite an easy one."
00:35:45,00:35:46,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:35:46,00:35:49,"Unfortunately, that's the first activity that comes into my head in all circumstances."
00:35:49,00:35:50,Okay.
00:35:50,00:35:52,"Well, there are guard donkeys in France."
00:35:52,00:35:57,"There's a bit of the Atlantic coast, which is called Poitou Charotte."
00:35:57,00:36:04,"And there are guard donkeys there because France has a lot more wolves than it, well, lots of Europe has a lot more wolves than it used to."
00:36:04,00:36:14,"They've been reintroduced and they can sometimes prey on sheep, not in Poitou Charotte where the donkeys are so aggressive and so big and so frightening."
00:36:14,00:36:19,"And they will, they will find a wolf and run towards it and kick it in the head that the wolves just don't even try anymore."
00:36:19,00:36:20,Right.
00:36:20,00:36:21,Wow.
00:36:21,00:36:23,These are bigger donkeys than an average donkey.
00:36:23,00:36:25,They are larger than the average donkey.
00:36:25,00:36:26,Yeah.
00:36:26,00:36:27,Great.
00:36:27,00:36:28,Because otherwise it's embarrassing.
00:36:28,00:36:31,"I think it's a wolf to go back to your pack and say, there was a donkey."
00:36:31,00:36:32,"Oh, it's embarrassing either way."
00:36:32,00:36:33,Yeah.
00:36:33,00:36:34,"Well, a donkey."
00:36:34,00:36:35,He's massive.
00:36:35,00:36:36,He's massive.
00:36:36,00:36:37,It's more like a horse.
00:36:37,00:36:38,Yeah.
00:36:38,00:36:41,So there's a story about the donkeys.
00:36:41,00:36:43,Beehives used to be transported by donkeys.
00:36:43,00:36:48,"So they would put wooden hives on the side of them and they would, I guess, walk very carefully towards where they were going."
00:36:48,00:37:01,"There's a story which kind of has like bled into legend, but I will continue to talk despite being a factual podcast where supposedly the relics of saints, if they were transporting them, a donkey would transport it."
00:37:01,00:37:05,Because donkeys obviously very tied in to religious iconography.
00:37:05,00:37:06,Right.
00:37:06,00:37:07,"Jesus, you know, there was a donkey in the manger."
00:37:07,00:37:09,According to the main story and so on.
00:37:09,00:37:12,And so Jesus rode on a donkey on paths and days.
00:37:12,00:37:13,Yeah.
00:37:13,00:37:14,So it's very much that.
00:37:14,00:37:16,So the idea was that if you were taking.
00:37:16,00:37:17,Sorry.
00:37:17,00:37:21,Can I just say I don't think the donkey was in the manger so much as beside it looking at.
00:37:21,00:37:23,I think Jesus was on his own in the manger.
00:37:23,00:37:24,What is the manger?
00:37:24,00:37:25,"It's the crib, isn't it?"
00:37:25,00:37:26,Yeah.
00:37:26,00:37:29,I thought the crib was the crib and the manger was the room.
00:37:29,00:37:32,"God, he would have stuffed all those farm animals straight into the crib."
00:37:32,00:37:36,"Well, that's why my nativity play was received very badly at school."
00:37:36,00:37:39,And it was controversial.
00:37:39,00:37:46,"There is a song actually of a Christmas, which is Little Donkey, which is about how their Jesus, Mary and Joseph are going to Bethlehem."
00:37:46,00:37:49,And Mary sits on the donkey and goes along.
00:37:49,00:37:50,Okay.
00:37:50,00:37:52,And Jesus is going inside Mary's tummy at that point.
00:37:52,00:37:53,"Yes, absolutely."
00:37:53,00:37:54,Yes.
00:37:54,00:37:57,But actually women did not ride donkeys in those days in the Holy Land.
00:37:57,00:37:58,Really?
00:37:58,00:38:00,Only men would ride donkeys.
00:38:00,00:38:04,"So the man would have been on while the woman, even though she was pregnant, would have been walking behind."
00:38:04,00:38:05,No.
00:38:05,00:38:06,Generally speaking.
00:38:06,00:38:07,Wow.
00:38:07,00:38:08,Wow.
00:38:08,00:38:09,That is the one problem.
00:38:09,00:38:10,Not really.
00:38:10,00:38:14,"If you're Joseph, you're going, I don't even know whose baby this is anyway."
00:38:14,00:38:18,"How does this happen, love?"
00:38:18,00:38:19,Keep walking.
00:38:19,00:38:20,Yeah.
00:38:20,00:38:27,"And actually, if you look at a donkey from above today, most donkeys, they've got like,"
00:38:27,00:38:32,they've got some hair that goes across their shoulders and then they've got a line of hair that goes across their back.
00:38:32,00:38:34,And it looks like a cross.
00:38:34,00:38:35,That's another reason why it's quite religious.
00:38:35,00:38:36,Sign of the cross.
00:38:36,00:38:37,That's great.
00:38:37,00:38:38,Is that why it's called the mange?
00:38:38,00:38:39,What?
00:38:39,00:38:40,Is that what it's called?
00:38:40,00:38:41,It's called the mane.
00:38:41,00:38:42,It's not called the mange.
00:38:42,00:38:44,Unless you've got a mangy donkey.
00:38:44,00:38:45,"Wait, wait."
00:38:45,00:38:47,Aren't we away in a manger here?
00:38:47,00:38:49,Are we trying to say there's no link?
00:38:49,00:38:53,Are we trying to say Dan's just misheard something and not understood it?
00:38:53,00:38:54,"Yes, we are."
00:38:54,00:38:55,Carry on.
00:38:55,00:38:58,I wish I graduated.
00:38:58,00:39:03,"In Britain, one of our main hobbies is preserving the lives of elderly donkeys."
00:39:03,00:39:04,It's a big thing.
00:39:04,00:39:08,"It's a big, like, lots of big donkey charities in the UK."
00:39:08,00:39:10,Do you have big donkey charities here?
00:39:10,00:39:15,"Like, basically, if you watch TV in the middle of the day, then there'll be an advertisement saying,"
00:39:15,00:39:18,"""Please leave all your money to a donkey sanctuary when you die."""
00:39:18,00:39:20,And people do in their thousands.
00:39:20,00:39:22,They leave all their money to the donkeys.
00:39:22,00:39:29,"So you guys, who do old sad people leave their money to when they die if not to donkey sanctuaries?"
00:39:29,00:39:34,I literally don't understand where all that money would go if you didn't have donkey sanctuaries as an option.
00:39:34,00:39:36,It's what happens to all of it.
00:39:36,00:39:37,You guys are weird.
00:39:37,00:39:46,I went to the donkey sanctuary barmouth website and I had some just great donkey facts that I have not checked.
00:39:46,00:39:52,"But fact number two, donkeys can see all four feet at the same time."
00:39:52,00:39:54,I have checked that and it's not true.
00:39:54,00:39:55,Have you?
00:39:55,00:39:56,"Yeah, I have."
00:39:56,00:39:58,"Also, why did you start with fact number two?"
00:39:58,00:40:02,"Fact number one was even more boring than that one, if you can imagine that."
00:40:02,00:40:05,We don't have to stick to the sanctuary's numbering system.
00:40:05,00:40:06,Fact number 12.
00:40:06,00:40:13,This is when I realised this list of donkey facts was suspicious.
00:40:13,00:40:20,A donkey's prey will carry up to 60 miles in the desert.
00:40:20,00:40:25,I just don't think that can be true.
00:40:25,00:40:27,"It doesn't seem very likely, does it?"
00:40:27,00:40:28,60 miles!
00:40:28,00:40:31,Is that donkey to donkey though or to human?
00:40:31,00:40:34,"Is it like, you know how dogs can hear a different, higher sound?"
00:40:34,00:40:38,You'd think that it would not be audible to predator animals.
00:40:38,00:40:43,"Like, there's a donkey 57 miles that way."
00:40:43,00:40:47,Just a little announcement that might have got passed a lot of people.
00:40:47,00:40:51,"Sadly, we lost one of the great donkeys this year, this January."
00:40:51,00:40:52,No.
00:40:52,00:40:53,"Yeah, Perry."
00:40:53,00:40:56,Perry the donkey has passed away age 30.
00:40:56,00:41:00,Perry was the inspiration for donkey from Shrek.
00:41:00,00:41:02,That was a real donkey.
00:41:02,00:41:05,"And when you see a photo, it looks exactly like donkey from Shrek."
00:41:05,00:41:07,"It's a donkey, yeah, he's a donkey."
00:41:07,00:41:10,"But his big, big old face, nose, tiny."
00:41:10,00:41:11,It's a donkey.
00:41:11,00:41:17,"Yeah, Perry was originally sent to California to help calm polo ponies."
00:41:17,00:41:20,So he would be calm them down and keep them chilled.
00:41:20,00:41:24,But things went bad when he bit every single one of them.
00:41:24,00:41:27,"Which is so Shrek donkey, right?"
00:41:27,00:41:28,"Also, good on him."
00:41:28,00:41:30,You pretentious dickheads playing polo.
00:41:30,00:41:32,That's what I do to polo players.
00:41:32,00:41:34,Wow.
00:41:34,00:41:39,Do you know what the biggest global threat to donkey welfare is at the moment?
00:41:39,00:41:40,Big horse.
00:41:40,00:41:42,Just one big horse?
00:41:42,00:41:43,The horse industry.
00:41:43,00:41:44,The horse industry.
00:41:44,00:41:45,They're competing.
00:41:45,00:41:47,People aren't breeding donkeys anymore.
00:41:47,00:41:50,"People banning, riding on them at the seaside."
00:41:50,00:41:54,Is it like the overweight children on Blackpool Beach trying to ride donkeys?
00:41:54,00:41:56,Because I know they have caused a problem.
00:41:56,00:41:57,They have banned them.
00:41:57,00:41:58,It is not that.
00:41:58,00:42:05,"It is China consume something called Ejio, which is a gelatin you make from donkey's skin."
00:42:05,00:42:09,And it's supposed to be good for you due to Chinese medicine in various different ways.
00:42:09,00:42:11,"In China, there were lots of donkeys there."
00:42:11,00:42:13,People are using them to move things around.
00:42:13,00:42:15,And so actually they have quite a lot of donkeys there.
00:42:15,00:42:18,"But more recently, when China has become more industrialized,"
00:42:18,00:42:20,people don't have donkeys anymore.
00:42:20,00:42:23,So they have to get their donkey skin from other countries.
00:42:23,00:42:27,"And they're importing loads and loads of donkey skins, especially from Africa."
00:42:27,00:42:34,And the number of donkeys in Botswana fell by 60% in the five years between 2011 and 2016.
00:42:34,00:42:35,Yikes.
00:42:35,00:42:36,Fifth in Lesotho.
00:42:36,00:42:40,And the price of donkey skins is going through the roof at the moment.
00:42:40,00:42:43,"If you had a thousand pounds at the start of 2017,"
00:42:43,00:42:46,"and you invested it in donkey skins for the first six months,"
00:42:46,00:42:48,"and Bitcoin for the second six months,"
00:42:48,00:42:51,"you would have ended up with £25,000,"
00:42:51,00:42:56,which would have been enough to buy a pair of cufflinks owned by Elvis.
00:42:56,00:43:00,"Again, you always guilt the lily train."
00:43:00,00:43:03,There was a sale that year of Elvis.
00:43:03,00:43:06,"Wait, sorry, is that £1,000 to £25?"
00:43:06,00:43:07,Yeah.
00:43:07,00:43:11,And you simply needed to be an expert in the field both of donkey skin and Bitcoin.
00:43:11,00:43:12,Yeah.
00:43:12,00:43:14,And get the time in exactly right.
00:43:14,00:43:15,Of course.
00:43:15,00:43:17,Laura of Everett did someone well have done that.
00:43:17,00:43:18,Yeah.
00:43:18,00:43:21,"I think donkey meat is quite a delicacy in China,"
00:43:21,00:43:29,although the Chinese branch of Walmart had to recall a bunch of five-spice donkey meat products in 2014.
00:43:29,00:43:32,"But that was because they tested them and they were full of Fox DNA,"
00:43:32,00:43:35,which is not a delicacy.
00:43:35,00:43:38,"So what, the donkeys have been eating foxes?"
00:43:38,00:43:42,"No, I don't think we're blaming the donkeys for contaminating the donkeys."
00:43:42,00:43:46,"We had the thing in the UK where beef products, like beef lasagna,"
00:43:46,00:43:50,turned out to be containing horse and donkey as well.
00:43:50,00:43:51,"Oh, was it?"
00:43:51,00:43:53,And so donkey meat then containing Fox.
00:43:53,00:43:55,So what's in my Fox Burgers?
00:43:55,00:43:56,That's what I want to know.
00:43:56,00:44:00,"It's the old woman who swallowed the fly, but the other way."
00:44:00,00:44:03,"Guys, I need to wrap us up in a saying."
00:44:03,00:44:05,Do you have Lyme disease here?
00:44:05,00:44:06,"What do you call it, that?"
00:44:06,00:44:08,"Okay, so really dangerous, obviously."
00:44:08,00:44:09,You get it from a tick.
00:44:09,00:44:13,You get bitten by a tick and it creates really bad for you Lyme disease.
00:44:13,00:44:19,"Anyway, so little bloodsuckers, donkeys and horses secrete this natural compound,"
00:44:19,00:44:22,which ticks can't cope with.
00:44:22,00:44:23,They hate it.
00:44:23,00:44:27,"So if you wrap yourself in a live donkey, you will be safe."
00:44:27,00:44:28,A live donkey?
00:44:28,00:44:30,I think it has to be a living donkey.
00:44:30,00:44:31,"Yeah, yeah."
00:44:31,00:44:35,How long is it going to be alive when you've wrapped it around yourself?
00:44:35,00:44:39,"You are going to need a fresh donkey after a little while, I think."
00:44:39,00:44:40,Wow.
00:44:40,00:44:44,"Anyway, just a tip for you there."
00:44:44,00:44:46,"And if you do die from Lyme disease,"
00:44:46,00:44:52,"consider donating all of your money to a donkey sanctuary, people of Belgium."
00:44:52,00:45:00,That is it.
00:45:00,00:45:01,That is all of our facts.
00:45:01,00:45:04,Thank you all of you for coming and sitting here and listening to us here
00:45:04,00:45:06,at the Nerdland Festival.
00:45:06,00:45:08,"If you want to get in contact with any of us,"
00:45:08,00:45:09,we're all on social media.
00:45:09,00:45:12,"I'm on @Tribaland on Instagram, Andy."
00:45:12,00:45:15,"@AndrewHunterM, various."
00:45:15,00:45:17,James.
00:45:17,00:45:21,No such thing as James Huck and equally various.
00:45:21,00:45:24,"Okay, and Anna, to get to us as a group."
00:45:24,00:45:28,You can email podcast@qi.com and that's just on email.
00:45:28,00:45:31,"And then on Instagram, where I know such thing as a fish."
