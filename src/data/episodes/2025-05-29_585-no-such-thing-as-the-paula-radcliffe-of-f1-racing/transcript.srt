00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:14,480
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,140
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,840
 a weekly podcast coming to you

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,800
 from the QI offices in Hoburn.

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,040
 My name's Dan Schreiber.

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,080
 It is a three-person podcast this week.

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,520
 Well, James is away on holiday.

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,820
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

10
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,000
 and once again, we have gathered around the microphones

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,080
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

12
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,120
 and in no particular order, here we go.

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,640
 Starting with fact number one, that is Anna.

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,000
 - My fact this week is that Essex Police

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,600
 has a team of six officers trained to grow cannabis.

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,520
 - What?

17
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,240
 - And that's, yeah, it's what you're funding

18
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,560
 with your taxpayer money. - My taxes.

19
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,240
 Funding the old wacky-backy,

20
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,760
 absolutely being grown by the police.

21
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,600
 - By the police. - And they don't--

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,440
 - It's outrageous.

23
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,340
 - It's ridiculous, they don't even send you any.

24
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,500
 - What's the deal?

25
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,100
 - Well, this is an interesting bit of British law anyway,

26
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,540
 which means that when the police make a big drug seizure,

27
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,500
 then they can work out what the value of the drugs

28
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,260
 would have been, and then claim that value

29
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:14,340
 back from the drug dealer's assets as like a disincentive.

30
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,620
 So it's like, hey, you've got 100 grand worth of drugs,

31
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,420
 I'll take your 100 grand car, or whatever.

32
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,260
 But they need to work out the value of the drugs.

33
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,700
 The problem is, when they come to a cannabis farm

34
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,700
 and it's not fully grown yet,

35
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,740
 then they haven't matured yet,

36
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:30,440
 they don't have that concentrated THC

37
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,120
 that's what gives cannabis its potency,

38
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,960
 then the dealers can claim it was never gonna be

39
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,160
 very valuable, or it's actually all moldy,

40
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,000
 it wasn't gonna work.

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 - So in court, the cheeky lawyers will jump in

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 and say, this was never gonna grow into anything,

43
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,640
 so you can't take anything away.

44
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,480
 - And it's actually discount November,

45
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,120
 so you have to take half off of that.

46
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,680
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

47
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,960
 You've got a voucher, if you've got the cannabis club card.

48
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,480
 - Just use the offer code, fish, and check out.

49
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,300
 - So they grow it themselves, basically, right?

50
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,060
 To prove how much it's gonna be worth.

51
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,660
 - Do they finish growing the whole crop?

52
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,780
 - Yeah, so at the moment, and this is just Essex Police,

53
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,500
 but I think other police forces are experimenting with it,

54
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,740
 they bust the farm and they take the plants

55
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,940
 and they put them in a special facility they have,

56
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:14,180
 and they nurture, grow, and dry the plants properly,

57
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,940
 and they've learned how to make it maximally profitable,

58
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,340
 just like the drug dealers would,

59
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,380
 assuming they're skilled cannabis growers,

60
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,140
 and then they work out how much it's worth,

61
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,900
 and then they burn it all.

62
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,620
 - Yeah, okay, okay, good.

63
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,580
 Not bit by bit, not joint by joint.

64
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,860
 - Hey, in a series of small fires, yeah.

65
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,160
 - You've got to think they siphon a tiny bit off,

66
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,300
 write in to podcast.qi.com, and we won't tell anyone.

67
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,140
 - Oh, I'll cross you off.

68
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,180
 If you're a bank copper, just look out.

69
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,560
 - Don't tell Andy, fine.

70
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,800
 - So they've recovered over 300 million pounds worth

71
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,260
 of what would be the trade for the cannabis

72
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,040
 over the last six years, and so they'll grow it,

73
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,080
 and they'll be like, okay, that on the street

74
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,040
 is worth 53,000 pounds, that's what you owe now.

75
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,120
 - Wow. - Yeah.

76
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,740
 - Because street value's a tricky thing, isn't it?

77
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,620
 'Cause obviously there's no price list you can look up,

78
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,620
 which is why I don't partake,

79
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,940
 because it's just too messy.

80
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,660
 I want to know, you know,

81
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,340
 that you don't have any consumer rights.

82
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,300
 - You'll get a text message with a picture of the price list.

83
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,220
 - Oh, okay.

84
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,660
 Your dealers are going to have laminated menus.

85
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,140
 You're going to have-- - I can't.

86
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,700
 - And which wines would you recommend with this skunk?

87
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,500
 I love, what I love about this fact is that

88
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,640
 it's this sort of like lateral thinking way of policing,

89
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,040
 which I find so interesting.

90
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,920
 There's so many methods that are going on now

91
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,240
 that we just don't even necessarily know about.

92
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,400
 Like for example, the police have been collaborating

93
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,120
 over the last 10 years with the national grid.

94
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,280
 So the frequency of the electricity

95
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,600
 that is being sent out to every home in England,

96
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,920
 Scotland, Wales, it's typically about 50 hertz,

97
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,440
 and that's the frequency that is being picked up

98
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,600
 in the background of every audio recording.

99
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,880
 If you're near a power source,

100
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,600
 that's going to be there as a low buzz.

101
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,980
 So in this room right now, we have electrical sockets.

102
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,540
 Every recording like this recording is picking up.

103
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,820
 The Hertz noise, very softly in the background.

104
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:04,060
 Now, it's not always 50 hertz, there's fluctuations.

105
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,820
 And that is because of the nature of supply and demand.

106
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,060
 Like when people are watching TV

107
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,220
 and it gets the ad breaks and lots of kettles go on,

108
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,820
 there are small fluctuations that go on on the national grid.

109
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,260
 And when that happens, it happens everywhere.

110
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,300
 Which means if you're recording all of the national grid,

111
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,420
 you're going to have timestamps

112
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,180
 on all of these fluctuations.

113
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,640
 So often now police, if they're in court

114
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,240
 and there's a recording of criminals

115
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,560
 that is being used, audio recording,

116
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,800
 and they say that never happened

117
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,400
 at this place at this time,

118
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,560
 they listen to the frequency in the background

119
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,920
 and they can match it to the exact time

120
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,080
 at the national grid, isn't that insane?

121
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:37,920
 Wow.

122
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,760
 Isn't that nuts?

123
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,600
 And that's been used in court

124
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,160
 and that has busted people

125
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,680
 who have claimed that the recordings were manufactured.

126
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,600
 And it didn't happen when it was said to happen.

127
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,760
 Oh my God, so cover up your plug sockets,

128
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,600
 is what you're saying.

129
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,840
 Do all your mugging by the trees.

130
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,080
 Just be away from, and don't record it.

131
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,280
 Don't worry, you're recording it.

132
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,120
 Just don't record it.

133
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,460
 Oh yeah, good point.

134
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,800
 That's pretty good, isn't that stunning?

135
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,900
 So that's called electric network frequency

136
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,520
 and they've been doing it for 10 years now.

137
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,360
 This makes my clever cop workaround thing

138
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,080
 look much less impressive.

139
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,600
 But this is what I quite like recently.

140
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,600
 Did you see the two undercover policemen

141
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,680
 who dressed up as Batman and Robin?

142
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,280
 Okay, no.

143
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,680
 It's not as high-tech, but it worked.

144
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,080
 It was Inspector Darren Watson

145
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,120
 and Police Constable Abdi Osman

146
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,720
 and they were patrolling around London

147
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,040
 and they're looking for scammers

148
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,680
 who were playing illegal rigged gambling games

149
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,520
 of tourists and getting loads of money off them.

150
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,520
 But people knew their faces by then.

151
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,520
 And so one of them said,

152
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,960
 "I just remembered I had Batman and Robin costumes

153
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,280
 "in my house, which could come in useful."

154
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,060
 And they dressed up and they're so bad.

155
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,680
 So there's pictures of them arresting these guys

156
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,880
 that they've come up to.

157
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,840
 And the guy dressed as Robin

158
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,280
 is wearing a beige bucket hat with his Robin.

159
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,320
 And the bucket hat is the only thing

160
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,840
 that's concealing his face, actually.

161
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,080
 So I don't know why he's wearing the full Robin gear.

162
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,920
 He's wearing Robin gear.

163
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,400
 - 'Cause I think if he was wearing a police officer's

164
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,800
 outfit but a beige bucket hat,

165
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,720
 the wrongs might still spot that.

166
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,960
 - I suppose.

167
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,280
 - But that's effective, isn't it?

168
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,120
 - It works.

169
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,960
 - I think that's really good.

170
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,160
 I mean, you don't know how many people

171
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,040
 are undercover officers.

172
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,800
 Look around you, like all those living statues.

173
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,640
 - Come on.

174
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,480
 - Yeah.

175
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,720
 - You're trying to tell me that not one of them is a fed.

176
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,200
 Or who is a fake police officer the other way around?

177
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,560
 Someone pretending to be a police officer.

178
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,400
 So there was a thing.

179
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,360
 Remember the TV show, "The Bill" 2010 that ended?

180
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,800
 The police force basically had to buy all of the costumes

181
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,280
 off of the bill because they were real police costumes.

182
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,120
 - Really?

183
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,960
 - Yeah, yeah.

184
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,800
 - And burn them.

185
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,320
 - Weirdly, they handed them out

186
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,080
 and they were being worn by actual policemen.

187
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:41,320
 So they reused the clothing of the bill, the TV show.

188
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,840
 - They had so exciting for those clothes

189
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,160
 'cause that's like a promotion, isn't it?

190
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,000
 - Yeah.

191
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,600
 - I do have this, now I've seen it in my head

192
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,880
 as quite nice relationship.

193
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,960
 And I think no one else sees that.

194
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,760
 But basically that very famous day

195
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,640
 of the last few years, drill music has become associated

196
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,640
 with gang crime.

197
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,040
 And the lyrics of drill songs will reference people

198
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,800
 who've been murdered on the streets.

199
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,440
 And like say, I'm going to get you to a rival gang.

200
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,280
 - Would it say that kind of,

201
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,920
 even that kind of foul language is you?

202
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,080
 - I don't know if I go that far, but.

203
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,520
 - Which one of us is going to just buckle

204
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,400
 and actually ask what drill is?

205
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,240
 - Not me.

206
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,000
 - Okay, me, though, continue.

207
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,720
 - Hang on, you guys don't listen to drill music

208
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,560
 in your spare time.

209
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,240
 - Is that like heavy rap, right?

210
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,480
 In terms of like lyrically.

211
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,720
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

212
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,760
 - I listen to road works,

213
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,000
 but that's because I'm really interested in infrastructure.

214
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,840
 So, yeah.

215
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,800
 - Yeah, that's exactly what I'm talking about.

216
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,240
 You go on believing that that's what I'm referencing.

217
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,720
 - Oh yeah, Silver Town Tunnel Classics.

218
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,560
 Yeah, great.

219
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,960
 Oh, Thames Tideway Tunnel.

220
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,520
 Yeah, I'm digging it.

221
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,520
 - Well, I really like the idea

222
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,640
 that you would join the police and misunderstand this,

223
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,880
 'cause in Manchester, basically,

224
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,480
 the police have been recruited to,

225
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,240
 and it's called the Excalibur Task Force,

226
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,160
 which is trying to stop knife crime,

227
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,840
 recruited to get lots of intelligence from drill music.

228
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,080
 So, if you were employed by them,

229
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,320
 I guess you would go and eavesdrop on building sites.

230
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,960
 What you're meant to do is watch loads of YouTube videos

231
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,960
 and then pick up the names that are being dropped

232
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,800
 and figure out who's pissed off about what,

233
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,560
 'cause it's referencing real things.

234
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,960
 - Oh, right, okay, right.

235
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,800
 - It's like pre-crime,

236
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,720
 but the pre-crimes have maybe been turned into songs.

237
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,080
 - Exactly.

238
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,560
 And then just, yeah, so you know where to keep a watch out,

239
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,880
 but then the drill artists know the police are watching them,

240
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,840
 so then they'll reference the police in return.

241
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,680
 So as long as they'll be like,

242
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,520
 "Oh, you Excalibur naughty boys spying on us."

243
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,080
 - Do they put out fake news as well?

244
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:27,920
 Do they say--

245
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,760
 - Well, they should, shouldn't they?

246
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,800
 - Yeah, we're gonna get Mr. Banana tonight

247
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,800
 down by the old co-op.

248
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,920
 And actually, there is no Mr. Banana.

249
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,760
 - So good.

250
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,600
 - I mean, that kind of--

251
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,600
 - If you said that just a bit faster,

252
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,120
 you would have been a mighty drill artist, I would say.

253
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,120
 (laughing)

254
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,960
 - Can I tell you an example of maybe

255
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,640
 the coolest detective ever?

256
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,600
 - Oh, okay.

257
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,600
 - Have you ever heard of the Roman emperor Tiberius?

258
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,440
 - Yes.

259
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,160
 - He once solved a crime by,

260
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,960
 he turned detective in ancient Rome.

261
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,800
 - Okay.

262
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,840
 - I just love this so much.

263
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,600
 There was this woman called Apronia, who was murdered.

264
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,760
 Well, she fell from a high window and died.

265
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,720
 And she was the wife of a praetor,

266
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,200
 a very senior official called Sylvanus.

267
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,360
 She was the daughter of a really senior general

268
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,240
 in ancient Rome called Apronius.

269
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,160
 She was Apronia.

270
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,920
 So she was a very significant young woman

271
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,560
 and very powerfully connected.

272
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,680
 And her father thought,

273
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,480
 I don't believe she fell out of this window and died.

274
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,360
 I think she might've been pushed or thrown out of the window.

275
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,680
 And he took the matter to the emperor Tiberius.

276
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,320
 And Tiberius said, "I'm on the case."

277
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,160
 And then investigated--

278
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,000
 - Really?

279
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,280
 - Went to the crime scene, questioned people.

280
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,000
 This is a TV series begging to be made.

281
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,840
 - Yeah.

282
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,840
 - Stop pitching TV series.

283
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,000
 - He's a cop, but he's also the emperor of Rome.

284
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,720
 That's, yeah, I'm in.

285
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,960
 - Did he put on a Batman costume to conceal

286
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,240
 that he was in fact the emperor?

287
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,920
 - I just think this has hit written all over it.

288
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,760
 Like he's halfway through fingerprinting somewhere

289
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,600
 and someone comes up like,

290
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,520
 "Someone's invaded Gaul, what do we do?"

291
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,000
 And he's got, "Oh, he's got trouble at home as well."

292
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,080
 I just feel like this is a good series.

293
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,680
 - How did he solve it?

294
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,320
 - Well, I think he just decreed

295
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,880
 that the guy was guilty.

296
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,400
 (all laughing)

297
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,720
 - You're always gonna get your end in every episode.

298
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,160
 - How's he gonna solve this one?

299
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,000
 He hasn't.

300
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,720
 Okay, no worries.

301
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,880
 - But anyone else is waiting for a genius reveal there.

302
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,840
 - What's one more guy?

303
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,200
 - Yeah, exactly.

304
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,560
 - Supposedly he did things like this.

305
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,800
 Like he crops up in plenty of lot.

306
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,200
 Supposedly he investigated things like searches

307
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,600
 for sea monsters and things like this.

308
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,120
 He was interested in evidence and, you know,

309
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,160
 but he decided that on the balance of probabilities,

310
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,080
 Sylvanas was guilty, the husband, that is,

311
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,120
 and Sylvanas then had someone cut his wrists and he died.

312
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,520
 - Nice.

313
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,760
 Well done, Type-Rus.

314
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,000
 - You're a credit.

315
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,920
 - Can I just quickly,

316
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,760
 I know we're talking about the police now,

317
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,720
 can I tell you one more of these cannabis-related facts?

318
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,720
 - Oh, yeah.

319
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,320
 - Because the scams are developing

320
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,960
 that cannabis growers are using.

321
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,640
 I just find some of them unbelievable.

322
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,600
 And so last year, this happened,

323
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,440
 a guy from North London, he was called Charles Reeves.

324
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,240
 He'd been working abroad for a bit

325
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,280
 and he'd let his flat out, his family home,

326
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,880
 because he was going to be working overseas

327
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,680
 for some months, I think.

328
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,560
 He got back, he found, in his flat, can you guess?

329
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,440
 - A cannabis farm.

330
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,840
 - 10 tons of soil that he literally moved in.

331
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,720
 10 tons of soil to grow cannabis in,

332
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,000
 three feet deep on the floors.

333
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,840
 - Wow.

334
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,680
 - Imagine getting back to your home

335
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,400
 three feet deep in a soil, a flat.

336
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,840
 - You'd be so confused.

337
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,240
 Is this a weird earthquake or something?

338
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,880
 - Yeah, and there was obviously,

339
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,000
 there was cannabis growing everywhere

340
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,320
 and it had been abandoned

341
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,720
 because he'd been coming back to it.

342
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,560
 But they'd hacked into the electricity system

343
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,800
 to bypass the meter,

344
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,360
 'cause that's one of the other ways you catch cannabis farmers

345
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,720
 is they use a huge amount of electricity

346
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:58,080
 and so you spot unusual uses of electricity, basically.

347
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,080
 - Right, that's so funny.

348
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,400
 What does he do with it?

349
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,960
 Does he sipen a bit off the top?

350
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,800
 - I don't believe so.

351
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,800
 - He's obsessed with the siphoning off the top.

352
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,960
 - People have got to start siphoning.

353
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,120
 I hate waste.

354
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,680
 - Yeah.

355
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,720
 - What do you want to do after you've smoked a joint?

356
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,640
 You want to--

357
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,640
 - Report yourself immediately to the police,

358
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,520
 it's what I would do.

359
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,880
 But what, is there something else you want to do?

360
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,680
 - People want to eat a lot of food.

361
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,680
 - You want to binge on some cakes.

362
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,520
 - Cake, okay.

363
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,440
 - And this is just my way of segueing

364
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,840
 because have you guys heard of cake finds?

365
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,680
 - No.

366
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,280
 - This is a thing in the police force and they're huge.

367
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,680
 So these are, if you do something wrong in the police

368
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,280
 and it's big, like massive corruption

369
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,600
 or whatever you get in real trouble,

370
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,040
 if you do something wrong and it's small,

371
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,080
 you get a cake find.

372
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,560
 So examples of something that is a cake find

373
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,200
 is spraying a colleague in the face

374
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,760
 with incapacitant spray.

375
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,080
 - Oh, wow.

376
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,400
 - Filing a deceased report

377
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,280
 and putting your own name on it by accident.

378
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,200
 Someone did that, cake find.

379
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,000
 Falling through a roof while searching a suspect's house.

380
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,160
 These are all things that have caused cake finds

381
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,000
 to be issued.

382
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,320
 - I think you should be fine for that.

383
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,600
 - No, 'cause that, you could die, right?

384
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,440
 - Yeah.

385
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,360
 - That one, that feels, yeah.

386
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,160
 Oh, how soon is the fine levied on the person?

387
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,080
 Is it like while you're waiting for the ambulance

388
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,920
 to pick him up?

389
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,440
 - It's once they're out of the coma,

390
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,520
 I think you come up and gently say.

391
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,960
 - Is there a gradation of cake finds?

392
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,560
 Is it like we want something with three tiers,

393
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,560
 like we want icing in between all the tiers

394
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,880
 and we want some ruffles on the top?

395
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,240
 - Maybe, but it's all decided on by the cake legislator

396
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,760
 who's consulted on social media by any police force.

397
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,040
 If you go to the cake legislator on Twitter,

398
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,240
 then they'll have a policeman saying,

399
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,440
 look, my colleague dropped the police car keys in the drain.

400
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,480
 What does he get?

401
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,840
 And the cake legislator will say,

402
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,200
 that's a Krispy Kreme tray.

403
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,120
 - Sorry, this is an account on Twitter,

404
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,280
 which is, is it a real police officer behind this?

405
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,560
 - Yeah, no one knows who it is,

406
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,880
 but I think it was the telegraph

407
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,840
 who interviewed them by email.

408
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,600
 - But we believe they're a real police officer.

409
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,720
 - God, is it just a kid pissing about

410
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,200
 and the whole police force is just asking for it?

411
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,440
 - But I like that, I like the mystery.

412
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,280
 - Can I say one more thing?

413
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,560
 Just one last thing before we move on.

414
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,960
 This definitely would have resulted

415
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,040
 in a lot of cake being brought to the police station.

416
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:04,880
 This happened last year.

417
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,680
 The UK's police and crime minister,

418
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,280
 Dame Diana Johnson, had her purse stolen.

419
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,520
 Her purse was stolen at an annual conference

420
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,080
 for senior police officers,

421
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,360
 where she was giving a speech on the current epidemic

422
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,920
 of theft and shoplifting in the UK.

423
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,080
 - Love this stuff.

424
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,660
 (upbeat music)

425
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:25,680
 - Okay, it's time for fact number two.

426
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,840
 And that is my fact.

427
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,960
 My fact this week is that in France,

428
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,400
 there are some cars that are so tiny

429
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,280
 that you don't even need a driver's license to drive them.

430
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,600
 - Is this 'cause we all know you've had trouble

431
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,160
 getting a driving license?

432
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,560
 - I think that's the answer.

433
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,720
 - I honestly, we was trying to look at shortcuts

434
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,480
 of how do you get a license quicker.

435
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,840
 And is that how you found this?

436
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,000
 - Yeah, this is how this came up.

437
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,360
 It was in France, you can get it as quick as seven hours.

438
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,880
 Now this is not technically a real driving license

439
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,480
 because it's not a license at all.

440
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,560
 What this is, is if you don't mind not being in a real car,

441
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,120
 going at a real speed,

442
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,360
 but instead are happy to sit in a two-seater tiny car

443
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,680
 going at a really slow pace, then this is what you can do.

444
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,640
 - They're called "voitures sans permis", aren't they?

445
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,240
 Literally a car without a license.

446
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,080
 - Exactly.

447
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,840
 - And they're amazing to look at.

448
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,480
 They're not tiny, tiny, they're not like clown cars.

449
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,880
 - They are slow, slow, 20 miles an hour max.

450
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,280
 It's like a run fast, isn't it?

451
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,440
 - Yeah, they're also known as "voiturettes",

452
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,720
 literally little cars.

453
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,960
 But they're everywhere in France,

454
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,520
 and people have them and drive them around,

455
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,920
 and they change hands as well.

456
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,760
 So if someone loses their license,

457
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,720
 they will get a VSP as they're called,

458
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,720
 "voitures sans permis",

459
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,720
 and then as soon as they get their license back,

460
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,960
 maybe they'll pass that car on to someone else.

461
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,440
 - Well, this is, I mean, this is the amazing thing.

462
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,440
 You could lose your license

463
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,800
 because you've been drink driving or whatever reason,

464
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,560
 and you can literally get out of that car,

465
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,880
 go down to a dealership, buy a smaller car,

466
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,880
 and be back on the road instantly.

467
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,040
 - You're meant to do a few extra layers, aren't you?

468
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,120
 But I think in practice, often unofficially,

469
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,120
 they're just bored and sold.

470
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,920
 - Exactly, like in the back roads of rural France,

471
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,240
 no one's really checking that.

472
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,800
 - That's true.

473
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,080
 Do you know you don't need a driving license

474
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,480
 to be an F1 driver?

475
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,480
 - Get out.

476
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,400
 - Yeah, they changed the rules last year, actually.

477
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,520
 - They liberalised that.

478
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,680
 That's very against the grain of modern life, isn't it?

479
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,960
 Normally, they're tightening things up,

480
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,800
 saying, "Well, we've got to stop all this."

481
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,000
 - They thought we've gone too far

482
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 demanding people have a normal driving license

483
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,120
 to drive an F1 car.

484
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,120
 - Wasn't there a kid in Belgium who was an F1 driver?

485
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,400
 - So Kimmy Antonelli was the person

486
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,400
 for whom I think they might have changed the rules

487
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,360
 that last year, and he was 17 at the time,

488
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,560
 didn't have a driving license,

489
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,560
 but they wanted him to replace Lewis Hamilton,

490
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,800
 which he now has done,

491
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,800
 because Lewis Hamilton left Mercedes to go to Ferrari.

492
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,080
 So this guy, this 17-year-old guy,

493
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,160
 didn't have a license,

494
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,000
 and yeah, you now don't need one.

495
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,040
 You need to do other things,

496
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,480
 like prove you're amazing at winning driving races

497
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,960
 and be very good at karting or motorsports

498
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,920
 and things like that.

499
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,080
 But he, I mean, he did in fact end up

500
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,280
 passing his driving test at the start of this year,

501
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:57,360
 six weeks before competing in his first F1 race.

502
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,160
 - Wow. - But isn't that amazing?

503
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,000
 - That is amazing.

504
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,320
 I suppose they're kind of different skills,

505
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,840
 as in you're not as worried about traffic

506
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,880
 when you're doing Formula One.

507
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,120
 - It's like there's no indicating.

508
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,440
 - Is it a three-point turn?

509
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,640
 - Rarely roundabouts.

510
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,280
 (laughing)

511
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,080
 - Has she gone really off course?

512
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,160
 - Did they have a thing where they can

513
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,120
 just wee any time they like?

514
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,760
 - I think you can do that in your own car anyway.

515
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,600
 (laughing)

516
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,440
 - That's a good point.

517
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,280
 What are we thinking?

518
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,120
 I do that all the time on my own car.

519
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:21,960
 - Is that part of the test?

520
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,400
 Is that why I failed my last test?

521
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,240
 (laughing)

522
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,080
 - No.

523
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:25,920
 - I don't know if it's a number two.

524
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,760
 - Is it?

525
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,000
 (laughing)

526
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,520
 There's no, surely there's no rule.

527
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,080
 Like no one's thought of making that a rule

528
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:32,920
 in the driving test.

529
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,760
 - No one's thought of it.

530
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,600
 - I don't know why you've said it.

531
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,840
 Yeah, where, I think I assumed

532
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,440
 that Formula One drivers have to have

533
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,120
 a bottle to wean or something.

534
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:41,960
 - I can't remember what they do.

535
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,920
 - You think a Formula One driver,

536
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,400
 going at the speeds they're going at,

537
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,160
 are gonna pull out a Coke bottle

538
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,240
 and try pissing to it and mid-drive.

539
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,360
 That's what they have to do when they piss stop, don't they?

540
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,840
 That's why sometimes they take away the lollipop

541
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,400
 and the guy doesn't immediately drive off.

542
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,320
 It's 'cause he's just shaking.

543
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,560
 - He's just having a, wow.

544
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,520
 I never knew how actually skilled these guys were

545
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,080
 that they could manage to drive that while pissing.

546
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,600
 - A lot of the crashes are because

547
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,280
 they put their hand on the wrong thing.

548
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,520
 (laughing)

549
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,480
 - No, but surely drivers have only mid-race, don't they?

550
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,320
 - I think it's a good question

551
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,640
 'cause there are quite a long races on my car.

552
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,800
 - They're really long and they have to drink,

553
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,640
 they have to take in fluids.

554
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,640
 - But we don't know the answer.

555
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,160
 I think the truth is we don't know the answer here.

556
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,000
 - Yeah, I think you would,

557
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,120
 yeah, I don't think it'd be illegal.

558
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,840
 - I can tell you that if you're--

559
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,640
 - Just a very, very few races are lost

560
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,880
 because someone's having a shit in the foot well.

561
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,200
 I think that's fair.

562
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,240
 - Almost never happens.

563
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,680
 - There's no Paul O'Rike Cliff or Formula One racing.

564
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,040
 - Is the person you were talking about

565
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,440
 was his name Max Verstappen?

566
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,080
 - No, so no, I was talking about Kimmy Antonelli.

567
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,720
 Max Verstappen is the greatest driver ever

568
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,160
 of the last 10 years.

569
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,000
 - Belgian?

570
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,520
 - Yeah, he's won everything.

571
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,360
 - I thought he was Dutch.

572
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,960
 - Sorry, I've never heard of him before.

573
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,920
 He's a bunch of years ago, he was a 17 year old kid.

574
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,520
 - Years ago he was 17, yes.

575
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,360
 - Racing for the F1 didn't have an actual driver's license

576
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,480
 back in Belgium.

577
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,920
 So he could race the F1, but when he got back home,

578
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,080
 he needed an adult with a license sitting with him

579
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,840
 in the car while he was on his learners

580
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,680
 in order to drive.

581
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,440
 Yeah, so that was his two worlds.

582
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,760
 - That's so funny.

583
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,120
 - I can imagine it would be very hard

584
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,280
 to transfer between the two.

585
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,520
 - Yeah, and you do get in trouble

586
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,440
 if you drive like you're a Formula One driver

587
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,520
 on it through a town.

588
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,360
 - Exactly.

589
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,040
 - And rally driving, you can be banned.

590
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,760
 There was a rally driver called Colin McRae

591
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,240
 who was banned in the '90s,

592
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,400
 but he actually could get a license.

593
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,000
 And if you lose your license here,

594
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,560
 you can get a license to compete

595
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,760
 in competitive sports racing in another country.

596
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,200
 So he got a license in Monaco,

597
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,720
 even though he was banned for drink driving or speeding here.

598
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,560
 And then he came back,

599
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:39,120
 competed in rally driving races in Wales in 2002

600
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,320
 without a license.

601
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,760
 But rally driving is half public roads

602
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,600
 and half private roads,

603
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,840
 even though they shut them all.

604
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,160
 On the public roads,

605
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,480
 he had to swap with his co-driver

606
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,720
 'cause he didn't have a license

607
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,000
 to drive on public roads in the UK.

608
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,520
 - Do they have to stop and get out?

609
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,760
 - I can't find this out.

610
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,600
 If anyone watched it,

611
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,360
 I can't find out if they stop and they--

612
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,480
 - 'Cause that would slow you down enough

613
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,320
 to lose the race, I'm sure.

614
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,640
 - There's got to be a Batman style chair swap

615
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,680
 that can happen internally in the car

616
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,520
 that you build in.

617
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,120
 - Or one of those driving instructor cars

618
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,600
 which have dual controls.

619
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,400
 Yeah, but then you're driving on the wrong side of the car.

620
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,520
 You're suddenly in an English car in Europe.

621
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,360
 - Oh, that doesn't matter.

622
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,440
 Like a left and right hand drive.

623
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,520
 That's not going to make a big difference.

624
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,360
 - If you're a good driver,

625
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,840
 you thought you could handle that.

626
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,680
 - You'll find all this out

627
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,760
 when you have your first lesson down.

628
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,760
 Don't worry about it.

629
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,600
 You know, Norway,

630
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,200
 it is very, very, very electric in its cars, right?

631
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,520
 99% of new cars sales are electric.

632
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,160
 The reason this has happened is,

633
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,480
 in part, thanks to the band A-Ha.

634
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,560
 - A-Ha?

635
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,400
 - No, A-Ha.

636
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,320
 - A-Ha.

637
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,480
 (laughing)

638
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,440
 - We could dance this dance all day.

639
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,800
 I find this absolutely mad.

640
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,280
 This is an amazing story, right?

641
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,680
 They bought, I think, the first electric car in Norway,

642
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,880
 back in the '80s,

643
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,000
 when electric cars were really not a thing.

644
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,560
 They bought it at a conference in Switzerland.

645
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,200
 It was a converted Fiat Panda,

646
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,480
 which had been converted to run on batteries.

647
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,280
 And two of the guys from A-Ha,

648
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,760
 they just thought it was very cool.

649
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,080
 They drove it from the conference back to Norway.

650
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,040
 And when they got it back,

651
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:07,320
 they found there was no way of legally registering it

652
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,920
 because Norway's traffic ministry

653
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,560
 or whatever couldn't compute an electric car.

654
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,880
 And Norway has loads of toll roads, right?

655
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,600
 So they would drive it through the tolls,

656
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,720
 that they would be fined

657
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,920
 because they hadn't registered their car,

658
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,360
 but they couldn't register their car.

659
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,520
 So they'd get the fine.

660
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,440
 They wouldn't pay the fine.

661
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,200
 They kept driving through the toll roads.

662
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,920
 Eventually, the car was confiscated.

663
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,960
 It went to a police auction

664
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,200
 where they bought the car back

665
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,080
 because no one else wanted

666
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,200
 to convert it to electric Fiat Panda.

667
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,760
 They did this for several goes round

668
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,080
 on the car being confiscated, fined, re-bought, all of that.

669
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,320
 And eventually, the authorities just said,

670
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,080
 "Oh, fine, we'll just abolish road tolls

671
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,280
 "for electric cars."

672
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,720
 And that was a big incentive to lots of people

673
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,720
 to go electric.

674
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,040
 - No way! - Because we then don't pay

675
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,320
 the road tolls, yeah.

676
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,160
 - Great.

677
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,000
 - That's unbelievable.

678
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,840
 - Uh-huh.

679
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,720
 - Clever. - Isn't that stunning?

680
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,600
 - Clever band.

681
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,120
 And was that their plan all along?

682
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:54,960
 - That was the plan all along.

683
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,440
 - To solve the climate crisis.

684
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,800
 - How many points do you need

685
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,920
 on your license to lose your license?

686
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,760
 - 12.

687
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,840
 - 12, exactly.

688
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,520
 Okay, that's the case.

689
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,080
 If you get 12 points, you lose your license.

690
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:12,080
 Except there are some people who have more points than that

691
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,840
 and still haven't lost their license.

692
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,720
 'Cause you can get exemptions if, for example,

693
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,280
 you really need to drive to look after someone.

694
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,240
 If you're a carer, all that kind of thing.

695
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,400
 Or there's another urgent reason why you definitely need,

696
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,760
 and you can persuade the authorities

697
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,960
 that you need to keep driving.

698
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,160
 And I find this stunning.

699
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,480
 There are 10,000 people in the UK

700
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,640
 who have more than 12 points on their license

701
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,520
 and still have their license.

702
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,800
 There is one 26-year-old from North Wales

703
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:40,200
 who has, on his license, 229 points.

704
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,520
 - No, there's not.

705
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,760
 - Yes. - And can still drive.

706
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,440
 - And still has a license.

707
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,880
 I can't work it out fully.

708
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,160
 But for example, if you speed,

709
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,440
 let's say a speed limit's been changed from 30 to 20,

710
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,600
 which happened in Wales and some bits of Wales recently,

711
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,000
 and you drive through several cameras in one day,

712
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,280
 you're technically speeding through all of them.

713
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,560
 And let's say, 'cause the postal system's a bit slow,

714
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,760
 you're doing that for two weeks

715
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,680
 before the first thing catches up with you.

716
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,200
 - What a terrible thing to do on your doorstep.

717
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,760
 - Suddenly. - When you know.

718
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,320
 - Right, so like two weeks later, after commuting,

719
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,240
 let's say 20 miles each way and going 30 when, you know,

720
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,400
 the limit's suddenly 20,

721
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,560
 you're doing 150% of the speed limit.

722
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,120
 Yeah, so for whatever reason.

723
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,280
 - That's a slow post, though,

724
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,440
 if he's racked up 220 points before he got the first letter.

725
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,400
 - Yeah, but if every camera that you speed through

726
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,840
 is three points, I can see it working out.

727
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,680
 - I could just have a rack up.

728
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,800
 My mum drove with 14 points on her license

729
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,960
 for a couple of years.

730
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,800
 - Oh, yeah?

731
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,320
 - Yep, the way she got away with it

732
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,880
 was when she should have lost her license.

733
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,200
 And I'm not saying this wasn't justified.

734
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,200
 Her lawyer argued that the school run

735
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,280
 was a very important time to bond with her children.

736
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,160
 - Oh my God. - And she would look

737
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:50,600
 at his house on very important parent-child relationships.

738
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,760
 - Are they serious?

739
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,000
 - Yes, she was then banned properly two years later

740
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,160
 when she was caught again, but yeah.

741
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,040
 We got that extra two years of parent-child bonding

742
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,400
 and I thought that was very important.

743
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,200
 - She gets your names mixed up all the time.

744
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,440
 (laughing)

745
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,600
 - That's not true, Judith.

746
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,200
 - Wow, I'm a huge fan of yours.

747
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,780
 (upbeat music)

748
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:13,400
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

749
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,720
 and that is Andy.

750
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,280
 - My fact is that under their main tongue,

751
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,720
 lemurs have another tongue.

752
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,920
 (laughing)

753
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,760
 - Sexy.

754
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,520
 - Lemurs have two tongues, yeah, sexy.

755
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,360
 - Yeah? - Sexy stuff.

756
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,200
 - That's cool.

757
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,960
 - And this second tongue is just for guessing.

758
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,500
 No, it's sadly not.

759
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,040
 It's a cleaning structure.

760
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,880
 But it's still a second tongue, it's called a sublingua.

761
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,640
 So they have to think of a tooth comb,

762
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,160
 which is this structure, I mean,

763
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,280
 it's exactly as it sounds.

764
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,160
 It's a group of teeth that look like a comb, fine.

765
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,800
 And they use that for grooming,

766
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:45,040
 so they run that tooth comb across their fur,

767
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,600
 and it helps to pick out all the-

768
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,440
 - And this is in the mouth.

769
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,320
 - This is in the mouth, yeah.

770
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,840
 But this tooth comb, like a normal comb, gets full of air.

771
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,680
 - Yep.

772
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,600
 - So how do you clean the comb?

773
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,720
 You do it with your second tongue.

774
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,600
 - It's a sublingua, which is an undertongue,

775
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,560
 and it's specifically for cleaning out the tooth comb.

776
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,640
 I don't know what they use to clean the tongue.

777
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,800
 - Oh, yeah.

778
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,640
 Hang on, does this mean that

779
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,200
 do they have to get the undertongue up

780
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,480
 and over the first tongue to clean it?

781
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,320
 - No.

782
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,280
 - Or do they swivel around the top tongues?

783
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,560
 - No, they just sort of stick out their tongue.

784
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,520
 It doesn't look as much like a tongue

785
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,680
 as you and I are hoping.

786
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,720
 It's a small and slightly harder,

787
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,240
 like a more pointy structure.

788
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,880
 But it is a sublingua.

789
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,960
 - Are there many sublinguas in the natural world?

790
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,640
 I couldn't really find many animals

791
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,000
 that have more than one tongue.

792
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,360
 - I'd be surprised just because lemurs are so weird

793
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,800
 because they're on Madagascar,

794
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,800
 and Madagascar is evolutionarily really quite separate,

795
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,880
 because it's split off from Africa

796
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,120
 and then from the Asian subcontinent.

797
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,080
 90 million years ago, 180 million years,

798
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:47,920
 it split from Africa.

799
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,640
 Then 90 million years later, India left,

800
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,720
 and it's just, Madagascar's just left there

801
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,440
 hanging out for weird stuff to evolve.

802
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,280
 - So that's amazing,

803
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,880
 because it's something like 80% of the animals

804
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,240
 that live there are just there,

805
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,120
 nowhere else in the world, right?

806
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,920
 - So lemurs, they all live in Madagascar.

807
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,120
 Well, they're all from Madagascar anyway.

808
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:05,960
 - From, yeah.

809
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,000
 - I was recently on a visit to an animal park in Kent,

810
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,080
 which was not in Madagascar,

811
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,080
 but they did have lemurs, and it was amazing.

812
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:11,920
 They're so cool.

813
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,840
 There are more than 100 species,

814
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,720
 and they're all native to Madagascar,

815
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,360
 and I'm sure we'll get into it.

816
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,360
 They're really endangered

817
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,520
 because of mostly habitat loss

818
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,480
 with a bit of climate change

819
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,080
 and also human hunting thrown in.

820
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,520
 So many of them are really threatened,

821
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,080
 but they're absolutely unbelievable creatures.

822
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:26,920
 They're so cool.

823
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,000
 - They are, and every single one of them

824
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,640
 seems to have their own unique thing

825
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,440
 that's interesting about them.

826
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,040
 We've spoken about this before on the podcast,

827
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,640
 but a few of them are quite solitary animals.

828
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,000
 So even within their family,

829
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,280
 they will barely see each other.

830
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,280
 And the only way they have any kind of communication

831
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,680
 with each other is by having a pissing tree.

832
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,320
 So they will go down at different times.

833
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,200
 It's like if you live in a big house

834
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,600
 with a lot of siblings and there's one toilet.

835
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,040
 You know, it's like eight, 15 in the morning,

836
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,320
 that's my slot.

837
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,520
 So they go at different times and they will pee,

838
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,760
 and they have a unique fingerprint, as it were,

839
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,280
 with their urine, which means that if I was going,

840
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,040
 I'd be like, "Handy's been, okay, I can smell."

841
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,000
 - And what does that tell you

842
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,280
 about what you're gonna do next?

843
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,720
 Is that like, oh, he must be near Biogo to see him,

844
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,080
 or quite kind? - It means they're okay.

845
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,000
 It's like a checking in.

846
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,880
 It's just like sending a WhatsApp to say,

847
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,720
 "Hey, hope you're well."

848
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,240
 It's like, "Oh, I know they're doing okay."

849
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,480
 - But they just never wanna pee at the same time together.

850
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,240
 - No, they don't wanna see each other.

851
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,880
 - They have no interest. - That's very nice.

852
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,080
 I personally like to have the bathroom to myself as well.

853
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,520
 I'm funny in an old-fashioned like that, but...

854
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,960
 - I invite the family.

855
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:34,040
 Lemurs, yeah, lemurs very weird.

856
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:37,800
 Ring-tailed lemurs, the sort of big ones, the famous ones,

857
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,760
 and they make their own perfume.

858
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:44,120
 So it's not just about secreting one scent.

859
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:48,080
 They secrete, apparently, a strong but short-lived scent

860
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:48,920
 in their wrists.

861
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:52,440
 So, you know, odor-toilet doesn't last very long.

862
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,280
 - Okay.

863
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,800
 - So there's like an odor-toilet in their wrists,

864
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,400
 and then they secrete a very long-lasting different scent

865
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,960
 from their shoulder glands, like an odor-parfum.

866
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,320
 And then they get their tails, and they dab their shoulders,

867
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,880
 and they dab their wrists to mix the scents together

868
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,640
 in what's known as a wrist-to-pit move in zoology.

869
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,280
 And then they've got a perfume,

870
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,880
 and then they waft it in the air.

871
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,720
 - The tail?

872
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,680
 - They waft their tail in the air.

873
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,520
 Now they've mixed up the perfume.

874
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,240
 - And that's their mating ritual,

875
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,800
 or is that just general day-to-day?

876
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,760
 - It's mating, and it's so clever, because it's telling,

877
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,760
 I mean, I can't believe,

878
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,880
 sometimes I wonder if I'm making this up,

879
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,200
 but it's telling females their genetic makeup,

880
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,800
 and the females smell it, and they know

881
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,840
 if the male is too similar to them,

882
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,360
 'cause obviously you want maximum genetic diversity

883
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,480
 for your kids, so you sniff their perfume,

884
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,040
 and it's like, "I also use Chanel."

885
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:41,880
 - Get out.

886
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,480
 - Then you're going to shag someone else.

887
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,720
 - I don't suppose, at any point,

888
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,920
 you read about the northern giant mouse lemur.

889
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,760
 - No.

890
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:55,280
 - Okay, this is another standout in the lemur tribe.

891
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:59,160
 They've got testicles, which are the largest,

892
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:02,400
 I believe, of any primate relative to body size.

893
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,400
 - Okay.

894
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,400
 - As a percentage, then,

895
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,840
 what would you say your testicles are of your body weight?

896
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,840
 - That's a very personal question, isn't it?

897
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,680
 - That's so personal.

898
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,080
 - He's just had mumps.

899
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,600
 (laughing)

900
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,440
 - Of my weight, what percentage?

901
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,760
 - I'm not asking you to give away your weight.

902
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,480
 I'm saying what proportion of your body weight is testicles.

903
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,000
 - We're talking 15%.

904
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,760
 (laughing)

905
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,080
 - Yeah, you do need to.

906
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,200
 - Dream on, mate.

907
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,040
 For them, it's--

908
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,520
 - What were yours to put into context?

909
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,360
 - Sorry?

910
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,200
 - What are yours?

911
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,480
 - I don't, I think for humans, it's kind of 0.2%.

912
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,760
 No, it's less than, it's much less than 1%, you know?

913
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,240
 But for these guys, it's 5% of their body weight

914
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,080
 is testicles.

915
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:40,920
 - Wow.

916
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,320
 - It's the equivalent of me,

917
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,320
 and here's a fun home maths challenge,

918
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,160
 you can work out how much I weigh,

919
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,440
 it's the equivalent of me having testicles

920
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,400
 that are 3.8 kilos between them.

921
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,240
 - Right.

922
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,060
 - It's a lot.

923
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:51,900
 - Yeah.

924
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,740
 - It's a lot.

925
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,440
 And they were only discovered in 2005, these things.

926
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,120
 And often, as they swing through the trees,

927
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,800
 they will bump and bruise their testicles.

928
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,140
 - Oh, that's a nice one.

929
00:29:59,140 --> 00:29:59,980
 - That's right.

930
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,840
 - Oh, I've seen, my friend used to have a sausage dog

931
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,760
 called Dave, and Dave lived upstairs in a flat,

932
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,800
 and he had the longest dangling balls,

933
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,120
 and this poor dog, we used to walk behind him on the stairs.

934
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,400
 They would wallop the top of each step

935
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,240
 as they were going on.

936
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,000
 - I just see these dangling bells.

937
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,920
 - Does he mind it?

938
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,840
 Is it like every time he's going?

939
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,080
 - So Blue, who owned Dave, would show people,

940
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,360
 because he would say it's okay,

941
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,000
 and he would flip Dave upside down and say,

942
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,080
 "Look how hardened and leathery they've become,

943
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,560
 "they're okay, he doesn't feel it anymore,

944
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,840
 "it's like a real hard boxing bag now."

945
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,960
 - That's what you want.

946
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,080
 - But that's like so I can empathize.

947
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,840
 But maybe they've got very leathery hardened testicles.

948
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,880
 - Maybe, let's hope.

949
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,120
 But it's because they have a system

950
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,520
 where everyone has multiple partners,

951
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,160
 male and female, and there's no mating season.

952
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,640
 So they just need as much sperm as possible.

953
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,240
 - They have to produce a lot of sperm and frequently mate,

954
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,040
 and that's the way they pass their genes on.

955
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,920
 It's a very competitive field.

956
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:54,000
 - See, I guess a few of the lemurs have this kind of problem

957
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,760
 where there's just one feature of them

958
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,320
 that is just oddly grown, so that it suits the environment.

959
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,840
 The I.I., which is probably the most famous

960
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,320
 of the lemurs.

961
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,640
 - That Norwegian band.

962
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,900
 (laughing)

963
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,400
 - What?

964
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,160
 (laughing)

965
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:16,320
 - Yeah, they're a tribute band, uh-huh, I.I.

966
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,480
 They're a nautically themed uh-huh tribute band.

967
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:24,400
 - So the I.I. has a tremendously long finger.

968
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,920
 It uses the finger to get into trees and pick out grubs.

969
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,400
 So like how hummingbirds will have a long nose

970
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,080
 to suck like a straw, the I.I. uses its finger.

971
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,160
 Its finger though is so long, it has the same thing

972
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,440
 as it's walking along, it has to raise it up.

973
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,920
 Otherwise, it basically trips on its own finger

974
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,800
 as it's going along, and it's very delicate.

975
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,760
 So, you know, it could sprain the finger,

976
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,720
 or it could do major damage to it.

977
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,080
 - I hadn't thought about that, 'cause it is,

978
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,480
 it looks like E.T., the I.I.,

979
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,120
 with that ridiculously long middle finger.

980
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,520
 So it's about the size of a house cat,

981
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,560
 but its middle finger is eight centimeters long.

982
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,600
 So imagine a house cat, but with an eight centimeter long

983
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,560
 middle finger, and yeah, 'cause you see,

984
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,240
 when you see people who've got really good manicures,

985
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,760
 I always think, how on earth do you get anything done?

986
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,600
 But they, the whole time, must struggle.

987
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,960
 But what's amazing about them is that they're only primates

988
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,920
 that echolocate, and the way they do it

989
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,880
 is by tapping on trees.

990
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,360
 I kind of think this is cheating.

991
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,240
 Basically, they tap on trees like woodpeckers

992
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,720
 until they find a hollow bit, and then the hollow bit

993
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,360
 tells them that that's the place where bugs

994
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,720
 are probably living in when they eat it.

995
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,000
 - Oh, I thought you said cheating?

996
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,840
 - Yeah.

997
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,640
 - Well, it's easier to tap on a wall

998
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,960
 until you find a hollow bit, rather than--

999
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,840
 - To frown and to go, mew, do you mean that kind of thing?

1000
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:36,440
 - I thought you meant like, just like, anyone, anyone in?

1001
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,240
 - Like the wolf at the little pig's door.

1002
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,080
 - Yeah, exactly.

1003
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,920
 - "Let me in, little bugs."

1004
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,400
 I just think it's not as impressive as bats

1005
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,160
 who can navigate all around the world,

1006
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,080
 and they're just tapping on a tree to find the bug.

1007
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,320
 - To learn that, though, is pretty,

1008
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,880
 they're the only ones that do that as well.

1009
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,360
 - I think that's the thing about lemurs,

1010
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,680
 is that they're all very well adapted

1011
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,040
 to the areas they find themselves in,

1012
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,760
 and they have also filled all the ecological niches

1013
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,840
 that might be filled by other animals.

1014
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,320
 So you were saying the I.I. fills a roll

1015
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,760
 that might be taken by a hummingbird.

1016
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,840
 Well, you know, so on Madagascar,

1017
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,880
 every biological function that might fit into a food web,

1018
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,960
 a lot of them are filled by different species of lemur,

1019
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,800
 who are really, really well adapted to do that.

1020
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,360
 But obviously, when the environment changes,

1021
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,800
 or when the habitat is lost, they really struggle,

1022
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,120
 because they're adapted for one specific environment.

1023
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,080
 - Yeah, yeah, it is wild.

1024
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,080
 Lemurs, what does that mean?

1025
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,160
 Lemur?

1026
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,000
 - Lemur.

1027
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,560
 - Lemur.

1028
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,400
 - I think I know the answer.

1029
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,240
 It's Latin.

1030
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,200
 - Oh.

1031
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,640
 - For ghost.

1032
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,960
 - Okay, hear me out.

1033
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,120
 Emperor Tiberius has his toughest case yet.

1034
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,480
 (laughing)

1035
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,320
 It's a ghost.

1036
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,680
 - Something's been tapping my trees.

1037
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,160
 - So he just hangs a bunch of lemurs.

1038
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,000
 We move on.

1039
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,840
 Next episode.

1040
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,840
 - Yeah, they're called ghosts.

1041
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,400
 And then Linnaeus is the one who applied it to the lemurs,

1042
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,640
 because he thought their faces looked so ghostly.

1043
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,720
 And so they are the ghosts of Madagascar.

1044
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,840
 - Do you know what else means ghosts in the animal world?

1045
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,520
 - Weirdly, it's larvae, which I didn't know.

1046
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,360
 - Lavae.

1047
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:06,520
 - So lemurais and larvae are basically the same cluster

1048
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,360
 of things in Latin.

1049
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,760
 In ancient Rome, they were the two types

1050
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,040
 of evil ghosts you'd get.

1051
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:10,880
 Isn't that weird?

1052
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,200
 - Wow.

1053
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,880
 - Yeah, we do a bit of vilifying humans for hunting them,

1054
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,200
 or I find in some of the naturalist writing,

1055
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,720
 there's some vilifying humans for hunting them,

1056
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,840
 which I think is completely insane,

1057
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:25,120
 because 40 to 50% of people in Madagascar are malnourished,

1058
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,120
 which is pretty extraordinary.

1059
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,320
 - And also the early humans did not know

1060
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,040
 they were doing this, I don't know.

1061
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,760
 - They didn't know that, but yeah, but today,

1062
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,240
 like they're still hunted and eaten a lot today,

1063
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,920
 and that's one of the things that's putting them in danger.

1064
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,600
 And it's because over half of households in Madagascar

1065
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,680
 have understandably eaten lemur meat in the last year,

1066
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,360
 'cause that's the meat that's available,

1067
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,800
 and half of them are malnourished.

1068
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,920
 But there is this cool project,

1069
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,520
 which is the bacon bug project,

1070
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,760
 which is to farm succondry,

1071
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,800
 which are these still very cute little bugs

1072
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,120
 that have long, pink, trunk things on their noses

1073
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,880
 and like little furry backsides,

1074
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,080
 but they are delicious, tastes like bacon when fried,

1075
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,600
 and they've started farming them.

1076
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,760
 And in the pilot community where they've started farming them,

1077
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,000
 over the last three years,

1078
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,800
 they've reduced lemur hunting by 50%.

1079
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,120
 - Wow, that's great. - Which is pretty strong.

1080
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:14,960
 - Yeah.

1081
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,320
 - Can I give you one last lemur?

1082
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,160
 Yeah.

1083
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,680
 This is the red-fronted lemur,

1084
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,200
 and it does something pretty relatable.

1085
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,400
 It chews up poisonous millipedes.

1086
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,520
 That's not the relatable bit.

1087
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,080
 Actually, none of this is relatable.

1088
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,600
 It rubs the resulting goo on its genitals.

1089
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,400
 I said it wasn't relatable.

1090
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,760
 - No, no, keep going, this is my weekend.

1091
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,760
 - But it's so cool.

1092
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,680
 It's because they have lots of parasites,

1093
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,400
 and these millipedes have toxic goo in them,

1094
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,640
 if you chew them right.

1095
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,360
 So they chew the millipedes up just enough

1096
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:46,040
 that they release this really toxic orange slime,

1097
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:49,040
 and then they slather it all over their genitals,

1098
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,560
 their perianal region, and their tail,

1099
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:55,400
 and that kills off the parasites

1100
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,240
 that have been preying on the lemur,

1101
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,080
 and then they swallow the millipede whole,

1102
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,000
 so it's a tasty snack as well as a--

1103
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,040
 - Interesting. - Lovely.

1104
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,280
 Perianal. - Perianal.

1105
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,160
 - Perianal cream.

1106
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,800
 - They need to work on the markers for that snack, don't they?

1107
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,360
 - It just sounds like something from Nando's.

1108
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,640
 - Perianal. - Perianal.

1109
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,280
 - Well, this is not lemon and herb.

1110
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,760
 This is spicy hot.

1111
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,040
 And it also seems to create a little bit of a euphoria

1112
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,720
 or a narcotic sensation among them.

1113
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,320
 They've been seen chilling out after they've partaken.

1114
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,160
 - Really? - Does it?

1115
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,960
 Well, you put peri-peri up your arse,

1116
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,760
 then you will sometimes get a bit of a hit.

1117
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,280
 - Oh, it's hard when you have that flag sticking out, isn't it?

1118
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:41,960
 - Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show,

1119
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,440
 and despite him being on holiday,

1120
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,200
 James has still sent in one for us to discuss,

1121
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,520
 so here it is, James.

1122
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:52,120
 - My fact this week is if you built a house

1123
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,040
 in a certain point of Italy,

1124
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:57,360
 you can live in 10 different towns at the same time.

1125
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:01,440
 Unfortunately, that point is in the middle of a volcano,

1126
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,000
 and I am currently at that volcano.

1127
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,960
 - Thanks, James. - Amazing stuff.

1128
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,440
 - We've never had an on-location fact.

1129
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,520
 - No. - James recorded this

1130
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,920
 at the place that the fact is about.

1131
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,000
 - Yeah, as he just said. - Yeah, I think he just mentioned.

1132
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,520
 - As he literally just said, just wanted to hammer it home.

1133
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,840
 - James is on a mountain now.

1134
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,200
 - He's not on a mountain, he's on an active volcano.

1135
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,960
 - No, not right now, 'cause this isn't live.

1136
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,360
 Sorry to ruin the illusion.

1137
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,480
 - Anna, where is your tradecraft?

1138
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,800
 Where is your stage ship?

1139
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,640
 - Sorry. - Huh?

1140
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,560
 - This is very cool though, isn't it?

1141
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,440
 So this is that the Italian province of Catania,

1142
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,720
 which is where Etna is,

1143
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,600
 is divided into municipalities,

1144
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,720
 and there are 10 municipalities,

1145
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,120
 and they all meet at the top of Etna.

1146
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,800
 And in fact, I think it's actually split at that peak

1147
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,880
 into 11 sections, 'cause one of the municipalities,

1148
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,440
 Bronte, scoops around and nicks two portions of it.

1149
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,760
 - Yeah, but basically it's 10, basically it's 10.

1150
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,720
 - No, I know, but Bronte gets two bites of the cherry,

1151
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,400
 and I think it's worth saying.

1152
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,560
 - Yeah, Mount Etna, I had never really read anything

1153
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,800
 about Mount Etna before.

1154
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,080
 I assumed it was a standard communal garden,

1155
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,040
 small volcano, it's a big volcano.

1156
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:09,880
 - It's a big one, yeah.

1157
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:13,040
 - It's two miles high from sea level.

1158
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,400
 - Yeah, yeah. - That's tall, it is.

1159
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,280
 - It's the original, it's the OG volcano.

1160
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,520
 - What, what do you mean?

1161
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,400
 - Well, Etna is where Vulcan lived,

1162
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,000
 so the god of the forge and iron smelting

1163
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,040
 and all that stuff, Vulcan lived in Etna,

1164
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,200
 and that's why volcanoes are called volcanoes.

1165
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,440
 It is the volcano. - Oh, my goodness.

1166
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,400
 And just quickly, we should say

1167
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,640
 about these 10 points that meet.

1168
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,320
 I mean, I gotta say, James, I don't understand this fact.

1169
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,280
 I don't know why you'd want to live

1170
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,880
 in 10 different towns at the same time.

1171
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,000
 Who you paying your council tax to?

1172
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 And so, I mean, I get that these 10 provinces

1173
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,160
 or principalities or towns, they all meet at the same point,

1174
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,480
 but Etna is a really confusing place

1175
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,280
 because it sounds like it's, you know,

1176
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,440
 it sounds like your child's drawing of a volcano,

1177
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,640
 which is two slopes on either side

1178
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,200
 and a crater in the middle.

1179
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,200
 And Etna isn't really like that.

1180
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,600
 There are dozens of craters, you know,

1181
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,680
 and like new ones open up all the time

1182
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,480
 'cause it keeps on exploding and erupting.

1183
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,600
 So I find that really interesting.

1184
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,200
 There are more than 200 craters on Etna.

1185
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,040
 - God, that's a lot, isn't it?

1186
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,040
 - I know, it's many, many miles around,

1187
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,600
 but these places are so cool.

1188
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:20,240
 So Randaco was trilingual until the 16th century,

1189
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,400
 which was Greek in one area, Latin in another,

1190
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,080
 and Lombard in a third.

1191
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,680
 - Is that one of the 10 areas?

1192
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,520
 - That's one of the 10 areas.

1193
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,600
 There is Bronte, as you mentioned, Anna,

1194
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,440
 which is, as we've said before,

1195
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,280
 is where Nelson was created Duke of,

1196
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,240
 Admiral Horatio Nelson was made Duke of Bronte,

1197
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,840
 and we think it's where the Bronte sisters, their dad,

1198
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:45,960
 he used to be called Bronte, and he renamed himself Bronte,

1199
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:49,160
 maybe after Nelson or maybe after this area.

1200
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,840
 - Which in itself is named after a cyclops, isn't it?

1201
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,960
 Who lived there?

1202
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,520
 So the Bronte's dad is named after the cyclops.

1203
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,560
 - And Charlotte Bronte being named after a cyclops

1204
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,320
 is just so weird.

1205
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,960
 - It's very cool, yeah.

1206
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,760
 But what's amazing is it is an active volcano.

1207
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,520
 So like James, you know, just very happily

1208
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,440
 took his family up there on an active volcano.

1209
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,400
 But it's not like it's just people going up

1210
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,560
 at their own risk.

1211
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,920
 The whole area is a tourist destination.

1212
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,240
 You've got vineyards at the bottom of it,

1213
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,440
 where if there was an eruption,

1214
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,120
 absolutely would be taken out by it.

1215
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,800
 - You gotta pick those grapes fast, haven't you?

1216
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,560
 It's the lava rolls towards you.

1217
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,840
 - Just pick the big ones.

1218
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,000
 Just pick the big ones.

1219
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,840
 - This is between November and March.

1220
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,800
 I think those are the months.

1221
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,800
 There's two ski resorts that open up.

1222
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,160
 You can go skiing on an active volcano.

1223
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,680
 It's wild, yeah.

1224
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:42,040
 - Sometimes people ski alongside the lava when it's erupted.

1225
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:42,880
 - Cool. - That's mad.

1226
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,720
 - Really? - Yeah.

1227
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,560
 - Like racing it down.

1228
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,920
 - Kind of, yeah, yeah.

1229
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,000
 - And people do, people are quite annoying.

1230
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,880
 And I think they've introduced legislation now

1231
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,440
 because they do go much too close.

1232
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,840
 You're supposed to only be a certain distance

1233
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,800
 from the lava flow.

1234
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,040
 And you do have people who kind of cook their sausages

1235
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,520
 on it and stuff.

1236
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,360
 - Look, this is Italy.

1237
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,560
 It's the land of Romans.

1238
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,840
 People will cook their sausages on lava, you know?

1239
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,680
 - It's not it.

1240
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,120
 And it doesn't kill.

1241
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,200
 It's incredible.

1242
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,040
 And given how famous it is, and it's the OG,

1243
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,760
 it's only killed 77 people confirmed in its entire history.

1244
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,000
 - Confirmed kills, it's not James Bond.

1245
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,920
 - It's got a tally inside its craters.

1246
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,400
 - Are you sure about that?

1247
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,440
 - Yeah, I think so.

1248
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,280
 There's this insane account from the big 1669 eruption

1249
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,200
 where reports of it that came out much later

1250
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,000
 said that 10 to 20,000 people had been killed.

1251
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,040
 And still you see it on places like history.com,

1252
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,280
 Sky History Channel, get your facts right,

1253
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,240
 saying 20,000 people were killed.

1254
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,160
 - We're turning into a name and shame podcast now.

1255
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,720
 - I'm afraid so.

1256
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,760
 Because there are people that you can't accuse someone

1257
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,600
 of killing 20,000 people.

1258
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,280
 - Tiberias could, Tiberias could and would.

1259
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:51,400
 In fact, he would probably be on the scene of this.

1260
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,480
 - You're absolutely right.

1261
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,640
 - Yeah, have them all killed.

1262
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,880
 - Blame the volcano.

1263
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,800
 - Can I check on it?

1264
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,640
 Did you say why it didn't actually kill 20,000 people

1265
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,960
 in 1669?

1266
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,560
 - I think it's, I actually don't know,

1267
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,720
 but I think it's mostly slow moving

1268
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,520
 and people just leave.

1269
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,560
 It absolutely destroyed the area.

1270
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,880
 It ruined it economically for hundreds of years.

1271
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,880
 And still it's much, much less fertile

1272
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,200
 because of that eruption.

1273
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,680
 So they didn't get off scot-free.

1274
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:19,640
 - 'Cause I assumed that it always made the land more fertile

1275
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,720
 'cause it sometimes does with things like,

1276
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,360
 you know, the reason there are vineyards there

1277
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:26,040
 is because the soil is so rich and volcanic.

1278
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,920
 But I guess sometimes also it's just a dead-end wasteland

1279
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:29,760
 that it leaves behind.

1280
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,560
 So a lot of the time it is good for the--

1281
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,040
 - It's a fine balance, isn't it?

1282
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,840
 Do you know you don't want to overdo the lava?

1283
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,680
 - Exactly.

1284
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:36,600
 That one, that explosion, by the way,

1285
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,160
 is also as far as we can tell,

1286
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,680
 the first historical recorded attempt

1287
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,600
 to divert the lava stream as it's coming down.

1288
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,600
 So there was a town, Katania, one of the 10,

1289
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,920
 and they dug trenches above the village

1290
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,640
 in order to divert the stream of lava

1291
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,640
 as it was coming down.

1292
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,600
 Yeah, I mean, but as far back as that.

1293
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,400
 - I think, I believe that their neighboring town

1294
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,560
 was quite pissed off, wasn't it?

1295
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,680
 - 'Cause it went into them.

1296
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,800
 - Well, they re-diverted it.

1297
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,040
 They put a blockage up and it went back to Katania.

1298
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,280
 - It's like, it's like that, guys.

1299
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,440
 - Classic, classic neighbor behavior.

1300
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,760
 - Yeah.

1301
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:07,600
 - It does sound amazing,

1302
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,800
 'cause to deal with a flow of lava

1303
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,360
 is pretty challenging, even with modern technology.

1304
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:17,360
 And when you're dealing with it with shovels and pickaxes,

1305
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,000
 dealing, like making a trench like that,

1306
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,400
 it's just incredibly impressive.

1307
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,440
 They were wrapped in wet sheepskins

1308
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,120
 to protect themselves from the heat.

1309
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,480
 It's just, it's really impressive.

1310
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,320
 - It's crazy.

1311
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,400
 - We give the past a hard time sometimes,

1312
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,160
 but sometimes people are impressive, you know?

1313
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,000
 - No, they were hardcore.

1314
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:30,840
 - Yeah.

1315
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:34,000
 - So if you were gonna say how tall is Mount Etna,

1316
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,960
 the answer changes over the years.

1317
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,600
 I find that wild with volcanoes,

1318
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,800
 but basically off the back of certain eruptions.

1319
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,320
 So if you ask that question in 1865,

1320
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,920
 it was 170 feet higher than it is now,

1321
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,120
 because with the eruptions comes collapses internally

1322
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,160
 and it sort of goes up and down in size.

1323
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,000
 - Really?

1324
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:52,840
 - Yeah.

1325
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:53,920
 - But sometimes the act of erupting means

1326
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,680
 that it leaves lava around the rim,

1327
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,080
 which hardens and then makes it taller.

1328
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:57,920
 - Exactly, right?

1329
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,240
 - But sometimes it just blows the whole top off

1330
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,600
 and then gets shorter again.

1331
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,120
 That'd be cool to solve a crime,

1332
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,480
 like with your national grid thing, Dan,

1333
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,440
 of like, but what height was Etna

1334
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,840
 at the time of the offense?

1335
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:07,680
 - Yes.

1336
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:11,680
 - As we say, Etna has erupted loads of times,

1337
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,960
 200 times in the last three and a half thousand years.

1338
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:15,800
 - It's good.

1339
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,080
 - Once every 17 years, it's a really good score.

1340
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:21,440
 I think the most recent was 2021 when it threw up

1341
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,080
 12,000 tons of ash onto a local town.

1342
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,440
 - And so what happens in that moment?

1343
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,560
 You're in a surrounding town.

1344
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,080
 Do you evacuate immediately?

1345
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:28,920
 - You get help.

1346
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,360
 - It's not like Vesuvius back in the day

1347
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:31,360
 where you had to guess,

1348
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,160
 these days, officials are there, aren't they?

1349
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,000
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1350
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,840
 A big government has taken over,

1351
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,560
 previously charming, like small government,

1352
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,920
 libertarian pastime of surviving volcanoes.

1353
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,520
 But the big thing they're scared of,

1354
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,680
 all the most terrifying prospect

1355
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,280
 is a flank eruption, apparently.

1356
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,680
 So if there's a lava fountain

1357
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:48,800
 that just goes up from the top,

1358
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,240
 again, classic volcano,

1359
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,600
 that is sometimes really bad, obviously.

1360
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,840
 But the worst thing is where the site just blows off.

1361
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,480
 And that's when you get a big river of lava

1362
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,320
 flowing down the side towards your town.

1363
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,160
 It's impossible.

1364
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,880
 - Right, okay.

1365
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:05,640
 - I found what I think is probably the greatest photo

1366
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:10,280
 of Mount Etna erupting, taken by a local, okay?

1367
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:13,720
 It was taken in 2013, November 8th,

1368
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:18,000
 and it was taken by a man called Luca Parmetana.

1369
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,760
 Luca Parmetana took it while he was in space

1370
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,600
 on board the International Space Station.

1371
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:23,520
 - Yes.

1372
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,360
 - Heading over it, it was erupting,

1373
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,160
 and he managed to get a photo.

1374
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,560
 And he's from Sicily.

1375
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:32,320
 So it's a perfect local to the area,

1376
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,120
 manages to get a space photo of it.

1377
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,840
 Luca Parmetana, he was the astronaut

1378
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:39,920
 who was almost the first person ever to drown in space.

1379
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:43,040
 If you remember, he was out on a spacewalk

1380
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:47,520
 and within his helmet, the water supply got loose

1381
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,920
 and the water started going into his helmet

1382
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,760
 and droplets went up his nostrils.

1383
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,240
 That's Luca Parmetana.

1384
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,080
 - A little bit less time adjusting your lens

1385
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:58,280
 and a little bit more time making sure your hood's done up.

1386
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,120
 Maybe Luca.

1387
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:00,440
 - There's always a critic, isn't there?

1388
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:02,240
 (laughing)

1389
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:05,400
 - That's an episode of Tiberius International Space.

1390
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,920
 - An astronaut drowns in space.

1391
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:09,760
 Tricky.

1392
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,080
 But did anyone here?

1393
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:11,920
 Doesn't matter.

1394
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,120
 Hang these six people for the crime.

1395
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:15,120
 See you next week.

1396
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:18,560
 - Of course, we're referring to it as a volcano,

1397
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,880
 and it's not definitely a volcano.

1398
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:21,720
 - Oh no.

1399
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:22,560
 - What?

1400
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,800
 - Are you kidding?

1401
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,640
 - This is according to a geologist

1402
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,560
 and he's called Carmelo Ferralito.

1403
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:30,640
 - Sounds legit.

1404
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:31,480
 - Exactly.

1405
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:34,280
 So he lives near it.

1406
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,400
 And so there's this confusion about it,

1407
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,240
 'cause it's always burping, very, very gassy.

1408
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,120
 It belches out more than seven million tons of steam

1409
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:45,440
 and CO2 and sulfur every year.

1410
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,680
 And everyone says that's 'cause of gas bubbles

1411
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,280
 that are released from the magma.

1412
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,280
 But Ferralito says that you'd need

1413
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:54,680
 about 10 times more lava to be coming out of it

1414
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,640
 to justify all those gas bubbles.

1415
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,760
 So where are they coming from?

1416
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,080
 So some people say,

1417
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:03,240
 ah, no, what's happening is a lot of the lava's coming out

1418
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,280
 and then going back into Etna.

1419
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,000
 And he says, if it was doing that,

1420
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,840
 Etna would be inflating like a child's balloon

1421
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:12,120
 every time it erupted, the lava's sinking back.

1422
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,920
 - Which it's not, I presume.

1423
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,560
 - It is not inflating like a balloon.

1424
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:18,440
 - So it's not a volcano?

1425
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:19,560
 - It's a hot spring.

1426
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,840
 And he says that--

1427
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,040
 - I would be so pissed off with my real estate agent

1428
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:27,760
 if I was sold the house next to a hot spring.

1429
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:30,400
 Only to find out it was an active volcano.

1430
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,480
 - You've already drawn up your star plan.

1431
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,200
 - They photographed it from the other side.

1432
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,000
 So you didn't see Etna as a background.

1433
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:37,880
 It was very clever.

1434
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:41,640
 And on the viewing they kept on cunningly misdirecting you.

1435
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,520
 I say, just come and have a look around here

1436
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:44,560
 at the garage.

1437
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:50,200
 I would say on that occasion, Dan, caveat emptor.

1438
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,040
 You know?

1439
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,800
 - This guy says that it can only be justified

1440
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:58,880
 by it being mostly water and CO2 and sulfur,

1441
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,320
 which makes up 70% of the volume that it's spewing out.

1442
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,680
 - I'm sorry, I'm sure he's really well qualified,

1443
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:05,960
 but it is a volcano, isn't it?

1444
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:08,880
 Because I've literally seen photos of it vomiting lava

1445
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,120
 over a wide area.

1446
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:12,720
 - You know, take it up with Carmelo.

1447
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,000
 - Carmelo, please.

1448
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,480
 - You've got to make an apias of somehow in this life.

1449
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:18,920
 - The town was completely demolished

1450
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,760
 by a local hot spring.

1451
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:21,600
 Was it?

1452
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:26,560
 - But everyone's skin was very smooth at the end of it.

1453
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:32,440
 - Okay, that's it.

1454
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:33,440
 That is all of our facts.

1455
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,960

 So we're playing Sheffield in July,

1479
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,880
 but in June, we're going to be in Belgium.

1480
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,960
 We are playing the Nerdland Festival.

1481
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,400
 We've done it twice now.

1482
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,240
 It's very exciting.

1483
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:24,200
 We're going to be back again.

1484
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,440
