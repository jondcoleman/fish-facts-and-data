00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:14.480
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.140
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.840
 a weekly podcast coming to you

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.800
 from the QI offices in Hoburn.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.040
 My name's Dan Schreiber.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.080
 It is a three-person podcast this week.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.520
 Well, James is away on holiday.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.820
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.000
 and once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.080
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.120
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.640
 Starting with fact number one, that is Anna.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.000
 - My fact this week is that Essex Police

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.600
 has a team of six officers trained to grow cannabis.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.520
 - What?

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.240
 - And that's, yeah, it's what you're funding

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.560
 with your taxpayer money. - My taxes.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.240
 Funding the old wacky-backy,

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.760
 absolutely being grown by the police.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.600
 - By the police. - And they don't--

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.440
 - It's outrageous.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.340
 - It's ridiculous, they don't even send you any.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.500
 - What's the deal?

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.100
 - Well, this is an interesting bit of British law anyway,

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.540
 which means that when the police make a big drug seizure,

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.500
 then they can work out what the value of the drugs

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.260
 would have been, and then claim that value

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.340
 back from the drug dealer's assets as like a disincentive.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.620
 So it's like, hey, you've got 100 grand worth of drugs,

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.420
 I'll take your 100 grand car, or whatever.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.260
 But they need to work out the value of the drugs.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.700
 The problem is, when they come to a cannabis farm

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.700
 and it's not fully grown yet,

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.740
 then they haven't matured yet,

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.440
 they don't have that concentrated THC

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.120
 that's what gives cannabis its potency,

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.960
 then the dealers can claim it was never gonna be

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.160
 very valuable, or it's actually all moldy,

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.000
 it wasn't gonna work.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 - So in court, the cheeky lawyers will jump in

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 and say, this was never gonna grow into anything,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.640
 so you can't take anything away.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.480
 - And it's actually discount November,

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.120
 so you have to take half off of that.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.680
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.960
 You've got a voucher, if you've got the cannabis club card.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.480
 - Just use the offer code, fish, and check out.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.300
 - So they grow it themselves, basically, right?

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.060
 To prove how much it's gonna be worth.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.660
 - Do they finish growing the whole crop?

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.780
 - Yeah, so at the moment, and this is just Essex Police,

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.500
 but I think other police forces are experimenting with it,

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.740
 they bust the farm and they take the plants

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.940
 and they put them in a special facility they have,

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.180
 and they nurture, grow, and dry the plants properly,

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.940
 and they've learned how to make it maximally profitable,

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.340
 just like the drug dealers would,

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.380
 assuming they're skilled cannabis growers,

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.140
 and then they work out how much it's worth,

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.900
 and then they burn it all.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.620
 - Yeah, okay, okay, good.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.580
 Not bit by bit, not joint by joint.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.860
 - Hey, in a series of small fires, yeah.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.160
 - You've got to think they siphon a tiny bit off,

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.300
 write in to podcast.qi.com, and we won't tell anyone.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.140
 - Oh, I'll cross you off.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.180
 If you're a bank copper, just look out.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.560
 - Don't tell Andy, fine.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.800
 - So they've recovered over 300 million pounds worth

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.260
 of what would be the trade for the cannabis

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.040
 over the last six years, and so they'll grow it,

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.080
 and they'll be like, okay, that on the street

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.040
 is worth 53,000 pounds, that's what you owe now.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.120
 - Wow. - Yeah.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.740
 - Because street value's a tricky thing, isn't it?

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.620
 'Cause obviously there's no price list you can look up,

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.620
 which is why I don't partake,

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.940
 because it's just too messy.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.660
 I want to know, you know,

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.340
 that you don't have any consumer rights.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.300
 - You'll get a text message with a picture of the price list.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.220
 - Oh, okay.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.660
 Your dealers are going to have laminated menus.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.140
 You're going to have-- - I can't.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.700
 - And which wines would you recommend with this skunk?

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.500
 I love, what I love about this fact is that

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.640
 it's this sort of like lateral thinking way of policing,

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.040
 which I find so interesting.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.920
 There's so many methods that are going on now

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.240
 that we just don't even necessarily know about.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.400
 Like for example, the police have been collaborating

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.120
 over the last 10 years with the national grid.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.280
 So the frequency of the electricity

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.600
 that is being sent out to every home in England,

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.920
 Scotland, Wales, it's typically about 50 hertz,

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.440
 and that's the frequency that is being picked up

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.600
 in the background of every audio recording.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.880
 If you're near a power source,

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.600
 that's going to be there as a low buzz.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.980
 So in this room right now, we have electrical sockets.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.540
 Every recording like this recording is picking up.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.820
 The Hertz noise, very softly in the background.

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.060
 Now, it's not always 50 hertz, there's fluctuations.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.820
 And that is because of the nature of supply and demand.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.060
 Like when people are watching TV

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.220
 and it gets the ad breaks and lots of kettles go on,

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.820
 there are small fluctuations that go on on the national grid.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.260
 And when that happens, it happens everywhere.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.300
 Which means if you're recording all of the national grid,

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.420
 you're going to have timestamps

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.180
 on all of these fluctuations.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.640
 So often now police, if they're in court

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.240
 and there's a recording of criminals

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.560
 that is being used, audio recording,

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.800
 and they say that never happened

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.400
 at this place at this time,

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.560
 they listen to the frequency in the background

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.920
 and they can match it to the exact time

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.080
 at the national grid, isn't that insane?

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.920
 Wow.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:38.760
 Isn't that nuts?

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:39.600
 And that's been used in court

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.160
 and that has busted people

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.680
 who have claimed that the recordings were manufactured.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.600
 And it didn't happen when it was said to happen.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.760
 Oh my God, so cover up your plug sockets,

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.600
 is what you're saying.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.840
 Do all your mugging by the trees.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.080
 Just be away from, and don't record it.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.280
 Don't worry, you're recording it.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.120
 Just don't record it.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.460
 Oh yeah, good point.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.800
 That's pretty good, isn't that stunning?

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.900
 So that's called electric network frequency

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.520
 and they've been doing it for 10 years now.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.360
 This makes my clever cop workaround thing

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.080
 look much less impressive.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.600
 But this is what I quite like recently.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.600
 Did you see the two undercover policemen

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.680
 who dressed up as Batman and Robin?

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.280
 Okay, no.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.680
 It's not as high-tech, but it worked.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.080
 It was Inspector Darren Watson

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.120
 and Police Constable Abdi Osman

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.720
 and they were patrolling around London

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.040
 and they're looking for scammers

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.680
 who were playing illegal rigged gambling games

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.520
 of tourists and getting loads of money off them.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.520
 But people knew their faces by then.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.520
 And so one of them said,

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.960
 "I just remembered I had Batman and Robin costumes

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.280
 "in my house, which could come in useful."

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.060
 And they dressed up and they're so bad.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.680
 So there's pictures of them arresting these guys

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.880
 that they've come up to.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.840
 And the guy dressed as Robin

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.280
 is wearing a beige bucket hat with his Robin.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.320
 And the bucket hat is the only thing

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.840
 that's concealing his face, actually.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.080
 So I don't know why he's wearing the full Robin gear.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.920
 He's wearing Robin gear.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.400
 - 'Cause I think if he was wearing a police officer's

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.800
 outfit but a beige bucket hat,

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.720
 the wrongs might still spot that.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.960
 - I suppose.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.280
 - But that's effective, isn't it?

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.120
 - It works.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.960
 - I think that's really good.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.160
 I mean, you don't know how many people

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.040
 are undercover officers.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.800
 Look around you, like all those living statues.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:14.640
 - Come on.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.480
 - Yeah.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.720
 - You're trying to tell me that not one of them is a fed.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.200
 Or who is a fake police officer the other way around?

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.560
 Someone pretending to be a police officer.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.400
 So there was a thing.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.360
 Remember the TV show, "The Bill" 2010 that ended?

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.800
 The police force basically had to buy all of the costumes

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.280
 off of the bill because they were real police costumes.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.120
 - Really?

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.960
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:33.800
 - And burn them.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.320
 - Weirdly, they handed them out

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.080
 and they were being worn by actual policemen.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.320
 So they reused the clothing of the bill, the TV show.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.840
 - They had so exciting for those clothes

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.160
 'cause that's like a promotion, isn't it?

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.000
 - Yeah.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.600
 - I do have this, now I've seen it in my head

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.880
 as quite nice relationship.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:49.960
 And I think no one else sees that.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.760
 But basically that very famous day

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.640
 of the last few years, drill music has become associated

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:55.640
 with gang crime.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:59.040
 And the lyrics of drill songs will reference people

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.800
 who've been murdered on the streets.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.440
 And like say, I'm going to get you to a rival gang.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.280
 - Would it say that kind of,

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.920
 even that kind of foul language is you?

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.080
 - I don't know if I go that far, but.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.520
 - Which one of us is going to just buckle

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.400
 and actually ask what drill is?

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.240
 - Not me.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.000
 - Okay, me, though, continue.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.720
 - Hang on, you guys don't listen to drill music

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:18.560
 in your spare time.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.240
 - Is that like heavy rap, right?

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.480
 In terms of like lyrically.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.720
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.760
 - I listen to road works,

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.000
 but that's because I'm really interested in infrastructure.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:26.840
 So, yeah.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.800
 - Yeah, that's exactly what I'm talking about.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.240
 You go on believing that that's what I'm referencing.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.720
 - Oh yeah, Silver Town Tunnel Classics.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:35.560
 Yeah, great.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.960
 Oh, Thames Tideway Tunnel.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.520
 Yeah, I'm digging it.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.520
 - Well, I really like the idea

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.640
 that you would join the police and misunderstand this,

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:45.880
 'cause in Manchester, basically,

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.480
 the police have been recruited to,

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.240
 and it's called the Excalibur Task Force,

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.160
 which is trying to stop knife crime,

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.840
 recruited to get lots of intelligence from drill music.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.080
 So, if you were employed by them,

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.320
 I guess you would go and eavesdrop on building sites.

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.960
 What you're meant to do is watch loads of YouTube videos

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:01.960
 and then pick up the names that are being dropped

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.800
 and figure out who's pissed off about what,

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.560
 'cause it's referencing real things.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:07.960
 - Oh, right, okay, right.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:08.800
 - It's like pre-crime,

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.720
 but the pre-crimes have maybe been turned into songs.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.080
 - Exactly.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.560
 And then just, yeah, so you know where to keep a watch out,

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.880
 but then the drill artists know the police are watching them,

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.840
 so then they'll reference the police in return.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:21.680
 So as long as they'll be like,

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:25.520
 "Oh, you Excalibur naughty boys spying on us."

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.080
 - Do they put out fake news as well?

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:27.920
 Do they say--

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:28.760
 - Well, they should, shouldn't they?

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.800
 - Yeah, we're gonna get Mr. Banana tonight

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:31.800
 down by the old co-op.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.920
 And actually, there is no Mr. Banana.

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:34.760
 - So good.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:35.600
 - I mean, that kind of--

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.600
 - If you said that just a bit faster,

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.120
 you would have been a mighty drill artist, I would say.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.120
 (laughing)

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.960
 - Can I tell you an example of maybe

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.640
 the coolest detective ever?

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:47.600
 - Oh, okay.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.600
 - Have you ever heard of the Roman emperor Tiberius?

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.440
 - Yes.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.160
 - He once solved a crime by,

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.960
 he turned detective in ancient Rome.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:57.800
 - Okay.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:58.840
 - I just love this so much.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:02.600
 There was this woman called Apronia, who was murdered.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.760
 Well, she fell from a high window and died.

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.720
 And she was the wife of a praetor,

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.200
 a very senior official called Sylvanus.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.360
 She was the daughter of a really senior general

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.240
 in ancient Rome called Apronius.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.160
 She was Apronia.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.920
 So she was a very significant young woman

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.560
 and very powerfully connected.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:21.680
 And her father thought,

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:23.480
 I don't believe she fell out of this window and died.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:26.360
 I think she might've been pushed or thrown out of the window.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.680
 And he took the matter to the emperor Tiberius.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:31.320
 And Tiberius said, "I'm on the case."

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.160
 And then investigated--

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.000
 - Really?

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.280
 - Went to the crime scene, questioned people.

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:40.000
 This is a TV series begging to be made.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:40.840
 - Yeah.

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:41.840
 - Stop pitching TV series.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:45.000
 - He's a cop, but he's also the emperor of Rome.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.720
 That's, yeah, I'm in.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.960
 - Did he put on a Batman costume to conceal

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.240
 that he was in fact the emperor?

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.920
 - I just think this has hit written all over it.

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.760
 Like he's halfway through fingerprinting somewhere

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:55.600
 and someone comes up like,

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.520
 "Someone's invaded Gaul, what do we do?"

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.000
 And he's got, "Oh, he's got trouble at home as well."

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.080
 I just feel like this is a good series.

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.680
 - How did he solve it?

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.320
 - Well, I think he just decreed

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.880
 that the guy was guilty.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.400
 (all laughing)

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.720
 - You're always gonna get your end in every episode.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.160
 - How's he gonna solve this one?

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:16.000
 He hasn't.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.720
 Okay, no worries.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.880
 - But anyone else is waiting for a genius reveal there.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:23.840
 - What's one more guy?

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.200
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.560
 - Supposedly he did things like this.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:27.800
 Like he crops up in plenty of lot.

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.200
 Supposedly he investigated things like searches

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.600
 for sea monsters and things like this.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.120
 He was interested in evidence and, you know,

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:37.160
 but he decided that on the balance of probabilities,

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.080
 Sylvanas was guilty, the husband, that is,

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:44.120
 and Sylvanas then had someone cut his wrists and he died.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.520
 - Nice.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.760
 Well done, Type-Rus.

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.000
 - You're a credit.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.920
 - Can I just quickly,

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:53.760
 I know we're talking about the police now,

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.720
 can I tell you one more of these cannabis-related facts?

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:57.720
 - Oh, yeah.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.320
 - Because the scams are developing

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.960
 that cannabis growers are using.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.640
 I just find some of them unbelievable.

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.600
 And so last year, this happened,

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.440
 a guy from North London, he was called Charles Reeves.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.240
 He'd been working abroad for a bit

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:12.280
 and he'd let his flat out, his family home,

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.880
 because he was going to be working overseas

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.680
 for some months, I think.

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:19.560
 He got back, he found, in his flat, can you guess?

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:20.440
 - A cannabis farm.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:23.840
 - 10 tons of soil that he literally moved in.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:27.720
 10 tons of soil to grow cannabis in,

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.000
 three feet deep on the floors.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:30.840
 - Wow.

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:31.680
 - Imagine getting back to your home

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:35.400
 three feet deep in a soil, a flat.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:36.840
 - You'd be so confused.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.240
 Is this a weird earthquake or something?

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.880
 - Yeah, and there was obviously,

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.000
 there was cannabis growing everywhere

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.320
 and it had been abandoned

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.720
 because he'd been coming back to it.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.560
 But they'd hacked into the electricity system

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:48.800
 to bypass the meter,

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.360
 'cause that's one of the other ways you catch cannabis farmers

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.720
 is they use a huge amount of electricity

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:58.080
 and so you spot unusual uses of electricity, basically.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.080
 - Right, that's so funny.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.400
 What does he do with it?

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.960
 Does he sipen a bit off the top?

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:03.800
 - I don't believe so.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:04.800
 - He's obsessed with the siphoning off the top.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:07.960
 - People have got to start siphoning.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.120
 I hate waste.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.680
 - Yeah.

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.720
 - What do you want to do after you've smoked a joint?

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:15.640
 You want to--

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.640
 - Report yourself immediately to the police,

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:18.520
 it's what I would do.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.880
 But what, is there something else you want to do?

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.680
 - People want to eat a lot of food.

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.680
 - You want to binge on some cakes.

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:25.520
 - Cake, okay.

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.440
 - And this is just my way of segueing

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.840
 because have you guys heard of cake finds?

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:30.680
 - No.

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:33.280
 - This is a thing in the police force and they're huge.

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.680
 So these are, if you do something wrong in the police

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.280
 and it's big, like massive corruption

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:38.600
 or whatever you get in real trouble,

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.040
 if you do something wrong and it's small,

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.080
 you get a cake find.

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:44.560
 So examples of something that is a cake find

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:46.200
 is spraying a colleague in the face

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.760
 with incapacitant spray.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.080
 - Oh, wow.

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.400
 - Filing a deceased report

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:52.280
 and putting your own name on it by accident.

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.200
 Someone did that, cake find.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.000
 Falling through a roof while searching a suspect's house.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.160
 These are all things that have caused cake finds

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:00.000
 to be issued.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.320
 - I think you should be fine for that.

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.600
 - No, 'cause that, you could die, right?

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.440
 - Yeah.

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.360
 - That one, that feels, yeah.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.160
 Oh, how soon is the fine levied on the person?

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.080
 Is it like while you're waiting for the ambulance

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:10.920
 to pick him up?

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.440
 - It's once they're out of the coma,

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.520
 I think you come up and gently say.

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:15.960
 - Is there a gradation of cake finds?

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.560
 Is it like we want something with three tiers,

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.560
 like we want icing in between all the tiers

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:21.880
 and we want some ruffles on the top?

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:25.240
 - Maybe, but it's all decided on by the cake legislator

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.760
 who's consulted on social media by any police force.

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:30.040
 If you go to the cake legislator on Twitter,

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.240
 then they'll have a policeman saying,

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:35.440
 look, my colleague dropped the police car keys in the drain.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.480
 What does he get?

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.840
 And the cake legislator will say,

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:39.200
 that's a Krispy Kreme tray.

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.120
 - Sorry, this is an account on Twitter,

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:44.280
 which is, is it a real police officer behind this?

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:45.560
 - Yeah, no one knows who it is,

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:46.880
 but I think it was the telegraph

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.840
 who interviewed them by email.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:50.600
 - But we believe they're a real police officer.

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.720
 - God, is it just a kid pissing about

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.200
 and the whole police force is just asking for it?

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.440
 - But I like that, I like the mystery.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.280
 - Can I say one more thing?

00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:59.560
 Just one last thing before we move on.

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:00.960
 This definitely would have resulted

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:04.040
 in a lot of cake being brought to the police station.

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:04.880
 This happened last year.

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.680
 The UK's police and crime minister,

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:09.280
 Dame Diana Johnson, had her purse stolen.

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:11.520
 Her purse was stolen at an annual conference

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.080
 for senior police officers,

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.360
 where she was giving a speech on the current epidemic

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.920
 of theft and shoplifting in the UK.

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:19.080
 - Love this stuff.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:21.660
 (upbeat music)

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:25.680
 - Okay, it's time for fact number two.

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:26.840
 And that is my fact.

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:28.960
 My fact this week is that in France,

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.400
 there are some cars that are so tiny

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:34.280
 that you don't even need a driver's license to drive them.

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.600
 - Is this 'cause we all know you've had trouble

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.160
 getting a driving license?

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.560
 - I think that's the answer.

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:41.720
 - I honestly, we was trying to look at shortcuts

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.480
 of how do you get a license quicker.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:44.840
 And is that how you found this?

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.000
 - Yeah, this is how this came up.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.360
 It was in France, you can get it as quick as seven hours.

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:52.880
 Now this is not technically a real driving license

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.480
 because it's not a license at all.

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:58.560
 What this is, is if you don't mind not being in a real car,

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.120
 going at a real speed,

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:03.360
 but instead are happy to sit in a two-seater tiny car

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.680
 going at a really slow pace, then this is what you can do.

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:08.640
 - They're called "voitures sans permis", aren't they?

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:10.240
 Literally a car without a license.

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.080
 - Exactly.

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:12.840
 - And they're amazing to look at.

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:15.480
 They're not tiny, tiny, they're not like clown cars.

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:19.880
 - They are slow, slow, 20 miles an hour max.

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:21.280
 It's like a run fast, isn't it?

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:23.440
 - Yeah, they're also known as "voiturettes",

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.720
 literally little cars.

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:26.960
 But they're everywhere in France,

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.520
 and people have them and drive them around,

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:29.920
 and they change hands as well.

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:31.760
 So if someone loses their license,

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:33.720
 they will get a VSP as they're called,

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:34.720
 "voitures sans permis",

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.720
 and then as soon as they get their license back,

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.960
 maybe they'll pass that car on to someone else.

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.440
 - Well, this is, I mean, this is the amazing thing.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.440
 You could lose your license

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.800
 because you've been drink driving or whatever reason,

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.560
 and you can literally get out of that car,

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.880
 go down to a dealership, buy a smaller car,

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.880
 and be back on the road instantly.

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:52.040
 - You're meant to do a few extra layers, aren't you?

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.120
 But I think in practice, often unofficially,

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.120
 they're just bored and sold.

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.920
 - Exactly, like in the back roads of rural France,

00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.240
 no one's really checking that.

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:00.800
 - That's true.

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:02.080
 Do you know you don't need a driving license

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.480
 to be an F1 driver?

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:04.480
 - Get out.

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.400
 - Yeah, they changed the rules last year, actually.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.520
 - They liberalised that.

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:10.680
 That's very against the grain of modern life, isn't it?

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:11.960
 Normally, they're tightening things up,

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:13.800
 saying, "Well, we've got to stop all this."

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.000
 - They thought we've gone too far

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
 demanding people have a normal driving license

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.120
 to drive an F1 car.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:21.120
 - Wasn't there a kid in Belgium who was an F1 driver?

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.400
 - So Kimmy Antonelli was the person

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.400
 for whom I think they might have changed the rules

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.360
 that last year, and he was 17 at the time,

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:29.560
 didn't have a driving license,

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:31.560
 but they wanted him to replace Lewis Hamilton,

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:32.800
 which he now has done,

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.800
 because Lewis Hamilton left Mercedes to go to Ferrari.

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:38.080
 So this guy, this 17-year-old guy,

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.160
 didn't have a license,

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.000
 and yeah, you now don't need one.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.040
 You need to do other things,

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:44.480
 like prove you're amazing at winning driving races

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:46.960
 and be very good at karting or motorsports

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:47.920
 and things like that.

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:51.080
 But he, I mean, he did in fact end up

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:53.280
 passing his driving test at the start of this year,

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:57.360
 six weeks before competing in his first F1 race.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:59.160
 - Wow. - But isn't that amazing?

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:00.000
 - That is amazing.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.320
 I suppose they're kind of different skills,

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:03.840
 as in you're not as worried about traffic

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:04.880
 when you're doing Formula One.

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.120
 - It's like there's no indicating.

00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:07.440
 - Is it a three-point turn?

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.640
 - Rarely roundabouts.

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:11.280
 (laughing)

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:13.080
 - Has she gone really off course?

00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:14.160
 - Did they have a thing where they can

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.120
 just wee any time they like?

00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:17.760
 - I think you can do that in your own car anyway.

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:18.600
 (laughing)

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:19.440
 - That's a good point.

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:20.280
 What are we thinking?

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:21.120
 I do that all the time on my own car.

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:21.960
 - Is that part of the test?

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:23.400
 Is that why I failed my last test?

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:24.240
 (laughing)

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.080
 - No.

00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:25.920
 - I don't know if it's a number two.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:26.760
 - Is it?

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:28.000
 (laughing)

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.520
 There's no, surely there's no rule.

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.080
 Like no one's thought of making that a rule

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:32.920
 in the driving test.

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:33.760
 - No one's thought of it.

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:34.600
 - I don't know why you've said it.

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:37.840
 Yeah, where, I think I assumed

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:39.440
 that Formula One drivers have to have

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.120
 a bottle to wean or something.

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:41.960
 - I can't remember what they do.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.920
 - You think a Formula One driver,

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:45.400
 going at the speeds they're going at,

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.160
 are gonna pull out a Coke bottle

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.240
 and try pissing to it and mid-drive.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.360
 That's what they have to do when they piss stop, don't they?

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.840
 That's why sometimes they take away the lollipop

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.400
 and the guy doesn't immediately drive off.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.320
 It's 'cause he's just shaking.

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:57.560
 - He's just having a, wow.

00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:59.520
 I never knew how actually skilled these guys were

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:02.080
 that they could manage to drive that while pissing.

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:03.600
 - A lot of the crashes are because

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.280
 they put their hand on the wrong thing.

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.520
 (laughing)

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:11.480
 - No, but surely drivers have only mid-race, don't they?

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:12.320
 - I think it's a good question

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.640
 'cause there are quite a long races on my car.

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:14.800
 - They're really long and they have to drink,

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:15.640
 they have to take in fluids.

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:16.640
 - But we don't know the answer.

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.160
 I think the truth is we don't know the answer here.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:19.000
 - Yeah, I think you would,

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.120
 yeah, I don't think it'd be illegal.

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:21.840
 - I can tell you that if you're--

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:25.640
 - Just a very, very few races are lost

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.880
 because someone's having a shit in the foot well.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:29.200
 I think that's fair.

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:30.240
 - Almost never happens.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:32.680
 - There's no Paul O'Rike Cliff or Formula One racing.

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:35.040
 - Is the person you were talking about

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:37.440
 was his name Max Verstappen?

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:40.080
 - No, so no, I was talking about Kimmy Antonelli.

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.720
 Max Verstappen is the greatest driver ever

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.160
 of the last 10 years.

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.000
 - Belgian?

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.520
 - Yeah, he's won everything.

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:47.360
 - I thought he was Dutch.

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:48.960
 - Sorry, I've never heard of him before.

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:51.920
 He's a bunch of years ago, he was a 17 year old kid.

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:53.520
 - Years ago he was 17, yes.

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:57.360
 - Racing for the F1 didn't have an actual driver's license

00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:58.480
 back in Belgium.

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.920
 So he could race the F1, but when he got back home,

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:03.080
 he needed an adult with a license sitting with him

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:04.840
 in the car while he was on his learners

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:05.680
 in order to drive.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.440
 Yeah, so that was his two worlds.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:08.760
 - That's so funny.

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.120
 - I can imagine it would be very hard

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:12.280
 to transfer between the two.

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:13.520
 - Yeah, and you do get in trouble

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.440
 if you drive like you're a Formula One driver

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:16.520
 on it through a town.

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:17.360
 - Exactly.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.040
 - And rally driving, you can be banned.

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.760
 There was a rally driver called Colin McRae

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.240
 who was banned in the '90s,

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:25.400
 but he actually could get a license.

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:27.000
 And if you lose your license here,

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.560
 you can get a license to compete

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.760
 in competitive sports racing in another country.

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.200
 So he got a license in Monaco,

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:34.720
 even though he was banned for drink driving or speeding here.

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:35.560
 And then he came back,

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:39.120
 competed in rally driving races in Wales in 2002

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.320
 without a license.

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.760
 But rally driving is half public roads

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:43.600
 and half private roads,

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:44.840
 even though they shut them all.

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:46.160
 On the public roads,

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.480
 he had to swap with his co-driver

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.720
 'cause he didn't have a license

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:52.000
 to drive on public roads in the UK.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.520
 - Do they have to stop and get out?

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:54.760
 - I can't find this out.

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:55.600
 If anyone watched it,

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.360
 I can't find out if they stop and they--

00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:58.480
 - 'Cause that would slow you down enough

00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:59.320
 to lose the race, I'm sure.

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:02.640
 - There's got to be a Batman style chair swap

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.680
 that can happen internally in the car

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:05.520
 that you build in.

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.120
 - Or one of those driving instructor cars

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:08.600
 which have dual controls.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.400
 Yeah, but then you're driving on the wrong side of the car.

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.520
 You're suddenly in an English car in Europe.

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:13.360
 - Oh, that doesn't matter.

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:14.440
 Like a left and right hand drive.

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:16.520
 That's not going to make a big difference.

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:17.360
 - If you're a good driver,

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:18.840
 you thought you could handle that.

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:19.680
 - You'll find all this out

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:20.760
 when you have your first lesson down.

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:21.760
 Don't worry about it.

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:23.600
 You know, Norway,

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:26.200
 it is very, very, very electric in its cars, right?

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:28.520
 99% of new cars sales are electric.

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:31.160
 The reason this has happened is,

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:34.480
 in part, thanks to the band A-Ha.

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:35.560
 - A-Ha?

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:36.400
 - No, A-Ha.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.320
 - A-Ha.

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.480
 (laughing)

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.440
 - We could dance this dance all day.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.800
 I find this absolutely mad.

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.280
 This is an amazing story, right?

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:48.680
 They bought, I think, the first electric car in Norway,

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:49.880
 back in the '80s,

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:52.000
 when electric cars were really not a thing.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.560
 They bought it at a conference in Switzerland.

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:55.200
 It was a converted Fiat Panda,

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.480
 which had been converted to run on batteries.

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:59.280
 And two of the guys from A-Ha,

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:00.760
 they just thought it was very cool.

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:03.080
 They drove it from the conference back to Norway.

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:04.040
 And when they got it back,

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:07.320
 they found there was no way of legally registering it

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:09.920
 because Norway's traffic ministry

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:12.560
 or whatever couldn't compute an electric car.

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:13.880
 And Norway has loads of toll roads, right?

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:16.600
 So they would drive it through the tolls,

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:17.720
 that they would be fined

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:18.920
 because they hadn't registered their car,

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:20.360
 but they couldn't register their car.

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:21.520
 So they'd get the fine.

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:22.440
 They wouldn't pay the fine.

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.200
 They kept driving through the toll roads.

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.920
 Eventually, the car was confiscated.

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:26.960
 It went to a police auction

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.200
 where they bought the car back

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:29.080
 because no one else wanted

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:31.200
 to convert it to electric Fiat Panda.

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.760
 They did this for several goes round

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:37.080
 on the car being confiscated, fined, re-bought, all of that.

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:38.320
 And eventually, the authorities just said,

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.080
 "Oh, fine, we'll just abolish road tolls

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:41.280
 "for electric cars."

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:43.720
 And that was a big incentive to lots of people

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:44.720
 to go electric.

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.040
 - No way! - Because we then don't pay

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:47.320
 the road tolls, yeah.

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:48.160
 - Great.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.000
 - That's unbelievable.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:49.840
 - Uh-huh.

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.720
 - Clever. - Isn't that stunning?

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:52.600
 - Clever band.

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.120
 And was that their plan all along?

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:54.960
 - That was the plan all along.

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.440
 - To solve the climate crisis.

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:59.800
 - How many points do you need

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:01.920
 on your license to lose your license?

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:02.760
 - 12.

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:03.840
 - 12, exactly.

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:05.520
 Okay, that's the case.

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:07.080
 If you get 12 points, you lose your license.

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:12.080
 Except there are some people who have more points than that

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:13.840
 and still haven't lost their license.

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:16.720
 'Cause you can get exemptions if, for example,

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:19.280
 you really need to drive to look after someone.

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:21.240
 If you're a carer, all that kind of thing.

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:23.400
 Or there's another urgent reason why you definitely need,

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:24.760
 and you can persuade the authorities

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:25.960
 that you need to keep driving.

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:27.160
 And I find this stunning.

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:28.480
 There are 10,000 people in the UK

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:30.640
 who have more than 12 points on their license

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:32.520
 and still have their license.

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:35.800
 There is one 26-year-old from North Wales

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:40.200
 who has, on his license, 229 points.

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.520
 - No, there's not.

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:42.760
 - Yes. - And can still drive.

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:44.440
 - And still has a license.

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:45.880
 I can't work it out fully.

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.160
 But for example, if you speed,

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:51.440
 let's say a speed limit's been changed from 30 to 20,

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.600
 which happened in Wales and some bits of Wales recently,

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:56.000
 and you drive through several cameras in one day,

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.280
 you're technically speeding through all of them.

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:00.560
 And let's say, 'cause the postal system's a bit slow,

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:01.760
 you're doing that for two weeks

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:03.680
 before the first thing catches up with you.

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:06.200
 - What a terrible thing to do on your doorstep.

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:07.760
 - Suddenly. - When you know.

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:11.320
 - Right, so like two weeks later, after commuting,

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:15.240
 let's say 20 miles each way and going 30 when, you know,

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.400
 the limit's suddenly 20,

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:18.560
 you're doing 150% of the speed limit.

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:20.120
 Yeah, so for whatever reason.

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:21.280
 - That's a slow post, though,

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:25.440
 if he's racked up 220 points before he got the first letter.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:27.400
 - Yeah, but if every camera that you speed through

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.840
 is three points, I can see it working out.

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:30.680
 - I could just have a rack up.

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:32.800
 My mum drove with 14 points on her license

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:33.960
 for a couple of years.

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:34.800
 - Oh, yeah?

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:36.320
 - Yep, the way she got away with it

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:38.880
 was when she should have lost her license.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:41.200
 And I'm not saying this wasn't justified.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.200
 Her lawyer argued that the school run

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:45.280
 was a very important time to bond with her children.

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:47.160
 - Oh my God. - And she would look

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:50.600
 at his house on very important parent-child relationships.

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:51.760
 - Are they serious?

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:54.000
 - Yes, she was then banned properly two years later

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.160
 when she was caught again, but yeah.

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:58.040
 We got that extra two years of parent-child bonding

00:23:58.040 --> 00:23:59.400
 and I thought that was very important.

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:01.200
 - She gets your names mixed up all the time.

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:03.440
 (laughing)

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:04.600
 - That's not true, Judith.

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:06.200
 - Wow, I'm a huge fan of yours.

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:08.780
 (upbeat music)

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:13.400
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.720
 and that is Andy.

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:17.280
 - My fact is that under their main tongue,

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:19.720
 lemurs have another tongue.

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:20.920
 (laughing)

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:21.760
 - Sexy.

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.520
 - Lemurs have two tongues, yeah, sexy.

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:24.360
 - Yeah? - Sexy stuff.

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:25.200
 - That's cool.

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.960
 - And this second tongue is just for guessing.

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:28.500
 No, it's sadly not.

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.040
 It's a cleaning structure.

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:32.880
 But it's still a second tongue, it's called a sublingua.

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:34.640
 So they have to think of a tooth comb,

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.160
 which is this structure, I mean,

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.280
 it's exactly as it sounds.

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:40.160
 It's a group of teeth that look like a comb, fine.

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.800
 And they use that for grooming,

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:45.040
 so they run that tooth comb across their fur,

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:46.600
 and it helps to pick out all the-

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:47.440
 - And this is in the mouth.

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:49.320
 - This is in the mouth, yeah.

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:52.840
 But this tooth comb, like a normal comb, gets full of air.

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:53.680
 - Yep.

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:55.600
 - So how do you clean the comb?

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:57.720
 You do it with your second tongue.

00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.600
 - It's a sublingua, which is an undertongue,

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:02.560
 and it's specifically for cleaning out the tooth comb.

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:05.640
 I don't know what they use to clean the tongue.

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:06.800
 - Oh, yeah.

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:07.640
 Hang on, does this mean that

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.200
 do they have to get the undertongue up

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.480
 and over the first tongue to clean it?

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:12.320
 - No.

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:13.280
 - Or do they swivel around the top tongues?

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:15.560
 - No, they just sort of stick out their tongue.

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:17.520
 It doesn't look as much like a tongue

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:18.680
 as you and I are hoping.

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:21.720
 It's a small and slightly harder,

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:24.240
 like a more pointy structure.

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:25.880
 But it is a sublingua.

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:28.960
 - Are there many sublinguas in the natural world?

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.640
 I couldn't really find many animals

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:32.000
 that have more than one tongue.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.360
 - I'd be surprised just because lemurs are so weird

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.800
 because they're on Madagascar,

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.800
 and Madagascar is evolutionarily really quite separate,

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.880
 because it's split off from Africa

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:44.120
 and then from the Asian subcontinent.

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:47.080
 90 million years ago, 180 million years,

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:47.920
 it split from Africa.

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:49.640
 Then 90 million years later, India left,

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.720
 and it's just, Madagascar's just left there

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.440
 hanging out for weird stuff to evolve.

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:54.280
 - So that's amazing,

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:56.880
 because it's something like 80% of the animals

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:59.240
 that live there are just there,

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.120
 nowhere else in the world, right?

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.920
 - So lemurs, they all live in Madagascar.

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:05.120
 Well, they're all from Madagascar anyway.

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:05.960
 - From, yeah.

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:08.000
 - I was recently on a visit to an animal park in Kent,

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.080
 which was not in Madagascar,

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:11.080
 but they did have lemurs, and it was amazing.

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:11.920
 They're so cool.

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:12.840
 There are more than 100 species,

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:14.720
 and they're all native to Madagascar,

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.360
 and I'm sure we'll get into it.

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:17.360
 They're really endangered

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:19.520
 because of mostly habitat loss

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:20.480
 with a bit of climate change

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:22.080
 and also human hunting thrown in.

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:23.520
 So many of them are really threatened,

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:26.080
 but they're absolutely unbelievable creatures.

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:26.920
 They're so cool.

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:29.000
 - They are, and every single one of them

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.640
 seems to have their own unique thing

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.440
 that's interesting about them.

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:36.040
 We've spoken about this before on the podcast,

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:38.640
 but a few of them are quite solitary animals.

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:40.000
 So even within their family,

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.280
 they will barely see each other.

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:43.280
 And the only way they have any kind of communication

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:45.680
 with each other is by having a pissing tree.

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:48.320
 So they will go down at different times.

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:50.200
 It's like if you live in a big house

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:52.600
 with a lot of siblings and there's one toilet.

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:55.040
 You know, it's like eight, 15 in the morning,

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:56.320
 that's my slot.

00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:58.520
 So they go at different times and they will pee,

00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:00.760
 and they have a unique fingerprint, as it were,

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:03.280
 with their urine, which means that if I was going,

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:06.040
 I'd be like, "Handy's been, okay, I can smell."

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:08.000
 - And what does that tell you

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.280
 about what you're gonna do next?

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:11.720
 Is that like, oh, he must be near Biogo to see him,

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:13.080
 or quite kind? - It means they're okay.

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:14.000
 It's like a checking in.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.880
 It's just like sending a WhatsApp to say,

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:16.720
 "Hey, hope you're well."

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:18.240
 It's like, "Oh, I know they're doing okay."

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:20.480
 - But they just never wanna pee at the same time together.

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:22.240
 - No, they don't wanna see each other.

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:23.880
 - They have no interest. - That's very nice.

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:26.080
 I personally like to have the bathroom to myself as well.

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:28.520
 I'm funny in an old-fashioned like that, but...

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:29.960
 - I invite the family.

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:34.040
 Lemurs, yeah, lemurs very weird.

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:37.800
 Ring-tailed lemurs, the sort of big ones, the famous ones,

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:40.760
 and they make their own perfume.

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:44.120
 So it's not just about secreting one scent.

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:48.080
 They secrete, apparently, a strong but short-lived scent

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:48.920
 in their wrists.

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:52.440
 So, you know, odor-toilet doesn't last very long.

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.280
 - Okay.

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:54.800
 - So there's like an odor-toilet in their wrists,

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:58.400
 and then they secrete a very long-lasting different scent

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:00.960
 from their shoulder glands, like an odor-parfum.

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:04.320
 And then they get their tails, and they dab their shoulders,

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:06.880
 and they dab their wrists to mix the scents together

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:11.640
 in what's known as a wrist-to-pit move in zoology.

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.280
 And then they've got a perfume,

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:14.880
 and then they waft it in the air.

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:15.720
 - The tail?

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:16.680
 - They waft their tail in the air.

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:17.520
 Now they've mixed up the perfume.

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:19.240
 - And that's their mating ritual,

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:20.800
 or is that just general day-to-day?

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:24.760
 - It's mating, and it's so clever, because it's telling,

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:25.760
 I mean, I can't believe,

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:26.880
 sometimes I wonder if I'm making this up,

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:30.200
 but it's telling females their genetic makeup,

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:31.800
 and the females smell it, and they know

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:33.840
 if the male is too similar to them,

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:36.360
 'cause obviously you want maximum genetic diversity

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:38.480
 for your kids, so you sniff their perfume,

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:41.040
 and it's like, "I also use Chanel."

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:41.880
 - Get out.

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:44.480
 - Then you're going to shag someone else.

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:45.720
 - I don't suppose, at any point,

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:49.920
 you read about the northern giant mouse lemur.

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:50.760
 - No.

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:55.280
 - Okay, this is another standout in the lemur tribe.

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:59.160
 They've got testicles, which are the largest,

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:02.400
 I believe, of any primate relative to body size.

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:03.400
 - Okay.

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:04.400
 - As a percentage, then,

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:07.840
 what would you say your testicles are of your body weight?

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:09.840
 - That's a very personal question, isn't it?

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:10.680
 - That's so personal.

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:12.080
 - He's just had mumps.

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:13.600
 (laughing)

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:15.440
 - Of my weight, what percentage?

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:16.760
 - I'm not asking you to give away your weight.

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:19.480
 I'm saying what proportion of your body weight is testicles.

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:21.000
 - We're talking 15%.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.760
 (laughing)

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.080
 - Yeah, you do need to.

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.200
 - Dream on, mate.

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.040
 For them, it's--

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:28.520
 - What were yours to put into context?

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:29.360
 - Sorry?

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:30.200
 - What are yours?

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:33.480
 - I don't, I think for humans, it's kind of 0.2%.

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:36.760
 No, it's less than, it's much less than 1%, you know?

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:39.240
 But for these guys, it's 5% of their body weight

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.080
 is testicles.

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:40.920
 - Wow.

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:42.320
 - It's the equivalent of me,

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.320
 and here's a fun home maths challenge,

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.160
 you can work out how much I weigh,

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:47.440
 it's the equivalent of me having testicles

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:49.400
 that are 3.8 kilos between them.

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:50.240
 - Right.

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.060
 - It's a lot.

00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:51.900
 - Yeah.

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:52.740
 - It's a lot.

00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:54.440
 And they were only discovered in 2005, these things.

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:56.120
 And often, as they swing through the trees,

00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:57.800
 they will bump and bruise their testicles.

00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:59.140
 - Oh, that's a nice one.

00:29:59.140 --> 00:29:59.980
 - That's right.

00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:01.840
 - Oh, I've seen, my friend used to have a sausage dog

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:04.760
 called Dave, and Dave lived upstairs in a flat,

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:06.800
 and he had the longest dangling balls,

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:09.120
 and this poor dog, we used to walk behind him on the stairs.

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:11.400
 They would wallop the top of each step

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:12.240
 as they were going on.

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:15.000
 - I just see these dangling bells.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:15.920
 - Does he mind it?

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:17.840
 Is it like every time he's going?

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:21.080
 - So Blue, who owned Dave, would show people,

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:22.360
 because he would say it's okay,

00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:24.000
 and he would flip Dave upside down and say,

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.080
 "Look how hardened and leathery they've become,

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:27.560
 "they're okay, he doesn't feel it anymore,

00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:29.840
 "it's like a real hard boxing bag now."

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:30.960
 - That's what you want.

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:33.080
 - But that's like so I can empathize.

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:35.840
 But maybe they've got very leathery hardened testicles.

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:36.880
 - Maybe, let's hope.

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:38.120
 But it's because they have a system

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:39.520
 where everyone has multiple partners,

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:42.160
 male and female, and there's no mating season.

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.640
 So they just need as much sperm as possible.

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:47.240
 - They have to produce a lot of sperm and frequently mate,

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:49.040
 and that's the way they pass their genes on.

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:50.920
 It's a very competitive field.

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:54.000
 - See, I guess a few of the lemurs have this kind of problem

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.760
 where there's just one feature of them

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:59.320
 that is just oddly grown, so that it suits the environment.

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:01.840
 The I.I., which is probably the most famous

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:03.320
 of the lemurs.

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:04.640
 - That Norwegian band.

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:06.900
 (laughing)

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:09.400
 - What?

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:12.160
 (laughing)

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:16.320
 - Yeah, they're a tribute band, uh-huh, I.I.

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:19.480
 They're a nautically themed uh-huh tribute band.

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:24.400
 - So the I.I. has a tremendously long finger.

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:27.920
 It uses the finger to get into trees and pick out grubs.

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:30.400
 So like how hummingbirds will have a long nose

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:33.080
 to suck like a straw, the I.I. uses its finger.

00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:35.160
 Its finger though is so long, it has the same thing

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:37.440
 as it's walking along, it has to raise it up.

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:39.920
 Otherwise, it basically trips on its own finger

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:41.800
 as it's going along, and it's very delicate.

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:43.760
 So, you know, it could sprain the finger,

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:45.720
 or it could do major damage to it.

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:47.080
 - I hadn't thought about that, 'cause it is,

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:48.480
 it looks like E.T., the I.I.,

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:51.120
 with that ridiculously long middle finger.

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:53.520
 So it's about the size of a house cat,

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:55.560
 but its middle finger is eight centimeters long.

00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:58.600
 So imagine a house cat, but with an eight centimeter long

00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:01.560
 middle finger, and yeah, 'cause you see,

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:03.240
 when you see people who've got really good manicures,

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:04.760
 I always think, how on earth do you get anything done?

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:07.600
 But they, the whole time, must struggle.

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:09.960
 But what's amazing about them is that they're only primates

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:12.920
 that echolocate, and the way they do it

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:14.880
 is by tapping on trees.

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.360
 I kind of think this is cheating.

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:19.240
 Basically, they tap on trees like woodpeckers

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:21.720
 until they find a hollow bit, and then the hollow bit

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:23.360
 tells them that that's the place where bugs

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:24.720
 are probably living in when they eat it.

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:26.000
 - Oh, I thought you said cheating?

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:26.840
 - Yeah.

00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:28.640
 - Well, it's easier to tap on a wall

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:29.960
 until you find a hollow bit, rather than--

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:32.840
 - To frown and to go, mew, do you mean that kind of thing?

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:36.440
 - I thought you meant like, just like, anyone, anyone in?

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:39.240
 - Like the wolf at the little pig's door.

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:40.080
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:41.920
 - "Let me in, little bugs."

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:43.400
 I just think it's not as impressive as bats

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:45.160
 who can navigate all around the world,

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:47.080
 and they're just tapping on a tree to find the bug.

00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:48.320
 - To learn that, though, is pretty,

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:49.880
 they're the only ones that do that as well.

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:51.360
 - I think that's the thing about lemurs,

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:54.680
 is that they're all very well adapted

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:57.040
 to the areas they find themselves in,

00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:59.760
 and they have also filled all the ecological niches

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:01.840
 that might be filled by other animals.

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:04.320
 So you were saying the I.I. fills a roll

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:05.760
 that might be taken by a hummingbird.

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:08.840
 Well, you know, so on Madagascar,

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:12.880
 every biological function that might fit into a food web,

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.960
 a lot of them are filled by different species of lemur,

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:16.800
 who are really, really well adapted to do that.

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:18.360
 But obviously, when the environment changes,

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:20.800
 or when the habitat is lost, they really struggle,

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:23.120
 because they're adapted for one specific environment.

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:25.080
 - Yeah, yeah, it is wild.

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:27.080
 Lemurs, what does that mean?

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:28.160
 Lemur?

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:29.000
 - Lemur.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.560
 - Lemur.

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:31.400
 - I think I know the answer.

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:32.240
 It's Latin.

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:33.200
 - Oh.

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:34.640
 - For ghost.

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:35.960
 - Okay, hear me out.

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:38.120
 Emperor Tiberius has his toughest case yet.

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:40.480
 (laughing)

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:41.320
 It's a ghost.

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:42.680
 - Something's been tapping my trees.

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:44.160
 - So he just hangs a bunch of lemurs.

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:45.000
 We move on.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:45.840
 Next episode.

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:48.840
 - Yeah, they're called ghosts.

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:51.400
 And then Linnaeus is the one who applied it to the lemurs,

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:53.640
 because he thought their faces looked so ghostly.

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:56.720
 And so they are the ghosts of Madagascar.

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:58.840
 - Do you know what else means ghosts in the animal world?

00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:01.520
 - Weirdly, it's larvae, which I didn't know.

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:02.360
 - Lavae.

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:06.520
 - So lemurais and larvae are basically the same cluster

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:07.360
 of things in Latin.

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:08.760
 In ancient Rome, they were the two types

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:10.040
 of evil ghosts you'd get.

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:10.880
 Isn't that weird?

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:12.200
 - Wow.

00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:14.880
 - Yeah, we do a bit of vilifying humans for hunting them,

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:17.200
 or I find in some of the naturalist writing,

00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:18.720
 there's some vilifying humans for hunting them,

00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:20.840
 which I think is completely insane,

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:25.120
 because 40 to 50% of people in Madagascar are malnourished,

00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:27.120
 which is pretty extraordinary.

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:29.320
 - And also the early humans did not know

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:31.040
 they were doing this, I don't know.

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:32.760
 - They didn't know that, but yeah, but today,

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:35.240
 like they're still hunted and eaten a lot today,

00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:36.920
 and that's one of the things that's putting them in danger.

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.600
 And it's because over half of households in Madagascar

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:42.680
 have understandably eaten lemur meat in the last year,

00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:44.360
 'cause that's the meat that's available,

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:45.800
 and half of them are malnourished.

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:47.920
 But there is this cool project,

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:50.520
 which is the bacon bug project,

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:52.760
 which is to farm succondry,

00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:54.800
 which are these still very cute little bugs

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:59.120
 that have long, pink, trunk things on their noses

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:00.880
 and like little furry backsides,

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:04.080
 but they are delicious, tastes like bacon when fried,

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:05.600
 and they've started farming them.

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:08.760
 And in the pilot community where they've started farming them,

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:10.000
 over the last three years,

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.800
 they've reduced lemur hunting by 50%.

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:14.120
 - Wow, that's great. - Which is pretty strong.

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:14.960
 - Yeah.

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:16.320
 - Can I give you one last lemur?

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:17.160
 Yeah.

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:18.680
 This is the red-fronted lemur,

00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:21.200
 and it does something pretty relatable.

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:23.400
 It chews up poisonous millipedes.

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:24.520
 That's not the relatable bit.

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:27.080
 Actually, none of this is relatable.

00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:29.600
 It rubs the resulting goo on its genitals.

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:31.400
 I said it wasn't relatable.

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:34.760
 - No, no, keep going, this is my weekend.

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:36.760
 - But it's so cool.

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:38.680
 It's because they have lots of parasites,

00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:40.400
 and these millipedes have toxic goo in them,

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:41.640
 if you chew them right.

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.360
 So they chew the millipedes up just enough

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:46.040
 that they release this really toxic orange slime,

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:49.040
 and then they slather it all over their genitals,

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:51.560
 their perianal region, and their tail,

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:55.400
 and that kills off the parasites

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:57.240
 that have been preying on the lemur,

00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:59.080
 and then they swallow the millipede whole,

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:01.000
 so it's a tasty snack as well as a--

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.040
 - Interesting. - Lovely.

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:03.280
 Perianal. - Perianal.

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:05.160
 - Perianal cream.

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:08.800
 - They need to work on the markers for that snack, don't they?

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:11.360
 - It just sounds like something from Nando's.

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:12.640
 - Perianal. - Perianal.

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:16.280
 - Well, this is not lemon and herb.

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:17.760
 This is spicy hot.

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:21.040
 And it also seems to create a little bit of a euphoria

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:22.720
 or a narcotic sensation among them.

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:26.320
 They've been seen chilling out after they've partaken.

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:27.160
 - Really? - Does it?

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:28.960
 Well, you put peri-peri up your arse,

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:31.760
 then you will sometimes get a bit of a hit.

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:34.280
 - Oh, it's hard when you have that flag sticking out, isn't it?

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:41.960
 - Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show,

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:43.440
 and despite him being on holiday,

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:46.200
 James has still sent in one for us to discuss,

00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:48.520
 so here it is, James.

00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:52.120
 - My fact this week is if you built a house

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:54.040
 in a certain point of Italy,

00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:57.360
 you can live in 10 different towns at the same time.

00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:01.440
 Unfortunately, that point is in the middle of a volcano,

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:05.000
 and I am currently at that volcano.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.960
 - Thanks, James. - Amazing stuff.

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:09.440
 - We've never had an on-location fact.

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:11.520
 - No. - James recorded this

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:12.920
 at the place that the fact is about.

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:15.000
 - Yeah, as he just said. - Yeah, I think he just mentioned.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.520
 - As he literally just said, just wanted to hammer it home.

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:18.840
 - James is on a mountain now.

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:21.200
 - He's not on a mountain, he's on an active volcano.

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:22.960
 - No, not right now, 'cause this isn't live.

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:24.360
 Sorry to ruin the illusion.

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:26.480
 - Anna, where is your tradecraft?

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:27.800
 Where is your stage ship?

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:28.640
 - Sorry. - Huh?

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:31.560
 - This is very cool though, isn't it?

00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:35.440
 So this is that the Italian province of Catania,

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:37.720
 which is where Etna is,

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:39.600
 is divided into municipalities,

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:41.720
 and there are 10 municipalities,

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:44.120
 and they all meet at the top of Etna.

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:46.800
 And in fact, I think it's actually split at that peak

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:49.880
 into 11 sections, 'cause one of the municipalities,

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:53.440
 Bronte, scoops around and nicks two portions of it.

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:55.760
 - Yeah, but basically it's 10, basically it's 10.

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:57.720
 - No, I know, but Bronte gets two bites of the cherry,

00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:00.400
 and I think it's worth saying.

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:03.560
 - Yeah, Mount Etna, I had never really read anything

00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:04.800
 about Mount Etna before.

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:07.080
 I assumed it was a standard communal garden,

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:09.040
 small volcano, it's a big volcano.

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:09.880
 - It's a big one, yeah.

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:13.040
 - It's two miles high from sea level.

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:15.400
 - Yeah, yeah. - That's tall, it is.

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:18.280
 - It's the original, it's the OG volcano.

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:19.520
 - What, what do you mean?

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:22.400
 - Well, Etna is where Vulcan lived,

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:26.000
 so the god of the forge and iron smelting

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.040
 and all that stuff, Vulcan lived in Etna,

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:30.200
 and that's why volcanoes are called volcanoes.

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:32.440
 It is the volcano. - Oh, my goodness.

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:33.400
 And just quickly, we should say

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:35.640
 about these 10 points that meet.

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:38.320
 I mean, I gotta say, James, I don't understand this fact.

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:39.280
 I don't know why you'd want to live

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:41.880
 in 10 different towns at the same time.

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:44.000
 Who you paying your council tax to?

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.000
 And so, I mean, I get that these 10 provinces

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.160
 or principalities or towns, they all meet at the same point,

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:52.480
 but Etna is a really confusing place

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:54.280
 because it sounds like it's, you know,

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:56.440
 it sounds like your child's drawing of a volcano,

00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:58.640
 which is two slopes on either side

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:00.200
 and a crater in the middle.

00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:01.200
 And Etna isn't really like that.

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:02.600
 There are dozens of craters, you know,

00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:04.680
 and like new ones open up all the time

00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:07.480
 'cause it keeps on exploding and erupting.

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:08.600
 So I find that really interesting.

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:11.200
 There are more than 200 craters on Etna.

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:12.040
 - God, that's a lot, isn't it?

00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:14.040
 - I know, it's many, many miles around,

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:16.600
 but these places are so cool.

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:20.240
 So Randaco was trilingual until the 16th century,

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:22.400
 which was Greek in one area, Latin in another,

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:24.080
 and Lombard in a third.

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:25.680
 - Is that one of the 10 areas?

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:27.520
 - That's one of the 10 areas.

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:30.600
 There is Bronte, as you mentioned, Anna,

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:32.440
 which is, as we've said before,

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:35.280
 is where Nelson was created Duke of,

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:38.240
 Admiral Horatio Nelson was made Duke of Bronte,

00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:41.840
 and we think it's where the Bronte sisters, their dad,

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:45.960
 he used to be called Bronte, and he renamed himself Bronte,

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:49.160
 maybe after Nelson or maybe after this area.

00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:51.840
 - Which in itself is named after a cyclops, isn't it?

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:52.960
 Who lived there?

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:55.520
 So the Bronte's dad is named after the cyclops.

00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:58.560
 - And Charlotte Bronte being named after a cyclops

00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:00.320
 is just so weird.

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:01.960
 - It's very cool, yeah.

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:04.760
 But what's amazing is it is an active volcano.

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:06.520
 So like James, you know, just very happily

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:09.440
 took his family up there on an active volcano.

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:12.400
 But it's not like it's just people going up

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:13.560
 at their own risk.

00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:15.920
 The whole area is a tourist destination.

00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:18.240
 You've got vineyards at the bottom of it,

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:19.440
 where if there was an eruption,

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:22.120
 absolutely would be taken out by it.

00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:23.800
 - You gotta pick those grapes fast, haven't you?

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:25.560
 It's the lava rolls towards you.

00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:27.840
 - Just pick the big ones.

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:29.000
 Just pick the big ones.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.840
 - This is between November and March.

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:32.800
 I think those are the months.

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:34.800
 There's two ski resorts that open up.

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:37.160
 You can go skiing on an active volcano.

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:38.680
 It's wild, yeah.

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:42.040
 - Sometimes people ski alongside the lava when it's erupted.

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:42.880
 - Cool. - That's mad.

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:43.720
 - Really? - Yeah.

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:44.560
 - Like racing it down.

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:45.920
 - Kind of, yeah, yeah.

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:48.000
 - And people do, people are quite annoying.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.880
 And I think they've introduced legislation now

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:51.440
 because they do go much too close.

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:52.840
 You're supposed to only be a certain distance

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:53.800
 from the lava flow.

00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:56.040
 And you do have people who kind of cook their sausages

00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:57.520
 on it and stuff.

00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:59.360
 - Look, this is Italy.

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:00.560
 It's the land of Romans.

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:02.840
 People will cook their sausages on lava, you know?

00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:03.680
 - It's not it.

00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:05.120
 And it doesn't kill.

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:06.200
 It's incredible.

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:09.040
 And given how famous it is, and it's the OG,

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:12.760
 it's only killed 77 people confirmed in its entire history.

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:15.000
 - Confirmed kills, it's not James Bond.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.920
 - It's got a tally inside its craters.

00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:20.400
 - Are you sure about that?

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:21.440
 - Yeah, I think so.

00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:25.280
 There's this insane account from the big 1669 eruption

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:28.200
 where reports of it that came out much later

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:31.000
 said that 10 to 20,000 people had been killed.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.040
 And still you see it on places like history.com,

00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.280
 Sky History Channel, get your facts right,

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:38.240
 saying 20,000 people were killed.

00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:40.160
 - We're turning into a name and shame podcast now.

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:41.720
 - I'm afraid so.

00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:43.760
 Because there are people that you can't accuse someone

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:45.600
 of killing 20,000 people.

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:48.280
 - Tiberias could, Tiberias could and would.

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:51.400
 In fact, he would probably be on the scene of this.

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:52.480
 - You're absolutely right.

00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:53.640
 - Yeah, have them all killed.

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:54.880
 - Blame the volcano.

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:56.800
 - Can I check on it?

00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:59.640
 Did you say why it didn't actually kill 20,000 people

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:00.960
 in 1669?

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:02.560
 - I think it's, I actually don't know,

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:03.720
 but I think it's mostly slow moving

00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:05.520
 and people just leave.

00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:07.560
 It absolutely destroyed the area.

00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:09.880
 It ruined it economically for hundreds of years.

00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:11.880
 And still it's much, much less fertile

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:13.200
 because of that eruption.

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:15.680
 So they didn't get off scot-free.

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:19.640
 - 'Cause I assumed that it always made the land more fertile

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:21.720
 'cause it sometimes does with things like,

00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:23.360
 you know, the reason there are vineyards there

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:26.040
 is because the soil is so rich and volcanic.

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:28.920
 But I guess sometimes also it's just a dead-end wasteland

00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:29.760
 that it leaves behind.

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:31.560
 So a lot of the time it is good for the--

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:33.040
 - It's a fine balance, isn't it?

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:34.840
 Do you know you don't want to overdo the lava?

00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:35.680
 - Exactly.

00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:36.600
 That one, that explosion, by the way,

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:38.160
 is also as far as we can tell,

00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:40.680
 the first historical recorded attempt

00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:43.600
 to divert the lava stream as it's coming down.

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:46.600
 So there was a town, Katania, one of the 10,

00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:48.920
 and they dug trenches above the village

00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:50.640
 in order to divert the stream of lava

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:51.640
 as it was coming down.

00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:53.600
 Yeah, I mean, but as far back as that.

00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:56.400
 - I think, I believe that their neighboring town

00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:57.560
 was quite pissed off, wasn't it?

00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:58.680
 - 'Cause it went into them.

00:42:58.680 --> 00:42:59.800
 - Well, they re-diverted it.

00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:02.040
 They put a blockage up and it went back to Katania.

00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:03.280
 - It's like, it's like that, guys.

00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:05.440
 - Classic, classic neighbor behavior.

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:06.760
 - Yeah.

00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:07.600
 - It does sound amazing,

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:10.800
 'cause to deal with a flow of lava

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:14.360
 is pretty challenging, even with modern technology.

00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:17.360
 And when you're dealing with it with shovels and pickaxes,

00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:19.000
 dealing, like making a trench like that,

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.400
 it's just incredibly impressive.

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:22.440
 They were wrapped in wet sheepskins

00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:24.120
 to protect themselves from the heat.

00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:25.480
 It's just, it's really impressive.

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:26.320
 - It's crazy.

00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:27.400
 - We give the past a hard time sometimes,

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:29.160
 but sometimes people are impressive, you know?

00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:30.000
 - No, they were hardcore.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:30.840
 - Yeah.

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:34.000
 - So if you were gonna say how tall is Mount Etna,

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.960
 the answer changes over the years.

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:38.600
 I find that wild with volcanoes,

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:40.800
 but basically off the back of certain eruptions.

00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:44.320
 So if you ask that question in 1865,

00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:46.920
 it was 170 feet higher than it is now,

00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:49.120
 because with the eruptions comes collapses internally

00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:51.160
 and it sort of goes up and down in size.

00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:52.000
 - Really?

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:52.840
 - Yeah.

00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:53.920
 - But sometimes the act of erupting means

00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:55.680
 that it leaves lava around the rim,

00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:57.080
 which hardens and then makes it taller.

00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:57.920
 - Exactly, right?

00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:59.240
 - But sometimes it just blows the whole top off

00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:00.600
 and then gets shorter again.

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:02.120
 That'd be cool to solve a crime,

00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:03.480
 like with your national grid thing, Dan,

00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:05.440
 of like, but what height was Etna

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:06.840
 at the time of the offense?

00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:07.680
 - Yes.

00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:11.680
 - As we say, Etna has erupted loads of times,

00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:14.960
 200 times in the last three and a half thousand years.

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:15.800
 - It's good.

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:18.080
 - Once every 17 years, it's a really good score.

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:21.440
 I think the most recent was 2021 when it threw up

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:24.080
 12,000 tons of ash onto a local town.

00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:25.440
 - And so what happens in that moment?

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:26.560
 You're in a surrounding town.

00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:28.080
 Do you evacuate immediately?

00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:28.920
 - You get help.

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:30.360
 - It's not like Vesuvius back in the day

00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:31.360
 where you had to guess,

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:33.160
 these days, officials are there, aren't they?

00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:34.000
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.840
 A big government has taken over,

00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:38.560
 previously charming, like small government,

00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:40.920
 libertarian pastime of surviving volcanoes.

00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:43.520
 But the big thing they're scared of,

00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:44.680
 all the most terrifying prospect

00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:46.280
 is a flank eruption, apparently.

00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:47.680
 So if there's a lava fountain

00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:48.800
 that just goes up from the top,

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:50.240
 again, classic volcano,

00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:52.600
 that is sometimes really bad, obviously.

00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:55.840
 But the worst thing is where the site just blows off.

00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:57.480
 And that's when you get a big river of lava

00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:59.320
 flowing down the side towards your town.

00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:00.160
 It's impossible.

00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:01.880
 - Right, okay.

00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:05.640
 - I found what I think is probably the greatest photo

00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:10.280
 of Mount Etna erupting, taken by a local, okay?

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:13.720
 It was taken in 2013, November 8th,

00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:18.000
 and it was taken by a man called Luca Parmetana.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.760
 Luca Parmetana took it while he was in space

00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:22.600
 on board the International Space Station.

00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:23.520
 - Yes.

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:25.360
 - Heading over it, it was erupting,

00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:27.160
 and he managed to get a photo.

00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:28.560
 And he's from Sicily.

00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:32.320
 So it's a perfect local to the area,

00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:34.120
 manages to get a space photo of it.

00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:36.840
 Luca Parmetana, he was the astronaut

00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:39.920
 who was almost the first person ever to drown in space.

00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:43.040
 If you remember, he was out on a spacewalk

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:47.520
 and within his helmet, the water supply got loose

00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:49.920
 and the water started going into his helmet

00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:51.760
 and droplets went up his nostrils.

00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:53.240
 That's Luca Parmetana.

00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:55.080
 - A little bit less time adjusting your lens

00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:58.280
 and a little bit more time making sure your hood's done up.

00:45:58.280 --> 00:45:59.120
 Maybe Luca.

00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:00.440
 - There's always a critic, isn't there?

00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:02.240
 (laughing)

00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:05.400
 - That's an episode of Tiberius International Space.

00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:08.920
 - An astronaut drowns in space.

00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:09.760
 Tricky.

00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:11.080
 But did anyone here?

00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:11.920
 Doesn't matter.

00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:14.120
 Hang these six people for the crime.

00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:15.120
 See you next week.

00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:18.560
 - Of course, we're referring to it as a volcano,

00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:20.880
 and it's not definitely a volcano.

00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:21.720
 - Oh no.

00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:22.560
 - What?

00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:23.800
 - Are you kidding?

00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:26.640
 - This is according to a geologist

00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:29.560
 and he's called Carmelo Ferralito.

00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:30.640
 - Sounds legit.

00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:31.480
 - Exactly.

00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:34.280
 So he lives near it.

00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:36.400
 And so there's this confusion about it,

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:40.240
 'cause it's always burping, very, very gassy.

00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:43.120
 It belches out more than seven million tons of steam

00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:45.440
 and CO2 and sulfur every year.

00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:47.680
 And everyone says that's 'cause of gas bubbles

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:49.280
 that are released from the magma.

00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:52.280
 But Ferralito says that you'd need

00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:54.680
 about 10 times more lava to be coming out of it

00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:56.640
 to justify all those gas bubbles.

00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:58.760
 So where are they coming from?

00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:00.080
 So some people say,

00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:03.240
 ah, no, what's happening is a lot of the lava's coming out

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:05.280
 and then going back into Etna.

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:07.000
 And he says, if it was doing that,

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.840
 Etna would be inflating like a child's balloon

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:12.120
 every time it erupted, the lava's sinking back.

00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:13.920
 - Which it's not, I presume.

00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:15.560
 - It is not inflating like a balloon.

00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:18.440
 - So it's not a volcano?

00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:19.560
 - It's a hot spring.

00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:21.840
 And he says that--

00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:24.040
 - I would be so pissed off with my real estate agent

00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:27.760
 if I was sold the house next to a hot spring.

00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:30.400
 Only to find out it was an active volcano.

00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:32.480
 - You've already drawn up your star plan.

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:35.200
 - They photographed it from the other side.

00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:37.000
 So you didn't see Etna as a background.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:37.880
 It was very clever.

00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:41.640
 And on the viewing they kept on cunningly misdirecting you.

00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:43.520
 I say, just come and have a look around here

00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:44.560
 at the garage.

00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:50.200
 I would say on that occasion, Dan, caveat emptor.

00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:51.040
 You know?

00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:54.800
 - This guy says that it can only be justified

00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:58.880
 by it being mostly water and CO2 and sulfur,

00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:02.320
 which makes up 70% of the volume that it's spewing out.

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:04.680
 - I'm sorry, I'm sure he's really well qualified,

00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:05.960
 but it is a volcano, isn't it?

00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:08.880
 Because I've literally seen photos of it vomiting lava

00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:11.120
 over a wide area.

00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:12.720
 - You know, take it up with Carmelo.

00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:15.000
 - Carmelo, please.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.480
 - You've got to make an apias of somehow in this life.

00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:18.920
 - The town was completely demolished

00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:20.760
 by a local hot spring.

00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:21.600
 Was it?

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:26.560
 - But everyone's skin was very smooth at the end of it.

00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:32.440
 - Okay, that's it.

00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:33.440
 That is all of our facts.

00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:34.960

 There is a portal, the gateway

00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:13.240

 And you can get tickets to our live show.

00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:17.000
 So we're playing Sheffield in July,

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.880
 but in June, we're going to be in Belgium.

00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:20.960
 We are playing the Nerdland Festival.

00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:22.400
 We've done it twice now.

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:23.240
 It's very exciting.

00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:24.200
 We're going to be back again.

00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:26.440
 Leven Skira, who runs the whole festival,

00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:27.520
 has invited us back.

00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:29.440
