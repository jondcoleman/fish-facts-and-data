00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:14,"- Hello, and welcome to another episode"
00:00:14,00:00:16,"of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:16,00:00:17,a weekly podcast coming to you
00:00:17,00:00:20,from the QI offices in Hoburn.
00:00:20,00:00:22,My name's Dan Schreiber.
00:00:22,00:00:24,It is a three-person podcast this week.
00:00:24,00:00:25,"Well, James is away on holiday."
00:00:25,00:00:28,"I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:28,00:00:31,"and once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:31,00:00:34,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:00:34,00:00:37,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:37,00:00:40,"Starting with fact number one, that is Anna."
00:00:40,00:00:43,- My fact this week is that Essex Police
00:00:43,00:00:47,has a team of six officers trained to grow cannabis.
00:00:47,00:00:48,- What?
00:00:48,00:00:50,"- And that's, yeah, it's what you're funding"
00:00:50,00:00:52,with your taxpayer money. - My taxes.
00:00:52,00:00:55,"Funding the old wacky-backy,"
00:00:55,00:00:56,absolutely being grown by the police.
00:00:56,00:00:57,- By the police. - And they don't--
00:00:57,00:00:58,- It's outrageous.
00:00:58,00:01:00,"- It's ridiculous, they don't even send you any."
00:01:00,00:01:01,- What's the deal?
00:01:01,00:01:04,"- Well, this is an interesting bit of British law anyway,"
00:01:04,00:01:07,"which means that when the police make a big drug seizure,"
00:01:07,00:01:09,then they can work out what the value of the drugs
00:01:09,00:01:11,"would have been, and then claim that value"
00:01:11,00:01:14,back from the drug dealer's assets as like a disincentive.
00:01:14,00:01:16,"So it's like, hey, you've got 100 grand worth of drugs,"
00:01:16,00:01:19,"I'll take your 100 grand car, or whatever."
00:01:19,00:01:21,But they need to work out the value of the drugs.
00:01:21,00:01:23,"The problem is, when they come to a cannabis farm"
00:01:23,00:01:25,"and it's not fully grown yet,"
00:01:25,00:01:27,"then they haven't matured yet,"
00:01:27,00:01:30,they don't have that concentrated THC
00:01:30,00:01:33,"that's what gives cannabis its potency,"
00:01:33,00:01:35,then the dealers can claim it was never gonna be
00:01:35,00:01:38,"very valuable, or it's actually all moldy,"
00:01:38,00:01:39,it wasn't gonna work.
00:01:39,00:01:41,"- So in court, the cheeky lawyers will jump in"
00:01:41,00:01:43,"and say, this was never gonna grow into anything,"
00:01:43,00:01:44,so you can't take anything away.
00:01:44,00:01:46,"- And it's actually discount November,"
00:01:46,00:01:49,so you have to take half off of that.
00:01:49,00:01:50,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:01:50,00:01:52,"You've got a voucher, if you've got the cannabis club card."
00:01:52,00:01:55,"- Just use the offer code, fish, and check out."
00:01:56,00:01:58,"- So they grow it themselves, basically, right?"
00:01:58,00:02:00,To prove how much it's gonna be worth.
00:02:00,00:02:01,- Do they finish growing the whole crop?
00:02:01,00:02:03,"- Yeah, so at the moment, and this is just Essex Police,"
00:02:03,00:02:06,"but I think other police forces are experimenting with it,"
00:02:06,00:02:08,they bust the farm and they take the plants
00:02:08,00:02:10,"and they put them in a special facility they have,"
00:02:10,00:02:14,"and they nurture, grow, and dry the plants properly,"
00:02:14,00:02:16,"and they've learned how to make it maximally profitable,"
00:02:16,00:02:18,"just like the drug dealers would,"
00:02:18,00:02:20,"assuming they're skilled cannabis growers,"
00:02:20,00:02:22,"and then they work out how much it's worth,"
00:02:22,00:02:23,and then they burn it all.
00:02:23,00:02:25,"- Yeah, okay, okay, good."
00:02:25,00:02:27,"Not bit by bit, not joint by joint."
00:02:27,00:02:30,"- Hey, in a series of small fires, yeah."
00:02:30,00:02:33,"- You've got to think they siphon a tiny bit off,"
00:02:33,00:02:36,"write in to podcast.qi.com, and we won't tell anyone."
00:02:36,00:02:37,"- Oh, I'll cross you off."
00:02:37,00:02:39,"If you're a bank copper, just look out."
00:02:39,00:02:40,"- Don't tell Andy, fine."
00:02:40,00:02:43,- So they've recovered over 300 million pounds worth
00:02:43,00:02:46,of what would be the trade for the cannabis
00:02:46,00:02:49,"over the last six years, and so they'll grow it,"
00:02:49,00:02:51,"and they'll be like, okay, that on the street"
00:02:51,00:02:54,"is worth 53,000 pounds, that's what you owe now."
00:02:54,00:02:55,- Wow. - Yeah.
00:02:55,00:02:56,"- Because street value's a tricky thing, isn't it?"
00:02:56,00:02:59,"'Cause obviously there's no price list you can look up,"
00:02:59,00:03:01,"which is why I don't partake,"
00:03:01,00:03:02,because it's just too messy.
00:03:02,00:03:04,"I want to know, you know,"
00:03:04,00:03:06,that you don't have any consumer rights.
00:03:06,00:03:09,- You'll get a text message with a picture of the price list.
00:03:09,00:03:10,"- Oh, okay."
00:03:10,00:03:13,Your dealers are going to have laminated menus.
00:03:13,00:03:16,You're going to have-- - I can't.
00:03:16,00:03:19,- And which wines would you recommend with this skunk?
00:03:19,00:03:23,"I love, what I love about this fact is that"
00:03:23,00:03:26,"it's this sort of like lateral thinking way of policing,"
00:03:26,00:03:28,which I find so interesting.
00:03:28,00:03:29,There's so many methods that are going on now
00:03:29,00:03:32,that we just don't even necessarily know about.
00:03:32,00:03:34,"Like for example, the police have been collaborating"
00:03:34,00:03:37,over the last 10 years with the national grid.
00:03:37,00:03:39,So the frequency of the electricity
00:03:39,00:03:41,"that is being sent out to every home in England,"
00:03:41,00:03:44,"Scotland, Wales, it's typically about 50 hertz,"
00:03:44,00:03:47,and that's the frequency that is being picked up
00:03:47,00:03:49,in the background of every audio recording.
00:03:49,00:03:50,"If you're near a power source,"
00:03:50,00:03:52,that's going to be there as a low buzz.
00:03:52,00:03:54,"So in this room right now, we have electrical sockets."
00:03:54,00:03:57,Every recording like this recording is picking up.
00:03:57,00:04:00,"The Hertz noise, very softly in the background."
00:04:00,00:04:04,"Now, it's not always 50 hertz, there's fluctuations."
00:04:04,00:04:06,And that is because of the nature of supply and demand.
00:04:06,00:04:08,Like when people are watching TV
00:04:08,00:04:10,"and it gets the ad breaks and lots of kettles go on,"
00:04:10,00:04:12,there are small fluctuations that go on on the national grid.
00:04:12,00:04:15,"And when that happens, it happens everywhere."
00:04:15,00:04:18,"Which means if you're recording all of the national grid,"
00:04:18,00:04:19,you're going to have timestamps
00:04:19,00:04:21,on all of these fluctuations.
00:04:21,00:04:23,"So often now police, if they're in court"
00:04:23,00:04:25,and there's a recording of criminals
00:04:25,00:04:27,"that is being used, audio recording,"
00:04:27,00:04:28,and they say that never happened
00:04:28,00:04:30,"at this place at this time,"
00:04:30,00:04:32,they listen to the frequency in the background
00:04:32,00:04:34,and they can match it to the exact time
00:04:34,00:04:37,"at the national grid, isn't that insane?"
00:04:37,00:04:37,Wow.
00:04:37,00:04:38,Isn't that nuts?
00:04:38,00:04:39,And that's been used in court
00:04:39,00:04:41,and that has busted people
00:04:41,00:04:43,who have claimed that the recordings were manufactured.
00:04:43,00:04:45,And it didn't happen when it was said to happen.
00:04:45,00:04:47,"Oh my God, so cover up your plug sockets,"
00:04:47,00:04:48,is what you're saying.
00:04:48,00:04:51,Do all your mugging by the trees.
00:04:51,00:04:54,"Just be away from, and don't record it."
00:04:54,00:04:55,"Don't worry, you're recording it."
00:04:55,00:04:56,Just don't record it.
00:04:56,00:04:57,"Oh yeah, good point."
00:04:57,00:04:59,"That's pretty good, isn't that stunning?"
00:04:59,00:05:01,So that's called electric network frequency
00:05:01,00:05:04,and they've been doing it for 10 years now.
00:05:04,00:05:07,This makes my clever cop workaround thing
00:05:07,00:05:09,look much less impressive.
00:05:09,00:05:11,But this is what I quite like recently.
00:05:11,00:05:13,Did you see the two undercover policemen
00:05:13,00:05:15,who dressed up as Batman and Robin?
00:05:15,00:05:17,"Okay, no."
00:05:17,00:05:19,"It's not as high-tech, but it worked."
00:05:19,00:05:21,It was Inspector Darren Watson
00:05:21,00:05:23,and Police Constable Abdi Osman
00:05:23,00:05:25,and they were patrolling around London
00:05:25,00:05:27,and they're looking for scammers
00:05:27,00:05:29,who were playing illegal rigged gambling games
00:05:29,00:05:31,of tourists and getting loads of money off them.
00:05:31,00:05:33,But people knew their faces by then.
00:05:33,00:05:35,"And so one of them said,"
00:05:35,00:05:37,"""I just remembered I had Batman and Robin costumes"
00:05:37,00:05:40,"""in my house, which could come in useful."""
00:05:40,00:05:43,And they dressed up and they're so bad.
00:05:43,00:05:45,So there's pictures of them arresting these guys
00:05:45,00:05:46,that they've come up to.
00:05:46,00:05:48,And the guy dressed as Robin
00:05:48,00:05:52,is wearing a beige bucket hat with his Robin.
00:05:52,00:05:53,And the bucket hat is the only thing
00:05:53,00:05:54,"that's concealing his face, actually."
00:05:54,00:05:58,So I don't know why he's wearing the full Robin gear.
00:05:58,00:05:58,He's wearing Robin gear.
00:05:58,00:06:00,- 'Cause I think if he was wearing a police officer's
00:06:00,00:06:02,"outfit but a beige bucket hat,"
00:06:02,00:06:04,the wrongs might still spot that.
00:06:04,00:06:05,- I suppose.
00:06:05,00:06:07,"- But that's effective, isn't it?"
00:06:07,00:06:08,- It works.
00:06:08,00:06:08,- I think that's really good.
00:06:08,00:06:10,"I mean, you don't know how many people"
00:06:10,00:06:11,are undercover officers.
00:06:11,00:06:13,"Look around you, like all those living statues."
00:06:13,00:06:14,- Come on.
00:06:14,00:06:15,- Yeah.
00:06:15,00:06:16,- You're trying to tell me that not one of them is a fed.
00:06:16,00:06:19,Or who is a fake police officer the other way around?
00:06:19,00:06:21,Someone pretending to be a police officer.
00:06:21,00:06:22,So there was a thing.
00:06:22,00:06:25,"Remember the TV show, ""The Bill"" 2010 that ended?"
00:06:25,00:06:28,The police force basically had to buy all of the costumes
00:06:28,00:06:31,off of the bill because they were real police costumes.
00:06:31,00:06:32,- Really?
00:06:32,00:06:32,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:06:32,00:06:33,- And burn them.
00:06:33,00:06:35,"- Weirdly, they handed them out"
00:06:35,00:06:37,and they were being worn by actual policemen.
00:06:37,00:06:41,"So they reused the clothing of the bill, the TV show."
00:06:41,00:06:42,- They had so exciting for those clothes
00:06:42,00:06:44,"'cause that's like a promotion, isn't it?"
00:06:44,00:06:45,- Yeah.
00:06:45,00:06:47,"- I do have this, now I've seen it in my head"
00:06:47,00:06:48,as quite nice relationship.
00:06:48,00:06:49,And I think no one else sees that.
00:06:49,00:06:51,But basically that very famous day
00:06:51,00:06:54,"of the last few years, drill music has become associated"
00:06:54,00:06:55,with gang crime.
00:06:55,00:06:59,And the lyrics of drill songs will reference people
00:06:59,00:07:00,who've been murdered on the streets.
00:07:00,00:07:04,"And like say, I'm going to get you to a rival gang."
00:07:04,00:07:05,"- Would it say that kind of,"
00:07:05,00:07:06,even that kind of foul language is you?
00:07:06,00:07:09,"- I don't know if I go that far, but."
00:07:09,00:07:11,- Which one of us is going to just buckle
00:07:11,00:07:13,and actually ask what drill is?
00:07:13,00:07:14,- Not me.
00:07:14,00:07:16,"- Okay, me, though, continue."
00:07:16,00:07:17,"- Hang on, you guys don't listen to drill music"
00:07:17,00:07:18,in your spare time.
00:07:18,00:07:20,"- Is that like heavy rap, right?"
00:07:20,00:07:21,In terms of like lyrically.
00:07:21,00:07:22,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:07:22,00:07:23,"- I listen to road works,"
00:07:23,00:07:26,but that's because I'm really interested in infrastructure.
00:07:26,00:07:26,"So, yeah."
00:07:26,00:07:28,"- Yeah, that's exactly what I'm talking about."
00:07:28,00:07:31,You go on believing that that's what I'm referencing.
00:07:31,00:07:34,"- Oh yeah, Silver Town Tunnel Classics."
00:07:34,00:07:35,"Yeah, great."
00:07:35,00:07:38,"Oh, Thames Tideway Tunnel."
00:07:38,00:07:40,"Yeah, I'm digging it."
00:07:40,00:07:42,"- Well, I really like the idea"
00:07:42,00:07:44,"that you would join the police and misunderstand this,"
00:07:44,00:07:45,"'cause in Manchester, basically,"
00:07:45,00:07:47,"the police have been recruited to,"
00:07:47,00:07:49,"and it's called the Excalibur Task Force,"
00:07:49,00:07:51,"which is trying to stop knife crime,"
00:07:51,00:07:53,recruited to get lots of intelligence from drill music.
00:07:53,00:07:55,"So, if you were employed by them,"
00:07:55,00:07:57,I guess you would go and eavesdrop on building sites.
00:07:57,00:07:59,What you're meant to do is watch loads of YouTube videos
00:07:59,00:08:01,and then pick up the names that are being dropped
00:08:01,00:08:04,"and figure out who's pissed off about what,"
00:08:04,00:08:06,'cause it's referencing real things.
00:08:06,00:08:07,"- Oh, right, okay, right."
00:08:07,00:08:08,"- It's like pre-crime,"
00:08:08,00:08:11,but the pre-crimes have maybe been turned into songs.
00:08:11,00:08:13,- Exactly.
00:08:13,00:08:15,"And then just, yeah, so you know where to keep a watch out,"
00:08:15,00:08:17,"but then the drill artists know the police are watching them,"
00:08:17,00:08:20,so then they'll reference the police in return.
00:08:20,00:08:21,"So as long as they'll be like,"
00:08:21,00:08:25,"""Oh, you Excalibur naughty boys spying on us."""
00:08:25,00:08:27,- Do they put out fake news as well?
00:08:27,00:08:27,Do they say--
00:08:27,00:08:28,"- Well, they should, shouldn't they?"
00:08:28,00:08:30,"- Yeah, we're gonna get Mr. Banana tonight"
00:08:30,00:08:31,down by the old co-op.
00:08:31,00:08:33,"And actually, there is no Mr. Banana."
00:08:33,00:08:34,- So good.
00:08:34,00:08:35,"- I mean, that kind of--"
00:08:35,00:08:37,"- If you said that just a bit faster,"
00:08:37,00:08:40,"you would have been a mighty drill artist, I would say."
00:08:40,00:08:43,(laughing)
00:08:43,00:08:44,- Can I tell you an example of maybe
00:08:44,00:08:46,the coolest detective ever?
00:08:46,00:08:47,"- Oh, okay."
00:08:47,00:08:50,- Have you ever heard of the Roman emperor Tiberius?
00:08:50,00:08:51,- Yes.
00:08:51,00:08:54,"- He once solved a crime by,"
00:08:54,00:08:56,he turned detective in ancient Rome.
00:08:56,00:08:57,- Okay.
00:08:57,00:08:58,- I just love this so much.
00:08:58,00:09:02,"There was this woman called Apronia, who was murdered."
00:09:02,00:09:04,"Well, she fell from a high window and died."
00:09:04,00:09:06,"And she was the wife of a praetor,"
00:09:06,00:09:09,a very senior official called Sylvanus.
00:09:09,00:09:12,She was the daughter of a really senior general
00:09:12,00:09:14,in ancient Rome called Apronius.
00:09:14,00:09:16,She was Apronia.
00:09:16,00:09:18,So she was a very significant young woman
00:09:18,00:09:20,and very powerfully connected.
00:09:20,00:09:21,"And her father thought,"
00:09:21,00:09:23,I don't believe she fell out of this window and died.
00:09:23,00:09:26,I think she might've been pushed or thrown out of the window.
00:09:26,00:09:28,And he took the matter to the emperor Tiberius.
00:09:28,00:09:31,"And Tiberius said, ""I'm on the case."""
00:09:31,00:09:33,And then investigated--
00:09:33,00:09:34,- Really?
00:09:34,00:09:37,"- Went to the crime scene, questioned people."
00:09:37,00:09:40,This is a TV series begging to be made.
00:09:40,00:09:40,- Yeah.
00:09:40,00:09:41,- Stop pitching TV series.
00:09:41,00:09:45,"- He's a cop, but he's also the emperor of Rome."
00:09:45,00:09:46,"That's, yeah, I'm in."
00:09:46,00:09:48,- Did he put on a Batman costume to conceal
00:09:48,00:09:51,that he was in fact the emperor?
00:09:51,00:09:52,- I just think this has hit written all over it.
00:09:52,00:09:54,Like he's halfway through fingerprinting somewhere
00:09:54,00:09:55,"and someone comes up like,"
00:09:55,00:09:57,"""Someone's invaded Gaul, what do we do?"""
00:09:57,00:10:00,"And he's got, ""Oh, he's got trouble at home as well."""
00:10:00,00:10:03,I just feel like this is a good series.
00:10:03,00:10:04,- How did he solve it?
00:10:04,00:10:06,"- Well, I think he just decreed"
00:10:06,00:10:07,that the guy was guilty.
00:10:07,00:10:10,(all laughing)
00:10:10,00:10:13,- You're always gonna get your end in every episode.
00:10:13,00:10:15,- How's he gonna solve this one?
00:10:15,00:10:16,He hasn't.
00:10:16,00:10:17,"Okay, no worries."
00:10:17,00:10:20,- But anyone else is waiting for a genius reveal there.
00:10:20,00:10:23,- What's one more guy?
00:10:23,00:10:25,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:10:25,00:10:26,- Supposedly he did things like this.
00:10:26,00:10:27,Like he crops up in plenty of lot.
00:10:27,00:10:30,Supposedly he investigated things like searches
00:10:30,00:10:31,for sea monsters and things like this.
00:10:31,00:10:34,"He was interested in evidence and, you know,"
00:10:34,00:10:37,"but he decided that on the balance of probabilities,"
00:10:37,00:10:40,"Sylvanas was guilty, the husband, that is,"
00:10:40,00:10:44,and Sylvanas then had someone cut his wrists and he died.
00:10:44,00:10:45,- Nice.
00:10:45,00:10:47,"Well done, Type-Rus."
00:10:47,00:10:49,- You're a credit.
00:10:49,00:10:52,"- Can I just quickly,"
00:10:52,00:10:53,"I know we're talking about the police now,"
00:10:53,00:10:56,can I tell you one more of these cannabis-related facts?
00:10:56,00:10:57,"- Oh, yeah."
00:10:57,00:10:59,- Because the scams are developing
00:10:59,00:11:01,that cannabis growers are using.
00:11:01,00:11:03,I just find some of them unbelievable.
00:11:03,00:11:05,"And so last year, this happened,"
00:11:05,00:11:07,"a guy from North London, he was called Charles Reeves."
00:11:07,00:11:09,He'd been working abroad for a bit
00:11:09,00:11:12,"and he'd let his flat out, his family home,"
00:11:12,00:11:13,because he was going to be working overseas
00:11:13,00:11:15,"for some months, I think."
00:11:15,00:11:19,"He got back, he found, in his flat, can you guess?"
00:11:19,00:11:20,- A cannabis farm.
00:11:20,00:11:23,- 10 tons of soil that he literally moved in.
00:11:23,00:11:27,"10 tons of soil to grow cannabis in,"
00:11:27,00:11:30,three feet deep on the floors.
00:11:30,00:11:30,- Wow.
00:11:30,00:11:31,- Imagine getting back to your home
00:11:31,00:11:35,"three feet deep in a soil, a flat."
00:11:35,00:11:36,- You'd be so confused.
00:11:36,00:11:39,Is this a weird earthquake or something?
00:11:39,00:11:41,"- Yeah, and there was obviously,"
00:11:41,00:11:43,there was cannabis growing everywhere
00:11:43,00:11:44,and it had been abandoned
00:11:44,00:11:45,because he'd been coming back to it.
00:11:45,00:11:47,But they'd hacked into the electricity system
00:11:47,00:11:48,"to bypass the meter,"
00:11:48,00:11:51,'cause that's one of the other ways you catch cannabis farmers
00:11:51,00:11:53,is they use a huge amount of electricity
00:11:53,00:11:58,"and so you spot unusual uses of electricity, basically."
00:11:58,00:12:00,"- Right, that's so funny."
00:12:00,00:12:01,What does he do with it?
00:12:01,00:12:02,Does he sipen a bit off the top?
00:12:02,00:12:03,- I don't believe so.
00:12:03,00:12:04,- He's obsessed with the siphoning off the top.
00:12:04,00:12:07,- People have got to start siphoning.
00:12:07,00:12:09,I hate waste.
00:12:09,00:12:11,- Yeah.
00:12:11,00:12:14,- What do you want to do after you've smoked a joint?
00:12:14,00:12:15,You want to--
00:12:15,00:12:17,"- Report yourself immediately to the police,"
00:12:17,00:12:18,it's what I would do.
00:12:18,00:12:20,"But what, is there something else you want to do?"
00:12:20,00:12:22,- People want to eat a lot of food.
00:12:22,00:12:24,- You want to binge on some cakes.
00:12:24,00:12:25,"- Cake, okay."
00:12:25,00:12:27,- And this is just my way of segueing
00:12:27,00:12:29,because have you guys heard of cake finds?
00:12:29,00:12:30,- No.
00:12:30,00:12:33,- This is a thing in the police force and they're huge.
00:12:33,00:12:35,"So these are, if you do something wrong in the police"
00:12:35,00:12:37,"and it's big, like massive corruption"
00:12:37,00:12:38,"or whatever you get in real trouble,"
00:12:38,00:12:40,"if you do something wrong and it's small,"
00:12:40,00:12:41,you get a cake find.
00:12:41,00:12:44,So examples of something that is a cake find
00:12:44,00:12:46,is spraying a colleague in the face
00:12:46,00:12:47,with incapacitant spray.
00:12:47,00:12:49,"- Oh, wow."
00:12:49,00:12:50,- Filing a deceased report
00:12:50,00:12:52,and putting your own name on it by accident.
00:12:52,00:12:54,"Someone did that, cake find."
00:12:54,00:12:57,Falling through a roof while searching a suspect's house.
00:12:57,00:12:59,These are all things that have caused cake finds
00:12:59,00:13:00,to be issued.
00:13:00,00:13:01,- I think you should be fine for that.
00:13:01,00:13:03,"- No, 'cause that, you could die, right?"
00:13:03,00:13:04,- Yeah.
00:13:04,00:13:06,"- That one, that feels, yeah."
00:13:06,00:13:08,"Oh, how soon is the fine levied on the person?"
00:13:08,00:13:10,Is it like while you're waiting for the ambulance
00:13:10,00:13:10,to pick him up?
00:13:10,00:13:12,"- It's once they're out of the coma,"
00:13:12,00:13:14,I think you come up and gently say.
00:13:14,00:13:15,- Is there a gradation of cake finds?
00:13:15,00:13:18,"Is it like we want something with three tiers,"
00:13:18,00:13:20,like we want icing in between all the tiers
00:13:20,00:13:21,and we want some ruffles on the top?
00:13:21,00:13:25,"- Maybe, but it's all decided on by the cake legislator"
00:13:25,00:13:27,who's consulted on social media by any police force.
00:13:27,00:13:30,"If you go to the cake legislator on Twitter,"
00:13:30,00:13:31,"then they'll have a policeman saying,"
00:13:31,00:13:35,"look, my colleague dropped the police car keys in the drain."
00:13:35,00:13:36,What does he get?
00:13:36,00:13:37,"And the cake legislator will say,"
00:13:37,00:13:39,that's a Krispy Kreme tray.
00:13:39,00:13:41,"- Sorry, this is an account on Twitter,"
00:13:41,00:13:44,"which is, is it a real police officer behind this?"
00:13:44,00:13:45,"- Yeah, no one knows who it is,"
00:13:45,00:13:46,but I think it was the telegraph
00:13:46,00:13:48,who interviewed them by email.
00:13:48,00:13:50,- But we believe they're a real police officer.
00:13:50,00:13:52,"- God, is it just a kid pissing about"
00:13:52,00:13:55,and the whole police force is just asking for it?
00:13:55,00:13:57,"- But I like that, I like the mystery."
00:13:57,00:13:58,- Can I say one more thing?
00:13:58,00:13:59,Just one last thing before we move on.
00:13:59,00:14:00,This definitely would have resulted
00:14:00,00:14:04,in a lot of cake being brought to the police station.
00:14:04,00:14:04,This happened last year.
00:14:04,00:14:06,"The UK's police and crime minister,"
00:14:06,00:14:09,"Dame Diana Johnson, had her purse stolen."
00:14:09,00:14:11,Her purse was stolen at an annual conference
00:14:11,00:14:13,"for senior police officers,"
00:14:13,00:14:15,where she was giving a speech on the current epidemic
00:14:15,00:14:17,of theft and shoplifting in the UK.
00:14:17,00:14:19,- Love this stuff.
00:14:19,00:14:21,(upbeat music)
00:14:21,00:14:25,"- Okay, it's time for fact number two."
00:14:25,00:14:26,And that is my fact.
00:14:26,00:14:28,"My fact this week is that in France,"
00:14:28,00:14:31,there are some cars that are so tiny
00:14:31,00:14:34,that you don't even need a driver's license to drive them.
00:14:34,00:14:36,- Is this 'cause we all know you've had trouble
00:14:36,00:14:38,getting a driving license?
00:14:38,00:14:39,- I think that's the answer.
00:14:39,00:14:41,"- I honestly, we was trying to look at shortcuts"
00:14:41,00:14:43,of how do you get a license quicker.
00:14:43,00:14:44,And is that how you found this?
00:14:44,00:14:47,"- Yeah, this is how this came up."
00:14:47,00:14:49,"It was in France, you can get it as quick as seven hours."
00:14:49,00:14:52,Now this is not technically a real driving license
00:14:52,00:14:54,because it's not a license at all.
00:14:54,00:14:58,"What this is, is if you don't mind not being in a real car,"
00:14:58,00:15:00,"going at a real speed,"
00:15:00,00:15:03,but instead are happy to sit in a two-seater tiny car
00:15:03,00:15:06,"going at a really slow pace, then this is what you can do."
00:15:06,00:15:08,"- They're called ""voitures sans permis"", aren't they?"
00:15:08,00:15:10,Literally a car without a license.
00:15:10,00:15:11,- Exactly.
00:15:11,00:15:12,- And they're amazing to look at.
00:15:12,00:15:15,"They're not tiny, tiny, they're not like clown cars."
00:15:15,00:15:19,"- They are slow, slow, 20 miles an hour max."
00:15:19,00:15:21,"It's like a run fast, isn't it?"
00:15:21,00:15:23,"- Yeah, they're also known as ""voiturettes"","
00:15:23,00:15:25,literally little cars.
00:15:25,00:15:26,"But they're everywhere in France,"
00:15:26,00:15:28,"and people have them and drive them around,"
00:15:28,00:15:29,and they change hands as well.
00:15:29,00:15:31,"So if someone loses their license,"
00:15:31,00:15:33,"they will get a VSP as they're called,"
00:15:33,00:15:34,"""voitures sans permis"","
00:15:34,00:15:36,"and then as soon as they get their license back,"
00:15:36,00:15:38,maybe they'll pass that car on to someone else.
00:15:38,00:15:40,"- Well, this is, I mean, this is the amazing thing."
00:15:40,00:15:41,You could lose your license
00:15:41,00:15:43,"because you've been drink driving or whatever reason,"
00:15:43,00:15:45,"and you can literally get out of that car,"
00:15:45,00:15:47,"go down to a dealership, buy a smaller car,"
00:15:47,00:15:49,and be back on the road instantly.
00:15:49,00:15:52,"- You're meant to do a few extra layers, aren't you?"
00:15:52,00:15:54,"But I think in practice, often unofficially,"
00:15:54,00:15:55,they're just bored and sold.
00:15:55,00:15:57,"- Exactly, like in the back roads of rural France,"
00:15:57,00:15:59,no one's really checking that.
00:15:59,00:16:00,- That's true.
00:16:00,00:16:02,Do you know you don't need a driving license
00:16:02,00:16:03,to be an F1 driver?
00:16:03,00:16:04,- Get out.
00:16:04,00:16:06,"- Yeah, they changed the rules last year, actually."
00:16:06,00:16:08,- They liberalised that.
00:16:08,00:16:10,"That's very against the grain of modern life, isn't it?"
00:16:10,00:16:11,"Normally, they're tightening things up,"
00:16:11,00:16:13,"saying, ""Well, we've got to stop all this."""
00:16:13,00:16:15,- They thought we've gone too far
00:16:15,00:16:17,demanding people have a normal driving license
00:16:17,00:16:18,to drive an F1 car.
00:16:18,00:16:21,- Wasn't there a kid in Belgium who was an F1 driver?
00:16:21,00:16:23,- So Kimmy Antonelli was the person
00:16:23,00:16:25,for whom I think they might have changed the rules
00:16:25,00:16:28,"that last year, and he was 17 at the time,"
00:16:28,00:16:29,"didn't have a driving license,"
00:16:29,00:16:31,"but they wanted him to replace Lewis Hamilton,"
00:16:31,00:16:32,"which he now has done,"
00:16:32,00:16:35,because Lewis Hamilton left Mercedes to go to Ferrari.
00:16:35,00:16:38,"So this guy, this 17-year-old guy,"
00:16:38,00:16:39,"didn't have a license,"
00:16:39,00:16:41,"and yeah, you now don't need one."
00:16:41,00:16:42,"You need to do other things,"
00:16:42,00:16:44,like prove you're amazing at winning driving races
00:16:44,00:16:46,and be very good at karting or motorsports
00:16:46,00:16:47,and things like that.
00:16:47,00:16:51,"But he, I mean, he did in fact end up"
00:16:51,00:16:53,"passing his driving test at the start of this year,"
00:16:53,00:16:57,six weeks before competing in his first F1 race.
00:16:57,00:16:59,- Wow. - But isn't that amazing?
00:16:59,00:17:00,- That is amazing.
00:17:00,00:17:02,"I suppose they're kind of different skills,"
00:17:02,00:17:03,as in you're not as worried about traffic
00:17:03,00:17:04,when you're doing Formula One.
00:17:04,00:17:06,- It's like there's no indicating.
00:17:06,00:17:07,- Is it a three-point turn?
00:17:07,00:17:08,- Rarely roundabouts.
00:17:08,00:17:11,(laughing)
00:17:11,00:17:13,- Has she gone really off course?
00:17:13,00:17:14,- Did they have a thing where they can
00:17:14,00:17:16,just wee any time they like?
00:17:16,00:17:17,- I think you can do that in your own car anyway.
00:17:17,00:17:18,(laughing)
00:17:18,00:17:19,- That's a good point.
00:17:19,00:17:20,What are we thinking?
00:17:20,00:17:21,I do that all the time on my own car.
00:17:21,00:17:21,- Is that part of the test?
00:17:21,00:17:23,Is that why I failed my last test?
00:17:23,00:17:24,(laughing)
00:17:24,00:17:25,- No.
00:17:25,00:17:25,- I don't know if it's a number two.
00:17:25,00:17:26,- Is it?
00:17:26,00:17:28,(laughing)
00:17:28,00:17:30,"There's no, surely there's no rule."
00:17:30,00:17:32,Like no one's thought of making that a rule
00:17:32,00:17:32,in the driving test.
00:17:32,00:17:33,- No one's thought of it.
00:17:33,00:17:34,- I don't know why you've said it.
00:17:34,00:17:37,"Yeah, where, I think I assumed"
00:17:37,00:17:39,that Formula One drivers have to have
00:17:39,00:17:41,a bottle to wean or something.
00:17:41,00:17:41,- I can't remember what they do.
00:17:41,00:17:43,"- You think a Formula One driver,"
00:17:43,00:17:45,"going at the speeds they're going at,"
00:17:45,00:17:47,are gonna pull out a Coke bottle
00:17:47,00:17:49,and try pissing to it and mid-drive.
00:17:49,00:17:51,"That's what they have to do when they piss stop, don't they?"
00:17:51,00:17:53,That's why sometimes they take away the lollipop
00:17:53,00:17:55,and the guy doesn't immediately drive off.
00:17:55,00:17:56,It's 'cause he's just shaking.
00:17:56,00:17:57,"- He's just having a, wow."
00:17:57,00:17:59,I never knew how actually skilled these guys were
00:17:59,00:18:02,that they could manage to drive that while pissing.
00:18:02,00:18:03,- A lot of the crashes are because
00:18:03,00:18:05,they put their hand on the wrong thing.
00:18:05,00:18:07,(laughing)
00:18:07,00:18:11,"- No, but surely drivers have only mid-race, don't they?"
00:18:11,00:18:12,- I think it's a good question
00:18:12,00:18:13,'cause there are quite a long races on my car.
00:18:13,00:18:14,"- They're really long and they have to drink,"
00:18:14,00:18:15,they have to take in fluids.
00:18:15,00:18:16,- But we don't know the answer.
00:18:16,00:18:18,I think the truth is we don't know the answer here.
00:18:18,00:18:19,"- Yeah, I think you would,"
00:18:19,00:18:20,"yeah, I don't think it'd be illegal."
00:18:20,00:18:21,- I can tell you that if you're--
00:18:21,00:18:25,"- Just a very, very few races are lost"
00:18:25,00:18:27,because someone's having a shit in the foot well.
00:18:27,00:18:29,I think that's fair.
00:18:29,00:18:30,- Almost never happens.
00:18:30,00:18:32,- There's no Paul O'Rike Cliff or Formula One racing.
00:18:32,00:18:35,- Is the person you were talking about
00:18:35,00:18:37,was his name Max Verstappen?
00:18:37,00:18:40,"- No, so no, I was talking about Kimmy Antonelli."
00:18:40,00:18:42,Max Verstappen is the greatest driver ever
00:18:42,00:18:44,of the last 10 years.
00:18:44,00:18:45,- Belgian?
00:18:45,00:18:46,"- Yeah, he's won everything."
00:18:46,00:18:47,- I thought he was Dutch.
00:18:47,00:18:48,"- Sorry, I've never heard of him before."
00:18:48,00:18:51,"He's a bunch of years ago, he was a 17 year old kid."
00:18:51,00:18:53,"- Years ago he was 17, yes."
00:18:53,00:18:57,- Racing for the F1 didn't have an actual driver's license
00:18:57,00:18:58,back in Belgium.
00:18:58,00:19:00,"So he could race the F1, but when he got back home,"
00:19:00,00:19:03,he needed an adult with a license sitting with him
00:19:03,00:19:04,in the car while he was on his learners
00:19:04,00:19:05,in order to drive.
00:19:05,00:19:07,"Yeah, so that was his two worlds."
00:19:07,00:19:08,- That's so funny.
00:19:08,00:19:10,- I can imagine it would be very hard
00:19:10,00:19:12,to transfer between the two.
00:19:12,00:19:13,"- Yeah, and you do get in trouble"
00:19:13,00:19:15,if you drive like you're a Formula One driver
00:19:15,00:19:16,on it through a town.
00:19:16,00:19:17,- Exactly.
00:19:17,00:19:19,"- And rally driving, you can be banned."
00:19:19,00:19:20,There was a rally driver called Colin McRae
00:19:20,00:19:22,"who was banned in the '90s,"
00:19:22,00:19:25,but he actually could get a license.
00:19:25,00:19:27,"And if you lose your license here,"
00:19:27,00:19:28,you can get a license to compete
00:19:28,00:19:30,in competitive sports racing in another country.
00:19:30,00:19:32,"So he got a license in Monaco,"
00:19:32,00:19:34,even though he was banned for drink driving or speeding here.
00:19:34,00:19:35,"And then he came back,"
00:19:35,00:19:39,competed in rally driving races in Wales in 2002
00:19:39,00:19:40,without a license.
00:19:40,00:19:42,But rally driving is half public roads
00:19:42,00:19:43,"and half private roads,"
00:19:43,00:19:44,even though they shut them all.
00:19:44,00:19:46,"On the public roads,"
00:19:46,00:19:48,he had to swap with his co-driver
00:19:48,00:19:49,'cause he didn't have a license
00:19:49,00:19:52,to drive on public roads in the UK.
00:19:52,00:19:53,- Do they have to stop and get out?
00:19:53,00:19:54,- I can't find this out.
00:19:54,00:19:55,"If anyone watched it,"
00:19:55,00:19:57,I can't find out if they stop and they--
00:19:57,00:19:58,- 'Cause that would slow you down enough
00:19:58,00:19:59,"to lose the race, I'm sure."
00:19:59,00:20:02,- There's got to be a Batman style chair swap
00:20:02,00:20:04,that can happen internally in the car
00:20:04,00:20:05,that you build in.
00:20:05,00:20:07,- Or one of those driving instructor cars
00:20:07,00:20:08,which have dual controls.
00:20:08,00:20:10,"Yeah, but then you're driving on the wrong side of the car."
00:20:10,00:20:12,You're suddenly in an English car in Europe.
00:20:12,00:20:13,"- Oh, that doesn't matter."
00:20:13,00:20:14,Like a left and right hand drive.
00:20:14,00:20:16,That's not going to make a big difference.
00:20:16,00:20:17,"- If you're a good driver,"
00:20:17,00:20:18,you thought you could handle that.
00:20:18,00:20:19,- You'll find all this out
00:20:19,00:20:20,when you have your first lesson down.
00:20:20,00:20:21,Don't worry about it.
00:20:21,00:20:23,"You know, Norway,"
00:20:23,00:20:26,"it is very, very, very electric in its cars, right?"
00:20:26,00:20:28,99% of new cars sales are electric.
00:20:28,00:20:31,"The reason this has happened is,"
00:20:31,00:20:34,"in part, thanks to the band A-Ha."
00:20:34,00:20:35,- A-Ha?
00:20:35,00:20:36,"- No, A-Ha."
00:20:36,00:20:38,- A-Ha.
00:20:38,00:20:39,(laughing)
00:20:39,00:20:41,- We could dance this dance all day.
00:20:41,00:20:43,I find this absolutely mad.
00:20:43,00:20:45,"This is an amazing story, right?"
00:20:45,00:20:48,"They bought, I think, the first electric car in Norway,"
00:20:48,00:20:49,"back in the '80s,"
00:20:49,00:20:52,when electric cars were really not a thing.
00:20:52,00:20:53,They bought it at a conference in Switzerland.
00:20:53,00:20:55,"It was a converted Fiat Panda,"
00:20:55,00:20:57,which had been converted to run on batteries.
00:20:57,00:20:59,"And two of the guys from A-Ha,"
00:20:59,00:21:00,they just thought it was very cool.
00:21:00,00:21:03,They drove it from the conference back to Norway.
00:21:03,00:21:04,"And when they got it back,"
00:21:04,00:21:07,they found there was no way of legally registering it
00:21:07,00:21:09,because Norway's traffic ministry
00:21:09,00:21:12,or whatever couldn't compute an electric car.
00:21:12,00:21:13,"And Norway has loads of toll roads, right?"
00:21:13,00:21:16,"So they would drive it through the tolls,"
00:21:16,00:21:17,that they would be fined
00:21:17,00:21:18,"because they hadn't registered their car,"
00:21:18,00:21:20,but they couldn't register their car.
00:21:20,00:21:21,So they'd get the fine.
00:21:21,00:21:22,They wouldn't pay the fine.
00:21:22,00:21:24,They kept driving through the toll roads.
00:21:24,00:21:25,"Eventually, the car was confiscated."
00:21:25,00:21:26,It went to a police auction
00:21:26,00:21:28,where they bought the car back
00:21:28,00:21:29,because no one else wanted
00:21:29,00:21:31,to convert it to electric Fiat Panda.
00:21:31,00:21:33,They did this for several goes round
00:21:33,00:21:37,"on the car being confiscated, fined, re-bought, all of that."
00:21:37,00:21:38,"And eventually, the authorities just said,"
00:21:38,00:21:40,"""Oh, fine, we'll just abolish road tolls"
00:21:40,00:21:41,"""for electric cars."""
00:21:41,00:21:43,And that was a big incentive to lots of people
00:21:43,00:21:44,to go electric.
00:21:44,00:21:46,- No way! - Because we then don't pay
00:21:46,00:21:47,"the road tolls, yeah."
00:21:47,00:21:48,- Great.
00:21:48,00:21:49,- That's unbelievable.
00:21:49,00:21:49,- Uh-huh.
00:21:49,00:21:51,- Clever. - Isn't that stunning?
00:21:51,00:21:52,- Clever band.
00:21:52,00:21:54,And was that their plan all along?
00:21:54,00:21:54,- That was the plan all along.
00:21:54,00:21:56,- To solve the climate crisis.
00:21:56,00:21:59,- How many points do you need
00:21:59,00:22:01,on your license to lose your license?
00:22:01,00:22:02,- 12.
00:22:02,00:22:03,"- 12, exactly."
00:22:03,00:22:05,"Okay, that's the case."
00:22:05,00:22:07,"If you get 12 points, you lose your license."
00:22:07,00:22:12,Except there are some people who have more points than that
00:22:12,00:22:13,and still haven't lost their license.
00:22:13,00:22:16,"'Cause you can get exemptions if, for example,"
00:22:16,00:22:19,you really need to drive to look after someone.
00:22:19,00:22:21,"If you're a carer, all that kind of thing."
00:22:21,00:22:23,"Or there's another urgent reason why you definitely need,"
00:22:23,00:22:24,and you can persuade the authorities
00:22:24,00:22:25,that you need to keep driving.
00:22:25,00:22:27,And I find this stunning.
00:22:27,00:22:28,"There are 10,000 people in the UK"
00:22:28,00:22:30,who have more than 12 points on their license
00:22:30,00:22:32,and still have their license.
00:22:32,00:22:35,There is one 26-year-old from North Wales
00:22:35,00:22:40,"who has, on his license, 229 points."
00:22:40,00:22:41,"- No, there's not."
00:22:41,00:22:42,- Yes. - And can still drive.
00:22:42,00:22:44,- And still has a license.
00:22:44,00:22:45,I can't work it out fully.
00:22:45,00:22:48,"But for example, if you speed,"
00:22:48,00:22:51,"let's say a speed limit's been changed from 30 to 20,"
00:22:51,00:22:53,"which happened in Wales and some bits of Wales recently,"
00:22:53,00:22:56,"and you drive through several cameras in one day,"
00:22:56,00:22:58,you're technically speeding through all of them.
00:22:58,00:23:00,"And let's say, 'cause the postal system's a bit slow,"
00:23:00,00:23:01,you're doing that for two weeks
00:23:01,00:23:03,before the first thing catches up with you.
00:23:03,00:23:06,- What a terrible thing to do on your doorstep.
00:23:06,00:23:07,- Suddenly. - When you know.
00:23:07,00:23:11,"- Right, so like two weeks later, after commuting,"
00:23:11,00:23:15,"let's say 20 miles each way and going 30 when, you know,"
00:23:15,00:23:16,"the limit's suddenly 20,"
00:23:16,00:23:18,you're doing 150% of the speed limit.
00:23:18,00:23:20,"Yeah, so for whatever reason."
00:23:20,00:23:21,"- That's a slow post, though,"
00:23:21,00:23:25,if he's racked up 220 points before he got the first letter.
00:23:25,00:23:27,"- Yeah, but if every camera that you speed through"
00:23:27,00:23:29,"is three points, I can see it working out."
00:23:29,00:23:30,- I could just have a rack up.
00:23:30,00:23:32,My mum drove with 14 points on her license
00:23:32,00:23:33,for a couple of years.
00:23:33,00:23:34,"- Oh, yeah?"
00:23:34,00:23:36,"- Yep, the way she got away with it"
00:23:36,00:23:38,was when she should have lost her license.
00:23:38,00:23:41,And I'm not saying this wasn't justified.
00:23:41,00:23:43,Her lawyer argued that the school run
00:23:43,00:23:45,was a very important time to bond with her children.
00:23:45,00:23:47,- Oh my God. - And she would look
00:23:47,00:23:50,at his house on very important parent-child relationships.
00:23:50,00:23:51,- Are they serious?
00:23:51,00:23:54,"- Yes, she was then banned properly two years later"
00:23:54,00:23:56,"when she was caught again, but yeah."
00:23:56,00:23:58,We got that extra two years of parent-child bonding
00:23:58,00:23:59,and I thought that was very important.
00:23:59,00:24:01,- She gets your names mixed up all the time.
00:24:01,00:24:03,(laughing)
00:24:03,00:24:04,"- That's not true, Judith."
00:24:04,00:24:06,"- Wow, I'm a huge fan of yours."
00:24:06,00:24:08,(upbeat music)
00:24:08,00:24:13,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:24:13,00:24:14,and that is Andy.
00:24:14,00:24:17,"- My fact is that under their main tongue,"
00:24:17,00:24:19,lemurs have another tongue.
00:24:19,00:24:20,(laughing)
00:24:20,00:24:21,- Sexy.
00:24:21,00:24:23,"- Lemurs have two tongues, yeah, sexy."
00:24:23,00:24:24,- Yeah? - Sexy stuff.
00:24:24,00:24:25,- That's cool.
00:24:25,00:24:26,- And this second tongue is just for guessing.
00:24:26,00:24:28,"No, it's sadly not."
00:24:28,00:24:30,It's a cleaning structure.
00:24:30,00:24:32,"But it's still a second tongue, it's called a sublingua."
00:24:32,00:24:34,"So they have to think of a tooth comb,"
00:24:34,00:24:36,"which is this structure, I mean,"
00:24:36,00:24:37,it's exactly as it sounds.
00:24:37,00:24:40,"It's a group of teeth that look like a comb, fine."
00:24:40,00:24:41,"And they use that for grooming,"
00:24:41,00:24:45,"so they run that tooth comb across their fur,"
00:24:45,00:24:46,and it helps to pick out all the-
00:24:46,00:24:47,- And this is in the mouth.
00:24:47,00:24:49,"- This is in the mouth, yeah."
00:24:49,00:24:52,"But this tooth comb, like a normal comb, gets full of air."
00:24:52,00:24:53,- Yep.
00:24:53,00:24:55,- So how do you clean the comb?
00:24:55,00:24:57,You do it with your second tongue.
00:24:57,00:25:00,"- It's a sublingua, which is an undertongue,"
00:25:00,00:25:02,and it's specifically for cleaning out the tooth comb.
00:25:02,00:25:05,I don't know what they use to clean the tongue.
00:25:05,00:25:06,"- Oh, yeah."
00:25:06,00:25:07,"Hang on, does this mean that"
00:25:07,00:25:09,do they have to get the undertongue up
00:25:09,00:25:11,and over the first tongue to clean it?
00:25:11,00:25:12,- No.
00:25:12,00:25:13,- Or do they swivel around the top tongues?
00:25:13,00:25:15,"- No, they just sort of stick out their tongue."
00:25:15,00:25:17,It doesn't look as much like a tongue
00:25:17,00:25:18,as you and I are hoping.
00:25:18,00:25:21,"It's a small and slightly harder,"
00:25:21,00:25:24,like a more pointy structure.
00:25:24,00:25:25,But it is a sublingua.
00:25:25,00:25:28,- Are there many sublinguas in the natural world?
00:25:28,00:25:30,I couldn't really find many animals
00:25:30,00:25:32,that have more than one tongue.
00:25:32,00:25:35,- I'd be surprised just because lemurs are so weird
00:25:35,00:25:36,"because they're on Madagascar,"
00:25:36,00:25:39,"and Madagascar is evolutionarily really quite separate,"
00:25:39,00:25:41,because it's split off from Africa
00:25:41,00:25:44,and then from the Asian subcontinent.
00:25:44,00:25:47,"90 million years ago, 180 million years,"
00:25:47,00:25:47,it split from Africa.
00:25:47,00:25:49,"Then 90 million years later, India left,"
00:25:49,00:25:51,"and it's just, Madagascar's just left there"
00:25:51,00:25:53,hanging out for weird stuff to evolve.
00:25:53,00:25:54,"- So that's amazing,"
00:25:54,00:25:56,because it's something like 80% of the animals
00:25:56,00:25:59,"that live there are just there,"
00:25:59,00:26:01,"nowhere else in the world, right?"
00:26:01,00:26:03,"- So lemurs, they all live in Madagascar."
00:26:03,00:26:05,"Well, they're all from Madagascar anyway."
00:26:05,00:26:05,"- From, yeah."
00:26:05,00:26:08,"- I was recently on a visit to an animal park in Kent,"
00:26:08,00:26:09,"which was not in Madagascar,"
00:26:09,00:26:11,"but they did have lemurs, and it was amazing."
00:26:11,00:26:11,They're so cool.
00:26:11,00:26:12,"There are more than 100 species,"
00:26:12,00:26:14,"and they're all native to Madagascar,"
00:26:14,00:26:16,and I'm sure we'll get into it.
00:26:16,00:26:17,They're really endangered
00:26:17,00:26:19,because of mostly habitat loss
00:26:19,00:26:20,with a bit of climate change
00:26:20,00:26:22,and also human hunting thrown in.
00:26:22,00:26:23,"So many of them are really threatened,"
00:26:23,00:26:26,but they're absolutely unbelievable creatures.
00:26:26,00:26:26,They're so cool.
00:26:26,00:26:29,"- They are, and every single one of them"
00:26:29,00:26:31,seems to have their own unique thing
00:26:31,00:26:33,that's interesting about them.
00:26:33,00:26:36,"We've spoken about this before on the podcast,"
00:26:36,00:26:38,but a few of them are quite solitary animals.
00:26:38,00:26:40,"So even within their family,"
00:26:40,00:26:41,they will barely see each other.
00:26:41,00:26:43,And the only way they have any kind of communication
00:26:43,00:26:45,with each other is by having a pissing tree.
00:26:45,00:26:48,So they will go down at different times.
00:26:48,00:26:50,It's like if you live in a big house
00:26:50,00:26:52,with a lot of siblings and there's one toilet.
00:26:52,00:26:55,"You know, it's like eight, 15 in the morning,"
00:26:55,00:26:56,that's my slot.
00:26:56,00:26:58,"So they go at different times and they will pee,"
00:26:58,00:27:00,"and they have a unique fingerprint, as it were,"
00:27:00,00:27:03,"with their urine, which means that if I was going,"
00:27:03,00:27:06,"I'd be like, ""Handy's been, okay, I can smell."""
00:27:06,00:27:08,- And what does that tell you
00:27:08,00:27:09,about what you're gonna do next?
00:27:09,00:27:11,"Is that like, oh, he must be near Biogo to see him,"
00:27:11,00:27:13,or quite kind? - It means they're okay.
00:27:13,00:27:14,It's like a checking in.
00:27:14,00:27:15,"It's just like sending a WhatsApp to say,"
00:27:15,00:27:16,"""Hey, hope you're well."""
00:27:16,00:27:18,"It's like, ""Oh, I know they're doing okay."""
00:27:18,00:27:20,- But they just never wanna pee at the same time together.
00:27:20,00:27:22,"- No, they don't wanna see each other."
00:27:22,00:27:23,- They have no interest. - That's very nice.
00:27:23,00:27:26,I personally like to have the bathroom to myself as well.
00:27:26,00:27:28,"I'm funny in an old-fashioned like that, but..."
00:27:28,00:27:29,- I invite the family.
00:27:29,00:27:34,"Lemurs, yeah, lemurs very weird."
00:27:34,00:27:37,"Ring-tailed lemurs, the sort of big ones, the famous ones,"
00:27:37,00:27:40,and they make their own perfume.
00:27:40,00:27:44,So it's not just about secreting one scent.
00:27:44,00:27:48,"They secrete, apparently, a strong but short-lived scent"
00:27:48,00:27:48,in their wrists.
00:27:48,00:27:52,"So, you know, odor-toilet doesn't last very long."
00:27:52,00:27:53,- Okay.
00:27:53,00:27:54,"- So there's like an odor-toilet in their wrists,"
00:27:54,00:27:58,and then they secrete a very long-lasting different scent
00:27:58,00:28:00,"from their shoulder glands, like an odor-parfum."
00:28:00,00:28:04,"And then they get their tails, and they dab their shoulders,"
00:28:04,00:28:06,and they dab their wrists to mix the scents together
00:28:06,00:28:11,in what's known as a wrist-to-pit move in zoology.
00:28:11,00:28:13,"And then they've got a perfume,"
00:28:13,00:28:14,and then they waft it in the air.
00:28:14,00:28:15,- The tail?
00:28:15,00:28:16,- They waft their tail in the air.
00:28:16,00:28:17,Now they've mixed up the perfume.
00:28:17,00:28:19,"- And that's their mating ritual,"
00:28:19,00:28:20,or is that just general day-to-day?
00:28:20,00:28:24,"- It's mating, and it's so clever, because it's telling,"
00:28:24,00:28:25,"I mean, I can't believe,"
00:28:25,00:28:26,"sometimes I wonder if I'm making this up,"
00:28:26,00:28:30,"but it's telling females their genetic makeup,"
00:28:30,00:28:31,"and the females smell it, and they know"
00:28:31,00:28:33,"if the male is too similar to them,"
00:28:33,00:28:36,'cause obviously you want maximum genetic diversity
00:28:36,00:28:38,"for your kids, so you sniff their perfume,"
00:28:38,00:28:41,"and it's like, ""I also use Chanel."""
00:28:41,00:28:41,- Get out.
00:28:41,00:28:44,- Then you're going to shag someone else.
00:28:44,00:28:45,"- I don't suppose, at any point,"
00:28:45,00:28:49,you read about the northern giant mouse lemur.
00:28:49,00:28:50,- No.
00:28:50,00:28:55,"- Okay, this is another standout in the lemur tribe."
00:28:55,00:28:59,"They've got testicles, which are the largest,"
00:28:59,00:29:02,"I believe, of any primate relative to body size."
00:29:02,00:29:03,- Okay.
00:29:03,00:29:04,"- As a percentage, then,"
00:29:04,00:29:07,what would you say your testicles are of your body weight?
00:29:07,00:29:09,"- That's a very personal question, isn't it?"
00:29:09,00:29:10,- That's so personal.
00:29:10,00:29:12,- He's just had mumps.
00:29:12,00:29:13,(laughing)
00:29:13,00:29:15,"- Of my weight, what percentage?"
00:29:15,00:29:16,- I'm not asking you to give away your weight.
00:29:16,00:29:19,I'm saying what proportion of your body weight is testicles.
00:29:19,00:29:21,- We're talking 15%.
00:29:21,00:29:23,(laughing)
00:29:23,00:29:25,"- Yeah, you do need to."
00:29:25,00:29:26,"- Dream on, mate."
00:29:26,00:29:27,"For them, it's--"
00:29:27,00:29:28,- What were yours to put into context?
00:29:28,00:29:29,- Sorry?
00:29:29,00:29:30,- What are yours?
00:29:30,00:29:33,"- I don't, I think for humans, it's kind of 0.2%."
00:29:33,00:29:36,"No, it's less than, it's much less than 1%, you know?"
00:29:36,00:29:39,"But for these guys, it's 5% of their body weight"
00:29:39,00:29:40,is testicles.
00:29:40,00:29:40,- Wow.
00:29:40,00:29:42,"- It's the equivalent of me,"
00:29:42,00:29:44,"and here's a fun home maths challenge,"
00:29:44,00:29:46,"you can work out how much I weigh,"
00:29:46,00:29:47,it's the equivalent of me having testicles
00:29:47,00:29:49,that are 3.8 kilos between them.
00:29:49,00:29:50,- Right.
00:29:50,00:29:51,- It's a lot.
00:29:51,00:29:51,- Yeah.
00:29:51,00:29:52,- It's a lot.
00:29:52,00:29:54,"And they were only discovered in 2005, these things."
00:29:54,00:29:56,"And often, as they swing through the trees,"
00:29:56,00:29:57,they will bump and bruise their testicles.
00:29:57,00:29:59,"- Oh, that's a nice one."
00:29:59,00:29:59,- That's right.
00:29:59,00:30:01,"- Oh, I've seen, my friend used to have a sausage dog"
00:30:01,00:30:04,"called Dave, and Dave lived upstairs in a flat,"
00:30:04,00:30:06,"and he had the longest dangling balls,"
00:30:06,00:30:09,"and this poor dog, we used to walk behind him on the stairs."
00:30:09,00:30:11,They would wallop the top of each step
00:30:11,00:30:12,as they were going on.
00:30:12,00:30:15,- I just see these dangling bells.
00:30:15,00:30:15,- Does he mind it?
00:30:15,00:30:17,Is it like every time he's going?
00:30:17,00:30:21,"- So Blue, who owned Dave, would show people,"
00:30:21,00:30:22,"because he would say it's okay,"
00:30:22,00:30:24,"and he would flip Dave upside down and say,"
00:30:24,00:30:26,"""Look how hardened and leathery they've become,"
00:30:26,00:30:27,"""they're okay, he doesn't feel it anymore,"
00:30:27,00:30:29,"""it's like a real hard boxing bag now."""
00:30:29,00:30:30,- That's what you want.
00:30:30,00:30:33,- But that's like so I can empathize.
00:30:33,00:30:35,But maybe they've got very leathery hardened testicles.
00:30:35,00:30:36,"- Maybe, let's hope."
00:30:36,00:30:38,But it's because they have a system
00:30:38,00:30:39,"where everyone has multiple partners,"
00:30:39,00:30:42,"male and female, and there's no mating season."
00:30:42,00:30:44,So they just need as much sperm as possible.
00:30:44,00:30:47,"- They have to produce a lot of sperm and frequently mate,"
00:30:47,00:30:49,and that's the way they pass their genes on.
00:30:49,00:30:50,It's a very competitive field.
00:30:50,00:30:54,"- See, I guess a few of the lemurs have this kind of problem"
00:30:54,00:30:55,where there's just one feature of them
00:30:55,00:30:59,"that is just oddly grown, so that it suits the environment."
00:30:59,00:31:01,"The I.I., which is probably the most famous"
00:31:01,00:31:03,of the lemurs.
00:31:03,00:31:04,- That Norwegian band.
00:31:04,00:31:06,(laughing)
00:31:06,00:31:09,- What?
00:31:09,00:31:12,(laughing)
00:31:12,00:31:16,"- Yeah, they're a tribute band, uh-huh, I.I."
00:31:16,00:31:19,They're a nautically themed uh-huh tribute band.
00:31:19,00:31:24,- So the I.I. has a tremendously long finger.
00:31:24,00:31:27,It uses the finger to get into trees and pick out grubs.
00:31:27,00:31:30,So like how hummingbirds will have a long nose
00:31:30,00:31:33,"to suck like a straw, the I.I. uses its finger."
00:31:33,00:31:35,"Its finger though is so long, it has the same thing"
00:31:35,00:31:37,"as it's walking along, it has to raise it up."
00:31:37,00:31:39,"Otherwise, it basically trips on its own finger"
00:31:39,00:31:41,"as it's going along, and it's very delicate."
00:31:41,00:31:43,"So, you know, it could sprain the finger,"
00:31:43,00:31:45,or it could do major damage to it.
00:31:45,00:31:47,"- I hadn't thought about that, 'cause it is,"
00:31:47,00:31:48,"it looks like E.T., the I.I.,"
00:31:48,00:31:51,with that ridiculously long middle finger.
00:31:51,00:31:53,"So it's about the size of a house cat,"
00:31:53,00:31:55,but its middle finger is eight centimeters long.
00:31:55,00:31:58,"So imagine a house cat, but with an eight centimeter long"
00:31:58,00:32:01,"middle finger, and yeah, 'cause you see,"
00:32:01,00:32:03,"when you see people who've got really good manicures,"
00:32:03,00:32:04,"I always think, how on earth do you get anything done?"
00:32:04,00:32:07,"But they, the whole time, must struggle."
00:32:07,00:32:09,But what's amazing about them is that they're only primates
00:32:09,00:32:12,"that echolocate, and the way they do it"
00:32:12,00:32:14,is by tapping on trees.
00:32:14,00:32:16,I kind of think this is cheating.
00:32:16,00:32:19,"Basically, they tap on trees like woodpeckers"
00:32:19,00:32:21,"until they find a hollow bit, and then the hollow bit"
00:32:21,00:32:23,tells them that that's the place where bugs
00:32:23,00:32:24,are probably living in when they eat it.
00:32:24,00:32:26,"- Oh, I thought you said cheating?"
00:32:26,00:32:26,- Yeah.
00:32:26,00:32:28,"- Well, it's easier to tap on a wall"
00:32:28,00:32:29,"until you find a hollow bit, rather than--"
00:32:29,00:32:32,"- To frown and to go, mew, do you mean that kind of thing?"
00:32:32,00:32:36,"- I thought you meant like, just like, anyone, anyone in?"
00:32:36,00:32:39,- Like the wolf at the little pig's door.
00:32:39,00:32:40,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:32:40,00:32:41,"- ""Let me in, little bugs."""
00:32:41,00:32:43,I just think it's not as impressive as bats
00:32:43,00:32:45,"who can navigate all around the world,"
00:32:45,00:32:47,and they're just tapping on a tree to find the bug.
00:32:47,00:32:48,"- To learn that, though, is pretty,"
00:32:48,00:32:49,they're the only ones that do that as well.
00:32:49,00:32:51,"- I think that's the thing about lemurs,"
00:32:51,00:32:54,is that they're all very well adapted
00:32:54,00:32:57,"to the areas they find themselves in,"
00:32:57,00:32:59,and they have also filled all the ecological niches
00:32:59,00:33:01,that might be filled by other animals.
00:33:01,00:33:04,So you were saying the I.I. fills a roll
00:33:04,00:33:05,that might be taken by a hummingbird.
00:33:05,00:33:08,"Well, you know, so on Madagascar,"
00:33:08,00:33:12,"every biological function that might fit into a food web,"
00:33:12,00:33:14,"a lot of them are filled by different species of lemur,"
00:33:14,00:33:16,"who are really, really well adapted to do that."
00:33:16,00:33:18,"But obviously, when the environment changes,"
00:33:18,00:33:20,"or when the habitat is lost, they really struggle,"
00:33:20,00:33:23,because they're adapted for one specific environment.
00:33:23,00:33:25,"- Yeah, yeah, it is wild."
00:33:25,00:33:27,"Lemurs, what does that mean?"
00:33:27,00:33:28,Lemur?
00:33:28,00:33:29,- Lemur.
00:33:29,00:33:30,- Lemur.
00:33:30,00:33:31,- I think I know the answer.
00:33:31,00:33:32,It's Latin.
00:33:32,00:33:33,- Oh.
00:33:33,00:33:34,- For ghost.
00:33:34,00:33:35,"- Okay, hear me out."
00:33:35,00:33:38,Emperor Tiberius has his toughest case yet.
00:33:38,00:33:40,(laughing)
00:33:40,00:33:41,It's a ghost.
00:33:41,00:33:42,- Something's been tapping my trees.
00:33:42,00:33:44,- So he just hangs a bunch of lemurs.
00:33:44,00:33:45,We move on.
00:33:45,00:33:45,Next episode.
00:33:45,00:33:48,"- Yeah, they're called ghosts."
00:33:48,00:33:51,"And then Linnaeus is the one who applied it to the lemurs,"
00:33:51,00:33:53,because he thought their faces looked so ghostly.
00:33:53,00:33:56,And so they are the ghosts of Madagascar.
00:33:56,00:33:58,- Do you know what else means ghosts in the animal world?
00:33:58,00:34:01,"- Weirdly, it's larvae, which I didn't know."
00:34:01,00:34:02,- Lavae.
00:34:02,00:34:06,- So lemurais and larvae are basically the same cluster
00:34:06,00:34:07,of things in Latin.
00:34:07,00:34:08,"In ancient Rome, they were the two types"
00:34:08,00:34:10,of evil ghosts you'd get.
00:34:10,00:34:10,Isn't that weird?
00:34:10,00:34:12,- Wow.
00:34:12,00:34:14,"- Yeah, we do a bit of vilifying humans for hunting them,"
00:34:14,00:34:17,"or I find in some of the naturalist writing,"
00:34:17,00:34:18,"there's some vilifying humans for hunting them,"
00:34:18,00:34:20,"which I think is completely insane,"
00:34:20,00:34:25,"because 40 to 50% of people in Madagascar are malnourished,"
00:34:25,00:34:27,which is pretty extraordinary.
00:34:27,00:34:29,- And also the early humans did not know
00:34:29,00:34:31,"they were doing this, I don't know."
00:34:31,00:34:32,"- They didn't know that, but yeah, but today,"
00:34:32,00:34:35,"like they're still hunted and eaten a lot today,"
00:34:35,00:34:36,and that's one of the things that's putting them in danger.
00:34:36,00:34:39,And it's because over half of households in Madagascar
00:34:39,00:34:42,"have understandably eaten lemur meat in the last year,"
00:34:42,00:34:44,"'cause that's the meat that's available,"
00:34:44,00:34:45,and half of them are malnourished.
00:34:45,00:34:47,"But there is this cool project,"
00:34:47,00:34:50,"which is the bacon bug project,"
00:34:50,00:34:52,"which is to farm succondry,"
00:34:52,00:34:54,which are these still very cute little bugs
00:34:54,00:34:59,"that have long, pink, trunk things on their noses"
00:34:59,00:35:00,"and like little furry backsides,"
00:35:00,00:35:04,"but they are delicious, tastes like bacon when fried,"
00:35:04,00:35:05,and they've started farming them.
00:35:05,00:35:08,"And in the pilot community where they've started farming them,"
00:35:08,00:35:10,"over the last three years,"
00:35:10,00:35:11,they've reduced lemur hunting by 50%.
00:35:11,00:35:14,"- Wow, that's great. - Which is pretty strong."
00:35:14,00:35:14,- Yeah.
00:35:14,00:35:16,- Can I give you one last lemur?
00:35:16,00:35:17,Yeah.
00:35:17,00:35:18,"This is the red-fronted lemur,"
00:35:18,00:35:21,and it does something pretty relatable.
00:35:21,00:35:23,It chews up poisonous millipedes.
00:35:23,00:35:24,That's not the relatable bit.
00:35:24,00:35:27,"Actually, none of this is relatable."
00:35:27,00:35:29,It rubs the resulting goo on its genitals.
00:35:29,00:35:31,I said it wasn't relatable.
00:35:31,00:35:34,"- No, no, keep going, this is my weekend."
00:35:34,00:35:36,- But it's so cool.
00:35:36,00:35:38,"It's because they have lots of parasites,"
00:35:38,00:35:40,"and these millipedes have toxic goo in them,"
00:35:40,00:35:41,if you chew them right.
00:35:41,00:35:43,So they chew the millipedes up just enough
00:35:43,00:35:46,"that they release this really toxic orange slime,"
00:35:46,00:35:49,"and then they slather it all over their genitals,"
00:35:49,00:35:51,"their perianal region, and their tail,"
00:35:51,00:35:55,and that kills off the parasites
00:35:55,00:35:57,"that have been preying on the lemur,"
00:35:57,00:35:59,"and then they swallow the millipede whole,"
00:35:59,00:36:01,so it's a tasty snack as well as a--
00:36:01,00:36:02,- Interesting. - Lovely.
00:36:02,00:36:03,Perianal. - Perianal.
00:36:03,00:36:05,- Perianal cream.
00:36:05,00:36:08,"- They need to work on the markers for that snack, don't they?"
00:36:08,00:36:11,- It just sounds like something from Nando's.
00:36:11,00:36:12,- Perianal. - Perianal.
00:36:12,00:36:16,"- Well, this is not lemon and herb."
00:36:16,00:36:17,This is spicy hot.
00:36:17,00:36:21,And it also seems to create a little bit of a euphoria
00:36:21,00:36:22,or a narcotic sensation among them.
00:36:22,00:36:26,They've been seen chilling out after they've partaken.
00:36:26,00:36:27,- Really? - Does it?
00:36:27,00:36:28,"Well, you put peri-peri up your arse,"
00:36:28,00:36:31,then you will sometimes get a bit of a hit.
00:36:31,00:36:34,"- Oh, it's hard when you have that flag sticking out, isn't it?"
00:36:34,00:36:41,"- Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show,"
00:36:41,00:36:43,"and despite him being on holiday,"
00:36:43,00:36:46,"James has still sent in one for us to discuss,"
00:36:46,00:36:48,"so here it is, James."
00:36:48,00:36:52,- My fact this week is if you built a house
00:36:52,00:36:54,"in a certain point of Italy,"
00:36:54,00:36:57,you can live in 10 different towns at the same time.
00:36:57,00:37:01,"Unfortunately, that point is in the middle of a volcano,"
00:37:01,00:37:05,and I am currently at that volcano.
00:37:05,00:37:06,"- Thanks, James. - Amazing stuff."
00:37:06,00:37:09,- We've never had an on-location fact.
00:37:09,00:37:11,- No. - James recorded this
00:37:11,00:37:12,at the place that the fact is about.
00:37:12,00:37:15,"- Yeah, as he just said. - Yeah, I think he just mentioned."
00:37:15,00:37:17,"- As he literally just said, just wanted to hammer it home."
00:37:17,00:37:18,- James is on a mountain now.
00:37:18,00:37:21,"- He's not on a mountain, he's on an active volcano."
00:37:21,00:37:22,"- No, not right now, 'cause this isn't live."
00:37:22,00:37:24,Sorry to ruin the illusion.
00:37:24,00:37:26,"- Anna, where is your tradecraft?"
00:37:26,00:37:27,Where is your stage ship?
00:37:27,00:37:28,- Sorry. - Huh?
00:37:28,00:37:31,"- This is very cool though, isn't it?"
00:37:31,00:37:35,"So this is that the Italian province of Catania,"
00:37:35,00:37:37,"which is where Etna is,"
00:37:37,00:37:39,"is divided into municipalities,"
00:37:39,00:37:41,"and there are 10 municipalities,"
00:37:41,00:37:44,and they all meet at the top of Etna.
00:37:44,00:37:46,"And in fact, I think it's actually split at that peak"
00:37:46,00:37:49,"into 11 sections, 'cause one of the municipalities,"
00:37:49,00:37:53,"Bronte, scoops around and nicks two portions of it."
00:37:53,00:37:55,"- Yeah, but basically it's 10, basically it's 10."
00:37:55,00:37:57,"- No, I know, but Bronte gets two bites of the cherry,"
00:37:57,00:38:00,and I think it's worth saying.
00:38:00,00:38:03,"- Yeah, Mount Etna, I had never really read anything"
00:38:03,00:38:04,about Mount Etna before.
00:38:04,00:38:07,"I assumed it was a standard communal garden,"
00:38:07,00:38:09,"small volcano, it's a big volcano."
00:38:09,00:38:09,"- It's a big one, yeah."
00:38:09,00:38:13,- It's two miles high from sea level.
00:38:13,00:38:15,"- Yeah, yeah. - That's tall, it is."
00:38:15,00:38:18,"- It's the original, it's the OG volcano."
00:38:18,00:38:19,"- What, what do you mean?"
00:38:19,00:38:22,"- Well, Etna is where Vulcan lived,"
00:38:22,00:38:26,so the god of the forge and iron smelting
00:38:26,00:38:28,"and all that stuff, Vulcan lived in Etna,"
00:38:28,00:38:30,and that's why volcanoes are called volcanoes.
00:38:30,00:38:32,"It is the volcano. - Oh, my goodness."
00:38:32,00:38:33,"And just quickly, we should say"
00:38:33,00:38:35,about these 10 points that meet.
00:38:35,00:38:38,"I mean, I gotta say, James, I don't understand this fact."
00:38:38,00:38:39,I don't know why you'd want to live
00:38:39,00:38:41,in 10 different towns at the same time.
00:38:41,00:38:44,Who you paying your council tax to?
00:38:44,00:38:48,"And so, I mean, I get that these 10 provinces"
00:38:48,00:38:50,"or principalities or towns, they all meet at the same point,"
00:38:50,00:38:52,but Etna is a really confusing place
00:38:52,00:38:54,"because it sounds like it's, you know,"
00:38:54,00:38:56,"it sounds like your child's drawing of a volcano,"
00:38:56,00:38:58,which is two slopes on either side
00:38:58,00:39:00,and a crater in the middle.
00:39:00,00:39:01,And Etna isn't really like that.
00:39:01,00:39:02,"There are dozens of craters, you know,"
00:39:02,00:39:04,and like new ones open up all the time
00:39:04,00:39:07,'cause it keeps on exploding and erupting.
00:39:07,00:39:08,So I find that really interesting.
00:39:08,00:39:11,There are more than 200 craters on Etna.
00:39:11,00:39:12,"- God, that's a lot, isn't it?"
00:39:12,00:39:14,"- I know, it's many, many miles around,"
00:39:14,00:39:16,but these places are so cool.
00:39:16,00:39:20,"So Randaco was trilingual until the 16th century,"
00:39:20,00:39:22,"which was Greek in one area, Latin in another,"
00:39:22,00:39:24,and Lombard in a third.
00:39:24,00:39:25,- Is that one of the 10 areas?
00:39:25,00:39:27,- That's one of the 10 areas.
00:39:27,00:39:30,"There is Bronte, as you mentioned, Anna,"
00:39:30,00:39:32,"which is, as we've said before,"
00:39:32,00:39:35,"is where Nelson was created Duke of,"
00:39:35,00:39:38,"Admiral Horatio Nelson was made Duke of Bronte,"
00:39:38,00:39:41,"and we think it's where the Bronte sisters, their dad,"
00:39:41,00:39:45,"he used to be called Bronte, and he renamed himself Bronte,"
00:39:45,00:39:49,maybe after Nelson or maybe after this area.
00:39:49,00:39:51,"- Which in itself is named after a cyclops, isn't it?"
00:39:51,00:39:52,Who lived there?
00:39:52,00:39:55,So the Bronte's dad is named after the cyclops.
00:39:55,00:39:58,- And Charlotte Bronte being named after a cyclops
00:39:58,00:40:00,is just so weird.
00:40:00,00:40:01,"- It's very cool, yeah."
00:40:01,00:40:04,But what's amazing is it is an active volcano.
00:40:04,00:40:06,"So like James, you know, just very happily"
00:40:06,00:40:09,took his family up there on an active volcano.
00:40:09,00:40:12,But it's not like it's just people going up
00:40:12,00:40:13,at their own risk.
00:40:13,00:40:15,The whole area is a tourist destination.
00:40:15,00:40:18,"You've got vineyards at the bottom of it,"
00:40:18,00:40:19,"where if there was an eruption,"
00:40:19,00:40:22,absolutely would be taken out by it.
00:40:22,00:40:23,"- You gotta pick those grapes fast, haven't you?"
00:40:23,00:40:25,It's the lava rolls towards you.
00:40:25,00:40:27,- Just pick the big ones.
00:40:27,00:40:29,Just pick the big ones.
00:40:29,00:40:31,- This is between November and March.
00:40:31,00:40:32,I think those are the months.
00:40:32,00:40:34,There's two ski resorts that open up.
00:40:34,00:40:37,You can go skiing on an active volcano.
00:40:37,00:40:38,"It's wild, yeah."
00:40:38,00:40:42,- Sometimes people ski alongside the lava when it's erupted.
00:40:42,00:40:42,- Cool. - That's mad.
00:40:42,00:40:43,- Really? - Yeah.
00:40:43,00:40:44,- Like racing it down.
00:40:44,00:40:45,"- Kind of, yeah, yeah."
00:40:45,00:40:48,"- And people do, people are quite annoying."
00:40:48,00:40:49,And I think they've introduced legislation now
00:40:49,00:40:51,because they do go much too close.
00:40:51,00:40:52,You're supposed to only be a certain distance
00:40:52,00:40:53,from the lava flow.
00:40:53,00:40:56,And you do have people who kind of cook their sausages
00:40:56,00:40:57,on it and stuff.
00:40:57,00:40:59,"- Look, this is Italy."
00:40:59,00:41:00,It's the land of Romans.
00:41:00,00:41:02,"People will cook their sausages on lava, you know?"
00:41:02,00:41:03,- It's not it.
00:41:03,00:41:05,And it doesn't kill.
00:41:05,00:41:06,It's incredible.
00:41:06,00:41:09,"And given how famous it is, and it's the OG,"
00:41:09,00:41:12,it's only killed 77 people confirmed in its entire history.
00:41:12,00:41:15,"- Confirmed kills, it's not James Bond."
00:41:15,00:41:18,- It's got a tally inside its craters.
00:41:18,00:41:20,- Are you sure about that?
00:41:20,00:41:21,"- Yeah, I think so."
00:41:21,00:41:25,There's this insane account from the big 1669 eruption
00:41:25,00:41:28,where reports of it that came out much later
00:41:28,00:41:31,"said that 10 to 20,000 people had been killed."
00:41:31,00:41:34,"And still you see it on places like history.com,"
00:41:34,00:41:36,"Sky History Channel, get your facts right,"
00:41:36,00:41:38,"saying 20,000 people were killed."
00:41:38,00:41:40,- We're turning into a name and shame podcast now.
00:41:40,00:41:41,- I'm afraid so.
00:41:41,00:41:43,Because there are people that you can't accuse someone
00:41:43,00:41:45,"of killing 20,000 people."
00:41:45,00:41:48,"- Tiberias could, Tiberias could and would."
00:41:48,00:41:51,"In fact, he would probably be on the scene of this."
00:41:51,00:41:52,- You're absolutely right.
00:41:52,00:41:53,"- Yeah, have them all killed."
00:41:53,00:41:54,- Blame the volcano.
00:41:54,00:41:56,- Can I check on it?
00:41:56,00:41:59,"Did you say why it didn't actually kill 20,000 people"
00:41:59,00:42:00,in 1669?
00:42:00,00:42:02,"- I think it's, I actually don't know,"
00:42:02,00:42:03,but I think it's mostly slow moving
00:42:03,00:42:05,and people just leave.
00:42:05,00:42:07,It absolutely destroyed the area.
00:42:07,00:42:09,It ruined it economically for hundreds of years.
00:42:09,00:42:11,"And still it's much, much less fertile"
00:42:11,00:42:13,because of that eruption.
00:42:13,00:42:15,So they didn't get off scot-free.
00:42:15,00:42:19,- 'Cause I assumed that it always made the land more fertile
00:42:19,00:42:21,"'cause it sometimes does with things like,"
00:42:21,00:42:23,"you know, the reason there are vineyards there"
00:42:23,00:42:26,is because the soil is so rich and volcanic.
00:42:26,00:42:28,But I guess sometimes also it's just a dead-end wasteland
00:42:28,00:42:29,that it leaves behind.
00:42:29,00:42:31,So a lot of the time it is good for the--
00:42:31,00:42:33,"- It's a fine balance, isn't it?"
00:42:33,00:42:34,Do you know you don't want to overdo the lava?
00:42:34,00:42:35,- Exactly.
00:42:35,00:42:36,"That one, that explosion, by the way,"
00:42:36,00:42:38,"is also as far as we can tell,"
00:42:38,00:42:40,the first historical recorded attempt
00:42:40,00:42:43,to divert the lava stream as it's coming down.
00:42:43,00:42:46,"So there was a town, Katania, one of the 10,"
00:42:46,00:42:48,and they dug trenches above the village
00:42:48,00:42:50,in order to divert the stream of lava
00:42:50,00:42:51,as it was coming down.
00:42:51,00:42:53,"Yeah, I mean, but as far back as that."
00:42:53,00:42:56,"- I think, I believe that their neighboring town"
00:42:56,00:42:57,"was quite pissed off, wasn't it?"
00:42:57,00:42:58,- 'Cause it went into them.
00:42:58,00:42:59,"- Well, they re-diverted it."
00:42:59,00:43:02,They put a blockage up and it went back to Katania.
00:43:02,00:43:03,"- It's like, it's like that, guys."
00:43:03,00:43:05,"- Classic, classic neighbor behavior."
00:43:05,00:43:06,- Yeah.
00:43:06,00:43:07,"- It does sound amazing,"
00:43:07,00:43:10,'cause to deal with a flow of lava
00:43:10,00:43:14,"is pretty challenging, even with modern technology."
00:43:14,00:43:17,"And when you're dealing with it with shovels and pickaxes,"
00:43:17,00:43:19,"dealing, like making a trench like that,"
00:43:19,00:43:20,it's just incredibly impressive.
00:43:20,00:43:22,They were wrapped in wet sheepskins
00:43:22,00:43:24,to protect themselves from the heat.
00:43:24,00:43:25,"It's just, it's really impressive."
00:43:25,00:43:26,- It's crazy.
00:43:26,00:43:27,"- We give the past a hard time sometimes,"
00:43:27,00:43:29,"but sometimes people are impressive, you know?"
00:43:29,00:43:30,"- No, they were hardcore."
00:43:30,00:43:30,- Yeah.
00:43:30,00:43:34,"- So if you were gonna say how tall is Mount Etna,"
00:43:34,00:43:36,the answer changes over the years.
00:43:36,00:43:38,"I find that wild with volcanoes,"
00:43:38,00:43:40,but basically off the back of certain eruptions.
00:43:40,00:43:44,"So if you ask that question in 1865,"
00:43:44,00:43:46,"it was 170 feet higher than it is now,"
00:43:46,00:43:49,because with the eruptions comes collapses internally
00:43:49,00:43:51,and it sort of goes up and down in size.
00:43:51,00:43:52,- Really?
00:43:52,00:43:52,- Yeah.
00:43:52,00:43:53,- But sometimes the act of erupting means
00:43:53,00:43:55,"that it leaves lava around the rim,"
00:43:55,00:43:57,which hardens and then makes it taller.
00:43:57,00:43:57,"- Exactly, right?"
00:43:57,00:43:59,- But sometimes it just blows the whole top off
00:43:59,00:44:00,and then gets shorter again.
00:44:00,00:44:02,"That'd be cool to solve a crime,"
00:44:02,00:44:03,"like with your national grid thing, Dan,"
00:44:03,00:44:05,"of like, but what height was Etna"
00:44:05,00:44:06,at the time of the offense?
00:44:06,00:44:07,- Yes.
00:44:07,00:44:11,"- As we say, Etna has erupted loads of times,"
00:44:11,00:44:14,200 times in the last three and a half thousand years.
00:44:14,00:44:15,- It's good.
00:44:15,00:44:18,"- Once every 17 years, it's a really good score."
00:44:18,00:44:21,I think the most recent was 2021 when it threw up
00:44:21,00:44:24,"12,000 tons of ash onto a local town."
00:44:24,00:44:25,- And so what happens in that moment?
00:44:25,00:44:26,You're in a surrounding town.
00:44:26,00:44:28,Do you evacuate immediately?
00:44:28,00:44:28,- You get help.
00:44:28,00:44:30,- It's not like Vesuvius back in the day
00:44:30,00:44:31,"where you had to guess,"
00:44:31,00:44:33,"these days, officials are there, aren't they?"
00:44:33,00:44:34,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:44:34,00:44:35,"A big government has taken over,"
00:44:35,00:44:38,"previously charming, like small government,"
00:44:38,00:44:40,libertarian pastime of surviving volcanoes.
00:44:40,00:44:43,"But the big thing they're scared of,"
00:44:43,00:44:44,all the most terrifying prospect
00:44:44,00:44:46,"is a flank eruption, apparently."
00:44:46,00:44:47,So if there's a lava fountain
00:44:47,00:44:48,"that just goes up from the top,"
00:44:48,00:44:50,"again, classic volcano,"
00:44:50,00:44:52,"that is sometimes really bad, obviously."
00:44:52,00:44:55,But the worst thing is where the site just blows off.
00:44:55,00:44:57,And that's when you get a big river of lava
00:44:57,00:44:59,flowing down the side towards your town.
00:44:59,00:45:00,It's impossible.
00:45:00,00:45:01,"- Right, okay."
00:45:01,00:45:05,- I found what I think is probably the greatest photo
00:45:05,00:45:10,"of Mount Etna erupting, taken by a local, okay?"
00:45:10,00:45:13,"It was taken in 2013, November 8th,"
00:45:13,00:45:18,and it was taken by a man called Luca Parmetana.
00:45:18,00:45:20,Luca Parmetana took it while he was in space
00:45:20,00:45:22,on board the International Space Station.
00:45:22,00:45:23,- Yes.
00:45:23,00:45:25,"- Heading over it, it was erupting,"
00:45:25,00:45:27,and he managed to get a photo.
00:45:27,00:45:28,And he's from Sicily.
00:45:28,00:45:32,"So it's a perfect local to the area,"
00:45:32,00:45:34,manages to get a space photo of it.
00:45:34,00:45:36,"Luca Parmetana, he was the astronaut"
00:45:36,00:45:39,who was almost the first person ever to drown in space.
00:45:39,00:45:43,"If you remember, he was out on a spacewalk"
00:45:43,00:45:47,"and within his helmet, the water supply got loose"
00:45:47,00:45:49,and the water started going into his helmet
00:45:49,00:45:51,and droplets went up his nostrils.
00:45:51,00:45:53,That's Luca Parmetana.
00:45:53,00:45:55,- A little bit less time adjusting your lens
00:45:55,00:45:58,and a little bit more time making sure your hood's done up.
00:45:58,00:45:59,Maybe Luca.
00:45:59,00:46:00,"- There's always a critic, isn't there?"
00:46:00,00:46:02,(laughing)
00:46:02,00:46:05,- That's an episode of Tiberius International Space.
00:46:05,00:46:08,- An astronaut drowns in space.
00:46:08,00:46:09,Tricky.
00:46:09,00:46:11,But did anyone here?
00:46:11,00:46:11,Doesn't matter.
00:46:11,00:46:14,Hang these six people for the crime.
00:46:14,00:46:15,See you next week.
00:46:15,00:46:18,"- Of course, we're referring to it as a volcano,"
00:46:18,00:46:20,and it's not definitely a volcano.
00:46:20,00:46:21,- Oh no.
00:46:21,00:46:22,- What?
00:46:22,00:46:23,- Are you kidding?
00:46:23,00:46:26,- This is according to a geologist
00:46:26,00:46:29,and he's called Carmelo Ferralito.
00:46:29,00:46:30,- Sounds legit.
00:46:30,00:46:31,- Exactly.
00:46:31,00:46:34,So he lives near it.
00:46:34,00:46:36,"And so there's this confusion about it,"
00:46:36,00:46:40,"'cause it's always burping, very, very gassy."
00:46:40,00:46:43,It belches out more than seven million tons of steam
00:46:43,00:46:45,and CO2 and sulfur every year.
00:46:45,00:46:47,And everyone says that's 'cause of gas bubbles
00:46:47,00:46:49,that are released from the magma.
00:46:49,00:46:52,But Ferralito says that you'd need
00:46:52,00:46:54,about 10 times more lava to be coming out of it
00:46:54,00:46:56,to justify all those gas bubbles.
00:46:56,00:46:58,So where are they coming from?
00:46:58,00:47:00,"So some people say,"
00:47:00,00:47:03,"ah, no, what's happening is a lot of the lava's coming out"
00:47:03,00:47:05,and then going back into Etna.
00:47:05,00:47:07,"And he says, if it was doing that,"
00:47:07,00:47:09,Etna would be inflating like a child's balloon
00:47:09,00:47:12,"every time it erupted, the lava's sinking back."
00:47:12,00:47:13,"- Which it's not, I presume."
00:47:13,00:47:15,- It is not inflating like a balloon.
00:47:15,00:47:18,- So it's not a volcano?
00:47:18,00:47:19,- It's a hot spring.
00:47:19,00:47:21,And he says that--
00:47:21,00:47:24,- I would be so pissed off with my real estate agent
00:47:24,00:47:27,if I was sold the house next to a hot spring.
00:47:27,00:47:30,Only to find out it was an active volcano.
00:47:30,00:47:32,- You've already drawn up your star plan.
00:47:32,00:47:35,- They photographed it from the other side.
00:47:35,00:47:37,So you didn't see Etna as a background.
00:47:37,00:47:37,It was very clever.
00:47:37,00:47:41,And on the viewing they kept on cunningly misdirecting you.
00:47:41,00:47:43,"I say, just come and have a look around here"
00:47:43,00:47:44,at the garage.
00:47:44,00:47:50,"I would say on that occasion, Dan, caveat emptor."
00:47:50,00:47:51,You know?
00:47:51,00:47:54,- This guy says that it can only be justified
00:47:54,00:47:58,"by it being mostly water and CO2 and sulfur,"
00:47:58,00:48:02,which makes up 70% of the volume that it's spewing out.
00:48:02,00:48:04,"- I'm sorry, I'm sure he's really well qualified,"
00:48:04,00:48:05,"but it is a volcano, isn't it?"
00:48:05,00:48:08,Because I've literally seen photos of it vomiting lava
00:48:08,00:48:11,over a wide area.
00:48:11,00:48:12,"- You know, take it up with Carmelo."
00:48:12,00:48:15,"- Carmelo, please."
00:48:15,00:48:17,- You've got to make an apias of somehow in this life.
00:48:17,00:48:18,- The town was completely demolished
00:48:18,00:48:20,by a local hot spring.
00:48:20,00:48:21,Was it?
00:48:21,00:48:26,- But everyone's skin was very smooth at the end of it.
00:48:26,00:48:32,"- Okay, that's it."
00:48:32,00:48:33,That is all of our facts.
