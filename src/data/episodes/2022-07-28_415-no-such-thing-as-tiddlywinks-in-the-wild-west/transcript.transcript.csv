00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:18,"- Hello, and welcome to another episode"
00:00:18,00:00:22,"of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast,"
00:00:22,00:00:25,this week coming to you live from Baaaaaah!
00:00:25,00:00:28,(audience cheering)
00:00:29,00:00:32,"- My name is Dan Shriver, I am sitting here"
00:00:32,00:00:36,"with Anna Tyshensky, Andrew Huntsomuri, and James Harkin."
00:00:36,00:00:38,"And once again, we have gathered 'round the microphones"
00:00:38,00:00:42,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:00:42,00:00:45,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:45,00:00:48,"Starting with fact number one, that is Anna."
00:00:48,00:00:52,- My fact this week is that the reason you can no longer
00:00:52,00:00:55,bathe in the Roman bars at bars is because
00:00:55,00:00:59,they contain brain eating amoeba.
00:00:59,00:01:02,(audience laughing)
00:01:02,00:01:02,- Wow.
00:01:02,00:01:04,"- So that, like, I was, I don't know,"
00:01:04,00:01:07,"doing like a D-rate horror film or something,"
00:01:07,00:01:10,"but yeah, it's true, there are amoeba in the bars"
00:01:10,00:01:11,that will eat your brain.
00:01:11,00:01:13,"- I must say, Anna, since you told us this fact,"
00:01:13,00:01:15,"and we got to our travel lodge, your premier in,"
00:01:15,00:01:17,"or whatever it was today, I was thinking,"
00:01:17,00:01:18,can I drink the water in bath?
00:01:18,00:01:19,- I know!
00:01:19,00:01:20,"- Oh, yeah!"
00:01:20,00:01:21,- How do we need to address it?
00:01:21,00:01:22,"- I have a question about this,"
00:01:22,00:01:23,"which is, Anna, I'd like to know,"
00:01:23,00:01:24,how do we need to address it?
00:01:24,00:01:25,"- I have a question about this,"
00:01:25,00:01:29,"which is that I have drunk the waters of Bath,"
00:01:29,00:01:31,and I don't know exactly which ones I drunk.
00:01:31,00:01:32,I imagine that--
00:01:32,00:01:34,- Just some random bath water.
00:01:34,00:01:35,(audience laughing)
00:01:35,00:01:37,"Actually, that's the problem with this fact,"
00:01:37,00:01:39,"when you try and research it,"
00:01:39,00:01:40,if you Google bath water--
00:01:40,00:01:41,- Yes.
00:01:41,00:01:43,"- All you get is someone called Belle Delphine,"
00:01:43,00:01:45,(audience laughing)
00:01:45,00:01:47,who is apparently an adult influencer
00:01:47,00:01:50,who was selling her bath water for $30 a bottle.
00:01:50,00:01:52,"- Oh, wow."
00:01:52,00:01:54,"- Okay, well, you shouldn't be bathing"
00:01:54,00:01:58,"in Belle Delphine's bath water, or Bath's bath water,"
00:01:58,00:01:59,"and it's not all the water in bath,"
00:01:59,00:02:00,"it's just directly from the spring,"
00:02:00,00:02:03,so this was discovered in the '70s.
00:02:03,00:02:06,"I hadn't realized that until 1978,"
00:02:06,00:02:07,"you could bathe directly in the spring,"
00:02:07,00:02:11,"you know, when you're in the bath, baths in the museum,"
00:02:11,00:02:13,there's that bath.
00:02:13,00:02:14,How many times do I say the word bath?
00:02:14,00:02:15,(audience laughing)
00:02:15,00:02:18,And I hadn't realized that people used to swim in it
00:02:18,00:02:20,"until 1978, and then they realized"
00:02:20,00:02:21,that coming direct from the spring
00:02:21,00:02:24,"was this amoeba called Nigleria fowleri,"
00:02:24,00:02:27,"which is also known as the brain-eating amoeba,"
00:02:27,00:02:30,"and you get it in warm, fresh water, it's very rare,"
00:02:30,00:02:32,"and like I said, it's just this one spring,"
00:02:32,00:02:34,"it's not in any of the rest of the water,"
00:02:34,00:02:37,"and it burrows into your brain through your nose,"
00:02:37,00:02:38,so it goes up your nose
00:02:38,00:02:39,"and then burrows straight into your brain,"
00:02:39,00:02:42,and it's 100% fatal.
00:02:42,00:02:44,"- So that's okay, that means it's fine"
00:02:44,00:02:46,"if you drink water, you're not gonna get it."
00:02:46,00:02:48,"It doesn't, if you drank the water,"
00:02:48,00:02:49,"if you jumped into, and don't do this,"
00:02:49,00:02:52,but if you did jump into the bath spars
00:02:52,00:02:54,"and you just took down a lot down your mouth,"
00:02:54,00:02:57,"but kept your nose out of the water, you'd be fine."
00:02:57,00:02:59,- But then if someone made you laugh halfway through
00:02:59,00:03:01,"and it accidentally went up into your nose,"
00:03:01,00:03:02,- Oh yes.
00:03:02,00:03:03,- It would murder you.
00:03:03,00:03:04,- It came out the other way.
00:03:04,00:03:05,"- What is great murder mystery, though?"
00:03:05,00:03:06,- Yeah.
00:03:06,00:03:09,What did I pay 50p to drink in about 2006?
00:03:09,00:03:11,"- That was just Evian, they siphoned it into a-"
00:03:11,00:03:13,"- No, it wasn't, it tasted horrible,"
00:03:13,00:03:15,"it tasted sulfurous, and it was strong stuff."
00:03:15,00:03:16,"- So sorry, what's the story, Andy?"
00:03:16,00:03:17,What's his story?
00:03:17,00:03:20,- I went to the bath pump rooms in 2006
00:03:20,00:03:22,"and paid 50p to drink a glass of Frank,"
00:03:22,00:03:24,"I'm sorry guys, horrible water."
00:03:24,00:03:26,(audience laughing)
00:03:26,00:03:29,"Very clever, seeing it's magic, it was nasty."
00:03:29,00:03:32,- I think this is the bit that doesn't have the amoeba in it.
00:03:32,00:03:34,- So it's boreholed now.
00:03:34,00:03:37,"So basically you still get the really curative,"
00:03:37,00:03:40,brilliant waters of bath that feed the Roman barns
00:03:40,00:03:42,"and they feed, you guys have probably been to that hotel"
00:03:42,00:03:44,with the swimming pool on the top
00:03:44,00:03:46,"that's fed direct from the spring, which is very lovely."
00:03:46,00:03:48,"And that's just all through borehols,"
00:03:48,00:03:51,so it's not coming straight from the spring.
00:03:51,00:03:52,So this amoeba is filtered out.
00:03:52,00:03:53,- Why did you drink it?
00:03:53,00:03:55,"Why was the thing to do, was it?"
00:03:55,00:03:57,"- It's advertised. - Yeah, you go to the bath,"
00:03:57,00:04:00,"you know, the beautiful, beautiful tea room"
00:04:00,00:04:03,"at the bath spa, and they say this is the water"
00:04:03,00:04:05,that people have been drinking for hundreds of years
00:04:05,00:04:07,for its curative properties.
00:04:07,00:04:09,- This is the water that hasn't cured anyone
00:04:09,00:04:13,"for the last 2,500 years, unless it's not cured."
00:04:13,00:04:14,"- What, so cure you?"
00:04:14,00:04:17,"- It did, it cured a man called Bladdard,"
00:04:17,00:04:19,who was the whole reason for the baths being founded.
00:04:19,00:04:21,"And Bladdard, he had an infection basically,"
00:04:21,00:04:25,"he had a Bladdard infection, and he was--"
00:04:25,00:04:26,- He had leprosy.
00:04:26,00:04:28,"- He had leprosy, yeah, he had leprosy."
00:04:28,00:04:30,He was exiled by his family.
00:04:30,00:04:32,"He went to Athens, got leprosy,"
00:04:32,00:04:33,"and then came back to England,"
00:04:33,00:04:35,"was exiled by his family for having leprosy,"
00:04:35,00:04:36,and became a swine herd.
00:04:36,00:04:41,"But then his pigs jumped into the waters of the bath,"
00:04:41,00:04:43,"which were coming up through the borehol,"
00:04:43,00:04:45,"and they fronked, and they got better,"
00:04:45,00:04:46,and their leprosy was cured.
00:04:46,00:04:47,So he built the city of Bath.
00:04:47,00:04:49,So that's what happened.
00:04:49,00:04:51,- And that is a true story.
00:04:51,00:04:53,- Right.
00:04:53,00:04:54,"- He's like a semi-mythical,"
00:04:54,00:04:56,"probably actually mythical king, isn't he?"
00:04:56,00:05:00,"But he was like the father of King Lear, Bladdard."
00:05:00,00:05:01,"They first wrote about him,"
00:05:01,00:05:02,the first person to write about him
00:05:02,00:05:05,was Geoffrey of Monmouth in the 12th century.
00:05:05,00:05:07,And he wrote that Bladdard died
00:05:07,00:05:10,"when he constructed some wings for himself,"
00:05:10,00:05:11,and flew into a wall.
00:05:11,00:05:15,(laughter)
00:05:15,00:05:16,"- Nice one, mate."
00:05:16,00:05:16,- It's so good.
00:05:16,00:05:17,- What a waste.
00:05:17,00:05:19,"- 'Cause it sounds like the wings worked,"
00:05:19,00:05:22,but it was a directional issue that...
00:05:22,00:05:23,(laughter)
00:05:23,00:05:24,"- It was his sat-down, yeah."
00:05:24,00:05:27,"He was like, he was a necromancer, supposedly,"
00:05:27,00:05:30,"and so he kind of, he got the, you know,"
00:05:30,00:05:32,"the devil to make him wings, and stuff like that."
00:05:32,00:05:33,- Wow.
00:05:33,00:05:34,"- That was cool, eh?"
00:05:34,00:05:35,- That was really cool.
00:05:35,00:05:36,"- So, just very quickly,"
00:05:36,00:05:38,"because I think a lot of, you know, we're in Bath,"
00:05:38,00:05:40,"and so everyone here knows what we're talking about,"
00:05:40,00:05:42,"but we do have a lot of overseas listeners,"
00:05:42,00:05:45,"and I know it is famous, but these were Roman baths."
00:05:45,00:05:46,"These were built by the Romans,"
00:05:46,00:05:48,and they used to go in every single day.
00:05:48,00:05:49,They used to swim.
00:05:49,00:05:51,"There was an, in the city as well."
00:05:51,00:05:52,There's been festivals.
00:05:52,00:05:55,"It's a big deal that, after the back of the '70s,"
00:05:55,00:05:57,"no one can swim because of this amoeba,"
00:05:57,00:06:00,"because that was, the city is literally named for it."
00:06:00,00:06:01,It's called Bath for it.
00:06:01,00:06:04,"And, apparently, the reason that this amoeba came around"
00:06:04,00:06:07,"is because there used to be a roof over it,"
00:06:07,00:06:09,and the roof has gone now.
00:06:09,00:06:12,And so the sunlight has caused for this amoeba to find itself.
00:06:12,00:06:17,"This is what I read on a tweet, and, wow."
00:06:17,00:06:18,But it was from a tweet from someone
00:06:18,00:06:20,who felt like they knew what they were talking about.
00:06:20,00:06:22,"You know, there was a solid hashtag next to it,"
00:06:22,00:06:24,"and it was a historian,"
00:06:24,00:06:26,"but supposedly there was a big roof that was over it,"
00:06:26,00:06:27,and because that's not--
00:06:27,00:06:28,"- So what do the roof, the roof--"
00:06:28,00:06:29,"- Stop the sunlight,"
00:06:29,00:06:31,and the sunlight is what was attracting the amoeba.
00:06:31,00:06:32,"- Wow, 'cause they-- - I see."
00:06:32,00:06:33,"- Well, they say that the sunlight"
00:06:33,00:06:35,"is the best disinfectant, don't they?"
00:06:35,00:06:36,"But except in this case,"
00:06:36,00:06:39,when it causes a fatal brain-eating amoeba.
00:06:39,00:06:41,"It's always the second half. - That's the second half, yeah, yeah."
00:06:41,00:06:43,- He's in the small print of sunlight.
00:06:43,00:06:45,"- There was a guy who, in 1999,"
00:06:45,00:06:49,a naked man jumped into the baths in Bath claiming--
00:06:49,00:06:51,he was claiming to be Julius Caesar.
00:06:51,00:06:53,"He jumped into the baths, and he refused to get out,"
00:06:53,00:06:55,"and there was a big standoff, because--"
00:06:55,00:06:58,"- Well, he's the emperor, you can't just drag him out."
00:06:58,00:06:59,Can you? - Exactly.
00:06:59,00:07:00,"And they didn't want to go in,"
00:07:00,00:07:02,"maybe because of the amoeba thing,"
00:07:02,00:07:03,but they had to unplug it and then wait for it.
00:07:03,00:07:06,It takes three hours to drain.
00:07:06,00:07:07,"- Really? - Well, they drained the whole thing."
00:07:07,00:07:09,"- They drained the whole thing, and then--"
00:07:09,00:07:11,"- Mate, just drag him out into the steps and murder him."
00:07:11,00:07:15,(audience laughing)
00:07:15,00:07:17,Do it the Roman way. - That's too suspicious.
00:07:17,00:07:19,"- I mean, it sounds so fun."
00:07:19,00:07:20,I don't know if there's anyone listening.
00:07:20,00:07:21,"Maybe there is who remembers this,"
00:07:21,00:07:24,"but they used to hold things called the Roman rendezvous,"
00:07:24,00:07:28,"and they were held for four nights during the bath festival,"
00:07:28,00:07:29,and this was in the '60s.
00:07:29,00:07:33,"You'd pay five shillings, and it was a huge party,"
00:07:33,00:07:35,"and you'd all just jump around and swim in the baths,"
00:07:35,00:07:38,and then you'd go and dance the night away in the pump room.
00:07:38,00:07:39,It sounds so fun.
00:07:39,00:07:41,"Like, 1,400 people will go to this big old bath party."
00:07:41,00:07:42,- Sounds amazing. - Yeah.
00:07:42,00:07:44,- Someone remembers it.
00:07:44,00:07:47,- That's a screen that's 40 years too young to remember that.
00:07:47,00:07:49,(audience laughing)
00:07:49,00:07:51,"- Oh, the baths are so rejuvenating."
00:07:51,00:07:53,(audience laughing)
00:07:53,00:07:54,"- Well, that's the thing, Anna."
00:07:54,00:07:56,"You said that no one was cured from it,"
00:07:56,00:07:59,"but I've checked some local newspaper archives,"
00:07:59,00:08:02,"and apparently there was a guy called William Toop of Froome,"
00:08:02,00:08:03,who suffered from paralysis
00:08:03,00:08:07,"after getting into cold water to gather watercress,"
00:08:07,00:08:09,"and he was cured,"
00:08:09,00:08:11,and there was someone else who was bottling wine
00:08:11,00:08:14,"in a cold damp cellar for several hours,"
00:08:14,00:08:16,"and they were cured of their palsy,"
00:08:16,00:08:18,and there was someone who got colic
00:08:18,00:08:21,"after drinking stale beer in hot weather,"
00:08:21,00:08:22,"and he got cured as well,"
00:08:22,00:08:24,"so, you know, that's evidence for you."
00:08:24,00:08:25,- Yeah.
00:08:25,00:08:27,- I'm not even sure you can get ill
00:08:27,00:08:30,"from bottling wine in a cellar for seven hours,"
00:08:30,00:08:32,"let alone then get cured by a bath,"
00:08:32,00:08:34,"but maybe, it definitely does actually"
00:08:34,00:08:36,"have some curative properties,"
00:08:36,00:08:37,like things like arthritis.
00:08:37,00:08:39,"- Sorry, is that how you get watercress?"
00:08:39,00:08:41,You have to go into some water to get it.
00:08:41,00:08:43,- That's the name.
00:08:43,00:08:43,- Ah.
00:08:43,00:08:47,(audience laughing)
00:08:47,00:08:48,- I'm very interested in that.
00:08:48,00:08:49,I'm sorry.
00:08:49,00:08:50,- Did you think it just grew naturally
00:08:50,00:08:53,on the painted clay heads of those little things
00:08:53,00:08:53,you make in year seven?
00:08:53,00:08:54,"- Yeah, I thought it was just like Cress."
00:08:54,00:08:57,"It's just Cress doesn't grow in water, does it?"
00:08:57,00:08:57,I don't know.
00:08:57,00:08:58,"- Well, why do you think they cold it?"
00:08:58,00:08:59,"All those years ago,"
00:08:59,00:09:00,why do you think they cold it watercress?
00:09:00,00:09:02,I've never given it even a second thought
00:09:02,00:09:04,in my life why I still watercress.
00:09:04,00:09:06,"- Well, I'm a busy guy."
00:09:06,00:09:07,- Where do you think seaweed's from?
00:09:07,00:09:08,But just out of curiosity.
00:09:08,00:09:11,(audience laughing)
00:09:11,00:09:16,- Okay.
00:09:16,00:09:18,- The baths used to be prescribed on the NHS
00:09:18,00:09:19,until pretty recently.
00:09:19,00:09:20,- Really?
00:09:20,00:09:22,"- Yeah, yeah, they actually had a deal."
00:09:22,00:09:23,Bath did this bath.
00:09:23,00:09:25,"Buxton, which for overseas listeners"
00:09:25,00:09:28,"is another big spa town in the UK,"
00:09:28,00:09:29,had deals with the NHS.
00:09:29,00:09:31,They had contracts where people
00:09:31,00:09:32,would get prescribed water treatments
00:09:32,00:09:34,and you'd go in and be sent there for back
00:09:34,00:09:36,and joint pain and stuff like that.
00:09:36,00:09:37,"And actually in World War II,"
00:09:37,00:09:39,there were really cool pictures if you look it up.
00:09:39,00:09:42,"Oh, no, sorry, I think it's after World War I,"
00:09:42,00:09:44,"they decided that sitting soldiers,"
00:09:44,00:09:47,wounded soldiers in baths for long periods of time
00:09:47,00:09:49,would help them recover more quickly.
00:09:49,00:09:51,And you can see hospital rooms
00:09:51,00:09:52,"where instead of lying in beds,"
00:09:52,00:09:55,"there were just lines of men who were submerged in baths,"
00:09:55,00:09:57,which they had to stay in for up to 42 hours.
00:09:57,00:09:59,"- Oh, wow."
00:09:59,00:10:00,- Imagine how wrinkly you go.
00:10:00,00:10:01,"- Yeah, it's bruised."
00:10:01,00:10:02,- Yeah.
00:10:02,00:10:04,"- So the, I'm sorry,"
00:10:04,00:10:06,"bath dimension of rivals, spa town,"
00:10:06,00:10:09,but Harrogate has a spa as well.
00:10:09,00:10:10,- Ooh.
00:10:10,00:10:11,"- I don't know guys, it sounds pretty good."
00:10:11,00:10:14,"So some of the treatments that you'd have,"
00:10:14,00:10:17,these are from the '20s in Harrogate spa.
00:10:17,00:10:20,"The sulphur electric bath, sounds pretty good."
00:10:20,00:10:24,There was the beat.
00:10:24,00:10:26,- The old combining electricity with a bath.
00:10:26,00:10:27,- That's right.
00:10:27,00:10:28,- I don't feel quite right.
00:10:28,00:10:29,"- It's like another toaster, it will, you know?"
00:10:29,00:10:33,"- There was the peat bath,"
00:10:33,00:10:36,"which used fresh peat from the Yorkshire Moors in P-E-A-T,"
00:10:36,00:10:38,"you know, the peat that you put on the garden."
00:10:38,00:10:38,- Yeah.
00:10:38,00:10:39,- There was also--
00:10:39,00:10:41,- I didn't think you meant peat.
00:10:41,00:10:43,- Someone called Peter gets thrown.
00:10:43,00:10:45,"- Hey guys, I'm here."
00:10:45,00:10:46,- Fresh peat.
00:10:46,00:10:47,- Room for another?
00:10:47,00:10:49,- What about a bit of fruit?
00:10:49,00:10:51,"- But there was also electric peat,"
00:10:51,00:10:53,where they put you in a bath full of peat
00:10:53,00:10:56,and just ran a current through the peat.
00:10:56,00:10:58,"- Every patient got a fresh peat, okay?"
00:10:58,00:11:00,'Cause you don't want to have someone else's peat.
00:11:00,00:11:01,That would be disgusting.
00:11:01,00:11:03,Imagine some peat that someone else has been in.
00:11:03,00:11:04,Ugh.
00:11:04,00:11:07,So they use 25 tons of peat a week.
00:11:07,00:11:08,25 tons.
00:11:08,00:11:09,- That's a lot of peat.
00:11:09,00:11:10,- That's so much.
00:11:10,00:11:15,Do you think all the people who are called peat together
00:11:15,00:11:17,weigh more than the amount they used in a week?
00:11:17,00:11:18,"- If it's 20 tons, yeah."
00:11:18,00:11:19,- Yeah.
00:11:19,00:11:21,- By quite a considerable amount.
00:11:24,00:11:25,"- Probably, yeah."
00:11:25,00:11:26,Probably the mass doesn't stack up.
00:11:26,00:11:29,- I've been to a rival spa as well.
00:11:29,00:11:31,I've been to one in Budapest.
00:11:31,00:11:34,Budapest has the most thermal spas
00:11:34,00:11:36,in the whole of mainland Europe.
00:11:36,00:11:37,"Some more in Reykjavik,"
00:11:37,00:11:39,but in mainland Europe they have it.
00:11:39,00:11:40,"Unfortunately, when I went there,"
00:11:40,00:11:43,I'd left my swimming costume in the hotel.
00:11:43,00:11:45,"And so I thought, well, I'll just buy one when I get there."
00:11:45,00:11:47,But they only rent them.
00:11:47,00:11:49,(laughing)
00:11:49,00:11:53,So I had to rent a swimming costume in Budapest.
00:11:53,00:11:55,The good news is that the baths
00:11:55,00:11:57,are very good for skin diseases.
00:11:57,00:11:59,(laughing)
00:11:59,00:12:03,"- So it just balances out, doesn't it, at the end?"
00:12:03,00:12:04,- But can you request size?
00:12:04,00:12:06,Or is it like a school's lost property box
00:12:06,00:12:07,when you forget your swimmers?
00:12:07,00:12:09,"- I think they just looked at me and went,"
00:12:09,00:12:10,peat!
00:12:10,00:12:11,(laughing)
00:12:11,00:12:12,Very extra large.
00:12:12,00:12:17,- Have you guys heard of the bath curse tablets?
00:12:17,00:12:18,"- Oh, no."
00:12:18,00:12:19,"- Oh, this is very cool."
00:12:19,00:12:23,This is a collection of 130 Roman-era curse tablets.
00:12:23,00:12:26,"And they were discovered in 1979, 1980."
00:12:26,00:12:29,And the idea was if someone stole something from you
00:12:29,00:12:31,"in bath, you could go to these tablets,"
00:12:31,00:12:33,which were connected to a goddess.
00:12:33,00:12:34,"And you could say,"
00:12:34,00:12:37,"I want you to take over the investigation, goddess."
00:12:37,00:12:39,And you can smite the person.
00:12:39,00:12:41,"And so the idea was if they went to that,"
00:12:41,00:12:43,"the person who stole the thing might return it,"
00:12:43,00:12:45,"'cause they were freaked out that,"
00:12:45,00:12:47,"you know, suddenly a goddess was on the case."
00:12:47,00:12:49,"- It was a very low crime solving rate back then,"
00:12:49,00:12:50,wasn't it?
00:12:50,00:12:52,That was their method.
00:12:52,00:12:53,"- But it's amazing, 'cause there's one thing,"
00:12:53,00:12:54,"and they're not too sure yet,"
00:12:54,00:12:58,but it's written in sort of Latin
00:12:58,00:13:00,as how they wrote on these tablets.
00:13:00,00:13:04,But they're also written supposedly in British Celtic.
00:13:04,00:13:05,"And if it's the case that it is,"
00:13:05,00:13:06,"and they still don't know,"
00:13:06,00:13:07,"if it is the case that it is,"
00:13:07,00:13:09,it's the only example of British Celtic
00:13:09,00:13:12,that we have that has survived on tablet form.
00:13:12,00:13:15,"Yeah, so historians are trying to work out"
00:13:15,00:13:16,whether or not that is the case.
00:13:16,00:13:17,"'Cause I know some of them are,"
00:13:17,00:13:19,"and this is a really amazing discovery,"
00:13:19,00:13:23,which goes to show that Bath is the bitchiest place
00:13:23,00:13:24,known to man.
00:13:24,00:13:27,Because the only things that were found here
00:13:27,00:13:29,when everyone excavated the Roman Baths
00:13:29,00:13:30,"was all these tablets saying,"
00:13:30,00:13:33,"""I don't like them, so they stole my hair clip."
00:13:33,00:13:35,"""I want you to kill them."""
00:13:35,00:13:35,(audience laughing)
00:13:35,00:13:38,"It was all such disproportionate stuff,"
00:13:38,00:13:41,like Dosey Meadis has lost two gloves.
00:13:41,00:13:43,So this is Dosey Meadis referring to himself
00:13:43,00:13:46,"in the third person, so already a bit of a dick."
00:13:46,00:13:48,(audience laughing)
00:13:48,00:13:50,Dosey Meadis has lost two gloves
00:13:50,00:13:52,and asks that the thief responsible
00:13:52,00:13:56,should lose their mind and eyes in the goddess's temple.
00:13:56,00:13:58,(audience laughing)
00:13:58,00:13:59,Come on.
00:13:59,00:14:00,- That's disproportionate.
00:14:00,00:14:01,- It is.
00:14:01,00:14:03,- Dosey Meadis.
00:14:03,00:14:06,"It's probably thought, no, after he died,"
00:14:06,00:14:09,"everyone's going, ""No one will ever mention that guy again."""
00:14:09,00:14:10,(audience laughing)
00:14:10,00:14:12,"Well, I think we've got to move on, guys,"
00:14:12,00:14:13,to our next fact.
00:14:13,00:14:14,"- Oh, I've got one little eventual"
00:14:14,00:14:16,that someone had in a bath recently.
00:14:16,00:14:17,- Great. - Yeah.
00:14:17,00:14:18,"- Save your personal stories, Andy."
00:14:18,00:14:22,- This happened in 2017 in Texas.
00:14:22,00:14:23,This is amazing.
00:14:23,00:14:26,This happened to a woman called Charlesetta Williams.
00:14:26,00:14:28,"She was in the bath, she's 75 years old,"
00:14:28,00:14:31,"and a tornado hit her house,"
00:14:31,00:14:33,"and it ripped the roof off the house,"
00:14:33,00:14:36,and then it ripped the bath out of its moorings.
00:14:36,00:14:37,- And she was in there.
00:14:37,00:14:38,- She was in there.
00:14:38,00:14:38,- Wow.
00:14:38,00:14:40,"- She was actually, she was in the bath"
00:14:40,00:14:42,"with her 40-year-old son at the time,"
00:14:42,00:14:43,"and it was-- - Sorry, how old?"
00:14:43,00:14:44,- How old?
00:14:44,00:14:46,- 40. - 40?
00:14:46,00:14:47,"- Well, they were-- - 40-year-olds."
00:14:47,00:14:49,- They were sheltering from the tornado.
00:14:49,00:14:50,They weren't.
00:14:50,00:14:53,(audience laughing)
00:14:53,00:14:57,Who was it?
00:14:57,00:15:01,I presume.
00:15:01,00:15:04,(audience laughing)
00:15:04,00:15:06,"- Unless, as someone's called Pete,"
00:15:06,00:15:08,"in which case, completely normal."
00:15:09,00:15:11,(audience laughing)
00:15:11,00:15:14,"When they land, the tornado ripped her clothes off,"
00:15:14,00:15:15,it must have.
00:15:15,00:15:16,(audience laughing)
00:15:16,00:15:17,- Come on. - How did that happen?
00:15:17,00:15:18,- Come on.
00:15:18,00:15:20,This is very upsetting.
00:15:20,00:15:26,They were fine.
00:15:26,00:15:29,"He was, he was tossed out of the bath by me."
00:15:29,00:15:30,(audience laughing)
00:15:30,00:15:32,"Come on, come on, come on."
00:15:32,00:15:36,(audience laughing)
00:15:36,00:15:38,- The wind speed was about 130 miles an hour
00:15:38,00:15:39,of the tornado.
00:15:39,00:15:40,They didn't end up that far away from the house.
00:15:40,00:15:41,It wasn't like they ended up miles away.
00:15:41,00:15:43,They were in the garden at the end of it.
00:15:43,00:15:44,"- And were they, okay."
00:15:44,00:15:46,"I mean, does it have a happy ending?"
00:15:46,00:15:49,(audience laughing)
00:15:49,00:15:59,"- It is time for fact number two, and that is Andy."
00:15:59,00:16:01,- My fact is that there is a Spanish firm
00:16:01,00:16:04,which has six official ham sniffers.
00:16:04,00:16:07,"Their job is to poke pork loins,"
00:16:07,00:16:08,sniff them and make sure they're good.
00:16:08,00:16:12,And at most they smell 800 hams a day.
00:16:12,00:16:14,"- Well, I have a question."
00:16:14,00:16:16,Don't they all just smell of ham?
00:16:16,00:16:18,"- Well, that's to you and me."
00:16:18,00:16:19,They absolutely would.
00:16:19,00:16:21,But to these amazing experts.
00:16:21,00:16:23,"So this, you may have seen this."
00:16:23,00:16:25,"It, you know, did the rounds a bit online before Christmas,"
00:16:25,00:16:27,but it's such an incredible fact.
00:16:27,00:16:30,Is this Spanish firm called Cinto Jotas.
00:16:30,00:16:33,And it's a company that they sell hams.
00:16:33,00:16:34,And they're 150 years old.
00:16:34,00:16:36,They're a very ancient lineage firm.
00:16:36,00:16:38,They produce very traditional Iberian ham
00:16:38,00:16:40,"from, you know, pigs which have been fed"
00:16:40,00:16:41,"on special acorns, this kind of thing."
00:16:41,00:16:44,And they have trained workers
00:16:44,00:16:47,"whose specific job exclusively,"
00:16:47,00:16:48,"it's not like I do this for a couple of hours a day,"
00:16:48,00:16:50,their job is to smell the hams
00:16:50,00:16:52,to make sure they're good before they go on sale.
00:16:52,00:16:55,And they have little kind of pipettes
00:16:55,00:16:57,or little kind of jabbers to jab the ham
00:16:57,00:16:59,in four specific places.
00:16:59,00:17:01,"- And then they have to smudge it over, right?"
00:17:01,00:17:03,It is the most amazing jobs.
00:17:03,00:17:04,And some people will be qualified
00:17:04,00:17:07,"to sniff some types of ham, but not other types of ham."
00:17:07,00:17:08,- Yes. - What?
00:17:08,00:17:10,- There's more than one type of ham.
00:17:10,00:17:12,"- There is a guy who is really good,"
00:17:12,00:17:16,but he is not qualified to sniff a particular bit of ham.
00:17:16,00:17:18,- Wow. - His father is.
00:17:18,00:17:20,He hasn't yet qualified
00:17:20,00:17:22,to sniffing that particular bit of the ham.
00:17:22,00:17:25,"So they have five seasonal workers at Christmas time,"
00:17:25,00:17:28,"but there is one guy who sniffs year in, year out."
00:17:28,00:17:30,And you have to do each ham in four places.
00:17:30,00:17:33,"So he sniffs 3,200 times a day."
00:17:33,00:17:35,"- Yeah, but that's in the high season."
00:17:35,00:17:39,"Like on a usual day, he'll do 200 and going to 800,"
00:17:39,00:17:43,"so 800 loins a day, he'll do 3,200 sniffs."
00:17:43,00:17:46,"And he says even that is pushing him to the edge,"
00:17:46,00:17:47,to the limit.
00:17:47,00:17:49,That's one sniff every nine seconds.
00:17:49,00:17:51,"- Yeah, it's insane."
00:17:51,00:17:52,- Assuming the standard data working day.
00:17:52,00:17:54,"- Yeah, but if he's only doing nine seconds per sniff,"
00:17:54,00:17:57,that says to me he's not really doing a very thorough job.
00:17:57,00:18:01,"- Well, he accusation leveled."
00:18:01,00:18:02,"- Yeah, he's very proud."
00:18:02,00:18:05,"- He's called Mr. Vega, and he says the job that he is doing"
00:18:05,00:18:08,pushes him at the limit of human possibility.
00:18:08,00:18:10,"It's just, it's amazing."
00:18:10,00:18:11,It was in the Wall Street Journal.
00:18:11,00:18:12,It's just such a good piece.
00:18:12,00:18:13,It's so interesting.
00:18:13,00:18:15,"- And they do say that if you can't tell straight away,"
00:18:15,00:18:17,then you're not doing it right.
00:18:17,00:18:20,So they say it's really gotta be an immediate instinctive thing.
00:18:20,00:18:20,"- Oh, okay."
00:18:20,00:18:22,"- So, you know, really you should be doing more."
00:18:22,00:18:25,"- Yeah, they do tests where they take a smell"
00:18:25,00:18:27,"and they put it into, so let's say they'll take"
00:18:27,00:18:30,five milliliters per liter of a smell
00:18:30,00:18:32,"and pop it into some water,"
00:18:32,00:18:34,"and then they'll put it into plastic cups,"
00:18:34,00:18:36,and you'll have to then sniff the cup.
00:18:36,00:18:38,"And because a plastic cup,"
00:18:38,00:18:40,"the odor of the cup itself will take over,"
00:18:40,00:18:42,there's a sort of time limit of about an hour or so
00:18:42,00:18:44,where that starts taking over.
00:18:44,00:18:45,So the younger--
00:18:45,00:18:46,"- I think it's, I thought it was a couple of minutes"
00:18:46,00:18:47,of the smell of plastic.
00:18:47,00:18:48,"- Oh, wow, really, okay."
00:18:48,00:18:50,- Surely it doesn't take us an hour to smell plastic.
00:18:50,00:18:51,"- No, 'cause some of the smellers,"
00:18:51,00:18:53,"according to the Wall Street Journal article,"
00:18:53,00:18:54,"they take ages sniffing it,"
00:18:54,00:18:57,"but Mr. Vega, this guy who pushes himself"
00:18:57,00:18:59,"to the limit of human possibility,"
00:19:00,00:19:03,"he says, ""If you doubt yourself, you cannot do the work."""
00:19:03,00:19:04,"And then, according to the article,"
00:19:04,00:19:06,"taps himself on the chest,"
00:19:06,00:19:07,"and he says, ""If you doubt one,"
00:19:07,00:19:09,"you have to doubt all of them."""
00:19:09,00:19:11,"So he's like, ""You've got to make your decision now."""
00:19:11,00:19:13,"He's an amazing guy, yeah."
00:19:13,00:19:15,- So was this also in the article
00:19:15,00:19:17,"about Christina Sanchez Blanco,"
00:19:17,00:19:22,who's the first woman to be head ham sniffer at Cinco Yotas?
00:19:22,00:19:23,- Oh.
00:19:23,00:19:25,- Because I read that she has such a good sense of smell
00:19:25,00:19:28,"that whenever her husband buys her a gift,"
00:19:28,00:19:30,she knows what it is before she unwraps it.
00:19:30,00:19:31,(audience laughing)
00:19:31,00:19:32,- Wow.
00:19:32,00:19:35,"- He keeps buying her cowl pads though, doesn't he?"
00:19:35,00:19:37,"- Apparently, if he buys her perfume,"
00:19:37,00:19:39,he has to quadruple wrap it
00:19:39,00:19:40,so that she won't be able to smell it.
00:19:40,00:19:41,"- That's so funny, good."
00:19:41,00:19:44,"I thought, yeah, I didn't realise at first"
00:19:44,00:19:45,that you were talking about things like perfume.
00:19:45,00:19:47,"I said, I thought she'd be able to say..."
00:19:47,00:19:48,- This is an Xbox.
00:19:48,00:19:50,(audience laughing)
00:19:50,00:19:53,"- It's a book by George Elliot, I think."
00:19:53,00:19:55,"Hang on, it's one of the earlier ones."
00:19:55,00:19:57,(audience laughing)
00:19:57,00:20:00,"But this, like, the accuracy of the nose"
00:20:00,00:20:02,depends on their exterior life as well.
00:20:02,00:20:05,"So Mr. Vega, talking of perfume,"
00:20:05,00:20:07,he says he wishes and hopes
00:20:07,00:20:08,"that his wife never changes perfume,"
00:20:08,00:20:11,"because if she does, that alters his no-sense."
00:20:11,00:20:13,"Like, he went through a bit of a chaotic time"
00:20:13,00:20:16,"when he swapped to a new anti-bolding shampoo,"
00:20:16,00:20:18,"and that absolutely messed with his nostrils,"
00:20:18,00:20:20,"'cause he was like, it was so potent,"
00:20:20,00:20:22,it threw him off and he couldn't do his job well.
00:20:22,00:20:24,"- Quite difficult people to be married to, really."
00:20:24,00:20:26,"So this poor woman either, you know,"
00:20:26,00:20:28,"A, can't change her perfume,"
00:20:28,00:20:30,"and B, her husband's now bald."
00:20:30,00:20:35,"And then Sanchez Blanco, Miss Sanchez Blanco,"
00:20:35,00:20:37,"who you mentioned, James,"
00:20:37,00:20:39,"she said that her husband's a policeman,"
00:20:39,00:20:40,"and then at the moment he comes home,"
00:20:40,00:20:43,she tells him every day about the day he's had
00:20:43,00:20:45,"before he can say a word,"
00:20:45,00:20:46,'cause she can smell it on him.
00:20:46,00:20:47,- What?
00:20:47,00:20:50,"- Whether it's like gasoline from a car crash, she says,"
00:20:50,00:20:53,"soot from a fire, dander from a rescued pet."
00:20:53,00:20:56,"- God, you wouldn't risk having an affair, would you?"
00:20:56,00:20:57,- No.
00:20:57,00:20:58,"- Well, you might, if you had an affair"
00:20:58,00:21:01,"with like a butcher or something,"
00:21:01,00:21:03,"then that would be okay, wouldn't it?"
00:21:03,00:21:05,"Because all they get is the smell of the meat,"
00:21:05,00:21:07,and just assume it was off their own clothes and stuff.
00:21:07,00:21:09,"- Also, in this quite small town,"
00:21:09,00:21:10,it sounds like he's having
00:21:10,00:21:14,a much more action-packed police life than you should.
00:21:14,00:21:16,Are we sure he's not just dousing himself
00:21:16,00:21:19,"to cover his affair with soot just before he gets home,"
00:21:19,00:21:20,or smothering himself in sausages
00:21:20,00:21:22,to catch the sausage bang?
00:21:22,00:21:26,- Do you know that Wafer Thin Ham has up to 25% water?
00:21:26,00:21:28,"They've recently done a study of this,"
00:21:28,00:21:29,"and they found that like,"
00:21:29,00:21:30,"when they get this Wafer Thin Stuff,"
00:21:30,00:21:32,"most of it is actually water,"
00:21:32,00:21:33,"not most of it, but like a quarter of it"
00:21:33,00:21:35,can be actually water.
00:21:35,00:21:37,And so that means that if you have 100 gram pack
00:21:37,00:21:40,"of Wafer Thin Ham, which costs about 90p,"
00:21:40,00:21:43,"that means, and it's 28% water, say,"
00:21:43,00:21:46,"that means you're paying 25p just for the water,"
00:21:46,00:21:49,"which means you're paying the equivalent of like,"
00:21:49,00:21:51,"a five pounds for a very small bottle of water,"
00:21:51,00:21:53,that's the equivalent.
00:21:53,00:21:55,It's only eight times less expensive
00:21:55,00:21:57,than Belle Delphine's Bathwater.
00:21:57,00:21:59,(laughing)
00:21:59,00:22:02,- Gosh.
00:22:02,00:22:04,"- You know Linda McCartney, who makes vegetarian--"
00:22:04,00:22:05,"- Yeah, yes."
00:22:05,00:22:07,- Which she doesn't anymore.
00:22:07,00:22:08,"- But veggie, yeah."
00:22:08,00:22:09,- Veggie stuff.
00:22:09,00:22:11,"This is, someone sent this as ages ago,"
00:22:11,00:22:12,and I just remembered it.
00:22:12,00:22:16,"She, the factory that makes her vegetarian fake meat"
00:22:16,00:22:19,is in Fakern Ham.
00:22:19,00:22:20,- What? - No.
00:22:20,00:22:21,- Fakern Ham.
00:22:21,00:22:22,- No.
00:22:22,00:22:23,- Yeah.
00:22:23,00:22:25,"So I don't know, did she choose it specifically?"
00:22:25,00:22:26,Did she?
00:22:26,00:22:27,- That's amazing.
00:22:27,00:22:28,- Where is it?
00:22:28,00:22:29,Where's Fakern Ham?
00:22:29,00:22:30,"- Do you know, I actually,"
00:22:30,00:22:31,does anyone know where Fakern Ham is?
00:22:31,00:22:32,"- Oh, Fakern Ham."
00:22:32,00:22:33,- Norfolk.
00:22:33,00:22:34,- Norfolk.
00:22:34,00:22:34,- Yeah.
00:22:34,00:22:35,- Great.
00:22:35,00:22:36,- Right.
00:22:36,00:22:37,- Yeah.
00:22:37,00:22:38,- Wow.
00:22:38,00:22:39,- That's why we've never heard of it.
00:22:39,00:22:39,- That's really good.
00:22:39,00:22:40,(laughing)
00:22:40,00:22:44,"- Pro sniffing things, professional sniffers."
00:22:44,00:22:46,"This is a thing, and there are lots of,"
00:22:46,00:22:48,lots of different kinds of professional sniffer
00:22:48,00:22:49,all the way across the world.
00:22:49,00:22:53,So there are people who sniff armpits for a living.
00:22:53,00:22:54,"There's a man called Barry Druitt,"
00:22:54,00:22:57,who genuinely works for a firm called
00:22:57,00:22:58,"Princeton Consumer Research,"
00:22:58,00:23:01,and he's spent 20 years smelling armpits.
00:23:01,00:23:03,- You haven't explained why.
00:23:03,00:23:03,- Great point.
00:23:03,00:23:07,"Cosmetics companies send this firm,"
00:23:07,00:23:08,"Princeton Consumer Research,"
00:23:08,00:23:11,all their products which have different active ingredients.
00:23:11,00:23:14,"So he smells armpits of volunteers,"
00:23:14,00:23:16,"rates how smelly they are,"
00:23:16,00:23:18,"and then they use the deodorant or whatever it is,"
00:23:18,00:23:21,and he will rate how well it manages to mask them.
00:23:21,00:23:23,So a firm might have six different kinds
00:23:23,00:23:24,"of potential new deodorant,"
00:23:24,00:23:27,and he will assess which one is best.
00:23:27,00:23:28,"But he doesn't like smelling armpits, he said."
00:23:28,00:23:30,He thinks they're disgusting.
00:23:30,00:23:32,"- Well, you know, a job's a job, isn't it?"
00:23:32,00:23:33,(laughing)
00:23:33,00:23:34,- A job's a job.
00:23:34,00:23:35,"- You should have said it in the interview,"
00:23:35,00:23:36,shouldn't you?
00:23:36,00:23:37,(laughing)
00:23:37,00:23:38,"What they said in the interview,"
00:23:38,00:23:40,do you like smelling armpits?
00:23:40,00:23:41,"He should have gone, no, I don't, actually."
00:23:41,00:23:43,(laughing)
00:23:43,00:23:45,"- Well, if you liked it, that would actually be bad,"
00:23:45,00:23:47,because you wouldn't want a deodorant
00:23:47,00:23:48,to mask the smell of an armpit.
00:23:48,00:23:49,- That's a good point.
00:23:49,00:23:50,He needs someone who hates the work.
00:23:50,00:23:51,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:23:51,00:23:55,"- But he doesn't have to do it nose-to-pit, as it were."
00:23:55,00:23:59,He has these smell cones that he sniffs through.
00:23:59,00:24:00,"You get specific smell cones,"
00:24:00,00:24:01,which are for sampling smells.
00:24:01,00:24:03,"- And you put the pad under your armpit, don't you?"
00:24:03,00:24:04,"I think people donate. - No, no, no."
00:24:04,00:24:05,He goes into the pit.
00:24:05,00:24:06,- He goes into the pit.
00:24:06,00:24:08,- But he has got a cone kind of caught on sanitaire
00:24:08,00:24:10,of little paper cones.
00:24:10,00:24:13,"- I see, 'cause sometimes they do it with an armpit pad."
00:24:13,00:24:16,"I think maybe if they've got a bit of extra budget,"
00:24:16,00:24:19,"and there's a company called Cavern Care,"
00:24:19,00:24:22,which is an Indian cosmetics company.
00:24:22,00:24:23,And they say they have a real problem
00:24:23,00:24:24,"with women's deodorant,"
00:24:24,00:24:29,"as in they have a shortage of volunteers to donate sweat,"
00:24:29,00:24:31,"because women, in particular in India,"
00:24:31,00:24:34,women is a bit taboo to donate your sweat to be smelled.
00:24:34,00:24:35,"I actually thought that was sort of taboo worldwide,"
00:24:35,00:24:38,but apparently particularly in India.
00:24:38,00:24:42,"- In lighter news, there was a great story today,"
00:24:42,00:24:43,"which Andy showed me,"
00:24:43,00:24:46,which a dog that was lost in a forest
00:24:46,00:24:49,"was taken out of the forest, rescued,"
00:24:49,00:24:51,"because a drone held off a string,"
00:24:51,00:24:55,a sausage for it to sniff and chase.
00:24:55,00:24:57,And I think it must have been its sense of smell
00:24:57,00:24:58,"that was helping guide it, not just the visual."
00:24:58,00:25:00,- Obviously it was its sense of smell.
00:25:00,00:25:01,"- Well, you can see a sausage."
00:25:01,00:25:02,You can see a sausage in there.
00:25:02,00:25:04,- They held the barbecue on the beach
00:25:04,00:25:07,to lure the dog towards a particular bit of the marshland
00:25:07,00:25:08,to keep it safe.
00:25:08,00:25:10,So it was definitely a sense of smell thing.
00:25:10,00:25:11,"- Hang on, I thought you said"
00:25:11,00:25:12,they were hanging a sausage from a drone.
00:25:12,00:25:14,- They did a lot of things to find this dog.
00:25:14,00:25:16,- How special a dog was this?
00:25:16,00:25:17,- It's a very loved dog.
00:25:17,00:25:17,- Was it the Queen's dog?
00:25:17,00:25:20,"- It wasn't the Queen's dog, it was, yeah."
00:25:20,00:25:21,"- Speaking of dogs, actually,"
00:25:21,00:25:23,"they have, obviously you have sniffer dogs"
00:25:23,00:25:25,in airports quite often.
00:25:25,00:25:27,And there was a report in 2015
00:25:27,00:25:30,of the sniffer dogs at Manchester Airport.
00:25:30,00:25:33,"And apparently in the previous 12 months,"
00:25:33,00:25:35,they had failed to spot a single person
00:25:35,00:25:38,carrying heroin or cocaine over the border.
00:25:38,00:25:42,But they had found 181 kilograms of illegal meat.
00:25:42,00:25:45,(audience laughing)
00:25:45,00:25:49,"Small amounts of cheese, but no drugs."
00:25:49,00:25:50,- That's so good.
00:25:50,00:25:52,- There's a Dustin Hoffman quote
00:25:52,00:25:53,"that I always think about,"
00:25:53,00:25:55,which is to do with dogs as well.
00:25:55,00:25:57,And it's attributed to him.
00:25:57,00:25:58,And I really hope he said it.
00:25:58,00:26:02,"But the line goes, if a lot of dogs are on the beach,"
00:26:02,00:26:05,the first thing they do is smell each other's ass.
00:26:05,00:26:09,The information that's gotten somehow makes pacifists
00:26:09,00:26:10,out of them all.
00:26:10,00:26:14,"I've thought, if only we smelled each other's asses,"
00:26:14,00:26:15,there wouldn't be any war.
00:26:15,00:26:20,"And I don't know why, but I think about that all the time."
00:26:20,00:26:21,(audience laughing)
00:26:21,00:26:24,- I am saying that is not one of Dustin's best.
00:26:24,00:26:25,- No?
00:26:25,00:26:26,"It's not up there whether you try to seduce me,"
00:26:26,00:26:27,Mrs. Robinson.
00:26:27,00:26:29,(audience laughing)
00:26:29,00:26:30,"Yes, you are."
00:26:30,00:26:34,That's a cut scene from the movie.
00:26:34,00:26:36,"Dustin, stop sniffing her, please."
00:26:36,00:26:39,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:26:39,00:26:41,and that is James.
00:26:41,00:26:44,"- Okay, my fact this week is that until it was identified"
00:26:44,00:26:47,"by an art dealer in 1975,"
00:26:47,00:26:50,"Donatello's bronze, the Madonna and Child,"
00:26:50,00:26:53,was being used as an ashtray and a tiddlywink bowl.
00:26:53,00:26:57,"So yeah, this was Donatello,"
00:26:57,00:26:59,"one of the, maybe the greatest sculpture"
00:26:59,00:27:00,of the early Renaissance.
00:27:00,00:27:03,And he made this kind of bronze roundel.
00:27:03,00:27:06,"And these days, it's like one of the best things"
00:27:06,00:27:09,"you can see in the V&A, one of the most expensive things."
00:27:09,00:27:12,"But we think, basically, it was given to this family,"
00:27:12,00:27:15,"and then it was taken by a guy called Lord Malton,"
00:27:15,00:27:17,"when he was on the grand tour, he bought it,"
00:27:17,00:27:20,"he brought it back, and then generations and generations"
00:27:20,00:27:22,and generations of people in his family
00:27:22,00:27:24,just kind of saw it as a little bowl.
00:27:24,00:27:28,"It's kind of, it's like a candy bowl, it's quite small."
00:27:28,00:27:31,"You might not know it was from Donatello if you didn't know,"
00:27:31,00:27:33,"but then one day, they brought it to the V&A"
00:27:33,00:27:35,on what they call an options day.
00:27:35,00:27:37,"It's a bit like Antiques Roadshow,"
00:27:37,00:27:38,"where you say, how much is this worth?"
00:27:38,00:27:41,"And they went, oh yeah, it looks like a tiddlywink bowl."
00:27:41,00:27:43,"Then a few weeks, a few years later, sorry,"
00:27:43,00:27:46,"the head of the V&A was seeing this person and said,"
00:27:46,00:27:48,"you know what, that's a Donatello."
00:27:48,00:27:50,"And they brought it back, and it's completely priceless."
00:27:50,00:27:52,But they were just using it to play tiddlywink.
00:27:52,00:27:53,- So funny. - So funny.
00:27:53,00:27:56,"- That's so weird that you say it looked like a sweet bowl,"
00:27:56,00:27:59,because it sort of was.
00:27:59,00:28:02,"- It was a thing called a Desco D'Aparto,"
00:28:02,00:28:05,"when Donatello made it, which is called a birth tray."
00:28:05,00:28:07,And it's a tray that you fill up with sweets
00:28:07,00:28:10,and you bring to a mother when she's just given birth.
00:28:10,00:28:12,"- 'Cause a birth tray sounds like a tray you would give birth on,"
00:28:12,00:28:14,"and if someone showed you that tiny little thing,"
00:28:14,00:28:15,you'd think.
00:28:15,00:28:18,"- Yeah, I just thought we could talk about tiddlywinks."
00:28:18,00:28:19,What do you think? - Yeah.
00:28:19,00:28:21,"- In all the different countries,"
00:28:21,00:28:22,got lots of different names.
00:28:22,00:28:24,"In France, it's called the game of the flea."
00:28:24,00:28:26,"In Croatian, it's called jumping flea."
00:28:26,00:28:28,"In Danish, it's called the flea game."
00:28:28,00:28:32,"In Russian, it's called the game of fleas."
00:28:32,00:28:34,"In Spanish, it's called the game of the flea."
00:28:34,00:28:36,"In Ukraine, it's called game of fleas."
00:28:36,00:28:39,And we call it tiddlywinks.
00:28:39,00:28:42,And it appears that we got the word tiddlywinks
00:28:42,00:28:45,from an unlicensed alcohol shop.
00:28:45,00:28:46,- Really? - Yeah.
00:28:46,00:28:47,- What do you mean?
00:28:47,00:28:49,- As in the word tiddlywink used to mean
00:28:49,00:28:52,"a place where you could get beer, but it wasn't licensed."
00:28:52,00:28:54,And then we kind of stole that name
00:28:54,00:28:55,and used it as a game instead.
00:28:55,00:28:56,- Should we say what tiddlywinks is?
00:28:56,00:28:58,"Sorry, for the benefit of any listeners"
00:28:58,00:28:59,who are not familiar with tiddlywinks.
00:28:59,00:29:00,- Okay. - Yeah.
00:29:00,00:29:03,It's a little game where you have plastic counters
00:29:03,00:29:05,and you have to sort of flip the plastic counters
00:29:05,00:29:08,using other plastic counters into a bowl.
00:29:08,00:29:10,"And you can, you shoot a wink."
00:29:10,00:29:14,"And that's a, you have a special plastic"
00:29:14,00:29:16,"which you shoot with, which is called a shooter,"
00:29:16,00:29:17,but it's also known as a squidger.
00:29:17,00:29:19,You shoot your wink.
00:29:19,00:29:20,"And if you get it in the target, great."
00:29:20,00:29:22,"But you might fail to do that,"
00:29:22,00:29:24,"but cover an opponent's wink, which is good."
00:29:24,00:29:26,"And if you've done that, you've swapped their wink"
00:29:26,00:29:29,and they then can't wink anymore with that.
00:29:29,00:29:31,"- Well, this all sounds very clear."
00:29:31,00:29:33,- Yeah. - I'm glad you cleared this up.
00:29:33,00:29:35,- It's full of a lot of really silly.
00:29:35,00:29:37,"- But actually that thing where if you,"
00:29:37,00:29:40,if you tiddle your wink onto someone else's wink
00:29:40,00:29:42,"and they're not allowed to tiddle that wink,"
00:29:42,00:29:44,"that used to be really, really looked down upon."
00:29:44,00:29:46,"And you, like, that was really bad form if you did that."
00:29:46,00:29:49,"Now it's part of the game, but it used to be,"
00:29:49,00:29:50,"you know, you'll, if you did that in the wild west,"
00:29:50,00:29:51,you'd get shot.
00:29:51,00:29:53,(laughing)
00:29:53,00:29:56,And I'd love to walk into the salute bar
00:29:56,00:29:59,"where there's a poker game at one table,"
00:29:59,00:30:02,"blackjacket at another one, and then the tiddly-wink corner."
00:30:02,00:30:03,- And everyone's dead.
00:30:03,00:30:07,"- You know, you can also perform a boondock."
00:30:07,00:30:10,And a boondock is when you free a squopped wink
00:30:10,00:30:11,by sending it all the way away.
00:30:11,00:30:13,So that's a boondock.
00:30:13,00:30:15,- But how do you send it?
00:30:15,00:30:17,"So that's, a squopped wink is a wink"
00:30:17,00:30:18,that's covered by another wink.
00:30:18,00:30:20,"- Yeah, so you, yeah, so you, you--"
00:30:20,00:30:21,- How do you free it?
00:30:21,00:30:22,- You free it by using your wink
00:30:22,00:30:24,"to fire at your squopped wink,"
00:30:24,00:30:27,and you knock the squop away.
00:30:27,00:30:28,So you free your wink.
00:30:28,00:30:30,"However, there's another move then,"
00:30:30,00:30:33,"which is a simultaneous boondock and squop,"
00:30:33,00:30:36,whereby you boondock someone.
00:30:36,00:30:38,"So your wink has been squopped,"
00:30:38,00:30:39,"but you, you-- - But you boondock it free."
00:30:39,00:30:43,"- You boondock it free, but then your wink lands on top."
00:30:43,00:30:46,- You squop someone else in the middle of boondocking.
00:30:46,00:30:46,- You squop someone else in the middle of boondocking.
00:30:46,00:30:48,"- Yes, yes, fuck!"
00:30:48,00:30:51,"And that, for some inexplicable reason,"
00:30:51,00:30:54,is called the John Lennon Memorial Shot.
00:30:54,00:30:57,(audience laughing)
00:30:57,00:31:01,- There are so many versions of it.
00:31:01,00:31:01,That's what I love.
00:31:01,00:31:03,"So it's a big craze in the 1890s,"
00:31:03,00:31:04,and then it fell out of fashion.
00:31:04,00:31:06,But there were all these sort of
00:31:06,00:31:08,"late Victorian, Edwardian versions of it."
00:31:08,00:31:10,"So there's Tiddly Wink 10, there's Tiddly Winks Golf,"
00:31:10,00:31:12,"Winko Baseball, Battle Winks,"
00:31:12,00:31:14,which is battleships with Tiddly Winks.
00:31:14,00:31:17,"There's Pedro, where you have to get in,"
00:31:17,00:31:18,there's a clown's mouth
00:31:18,00:31:21,that you're trying to wink your winks into.
00:31:22,00:31:23,"In 1992, there was Widdly Tinks,"
00:31:23,00:31:25,"where you have to, there's a toilet,"
00:31:25,00:31:26,and that's the target.
00:31:26,00:31:27,- Ah!
00:31:27,00:31:28,- It is clever.
00:31:28,00:31:29,- Yeah.
00:31:29,00:31:30,"- Well, it started as Tiddly Winks, of course,"
00:31:30,00:31:34,and then no one knows why the Vs fell out.
00:31:34,00:31:37,"But as I'm sure you all know here,"
00:31:37,00:31:38,it was Chris and Tiddly Winks
00:31:38,00:31:42,"by Joseph Asherton Fincher, or Ass Heaton Fincher."
00:31:42,00:31:45,"A-W-S-H, I don't know."
00:31:45,00:31:47,And he invented it in 1889
00:31:47,00:31:49,and got the patent for Tiddly Winks.
00:31:49,00:31:50,"And I was trying, going through the British newspaper,"
00:31:50,00:31:53,I'm trying to pinpoint the moment
00:31:53,00:31:55,that we definitively lost the D.
00:31:55,00:31:57,And I think it's roughly 1920.
00:31:57,00:31:58,"Okay, so you're interested."
00:31:58,00:31:59,"- Oh, right."
00:31:59,00:32:01,- But it really took off again with Oxford and Cambridge
00:32:01,00:32:03,"competing against each other in the '60s, didn't it?"
00:32:03,00:32:08,"And it became a real source of pride for Cambridge,"
00:32:08,00:32:10,and they had this notorious match.
00:32:10,00:32:15,"And it was in 1958,"
00:32:15,00:32:17,"and it was a guy called Peter Downs,"
00:32:17,00:32:20,who was head of the Tiddly Winks Society at Cambridge.
00:32:20,00:32:24,"And he wrote to Prince Philip saying,"
00:32:24,00:32:25,"""Prince Philip, have you noticed"
00:32:25,00:32:27,"""there's been an article written in the spectator"
00:32:27,00:32:29,"""claiming you cheat at Tiddly Winks?"""
00:32:29,00:32:31,There was a satirical article that had been written.
00:32:31,00:32:34,"And he said, ""Would you care to defend your honor"
00:32:34,00:32:36,"""by playing us, Cambridge University at Tiddly Winks?"""
00:32:36,00:32:39,"And Prince Philip wrote back saying very politely,"
00:32:39,00:32:41,"""I'd absolutely love to, bit busy."
00:32:41,00:32:44,"""But perhaps I could nominate someone in my place."""
00:32:44,00:32:46,And he nominated the Goons.
00:32:46,00:32:48,So there was this bizarre match.
00:32:48,00:32:51,"The Goon show, which was Peter Sellers,"
00:32:51,00:32:52,"Spike Milligan, and Harry Seacham,"
00:32:52,00:32:54,it was the biggest thing on radio at the time
00:32:54,00:32:56,for the comedy show.
00:32:56,00:32:58,And the Royal Family were big fans.
00:32:58,00:33:01,"So yeah, he sent them along to do it."
00:33:01,00:33:03,"- Yeah, which apparently they tried to get the Goons"
00:33:03,00:33:05,"to play the Tiddly Winks, Cambridge had before."
00:33:05,00:33:07,"And so it was so great,"
00:33:07,00:33:08,"they managed to get to the Royal Family,"
00:33:08,00:33:11,and they had a Royal instruction to go.
00:33:11,00:33:14,"So they had to, and they played Cambridge University."
00:33:14,00:33:17,"And I was watching the video of the,"
00:33:17,00:33:20,when the umpire kind of launched the big match.
00:33:20,00:33:22,"And he read out a letter from Prince Philip,"
00:33:22,00:33:25,"which I still don't know if Prince Philip wrote it himself,"
00:33:25,00:33:27,"or if it was a bit of satire from the umpire,"
00:33:27,00:33:28,but I hope he wrote it himself.
00:33:28,00:33:31,"And the letter said, ""Give my best wishes to both teams,"
00:33:31,00:33:34,"""but try if you can to do it in such a way"
00:33:34,00:33:37,"""that you convey that I wish the Cambridge team to lose."""
00:33:37,00:33:39,(audience laughing)
00:33:39,00:33:42,"Then I had hoped to join my champions,"
00:33:42,00:33:44,"but unfortunately, while practicing secretly,"
00:33:44,00:33:46,"I pulled an important muscle in the second,"
00:33:46,00:33:49,"or Tiddly joint, of my winking finger."
00:33:49,00:33:51,(audience laughing)
00:33:51,00:33:52,"- And then in the end,"
00:33:52,00:33:54,"unfortunately, Cambridge did win, didn't they?"
00:33:54,00:33:55,- They did.
00:33:55,00:33:59,- 120.5 to 50.5.
00:33:59,00:34:00,- A walkover.
00:34:00,00:34:01,"- Yeah, it really was."
00:34:01,00:34:04,The students were in full evening dress all the way through.
00:34:04,00:34:07,The Goons were wearing yellow night shirts
00:34:07,00:34:11,with a Royal Tiddly Wink tie on that.
00:34:11,00:34:13,And the game finished with Harry Seacum
00:34:13,00:34:15,singing a special Tiddly Winks anthem.
00:34:15,00:34:16,(audience laughing)
00:34:16,00:34:18,- And it was a big deal.
00:34:18,00:34:19,"Like, this was the big moment"
00:34:19,00:34:21,for the Tiddly Winks community in the UK.
00:34:21,00:34:22,- Not for the Goons.
00:34:22,00:34:23,They had bigger moments.
00:34:23,00:34:24,"- No, they offered Tiddly Winks."
00:34:24,00:34:25,- But it was the big moment for the Tiddly Winks.
00:34:25,00:34:27,- Or for the UK.
00:34:27,00:34:28,- Or for the University of Cambridge.
00:34:28,00:34:29,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:34:29,00:34:31,"It was, but Tiddly Winks got a big moment there."
00:34:31,00:34:35,"And interestingly, so that was on the 1st of March, 1958."
00:34:35,00:34:38,"On the 10th of March, 1958, Spike Milligan in the time"
00:34:38,00:34:42,"since the match, and the next Goonshow being recorded"
00:34:42,00:34:43,"and going out, wrote an episode of the Goonshow"
00:34:43,00:34:46,"called Tiddly Winks, in which after the hands"
00:34:46,00:34:48,"of the defeated Cambridge, Nettie Seagoon,"
00:34:48,00:34:51,"who Harry Seacum played, seeks his gameful revenge,"
00:34:51,00:34:52,and the whole episode.
00:34:52,00:34:55,"So again, broadcasting to millions and millions,"
00:34:55,00:34:57,Tiddly Winks became this big thing.
00:34:57,00:34:58,"And there's a Facebook page,"
00:34:58,00:35:03,which is the official Tiddly Winks organization in the UK.
00:35:03,00:35:04,They have a Facebook page.
00:35:04,00:35:07,There's only about 400 people who follow it.
00:35:07,00:35:07,- Really old me.
00:35:07,00:35:08,- Only 400.
00:35:08,00:35:09,"- Yeah, but who thought it would be"
00:35:09,00:35:10,in the low hundreds of thousands?
00:35:10,00:35:14,"- Oh yeah, the content is slamming."
00:35:14,00:35:17,And there's a guy on there called David Lockwood.
00:35:17,00:35:19,"And he says, this is from his post."
00:35:19,00:35:21,"He says, ""Prince Philip did more to expand"
00:35:21,00:35:24,"""our noble game of Tiddly Winks than anyone else in the world."
00:35:24,00:35:26,"""I tell people that his sponsorship of the Goonsmatch"
00:35:26,00:35:29,"""of 1958 created an extensive publicity."
00:35:29,00:35:33,"""And by the early 1960s, there were more than 200 clubs"
00:35:33,00:35:34,"""in the British Isles."
00:35:34,00:35:36,"""Prince Philip continued to support Tiddly Winks"
00:35:36,00:35:37,"""through the establishment."
00:35:37,00:35:40,"""He'd made a silver-wink trophy and he backed"
00:35:40,00:35:42,"""the 50th anniversary in 2008."""
00:35:42,00:35:44,So he was big.
00:35:44,00:35:47,- It's one of those sports that I'm afraid America
00:35:47,00:35:49,has trounced Britain at consistently
00:35:49,00:35:50,"for a couple of decades now, yeah."
00:35:50,00:35:52,They're much better at Tiddly Winks
00:35:52,00:35:54,"than British people now, the British players."
00:35:54,00:35:55,I'm really sorry.
00:35:55,00:35:56,There was an article in the LA Times in 2019
00:35:56,00:36:01,about the kind of Federer and Nadal of Tiddly Winks.
00:36:01,00:36:03,"They were called Larry Kahn and,"
00:36:03,00:36:06,"oh, I think it's David Lockwood is the other one, yeah."
00:36:06,00:36:08,"Yeah, Kahn and Lockwood are the two."
00:36:08,00:36:10,"Anyway, 2019, they reported on this match"
00:36:10,00:36:12,that Kahn was playing in Cambridge.
00:36:12,00:36:14,And I'm quoting directly here.
00:36:14,00:36:17,"""He'd flown over from Washington, D.C. on economy."
00:36:17,00:36:20,"""Nobody asked for an autograph or to pose for a selfie."
00:36:20,00:36:22,"""Kahn's privacy hasn't been invaded"
00:36:22,00:36:24,"""by being the most successful Tiddly Winks player"
00:36:24,00:36:25,"""of all time."
00:36:25,00:36:27,"""The man who was officiating the match he played"
00:36:27,00:36:28,"""in Cambridge, quoting here,"
00:36:28,00:36:32,"""emailed the members of the English Tiddly Winks Association"
00:36:32,00:36:33,"""to encourage them to come and watch."
00:36:33,00:36:37,"""In the following five hours of play, nobody did."""
00:36:37,00:36:41,And that's him emailing the English Tiddly Winks Association.
00:36:41,00:36:44,"If they're not turning up, I know."
00:36:44,00:36:46,That's sad. I think one of the reasons is
00:36:46,00:36:49,because it used to be illegal to play Tiddly Winks
00:36:49,00:36:52,in the UK in a pub without a licence.
00:36:52,00:36:53,-What? -No.
00:36:53,00:36:55,In the UK in a pub without a licence.
00:36:55,00:36:56,-Wow. -Yeah.
00:36:56,00:36:58,So there was a Tiddly Winks match.
00:36:58,00:37:00,"In fact, it was a marathon."
00:37:00,00:37:04,The Tiddly Winks marathon over 15 yards at the York Beer Festival
00:37:04,00:37:07,"on the 3rd of November, 1970."
00:37:07,00:37:09,And this was supposed to take place.
00:37:09,00:37:11,This was an article in the Daily Mirror that I found.
00:37:11,00:37:14,"But it was called off because the police rang up and said,"
00:37:14,00:37:16,"""No, it's illegal to do that without a licence."""
00:37:16,00:37:19,"Was this a gambling thing, or is it dangerous?"
00:37:19,00:37:21,It was for money.
00:37:21,00:37:23,"It was for charity, they were doing it."
00:37:23,00:37:25,"And they said, ""There's certain games"
00:37:25,00:37:28,"""that you're allowed to do in pubs if there's money involved."""
00:37:28,00:37:30,And Tiddly Winks wasn't on that list.
00:37:30,00:37:32,And so they weren't allowed to do it.
00:37:32,00:37:34,And so they replaced it with a marathon of blowing peas
00:37:34,00:37:36,through a straw.
00:37:36,00:37:41,Hang on. And that was on the list of things you were allowed to do in pubs.
00:37:41,00:37:44,-Wasn't counted as a spot. -I see.
00:37:44,00:37:48,"Actually, there is a genuine crisis in the world of Tiddly Winks happening now,"
00:37:48,00:37:50,and it's that there is a massive wink shortage.
00:37:50,00:37:54,And it's a problem because most of the winks that are being used these days
00:37:54,00:37:56,were made a long time ago.
00:37:56,00:37:58,There are not firms making Tiddly Winks these days.
00:37:58,00:38:01,"So even the Cambridge match I just mentioned from 2019,"
00:38:01,00:38:03,they'd be using 1980s winks.
00:38:03,00:38:04,-No. -Yeah.
00:38:04,00:38:06,-Really? -What were we using with Tiddly Winks?
00:38:06,00:38:09,"My winks weren't from the 1980s, and I was using them."
00:38:09,00:38:11,"The supplier has gone bust, so this is a problem."
00:38:11,00:38:14,And there are hopes that 3D printing will save the day.
00:38:14,00:38:17,-Right. -Fingers crossed.
00:38:17,00:38:21,"Well, I don't know if it is as young and vibrant as one might want it to be,"
00:38:21,00:38:24,"because if you look at the list of Tiddly Winks champions,"
00:38:24,00:38:26,I think you mentioned Lockwood and Kahn.
00:38:26,00:38:30,I would say they are more the Djokovic Nadal and the Nadal Federer
00:38:30,00:38:33,"are Kahn and Patrick Barry, the British..."
00:38:33,00:38:35,So who's the guy who doesn't like vaccines?
00:38:35,00:38:36,Yeah.
00:38:36,00:38:42,"Look, they're all very well vaccinated, and it's social distance matches,"
00:38:42,00:38:44,and I have no idea.
00:38:44,00:38:48,"But basically, Patrick Barry is a British chemical engineering lecturer at Cambridge,"
00:38:48,00:38:54,and he has been playing Larry Kahn on and off since they first met in 1995.
00:38:54,00:38:56,-Right. -So that's a good 26 years.
00:38:56,00:39:00,"Even in 1995, Kahn had been going for 15 years,"
00:39:00,00:39:03,"so he's basically been going for 40 years, this guy."
00:39:03,00:39:06,"They need fresh blood, I think, in the Tiddly Winks game."
00:39:06,00:39:10,"Yeah, maybe. Patrick Barry is sponsored by a type of whiskey, isn't he?"
00:39:10,00:39:13,"Yeah, basically, the whiskey company have decided"
00:39:13,00:39:19,that they don't want to sponsor Cristiana Ronaldo or Federer on Nadal or anyone like that.
00:39:19,00:39:22,"They want a real person who is passionate about their spot,"
00:39:22,00:39:27,"and so they found Patrick Barry, who is the world's singles champion at Tiddly Winks."
00:39:27,00:39:35,Is it possible they looked at the cost of getting Federer to be sponsored to sponsor the whiskey?
00:39:35,00:39:40,"If you look at this 24-year-old whiskey from Cameron Bridge grain distillery,"
00:39:40,00:39:43,it has a picture of the Tiddly Winks champion on the label.
00:39:43,00:39:45,-Amazing. -Awesome.
00:39:45,00:39:49,"Apparently, it has waves of vanilla, peppery spiciness,"
00:39:49,00:39:52,and the taste of pencil shavings.
00:39:52,00:39:53,Mmm.
00:39:53,00:39:56,"I think it's really exciting that this exists, and I think there should be."
00:39:56,00:40:00,"When you read the Facebook page, and if you ever get a chance,"
00:40:00,00:40:03,"I encourage everyone listening to go and check out Newswink,"
00:40:03,00:40:06,the newsletter by the official Tiddly Winks.
00:40:06,00:40:08,-Have you read Winking World? That's another one? -No.
00:40:08,00:40:11,-I haven't even gone there. -Winking World is another very good one.
00:40:11,00:40:16,They recently ran a 12-page biography of Alan Dean.
00:40:16,00:40:21,"-No. How did they confine that to 12 pages? -Wait, I know."
00:40:21,00:40:23,"It's a genuine... Winking World 101 said,"
00:40:23,00:40:26,"""Most of your comments on WW100 were broadly the same."
00:40:26,00:40:30,"""This is all very well, but why isn't there a 12-page biography of Alan Dean?"
00:40:30,00:40:33,"""Well, dear reader, I aim to please."""
00:40:33,00:40:36,And there was a 12-page biography of Alan Dean.
00:40:36,00:40:40,"It is time for our final fact of the show, and that is my fact."
00:40:40,00:40:46,My fact this week is that there is such a thing as bendy rocks.
00:40:46,00:40:48,Mmm.
00:40:48,00:40:51,"But this is, I mean, it sounds bullshit, but it's true."
00:40:51,00:40:53,"There are genuine bendy rocks in the world,"
00:40:53,00:40:56,"so there is a sandstone, it's called Itacolomite,"
00:40:56,00:40:58,and it's not found in many places in the world.
00:40:58,00:41:01,"You get it in Brazil, you get it in North Carolina,"
00:41:01,00:41:04,"you get it in Georgia, there's a town in India,"
00:41:04,00:41:06,"you get it... I'm sure it's other places,"
00:41:06,00:41:09,but they've only been found in sparse areas around the world.
00:41:09,00:41:13,And this is a rock where basically you should watch videos online.
00:41:13,00:41:18,It wobbles when it's held on either side in a way that rocks don't.
00:41:18,00:41:19,And it's because...
00:41:19,00:41:21,(LAUGHTER)
00:41:21,00:41:24,"It's because in the inside of the rock, there's quartz,"
00:41:24,00:41:26,"and there's these interlinking bits,"
00:41:26,00:41:29,these interlocking sort of bendy bits inside
00:41:29,00:41:31,"that hold the quartz together, and there's voids in them,"
00:41:31,00:41:35,which means there's bits of space where they just find themselves
00:41:35,00:41:36,"having a bit of flexibility,"
00:41:36,00:41:39,but there's enough of them that the whole thing can bend.
00:41:39,00:41:42,"So it's not like if you're walking along the mountain,"
00:41:42,00:41:44,you're on jelly the whole time.
00:41:44,00:41:46,"It's not like that. You have to get quite a thin slab,"
00:41:46,00:41:48,and then you can see it wobble a little bit.
00:41:48,00:41:50,"Yeah, exactly. Yeah, and it's just..."
00:41:50,00:41:53,"You know, if there was one thing we were certain of in life,"
00:41:53,00:41:55,is that rocks don't bend.
00:41:55,00:41:56,(LAUGHTER)
00:41:56,00:41:59,So I was fascinated to learn that they actually do.
00:41:59,00:42:04,"And actually, interestingly, it turns out all rocks bend."
00:42:04,00:42:07,They just don't do it as quickly as old bendy may over here.
00:42:07,00:42:09,"What they do is, if you see..."
00:42:09,00:42:13,"And you can see rocks all over through, like, even on the side of cliffs,"
00:42:13,00:42:17,where you notice that they have this kind of bend in them.
00:42:17,00:42:20,"Over many millions of years. Exactly, but over millions of years."
00:42:20,00:42:23,"A pressure, if there's a pressure on the side of a rock,"
00:42:23,00:42:25,it will slowly bend to the pressure.
00:42:25,00:42:28,"Yes, it takes thousands, if not millions of years,"
00:42:28,00:42:30,but if you've got the time...
00:42:30,00:42:31,(LAUGHTER)
00:42:31,00:42:33,...if you can bend any rock...
00:42:33,00:42:34,Yeah.
00:42:34,00:42:36,Is there a use for this bendy rock?
00:42:36,00:42:38,I'm sorry to be all practical.
00:42:38,00:42:39,Um...
00:42:39,00:42:42,"Bouncy castles? Like, actual castles?"
00:42:42,00:42:44,What? Where you have the bendy?
00:42:44,00:42:46,(LAUGHTER)
00:42:46,00:42:47,Awesome.
00:42:47,00:42:51,"I'm not sure we have enough of it, or if it's been studied enough"
00:42:51,00:42:55,to know if it's useful for practical things like building or so on.
00:42:55,00:42:58,So the example that I've got on the screen here for the audience tonight
00:42:58,00:43:01,is from Leeds University. That's in their archives.
00:43:01,00:43:04,"So they obviously send it to universities around the world,"
00:43:04,00:43:05,"going, ""Look, a fucking bendy rock!"""
00:43:05,00:43:08,(LAUGHTER)
00:43:08,00:43:10,So it's obviously a new... That's very cool.
00:43:10,00:43:12,Yeah. Do you want to hear about another magic rock?
00:43:12,00:43:15,"Yes, please. There are magic rocks around the world"
00:43:15,00:43:19,"which are the opposite of seismometers, OK?"
00:43:19,00:43:21,So they tell you when there's not an earthquake.
00:43:21,00:43:23,Bingo. Bingo.
00:43:23,00:43:26,I have a feeling I can do that anyway.
00:43:26,00:43:28,You probably could. You probably could.
00:43:28,00:43:31,Is it when they're not moving?
00:43:31,00:43:32,That means there's no earthquake.
00:43:32,00:43:37,"Yes, yes, but they're even more magical than that."
00:43:37,00:43:41,"Imagine, they're called PBRs. They're precariously balanced rocks."
00:43:41,00:43:43,"Oh, yes."
00:43:43,00:43:46,"They're rocks that look like they should fall over any minute now,"
00:43:46,00:43:49,"but they're still standing. And if you know, you know,"
00:43:49,00:43:51,"how long they've been there, they're reverse seismometers."
00:43:51,00:43:54,They tell you they haven't fallen over. There hasn't been an earthquake
00:43:54,00:43:56,in that set period of time that they've been balanced.
00:43:56,00:44:00,"So this is really useful, because if you want to build a nuclear plant,"
00:44:00,00:44:03,you want to build it somewhere where there hasn't been an earthquake
00:44:03,00:44:06,"for a very, very long time, or a bridge or whatever."
00:44:06,00:44:09,So you build it right underneath a precariously balanced rock.
00:44:09,00:44:12,Exactly. Yeah.
00:44:12,00:44:13,And so these are really useful.
00:44:13,00:44:16,"That's amazing, but aren't that many of them?"
00:44:16,00:44:18,"No, there aren't that many. It's not that useful, actually."
00:44:18,00:44:21,"No, I say it."
00:44:21,00:44:25,"I can think of one, this isn't a rock so much as a virus,"
00:44:25,00:44:27,but there is a thing called a Medusa virus.
00:44:27,00:44:33,"I think it might be useful in Bath, because it can turn amoebas into rocks."
00:44:33,00:44:34,"Oh, really?"
00:44:34,00:44:35,"Isn't that clever, yeah?"
00:44:35,00:44:38,"So when the virus goes into the amoeba,"
00:44:38,00:44:42,it kind of makes this kind of rocky shell over itself
00:44:42,00:44:44,and turns itself into a rock.
00:44:44,00:44:45,That's incredible. Isn't that cool?
00:44:45,00:44:47,But there's the amoeba still inside.
00:44:47,00:44:49,"The amoeba's still living inside, yeah."
00:44:49,00:44:52,"Oh, yeah. What a horrible way to go."
00:44:52,00:44:53,"Yeah, that's great, though."
00:44:53,00:44:58,"So Bath's Mark could become a rock pool, which would be awesome."
00:44:58,00:45:00,"Is that a thing here? It's in Australia, yeah."
00:45:00,00:45:04,"Yeah, we have rock pools in this country, yeah."
00:45:04,00:45:07,"Yeah, but we've also got watercress."
00:45:07,00:45:09,It doesn't mean we've all thought about these things.
00:45:09,00:45:15,I've got a magic rock to accompany yours.
00:45:15,00:45:18,"You can get rock, that is..."
00:45:18,00:45:20,"I think we actually mentioned this once on No Such Thing As A News,"
00:45:20,00:45:23,the long-lost TV show we once did.
00:45:23,00:45:27,"But you can get rock that is as soft as butter,"
00:45:27,00:45:31,that you put your finger in it and it bends like clay.
00:45:31,00:45:33,And this happened.
00:45:33,00:45:34,"It's quite rare, but it happens for instance,"
00:45:34,00:45:36,cavers are told to look out for it.
00:45:36,00:45:38,"It happens when people are making big quarries,"
00:45:38,00:45:39,they come across it.
00:45:39,00:45:41,"And it essentially happens when rock's being dissolved,"
00:45:41,00:45:46,so limestone can be dissolved by very salty waters around it
00:45:46,00:45:47,or acidic waters around it.
00:45:47,00:45:50,"But sometimes a bit of rock will be dissolved,"
00:45:50,00:45:53,"but then it will be surrounded by other rocks,"
00:45:53,00:45:55,so the rock doesn't dissolve and then flow away.
00:45:55,00:46:00,"It just gets trapped, this soft, dissolved bit of rock inside another rock."
00:46:00,00:46:02,"And so apparently when you're caving sometimes or when you're quarrying,"
00:46:02,00:46:04,"you'll tap through a bit of rock,"
00:46:04,00:46:06,and then suddenly you'll think it's rock solid
00:46:06,00:46:09,"and you'll put your finger in, just penetrates all the way through like magic."
00:46:09,00:46:12,- Why is that dangerous? - Sorry?
00:46:12,00:46:15,- Why is it dangerous? - Why is it?
00:46:15,00:46:18,- It's not? - Oh.
00:46:18,00:46:21,I thought you said that people were told to look out for it and stuff.
00:46:21,00:46:23,"- Oh, no, it wasn't like... - Look out for it, like, you know,"
00:46:23,00:46:25,"look out for that adorable squirrel, you know."
00:46:25,00:46:28,"- Ah, right. - It's not, look out!"
00:46:28,00:46:31,"- Right, sorry. - Look out."
00:46:31,00:46:33,- Look out! - Wow.
00:46:33,00:46:36,Do you want to hear some rock-related words and maybe guess what they are?
00:46:36,00:46:39,"- Yes. - So these are kind of mining-related, I would say."
00:46:39,00:46:45,"So, can you guess what a bottom steward is?"
00:46:45,00:46:47,- Bottom steward. - Bottom steward.
00:46:47,00:46:52,"Is Dustin Hoffman played this role, actually?"
00:46:52,00:46:54,- Someone who looks after the lifts in the mine. - Pretty close.
00:46:54,00:46:58,It's someone who looks after the people who work at the bottom of the pit.
00:46:58,00:47:00,"- Oh, okay. Nice. - Back ripper."
00:47:00,00:47:05,"- Back ripper. - No, it's someone who removes the old supports."
00:47:05,00:47:08,"So when you're going away from somewhere, you get all the supports from behind you"
00:47:08,00:47:11,"and then you put them in front of you, so you're ripping them away from the back."
00:47:11,00:47:12,"- Oh, okay. - That's so clever."
00:47:12,00:47:15,- Do you know what a glory hole is? - Yes.
00:47:15,00:47:21,"Well, I think I thought I did."
00:47:21,00:47:26,"Perhaps they've got time for that sort of business down the bottom of a mine, though."
00:47:26,00:47:28,Everyone's got to let us steam at the end of the day.
00:47:28,00:47:30,"- No, I've no idea. - If you have that rock"
00:47:30,00:47:33,"that you could just put your finger in, then maybe no, no."
00:47:33,00:47:36,Is it a way of seeing from different mining tunnels to each other?
00:47:36,00:47:41,"No, it's just what miners call an extremely impressive excavation on the surface."
00:47:41,00:47:44,They call that a glory hole.
00:47:44,00:47:47,Can I just quickly tell you something about glory holes?
00:47:47,00:47:49,"Oh, yeah, go on."
00:47:49,00:47:51,"Finally, we're on that subject, are we?"
00:47:51,00:47:54,"I remember, so when COVID first kicked off,"
00:47:54,00:47:59,the EU had a bunch of recommendations for how to avoid getting it.
00:47:59,00:48:03,"And there was, and I was on the EU legal side of the website,"
00:48:03,00:48:07,a recommendation that you take advantage of glory holes
00:48:07,00:48:10,to stop yourself from contracting the disease.
00:48:10,00:48:11,Um...
00:48:11,00:48:14,"Wait, that's how you have sex through, right?"
00:48:14,00:48:16,"- Yes, yes, yes, yes. - Yeah."
00:48:16,00:48:19,"Yeah, yeah. And it's in the EU law."
00:48:19,00:48:23,It feels like there might be other diseases that you're leaving yourself open for.
00:48:23,00:48:28,"I just saw people walking around with a dart, didn't you, with a hole in them."
00:48:28,00:48:31,I know that the oldest glory... We're just on glory hole facts now.
00:48:31,00:48:36,"But the oldest glory hole in Australia is in a museum, I think, in Perth."
00:48:36,00:48:41,"And there was a big argument about whether this should be allowed to be in a museum,"
00:48:41,00:48:42,"because, you know, it's a glory hole."
00:48:42,00:48:47,"But they were saying, well, it's a really important part of the LGBTQ community"
00:48:47,00:48:49,in Perth and in Western Australia.
00:48:49,00:48:52,"I mean, how old is it? Is it like Caveman?"
00:48:52,00:48:54,And is it an interactive exhibit?
00:48:54,00:48:58,LAUGHTER
00:48:58,00:49:00,"Have you seen, Dan, have you seen those things at the seaside"
00:49:00,00:49:04,where you put your head through and you get a photograph?
00:49:04,00:49:06,It's like that.
00:49:06,00:49:10,"I know it's my fault we're on this, but let's go back to your raw vocabulary."
00:49:10,00:49:12,"No, no, I was going to say..."
00:49:12,00:49:14,"Oh, do you know the word bougie?"
00:49:14,00:49:18,"- Oh. - It was a particular, fast-drying type of cement"
00:49:18,00:49:21,that you would pump into the bottom of a mine to give you a flaw.
00:49:21,00:49:22,- Cool. Really? - That was known as bougie.
00:49:22,00:49:24,- Yeah. Isn't that cool? - Mining is so cool.
00:49:24,00:49:28,Mining is... Some mines are so deep that the lifts can't go all the way down
00:49:28,00:49:33,because the lift cable is so heavy that you have to stop
00:49:33,00:49:35,because the lift would snap under the weight of the cable.
00:49:35,00:49:37,So you have to go down to a certain level and get into a new lift
00:49:37,00:49:39,and go all the way down to the bottom.
00:49:39,00:49:41,- Wow. - The technology that they have is just crazy.
00:49:41,00:49:46,"So that's taller, like, it goes deeper than the Burj Al Khalif, for example."
00:49:46,00:49:49,"- Well, no, I think they have to have more than one lift as well."
00:49:49,00:49:52,"- Oh, there's more than one lift there, right? - Yeah, same issue as skyscrapers."
00:49:52,00:49:59,"- Oh, wow. Tracey Eman, the artist, married a rock a few years ago."
00:49:59,00:50:03,"- The rock are... - No, just a rock, sadly. Sadly for her."
00:50:03,00:50:06,"She found a rock in her garden and she said, ""I'm marrying this rock."""
00:50:06,00:50:11,She was 52. She wore her father's funeral shroud for the marriage.
00:50:11,00:50:14,"And she said, ""It's not going anywhere. It will be there waiting for me."""
00:50:14,00:50:17,"And she said, ""The stone I married is beautiful and dignified."
00:50:17,00:50:19,"""It will never let me down."""
00:50:19,00:50:21,They divorced two years later.
00:50:22,00:50:24,- Do you know what's mad about that?
00:50:24,00:50:28,It's that I'm pretty sure I was reading an interview with Tracey Eman recently
00:50:28,00:50:30,"and her mum wanted to call her ""pebble."""
00:50:30,00:50:33,"I'm fairly certain that's right. And her mum really wanted to call her ""pebble."""
00:50:33,00:50:37,"And I think the doctors at the hospital said, ""We can't let you call your daughter ""pebble."""
00:50:37,00:50:41,- Because you'll be fucked up if you do. - What?
00:50:41,00:50:44,"- Why would they say that? The doctors? - They said, ""It's not a good name."""
00:50:44,00:50:49,"- They said, ""It's not a proper name."" - Well, tell that to Fred Flintstone."
00:50:49,00:50:52,"Okay, that is it. That is all of our facts."
