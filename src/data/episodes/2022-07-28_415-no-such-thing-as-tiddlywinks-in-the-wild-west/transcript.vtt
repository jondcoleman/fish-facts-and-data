00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:18.320
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.000
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.720
 this week coming to you live from Baaaaaah!

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.720
 (audience cheering)

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.680
 - My name is Dan Shriver, I am sitting here

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.640
 with Anna Tyshensky, Andrew Huntsomuri, and James Harkin.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.800
 And once again, we have gathered 'round the microphones

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.000
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.480
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.960
 Starting with fact number one, that is Anna.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.640
 - My fact this week is that the reason you can no longer

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.800
 bathe in the Roman bars at bars is because

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.000
 they contain brain eating amoeba.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.080
 (audience laughing)

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.920
 - Wow.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.760
 - So that, like, I was, I don't know,

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.040
 doing like a D-rate horror film or something,

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.120
 but yeah, it's true, there are amoeba in the bars

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.720
 that will eat your brain.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.640
 - I must say, Anna, since you told us this fact,

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.760
 and we got to our travel lodge, your premier in,

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.480
 or whatever it was today, I was thinking,

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.880
 can I drink the water in bath?

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:19.720
 - I know!

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.560
 - Oh, yeah!

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.560
 - How do we need to address it?

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.560
 - I have a question about this,

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.920
 which is, Anna, I'd like to know,

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:24.760
 how do we need to address it?

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.600
 - I have a question about this,

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.720
 which is that I have drunk the waters of Bath,

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.600
 and I don't know exactly which ones I drunk.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.960
 I imagine that--

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.400
 - Just some random bath water.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.720
 (audience laughing)

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.600
 Actually, that's the problem with this fact,

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.120
 when you try and research it,

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.800
 if you Google bath water--

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.640
 - Yes.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.880
 - All you get is someone called Belle Delphine,

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.520
 (audience laughing)

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.680
 who is apparently an adult influencer

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.880
 who was selling her bath water for $30 a bottle.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.840
 - Oh, wow.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.720
 - Okay, well, you shouldn't be bathing

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.120
 in Belle Delphine's bath water, or Bath's bath water,

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.360
 and it's not all the water in bath,

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.760
 it's just directly from the spring,

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.560
 so this was discovered in the '70s.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.200
 I hadn't realized that until 1978,

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.880
 you could bathe directly in the spring,

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.280
 you know, when you're in the bath, baths in the museum,

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.120
 there's that bath.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.840
 How many times do I say the word bath?

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.680
 (audience laughing)

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.280
 And I hadn't realized that people used to swim in it

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.120
 until 1978, and then they realized

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.360
 that coming direct from the spring

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.600
 was this amoeba called Nigleria fowleri,

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.520
 which is also known as the brain-eating amoeba,

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.680
 and you get it in warm, fresh water, it's very rare,

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.520
 and like I said, it's just this one spring,

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.840
 it's not in any of the rest of the water,

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.240
 and it burrows into your brain through your nose,

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.080
 so it goes up your nose

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.880
 and then burrows straight into your brain,

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.280
 and it's 100% fatal.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.480
 - So that's okay, that means it's fine

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.400
 if you drink water, you're not gonna get it.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.040
 It doesn't, if you drank the water,

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.760
 if you jumped into, and don't do this,

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.160
 but if you did jump into the bath spars

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.640
 and you just took down a lot down your mouth,

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.320
 but kept your nose out of the water, you'd be fine.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.400
 - But then if someone made you laugh halfway through

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.280
 and it accidentally went up into your nose,

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.360
 - Oh yes.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.200
 - It would murder you.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.040
 - It came out the other way.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.400
 - What is great murder mystery, though?

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.240
 - Yeah.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.240
 What did I pay 50p to drink in about 2006?

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.520
 - That was just Evian, they siphoned it into a-

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.040
 - No, it wasn't, it tasted horrible,

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.680
 it tasted sulfurous, and it was strong stuff.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.800
 - So sorry, what's the story, Andy?

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.640
 What's his story?

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.320
 - I went to the bath pump rooms in 2006

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.520
 and paid 50p to drink a glass of Frank,

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.320
 I'm sorry guys, horrible water.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.480
 (audience laughing)

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.800
 Very clever, seeing it's magic, it was nasty.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.680
 - I think this is the bit that doesn't have the amoeba in it.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.400
 - So it's boreholed now.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.000
 So basically you still get the really curative,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.640
 brilliant waters of bath that feed the Roman barns

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.960
 and they feed, you guys have probably been to that hotel

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.000
 with the swimming pool on the top

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.520
 that's fed direct from the spring, which is very lovely.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.240
 And that's just all through borehols,

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.040
 so it's not coming straight from the spring.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.520
 So this amoeba is filtered out.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.960
 - Why did you drink it?

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.640
 Why was the thing to do, was it?

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.360
 - It's advertised. - Yeah, you go to the bath,

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.120
 you know, the beautiful, beautiful tea room

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.760
 at the bath spa, and they say this is the water

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.720
 that people have been drinking for hundreds of years

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.520
 for its curative properties.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.800
 - This is the water that hasn't cured anyone

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.120
 for the last 2,500 years, unless it's not cured.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.200
 - What, so cure you?

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.040
 - It did, it cured a man called Bladdard,

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.320
 who was the whole reason for the baths being founded.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.840
 And Bladdard, he had an infection basically,

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.080
 he had a Bladdard infection, and he was--

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.480
 - He had leprosy.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.720
 - He had leprosy, yeah, he had leprosy.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.720
 He was exiled by his family.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.480
 He went to Athens, got leprosy,

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.920
 and then came back to England,

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.840
 was exiled by his family for having leprosy,

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:36.960
 and became a swine herd.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.480
 But then his pigs jumped into the waters of the bath,

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.440
 which were coming up through the borehol,

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.040
 and they fronked, and they got better,

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.120
 and their leprosy was cured.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.800
 So he built the city of Bath.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.760
 So that's what happened.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.800
 - And that is a true story.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.120
 - Right.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.840
 - He's like a semi-mythical,

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.760
 probably actually mythical king, isn't he?

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.640
 But he was like the father of King Lear, Bladdard.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.840
 They first wrote about him,

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:02.800
 the first person to write about him

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.240
 was Geoffrey of Monmouth in the 12th century.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.480
 And he wrote that Bladdard died

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.040
 when he constructed some wings for himself,

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.920
 and flew into a wall.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.200
 (laughter)

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.040
 - Nice one, mate.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.880
 - It's so good.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:17.720
 - What a waste.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.480
 - 'Cause it sounds like the wings worked,

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.000
 but it was a directional issue that...

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.480
 (laughter)

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.920
 - It was his sat-down, yeah.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.600
 He was like, he was a necromancer, supposedly,

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.240
 and so he kind of, he got the, you know,

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.760
 the devil to make him wings, and stuff like that.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:33.600
 - Wow.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.440
 - That was cool, eh?

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.280
 - That was really cool.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.200
 - So, just very quickly,

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.400
 because I think a lot of, you know, we're in Bath,

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.480
 and so everyone here knows what we're talking about,

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.120
 but we do have a lot of overseas listeners,

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.080
 and I know it is famous, but these were Roman baths.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.520
 These were built by the Romans,

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.840
 and they used to go in every single day.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:49.680
 They used to swim.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.400
 There was an, in the city as well.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.520
 There's been festivals.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.320
 It's a big deal that, after the back of the '70s,

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.160
 no one can swim because of this amoeba,

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.360
 because that was, the city is literally named for it.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.640
 It's called Bath for it.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.560
 And, apparently, the reason that this amoeba came around

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.440
 is because there used to be a roof over it,

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.280
 and the roof has gone now.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.600
 And so the sunlight has caused for this amoeba to find itself.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:17.120
 This is what I read on a tweet, and, wow.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.520
 But it was from a tweet from someone

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.560
 who felt like they knew what they were talking about.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.360
 You know, there was a solid hashtag next to it,

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.120
 and it was a historian,

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.560
 but supposedly there was a big roof that was over it,

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.400
 and because that's not--

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.720
 - So what do the roof, the roof--

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.560
 - Stop the sunlight,

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.840
 and the sunlight is what was attracting the amoeba.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:32.680
 - Wow, 'cause they-- - I see.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:33.680
 - Well, they say that the sunlight

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.080
 is the best disinfectant, don't they?

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.360
 But except in this case,

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.640
 when it causes a fatal brain-eating amoeba.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.760
 It's always the second half. - That's the second half, yeah, yeah.

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.360
 - He's in the small print of sunlight.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.640
 - There was a guy who, in 1999,

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:49.240
 a naked man jumped into the baths in Bath claiming--

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.960
 he was claiming to be Julius Caesar.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.760
 He jumped into the baths, and he refused to get out,

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.960
 and there was a big standoff, because--

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.400
 - Well, he's the emperor, you can't just drag him out.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.480
 Can you? - Exactly.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.600
 And they didn't want to go in,

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.040
 maybe because of the amoeba thing,

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.960
 but they had to unplug it and then wait for it.

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.080
 It takes three hours to drain.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.760
 - Really? - Well, they drained the whole thing.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.320
 - They drained the whole thing, and then--

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.800
 - Mate, just drag him out into the steps and murder him.

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.000
 (audience laughing)

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.640
 Do it the Roman way. - That's too suspicious.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.200
 - I mean, it sounds so fun.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.680
 I don't know if there's anyone listening.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.840
 Maybe there is who remembers this,

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.640
 but they used to hold things called the Roman rendezvous,

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:28.120
 and they were held for four nights during the bath festival,

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.360
 and this was in the '60s.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.200
 You'd pay five shillings, and it was a huge party,

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.880
 and you'd all just jump around and swim in the baths,

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.800
 and then you'd go and dance the night away in the pump room.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.640
 It sounds so fun.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.400
 Like, 1,400 people will go to this big old bath party.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.760
 - Sounds amazing. - Yeah.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.080
 - Someone remembers it.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.080
 - That's a screen that's 40 years too young to remember that.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.280
 (audience laughing)

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.680
 - Oh, the baths are so rejuvenating.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.600
 (audience laughing)

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:54.520
 - Well, that's the thing, Anna.

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.320
 You said that no one was cured from it,

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.000
 but I've checked some local newspaper archives,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.280
 and apparently there was a guy called William Toop of Froome,

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.920
 who suffered from paralysis

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:07.640
 after getting into cold water to gather watercress,

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.320
 and he was cured,

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.480
 and there was someone else who was bottling wine

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.160
 in a cold damp cellar for several hours,

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.360
 and they were cured of their palsy,

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.040
 and there was someone who got colic

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:21.000
 after drinking stale beer in hot weather,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.240
 and he got cured as well,

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.560
 so, you know, that's evidence for you.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.400
 - Yeah.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.800
 - I'm not even sure you can get ill

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.400
 from bottling wine in a cellar for seven hours,

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.640
 let alone then get cured by a bath,

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.680
 but maybe, it definitely does actually

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.040
 have some curative properties,

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:37.520
 like things like arthritis.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.640
 - Sorry, is that how you get watercress?

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.680
 You have to go into some water to get it.

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.080
 - That's the name.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:43.920
 - Ah.

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:47.480
 (audience laughing)

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.720
 - I'm very interested in that.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:49.560
 I'm sorry.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:50.380
 - Did you think it just grew naturally

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:53.040
 on the painted clay heads of those little things

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:53.880
 you make in year seven?

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:54.920
 - Yeah, I thought it was just like Cress.

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.080
 It's just Cress doesn't grow in water, does it?

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:57.920
 I don't know.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:58.760
 - Well, why do you think they cold it?

00:08:58.760 --> 00:08:59.600
 All those years ago,

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.840
 why do you think they cold it watercress?

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.920
 I've never given it even a second thought

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.680
 in my life why I still watercress.

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.080
 - Well, I'm a busy guy.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.240
 - Where do you think seaweed's from?

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.600
 But just out of curiosity.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.600
 (audience laughing)

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:16.480
 - Okay.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.680
 - The baths used to be prescribed on the NHS

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:19.800
 until pretty recently.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.640
 - Really?

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.400
 - Yeah, yeah, they actually had a deal.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.960
 Bath did this bath.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.760
 Buxton, which for overseas listeners

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.320
 is another big spa town in the UK,

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.760
 had deals with the NHS.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.160
 They had contracts where people

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.880
 would get prescribed water treatments

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.640
 and you'd go in and be sent there for back

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.680
 and joint pain and stuff like that.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:37.640
 And actually in World War II,

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.680
 there were really cool pictures if you look it up.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.080
 Oh, no, sorry, I think it's after World War I,

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.760
 they decided that sitting soldiers,

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.600
 wounded soldiers in baths for long periods of time

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.640
 would help them recover more quickly.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.480
 And you can see hospital rooms

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.800
 where instead of lying in beds,

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.680
 there were just lines of men who were submerged in baths,

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.600
 which they had to stay in for up to 42 hours.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.360
 - Oh, wow.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.400
 - Imagine how wrinkly you go.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:01.240
 - Yeah, it's bruised.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.880
 - Yeah.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.720
 - So the, I'm sorry,

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.760
 bath dimension of rivals, spa town,

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:09.000
 but Harrogate has a spa as well.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.200
 - Ooh.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.840
 - I don't know guys, it sounds pretty good.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:14.760
 So some of the treatments that you'd have,

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.200
 these are from the '20s in Harrogate spa.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.040
 The sulphur electric bath, sounds pretty good.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:24.240
 There was the beat.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.320
 - The old combining electricity with a bath.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.160
 - That's right.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.000
 - I don't feel quite right.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.920
 - It's like another toaster, it will, you know?

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:33.120
 - There was the peat bath,

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:36.720
 which used fresh peat from the Yorkshire Moors in P-E-A-T,

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.120
 you know, the peat that you put on the garden.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:38.960
 - Yeah.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:39.800
 - There was also--

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.640
 - I didn't think you meant peat.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.480
 - Someone called Peter gets thrown.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.120
 - Hey guys, I'm here.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.160
 - Fresh peat.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.280
 - Room for another?

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.600
 - What about a bit of fruit?

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.680
 - But there was also electric peat,

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.640
 where they put you in a bath full of peat

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:56.200
 and just ran a current through the peat.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.080
 - Every patient got a fresh peat, okay?

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.160
 'Cause you don't want to have someone else's peat.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.480
 That would be disgusting.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.480
 Imagine some peat that someone else has been in.

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.320
 Ugh.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.680
 So they use 25 tons of peat a week.

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:08.760
 25 tons.

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:09.600
 - That's a lot of peat.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.840
 - That's so much.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:15.080
 Do you think all the people who are called peat together

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:17.360
 weigh more than the amount they used in a week?

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.720
 - If it's 20 tons, yeah.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.560
 - Yeah.

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.360
 - By quite a considerable amount.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:25.640
 - Probably, yeah.

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:26.480
 Probably the mass doesn't stack up.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.440
 - I've been to a rival spa as well.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.840
 I've been to one in Budapest.

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.600
 Budapest has the most thermal spas

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.520
 in the whole of mainland Europe.

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:37.920
 Some more in Reykjavik,

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.680
 but in mainland Europe they have it.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:40.840
 Unfortunately, when I went there,

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:43.560
 I'd left my swimming costume in the hotel.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.640
 And so I thought, well, I'll just buy one when I get there.

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.280
 But they only rent them.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.840
 (laughing)

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:53.880
 So I had to rent a swimming costume in Budapest.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.600
 The good news is that the baths

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.400
 are very good for skin diseases.

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.660
 (laughing)

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:03.040
 - So it just balances out, doesn't it, at the end?

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.240
 - But can you request size?

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.040
 Or is it like a school's lost property box

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.360
 when you forget your swimmers?

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.360
 - I think they just looked at me and went,

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.200
 peat!

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.520
 (laughing)

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:12.560
 Very extra large.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:17.440
 - Have you guys heard of the bath curse tablets?

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.520
 - Oh, no.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:19.560
 - Oh, this is very cool.

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:23.880
 This is a collection of 130 Roman-era curse tablets.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.280
 And they were discovered in 1979, 1980.

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.200
 And the idea was if someone stole something from you

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.640
 in bath, you could go to these tablets,

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.120
 which were connected to a goddess.

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.400
 And you could say,

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.520
 I want you to take over the investigation, goddess.

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:39.480
 And you can smite the person.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.600
 And so the idea was if they went to that,

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.280
 the person who stole the thing might return it,

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:45.000
 'cause they were freaked out that,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.360
 you know, suddenly a goddess was on the case.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.800
 - It was a very low crime solving rate back then,

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:50.640
 wasn't it?

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.120
 That was their method.

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.760
 - But it's amazing, 'cause there's one thing,

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:54.920
 and they're not too sure yet,

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:58.600
 but it's written in sort of Latin

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.480
 as how they wrote on these tablets.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:04.200
 But they're also written supposedly in British Celtic.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.800
 And if it's the case that it is,

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:06.640
 and they still don't know,

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:07.960
 if it is the case that it is,

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.760
 it's the only example of British Celtic

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.760
 that we have that has survived on tablet form.

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:15.120
 Yeah, so historians are trying to work out

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.280
 whether or not that is the case.

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:17.400
 'Cause I know some of them are,

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:19.480
 and this is a really amazing discovery,

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:23.320
 which goes to show that Bath is the bitchiest place

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.680
 known to man.

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:27.160
 Because the only things that were found here

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.240
 when everyone excavated the Roman Baths

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:30.960
 was all these tablets saying,

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.560
 "I don't like them, so they stole my hair clip.

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:35.040
 "I want you to kill them."

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:35.880
 (audience laughing)

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.560
 It was all such disproportionate stuff,

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:41.880
 like Dosey Meadis has lost two gloves.

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:43.960
 So this is Dosey Meadis referring to himself

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:46.160
 in the third person, so already a bit of a dick.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.200
 (audience laughing)

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.600
 Dosey Meadis has lost two gloves

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.520
 and asks that the thief responsible

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:56.520
 should lose their mind and eyes in the goddess's temple.

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.600
 (audience laughing)

00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.440
 Come on.

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:00.440
 - That's disproportionate.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:01.280
 - It is.

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:03.520
 - Dosey Meadis.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:06.560
 It's probably thought, no, after he died,

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.120
 everyone's going, "No one will ever mention that guy again."

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:10.840
 (audience laughing)

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.040
 Well, I think we've got to move on, guys,

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:13.000
 to our next fact.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.240
 - Oh, I've got one little eventual

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:16.160
 that someone had in a bath recently.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:17.240
 - Great. - Yeah.

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:18.760
 - Save your personal stories, Andy.

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:22.800
 - This happened in 2017 in Texas.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:23.640
 This is amazing.

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:26.320
 This happened to a woman called Charlesetta Williams.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.960
 She was in the bath, she's 75 years old,

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.440
 and a tornado hit her house,

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:33.200
 and it ripped the roof off the house,

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:36.200
 and then it ripped the bath out of its moorings.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.280
 - And she was in there.

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:38.120
 - She was in there.

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:38.960
 - Wow.

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.120
 - She was actually, she was in the bath

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:42.400
 with her 40-year-old son at the time,

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.440
 and it was-- - Sorry, how old?

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.760
 - How old?

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.560
 - 40. - 40?

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:47.880
 - Well, they were-- - 40-year-olds.

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.360
 - They were sheltering from the tornado.

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:50.200
 They weren't.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:53.200
 (audience laughing)

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:57.560
 Who was it?

00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:01.880
 I presume.

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:04.240
 (audience laughing)

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.200
 - Unless, as someone's called Pete,

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.720
 in which case, completely normal.

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.800
 (audience laughing)

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:14.360
 When they land, the tornado ripped her clothes off,

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:15.200
 it must have.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.200
 (audience laughing)

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:17.600
 - Come on. - How did that happen?

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:18.920
 - Come on.

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:20.440
 This is very upsetting.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:26.280
 They were fine.

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:29.600
 He was, he was tossed out of the bath by me.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.440
 (audience laughing)

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:32.600
 Come on, come on, come on.

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:36.160
 (audience laughing)

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:38.400
 - The wind speed was about 130 miles an hour

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:39.240
 of the tornado.

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.520
 They didn't end up that far away from the house.

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:41.960
 It wasn't like they ended up miles away.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.320
 They were in the garden at the end of it.

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:44.280
 - And were they, okay.

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:46.000
 I mean, does it have a happy ending?

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 (audience laughing)

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:59.640
 - It is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:01.720
 - My fact is that there is a Spanish firm

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:04.080
 which has six official ham sniffers.

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:07.400
 Their job is to poke pork loins,

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:08.840
 sniff them and make sure they're good.

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:12.960
 And at most they smell 800 hams a day.

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.000
 - Well, I have a question.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.400
 Don't they all just smell of ham?

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:18.560
 - Well, that's to you and me.

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:19.600
 They absolutely would.

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.760
 But to these amazing experts.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:23.320
 So this, you may have seen this.

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:25.640
 It, you know, did the rounds a bit online before Christmas,

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:27.000
 but it's such an incredible fact.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.160
 Is this Spanish firm called Cinto Jotas.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:33.400
 And it's a company that they sell hams.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:34.720
 And they're 150 years old.

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:36.120
 They're a very ancient lineage firm.

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:38.560
 They produce very traditional Iberian ham

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.200
 from, you know, pigs which have been fed

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.920
 on special acorns, this kind of thing.

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:44.320
 And they have trained workers

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:47.040
 whose specific job exclusively,

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.400
 it's not like I do this for a couple of hours a day,

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.320
 their job is to smell the hams

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.720
 to make sure they're good before they go on sale.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.480
 And they have little kind of pipettes

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.520
 or little kind of jabbers to jab the ham

00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:59.000
 in four specific places.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.920
 - And then they have to smudge it over, right?

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:03.440
 It is the most amazing jobs.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.880
 And some people will be qualified

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.800
 to sniff some types of ham, but not other types of ham.

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:08.640
 - Yes. - What?

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:10.480
 - There's more than one type of ham.

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.680
 - There is a guy who is really good,

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:16.000
 but he is not qualified to sniff a particular bit of ham.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.160
 - Wow. - His father is.

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.760
 He hasn't yet qualified

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.560
 to sniffing that particular bit of the ham.

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:25.040
 So they have five seasonal workers at Christmas time,

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:28.960
 but there is one guy who sniffs year in, year out.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.920
 And you have to do each ham in four places.

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:33.880
 So he sniffs 3,200 times a day.

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:35.760
 - Yeah, but that's in the high season.

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:39.560
 Like on a usual day, he'll do 200 and going to 800,

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:43.480
 so 800 loins a day, he'll do 3,200 sniffs.

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.280
 And he says even that is pushing him to the edge,

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:47.360
 to the limit.

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.520
 That's one sniff every nine seconds.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.120
 - Yeah, it's insane.

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:52.560
 - Assuming the standard data working day.

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:54.800
 - Yeah, but if he's only doing nine seconds per sniff,

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:57.640
 that says to me he's not really doing a very thorough job.

00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:01.240
 - Well, he accusation leveled.

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:02.480
 - Yeah, he's very proud.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.160
 - He's called Mr. Vega, and he says the job that he is doing

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:08.320
 pushes him at the limit of human possibility.

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.640
 It's just, it's amazing.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:11.480
 It was in the Wall Street Journal.

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:12.440
 It's just such a good piece.

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:13.440
 It's so interesting.

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:15.880
 - And they do say that if you can't tell straight away,

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:17.600
 then you're not doing it right.

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:20.040
 So they say it's really gotta be an immediate instinctive thing.

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:20.880
 - Oh, okay.

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:22.600
 - So, you know, really you should be doing more.

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:25.920
 - Yeah, they do tests where they take a smell

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:27.960
 and they put it into, so let's say they'll take

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:30.960
 five milliliters per liter of a smell

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.040
 and pop it into some water,

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.200
 and then they'll put it into plastic cups,

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.400
 and you'll have to then sniff the cup.

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:38.320
 And because a plastic cup,

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:40.120
 the odor of the cup itself will take over,

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:42.640
 there's a sort of time limit of about an hour or so

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.280
 where that starts taking over.

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:45.120
 So the younger--

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.720
 - I think it's, I thought it was a couple of minutes

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:47.960
 of the smell of plastic.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:48.800
 - Oh, wow, really, okay.

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:50.640
 - Surely it doesn't take us an hour to smell plastic.

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:51.480
 - No, 'cause some of the smellers,

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.080
 according to the Wall Street Journal article,

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:54.640
 they take ages sniffing it,

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:57.400
 but Mr. Vega, this guy who pushes himself

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.240
 to the limit of human possibility,

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:03.280
 he says, "If you doubt yourself, you cannot do the work."

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:04.680
 And then, according to the article,

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:06.120
 taps himself on the chest,

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.480
 and he says, "If you doubt one,

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.360
 you have to doubt all of them."

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:11.800
 So he's like, "You've got to make your decision now."

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:13.920
 He's an amazing guy, yeah.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:15.800
 - So was this also in the article

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.840
 about Christina Sanchez Blanco,

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:22.200
 who's the first woman to be head ham sniffer at Cinco Yotas?

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.040
 - Oh.

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:25.760
 - Because I read that she has such a good sense of smell

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:28.040
 that whenever her husband buys her a gift,

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:30.560
 she knows what it is before she unwraps it.

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:31.800
 (audience laughing)

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:32.640
 - Wow.

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:35.240
 - He keeps buying her cowl pads though, doesn't he?

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:37.520
 - Apparently, if he buys her perfume,

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:39.200
 he has to quadruple wrap it

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:40.640
 so that she won't be able to smell it.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:41.680
 - That's so funny, good.

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:44.200
 I thought, yeah, I didn't realise at first

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.560
 that you were talking about things like perfume.

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.400
 I said, I thought she'd be able to say...

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.640
 - This is an Xbox.

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.840
 (audience laughing)

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:53.600
 - It's a book by George Elliot, I think.

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.640
 Hang on, it's one of the earlier ones.

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:57.400
 (audience laughing)

00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:00.320
 But this, like, the accuracy of the nose

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.200
 depends on their exterior life as well.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:05.640
 So Mr. Vega, talking of perfume,

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:07.360
 he says he wishes and hopes

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:08.960
 that his wife never changes perfume,

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:11.320
 because if she does, that alters his no-sense.

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:13.200
 Like, he went through a bit of a chaotic time

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:16.200
 when he swapped to a new anti-bolding shampoo,

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:18.320
 and that absolutely messed with his nostrils,

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:20.080
 'cause he was like, it was so potent,

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:22.200
 it threw him off and he couldn't do his job well.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.920
 - Quite difficult people to be married to, really.

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.920
 So this poor woman either, you know,

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:28.400
 A, can't change her perfume,

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.880
 and B, her husband's now bald.

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:35.880
 And then Sanchez Blanco, Miss Sanchez Blanco,

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.760
 who you mentioned, James,

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.320
 she said that her husband's a policeman,

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:40.840
 and then at the moment he comes home,

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:43.320
 she tells him every day about the day he's had

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.000
 before he can say a word,

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.480
 'cause she can smell it on him.

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:47.640
 - What?

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:50.200
 - Whether it's like gasoline from a car crash, she says,

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:53.840
 soot from a fire, dander from a rescued pet.

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:56.000
 - God, you wouldn't risk having an affair, would you?

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.320
 - No.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:58.960
 - Well, you might, if you had an affair

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.600
 with like a butcher or something,

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.000
 then that would be okay, wouldn't it?

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.160
 Because all they get is the smell of the meat,

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:07.600
 and just assume it was off their own clothes and stuff.

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.600
 - Also, in this quite small town,

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:10.440
 it sounds like he's having

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:14.000
 a much more action-packed police life than you should.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.320
 Are we sure he's not just dousing himself

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:19.240
 to cover his affair with soot just before he gets home,

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:20.840
 or smothering himself in sausages

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:22.560
 to catch the sausage bang?

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:26.680
 - Do you know that Wafer Thin Ham has up to 25% water?

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.280
 They've recently done a study of this,

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:29.360
 and they found that like,

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:30.960
 when they get this Wafer Thin Stuff,

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.240
 most of it is actually water,

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:33.760
 not most of it, but like a quarter of it

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.120
 can be actually water.

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:37.960
 And so that means that if you have 100 gram pack

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:40.960
 of Wafer Thin Ham, which costs about 90p,

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:43.360
 that means, and it's 28% water, say,

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:46.960
 that means you're paying 25p just for the water,

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.080
 which means you're paying the equivalent of like,

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.760
 a five pounds for a very small bottle of water,

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:53.320
 that's the equivalent.

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:55.640
 It's only eight times less expensive

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:57.560
 than Belle Delphine's Bathwater.

00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:59.800
 (laughing)

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.160
 - Gosh.

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.840
 - You know Linda McCartney, who makes vegetarian--

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:05.680
 - Yeah, yes.

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.320
 - Which she doesn't anymore.

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:08.840
 - But veggie, yeah.

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:09.680
 - Veggie stuff.

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.440
 This is, someone sent this as ages ago,

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:12.800
 and I just remembered it.

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:16.960
 She, the factory that makes her vegetarian fake meat

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:19.040
 is in Fakern Ham.

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:20.080
 - What? - No.

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:21.320
 - Fakern Ham.

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:22.160
 - No.

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:23.360
 - Yeah.

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:25.960
 So I don't know, did she choose it specifically?

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:26.800
 Did she?

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:27.640
 - That's amazing.

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:28.460
 - Where is it?

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:29.300
 Where's Fakern Ham?

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:30.140
 - Do you know, I actually,

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:31.560
 does anyone know where Fakern Ham is?

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:32.400
 - Oh, Fakern Ham.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:33.240
 - Norfolk.

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:34.080
 - Norfolk.

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:34.920
 - Yeah.

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:35.760
 - Great.

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:36.600
 - Right.

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:37.440
 - Yeah.

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.280
 - Wow.

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:39.120
 - That's why we've never heard of it.

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:39.960
 - That's really good.

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:40.800
 (laughing)

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:44.640
 - Pro sniffing things, professional sniffers.

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:46.760
 This is a thing, and there are lots of,

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:48.440
 lots of different kinds of professional sniffer

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:49.400
 all the way across the world.

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:53.320
 So there are people who sniff armpits for a living.

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:54.520
 There's a man called Barry Druitt,

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:57.280
 who genuinely works for a firm called

00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:58.600
 Princeton Consumer Research,

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:01.040
 and he's spent 20 years smelling armpits.

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:03.080
 - You haven't explained why.

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:03.920
 - Great point.

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:07.400
 Cosmetics companies send this firm,

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:08.760
 Princeton Consumer Research,

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:11.160
 all their products which have different active ingredients.

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:14.160
 So he smells armpits of volunteers,

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.000
 rates how smelly they are,

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.800
 and then they use the deodorant or whatever it is,

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:21.240
 and he will rate how well it manages to mask them.

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:23.120
 So a firm might have six different kinds

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:24.680
 of potential new deodorant,

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:27.240
 and he will assess which one is best.

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:28.880
 But he doesn't like smelling armpits, he said.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.440
 He thinks they're disgusting.

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:32.920
 - Well, you know, a job's a job, isn't it?

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:33.760
 (laughing)

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:34.600
 - A job's a job.

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:35.520
 - You should have said it in the interview,

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:36.360
 shouldn't you?

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:37.200
 (laughing)

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.720
 What they said in the interview,

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:40.080
 do you like smelling armpits?

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.720
 He should have gone, no, I don't, actually.

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:43.280
 (laughing)

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:45.840
 - Well, if you liked it, that would actually be bad,

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:47.400
 because you wouldn't want a deodorant

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:48.880
 to mask the smell of an armpit.

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:49.720
 - That's a good point.

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:50.840
 He needs someone who hates the work.

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:51.680
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:55.960
 - But he doesn't have to do it nose-to-pit, as it were.

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:59.320
 He has these smell cones that he sniffs through.

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:00.680
 You get specific smell cones,

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:01.920
 which are for sampling smells.

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:03.880
 - And you put the pad under your armpit, don't you?

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:04.720
 I think people donate. - No, no, no.

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:05.840
 He goes into the pit.

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:06.680
 - He goes into the pit.

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.920
 - But he has got a cone kind of caught on sanitaire

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:10.000
 of little paper cones.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.720
 - I see, 'cause sometimes they do it with an armpit pad.

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:16.000
 I think maybe if they've got a bit of extra budget,

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.760
 and there's a company called Cavern Care,

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:22.240
 which is an Indian cosmetics company.

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:23.440
 And they say they have a real problem

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:24.920
 with women's deodorant,

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:29.080
 as in they have a shortage of volunteers to donate sweat,

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:31.120
 because women, in particular in India,

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:34.160
 women is a bit taboo to donate your sweat to be smelled.

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.920
 I actually thought that was sort of taboo worldwide,

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:38.120
 but apparently particularly in India.

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:42.400
 - In lighter news, there was a great story today,

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:43.600
 which Andy showed me,

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:46.480
 which a dog that was lost in a forest

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:49.000
 was taken out of the forest, rescued,

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.200
 because a drone held off a string,

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:55.360
 a sausage for it to sniff and chase.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:57.360
 And I think it must have been its sense of smell

00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:58.760
 that was helping guide it, not just the visual.

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:00.000
 - Obviously it was its sense of smell.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.600
 - Well, you can see a sausage.

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:02.840
 You can see a sausage in there.

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:04.440
 - They held the barbecue on the beach

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:07.840
 to lure the dog towards a particular bit of the marshland

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:08.680
 to keep it safe.

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:10.440
 So it was definitely a sense of smell thing.

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:11.280
 - Hang on, I thought you said

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:12.280
 they were hanging a sausage from a drone.

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:14.600
 - They did a lot of things to find this dog.

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:16.160
 - How special a dog was this?

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.000
 - It's a very loved dog.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:17.840
 - Was it the Queen's dog?

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:20.480
 - It wasn't the Queen's dog, it was, yeah.

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:21.840
 - Speaking of dogs, actually,

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:23.720
 they have, obviously you have sniffer dogs

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:25.120
 in airports quite often.

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:27.400
 And there was a report in 2015

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.560
 of the sniffer dogs at Manchester Airport.

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:33.080
 And apparently in the previous 12 months,

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.600
 they had failed to spot a single person

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:38.920
 carrying heroin or cocaine over the border.

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:42.680
 But they had found 181 kilograms of illegal meat.

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:45.920
 (audience laughing)

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:49.760
 Small amounts of cheese, but no drugs.

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:50.600
 - That's so good.

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:52.120
 - There's a Dustin Hoffman quote

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:53.640
 that I always think about,

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:55.840
 which is to do with dogs as well.

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:57.840
 And it's attributed to him.

00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:58.880
 And I really hope he said it.

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:02.280
 But the line goes, if a lot of dogs are on the beach,

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:05.560
 the first thing they do is smell each other's ass.

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:09.200
 The information that's gotten somehow makes pacifists

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.240
 out of them all.

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:14.120
 I've thought, if only we smelled each other's asses,

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:15.720
 there wouldn't be any war.

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:20.480
 And I don't know why, but I think about that all the time.

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:21.920
 (audience laughing)

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:24.520
 - I am saying that is not one of Dustin's best.

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:25.360
 - No?

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:26.800
 It's not up there whether you try to seduce me,

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:27.800
 Mrs. Robinson.

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:29.560
 (audience laughing)

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:30.400
 Yes, you are.

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:34.560
 That's a cut scene from the movie.

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:36.840
 Dustin, stop sniffing her, please.

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:39.320
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:41.360
 and that is James.

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:44.280
 - Okay, my fact this week is that until it was identified

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:47.320
 by an art dealer in 1975,

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:50.480
 Donatello's bronze, the Madonna and Child,

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:53.800
 was being used as an ashtray and a tiddlywink bowl.

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:57.280
 So yeah, this was Donatello,

00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:59.040
 one of the, maybe the greatest sculpture

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:00.400
 of the early Renaissance.

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:03.360
 And he made this kind of bronze roundel.

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:06.000
 And these days, it's like one of the best things

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.200
 you can see in the V&A, one of the most expensive things.

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:12.880
 But we think, basically, it was given to this family,

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:15.680
 and then it was taken by a guy called Lord Malton,

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:17.960
 when he was on the grand tour, he bought it,

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:20.640
 he brought it back, and then generations and generations

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:22.400
 and generations of people in his family

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:24.680
 just kind of saw it as a little bowl.

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:28.920
 It's kind of, it's like a candy bowl, it's quite small.

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:31.440
 You might not know it was from Donatello if you didn't know,

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:33.360
 but then one day, they brought it to the V&A

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:35.000
 on what they call an options day.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.120
 It's a bit like Antiques Roadshow,

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:38.440
 where you say, how much is this worth?

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:41.120
 And they went, oh yeah, it looks like a tiddlywink bowl.

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:43.640
 Then a few weeks, a few years later, sorry,

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:46.280
 the head of the V&A was seeing this person and said,

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:48.120
 you know what, that's a Donatello.

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:50.480
 And they brought it back, and it's completely priceless.

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:52.120
 But they were just using it to play tiddlywink.

00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:53.680
 - So funny. - So funny.

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:56.840
 - That's so weird that you say it looked like a sweet bowl,

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:59.720
 because it sort of was.

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:02.000
 - It was a thing called a Desco D'Aparto,

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.240
 when Donatello made it, which is called a birth tray.

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:07.080
 And it's a tray that you fill up with sweets

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:10.080
 and you bring to a mother when she's just given birth.

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:12.240
 - 'Cause a birth tray sounds like a tray you would give birth on,

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:14.280
 and if someone showed you that tiny little thing,

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:15.280
 you'd think.

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:18.320
 - Yeah, I just thought we could talk about tiddlywinks.

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:19.680
 What do you think? - Yeah.

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.080
 - In all the different countries,

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:22.360
 got lots of different names.

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:24.200
 In France, it's called the game of the flea.

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.400
 In Croatian, it's called jumping flea.

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:28.000
 In Danish, it's called the flea game.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.080
 In Russian, it's called the game of fleas.

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:34.480
 In Spanish, it's called the game of the flea.

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:36.760
 In Ukraine, it's called game of fleas.

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:39.960
 And we call it tiddlywinks.

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:42.240
 And it appears that we got the word tiddlywinks

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:45.200
 from an unlicensed alcohol shop.

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.640
 - Really? - Yeah.

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:47.760
 - What do you mean?

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:49.600
 - As in the word tiddlywink used to mean

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:52.480
 a place where you could get beer, but it wasn't licensed.

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.000
 And then we kind of stole that name

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.560
 and used it as a game instead.

00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:56.640
 - Should we say what tiddlywinks is?

00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.000
 Sorry, for the benefit of any listeners

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.360
 who are not familiar with tiddlywinks.

00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:00.680
 - Okay. - Yeah.

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:03.080
 It's a little game where you have plastic counters

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:05.640
 and you have to sort of flip the plastic counters

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:08.120
 using other plastic counters into a bowl.

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:10.880
 And you can, you shoot a wink.

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:14.520
 And that's a, you have a special plastic

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:16.400
 which you shoot with, which is called a shooter,

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:17.960
 but it's also known as a squidger.

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:19.040
 You shoot your wink.

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:20.640
 And if you get it in the target, great.

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.080
 But you might fail to do that,

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:24.400
 but cover an opponent's wink, which is good.

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:26.880
 And if you've done that, you've swapped their wink

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:29.840
 and they then can't wink anymore with that.

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.520
 - Well, this all sounds very clear.

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:33.240
 - Yeah. - I'm glad you cleared this up.

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.440
 - It's full of a lot of really silly.

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.560
 - But actually that thing where if you,

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:40.280
 if you tiddle your wink onto someone else's wink

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:42.200
 and they're not allowed to tiddle that wink,

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:44.480
 that used to be really, really looked down upon.

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:46.880
 And you, like, that was really bad form if you did that.

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:49.000
 Now it's part of the game, but it used to be,

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.840
 you know, you'll, if you did that in the wild west,

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:51.920
 you'd get shot.

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:53.480
 (laughing)

00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:56.320
 And I'd love to walk into the salute bar

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:59.160
 where there's a poker game at one table,

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:02.760
 blackjacket at another one, and then the tiddly-wink corner.

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:03.800
 - And everyone's dead.

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:07.240
 - You know, you can also perform a boondock.

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:10.080
 And a boondock is when you free a squopped wink

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:11.920
 by sending it all the way away.

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:13.880
 So that's a boondock.

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:15.080
 - But how do you send it?

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:17.000
 So that's, a squopped wink is a wink

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.080
 that's covered by another wink.

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:20.280
 - Yeah, so you, yeah, so you, you--

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:21.120
 - How do you free it?

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:22.960
 - You free it by using your wink

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:24.880
 to fire at your squopped wink,

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:27.040
 and you knock the squop away.

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:28.160
 So you free your wink.

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:30.240
 However, there's another move then,

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:33.920
 which is a simultaneous boondock and squop,

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:36.160
 whereby you boondock someone.

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:38.360
 So your wink has been squopped,

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:39.920
 but you, you-- - But you boondock it free.

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:43.880
 - You boondock it free, but then your wink lands on top.

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:46.040
 - You squop someone else in the middle of boondocking.

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:46.880
 - You squop someone else in the middle of boondocking.

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.800
 - Yes, yes, fuck!

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:51.840
 And that, for some inexplicable reason,

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:54.280
 is called the John Lennon Memorial Shot.

00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:57.280
 (audience laughing)

00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:01.040
 - There are so many versions of it.

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:01.880
 That's what I love.

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:03.640
 So it's a big craze in the 1890s,

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:04.760
 and then it fell out of fashion.

00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:06.280
 But there were all these sort of

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:08.080
 late Victorian, Edwardian versions of it.

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:10.120
 So there's Tiddly Wink 10, there's Tiddly Winks Golf,

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:12.280
 Winko Baseball, Battle Winks,

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:14.280
 which is battleships with Tiddly Winks.

00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:17.680
 There's Pedro, where you have to get in,

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:18.800
 there's a clown's mouth

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:21.080
 that you're trying to wink your winks into.

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:23.960
 In 1992, there was Widdly Tinks,

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:25.360
 where you have to, there's a toilet,

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:26.520
 and that's the target.

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:27.360
 - Ah!

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:28.200
 - It is clever.

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:29.020
 - Yeah.

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:30.880
 - Well, it started as Tiddly Winks, of course,

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:34.760
 and then no one knows why the Vs fell out.

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:37.400
 But as I'm sure you all know here,

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:38.760
 it was Chris and Tiddly Winks

00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:42.760
 by Joseph Asherton Fincher, or Ass Heaton Fincher.

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:45.600
 A-W-S-H, I don't know.

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:47.400
 And he invented it in 1889

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:49.080
 and got the patent for Tiddly Winks.

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:50.920
 And I was trying, going through the British newspaper,

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:53.040
 I'm trying to pinpoint the moment

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:55.040
 that we definitively lost the D.

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:57.520
 And I think it's roughly 1920.

00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:58.360
 Okay, so you're interested.

00:31:58.360 --> 00:31:59.200
 - Oh, right.

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:01.480
 - But it really took off again with Oxford and Cambridge

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:03.840
 competing against each other in the '60s, didn't it?

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:08.040
 And it became a real source of pride for Cambridge,

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:10.760
 and they had this notorious match.

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:15.160
 And it was in 1958,

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:17.920
 and it was a guy called Peter Downs,

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:20.880
 who was head of the Tiddly Winks Society at Cambridge.

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:24.400
 And he wrote to Prince Philip saying,

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:25.600
 "Prince Philip, have you noticed

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:27.480
 "there's been an article written in the spectator

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:29.480
 "claiming you cheat at Tiddly Winks?"

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:31.600
 There was a satirical article that had been written.

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:34.480
 And he said, "Would you care to defend your honor

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:36.960
 "by playing us, Cambridge University at Tiddly Winks?"

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:39.040
 And Prince Philip wrote back saying very politely,

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:41.440
 "I'd absolutely love to, bit busy.

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:44.320
 "But perhaps I could nominate someone in my place."

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:46.360
 And he nominated the Goons.

00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:48.800
 So there was this bizarre match.

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:51.120
 The Goon show, which was Peter Sellers,

00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:52.560
 Spike Milligan, and Harry Seacham,

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:54.760
 it was the biggest thing on radio at the time

00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:56.440
 for the comedy show.

00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:58.600
 And the Royal Family were big fans.

00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:01.040
 So yeah, he sent them along to do it.

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:03.720
 - Yeah, which apparently they tried to get the Goons

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:05.840
 to play the Tiddly Winks, Cambridge had before.

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:07.280
 And so it was so great,

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:08.800
 they managed to get to the Royal Family,

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:11.880
 and they had a Royal instruction to go.

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:14.480
 So they had to, and they played Cambridge University.

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:17.080
 And I was watching the video of the,

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:20.040
 when the umpire kind of launched the big match.

00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:22.520
 And he read out a letter from Prince Philip,

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:25.760
 which I still don't know if Prince Philip wrote it himself,

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:27.440
 or if it was a bit of satire from the umpire,

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:28.640
 but I hope he wrote it himself.

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:31.600
 And the letter said, "Give my best wishes to both teams,

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:34.320
 "but try if you can to do it in such a way

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:37.280
 "that you convey that I wish the Cambridge team to lose."

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:39.880
 (audience laughing)

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:42.320
 Then I had hoped to join my champions,

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:44.600
 but unfortunately, while practicing secretly,

00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:46.960
 I pulled an important muscle in the second,

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:49.720
 or Tiddly joint, of my winking finger.

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:51.480
 (audience laughing)

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:52.480
 - And then in the end,

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:54.600
 unfortunately, Cambridge did win, didn't they?

00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:55.440
 - They did.

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:59.320
 - 120.5 to 50.5.

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:00.280
 - A walkover.

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:01.280
 - Yeah, it really was.

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:04.840
 The students were in full evening dress all the way through.

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:07.120
 The Goons were wearing yellow night shirts

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:11.120
 with a Royal Tiddly Wink tie on that.

00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:13.120
 And the game finished with Harry Seacum

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:15.600
 singing a special Tiddly Winks anthem.

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:16.960
 (audience laughing)

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:18.200
 - And it was a big deal.

00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:19.440
 Like, this was the big moment

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:21.760
 for the Tiddly Winks community in the UK.

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:22.760
 - Not for the Goons.

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:23.600
 They had bigger moments.

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:24.440
 - No, they offered Tiddly Winks.

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:25.280
 - But it was the big moment for the Tiddly Winks.

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:27.000
 - Or for the UK.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.720
 - Or for the University of Cambridge.

00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:29.560
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:31.760
 It was, but Tiddly Winks got a big moment there.

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:35.600
 And interestingly, so that was on the 1st of March, 1958.

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:38.760
 On the 10th of March, 1958, Spike Milligan in the time

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:42.000
 since the match, and the next Goonshow being recorded

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.800
 and going out, wrote an episode of the Goonshow

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:46.280
 called Tiddly Winks, in which after the hands

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:48.280
 of the defeated Cambridge, Nettie Seagoon,

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:51.480
 who Harry Seacum played, seeks his gameful revenge,

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:52.560
 and the whole episode.

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:55.280
 So again, broadcasting to millions and millions,

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:57.160
 Tiddly Winks became this big thing.

00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:58.720
 And there's a Facebook page,

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:03.280
 which is the official Tiddly Winks organization in the UK.

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:04.480
 They have a Facebook page.

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:07.000
 There's only about 400 people who follow it.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:07.840
 - Really old me.

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:08.680
 - Only 400.

00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:09.520
 - Yeah, but who thought it would be

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:10.920
 in the low hundreds of thousands?

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:14.400
 - Oh yeah, the content is slamming.

00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:17.760
 And there's a guy on there called David Lockwood.

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:19.240
 And he says, this is from his post.

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:21.360
 He says, "Prince Philip did more to expand

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:24.400
 "our noble game of Tiddly Winks than anyone else in the world.

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:26.880
 "I tell people that his sponsorship of the Goonsmatch

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:29.660
 "of 1958 created an extensive publicity.

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:33.360
 "And by the early 1960s, there were more than 200 clubs

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:34.560
 "in the British Isles.

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:36.600
 "Prince Philip continued to support Tiddly Winks

00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:37.560
 "through the establishment.

00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:40.240
 "He'd made a silver-wink trophy and he backed

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:42.240
 "the 50th anniversary in 2008."

00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:44.440
 So he was big.

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:47.000
 - It's one of those sports that I'm afraid America

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.600
 has trounced Britain at consistently

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:50.880
 for a couple of decades now, yeah.

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.360
 They're much better at Tiddly Winks

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:54.200
 than British people now, the British players.

00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:55.040
 I'm really sorry.

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:56.800
 There was an article in the LA Times in 2019

00:35:56.800 --> 00:36:01.640
 about the kind of Federer and Nadal of Tiddly Winks.

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:03.960
 They were called Larry Kahn and,

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:06.440
 oh, I think it's David Lockwood is the other one, yeah.

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:08.640
 Yeah, Kahn and Lockwood are the two.

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:10.520
 Anyway, 2019, they reported on this match

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:12.960
 that Kahn was playing in Cambridge.

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:14.640
 And I'm quoting directly here.

00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:17.320
 "He'd flown over from Washington, D.C. on economy.

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:20.560
 "Nobody asked for an autograph or to pose for a selfie.

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:22.600
 "Kahn's privacy hasn't been invaded

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:24.360
 "by being the most successful Tiddly Winks player

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:25.640
 "of all time.

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:27.320
 "The man who was officiating the match he played

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:28.920
 "in Cambridge, quoting here,

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:32.040
 "emailed the members of the English Tiddly Winks Association

00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:33.760
 "to encourage them to come and watch.

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:37.520
 "In the following five hours of play, nobody did."

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:41.520
 And that's him emailing the English Tiddly Winks Association.

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:44.480
 If they're not turning up, I know.

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:46.680
 That's sad. I think one of the reasons is

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:49.720
 because it used to be illegal to play Tiddly Winks

00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:52.280
 in the UK in a pub without a licence.

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:53.280
 -What? -No.

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:55.440
 In the UK in a pub without a licence.

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:56.200
 -Wow. -Yeah.

00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:58.720
 So there was a Tiddly Winks match.

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:00.040
 In fact, it was a marathon.

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:04.600
 The Tiddly Winks marathon over 15 yards at the York Beer Festival

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:07.200
 on the 3rd of November, 1970.

00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:09.200
 And this was supposed to take place.

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:11.920
 This was an article in the Daily Mirror that I found.

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:14.480
 But it was called off because the police rang up and said,

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:16.960
 "No, it's illegal to do that without a licence."

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:19.440
 Was this a gambling thing, or is it dangerous?

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:21.040
 It was for money.

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:23.360
 It was for charity, they were doing it.

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:25.240
 And they said, "There's certain games

00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:28.520
 "that you're allowed to do in pubs if there's money involved."

00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:30.720
 And Tiddly Winks wasn't on that list.

00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:32.320
 And so they weren't allowed to do it.

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:34.840
 And so they replaced it with a marathon of blowing peas

00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:36.840
 through a straw.

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:41.400
 Hang on. And that was on the list of things you were allowed to do in pubs.

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:44.520
 -Wasn't counted as a spot. -I see.

00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:48.240
 Actually, there is a genuine crisis in the world of Tiddly Winks happening now,

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:50.640
 and it's that there is a massive wink shortage.

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:54.880
 And it's a problem because most of the winks that are being used these days

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:56.040
 were made a long time ago.

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:58.720
 There are not firms making Tiddly Winks these days.

00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:01.280
 So even the Cambridge match I just mentioned from 2019,

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:03.000
 they'd be using 1980s winks.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.360
 -No. -Yeah.

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:06.720
 -Really? -What were we using with Tiddly Winks?

00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:09.200
 My winks weren't from the 1980s, and I was using them.

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:11.560
 The supplier has gone bust, so this is a problem.

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:14.960
 And there are hopes that 3D printing will save the day.

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:17.320
 -Right. -Fingers crossed.

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:21.960
 Well, I don't know if it is as young and vibrant as one might want it to be,

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:24.720
 because if you look at the list of Tiddly Winks champions,

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:26.480
 I think you mentioned Lockwood and Kahn.

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:30.440
 I would say they are more the Djokovic Nadal and the Nadal Federer

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:33.000
 are Kahn and Patrick Barry, the British...

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.240
 So who's the guy who doesn't like vaccines?

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:36.240
 Yeah.

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:42.920
 Look, they're all very well vaccinated, and it's social distance matches,

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:44.120
 and I have no idea.

00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:48.720
 But basically, Patrick Barry is a British chemical engineering lecturer at Cambridge,

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:54.120
 and he has been playing Larry Kahn on and off since they first met in 1995.

00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:56.880
 -Right. -So that's a good 26 years.

00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:00.040
 Even in 1995, Kahn had been going for 15 years,

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:03.120
 so he's basically been going for 40 years, this guy.

00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:06.560
 They need fresh blood, I think, in the Tiddly Winks game.

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:10.960
 Yeah, maybe. Patrick Barry is sponsored by a type of whiskey, isn't he?

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:13.800
 Yeah, basically, the whiskey company have decided

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:19.120
 that they don't want to sponsor Cristiana Ronaldo or Federer on Nadal or anyone like that.

00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:22.280
 They want a real person who is passionate about their spot,

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:27.800
 and so they found Patrick Barry, who is the world's singles champion at Tiddly Winks.

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:35.800
 Is it possible they looked at the cost of getting Federer to be sponsored to sponsor the whiskey?

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:40.400
 If you look at this 24-year-old whiskey from Cameron Bridge grain distillery,

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:43.840
 it has a picture of the Tiddly Winks champion on the label.

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:45.200
 -Amazing. -Awesome.

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:49.680
 Apparently, it has waves of vanilla, peppery spiciness,

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:52.120
 and the taste of pencil shavings.

00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:53.440
 Mmm.

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:56.680
 I think it's really exciting that this exists, and I think there should be.

00:39:56.680 --> 00:40:00.240
 When you read the Facebook page, and if you ever get a chance,

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:03.360
 I encourage everyone listening to go and check out Newswink,

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:06.240
 the newsletter by the official Tiddly Winks.

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:08.960
 -Have you read Winking World? That's another one? -No.

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:11.320
 -I haven't even gone there. -Winking World is another very good one.

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:16.080
 They recently ran a 12-page biography of Alan Dean.

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:21.280
 -No. How did they confine that to 12 pages? -Wait, I know.

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:23.360
 It's a genuine... Winking World 101 said,

00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:26.360
 "Most of your comments on WW100 were broadly the same.

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:30.960
 "This is all very well, but why isn't there a 12-page biography of Alan Dean?

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:33.480
 "Well, dear reader, I aim to please."

00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:36.520
 And there was a 12-page biography of Alan Dean.

00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:40.560
 It is time for our final fact of the show, and that is my fact.

00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:46.040
 My fact this week is that there is such a thing as bendy rocks.

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:48.000
 Mmm.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.120
 But this is, I mean, it sounds bullshit, but it's true.

00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:53.800
 There are genuine bendy rocks in the world,

00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:56.760
 so there is a sandstone, it's called Itacolomite,

00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:58.520
 and it's not found in many places in the world.

00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:01.240
 You get it in Brazil, you get it in North Carolina,

00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:04.240
 you get it in Georgia, there's a town in India,

00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:06.120
 you get it... I'm sure it's other places,

00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:09.280
 but they've only been found in sparse areas around the world.

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:13.080
 And this is a rock where basically you should watch videos online.

00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:18.080
 It wobbles when it's held on either side in a way that rocks don't.

00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:19.760
 And it's because...

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:21.480
 (LAUGHTER)

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:24.480
 It's because in the inside of the rock, there's quartz,

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:26.680
 and there's these interlinking bits,

00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:29.480
 these interlocking sort of bendy bits inside

00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:31.920
 that hold the quartz together, and there's voids in them,

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:35.040
 which means there's bits of space where they just find themselves

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:36.480
 having a bit of flexibility,

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:39.840
 but there's enough of them that the whole thing can bend.

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:42.640
 So it's not like if you're walking along the mountain,

00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:44.560
 you're on jelly the whole time.

00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:46.920
 It's not like that. You have to get quite a thin slab,

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:48.720
 and then you can see it wobble a little bit.

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:50.920
 Yeah, exactly. Yeah, and it's just...

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:53.680
 You know, if there was one thing we were certain of in life,

00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:55.120
 is that rocks don't bend.

00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:56.760
 (LAUGHTER)

00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:59.280
 So I was fascinated to learn that they actually do.

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:04.080
 And actually, interestingly, it turns out all rocks bend.

00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:07.400
 They just don't do it as quickly as old bendy may over here.

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:09.520
 What they do is, if you see...

00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:13.880
 And you can see rocks all over through, like, even on the side of cliffs,

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:17.160
 where you notice that they have this kind of bend in them.

00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:20.880
 Over many millions of years. Exactly, but over millions of years.

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:23.360
 A pressure, if there's a pressure on the side of a rock,

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:25.160
 it will slowly bend to the pressure.

00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:28.720
 Yes, it takes thousands, if not millions of years,

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:30.040
 but if you've got the time...

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:31.560
 (LAUGHTER)

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:33.400
 ...if you can bend any rock...

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:34.560
 Yeah.

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:36.680
 Is there a use for this bendy rock?

00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:38.480
 I'm sorry to be all practical.

00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:39.720
 Um...

00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:42.360
 Bouncy castles? Like, actual castles?

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:44.280
 What? Where you have the bendy?

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:46.280
 (LAUGHTER)

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:47.440
 Awesome.

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:51.600
 I'm not sure we have enough of it, or if it's been studied enough

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:55.680
 to know if it's useful for practical things like building or so on.

00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:58.960
 So the example that I've got on the screen here for the audience tonight

00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:01.480
 is from Leeds University. That's in their archives.

00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:04.080
 So they obviously send it to universities around the world,

00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:05.960
 going, "Look, a fucking bendy rock!"

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:08.160
 (LAUGHTER)

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:10.400
 So it's obviously a new... That's very cool.

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:12.760
 Yeah. Do you want to hear about another magic rock?

00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:15.880
 Yes, please. There are magic rocks around the world

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:19.280
 which are the opposite of seismometers, OK?

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:21.480
 So they tell you when there's not an earthquake.

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:23.480
 Bingo. Bingo.

00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:26.440
 I have a feeling I can do that anyway.

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:28.240
 You probably could. You probably could.

00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:31.080
 Is it when they're not moving?

00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:32.680
 That means there's no earthquake.

00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:37.720
 Yes, yes, but they're even more magical than that.

00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:41.640
 Imagine, they're called PBRs. They're precariously balanced rocks.

00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:43.120
 Oh, yes.

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:46.240
 They're rocks that look like they should fall over any minute now,

00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:49.160
 but they're still standing. And if you know, you know,

00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:51.920
 how long they've been there, they're reverse seismometers.

00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:54.920
 They tell you they haven't fallen over. There hasn't been an earthquake

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:56.920
 in that set period of time that they've been balanced.

00:43:56.920 --> 00:44:00.360
 So this is really useful, because if you want to build a nuclear plant,

00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:03.520
 you want to build it somewhere where there hasn't been an earthquake

00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:06.240
 for a very, very long time, or a bridge or whatever.

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:09.640
 So you build it right underneath a precariously balanced rock.

00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:12.440
 Exactly. Yeah.

00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:13.880
 And so these are really useful.

00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:16.360
 That's amazing, but aren't that many of them?

00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:18.920
 No, there aren't that many. It's not that useful, actually.

00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:21.800
 No, I say it.

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:25.440
 I can think of one, this isn't a rock so much as a virus,

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:27.960
 but there is a thing called a Medusa virus.

00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:33.360
 I think it might be useful in Bath, because it can turn amoebas into rocks.

00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:34.360
 Oh, really?

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:35.720
 Isn't that clever, yeah?

00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:38.360
 So when the virus goes into the amoeba,

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:42.120
 it kind of makes this kind of rocky shell over itself

00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:44.240
 and turns itself into a rock.

00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:45.800
 That's incredible. Isn't that cool?

00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:47.440
 But there's the amoeba still inside.

00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:49.440
 The amoeba's still living inside, yeah.

00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:52.080
 Oh, yeah. What a horrible way to go.

00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:53.680
 Yeah, that's great, though.

00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:58.760
 So Bath's Mark could become a rock pool, which would be awesome.

00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:00.640
 Is that a thing here? It's in Australia, yeah.

00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:04.280
 Yeah, we have rock pools in this country, yeah.

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:07.040
 Yeah, but we've also got watercress.

00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:09.520
 It doesn't mean we've all thought about these things.

00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:15.800
 I've got a magic rock to accompany yours.

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:18.400
 You can get rock, that is...

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:20.880
 I think we actually mentioned this once on No Such Thing As A News,

00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:23.480
 the long-lost TV show we once did.

00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:27.360
 But you can get rock that is as soft as butter,

00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:31.040
 that you put your finger in it and it bends like clay.

00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:33.120
 And this happened.

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:34.680
 It's quite rare, but it happens for instance,

00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:36.440
 cavers are told to look out for it.

00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:38.480
 It happens when people are making big quarries,

00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:39.640
 they come across it.

00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:41.920
 And it essentially happens when rock's being dissolved,

00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:46.240
 so limestone can be dissolved by very salty waters around it

00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:47.840
 or acidic waters around it.

00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:50.720
 But sometimes a bit of rock will be dissolved,

00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:53.280
 but then it will be surrounded by other rocks,

00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:55.800
 so the rock doesn't dissolve and then flow away.

00:45:55.800 --> 00:46:00.400
 It just gets trapped, this soft, dissolved bit of rock inside another rock.

00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:02.960
 And so apparently when you're caving sometimes or when you're quarrying,

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:04.280
 you'll tap through a bit of rock,

00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:06.440
 and then suddenly you'll think it's rock solid

00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:09.840
 and you'll put your finger in, just penetrates all the way through like magic.

00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:12.440
 - Why is that dangerous? - Sorry?

00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:15.040
 - Why is it dangerous? - Why is it?

00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:18.040
 - It's not? - Oh.

00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:21.240
 I thought you said that people were told to look out for it and stuff.

00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:23.040
 - Oh, no, it wasn't like... - Look out for it, like, you know,

00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:25.480
 look out for that adorable squirrel, you know.

00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:28.600
 - Ah, right. - It's not, look out!

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:31.160
 - Right, sorry. - Look out.

00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:33.160
 - Look out! - Wow.

00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:36.760
 Do you want to hear some rock-related words and maybe guess what they are?

00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:39.840
 - Yes. - So these are kind of mining-related, I would say.

00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:45.440
 So, can you guess what a bottom steward is?

00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:47.680
 - Bottom steward. - Bottom steward.

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:52.360
 Is Dustin Hoffman played this role, actually?

00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:54.880
 - Someone who looks after the lifts in the mine. - Pretty close.

00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:58.120
 It's someone who looks after the people who work at the bottom of the pit.

00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:00.920
 - Oh, okay. Nice. - Back ripper.

00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:05.000
 - Back ripper. - No, it's someone who removes the old supports.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:08.320
 So when you're going away from somewhere, you get all the supports from behind you

00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:11.520
 and then you put them in front of you, so you're ripping them away from the back.

00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:12.520
 - Oh, okay. - That's so clever.

00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:15.480
 - Do you know what a glory hole is? - Yes.

00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:21.600
 Well, I think I thought I did.

00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:26.080
 Perhaps they've got time for that sort of business down the bottom of a mine, though.

00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:28.600
 Everyone's got to let us steam at the end of the day.

00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:30.200
 - No, I've no idea. - If you have that rock

00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:33.080
 that you could just put your finger in, then maybe no, no.

00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:36.440
 Is it a way of seeing from different mining tunnels to each other?

00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:41.760
 No, it's just what miners call an extremely impressive excavation on the surface.

00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:44.360
 They call that a glory hole.

00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:47.240
 Can I just quickly tell you something about glory holes?

00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:49.240
 Oh, yeah, go on.

00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:51.600
 Finally, we're on that subject, are we?

00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:54.560
 I remember, so when COVID first kicked off,

00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:59.000
 the EU had a bunch of recommendations for how to avoid getting it.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:03.560
 And there was, and I was on the EU legal side of the website,

00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:07.360
 a recommendation that you take advantage of glory holes

00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:10.080
 to stop yourself from contracting the disease.

00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:11.760
 Um...

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:14.600
 Wait, that's how you have sex through, right?

00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:16.320
 - Yes, yes, yes, yes. - Yeah.

00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:19.560
 Yeah, yeah. And it's in the EU law.

00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:23.440
 It feels like there might be other diseases that you're leaving yourself open for.

00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:28.120
 I just saw people walking around with a dart, didn't you, with a hole in them.

00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:31.720
 I know that the oldest glory... We're just on glory hole facts now.

00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:36.920
 But the oldest glory hole in Australia is in a museum, I think, in Perth.

00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:41.080
 And there was a big argument about whether this should be allowed to be in a museum,

00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:42.680
 because, you know, it's a glory hole.

00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:47.720
 But they were saying, well, it's a really important part of the LGBTQ community

00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:49.600
 in Perth and in Western Australia.

00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:52.760
 I mean, how old is it? Is it like Caveman?

00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:54.760
 And is it an interactive exhibit?

00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:58.200
 LAUGHTER

00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:00.640
 Have you seen, Dan, have you seen those things at the seaside

00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:04.320
 where you put your head through and you get a photograph?

00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:06.840
 It's like that.

00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:10.320
 I know it's my fault we're on this, but let's go back to your raw vocabulary.

00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:12.600
 No, no, I was going to say...

00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:14.360
 Oh, do you know the word bougie?

00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:18.000
 - Oh. - It was a particular, fast-drying type of cement

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.080
 that you would pump into the bottom of a mine to give you a flaw.

00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:22.600
 - Cool. Really? - That was known as bougie.

00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:24.360
 - Yeah. Isn't that cool? - Mining is so cool.

00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:28.680
 Mining is... Some mines are so deep that the lifts can't go all the way down

00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:33.080
 because the lift cable is so heavy that you have to stop

00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:35.440
 because the lift would snap under the weight of the cable.

00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:37.840
 So you have to go down to a certain level and get into a new lift

00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:39.160
 and go all the way down to the bottom.

00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:41.880
 - Wow. - The technology that they have is just crazy.

00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:46.600
 So that's taller, like, it goes deeper than the Burj Al Khalif, for example.

00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:49.000
 - Well, no, I think they have to have more than one lift as well.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:52.760
 - Oh, there's more than one lift there, right? - Yeah, same issue as skyscrapers.

00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:59.320
 - Oh, wow. Tracey Eman, the artist, married a rock a few years ago.

00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:03.720
 - The rock are... - No, just a rock, sadly. Sadly for her.

00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:06.440
 She found a rock in her garden and she said, "I'm marrying this rock."

00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:11.480
 She was 52. She wore her father's funeral shroud for the marriage.

00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:14.520
 And she said, "It's not going anywhere. It will be there waiting for me."

00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:17.160
 And she said, "The stone I married is beautiful and dignified.

00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:19.200
 "It will never let me down."

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:21.120
 They divorced two years later.

00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:24.640
 - Do you know what's mad about that?

00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:28.240
 It's that I'm pretty sure I was reading an interview with Tracey Eman recently

00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:30.640
 and her mum wanted to call her "pebble."

00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:33.760
 I'm fairly certain that's right. And her mum really wanted to call her "pebble."

00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:37.840
 And I think the doctors at the hospital said, "We can't let you call your daughter "pebble."

00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:41.440
 - Because you'll be fucked up if you do. - What?

00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:44.400
 - Why would they say that? The doctors? - They said, "It's not a good name."

00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:49.440
 - They said, "It's not a proper name." - Well, tell that to Fred Flintstone.

00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:52.160
 Okay, that is it. That is all of our facts.

00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:53.760
 Thank you so much for listening.
