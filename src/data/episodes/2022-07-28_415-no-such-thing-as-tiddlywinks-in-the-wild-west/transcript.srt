1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:18,320
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,000
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast,

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,720
 this week coming to you live from Baaaaaah!

5
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,720
 (audience cheering)

6
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,680
 - My name is Dan Shriver, I am sitting here

7
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,640
 with Anna Tyshensky, Andrew Huntsomuri, and James Harkin.

8
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,800
 And once again, we have gathered 'round the microphones

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,000
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,480
 and in no particular order, here we go.

11
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,960
 Starting with fact number one, that is Anna.

12
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,640
 - My fact this week is that the reason you can no longer

13
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,800
 bathe in the Roman bars at bars is because

14
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,000
 they contain brain eating amoeba.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,080
 (audience laughing)

16
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:02,920
 - Wow.

17
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,760
 - So that, like, I was, I don't know,

18
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,040
 doing like a D-rate horror film or something,

19
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,120
 but yeah, it's true, there are amoeba in the bars

20
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,720
 that will eat your brain.

21
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,640
 - I must say, Anna, since you told us this fact,

22
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,760
 and we got to our travel lodge, your premier in,

23
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,480
 or whatever it was today, I was thinking,

24
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,880
 can I drink the water in bath?

25
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,720
 - I know!

26
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,560
 - Oh, yeah!

27
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,560
 - How do we need to address it?

28
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,560
 - I have a question about this,

29
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,920
 which is, Anna, I'd like to know,

30
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,760
 how do we need to address it?

31
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,600
 - I have a question about this,

32
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,720
 which is that I have drunk the waters of Bath,

33
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,600
 and I don't know exactly which ones I drunk.

34
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,960
 I imagine that--

35
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,400
 - Just some random bath water.

36
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,720
 (audience laughing)

37
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,600
 Actually, that's the problem with this fact,

38
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,120
 when you try and research it,

39
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,800
 if you Google bath water--

40
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,640
 - Yes.

41
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,880
 - All you get is someone called Belle Delphine,

42
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,520
 (audience laughing)

43
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,680
 who is apparently an adult influencer

44
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,880
 who was selling her bath water for $30 a bottle.

45
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,840
 - Oh, wow.

46
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,720
 - Okay, well, you shouldn't be bathing

47
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,120
 in Belle Delphine's bath water, or Bath's bath water,

48
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,360
 and it's not all the water in bath,

49
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,760
 it's just directly from the spring,

50
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,560
 so this was discovered in the '70s.

51
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,200
 I hadn't realized that until 1978,

52
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,880
 you could bathe directly in the spring,

53
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,280
 you know, when you're in the bath, baths in the museum,

54
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,120
 there's that bath.

55
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,840
 How many times do I say the word bath?

56
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,680
 (audience laughing)

57
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,280
 And I hadn't realized that people used to swim in it

58
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,120
 until 1978, and then they realized

59
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,360
 that coming direct from the spring

60
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,600
 was this amoeba called Nigleria fowleri,

61
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,520
 which is also known as the brain-eating amoeba,

62
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,680
 and you get it in warm, fresh water, it's very rare,

63
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,520
 and like I said, it's just this one spring,

64
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,840
 it's not in any of the rest of the water,

65
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,240
 and it burrows into your brain through your nose,

66
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,080
 so it goes up your nose

67
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,880
 and then burrows straight into your brain,

68
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,280
 and it's 100% fatal.

69
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,480
 - So that's okay, that means it's fine

70
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,400
 if you drink water, you're not gonna get it.

71
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,040
 It doesn't, if you drank the water,

72
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,760
 if you jumped into, and don't do this,

73
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,160
 but if you did jump into the bath spars

74
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,640
 and you just took down a lot down your mouth,

75
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,320
 but kept your nose out of the water, you'd be fine.

76
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,400
 - But then if someone made you laugh halfway through

77
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,280
 and it accidentally went up into your nose,

78
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,360
 - Oh yes.

79
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,200
 - It would murder you.

80
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,040
 - It came out the other way.

81
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,400
 - What is great murder mystery, though?

82
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,240
 - Yeah.

83
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,240
 What did I pay 50p to drink in about 2006?

84
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,520
 - That was just Evian, they siphoned it into a-

85
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,040
 - No, it wasn't, it tasted horrible,

86
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,680
 it tasted sulfurous, and it was strong stuff.

87
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,800
 - So sorry, what's the story, Andy?

88
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,640
 What's his story?

89
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,320
 - I went to the bath pump rooms in 2006

90
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,520
 and paid 50p to drink a glass of Frank,

91
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,320
 I'm sorry guys, horrible water.

92
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,480
 (audience laughing)

93
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,800
 Very clever, seeing it's magic, it was nasty.

94
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,680
 - I think this is the bit that doesn't have the amoeba in it.

95
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,400
 - So it's boreholed now.

96
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,000
 So basically you still get the really curative,

97
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,640
 brilliant waters of bath that feed the Roman barns

98
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,960
 and they feed, you guys have probably been to that hotel

99
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,000
 with the swimming pool on the top

100
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,520
 that's fed direct from the spring, which is very lovely.

101
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,240
 And that's just all through borehols,

102
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,040
 so it's not coming straight from the spring.

103
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,520
 So this amoeba is filtered out.

104
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,960
 - Why did you drink it?

105
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,640
 Why was the thing to do, was it?

106
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,360
 - It's advertised. - Yeah, you go to the bath,

107
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,120
 you know, the beautiful, beautiful tea room

108
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,760
 at the bath spa, and they say this is the water

109
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,720
 that people have been drinking for hundreds of years

110
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,520
 for its curative properties.

111
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,800
 - This is the water that hasn't cured anyone

112
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,120
 for the last 2,500 years, unless it's not cured.

113
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,200
 - What, so cure you?

114
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,040
 - It did, it cured a man called Bladdard,

115
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,320
 who was the whole reason for the baths being founded.

116
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,840
 And Bladdard, he had an infection basically,

117
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,080
 he had a Bladdard infection, and he was--

118
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,480
 - He had leprosy.

119
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,720
 - He had leprosy, yeah, he had leprosy.

120
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,720
 He was exiled by his family.

121
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,480
 He went to Athens, got leprosy,

122
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,920
 and then came back to England,

123
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,840
 was exiled by his family for having leprosy,

124
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,960
 and became a swine herd.

125
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,480
 But then his pigs jumped into the waters of the bath,

126
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,440
 which were coming up through the borehol,

127
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,040
 and they fronked, and they got better,

128
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,120
 and their leprosy was cured.

129
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,800
 So he built the city of Bath.

130
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,760
 So that's what happened.

131
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,800
 - And that is a true story.

132
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,120
 - Right.

133
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,840
 - He's like a semi-mythical,

134
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,760
 probably actually mythical king, isn't he?

135
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,640
 But he was like the father of King Lear, Bladdard.

136
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,840
 They first wrote about him,

137
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,800
 the first person to write about him

138
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,240
 was Geoffrey of Monmouth in the 12th century.

139
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,480
 And he wrote that Bladdard died

140
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,040
 when he constructed some wings for himself,

141
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,920
 and flew into a wall.

142
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,200
 (laughter)

143
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,040
 - Nice one, mate.

144
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,880
 - It's so good.

145
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,720
 - What a waste.

146
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,480
 - 'Cause it sounds like the wings worked,

147
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,000
 but it was a directional issue that...

148
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,480
 (laughter)

149
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,920
 - It was his sat-down, yeah.

150
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,600
 He was like, he was a necromancer, supposedly,

151
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,240
 and so he kind of, he got the, you know,

152
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,760
 the devil to make him wings, and stuff like that.

153
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,600
 - Wow.

154
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,440
 - That was cool, eh?

155
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,280
 - That was really cool.

156
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,200
 - So, just very quickly,

157
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,400
 because I think a lot of, you know, we're in Bath,

158
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,480
 and so everyone here knows what we're talking about,

159
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,120
 but we do have a lot of overseas listeners,

160
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,080
 and I know it is famous, but these were Roman baths.

161
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,520
 These were built by the Romans,

162
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,840
 and they used to go in every single day.

163
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,680
 They used to swim.

164
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,400
 There was an, in the city as well.

165
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,520
 There's been festivals.

166
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,320
 It's a big deal that, after the back of the '70s,

167
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,160
 no one can swim because of this amoeba,

168
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,360
 because that was, the city is literally named for it.

169
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,640
 It's called Bath for it.

170
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,560
 And, apparently, the reason that this amoeba came around

171
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,440
 is because there used to be a roof over it,

172
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,280
 and the roof has gone now.

173
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,600
 And so the sunlight has caused for this amoeba to find itself.

174
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,120
 This is what I read on a tweet, and, wow.

175
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,520
 But it was from a tweet from someone

176
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,560
 who felt like they knew what they were talking about.

177
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,360
 You know, there was a solid hashtag next to it,

178
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,120
 and it was a historian,

179
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,560
 but supposedly there was a big roof that was over it,

180
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,400
 and because that's not--

181
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,720
 - So what do the roof, the roof--

182
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,560
 - Stop the sunlight,

183
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,840
 and the sunlight is what was attracting the amoeba.

184
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,680
 - Wow, 'cause they-- - I see.

185
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,680
 - Well, they say that the sunlight

186
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,080
 is the best disinfectant, don't they?

187
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,360
 But except in this case,

188
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,640
 when it causes a fatal brain-eating amoeba.

189
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,760
 It's always the second half. - That's the second half, yeah, yeah.

190
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,360
 - He's in the small print of sunlight.

191
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,640
 - There was a guy who, in 1999,

192
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,240
 a naked man jumped into the baths in Bath claiming--

193
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,960
 he was claiming to be Julius Caesar.

194
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,760
 He jumped into the baths, and he refused to get out,

195
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,960
 and there was a big standoff, because--

196
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,400
 - Well, he's the emperor, you can't just drag him out.

197
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,480
 Can you? - Exactly.

198
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,600
 And they didn't want to go in,

199
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,040
 maybe because of the amoeba thing,

200
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,960
 but they had to unplug it and then wait for it.

201
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,080
 It takes three hours to drain.

202
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,760
 - Really? - Well, they drained the whole thing.

203
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,320
 - They drained the whole thing, and then--

204
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,800
 - Mate, just drag him out into the steps and murder him.

205
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,000
 (audience laughing)

206
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,640
 Do it the Roman way. - That's too suspicious.

207
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,200
 - I mean, it sounds so fun.

208
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,680
 I don't know if there's anyone listening.

209
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,840
 Maybe there is who remembers this,

210
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,640
 but they used to hold things called the Roman rendezvous,

211
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,120
 and they were held for four nights during the bath festival,

212
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,360
 and this was in the '60s.

213
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,200
 You'd pay five shillings, and it was a huge party,

214
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,880
 and you'd all just jump around and swim in the baths,

215
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,800
 and then you'd go and dance the night away in the pump room.

216
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,640
 It sounds so fun.

217
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,400
 Like, 1,400 people will go to this big old bath party.

218
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,760
 - Sounds amazing. - Yeah.

219
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,080
 - Someone remembers it.

220
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,080
 - That's a screen that's 40 years too young to remember that.

221
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,280
 (audience laughing)

222
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,680
 - Oh, the baths are so rejuvenating.

223
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,600
 (audience laughing)

224
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,520
 - Well, that's the thing, Anna.

225
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,320
 You said that no one was cured from it,

226
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,000
 but I've checked some local newspaper archives,

227
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,280
 and apparently there was a guy called William Toop of Froome,

228
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,920
 who suffered from paralysis

229
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,640
 after getting into cold water to gather watercress,

230
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,320
 and he was cured,

231
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,480
 and there was someone else who was bottling wine

232
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,160
 in a cold damp cellar for several hours,

233
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,360
 and they were cured of their palsy,

234
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,040
 and there was someone who got colic

235
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,000
 after drinking stale beer in hot weather,

236
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,240
 and he got cured as well,

237
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,560
 so, you know, that's evidence for you.

238
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,400
 - Yeah.

239
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,800
 - I'm not even sure you can get ill

240
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,400
 from bottling wine in a cellar for seven hours,

241
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,640
 let alone then get cured by a bath,

242
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,680
 but maybe, it definitely does actually

243
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,040
 have some curative properties,

244
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,520
 like things like arthritis.

245
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,640
 - Sorry, is that how you get watercress?

246
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,680
 You have to go into some water to get it.

247
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,080
 - That's the name.

248
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,920
 - Ah.

249
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,480
 (audience laughing)

250
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,720
 - I'm very interested in that.

251
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,560
 I'm sorry.

252
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,380
 - Did you think it just grew naturally

253
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:53,040
 on the painted clay heads of those little things

254
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,880
 you make in year seven?

255
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,920
 - Yeah, I thought it was just like Cress.

256
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,080
 It's just Cress doesn't grow in water, does it?

257
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,920
 I don't know.

258
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,760
 - Well, why do you think they cold it?

259
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,600
 All those years ago,

260
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,840
 why do you think they cold it watercress?

261
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,920
 I've never given it even a second thought

262
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,680
 in my life why I still watercress.

263
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,080
 - Well, I'm a busy guy.

264
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,240
 - Where do you think seaweed's from?

265
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,600
 But just out of curiosity.

266
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,600
 (audience laughing)

267
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,480
 - Okay.

268
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,680
 - The baths used to be prescribed on the NHS

269
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,800
 until pretty recently.

270
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,640
 - Really?

271
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,400
 - Yeah, yeah, they actually had a deal.

272
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,960
 Bath did this bath.

273
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,760
 Buxton, which for overseas listeners

274
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,320
 is another big spa town in the UK,

275
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,760
 had deals with the NHS.

276
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,160
 They had contracts where people

277
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,880
 would get prescribed water treatments

278
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,640
 and you'd go in and be sent there for back

279
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,680
 and joint pain and stuff like that.

280
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,640
 And actually in World War II,

281
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,680
 there were really cool pictures if you look it up.

282
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,080
 Oh, no, sorry, I think it's after World War I,

283
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,760
 they decided that sitting soldiers,

284
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,600
 wounded soldiers in baths for long periods of time

285
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,640
 would help them recover more quickly.

286
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,480
 And you can see hospital rooms

287
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,800
 where instead of lying in beds,

288
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,680
 there were just lines of men who were submerged in baths,

289
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,600
 which they had to stay in for up to 42 hours.

290
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,360
 - Oh, wow.

291
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,400
 - Imagine how wrinkly you go.

292
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,240
 - Yeah, it's bruised.

293
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,880
 - Yeah.

294
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,720
 - So the, I'm sorry,

295
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,760
 bath dimension of rivals, spa town,

296
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,000
 but Harrogate has a spa as well.

297
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,200
 - Ooh.

298
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,840
 - I don't know guys, it sounds pretty good.

299
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,760
 So some of the treatments that you'd have,

300
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,200
 these are from the '20s in Harrogate spa.

301
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,040
 The sulphur electric bath, sounds pretty good.

302
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:24,240
 There was the beat.

303
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,320
 - The old combining electricity with a bath.

304
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,160
 - That's right.

305
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,000
 - I don't feel quite right.

306
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,920
 - It's like another toaster, it will, you know?

307
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,120
 - There was the peat bath,

308
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,720
 which used fresh peat from the Yorkshire Moors in P-E-A-T,

309
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,120
 you know, the peat that you put on the garden.

310
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:38,960
 - Yeah.

311
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,800
 - There was also--

312
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,640
 - I didn't think you meant peat.

313
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,480
 - Someone called Peter gets thrown.

314
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,120
 - Hey guys, I'm here.

315
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,160
 - Fresh peat.

316
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,280
 - Room for another?

317
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,600
 - What about a bit of fruit?

318
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,680
 - But there was also electric peat,

319
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,640
 where they put you in a bath full of peat

320
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,200
 and just ran a current through the peat.

321
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,080
 - Every patient got a fresh peat, okay?

322
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,160
 'Cause you don't want to have someone else's peat.

323
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,480
 That would be disgusting.

324
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,480
 Imagine some peat that someone else has been in.

325
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,320
 Ugh.

326
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,680
 So they use 25 tons of peat a week.

327
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,760
 25 tons.

328
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,600
 - That's a lot of peat.

329
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,840
 - That's so much.

330
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:15,080
 Do you think all the people who are called peat together

331
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,360
 weigh more than the amount they used in a week?

332
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,720
 - If it's 20 tons, yeah.

333
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,560
 - Yeah.

334
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,360
 - By quite a considerable amount.

335
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,640
 - Probably, yeah.

336
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,480
 Probably the mass doesn't stack up.

337
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,440
 - I've been to a rival spa as well.

338
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,840
 I've been to one in Budapest.

339
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,600
 Budapest has the most thermal spas

340
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,520
 in the whole of mainland Europe.

341
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,920
 Some more in Reykjavik,

342
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,680
 but in mainland Europe they have it.

343
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,840
 Unfortunately, when I went there,

344
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,560
 I'd left my swimming costume in the hotel.

345
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,640
 And so I thought, well, I'll just buy one when I get there.

346
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,280
 But they only rent them.

347
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,840
 (laughing)

348
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,880
 So I had to rent a swimming costume in Budapest.

349
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,600
 The good news is that the baths

350
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,400
 are very good for skin diseases.

351
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,660
 (laughing)

352
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:03,040
 - So it just balances out, doesn't it, at the end?

353
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,240
 - But can you request size?

354
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,040
 Or is it like a school's lost property box

355
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,360
 when you forget your swimmers?

356
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,360
 - I think they just looked at me and went,

357
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,200
 peat!

358
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,520
 (laughing)

359
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,560
 Very extra large.

360
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,440
 - Have you guys heard of the bath curse tablets?

361
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,520
 - Oh, no.

362
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,560
 - Oh, this is very cool.

363
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,880
 This is a collection of 130 Roman-era curse tablets.

364
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,280
 And they were discovered in 1979, 1980.

365
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,200
 And the idea was if someone stole something from you

366
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,640
 in bath, you could go to these tablets,

367
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,120
 which were connected to a goddess.

368
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,400
 And you could say,

369
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,520
 I want you to take over the investigation, goddess.

370
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,480
 And you can smite the person.

371
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,600
 And so the idea was if they went to that,

372
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,280
 the person who stole the thing might return it,

373
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,000
 'cause they were freaked out that,

374
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,360
 you know, suddenly a goddess was on the case.

375
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,800
 - It was a very low crime solving rate back then,

376
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,640
 wasn't it?

377
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,120
 That was their method.

378
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,760
 - But it's amazing, 'cause there's one thing,

379
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,920
 and they're not too sure yet,

380
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,600
 but it's written in sort of Latin

381
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,480
 as how they wrote on these tablets.

382
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,200
 But they're also written supposedly in British Celtic.

383
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,800
 And if it's the case that it is,

384
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,640
 and they still don't know,

385
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,960
 if it is the case that it is,

386
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,760
 it's the only example of British Celtic

387
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,760
 that we have that has survived on tablet form.

388
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,120
 Yeah, so historians are trying to work out

389
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,280
 whether or not that is the case.

390
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,400
 'Cause I know some of them are,

391
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,480
 and this is a really amazing discovery,

392
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,320
 which goes to show that Bath is the bitchiest place

393
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,680
 known to man.

394
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,160
 Because the only things that were found here

395
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,240
 when everyone excavated the Roman Baths

396
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,960
 was all these tablets saying,

397
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,560
 "I don't like them, so they stole my hair clip.

398
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,040
 "I want you to kill them."

399
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,880
 (audience laughing)

400
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,560
 It was all such disproportionate stuff,

401
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,880
 like Dosey Meadis has lost two gloves.

402
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,960
 So this is Dosey Meadis referring to himself

403
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,160
 in the third person, so already a bit of a dick.

404
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,200
 (audience laughing)

405
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,600
 Dosey Meadis has lost two gloves

406
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,520
 and asks that the thief responsible

407
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:56,520
 should lose their mind and eyes in the goddess's temple.

408
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,600
 (audience laughing)

409
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,440
 Come on.

410
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,440
 - That's disproportionate.

411
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,280
 - It is.

412
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,520
 - Dosey Meadis.

413
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,560
 It's probably thought, no, after he died,

414
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,120
 everyone's going, "No one will ever mention that guy again."

415
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,840
 (audience laughing)

416
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,040
 Well, I think we've got to move on, guys,

417
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,000
 to our next fact.

418
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,240
 - Oh, I've got one little eventual

419
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,160
 that someone had in a bath recently.

420
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,240
 - Great. - Yeah.

421
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,760
 - Save your personal stories, Andy.

422
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,800
 - This happened in 2017 in Texas.

423
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,640
 This is amazing.

424
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,320
 This happened to a woman called Charlesetta Williams.

425
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,960
 She was in the bath, she's 75 years old,

426
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,440
 and a tornado hit her house,

427
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,200
 and it ripped the roof off the house,

428
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,200
 and then it ripped the bath out of its moorings.

429
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,280
 - And she was in there.

430
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,120
 - She was in there.

431
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,960
 - Wow.

432
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,120
 - She was actually, she was in the bath

433
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,400
 with her 40-year-old son at the time,

434
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,440
 and it was-- - Sorry, how old?

435
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,760
 - How old?

436
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,560
 - 40. - 40?

437
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,880
 - Well, they were-- - 40-year-olds.

438
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,360
 - They were sheltering from the tornado.

439
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,200
 They weren't.

440
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,200
 (audience laughing)

441
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,560
 Who was it?

442
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,880
 I presume.

443
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,240
 (audience laughing)

444
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,200
 - Unless, as someone's called Pete,

445
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,720
 in which case, completely normal.

446
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,800
 (audience laughing)

447
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,360
 When they land, the tornado ripped her clothes off,

448
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,200
 it must have.

449
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,200
 (audience laughing)

450
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,600
 - Come on. - How did that happen?

451
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,920
 - Come on.

452
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,440
 This is very upsetting.

453
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:26,280
 They were fine.

454
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,600
 He was, he was tossed out of the bath by me.

455
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,440
 (audience laughing)

456
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,600
 Come on, come on, come on.

457
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,160
 (audience laughing)

458
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,400
 - The wind speed was about 130 miles an hour

459
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,240
 of the tornado.

460
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,520
 They didn't end up that far away from the house.

461
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,960
 It wasn't like they ended up miles away.

462
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,320
 They were in the garden at the end of it.

463
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,280
 - And were they, okay.

464
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,000
 I mean, does it have a happy ending?

465
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 (audience laughing)

466
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:59,640
 - It is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

467
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,720
 - My fact is that there is a Spanish firm

468
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,080
 which has six official ham sniffers.

469
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,400
 Their job is to poke pork loins,

470
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,840
 sniff them and make sure they're good.

471
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,960
 And at most they smell 800 hams a day.

472
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,000
 - Well, I have a question.

473
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,400
 Don't they all just smell of ham?

474
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,560
 - Well, that's to you and me.

475
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,600
 They absolutely would.

476
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,760
 But to these amazing experts.

477
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,320
 So this, you may have seen this.

478
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,640
 It, you know, did the rounds a bit online before Christmas,

479
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,000
 but it's such an incredible fact.

480
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,160
 Is this Spanish firm called Cinto Jotas.

481
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,400
 And it's a company that they sell hams.

482
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,720
 And they're 150 years old.

483
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,120
 They're a very ancient lineage firm.

484
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,560
 They produce very traditional Iberian ham

485
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,200
 from, you know, pigs which have been fed

486
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,920
 on special acorns, this kind of thing.

487
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,320
 And they have trained workers

488
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,040
 whose specific job exclusively,

489
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,400
 it's not like I do this for a couple of hours a day,

490
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,320
 their job is to smell the hams

491
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,720
 to make sure they're good before they go on sale.

492
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,480
 And they have little kind of pipettes

493
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,520
 or little kind of jabbers to jab the ham

494
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,000
 in four specific places.

495
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,920
 - And then they have to smudge it over, right?

496
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,440
 It is the most amazing jobs.

497
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,880
 And some people will be qualified

498
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,800
 to sniff some types of ham, but not other types of ham.

499
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,640
 - Yes. - What?

500
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,480
 - There's more than one type of ham.

501
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,680
 - There is a guy who is really good,

502
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,000
 but he is not qualified to sniff a particular bit of ham.

503
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,160
 - Wow. - His father is.

504
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,760
 He hasn't yet qualified

505
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,560
 to sniffing that particular bit of the ham.

506
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,040
 So they have five seasonal workers at Christmas time,

507
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,960
 but there is one guy who sniffs year in, year out.

508
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,920
 And you have to do each ham in four places.

509
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,880
 So he sniffs 3,200 times a day.

510
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,760
 - Yeah, but that's in the high season.

511
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,560
 Like on a usual day, he'll do 200 and going to 800,

512
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:43,480
 so 800 loins a day, he'll do 3,200 sniffs.

513
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,280
 And he says even that is pushing him to the edge,

514
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,360
 to the limit.

515
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,520
 That's one sniff every nine seconds.

516
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,120
 - Yeah, it's insane.

517
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,560
 - Assuming the standard data working day.

518
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,800
 - Yeah, but if he's only doing nine seconds per sniff,

519
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,640
 that says to me he's not really doing a very thorough job.

520
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:01,240
 - Well, he accusation leveled.

521
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,480
 - Yeah, he's very proud.

522
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,160
 - He's called Mr. Vega, and he says the job that he is doing

523
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,320
 pushes him at the limit of human possibility.

524
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,640
 It's just, it's amazing.

525
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,480
 It was in the Wall Street Journal.

526
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,440
 It's just such a good piece.

527
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,440
 It's so interesting.

528
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,880
 - And they do say that if you can't tell straight away,

529
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,600
 then you're not doing it right.

530
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,040
 So they say it's really gotta be an immediate instinctive thing.

531
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,880
 - Oh, okay.

532
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,600
 - So, you know, really you should be doing more.

533
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,920
 - Yeah, they do tests where they take a smell

534
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,960
 and they put it into, so let's say they'll take

535
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,960
 five milliliters per liter of a smell

536
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,040
 and pop it into some water,

537
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,200
 and then they'll put it into plastic cups,

538
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,400
 and you'll have to then sniff the cup.

539
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,320
 And because a plastic cup,

540
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,120
 the odor of the cup itself will take over,

541
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,640
 there's a sort of time limit of about an hour or so

542
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,280
 where that starts taking over.

543
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,120
 So the younger--

544
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,720
 - I think it's, I thought it was a couple of minutes

545
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,960
 of the smell of plastic.

546
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,800
 - Oh, wow, really, okay.

547
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,640
 - Surely it doesn't take us an hour to smell plastic.

548
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,480
 - No, 'cause some of the smellers,

549
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,080
 according to the Wall Street Journal article,

550
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,640
 they take ages sniffing it,

551
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,400
 but Mr. Vega, this guy who pushes himself

552
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,240
 to the limit of human possibility,

553
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,280
 he says, "If you doubt yourself, you cannot do the work."

554
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,680
 And then, according to the article,

555
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,120
 taps himself on the chest,

556
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,480
 and he says, "If you doubt one,

557
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,360
 you have to doubt all of them."

558
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,800
 So he's like, "You've got to make your decision now."

559
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,920
 He's an amazing guy, yeah.

560
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,800
 - So was this also in the article

561
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,840
 about Christina Sanchez Blanco,

562
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,200
 who's the first woman to be head ham sniffer at Cinco Yotas?

563
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,040
 - Oh.

564
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,760
 - Because I read that she has such a good sense of smell

565
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,040
 that whenever her husband buys her a gift,

566
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,560
 she knows what it is before she unwraps it.

567
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,800
 (audience laughing)

568
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,640
 - Wow.

569
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,240
 - He keeps buying her cowl pads though, doesn't he?

570
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,520
 - Apparently, if he buys her perfume,

571
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,200
 he has to quadruple wrap it

572
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,640
 so that she won't be able to smell it.

573
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,680
 - That's so funny, good.

574
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,200
 I thought, yeah, I didn't realise at first

575
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,560
 that you were talking about things like perfume.

576
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,400
 I said, I thought she'd be able to say...

577
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,640
 - This is an Xbox.

578
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,840
 (audience laughing)

579
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,600
 - It's a book by George Elliot, I think.

580
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,640
 Hang on, it's one of the earlier ones.

581
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,400
 (audience laughing)

582
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,320
 But this, like, the accuracy of the nose

583
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,200
 depends on their exterior life as well.

584
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,640
 So Mr. Vega, talking of perfume,

585
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,360
 he says he wishes and hopes

586
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,960
 that his wife never changes perfume,

587
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,320
 because if she does, that alters his no-sense.

588
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,200
 Like, he went through a bit of a chaotic time

589
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,200
 when he swapped to a new anti-bolding shampoo,

590
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,320
 and that absolutely messed with his nostrils,

591
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,080
 'cause he was like, it was so potent,

592
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,200
 it threw him off and he couldn't do his job well.

593
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,920
 - Quite difficult people to be married to, really.

594
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,920
 So this poor woman either, you know,

595
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,400
 A, can't change her perfume,

596
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,880
 and B, her husband's now bald.

597
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,880
 And then Sanchez Blanco, Miss Sanchez Blanco,

598
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,760
 who you mentioned, James,

599
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,320
 she said that her husband's a policeman,

600
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,840
 and then at the moment he comes home,

601
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,320
 she tells him every day about the day he's had

602
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,000
 before he can say a word,

603
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,480
 'cause she can smell it on him.

604
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,640
 - What?

605
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,200
 - Whether it's like gasoline from a car crash, she says,

606
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,840
 soot from a fire, dander from a rescued pet.

607
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,000
 - God, you wouldn't risk having an affair, would you?

608
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,320
 - No.

609
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,960
 - Well, you might, if you had an affair

610
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,600
 with like a butcher or something,

611
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,000
 then that would be okay, wouldn't it?

612
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,160
 Because all they get is the smell of the meat,

613
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,600
 and just assume it was off their own clothes and stuff.

614
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,600
 - Also, in this quite small town,

615
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,440
 it sounds like he's having

616
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,000
 a much more action-packed police life than you should.

617
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,320
 Are we sure he's not just dousing himself

618
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,240
 to cover his affair with soot just before he gets home,

619
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,840
 or smothering himself in sausages

620
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,560
 to catch the sausage bang?

621
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,680
 - Do you know that Wafer Thin Ham has up to 25% water?

622
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,280
 They've recently done a study of this,

623
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,360
 and they found that like,

624
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,960
 when they get this Wafer Thin Stuff,

625
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,240
 most of it is actually water,

626
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,760
 not most of it, but like a quarter of it

627
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,120
 can be actually water.

628
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,960
 And so that means that if you have 100 gram pack

629
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,960
 of Wafer Thin Ham, which costs about 90p,

630
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,360
 that means, and it's 28% water, say,

631
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,960
 that means you're paying 25p just for the water,

632
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,080
 which means you're paying the equivalent of like,

633
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,760
 a five pounds for a very small bottle of water,

634
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,320
 that's the equivalent.

635
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,640
 It's only eight times less expensive

636
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,560
 than Belle Delphine's Bathwater.

637
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,800
 (laughing)

638
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,160
 - Gosh.

639
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,840
 - You know Linda McCartney, who makes vegetarian--

640
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,680
 - Yeah, yes.

641
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,320
 - Which she doesn't anymore.

642
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,840
 - But veggie, yeah.

643
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,680
 - Veggie stuff.

644
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,440
 This is, someone sent this as ages ago,

645
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,800
 and I just remembered it.

646
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,960
 She, the factory that makes her vegetarian fake meat

647
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,040
 is in Fakern Ham.

648
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,080
 - What? - No.

649
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,320
 - Fakern Ham.

650
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,160
 - No.

651
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,360
 - Yeah.

652
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,960
 So I don't know, did she choose it specifically?

653
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,800
 Did she?

654
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,640
 - That's amazing.

655
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,460
 - Where is it?

656
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,300
 Where's Fakern Ham?

657
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,140
 - Do you know, I actually,

658
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,560
 does anyone know where Fakern Ham is?

659
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,400
 - Oh, Fakern Ham.

660
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,240
 - Norfolk.

661
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,080
 - Norfolk.

662
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:34,920
 - Yeah.

663
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,760
 - Great.

664
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,600
 - Right.

665
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,440
 - Yeah.

666
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,280
 - Wow.

667
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,120
 - That's why we've never heard of it.

668
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:39,960
 - That's really good.

669
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,800
 (laughing)

670
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,640
 - Pro sniffing things, professional sniffers.

671
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,760
 This is a thing, and there are lots of,

672
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,440
 lots of different kinds of professional sniffer

673
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,400
 all the way across the world.

674
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,320
 So there are people who sniff armpits for a living.

675
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,520
 There's a man called Barry Druitt,

676
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,280
 who genuinely works for a firm called

677
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,600
 Princeton Consumer Research,

678
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,040
 and he's spent 20 years smelling armpits.

679
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,080
 - You haven't explained why.

680
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:03,920
 - Great point.

681
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:07,400
 Cosmetics companies send this firm,

682
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,760
 Princeton Consumer Research,

683
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,160
 all their products which have different active ingredients.

684
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,160
 So he smells armpits of volunteers,

685
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,000
 rates how smelly they are,

686
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,800
 and then they use the deodorant or whatever it is,

687
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,240
 and he will rate how well it manages to mask them.

688
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,120
 So a firm might have six different kinds

689
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,680
 of potential new deodorant,

690
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,240
 and he will assess which one is best.

691
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,880
 But he doesn't like smelling armpits, he said.

692
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,440
 He thinks they're disgusting.

693
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,920
 - Well, you know, a job's a job, isn't it?

694
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,760
 (laughing)

695
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,600
 - A job's a job.

696
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,520
 - You should have said it in the interview,

697
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,360
 shouldn't you?

698
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,200
 (laughing)

699
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,720
 What they said in the interview,

700
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,080
 do you like smelling armpits?

701
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,720
 He should have gone, no, I don't, actually.

702
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,280
 (laughing)

703
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,840
 - Well, if you liked it, that would actually be bad,

704
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,400
 because you wouldn't want a deodorant

705
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,880
 to mask the smell of an armpit.

706
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,720
 - That's a good point.

707
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,840
 He needs someone who hates the work.

708
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,680
 - Yeah, yeah.

709
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,960
 - But he doesn't have to do it nose-to-pit, as it were.

710
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,320
 He has these smell cones that he sniffs through.

711
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,680
 You get specific smell cones,

712
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,920
 which are for sampling smells.

713
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,880
 - And you put the pad under your armpit, don't you?

714
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,720
 I think people donate. - No, no, no.

715
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,840
 He goes into the pit.

716
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,680
 - He goes into the pit.

717
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,920
 - But he has got a cone kind of caught on sanitaire

718
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,000
 of little paper cones.

719
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,720
 - I see, 'cause sometimes they do it with an armpit pad.

720
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,000
 I think maybe if they've got a bit of extra budget,

721
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,760
 and there's a company called Cavern Care,

722
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,240
 which is an Indian cosmetics company.

723
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,440
 And they say they have a real problem

724
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,920
 with women's deodorant,

725
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:29,080
 as in they have a shortage of volunteers to donate sweat,

726
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,120
 because women, in particular in India,

727
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,160
 women is a bit taboo to donate your sweat to be smelled.

728
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,920
 I actually thought that was sort of taboo worldwide,

729
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,120
 but apparently particularly in India.

730
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:42,400
 - In lighter news, there was a great story today,

731
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,600
 which Andy showed me,

732
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,480
 which a dog that was lost in a forest

733
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,000
 was taken out of the forest, rescued,

734
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,200
 because a drone held off a string,

735
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,360
 a sausage for it to sniff and chase.

736
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,360
 And I think it must have been its sense of smell

737
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,760
 that was helping guide it, not just the visual.

738
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,000
 - Obviously it was its sense of smell.

739
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,600
 - Well, you can see a sausage.

740
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,840
 You can see a sausage in there.

741
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,440
 - They held the barbecue on the beach

742
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,840
 to lure the dog towards a particular bit of the marshland

743
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,680
 to keep it safe.

744
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,440
 So it was definitely a sense of smell thing.

745
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,280
 - Hang on, I thought you said

746
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,280
 they were hanging a sausage from a drone.

747
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,600
 - They did a lot of things to find this dog.

748
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,160
 - How special a dog was this?

749
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,000
 - It's a very loved dog.

750
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,840
 - Was it the Queen's dog?

751
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,480
 - It wasn't the Queen's dog, it was, yeah.

752
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,840
 - Speaking of dogs, actually,

753
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,720
 they have, obviously you have sniffer dogs

754
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,120
 in airports quite often.

755
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,400
 And there was a report in 2015

756
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,560
 of the sniffer dogs at Manchester Airport.

757
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,080
 And apparently in the previous 12 months,

758
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,600
 they had failed to spot a single person

759
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,920
 carrying heroin or cocaine over the border.

760
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:42,680
 But they had found 181 kilograms of illegal meat.

761
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,920
 (audience laughing)

762
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,760
 Small amounts of cheese, but no drugs.

763
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,600
 - That's so good.

764
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,120
 - There's a Dustin Hoffman quote

765
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,640
 that I always think about,

766
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,840
 which is to do with dogs as well.

767
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,840
 And it's attributed to him.

768
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,880
 And I really hope he said it.

769
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,280
 But the line goes, if a lot of dogs are on the beach,

770
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:05,560
 the first thing they do is smell each other's ass.

771
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:09,200
 The information that's gotten somehow makes pacifists

772
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,240
 out of them all.

773
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,120
 I've thought, if only we smelled each other's asses,

774
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,720
 there wouldn't be any war.

775
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:20,480
 And I don't know why, but I think about that all the time.

776
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,920
 (audience laughing)

777
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,520
 - I am saying that is not one of Dustin's best.

778
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,360
 - No?

779
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,800
 It's not up there whether you try to seduce me,

780
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,800
 Mrs. Robinson.

781
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,560
 (audience laughing)

782
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,400
 Yes, you are.

783
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,560
 That's a cut scene from the movie.

784
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,840
 Dustin, stop sniffing her, please.

785
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,320
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

786
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,360
 and that is James.

787
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,280
 - Okay, my fact this week is that until it was identified

788
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,320
 by an art dealer in 1975,

789
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,480
 Donatello's bronze, the Madonna and Child,

790
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,800
 was being used as an ashtray and a tiddlywink bowl.

791
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,280
 So yeah, this was Donatello,

792
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,040
 one of the, maybe the greatest sculpture

793
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,400
 of the early Renaissance.

794
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,360
 And he made this kind of bronze roundel.

795
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,000
 And these days, it's like one of the best things

796
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,200
 you can see in the V&A, one of the most expensive things.

797
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,880
 But we think, basically, it was given to this family,

798
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,680
 and then it was taken by a guy called Lord Malton,

799
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,960
 when he was on the grand tour, he bought it,

800
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,640
 he brought it back, and then generations and generations

801
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,400
 and generations of people in his family

802
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,680
 just kind of saw it as a little bowl.

803
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:28,920
 It's kind of, it's like a candy bowl, it's quite small.

804
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,440
 You might not know it was from Donatello if you didn't know,

805
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,360
 but then one day, they brought it to the V&A

806
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,000
 on what they call an options day.

807
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,120
 It's a bit like Antiques Roadshow,

808
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,440
 where you say, how much is this worth?

809
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,120
 And they went, oh yeah, it looks like a tiddlywink bowl.

810
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,640
 Then a few weeks, a few years later, sorry,

811
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,280
 the head of the V&A was seeing this person and said,

812
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,120
 you know what, that's a Donatello.

813
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,480
 And they brought it back, and it's completely priceless.

814
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,120
 But they were just using it to play tiddlywink.

815
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,680
 - So funny. - So funny.

816
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,840
 - That's so weird that you say it looked like a sweet bowl,

817
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,720
 because it sort of was.

818
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,000
 - It was a thing called a Desco D'Aparto,

819
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,240
 when Donatello made it, which is called a birth tray.

820
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,080
 And it's a tray that you fill up with sweets

821
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,080
 and you bring to a mother when she's just given birth.

822
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,240
 - 'Cause a birth tray sounds like a tray you would give birth on,

823
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,280
 and if someone showed you that tiny little thing,

824
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,280
 you'd think.

825
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,320
 - Yeah, I just thought we could talk about tiddlywinks.

826
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,680
 What do you think? - Yeah.

827
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,080
 - In all the different countries,

828
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,360
 got lots of different names.

829
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,200
 In France, it's called the game of the flea.

830
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,400
 In Croatian, it's called jumping flea.

831
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,000
 In Danish, it's called the flea game.

832
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,080
 In Russian, it's called the game of fleas.

833
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,480
 In Spanish, it's called the game of the flea.

834
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,760
 In Ukraine, it's called game of fleas.

835
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,960
 And we call it tiddlywinks.

836
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,240
 And it appears that we got the word tiddlywinks

837
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,200
 from an unlicensed alcohol shop.

838
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,640
 - Really? - Yeah.

839
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,760
 - What do you mean?

840
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,600
 - As in the word tiddlywink used to mean

841
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,480
 a place where you could get beer, but it wasn't licensed.

842
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,000
 And then we kind of stole that name

843
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,560
 and used it as a game instead.

844
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,640
 - Should we say what tiddlywinks is?

845
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,000
 Sorry, for the benefit of any listeners

846
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,360
 who are not familiar with tiddlywinks.

847
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,680
 - Okay. - Yeah.

848
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,080
 It's a little game where you have plastic counters

849
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,640
 and you have to sort of flip the plastic counters

850
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,120
 using other plastic counters into a bowl.

851
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,880
 And you can, you shoot a wink.

852
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,520
 And that's a, you have a special plastic

853
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,400
 which you shoot with, which is called a shooter,

854
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,960
 but it's also known as a squidger.

855
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,040
 You shoot your wink.

856
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,640
 And if you get it in the target, great.

857
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,080
 But you might fail to do that,

858
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,400
 but cover an opponent's wink, which is good.

859
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,880
 And if you've done that, you've swapped their wink

860
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,840
 and they then can't wink anymore with that.

861
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,520
 - Well, this all sounds very clear.

862
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,240
 - Yeah. - I'm glad you cleared this up.

863
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,440
 - It's full of a lot of really silly.

864
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,560
 - But actually that thing where if you,

865
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,280
 if you tiddle your wink onto someone else's wink

866
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,200
 and they're not allowed to tiddle that wink,

867
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,480
 that used to be really, really looked down upon.

868
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,880
 And you, like, that was really bad form if you did that.

869
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,000
 Now it's part of the game, but it used to be,

870
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,840
 you know, you'll, if you did that in the wild west,

871
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,920
 you'd get shot.

872
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,480
 (laughing)

873
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:56,320
 And I'd love to walk into the salute bar

874
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,160
 where there's a poker game at one table,

875
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:02,760
 blackjacket at another one, and then the tiddly-wink corner.

876
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,800
 - And everyone's dead.

877
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,240
 - You know, you can also perform a boondock.

878
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,080
 And a boondock is when you free a squopped wink

879
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,920
 by sending it all the way away.

880
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,880
 So that's a boondock.

881
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,080
 - But how do you send it?

882
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,000
 So that's, a squopped wink is a wink

883
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,080
 that's covered by another wink.

884
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,280
 - Yeah, so you, yeah, so you, you--

885
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,120
 - How do you free it?

886
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,960
 - You free it by using your wink

887
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,880
 to fire at your squopped wink,

888
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,040
 and you knock the squop away.

889
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,160
 So you free your wink.

890
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,240
 However, there's another move then,

891
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,920
 which is a simultaneous boondock and squop,

892
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,160
 whereby you boondock someone.

893
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,360
 So your wink has been squopped,

894
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,920
 but you, you-- - But you boondock it free.

895
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:43,880
 - You boondock it free, but then your wink lands on top.

896
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,040
 - You squop someone else in the middle of boondocking.

897
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:46,880
 - You squop someone else in the middle of boondocking.

898
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,800
 - Yes, yes, fuck!

899
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,840
 And that, for some inexplicable reason,

900
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,280
 is called the John Lennon Memorial Shot.

901
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,280
 (audience laughing)

902
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:01,040
 - There are so many versions of it.

903
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:01,880
 That's what I love.

904
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,640
 So it's a big craze in the 1890s,

905
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,760
 and then it fell out of fashion.

906
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,280
 But there were all these sort of

907
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,080
 late Victorian, Edwardian versions of it.

908
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,120
 So there's Tiddly Wink 10, there's Tiddly Winks Golf,

909
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,280
 Winko Baseball, Battle Winks,

910
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,280
 which is battleships with Tiddly Winks.

911
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:17,680
 There's Pedro, where you have to get in,

912
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,800
 there's a clown's mouth

913
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,080
 that you're trying to wink your winks into.

914
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,960
 In 1992, there was Widdly Tinks,

915
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,360
 where you have to, there's a toilet,

916
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,520
 and that's the target.

917
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,360
 - Ah!

918
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,200
 - It is clever.

919
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,020
 - Yeah.

920
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,880
 - Well, it started as Tiddly Winks, of course,

921
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,760
 and then no one knows why the Vs fell out.

922
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,400
 But as I'm sure you all know here,

923
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,760
 it was Chris and Tiddly Winks

924
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:42,760
 by Joseph Asherton Fincher, or Ass Heaton Fincher.

925
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,600
 A-W-S-H, I don't know.

926
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,400
 And he invented it in 1889

927
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,080
 and got the patent for Tiddly Winks.

928
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,920
 And I was trying, going through the British newspaper,

929
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,040
 I'm trying to pinpoint the moment

930
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,040
 that we definitively lost the D.

931
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,520
 And I think it's roughly 1920.

932
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,360
 Okay, so you're interested.

933
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,200
 - Oh, right.

934
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,480
 - But it really took off again with Oxford and Cambridge

935
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,840
 competing against each other in the '60s, didn't it?

936
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,040
 And it became a real source of pride for Cambridge,

937
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,760
 and they had this notorious match.

938
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:15,160
 And it was in 1958,

939
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,920
 and it was a guy called Peter Downs,

940
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,880
 who was head of the Tiddly Winks Society at Cambridge.

941
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,400
 And he wrote to Prince Philip saying,

942
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,600
 "Prince Philip, have you noticed

943
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,480
 "there's been an article written in the spectator

944
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,480
 "claiming you cheat at Tiddly Winks?"

945
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,600
 There was a satirical article that had been written.

946
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,480
 And he said, "Would you care to defend your honor

947
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,960
 "by playing us, Cambridge University at Tiddly Winks?"

948
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,040
 And Prince Philip wrote back saying very politely,

949
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,440
 "I'd absolutely love to, bit busy.

950
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,320
 "But perhaps I could nominate someone in my place."

951
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,360
 And he nominated the Goons.

952
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,800
 So there was this bizarre match.

953
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,120
 The Goon show, which was Peter Sellers,

954
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,560
 Spike Milligan, and Harry Seacham,

955
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,760
 it was the biggest thing on radio at the time

956
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,440
 for the comedy show.

957
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,600
 And the Royal Family were big fans.

958
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,040
 So yeah, he sent them along to do it.

959
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,720
 - Yeah, which apparently they tried to get the Goons

960
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,840
 to play the Tiddly Winks, Cambridge had before.

961
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,280
 And so it was so great,

962
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,800
 they managed to get to the Royal Family,

963
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,880
 and they had a Royal instruction to go.

964
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,480
 So they had to, and they played Cambridge University.

965
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,080
 And I was watching the video of the,

966
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:20,040
 when the umpire kind of launched the big match.

967
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,520
 And he read out a letter from Prince Philip,

968
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,760
 which I still don't know if Prince Philip wrote it himself,

969
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,440
 or if it was a bit of satire from the umpire,

970
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,640
 but I hope he wrote it himself.

971
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,600
 And the letter said, "Give my best wishes to both teams,

972
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,320
 "but try if you can to do it in such a way

973
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,280
 "that you convey that I wish the Cambridge team to lose."

974
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,880
 (audience laughing)

975
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,320
 Then I had hoped to join my champions,

976
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,600
 but unfortunately, while practicing secretly,

977
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,960
 I pulled an important muscle in the second,

978
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,720
 or Tiddly joint, of my winking finger.

979
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,480
 (audience laughing)

980
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,480
 - And then in the end,

981
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,600
 unfortunately, Cambridge did win, didn't they?

982
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,440
 - They did.

983
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,320
 - 120.5 to 50.5.

984
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,280
 - A walkover.

985
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,280
 - Yeah, it really was.

986
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,840
 The students were in full evening dress all the way through.

987
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,120
 The Goons were wearing yellow night shirts

988
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:11,120
 with a Royal Tiddly Wink tie on that.

989
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,120
 And the game finished with Harry Seacum

990
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,600
 singing a special Tiddly Winks anthem.

991
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,960
 (audience laughing)

992
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,200
 - And it was a big deal.

993
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,440
 Like, this was the big moment

994
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,760
 for the Tiddly Winks community in the UK.

995
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,760
 - Not for the Goons.

996
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,600
 They had bigger moments.

997
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,440
 - No, they offered Tiddly Winks.

998
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,280
 - But it was the big moment for the Tiddly Winks.

999
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,000
 - Or for the UK.

1000
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,720
 - Or for the University of Cambridge.

1001
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,560
 - Yeah, yeah.

1002
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,760
 It was, but Tiddly Winks got a big moment there.

1003
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,600
 And interestingly, so that was on the 1st of March, 1958.

1004
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,760
 On the 10th of March, 1958, Spike Milligan in the time

1005
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:42,000
 since the match, and the next Goonshow being recorded

1006
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,800
 and going out, wrote an episode of the Goonshow

1007
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,280
 called Tiddly Winks, in which after the hands

1008
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,280
 of the defeated Cambridge, Nettie Seagoon,

1009
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:51,480
 who Harry Seacum played, seeks his gameful revenge,

1010
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,560
 and the whole episode.

1011
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,280
 So again, broadcasting to millions and millions,

1012
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,160
 Tiddly Winks became this big thing.

1013
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,720
 And there's a Facebook page,

1014
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:03,280
 which is the official Tiddly Winks organization in the UK.

1015
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,480
 They have a Facebook page.

1016
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,000
 There's only about 400 people who follow it.

1017
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,840
 - Really old me.

1018
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,680
 - Only 400.

1019
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,520
 - Yeah, but who thought it would be

1020
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,920
 in the low hundreds of thousands?

1021
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,400
 - Oh yeah, the content is slamming.

1022
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,760
 And there's a guy on there called David Lockwood.

1023
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,240
 And he says, this is from his post.

1024
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,360
 He says, "Prince Philip did more to expand

1025
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,400
 "our noble game of Tiddly Winks than anyone else in the world.

1026
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,880
 "I tell people that his sponsorship of the Goonsmatch

1027
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,660
 "of 1958 created an extensive publicity.

1028
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:33,360
 "And by the early 1960s, there were more than 200 clubs

1029
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,560
 "in the British Isles.

1030
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,600
 "Prince Philip continued to support Tiddly Winks

1031
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,560
 "through the establishment.

1032
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,240
 "He'd made a silver-wink trophy and he backed

1033
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,240
 "the 50th anniversary in 2008."

1034
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,440
 So he was big.

1035
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,000
 - It's one of those sports that I'm afraid America

1036
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,600
 has trounced Britain at consistently

1037
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,880
 for a couple of decades now, yeah.

1038
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,360
 They're much better at Tiddly Winks

1039
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,200
 than British people now, the British players.

1040
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,040
 I'm really sorry.

1041
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,800
 There was an article in the LA Times in 2019

1042
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,640
 about the kind of Federer and Nadal of Tiddly Winks.

1043
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,960
 They were called Larry Kahn and,

1044
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,440
 oh, I think it's David Lockwood is the other one, yeah.

1045
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,640
 Yeah, Kahn and Lockwood are the two.

1046
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,520
 Anyway, 2019, they reported on this match

1047
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,960
 that Kahn was playing in Cambridge.

1048
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,640
 And I'm quoting directly here.

1049
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,320
 "He'd flown over from Washington, D.C. on economy.

1050
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:20,560
 "Nobody asked for an autograph or to pose for a selfie.

1051
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,600
 "Kahn's privacy hasn't been invaded

1052
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,360
 "by being the most successful Tiddly Winks player

1053
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,640
 "of all time.

1054
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,320
 "The man who was officiating the match he played

1055
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,920
 "in Cambridge, quoting here,

00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,760

1058
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,520
 "In the following five hours of play, nobody did."

1059
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,520
 And that's him emailing the English Tiddly Winks Association.

1060
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,480
 If they're not turning up, I know.

1061
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,680
 That's sad. I think one of the reasons is

1062
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,720
 because it used to be illegal to play Tiddly Winks

1063
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,280
 in the UK in a pub without a licence.

1064
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,280
 -What? -No.

1065
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,440
 In the UK in a pub without a licence.

1066
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,200
 -Wow. -Yeah.

1067
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,720
 So there was a Tiddly Winks match.

1068
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,040
 In fact, it was a marathon.

1069
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:04,600
 The Tiddly Winks marathon over 15 yards at the York Beer Festival

1070
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,200
 on the 3rd of November, 1970.

1071
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,200
 And this was supposed to take place.

1072
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,920
 This was an article in the Daily Mirror that I found.

1073
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,480
 But it was called off because the police rang up and said,

1074
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,960
 "No, it's illegal to do that without a licence."

1075
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,440
 Was this a gambling thing, or is it dangerous?

1076
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,040
 It was for money.

1077
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,360
 It was for charity, they were doing it.

1078
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,240
 And they said, "There's certain games

1079
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:28,520
 "that you're allowed to do in pubs if there's money involved."

1080
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,720
 And Tiddly Winks wasn't on that list.

1081
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,320
 And so they weren't allowed to do it.

1082
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,840
 And so they replaced it with a marathon of blowing peas

1083
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,840
 through a straw.

1084
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:41,400
 Hang on. And that was on the list of things you were allowed to do in pubs.

1085
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,520
 -Wasn't counted as a spot. -I see.

1086
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:48,240
 Actually, there is a genuine crisis in the world of Tiddly Winks happening now,

1087
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,640
 and it's that there is a massive wink shortage.

1088
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,880
 And it's a problem because most of the winks that are being used these days

1089
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,040
 were made a long time ago.

1090
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,720
 There are not firms making Tiddly Winks these days.

1091
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,280
 So even the Cambridge match I just mentioned from 2019,

1092
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,000
 they'd be using 1980s winks.

1093
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,360
 -No. -Yeah.

1094
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,720
 -Really? -What were we using with Tiddly Winks?

1095
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,200
 My winks weren't from the 1980s, and I was using them.

1096
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,560
 The supplier has gone bust, so this is a problem.

1097
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,960
 And there are hopes that 3D printing will save the day.

1098
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,320
 -Right. -Fingers crossed.

1099
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:21,960
 Well, I don't know if it is as young and vibrant as one might want it to be,

1100
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,720
 because if you look at the list of Tiddly Winks champions,

1101
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,480
 I think you mentioned Lockwood and Kahn.

1102
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,440
 I would say they are more the Djokovic Nadal and the Nadal Federer

1103
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,000
 are Kahn and Patrick Barry, the British...

1104
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,240
 So who's the guy who doesn't like vaccines?

1105
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,240
 Yeah.

1106
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:42,920
 Look, they're all very well vaccinated, and it's social distance matches,

1107
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,120
 and I have no idea.

1108
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:48,720
 But basically, Patrick Barry is a British chemical engineering lecturer at Cambridge,

1109
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:54,120
 and he has been playing Larry Kahn on and off since they first met in 1995.

1110
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,880
 -Right. -So that's a good 26 years.

1111
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,040
 Even in 1995, Kahn had been going for 15 years,

1112
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,120
 so he's basically been going for 40 years, this guy.

1113
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:06,560
 They need fresh blood, I think, in the Tiddly Winks game.

1114
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,960
 Yeah, maybe. Patrick Barry is sponsored by a type of whiskey, isn't he?

1115
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,800
 Yeah, basically, the whiskey company have decided

1116
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:19,120
 that they don't want to sponsor Cristiana Ronaldo or Federer on Nadal or anyone like that.

1117
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,280
 They want a real person who is passionate about their spot,

1118
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:27,800
 and so they found Patrick Barry, who is the world's singles champion at Tiddly Winks.

1119
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:35,800
 Is it possible they looked at the cost of getting Federer to be sponsored to sponsor the whiskey?

1120
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:40,400
 If you look at this 24-year-old whiskey from Cameron Bridge grain distillery,

1121
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,840
 it has a picture of the Tiddly Winks champion on the label.

1122
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,200
 -Amazing. -Awesome.

1123
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,680
 Apparently, it has waves of vanilla, peppery spiciness,

1124
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,120
 and the taste of pencil shavings.

1125
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,440
 Mmm.

1126
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,680
 I think it's really exciting that this exists, and I think there should be.

1127
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:00,240
 When you read the Facebook page, and if you ever get a chance,

1128
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,360
 I encourage everyone listening to go and check out Newswink,

1129
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,240
 the newsletter by the official Tiddly Winks.

1130
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,960
 -Have you read Winking World? That's another one? -No.

1131
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,320
 -I haven't even gone there. -Winking World is another very good one.

1132
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:16,080
 They recently ran a 12-page biography of Alan Dean.

1133
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:21,280
 -No. How did they confine that to 12 pages? -Wait, I know.

1134
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,360
 It's a genuine... Winking World 101 said,

1135
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,360
 "Most of your comments on WW100 were broadly the same.

1136
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:30,960
 "This is all very well, but why isn't there a 12-page biography of Alan Dean?

1137
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,480
 "Well, dear reader, I aim to please."

1138
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,520
 And there was a 12-page biography of Alan Dean.

1139
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:40,560
 It is time for our final fact of the show, and that is my fact.

1140
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:46,040
 My fact this week is that there is such a thing as bendy rocks.

1141
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,000
 Mmm.

1142
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,120
 But this is, I mean, it sounds bullshit, but it's true.

1143
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,800
 There are genuine bendy rocks in the world,

1144
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,760
 so there is a sandstone, it's called Itacolomite,

1145
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,520
 and it's not found in many places in the world.

1146
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:01,240
 You get it in Brazil, you get it in North Carolina,

1147
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:04,240
 you get it in Georgia, there's a town in India,

1148
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,120
 you get it... I'm sure it's other places,

1149
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:09,280
 but they've only been found in sparse areas around the world.

1150
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:13,080
 And this is a rock where basically you should watch videos online.

1151
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:18,080
 It wobbles when it's held on either side in a way that rocks don't.

1152
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,760
 And it's because...

1153
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,480
 (LAUGHTER)

1154
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,480
 It's because in the inside of the rock, there's quartz,

1155
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,680
 and there's these interlinking bits,

1156
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:29,480
 these interlocking sort of bendy bits inside

1157
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,920
 that hold the quartz together, and there's voids in them,

1158
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,040
 which means there's bits of space where they just find themselves

1159
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,480
 having a bit of flexibility,

1160
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,840
 but there's enough of them that the whole thing can bend.

1161
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,640
 So it's not like if you're walking along the mountain,

1162
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,560
 you're on jelly the whole time.

1163
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,920
 It's not like that. You have to get quite a thin slab,

1164
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,720
 and then you can see it wobble a little bit.

1165
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,920
 Yeah, exactly. Yeah, and it's just...

1166
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,680
 You know, if there was one thing we were certain of in life,

1167
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,120
 is that rocks don't bend.

1168
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,760
 (LAUGHTER)

1169
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,280
 So I was fascinated to learn that they actually do.

1170
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:04,080
 And actually, interestingly, it turns out all rocks bend.

1171
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:07,400
 They just don't do it as quickly as old bendy may over here.

1172
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,520
 What they do is, if you see...

1173
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:13,880
 And you can see rocks all over through, like, even on the side of cliffs,

1174
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:17,160
 where you notice that they have this kind of bend in them.

1175
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,880
 Over many millions of years. Exactly, but over millions of years.

1176
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,360
 A pressure, if there's a pressure on the side of a rock,

1177
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,160
 it will slowly bend to the pressure.

1178
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:28,720
 Yes, it takes thousands, if not millions of years,

1179
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,040
 but if you've got the time...

1180
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,560
 (LAUGHTER)

1181
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,400
 ...if you can bend any rock...

1182
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,560
 Yeah.

1183
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,680
 Is there a use for this bendy rock?

1184
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,480
 I'm sorry to be all practical.

1185
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,720
 Um...

1186
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:42,360
 Bouncy castles? Like, actual castles?

1187
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,280
 What? Where you have the bendy?

1188
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,280
 (LAUGHTER)

1189
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,440
 Awesome.

1190
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,600
 I'm not sure we have enough of it, or if it's been studied enough

1191
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:55,680
 to know if it's useful for practical things like building or so on.

1192
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,960
 So the example that I've got on the screen here for the audience tonight

1193
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,480
 is from Leeds University. That's in their archives.

1194
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,080
 So they obviously send it to universities around the world,

1195
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,960
 going, "Look, a fucking bendy rock!"

1196
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,160
 (LAUGHTER)

1197
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,400
 So it's obviously a new... That's very cool.

1198
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,760
 Yeah. Do you want to hear about another magic rock?

1199
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,880
 Yes, please. There are magic rocks around the world

1200
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:19,280
 which are the opposite of seismometers, OK?

1201
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,480
 So they tell you when there's not an earthquake.

1202
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,480
 Bingo. Bingo.

1203
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:26,440
 I have a feeling I can do that anyway.

1204
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,240
 You probably could. You probably could.

1205
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,080
 Is it when they're not moving?

1206
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,680
 That means there's no earthquake.

1207
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:37,720
 Yes, yes, but they're even more magical than that.

1208
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:41,640
 Imagine, they're called PBRs. They're precariously balanced rocks.

1209
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,120
 Oh, yes.

1210
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,240
 They're rocks that look like they should fall over any minute now,

1211
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,160
 but they're still standing. And if you know, you know,

1212
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,920
 how long they've been there, they're reverse seismometers.

1213
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,920
 They tell you they haven't fallen over. There hasn't been an earthquake

1214
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,920
 in that set period of time that they've been balanced.

1215
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:00,360
 So this is really useful, because if you want to build a nuclear plant,

1216
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:03,520
 you want to build it somewhere where there hasn't been an earthquake

1217
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,240
 for a very, very long time, or a bridge or whatever.

1218
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,640
 So you build it right underneath a precariously balanced rock.

1219
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,440
 Exactly. Yeah.

1220
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,880
 And so these are really useful.

1221
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:16,360
 That's amazing, but aren't that many of them?

1222
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,920
 No, there aren't that many. It's not that useful, actually.

1223
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:21,800
 No, I say it.

1224
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:25,440
 I can think of one, this isn't a rock so much as a virus,

1225
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,960
 but there is a thing called a Medusa virus.

1226
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:33,360
 I think it might be useful in Bath, because it can turn amoebas into rocks.

1227
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,360
 Oh, really?

1228
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:35,720
 Isn't that clever, yeah?

1229
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:38,360
 So when the virus goes into the amoeba,

1230
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:42,120
 it kind of makes this kind of rocky shell over itself

1231
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,240
 and turns itself into a rock.

1232
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,800
 That's incredible. Isn't that cool?

1233
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,440
 But there's the amoeba still inside.

1234
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,440
 The amoeba's still living inside, yeah.

1235
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,080
 Oh, yeah. What a horrible way to go.

1236
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,680
 Yeah, that's great, though.

1237
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:58,760
 So Bath's Mark could become a rock pool, which would be awesome.

1238
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,640
 Is that a thing here? It's in Australia, yeah.

1239
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:04,280
 Yeah, we have rock pools in this country, yeah.

1240
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:07,040
 Yeah, but we've also got watercress.

1241
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,520
 It doesn't mean we've all thought about these things.

1242
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:15,800
 I've got a magic rock to accompany yours.

1243
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,400
 You can get rock, that is...

1244
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,880
 I think we actually mentioned this once on No Such Thing As A News,

1245
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,480
 the long-lost TV show we once did.

1246
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:27,360
 But you can get rock that is as soft as butter,

1247
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:31,040
 that you put your finger in it and it bends like clay.

1248
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,120
 And this happened.

1249
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,680
 It's quite rare, but it happens for instance,

1250
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,440
 cavers are told to look out for it.

1251
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,480
 It happens when people are making big quarries,

1252
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,640
 they come across it.

1253
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,920
 And it essentially happens when rock's being dissolved,

1254
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:46,240
 so limestone can be dissolved by very salty waters around it

1255
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,840
 or acidic waters around it.

1256
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:50,720
 But sometimes a bit of rock will be dissolved,

1257
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,280
 but then it will be surrounded by other rocks,

1258
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,800
 so the rock doesn't dissolve and then flow away.

1259
00:45:55,800 --> 00:46:00,400
 It just gets trapped, this soft, dissolved bit of rock inside another rock.

1260
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,960
 And so apparently when you're caving sometimes or when you're quarrying,

1261
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,280
 you'll tap through a bit of rock,

1262
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,440
 and then suddenly you'll think it's rock solid

1263
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:09,840
 and you'll put your finger in, just penetrates all the way through like magic.

1264
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:12,440
 - Why is that dangerous? - Sorry?

1265
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,040
 - Why is it dangerous? - Why is it?

1266
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:18,040
 - It's not? - Oh.

1267
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:21,240
 I thought you said that people were told to look out for it and stuff.

1268
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,040
 - Oh, no, it wasn't like... - Look out for it, like, you know,

1269
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,480
 look out for that adorable squirrel, you know.

1270
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:28,600
 - Ah, right. - It's not, look out!

1271
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,160
 - Right, sorry. - Look out.

1272
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,160
 - Look out! - Wow.

1273
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:36,760
 Do you want to hear some rock-related words and maybe guess what they are?

1274
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,840
 - Yes. - So these are kind of mining-related, I would say.

1275
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:45,440
 So, can you guess what a bottom steward is?

1276
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,680
 - Bottom steward. - Bottom steward.

1277
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:52,360
 Is Dustin Hoffman played this role, actually?

1278
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:54,880
 - Someone who looks after the lifts in the mine. - Pretty close.

1279
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:58,120
 It's someone who looks after the people who work at the bottom of the pit.

1280
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:00,920
 - Oh, okay. Nice. - Back ripper.

1281
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:05,000
 - Back ripper. - No, it's someone who removes the old supports.

1282
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,320
 So when you're going away from somewhere, you get all the supports from behind you

1283
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:11,520
 and then you put them in front of you, so you're ripping them away from the back.

1284
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,520
 - Oh, okay. - That's so clever.

1285
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:15,480
 - Do you know what a glory hole is? - Yes.

1286
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:21,600
 Well, I think I thought I did.

1287
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:26,080
 Perhaps they've got time for that sort of business down the bottom of a mine, though.

1288
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,600
 Everyone's got to let us steam at the end of the day.

1289
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,200
 - No, I've no idea. - If you have that rock

1290
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:33,080
 that you could just put your finger in, then maybe no, no.

1291
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:36,440
 Is it a way of seeing from different mining tunnels to each other?

1292
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:41,760
 No, it's just what miners call an extremely impressive excavation on the surface.

1293
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,360
 They call that a glory hole.

1294
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:47,240
 Can I just quickly tell you something about glory holes?

1295
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,240
 Oh, yeah, go on.

1296
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,600
 Finally, we're on that subject, are we?

1297
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:54,560
 I remember, so when COVID first kicked off,

1298
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:59,000
 the EU had a bunch of recommendations for how to avoid getting it.

1299
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,560
 And there was, and I was on the EU legal side of the website,

1300
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:07,360
 a recommendation that you take advantage of glory holes

1301
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:10,080
 to stop yourself from contracting the disease.

1302
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,760
 Um...

1303
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,600
 Wait, that's how you have sex through, right?

1304
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,320
 - Yes, yes, yes, yes. - Yeah.

1305
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:19,560
 Yeah, yeah. And it's in the EU law.

1306
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:23,440
 It feels like there might be other diseases that you're leaving yourself open for.

1307
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:28,120
 I just saw people walking around with a dart, didn't you, with a hole in them.

1308
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:31,720
 I know that the oldest glory... We're just on glory hole facts now.

1309
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:36,920
 But the oldest glory hole in Australia is in a museum, I think, in Perth.

1310
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:41,080
 And there was a big argument about whether this should be allowed to be in a museum,

1311
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,680
 because, you know, it's a glory hole.

1312
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:47,720
 But they were saying, well, it's a really important part of the LGBTQ community

1313
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,600
 in Perth and in Western Australia.

1314
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:52,760
 I mean, how old is it? Is it like Caveman?

1315
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,760
 And is it an interactive exhibit?

1316
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:58,200
 LAUGHTER

1317
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,640
 Have you seen, Dan, have you seen those things at the seaside

1318
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:04,320
 where you put your head through and you get a photograph?

1319
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,840
 It's like that.

1320
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:10,320
 I know it's my fault we're on this, but let's go back to your raw vocabulary.

1321
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,600
 No, no, I was going to say...

1322
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:14,360
 Oh, do you know the word bougie?

1323
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:18,000
 - Oh. - It was a particular, fast-drying type of cement

1324
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,080
 that you would pump into the bottom of a mine to give you a flaw.

1325
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:22,600
 - Cool. Really? - That was known as bougie.

1326
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,360
 - Yeah. Isn't that cool? - Mining is so cool.

1327
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:28,680
 Mining is... Some mines are so deep that the lifts can't go all the way down

1328
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:33,080
 because the lift cable is so heavy that you have to stop

1329
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:35,440
 because the lift would snap under the weight of the cable.

1330
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,840
 So you have to go down to a certain level and get into a new lift

1331
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,160
 and go all the way down to the bottom.

1332
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,880
 - Wow. - The technology that they have is just crazy.

1333
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:46,600
 So that's taller, like, it goes deeper than the Burj Al Khalif, for example.

1334
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:49,000
 - Well, no, I think they have to have more than one lift as well.

1335
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,760
 - Oh, there's more than one lift there, right? - Yeah, same issue as skyscrapers.

1336
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:59,320
 - Oh, wow. Tracey Eman, the artist, married a rock a few years ago.

1337
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:03,720
 - The rock are... - No, just a rock, sadly. Sadly for her.

1338
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:06,440
 She found a rock in her garden and she said, "I'm marrying this rock."

1339
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:11,480
 She was 52. She wore her father's funeral shroud for the marriage.

1340
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:14,520
 And she said, "It's not going anywhere. It will be there waiting for me."

1341
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:17,160
 And she said, "The stone I married is beautiful and dignified.

1342
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:19,200
 "It will never let me down."

1343
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,120
 They divorced two years later.

1344
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:24,640
 - Do you know what's mad about that?

1345
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:28,240
 It's that I'm pretty sure I was reading an interview with Tracey Eman recently

1346
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:30,640
 and her mum wanted to call her "pebble."

1347
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,760
 I'm fairly certain that's right. And her mum really wanted to call her "pebble."

1348
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:37,840
 And I think the doctors at the hospital said, "We can't let you call your daughter "pebble."

1349
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:41,440
 - Because you'll be fucked up if you do. - What?

1350
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,400
 - Why would they say that? The doctors? - They said, "It's not a good name."

1351
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:49,440
 - They said, "It's not a proper name." - Well, tell that to Fred Flintstone.

1352
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:52,160
 Okay, that is it. That is all of our facts.

1353
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,760
