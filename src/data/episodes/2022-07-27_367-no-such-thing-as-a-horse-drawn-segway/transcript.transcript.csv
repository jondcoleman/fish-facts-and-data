00:00:14,00:00:20,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:00:20,00:00:25,"from four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with"
00:00:25,00:00:30,"Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin and once again we have gathered"
00:00:30,00:00:35,around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in a particular
00:00:35,00:00:42,"order here we go. Starting with you, Anna. My fact this week is that the world's first"
00:00:42,00:00:50,"electricity power station was built to power an artificial rainbow. Wow, that is cool."
00:00:50,00:00:59,"It was the 1870s, late 1870s, 1877, 78 and we're in Bavaria and it was built for this king,"
00:00:59,00:01:04,"King Ludwig II, known as the fairy tale king for reasons that will become obvious during this section."
00:01:04,00:01:09,"He used to be a frog, didn't he? He did, yeah."
00:01:09,00:01:16,And he wanted to make himself this grotto. He wanted to recreate these things called blue
00:01:16,00:01:21,grottos which are natural sea caves where the sunlight makes the water glow in all rainbow
00:01:21,00:01:27,"colors and so he decided, I've heard about this new invention, electricity and I think"
00:01:27,00:01:33,I'm going to use it and so there was a little power station set up which used a steam steam
00:01:33,00:01:39,"basically which powered a dynamo and that generated electricity. So spun some coils around magnets,"
00:01:39,00:01:44,"generated electricity, you got a full on rainbow inside his personal cave. It is cool but you"
00:01:44,00:01:48,"would think that they'd find something better to do with their electricity, wouldn't they?"
00:01:48,00:01:54,I can't think of any better use though. But it's amazing what he did install because that grotto
00:01:54,00:01:59,is full of not only the first artificial rainbow to be powered by this station but
00:01:59,00:02:04,"also the first, like I've been to those pools where they create artificial waves and you see"
00:02:04,00:02:09,people going surfing on them indoors. The prototype basically of that was built for this grotto.
00:02:09,00:02:13,"The wave pool, yeah. It was a wave pool, the world's first known wave machine."
00:02:13,00:02:18,I've spent so long trying to work out how that was powered and I can't work out if it's just
00:02:18,00:02:23,directly steam powered or whether that was part of the electricity power station fueling it.
00:02:23,00:02:29,"Wait, are you talking about the Undosa wave pool? Because this was a little bit after he died."
00:02:29,00:02:32,"Danny, you're saying it was one inside the cave. Yeah, I'm saying it was one in the grotto, yeah."
00:02:32,00:02:37,"Because, okay, this is bizarre. So he died at Lake Stranberg, which is another thing we'll come"
00:02:37,00:02:41,"on to Ludwig. He died there and then 20 years after he died, this is what I found, is that the"
00:02:41,00:02:47,"first wave machine, the Velenbad or wave bath was built on the shores of Lake Stranberg and it was"
00:02:47,00:02:52,"given the name Undosa as well, which is Latin for the wave kingdom and it was steam powered."
00:02:52,00:02:58,The steam engines lifted up these massive pontoons and that pulled up water and then you crash back
00:02:58,00:03:03,"down and that created a bigger wave. Oh my God, that sounds so cool. And that was in the, what,"
00:03:03,00:03:10,"the early, the late 19th, early 20th century and the next oldest one opened in 1912 and that is"
00:03:10,00:03:16,called the Biltsbad and it's still working today. There's a 109 year old wave machine. That's amazing
00:03:16,00:03:22,because actually the one that I used to go to in Bolton in the 90s isn't there anymore. So that
00:03:22,00:03:28,"shows, doesn't it? It shows how well this one stayed. Sick transit, yeah. They used to build"
00:03:28,00:03:32,"things to last in the olden days. They did, yeah. But did that mean on the pontoon, that's sort of"
00:03:32,00:03:36,"a double ride, right? Because if you're in the water, you can surf the waves and then if you're"
00:03:36,00:03:40,"sitting on the pontoon, you see soaring up and down that pontoon. That's great. They don't do"
00:03:40,00:03:44,that enough for rides where you're sort of half on the ride before you get onto the actual ride
00:03:44,00:03:48,itself. That feels like a missed trick. You've invented that there now. I like it. I think it's
00:03:48,00:03:52,"a bit like when you're queuing for a ride and they have stuff to keep the queue occupied,"
00:03:52,00:03:58,"don't they? Yeah, but they usually send like a drunken, dressed-up person who just harasses you"
00:03:58,00:04:03,and makes you do stuff you don't want to do in my experience. What theme parks have you been
00:04:03,00:04:10,to? I was at the Sydney Museum when I was a kid and this drunken Cleopatra came up and she started
00:04:10,00:04:16,"harassing me, yeah. It feels like we stumbled more into a kind of therapy thing now than a,"
00:04:16,00:04:20,"that's not a, you know, that's your least relatable bit of stand-up I've ever heard of."
00:04:20,00:04:24,You know when you go through the museum and Cleopatra's drunk and she's harassing you?
00:04:24,00:04:25,Did she show you her asp?
00:04:25,00:04:32,"Just on the waves that Ludwig made, I did read that they were mostly ripples."
00:04:32,00:04:37,So there's a lot of claims but I'm not sure you could surf them. I think you made a good body
00:04:37,00:04:42,board as a small toddler on his ripples if you really tried. But he was into lots of stuff if
00:04:42,00:04:50,"not surfing, wasn't he? And actually, I think the Speaking of Rides, the castle at Disneyland"
00:04:50,00:04:55,"is based on Neuschwanstein Castle, which is one of his, isn't it? Yes. I think."
00:04:55,00:05:01,"Yeah, yeah, you're right. It's amazingly similar to Disney. Well, really, you realise how much"
00:05:01,00:05:07,Disney just nicks from Prince Ludwig. It's so unfair. And that was the same one that's
00:05:07,00:05:12,"used in Shitty Chitty Bang Bang in Bulgaria, the Neuschwanstein. Yeah, they filmed there, yeah."
00:05:12,00:05:17,Someone said that it's quite tacky if close up. It's best from a distance.
00:05:17,00:05:22,"I've been there, I must say. Have you? Yeah, I think probably from the car park,"
00:05:22,00:05:28,"which is the other side of the valley. It's an amazing photograph, definitely. That's my tip."
00:05:28,00:05:32,"If you're ever in Neuschwanstein, just go to the car park and take your photos from there and"
00:05:32,00:05:36,"then go to a nice cafe over the road. So James, did you get to see, there's a few things in there"
00:05:36,00:05:40,that I found fascinating and he built them in a couple of these places. But one of the things was
00:05:40,00:05:46,he didn't want to see his servants when he was eating. And so there's this table that he built
00:05:46,00:05:50,"where the table, when it was going to be laid, would be lowered through the ground to where"
00:05:50,00:05:54,the servants were and where the kitchens were and everything would be put on and then it would come
00:05:54,00:05:59,"back up. So if he sort of like, I guess, needed salt, he would send the table back down and then"
00:05:59,00:06:03,it would come back however many minutes later. But he didn't want to see anyone. Did you see that?
00:06:03,00:06:07,"I actually got that. Oh, that's Linda Hoff. That was Linda Hoff."
00:06:07,00:06:12,"I heard it was in both, actually. I heard that he built one there as well. But maybe I'm"
00:06:12,00:06:18,misreading that. The guy was wealthy. He could commission a table. But so there was definitely
00:06:18,00:06:21,"that at Linda Hoff. And that Linda Hoff was also where he had the peacock throne,"
00:06:21,00:06:25,"which was a massive peacock. Also, there was a massive peacock statue,"
00:06:25,00:06:30,which he had placed on the lawn to clarify that he was in. So please don't bother him.
00:06:30,00:06:34,That was his way of announcing that he didn't want any attention was a big statue of a peacock.
00:06:34,00:06:40,I don't know. Maybe it would take people's attention away from him.
00:06:40,00:06:43,That's a very good point. You can only look at one at a time.
00:06:43,00:06:49,"He was very anti-social. Kind of a weird loner with a peacock obsession, I think,"
00:06:49,00:06:53,because he also had a giant peacock made of emeralds hanging from one of his ceilings.
00:06:53,00:06:58,"But his castle, I think this was Linda Hoff castle, is big and had one bedroom."
00:06:58,00:07:02,"Wow, really? You are not having guests."
00:07:02,00:07:06,"When you're browsing property websites and you see a lovely looking house,"
00:07:06,00:07:11,"and then you see one bed, you think. Yeah, but imagine if you went on to,"
00:07:11,00:07:14,"I don't know what they call, right move or something, and you put your filters in,"
00:07:14,00:07:16,"and you're just like, I just want a one bedroom house."
00:07:17,00:07:22,"And then you start by price, and then you get this thing, which is worth about 10 billion pounds."
00:07:22,00:07:25,But you've got to uncheck wave pools.
00:07:25,00:07:31,He had a favourite column at Linda Hoff.
00:07:31,00:07:32,Don't we all?
00:07:32,00:07:35,"Yeah, it was just his personal favourite column. So every time he passed it,"
00:07:35,00:07:39,he couldn't help but stop to kiss it. He just loved it.
00:07:39,00:07:43,"And he also had a bust of Marie Antoinette, and every time he walked past it,"
00:07:43,00:07:45,he would stroke her cheek and bow to her.
00:07:45,00:07:48,"So he did have a few people in the house, they just weren't real."
00:07:48,00:07:53,"Well, he also would sometimes kind of sit around talking to Louis the 16th,"
00:07:53,00:07:55,who died quite a long time before.
00:07:55,00:08:01,"Because like you say, I mean, it's quite a sad existence in a way, isn't it?"
00:08:01,00:08:07,Because he was painfully shy and possibly some mental problems there as well.
00:08:07,00:08:14,"It was really, it's kind of a sad story, but with lots of beautiful things to see about it."
00:08:15,00:08:17,With all these amazing things that he built.
00:08:17,00:08:19,"James, it's kind of like your car park thing."
00:08:19,00:08:22,"If you look at it from the right distance, it's incredibly magical and beautiful."
00:08:22,00:08:25,"And up close, actually, the reality is a little bit stranger and sadder."
00:08:25,00:08:31,"He was, I think it was Louis the 14th, he was obsessed with, but he was really into it."
00:08:31,00:08:34,He definitely was seen talking to Louis the 16th for sure.
00:08:34,00:08:35,"Oh, maybe it's all the movies."
00:08:35,00:08:39,"Was that just in the air, James? Like if he was at his empty dinner table?"
00:08:39,00:08:44,"Yeah, he would be sat at his dinner table, having a conversation with dead kings, basically."
00:08:44,00:08:47,"But I can't say it wasn't Louis the 14th, it could have been as well for sure."
00:08:47,00:08:52,"Only because he was, so he used to make his whole retinue dress up as Louis the 14th,"
00:08:52,00:08:54,sort of servants.
00:08:54,00:08:56,He would imitate Louis the 14th in absolutely everything.
00:08:56,00:08:58,He'd always dress up as him.
00:08:58,00:09:00,"He basically wanted, I think he was in love."
00:09:00,00:09:01,This is my theory.
00:09:01,00:09:04,He was very passionate in love with Louis the 14th and Wagner.
00:09:04,00:09:05,These were his two idols.
00:09:05,00:09:08,I think it's fairly certain he was gay.
00:09:08,00:09:15,"And so he imitated Louis and with Wagner, which this grotto was based on Wagner's Tannhäuser opera,"
00:09:15,00:09:20,which is like all about the Leuvenus' Grotto and how sexy it was.
00:09:20,00:09:24,"He used to write these letters to Wagner, which are the Rondche stuff."
00:09:24,00:09:28,"And put Wagner in quite a weird position, I think."
00:09:28,00:09:32,The story of Wagner and Ludwig is extraordinary.
00:09:34,00:09:38,Ludwig was basically obsessed with Wagner.
00:09:38,00:09:42,"And as soon as he became king, almost within weeks, he sent out his people to find him."
00:09:42,00:09:47,"And they had to hunt really far and wide for Wagner, because at that point,"
00:09:47,00:09:49,he was hiding from debt creditors.
00:09:49,00:09:53,"So he was in hiding and they managed to out him and go,"
00:09:53,00:09:54,"""The king wants you."""
00:09:54,00:09:55,"And he thought, ""Oh my God, I'm in trouble."""
00:09:55,00:09:58,"And they said, ""No, he basically wants to pay off your debts"
00:09:58,00:10:02,"and he wants you to live in this castle with him and he wants you to be his best friend."""
00:10:02,00:10:05,"And Wagner was like, ""Thank God, yes. Great."""
00:10:05,00:10:12,"Yeah, Wagner would play his pieces in front of Ludwig, just him, right?"
00:10:12,00:10:16,"He would be these massive, kind of amazing Wagnerian,"
00:10:16,00:10:18,"obviously Wagnerian, because it was Wagner who wrote them."
00:10:18,00:10:21,Are these amazing operas?
00:10:21,00:10:24,And but only literally just Ludwig sat on the front row.
00:10:24,00:10:26,"A bit like your Edinburgh show's dad, I reckon, probably."
00:10:26,00:10:31,"There was a bigger audience at the start, but when Dan got onto his,"
00:10:31,00:10:34,"you know, when you get on a theme park, material."
00:10:34,00:10:37,The ghost of all the King Louis loved that shit.
00:10:37,00:10:40,Oh dear.
00:10:40,00:10:46,And so Ludwig was engaged to a woman for a small amount of time.
00:10:46,00:10:48,This was his cousin Sophie Charlotte.
00:10:48,00:10:52,And but basically what happened was they got engaged
00:10:52,00:10:55,"and Ludwig just kept cancelling the wedding,"
00:10:55,00:10:58,"kept cancelling it, kept cancelling it and eventually I got pulled."
00:10:59,00:11:01,But Sophie Charlotte's really interesting.
00:11:01,00:11:03,"This is a sad story, but kind of interesting."
00:11:03,00:11:07,So she died in 1897 in a fire.
00:11:07,00:11:09,She was at a charity event.
00:11:09,00:11:13,"There was a big fire, but she insisted that all of the visitors"
00:11:13,00:11:16,and all of the girls who were performing at this thing
00:11:16,00:11:19,"and all of the nuns, they were all taken out first."
00:11:19,00:11:21,And she refused to leave until everyone else was safe.
00:11:21,00:11:23,And she ended up dying in the fire.
00:11:23,00:11:27,"But actually the interesting part about it is she was,"
00:11:27,00:11:29,her body was found because she had gold fillings
00:11:29,00:11:31,and she's possibly the first person
00:11:31,00:11:34,who was ever identified by dental remains.
00:11:34,00:11:36,"History, yeah."
00:11:36,00:11:38,What a claim to fame.
00:11:38,00:11:39,"Yeah, a sad one."
00:11:39,00:11:41,"But yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:11:41,00:11:44,I was reading about the way he broke off the engagement
00:11:44,00:11:50,"and he wrote to her and he said in his letter, breaking it off,"
00:11:50,00:11:53,the main substance of our relationship has always been
00:11:53,00:11:56,Richard Wagner's remarkable and deep new destiny.
00:11:56,00:11:58,What do you think?
00:11:58,00:11:59,"Yeah, maybe not."
00:11:59,00:12:00,He's just not that into you.
00:12:00,00:12:09,"He was deposed as from being king, right?"
00:12:09,00:12:11,Because they thought he was mad without any assessment.
00:12:11,00:12:14,"Well, there was an assessment by a few psychiatrists,"
00:12:14,00:12:16,"but because he was living in a big castle,"
00:12:16,00:12:19,they couldn't really get anyone near him.
00:12:19,00:12:21,"So they kind of assessed him from the car park,"
00:12:21,00:12:22,if you could think of it that way.
00:12:23,00:12:25,Were they just waiting for the peacock to go?
00:12:25,00:12:28,"Every day peacock's still there, nothing we can do."
00:12:28,00:12:31,But then they sent a delegation from Munich
00:12:31,00:12:34,to Neuschweinstein where he was living to declare him insane.
00:12:34,00:12:38,But Ludwig got the local fire department
00:12:38,00:12:43,to kind of form a little army in his outside his castle
00:12:43,00:12:44,to stop them from coming in.
00:12:44,00:12:48,"And sure enough, the fire brigade did the job"
00:12:48,00:12:50,and they had to go all the way back to Munich
00:12:50,00:12:53,and it was a bit later that they came with a few more heavies
00:12:53,00:12:55,and they managed to take him
00:12:55,00:12:57,"and they took him to this lake, didn't they?"
00:12:57,00:13:00,"Lake Stanberg, where he was kept."
00:13:00,00:13:02,He was kept and then he was found floating dead
00:13:02,00:13:04,in Lake Stanberg in 1886.
00:13:04,00:13:05,And I read one account which said
00:13:05,00:13:07,his doctor also was found dead floating in the lake.
00:13:07,00:13:09,And that to me is sus.
00:13:09,00:13:13,"Because water was shallow, he was a pretty decent swimmer."
00:13:13,00:13:16,"He was a surfer, we know that much."
00:13:19,00:13:22,"Yeah, and there is a secret society to this day"
00:13:22,00:13:25,which once they're called the Google Manor
00:13:25,00:13:28,and they're quite mysterious.
00:13:28,00:13:29,They wear hoods and black robes
00:13:29,00:13:33,and they keep petitioning the Prime Minister of Bavaria
00:13:33,00:13:36,to have a big bust of him carved into a mountainside.
00:13:36,00:13:40,Really? But the doctor who was found dead alongside him
00:13:40,00:13:42,apparently had been assaulted.
00:13:42,00:13:44,So there is a suggestion
00:13:44,00:13:46,and I don't want to get into any more
00:13:46,00:13:48,"scurrilous suggestions like you, Andy,"
00:13:48,00:13:49,but I'm just going to put this out there.
00:13:49,00:13:52,There's some people think that Ludwig killed himself
00:13:52,00:13:54,and that he killed the doctor as well.
00:13:54,00:13:55,Okay.
00:13:55,00:13:57,"There's a suggestion of that, I don't know."
00:13:57,00:13:59,"Or the doctor, the doctor ran after him"
00:13:59,00:14:00,was trying to save him.
00:14:00,00:14:01,I thought maybe they fought in the water
00:14:01,00:14:04,and sort of accidental drowning.
00:14:04,00:14:05,But there is this quite weird twist
00:14:05,00:14:08,which I will agree supports Andy's theory
00:14:08,00:14:11,which is that a portrait of Ludwig
00:14:11,00:14:14,"has just been quite recently uncovered, discovered."
00:14:14,00:14:16,And it was the portrait that was done
00:14:16,00:14:17,a few hours after his death
00:14:17,00:14:18,is that weird thing that they used to do.
00:14:18,00:14:20,What? Yeah.
00:14:20,00:14:23,And there's blood coming from his mouth
00:14:23,00:14:25,and the argument is that if you just drowned
00:14:25,00:14:27,then you wouldn't have blood falling through your mouth.
00:14:27,00:14:29,I've got one more theory to chuck in about his death.
00:14:29,00:14:30,"Oh yeah, great."
00:14:30,00:14:31,I think it's something that Andy hid on
00:14:31,00:14:34,which no one else probably has touched on
00:14:34,00:14:35,that's busted this case wide open.
00:14:35,00:14:38,So the story I read is that he asked the doctor
00:14:38,00:14:39,to go for a walk
00:14:39,00:14:42,and then they were later found dead by this lake.
00:14:42,00:14:44,Now could it be that Ludwig
00:14:44,00:14:46,had noticed something extraordinary at this lake?
00:14:47,00:14:48,Because only just a few...
00:14:48,00:14:51,This is such a true crime podcast.
00:14:51,00:14:53,"Well, you've gone into."
00:14:53,00:14:54,I swear the listeners are.
00:14:54,00:14:55,We've got to follow it.
00:14:55,00:15:00,Just a few short years later
00:15:00,00:15:03,what billion-dollar industry erupts
00:15:03,00:15:05,on the very shores of that lake?
00:15:05,00:15:07,The wave machine industry.
00:15:07,00:15:08,Yes.
00:15:08,00:15:11,I think billion-dollar is a big claim.
00:15:11,00:15:12,"Ludwig said to the doctor,"
00:15:12,00:15:15,"""Listen, mate, I found the spot where we can make"
00:15:15,00:15:18,"the next stage of my prototype wave machine."""
00:15:18,00:15:20,There was a third person in the party
00:15:20,00:15:21,who's not been recorded.
00:15:21,00:15:23,It's too much of a coincidence.
00:15:23,00:15:25,"Oh, you mean Jonathan Wave Machine."
00:15:25,00:15:26,Exactly.
00:15:26,00:15:28,After whom the invention was named.
00:15:28,00:15:29,It's something fishing in.
00:15:29,00:15:33,"Wow, that's a very entertaining and interesting theory."
00:15:33,00:15:37,"It's definitely worth saying, I think."
00:15:37,00:15:40,"Wow, our journey into true crime has been very smooth so far."
00:15:40,00:15:42,"Yeah, I don't think my favorite bird"
00:15:42,00:15:43,will shake themselves much.
00:15:43,00:15:54,"Okay, it is time for fact number two."
00:15:54,00:15:56,And that is my fact.
00:15:56,00:15:58,My fact this week is that some dinner knives
00:15:58,00:16:02,in the 16th century had sheet music etched onto the blade
00:16:02,00:16:04,so that guests could sing a blessing together
00:16:04,00:16:06,before and after the meal.
00:16:06,00:16:09,So this is a fact that I spotted on Twitter.
00:16:10,00:16:12,It's a guy called Filippo Lorenzin
00:16:12,00:16:14,"who tweeted about these knives,"
00:16:14,00:16:16,which I just found astonishing.
00:16:16,00:16:17,They're so beautiful.
00:16:17,00:16:17,"Wow, that's really cool."
00:16:17,00:16:19,How big were dinner knives?
00:16:19,00:16:20,I'll tell you what.
00:16:20,00:16:22,How long was this piece of music?
00:16:22,00:16:27,These were very much crocodile dandy size knives.
00:16:27,00:16:30,And there's a lot of confusion about it.
00:16:30,00:16:34,"Took them out and went, ""Call that a knife!"""
00:16:37,00:16:40,"So if we were doing what the knives had said just then,"
00:16:40,00:16:41,"and we were following James,"
00:16:41,00:16:43,James would have had his little tune there.
00:16:43,00:16:46,"But on my knife, I would have had a separate set of notes"
00:16:46,00:16:48,"that would harmonize with James,"
00:16:48,00:16:50,"as would you, Andy, and as with you, Anna."
00:16:50,00:16:52,Have a good look harmonizing with what I just did.
00:16:52,00:16:56,And so it would be a song that came out
00:16:56,00:16:57,where everyone had a different part.
00:16:57,00:17:00,So you weren't all singing the same notes.
00:17:00,00:17:02,"And so, yeah, a beautiful chorus would come out."
00:17:02,00:17:04,Beautiful chorus.
00:17:04,00:17:06,These guys are probably pissed at this stage.
00:17:06,00:17:07,No one's a professional singer.
00:17:07,00:17:09,They probably can't even read the music.
00:17:09,00:17:10,Yeah.
00:17:10,00:17:12,And so what's interesting about these as well
00:17:12,00:17:14,"is there's only 16 of these that we have,"
00:17:14,00:17:16,that we know of that exist.
00:17:16,00:17:18,And they're in different museums all over the world.
00:17:18,00:17:20,The V&A has a really nice one.
00:17:20,00:17:25,And a great video of showing how the song could sound
00:17:25,00:17:26,"because they actually have one of their curators,"
00:17:26,00:17:28,Flora Dennis.
00:17:28,00:17:30,She goes to a studio and has it sung out by proper singers.
00:17:30,00:17:32,So you can actually hear the song that's sung.
00:17:33,00:17:35,And the knives were a bit different.
00:17:35,00:17:37,"On one of them, one side, it would have the blessing"
00:17:37,00:17:39,before you started your meal.
00:17:39,00:17:40,"On the other side, it would be a thank you"
00:17:40,00:17:42,for the meal that you just ate.
00:17:42,00:17:44,But they don't know how they use these knives
00:17:44,00:17:47,because were they used as functional knives?
00:17:47,00:17:50,You didn't really cut your own meat back then.
00:17:50,00:17:51,That was something that your servants would do.
00:17:51,00:17:53,There were people who had specific jobs for that.
00:17:53,00:17:56,"And also, it's a very flat knife."
00:17:56,00:17:57,"You could cut meat in theory,"
00:17:57,00:17:59,but it looked more like it was a serving knife.
00:17:59,00:18:02,"They were made somewhere in France in the 1550s,"
00:18:02,00:18:04,but they were made for an Italian client.
00:18:04,00:18:06,We don't really know who that Italian client was.
00:18:06,00:18:09,So there's a lot of confusion and mystery around it.
00:18:09,00:18:12,But I'm sure true crime fish will get to the bottom of it
00:18:12,00:18:14,before this fact is over.
00:18:14,00:18:16,There is one theory.
00:18:16,00:18:18,This was according to art historian Mimi Hellman.
00:18:18,00:18:21,She thought that it was a way of checking whether your guests
00:18:21,00:18:24,were kind of off with musical notation.
00:18:24,00:18:27,"And so if they didn't really understand the musical notation,"
00:18:27,00:18:30,then maybe they weren't good enough to be in your society.
00:18:30,00:18:33,So it's a way of weeding out the nouveau riche.
00:18:33,00:18:37,But they've already been invited to dinner at that stage.
00:18:37,00:18:40,It's quite late to be weeding them out.
00:18:40,00:18:44,"Yeah, but you've got the Smiths have just moved in down the street"
00:18:44,00:18:46,"and you're like, ""Oh, let's have them over to dinner"
00:18:46,00:18:48,"and let's see if they can hold a tune."""
00:18:48,00:18:49,"Yeah, I like that."
00:18:49,00:18:51,"That's really, wow."
00:18:51,00:18:52,We think it's a struggle remembering
00:18:52,00:18:55,that you have to start from the outside and work your way in.
00:18:55,00:18:58,"But knowing musical notation,"
00:18:58,00:19:00,and then being able to strike the right pitch.
00:19:00,00:19:02,"And laying the table difficult,"
00:19:02,00:19:05,"because if you miss one knife out, if you've lost a knife,"
00:19:05,00:19:07,"or surely you need exactly the right number of guests,"
00:19:07,00:19:09,otherwise you're missing a crucial part of the melody.
00:19:09,00:19:10,That's true.
00:19:10,00:19:12,They used to be quite beautiful knives as well as musical.
00:19:12,00:19:14,So your personal knives would have really nice
00:19:14,00:19:17,ornate decorations if you had a bit of money.
00:19:17,00:19:19,"You'd have pictures of babies on them quite often, apparently."
00:19:19,00:19:22,As in your own children or random babies?
00:19:22,00:19:24,"I think random babies may be cherubs,"
00:19:25,00:19:28,"winged babies, flowers, peasants, feathers, darts."
00:19:28,00:19:33,"Oh, what a beautiful peasant."
00:19:33,00:19:37,A bucolic rustic scene.
00:19:37,00:19:41,You want to drop a peasant in there next to a haystack or something.
00:19:41,00:19:42,"Again, these must have been huge knives."
00:19:42,00:19:44,"This is according to B Wilson,"
00:19:44,00:19:48,obviously the sort of queen of crockery history.
00:19:48,00:19:49,So good.
00:19:49,00:19:52,"And she said, ""You would no more use someone else's knife"
00:19:52,00:19:53,"than you'd use someone else's toothbrush."""
00:19:54,00:19:55,"Oh, really?"
00:19:55,00:19:57,That's how I attach people work.
00:19:57,00:20:00,"Shall we quickly name check B Wilson's book,"
00:20:00,00:20:02,"""Consider the Falk,"" which is one of the great"
00:20:02,00:20:04,non-fiction books over the last few years.
00:20:04,00:20:07,And also features knives.
00:20:07,00:20:08,Very misleading title.
00:20:08,00:20:11,It's so good.
00:20:11,00:20:12,It's such a good book.
00:20:12,00:20:18,"Hey, do you know in France, pointy knives were made illegal"
00:20:18,00:20:20,during the 1600s.
00:20:20,00:20:23,Do you know by who?
00:20:24,00:20:25,"Oh, in what year?"
00:20:25,00:20:28,"1669, I believe."
00:20:28,00:20:29,In France.
00:20:29,00:20:31,I say Louis the 14th.
00:20:31,00:20:33,"It's old mate, Louis the 14th."
00:20:33,00:20:34,"Yes, he's back."
00:20:34,00:20:35,Back.
00:20:35,00:20:38,"Yeah, no, because there was this whole thing"
00:20:38,00:20:41,where there was a very influential cardinal
00:20:41,00:20:43,who has a very impressive surname
00:20:43,00:20:46,that I've tried pronouncing about 12 times before this started.
00:20:46,00:20:47,You guys all know him.
00:20:47,00:20:48,Richelor?
00:20:48,00:20:48,Richelor.
00:20:48,00:20:49,Richelor.
00:20:49,00:20:50,Richelor.
00:20:50,00:20:51,Cardinal Richelor.
00:20:52,00:20:54,"He was, you know what James was saying earlier"
00:20:54,00:20:58,about separating the nouveau riche from coming in
00:20:58,00:20:59,if they were trying to pretend
00:20:59,00:21:02,that they had singing or notation abilities.
00:21:02,00:21:05,He had that with people bringing their own knives
00:21:05,00:21:07,and they would come in and he noticed
00:21:07,00:21:10,at one of the dinner tables that there was a guy
00:21:10,00:21:12,who was sort of being really uncouth
00:21:12,00:21:13,and picking his teeth with a knife
00:21:13,00:21:14,"and he was like, you're not a rich guy."
00:21:14,00:21:16,You're just faking being a rich guy.
00:21:16,00:21:17,I can tell by your manners.
00:21:17,00:21:21,And so he banned all of the pointy knives
00:21:21,00:21:22,coming to the dinner table
00:21:22,00:21:23,and that's sort of where we started
00:21:23,00:21:26,getting the much more rounded knife at the dinner table.
00:21:26,00:21:27,Butter knife.
00:21:27,00:21:28,"Yeah, the butter knife."
00:21:28,00:21:31,"Dan, did he call this guy nouveau Richelor?"
00:21:31,00:21:33,"If not, why not?"
00:21:33,00:21:35,"Well, because I can't pronounce A the name."
00:21:35,00:21:38,I almost just got away with nouveau Riche.
00:21:38,00:21:39,I didn't quite pronounce that properly.
00:21:39,00:21:42,It's the idea of even sandwiching those two together.
00:21:42,00:21:43,"He's a, I've lost sleep over."
00:21:43,00:21:45,"Wow, that's interesting"
00:21:45,00:21:46,because you would have assumed
00:21:46,00:21:50,"it was to stop the stabby, stabby dinner party thing, wouldn't you?"
00:21:50,00:21:50,Yeah.
00:21:50,00:21:52,But it's just bad manners.
00:21:52,00:21:54,"I think it was a, it was a politician, wasn't it?"
00:21:54,00:21:57,"It was Chancellor Seguier, apparently, who came round."
00:21:57,00:21:59,"Dad, why did you not tell us it was him?"
00:21:59,00:22:07,There's no one I can name in this entire anecdote.
00:22:07,00:22:09,"Annoyingly, except for Louie."
00:22:09,00:22:13,"Yeah, but it wasn't, it was an interesting Seguier"
00:22:13,00:22:15,from the previous Louie the 14.
00:22:15,00:22:16,"Oh, Jesus."
00:22:19,00:22:22,So that would be so great if that was where he got his name.
00:22:22,00:22:24,He just always facilitated the change in conversation.
00:22:24,00:22:28,He always used to come to dinner parties
00:22:28,00:22:32,"on one of those scooters, which you can't fall off."
00:22:32,00:22:34,"They were horse drawn back then, of course."
00:22:34,00:22:38,"Horse drawn Seguier, that would be amazing."
00:22:38,00:22:43,Are you familiar with the stupenda splendiferous butter upknife?
00:22:43,00:22:44,Yep.
00:22:44,00:22:47,It sounds fictional.
00:22:47,00:22:50,"Yeah, it sounds like it was made by Roald Dahl, doesn't it?"
00:22:50,00:22:52,That's his long name.
00:22:52,00:22:53,"I think it goes by the shorthand, the butter upknife."
00:22:53,00:22:55,I'm so excited about this knife.
00:22:55,00:22:56,I'm actually going to order one.
00:22:56,00:23:01,It's a knife that was invented by a Kickstarter in 2014.
00:23:01,00:23:05,"It raised 360,000 Australian dollars in Australia,"
00:23:05,00:23:08,"15,200 backers, for obvious reasons."
00:23:08,00:23:12,What it has is it has like tiny little cheese grater type holes
00:23:12,00:23:13,on one side.
00:23:13,00:23:14,"So when you run it along the butter,"
00:23:14,00:23:17,it splits the butter into little ribbons
00:23:17,00:23:19,"and that means that if your butter's hard,"
00:23:19,00:23:21,it immediately softens it because of the surface area
00:23:21,00:23:22,and then you can spread it nicely.
00:23:22,00:23:23,"Okay, right."
00:23:23,00:23:28,So it ends your trauma with breaking your bread into pieces
00:23:28,00:23:31,that you always have in winter when your butter's too solid to spread.
00:23:31,00:23:33,I had a look into my favourite knife.
00:23:33,00:23:35,I realised I knew nothing about it.
00:23:35,00:23:38,And it's a knife that I grew up watching on TV.
00:23:38,00:23:41,"It's the Ginsu 2000, the classic Ginsu knife."
00:23:41,00:23:42,"You guys know Ginsu, right?"
00:23:42,00:23:44,I've never heard of that.
00:23:44,00:23:45,Maybe it wasn't as big here.
00:23:45,00:23:47,There were lots of infomercials.
00:23:47,00:23:50,It's quite a famous knife in America.
00:23:50,00:23:52,"So I guess in Hong Kong, we just must have had it."
00:23:52,00:23:54,"It was one of those ones where in adverts,"
00:23:54,00:23:55,they would show it cutting through a shoe
00:23:55,00:23:57,and they would show it cutting through anything.
00:23:57,00:23:58,This is the ultimate knife.
00:23:58,00:24:00,Throw away the rest of your line.
00:24:00,00:24:02,"This is all so random, Dan."
00:24:02,00:24:02,"Ginsu, no."
00:24:02,00:24:05,When do you ever need to cut through a shoe?
00:24:05,00:24:06,"No one ever goes to a shoe shop and thinks,"
00:24:06,00:24:08,"""Oh, this is a bit big. I'll cut the end of it."""
00:24:08,00:24:12,"You need to throw away your shoes, James,"
00:24:12,00:24:14,but your kitchen bin is so tiny.
00:24:14,00:24:18,You have to take it apart.
00:24:18,00:24:21,"So is it an amazing, like a Japanese state knife kind of thing?"
00:24:21,00:24:23,"Well, so this is what I thought."
00:24:23,00:24:27,I thought Japanese technology has sort of samurai elements
00:24:27,00:24:29,to the advertising that they did.
00:24:29,00:24:31,Turns out that it was made in Ohio
00:24:31,00:24:36,and it was named by these copywriters called Barry Betcher
00:24:36,00:24:39,and Ed Valenti and a guy called Arthur Schiff.
00:24:39,00:24:40,"And the idea was they were like,"
00:24:40,00:24:43,"""No one's going to buy it under its current name,"""
00:24:43,00:24:44,which was Quick Cut.
00:24:44,00:24:46,"And they thought, ""Okay, let's give it a Japanese name."
00:24:46,00:24:47,"Let's call it Ginsu."""
00:24:47,00:24:51,And they turned it into a massive product.
00:24:51,00:24:54,"Immediately in America, it sold millions and millions."
00:24:54,00:24:58,And it was one of those infomercials that coined the phrases.
00:24:58,00:24:59,"So it's the originator of,"
00:24:59,00:25:03,"""But wait, there's more,"" that phrase that we all know."
00:25:03,00:25:04,Wow.
00:25:04,00:25:05,Brian Butterfield uses it a lot.
00:25:05,00:25:09,"That is from that advert, as well as Cool Now."
00:25:09,00:25:11,Operators are on standby.
00:25:11,00:25:14,Those were two lines that originated in these adverts.
00:25:14,00:25:16,"So the Ginsu was massive, but it's not Japanese at all."
00:25:16,00:25:18,And it's not even a Japanese word.
00:25:18,00:25:20,"When the guy was asked, ""What does it mean?"""
00:25:20,00:25:22,"he says, it roughly translates as,"
00:25:22,00:25:26,"""I never have to work again,"" because it was so successful."
00:25:26,00:25:26,Yeah.
00:25:26,00:25:27,Yeah.
00:25:27,00:25:30,"To be honest, I think no one in the UK has heard of that."
00:25:30,00:25:32,So just when you've done your...
00:25:32,00:25:33,You know what it's like when you're attacked
00:25:33,00:25:35,by a drunk Cleopatra.
00:25:35,00:25:38,How have you not heard of Ginsu?
00:25:38,00:25:40,"Some of our listeners, I'm sure, Dan,"
00:25:40,00:25:42,you've just absolutely blown their minds.
00:25:42,00:25:44,"But no, I've never heard of the Ginsu."
00:25:44,00:25:48,I was just trying to see if it was as popular as I said it was.
00:25:48,00:25:50,But I found another interesting fact just to lob in.
00:25:50,00:25:51,So I was saying it cuts through shoes.
00:25:51,00:25:55,"It also is useful for cutting off penises,"
00:25:55,00:25:58,because Lorena Bobbit used a Ginsu knife
00:25:58,00:26:01,on John Wayne Bobbit's penis when she lobbed it off
00:26:01,00:26:03,while he was sleeping in 1993.
00:26:03,00:26:05,Did that feature in the adverts as well?
00:26:05,00:26:06,I'm sure they tried to.
00:26:06,00:26:08,"But wait, there's more."
00:26:08,00:26:09,You could cut penises with it.
00:26:09,00:26:14,"Dan, what a... Just nothing to just lob in there."
00:26:14,00:26:16,A Ginsu.
00:26:16,00:26:17,They're world famous.
00:26:17,00:26:18,"Like, I can't believe they're not famous here."
00:26:18,00:26:21,I am actually shocked they're not famous here.
00:26:21,00:26:23,"I mean, it's possible that the three of us"
00:26:23,00:26:25,have just lived a sheltered life and never heard of a Ginsu.
00:26:25,00:26:27,Yeah.
00:26:27,00:26:28,One of the odds.
00:26:28,00:26:30,I think this is a dead thing.
00:26:30,00:26:32,It's not. Ginsu is massive.
00:26:32,00:26:36,Just one more thing on someone who loves knives.
00:26:36,00:26:37,A guy called John Cummings.
00:26:37,00:26:40,And he features in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine.
00:26:40,00:26:42,"And he proved, if you need it proving,"
00:26:42,00:26:44,that you should not swallow knives.
00:26:44,00:26:46,"And he did this because he was a sailor,"
00:26:46,00:26:48,and it's like late 18th century.
00:26:48,00:26:51,And he'd seen a mountabank do the fake knife swallowing trick.
00:26:51,00:26:53,"And he said to all his sailor mates,"
00:26:53,00:26:54,"""Mate, I can do that for real."""
00:26:54,00:26:55,And so he did.
00:26:55,00:26:57,So he swallowed on the first attempt.
00:26:57,00:27:00,He swallowed 19 or 20 knives.
00:27:00,00:27:03,And he did have excessive pain in his stomach and intestines.
00:27:03,00:27:04,He got some medical help.
00:27:04,00:27:06,He threw up a lot.
00:27:06,00:27:07,He pooed out quite a few of them.
00:27:07,00:27:13,Yep. Knives were coming up and going down all over the shop.
00:27:13,00:27:15,"So I guess I was so impressed with him then,"
00:27:15,00:27:17,that he tried it a few more times.
00:27:17,00:27:20,"And every time he got drunk, apparently, on board,"
00:27:20,00:27:22,"he'd say, ""There was this time I swallowed all these knives."
00:27:22,00:27:24,"If you don't believe me, I'll do it again."""
00:27:24,00:27:28,And I think he ate about 40 different knives.
00:27:28,00:27:30,And one clasp knife case as well.
00:27:30,00:27:34,And he found it very unpleasant.
00:27:34,00:27:35,He was in a lot of pain.
00:27:35,00:27:37,"He, again, vomited and pooed quite a few of them,"
00:27:37,00:27:40,but not enough to save him.
00:27:40,00:27:42,And he visited a London surgeon.
00:27:42,00:27:45,"So when he landed, sure, he was a London surgeon."
00:27:45,00:27:46,And the surgeon just didn't believe him.
00:27:46,00:27:49,"He said, ""Look, I think I've swallowed about three dozen knives."
00:27:49,00:27:51,"Can you perform surgery?"""
00:27:51,00:27:53,"And they said, ""Don't be stupid. No one would do that."""
00:27:53,00:27:56,"And a case, he'd swallowed a clasp knife case as well."
00:27:56,00:27:58,What is the point of swallowing a knife case
00:27:58,00:28:00,once you've already swallowed three dozen knives?
00:28:00,00:28:02,No one's going to be extra impressed by that bit.
00:28:02,00:28:05,"If he could somehow jiggle around his insides,"
00:28:05,00:28:07,he might be able to get the knives into the case.
00:28:07,00:28:11,"Yes, maybe that was part of the trick he hadn't honed yet."
00:28:11,00:28:13,It was the spider he was swallowing to catch the fly
00:28:13,00:28:15,of the 36 knives he'd already swallowed.
00:28:15,00:28:20,"Sadly, much like the old woman who swallowed the fly,"
00:28:20,00:28:21,"he died, of course."
00:28:21,00:28:22,"And then they did open him up,"
00:28:22,00:28:26,and they did find that he had about 30 to 40 fragments
00:28:26,00:28:28,"of wood, metal, and horn inside him."
00:28:28,00:28:30,So he was telling the truth.
00:28:30,00:28:31,Wow.
00:28:31,00:28:32,"So don't swallow knives, kids."
00:28:32,00:28:36,"Just on party tricks with knives,"
00:28:36,00:28:38,"I discovered that there's a knife-throwing hall of fame,"
00:28:38,00:28:43,and it's a sort of group in America that it's all the people
00:28:43,00:28:46,that you see when they stand someone against a wooden door
00:28:46,00:28:48,and just chuck the knives at them.
00:28:48,00:28:49,It's for that.
00:28:49,00:28:52,So the list of people who are on the sort of greatest
00:28:52,00:28:56,"current knife-throwers, there's a guy called Ted Eisenberg,"
00:28:56,00:29:00,who's ranked 18th in the world at the moment for knife-throwing.
00:29:01,00:29:03,He also holds a Guinness World Record for the most
00:29:03,00:29:06,breast augmentation surgeries ever to be performed by a male.
00:29:06,00:29:11,He doesn't do it by throwing the knife at the patient.
00:29:11,00:29:14,"If he's not combined the two, then he's missed a trick."
00:29:14,00:29:15,He definitely should do that.
00:29:15,00:29:19,"There's Lorraine and Bobbitt, who does penis reduction surgery."
00:29:19,00:29:23,With a ginsu or whatever it was.
00:29:23,00:29:24,"Ginsu, yes."
00:29:24,00:29:25,"Yes, see, you do know it."
00:29:25,00:29:28,There's the great throwdini.
00:29:28,00:29:31,"The world's fastest and most accurate knife-thrower, he calls himself."
00:29:31,00:29:34,"And then there's Jack Dagger, the king of fling."
00:29:34,00:29:41,Jack Dagger supposedly has invented the first new knife-throwing stunt
00:29:41,00:29:43,in almost a hundred years.
00:29:43,00:29:43,How?
00:29:43,00:29:46,And it's called the cucumber slice.
00:29:46,00:29:48,So he gets his assistant to stand up against the door
00:29:48,00:29:53,and she puts her arm up horizontal and rests on it a full cucumber.
00:29:53,00:29:56,And he throws a couple of knives.
00:29:56,00:29:59,"And then in this video, the third knife, he throws it"
00:29:59,00:30:04,and he slices the cucumber in half that is resting on her arm.
00:30:04,00:30:04,That's the trick.
00:30:04,00:30:08,That's the first new innovation in lengthways horizontal.
00:30:08,00:30:09,"Yeah, that's incredible."
00:30:09,00:30:10,Yeah.
00:30:10,00:30:14,"So Jack Dagger, king of fling has, yeah, the first in a hundred years."
00:30:14,00:30:17,"And of course, he keeps a jug of pimps just beneath that cucumber."
00:30:25,00:30:29,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy."
00:30:29,00:30:32,My fact is that almost all drug names in America have been approved
00:30:32,00:30:34,by just two women in Chicago.
00:30:34,00:30:37,Amazing.
00:30:37,00:30:40,They're called Stephanie and Gail.
00:30:40,00:30:45,And they are official.
00:30:45,00:30:45,They do.
00:30:45,00:30:47,They're Stephanie Schubert and Gail Carrot.
00:30:47,00:30:49,But I just thought it sounded more mysterious
00:30:49,00:30:50,if I just gave the first names.
00:30:50,00:30:51,But they have their names.
00:30:51,00:30:55,Schubert and Carrot were the sounded way more mysterious than Schubert and Carrot.
00:30:55,00:30:56,Let's get some true crime going.
00:30:56,00:30:57,One of them is a musician.
00:30:57,00:30:58,One of them is a vegetable.
00:30:58,00:31:02,Together they solve crimes.
00:31:02,00:31:03,Schubert and Carrot.
00:31:03,00:31:07,Incredibly unlikely friendship.
00:31:07,00:31:13,So the reason that they have the responsibility
00:31:13,00:31:15,for approving so many drug names
00:31:15,00:31:18,is that they work for the United States adopted names program.
00:31:18,00:31:22,"So basically, there's a tiny bit of explaining to do here,"
00:31:22,00:31:25,which is that each drug made has three names.
00:31:25,00:31:26,"It's got the chemical name,"
00:31:26,00:31:28,which is unbelievably complicated and long.
00:31:28,00:31:32,"It's got the generic name, which is, you know..."
00:31:32,00:31:34,Like what scientists would call it or something.
00:31:34,00:31:35,Exactly.
00:31:35,00:31:35,Yeah.
00:31:35,00:31:36,"And then there's branded name,"
00:31:36,00:31:38,which is what the pharmaceutical company that makes it.
00:31:38,00:31:41,"You know, that's your anusol or whatever."
00:31:41,00:31:42,That's a brand name.
00:31:42,00:31:43,I believe it's pronounced anusol.
00:31:43,00:31:45,"Yeah, is it heck?"
00:31:45,00:31:48,It's so clearly anusol.
00:31:48,00:31:50,The company says it's pronounced anusol.
00:31:50,00:31:51,It's such bullshit.
00:31:51,00:31:52,Does it actually?
00:31:52,00:31:53,"Yes, they do."
00:31:53,00:31:55,They do adverts where it's anusol.
00:31:55,00:31:56,"And like, guys, lean in."
00:31:56,00:31:59,Is this the work of Schubert and Carrot?
00:31:59,00:32:03,I didn't mean to start talking about anusol this early.
00:32:03,00:32:05,"If anyone wants to know what anusol is,"
00:32:05,00:32:08,then it's worth looking into if you've just swallowed 35 knives.
00:32:08,00:32:14,"Oh, you're going to need the big tube, I think."
00:32:14,00:32:17,Okay.
00:32:17,00:32:20,"So basically, sorry, it's completely distracted already."
00:32:20,00:32:24,"So drug makers, you know, they give the drug a chemical name,"
00:32:24,00:32:25,but you need a single generic name.
00:32:25,00:32:27,And that then goes to the World Health Organization.
00:32:27,00:32:28,"So it has to be cleared,"
00:32:28,00:32:31,because the generic names are usually global these days.
00:32:31,00:32:33,It has the same generic name throughout the world to avoid confusion.
00:32:33,00:32:38,"And when a drug firm has a new drug they want to give a generic name to,"
00:32:38,00:32:42,"they write in to the USAN, which is pretty much just Stephanie and Gail."
00:32:42,00:32:46,"Sorry, Schubert and Carrot, please."
00:32:46,00:32:47,"Sorry, sorry, sorry."
00:32:47,00:32:51,"And they either approve the names if they're okay,"
00:32:51,00:32:53,"but if it's too similar to an existing name,"
00:32:53,00:32:56,"or it's inappropriate in some language maybe,"
00:32:56,00:32:57,"or if it's linguistically unfair,"
00:32:57,00:32:59,they're the ones who come up with the new generic name
00:32:59,00:33:01,"and write back to the firm saying, hey."
00:33:01,00:33:02,"So they're like, sorry, we've got one of those."
00:33:02,00:33:04,Have you thought of butthole soul?
00:33:04,00:33:07,Yes.
00:33:07,00:33:10,"I think they wouldn't call it butthole soul,"
00:33:10,00:33:12,because that would be the brand name.
00:33:12,00:33:17,"It would be like, you know, butchersol."
00:33:17,00:33:19,"Well, so generic names are not allowed to refer to."
00:33:19,00:33:21,They've got whole careers devoted to this.
00:33:21,00:33:24,"You can't on the spot, just to be honest, okay?"
00:33:24,00:33:25,These guys are experts.
00:33:25,00:33:27,"I've realised that now, you know."
00:33:27,00:33:31,I think I was at a cocky attempt of you to make.
00:33:31,00:33:34,"It's classic, classic mansplaining, isn't it?"
00:33:34,00:33:36,"Like, oh, I could do this job easily."
00:33:36,00:33:38,"And then as soon as I try, no way."
00:33:38,00:33:40,It's very hard.
00:33:40,00:33:43,"Because, and just to say, neither anusol nor butthole soul,"
00:33:43,00:33:47,"great name, would be accepted because the generic name can't refer to a body part."
00:33:47,00:33:51,"That's one of the guidelines that they say, because it's a generic thing."
00:33:51,00:33:53,"So, yeah, anyway."
00:33:53,00:33:57,"So yeah, and I actually wrote to Stephanie Schubat as part of this,"
00:33:57,00:34:01,"just to check the process works and she wrote back saying, yes, that's the process."
00:34:01,00:34:06,"We didn't get the snappy ban to go, but that's because she's a professional."
00:34:06,00:34:07,She's got a lot of drugs today.
00:34:07,00:34:10,"You're the next Michael Parkinson, Andy."
00:34:10,00:34:13,I don't know how you get this stuff out of people.
00:34:14,00:34:18,"So, with the, say, like the current COVID vaccines, I guess that would be a process"
00:34:18,00:34:22,"where they had to just fling it to the front and just go, we just need a name, right?"
00:34:22,00:34:24,We don't have time for all this stuff.
00:34:24,00:34:26,"Well, that's brand names, right?"
00:34:26,00:34:29,"So generic names of drugs are the names that when a patient expires,"
00:34:29,00:34:32,"then you just get the generic version, like ibuprofen or whatever."
00:34:32,00:34:36,"But at the moment, these are all, that's why they've all got lots of different names,"
00:34:36,00:34:37,these COVID vaccines.
00:34:37,00:34:39,"Well, some of them don't, though."
00:34:39,00:34:40,That's the bizarre thing.
00:34:40,00:34:45,"The Pfizer jab, which gets referred to by literally 100% of people as the Pfizer jab,"
00:34:45,00:34:48,is technically called Corminati.
00:34:48,00:34:50,Do you have to do it in a West Country accent?
00:34:50,00:34:52,Corminati.
00:34:52,00:34:59,"It's a mix of community, immunity, mRNA and COVID."
00:34:59,00:35:00,And it gets called Corminati.
00:35:00,00:35:06,"But the AstraZeneca one, it has a brand name in India, which is Covershield."
00:35:06,00:35:09,"And everywhere else in the world, it just gets called the AstraZeneca jab."
00:35:10,00:35:11,Really?
00:35:11,00:35:11,Yeah.
00:35:11,00:35:14,The thing is that there are lots of different people who can name it.
00:35:14,00:35:16,So there's the British approved names.
00:35:16,00:35:21,"So if there's any drug that's done in Britain, our version of Carrot and Shuba"
00:35:21,00:35:23,is the British approved names group.
00:35:23,00:35:27,"In France, they have the Domination Commune Française."
00:35:27,00:35:30,"In Japanese, they have Japanese adopted names."
00:35:30,00:35:34,"And all these people then feed it into the World Health Organization,"
00:35:34,00:35:35,who then make the final decisions.
00:35:36,00:35:40,"But in the '90s, there was a problem because loads of names were different"
00:35:40,00:35:44,all around the world before the WHO kind of got in on this.
00:35:44,00:35:48,And there was a letter in the BMJ that gave 100 common drugs
00:35:48,00:35:51,where the names was completely different in the UK than what it was in America.
00:35:51,00:35:53,Just completely different.
00:35:53,00:35:56,"And if you look at some of the older things like Paracetamol,"
00:35:56,00:35:58,"in English, it's Paracetamol."
00:35:58,00:36:00,"In French, it's Paracetamol."
00:36:00,00:36:02,"In Spanish, it's Paracetamol."
00:36:02,00:36:05,"In Russian, it's Paracetamol."
00:36:05,00:36:09,"And in the US, it's Acetaminophen."
00:36:09,00:36:11,"It's just completely different, isn't it?"
00:36:11,00:36:13,"I mean, that's just a..."
00:36:13,00:36:15,"I've always got to be different, haven't I?"
00:36:15,00:36:16,Yeah.
00:36:16,00:36:19,"See, that would be a name that Americans would be like,"
00:36:19,00:36:21,"""Yeah, that's our name for it, right?"""
00:36:21,00:36:22,It's like ginsu.
00:36:22,00:36:23,"See, this is what I'm trying to say."
00:36:23,00:36:29,You can have world-famous things that we're just oblivious to.
00:36:29,00:36:30,And that's a good example.
00:36:30,00:36:31,"Half a second before he said it,"
00:36:31,00:36:33,I thought he's going to bring us back to the bloody knife.
00:36:34,00:36:37,"Interestingly, if you do get your penis chopped off,"
00:36:37,00:36:40,then Paracetamol is probably going to help a little bit.
00:36:40,00:36:43,"Again, do swallow Paracetamol."
00:36:43,00:36:44,Don't swallow knives.
00:36:44,00:36:45,Can't emphasize that enough.
00:36:45,00:36:50,"But this is why Shubert and Carrot are so crucial, I guess,"
00:36:50,00:36:53,is that America produces so many of the generic drugs
00:36:53,00:36:55,that need to be spread around the world.
00:36:55,00:36:56,"And then it must be so difficult,"
00:36:56,00:36:58,because they have to make sure that they're not confusing
00:36:58,00:37:00,"in any language, right?"
00:37:00,00:37:04,So they can't have offensive names in any language.
00:37:04,00:37:06,"Although the only one that I could find,"
00:37:06,00:37:08,the only example they gave of one they rejected
00:37:08,00:37:11,"because it was rude, was a prefix to a drug name"
00:37:11,00:37:14,"that was suggested as privy, P-R-I-V-I,"
00:37:14,00:37:16,"which one of them said, ""Sounds like an outhouse."""
00:37:16,00:37:22,"Which I thought is quite a weird and prudish name to give for a toilet, but..."
00:37:22,00:37:23,"Plastic Shubert, though, you know."
00:37:23,00:37:26,She's prim.
00:37:26,00:37:28,"Carrot's the party girl, isn't she?"
00:37:28,00:37:33,And one problem with naming of medical stuff
00:37:33,00:37:38,"is that sometimes they have things that have funny names in medicine,"
00:37:38,00:37:39,so especially in genes.
00:37:39,00:37:41,Have you guys ever looked at lists of gene names?
00:37:41,00:37:44,They are amazing.
00:37:44,00:37:46,This is where doctors really come into their own.
00:37:46,00:37:48,"So Tin Man, for instance, is one gene,"
00:37:48,00:37:51,and that's a gene that's required for proper development of the heart.
00:37:51,00:37:55,"The Spock, the Spock one gene."
00:37:55,00:37:57,"And if that is mutated, then..."
00:37:57,00:37:58,Is that your ears?
00:37:58,00:37:59,Very good.
00:37:59,00:38:01,"Oh, give us some of those quizzes."
00:38:01,00:38:02,"Oh, yeah, okay, okay."
00:38:02,00:38:03,Here we go.
00:38:03,00:38:05,"So in zebrafish, it gives them pointy ears."
00:38:05,00:38:07,"Cheap date, gene."
00:38:07,00:38:10,Never orders a dessert.
00:38:10,00:38:14,Makes you get drunk of one glass of alcohol.
00:38:14,00:38:15,It metabolises it in a weird...
00:38:15,00:38:16,"Absolutely, bang on."
00:38:16,00:38:18,Mutation spills susceptibility to alcohol.
00:38:18,00:38:23,"Okay, I will give you the Ken and Barbie genes."
00:38:23,00:38:24,Two different genes.
00:38:24,00:38:27,They remove the genitals.
00:38:27,00:38:28,Very good.
00:38:28,00:38:30,That should be the Lorena gene.
00:38:32,00:38:34,Is that what it is?
00:38:34,00:38:37,That's mutations on those genes mean that you lack external genitals.
00:38:37,00:38:39,"Again, it's mostly studied in zebrafish."
00:38:39,00:38:40,Right.
00:38:40,00:38:44,"But then if you get ill, then it can be quite serious."
00:38:44,00:38:46,And then you've got this quite funny name.
00:38:46,00:38:50,"So, for instance, I think there was a disease called catch-22."
00:38:50,00:38:53,"And it was a very clever acronym,"
00:38:53,00:38:56,"which did the cardiac anomaly T-cell deficit,"
00:38:56,00:39:00,clefting and hypochalcemia for chromosome 22.
00:39:00,00:39:01,Very good.
00:39:01,00:39:03,It's something quite serious when you've got it.
00:39:03,00:39:06,And the name catch-22 sounds like it's a no-win situation.
00:39:06,00:39:09,That's one of those things where enough people are diagnosed.
00:39:09,00:39:10,"They said, ""I don't really want a disease"
00:39:10,00:39:12,"that's called the catch-22 disease."""
00:39:12,00:39:13,"What? It's like, did you catch one disease?"
00:39:13,00:39:15,Catch one disease?
00:39:15,00:39:16,I caught 22.
00:39:16,00:39:22,"You know, the same bloke invented heroin and aspirin"
00:39:22,00:39:23,within the same two weeks.
00:39:23,00:39:24,Really?
00:39:24,00:39:25,Yeah.
00:39:25,00:39:28,You know Felix Hoffman working at Bayer?
00:39:28,00:39:28,"Oh, Hoffman."
00:39:28,00:39:30,Are they related to each other?
00:39:30,00:39:33,"Like, is it almost like you just add salt to one?"
00:39:33,00:39:36,Or is it completely different medicines?
00:39:36,00:39:37,"He was adding, yeah, kind of."
00:39:37,00:39:39,He was adding acetyl.
00:39:39,00:39:41,He was acetylizing various different molecules.
00:39:41,00:39:45,"Now, both had kind of been created."
00:39:45,00:39:47,"Those chemicals have been created previously,"
00:39:47,00:39:49,but they hadn't been commercialized or made in a stable form.
00:39:49,00:39:54,Was Hoffman the one who took loads of heroin and then cycled home?
00:39:54,00:39:54,Or...
00:39:54,00:39:57,I thought that was the LSD guy.
00:39:57,00:39:58,Timothy Leary.
00:39:58,00:39:59,Maybe it was.
00:39:59,00:40:00,"No, I think you're right."
00:40:00,00:40:01,I think it's Hoffman.
00:40:01,00:40:02,"Yeah, I think it's Hoffman."
00:40:02,00:40:03,I thought he'd take an LSD and cycled home.
00:40:03,00:40:05,"Maybe, I can't really remember."
00:40:05,00:40:06,Yeah.
00:40:06,00:40:10,"But I mean, the thing is, we sort of think it's funny now"
00:40:10,00:40:15,that heroin was marketed as a cough medicine by Bayer.
00:40:15,00:40:18,But actually tuberculosis and pneumonia
00:40:18,00:40:20,were such massive causes of death
00:40:20,00:40:23,that it was very useful to have a cough remedy.
00:40:23,00:40:25,"Like, it was a really desperate need."
00:40:25,00:40:27,"And within a year, you could get heroin pastels,"
00:40:27,00:40:27,which I didn't know.
00:40:29,00:40:29,Would they flavor them?
00:40:29,00:40:33,"You know, it tastes nice if you had a raspberry flavor to it."
00:40:33,00:40:33,I don't know.
00:40:33,00:40:34,I don't know if they'll flavor them.
00:40:34,00:40:35,That's a good way.
00:40:35,00:40:38,"You could play Russian roulette with fruit pastels, couldn't you?"
00:40:38,00:40:41,"Well, one of them has got heroin."
00:40:41,00:40:42,Yes.
00:40:42,00:40:45,"Wow, that is the progression of the game Gin or Water,"
00:40:45,00:40:46,which is one of my favorite games.
00:40:46,00:40:49,I think heroin with pastels is the next stage.
00:40:49,00:40:51,What's Gin or Water?
00:40:51,00:40:52,"Oh, come on, Andy."
00:40:52,00:40:53,Come on.
00:40:53,00:40:54,"Come on, mate."
00:40:54,00:40:56,Did you never go to the first gin?
00:40:56,00:40:57,"No, I don't know it."
00:40:57,00:40:58,I've never played it.
00:40:58,00:41:00,But it's pretty obvious what it is.
00:41:00,00:41:02,Have you ever played Gin or Water soup?
00:41:02,00:41:06,What one glass is full of knives?
00:41:06,00:41:09,You have to guess which one you swallowed.
00:41:09,00:41:13,"You have to remain straight-faced,"
00:41:13,00:41:16,"regardless of whether you swallowed gin, water, or a dagger."
00:41:16,00:41:21,"Oh, so they look identical and you drink a glass."
00:41:21,00:41:24,"And then you have to, other people have to guess which one you've downed."
00:41:24,00:41:25,Other people have to guess.
00:41:25,00:41:28,"Right, keep a straight face if you've just had the water."
00:41:28,00:41:31,"Sorry, I was thinking that you have to drink it"
00:41:31,00:41:34,and you have to guess which one you've had.
00:41:34,00:41:37,"Andy, absolutely."
00:41:37,00:41:39,"I'm going, oh, I'm fantastic at this game."
00:41:39,00:41:50,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is James."
00:41:50,00:41:55,"OK, my fact this week is that Israel manually removed all color"
00:41:55,00:41:59,"from foreign TV broadcasts until 1981,"
00:41:59,00:42:02,"as they were worried that if they broadcast color TV,"
00:42:02,00:42:04,"everyone would rush out and buy new sets,"
00:42:04,00:42:05,which would crash the economy.
00:42:05,00:42:08,Amazing.
00:42:08,00:42:09,Isn't it?
00:42:09,00:42:11,What incredible.
00:42:11,00:42:13,"I mean, so many, so many questions."
00:42:13,00:42:17,So I can't understand how everyone buying a new TV set
00:42:17,00:42:18,would crash the economy.
00:42:18,00:42:23,"OK, so the idea was that the color TVs would have been made outside of Israel."
00:42:23,00:42:29,"And so it would kind of change the balance of their balance sheet,"
00:42:29,00:42:31,"basically, meaning that more people were buying things from abroad"
00:42:31,00:42:33,rather than buying things from at home.
00:42:33,00:42:37,There was a few other reasons that they didn't have color TV
00:42:37,00:42:38,for quite a long time.
00:42:38,00:42:41,Some people argued that it would cause social polarization
00:42:41,00:42:44,because some people would be able to afford color TVs
00:42:44,00:42:47,and some people wouldn't and they didn't want to do that.
00:42:47,00:42:49,Some people just thought it was quite unseemly
00:42:49,00:42:52,to have lots of television in the home.
00:42:53,00:42:56,"But basically, they came up with this eraser device"
00:42:56,00:42:59,"that whenever they got a movie in from a different country,"
00:42:59,00:43:01,it would just suck all the color out of it
00:43:01,00:43:04,and it would put it out as a black and white image.
00:43:04,00:43:08,"But people could buy an anti-eraser device,"
00:43:08,00:43:11,which meant that you could put all the color back in
00:43:11,00:43:13,and loads of people started buying these
00:43:13,00:43:16,and then they'd be able to get the foreign color pictures.
00:43:16,00:43:20,"And eventually, I think possibly because there was an election coming,"
00:43:20,00:43:23,"the Israeli government said, ""Hey, we're going to do color TV,"
00:43:23,00:43:25,"we're the last people in the world, pretty much,"
00:43:25,00:43:27,"but we're going to do it."""
00:43:27,00:43:29,"And then in '81, they did."
00:43:29,00:43:33,That reminds me a little bit that sort of the rubbing out
00:43:33,00:43:35,"and rubbing back in technology of something I read,"
00:43:35,00:43:38,which was a cheap alternative to color TV in the '60s.
00:43:38,00:43:40,So have you guys heard of this?
00:43:40,00:43:43,"In America in the 1960s, you could get color televisions,"
00:43:43,00:43:45,"but if you couldn't afford them, as many people couldn't,"
00:43:45,00:43:50,you could for $1 buy a colored transparent plastic screen
00:43:50,00:43:52,that you stock on top of your TV.
00:43:52,00:43:54,What? Where is it?
00:43:54,00:43:58,"I mean, obviously, it wouldn't work, right?"
00:43:58,00:44:01,"Because the grass would be orange, the sky would be green."
00:44:01,00:44:03,"James, they're not stupid, all right?"
00:44:03,00:44:05,So what they did is they had three colors on it.
00:44:05,00:44:10,"The top third was blue, the bottom third was green,"
00:44:10,00:44:12,and the middle third had a sort of reddish tint.
00:44:12,00:44:15,That works if all your TV shows are based on a beach.
00:44:15,00:44:17,"If you're watching Baywatch, absolutely smashing it."
00:44:17,00:44:20,That's why it did so well.
00:44:20,00:44:22,The bottom is green for grass.
00:44:22,00:44:22,It was green.
00:44:22,00:44:26,"So if you're watching footage only of a wholesale tomato market,"
00:44:26,00:44:28,"actually, it's unbelievably effective."
00:44:28,00:44:29,Absolutely.
00:44:29,00:44:32,And that happened to be the only program that was on throughout the 1960s.
00:44:32,00:44:32,So it's fine.
00:44:32,00:44:35,"But people did say it did, and I saw some pictures,"
00:44:35,00:44:37,and it does sort of make it a bit more exciting.
00:44:37,00:44:40,"Obviously, it didn't exactly match with the colors"
00:44:40,00:44:41,"that it was supposed to,"
00:44:41,00:44:44,but at least it made your television a bit more colorful to look at.
00:44:44,00:44:45,"No, it's right."
00:44:45,00:44:46,Isn't that great?
00:44:46,00:44:50,I can't believe that color TV was invented so early.
00:44:50,00:44:53,"So John Logan Baird, who was the great pioneer of TV,"
00:44:53,00:44:55,he demonstrated it in 1928 at his lab in London.
00:44:55,00:44:57,"He filmed a basket of strawberries,"
00:44:57,00:45:00,"and he invented more ways of doing it in the '30s,"
00:45:00,00:45:04,and it just didn't get picked up on for ages.
00:45:04,00:45:06,"Yeah, I guess it was just too expensive."
00:45:06,00:45:08,I think it was also a slightly different technology
00:45:08,00:45:11,that they used with Baird than they came up with eventually using.
00:45:11,00:45:15,But one of the things that Baird did was he had a demonstration
00:45:15,00:45:18,"with a young girl who would put different colored hats on,"
00:45:18,00:45:19,and this would show all the different colors.
00:45:19,00:45:22,"And this girl was called Noelle Gordon,"
00:45:22,00:45:27,"and she later became the first woman to interview a British Prime Minister,"
00:45:27,00:45:30,and she was an actor on Crossroads
00:45:30,00:45:34,who won the TV Times Award for Most Popular Actress on eight occasions.
00:45:34,00:45:39,But she began her career just changing hats in front of John Logan Baird.
00:45:39,00:45:42,"What? I mean, a colorful career."
00:45:42,00:45:43,"Exactly, yeah."
00:45:43,00:45:45,"Well, she wore a lot of different hats over the course of her career."
00:45:45,00:45:46,Very good.
00:45:46,00:45:48,All these great points.
00:45:48,00:45:50,"Can you say who the Prime Minister was, who she interviewed?"
00:45:50,00:45:51,Millen.
00:45:51,00:45:52,Can you say...
00:45:52,00:45:54,I like the fact that maybe it was...
00:45:54,00:45:56,"Sorry, that's secret."
00:45:56,00:45:58,"No, she was the first to interview a British Prime Minister."
00:45:58,00:46:01,"Sorry, it's one of the Prime Ministers I can't pronounce."
00:46:01,00:46:01,Sorry.
00:46:01,00:46:07,Don't you think it's so fitting that John Logan Baird
00:46:07,00:46:10,made the first demonstration of Color TV using strawberries?
00:46:10,00:46:14,"And we've mentioned before that before he went into inventing television,"
00:46:14,00:46:16,he started a jam factory.
00:46:17,00:46:18,Did he?
00:46:18,00:46:19,"Yeah, and maybe he had left..."
00:46:19,00:46:23,He was in Trinidad and he set up a jam factory.
00:46:23,00:46:26,And I think it didn't work out because insects kept infesting the jam.
00:46:26,00:46:31,And the reason he'd went anyway was to stop himself being such a sickly child
00:46:31,00:46:33,so he could get off with the girl that he loved.
00:46:33,00:46:34,"But when he came back, she was married anyway."
00:46:34,00:46:36,So the whole trip was a disaster.
00:46:36,00:46:39,But I reckon he must have come back with loads of surplus strawberries.
00:46:39,00:46:44,Do you think he maybe had some like ones which weren't ripe yet
00:46:44,00:46:46,and he kept them at the bottom of the screen
00:46:46,00:46:47,and then some ripe ones in the middle
00:46:47,00:46:49,and then some blueberries above them?
00:46:49,00:46:50,Yeah.
00:46:50,00:46:53,"Wait, this is like insider trading then,"
00:46:53,00:46:56,which you're not really allowed to do on some British TV.
00:46:56,00:46:57,"Well, you know, if there he is going,"
00:46:57,00:47:00,"""Look, Color TV, what he's really pushing is his strawberry business."""
00:47:00,00:47:01,"Yeah, that's true."
00:47:01,00:47:03,"Hang on, I have another link."
00:47:03,00:47:05,I have another link here and we're about to blow this thing wide open.
00:47:05,00:47:08,The True Fish Crime Podcast is back on the rails.
00:47:08,00:47:08,Let's do it.
00:47:08,00:47:13,The first Color TV broadcast in the UK was in 1967.
00:47:13,00:47:13,What was it?
00:47:13,00:47:15,It was the Wimbledon Tennis Tournament.
00:47:15,00:47:17,What do people eat?
00:47:17,00:47:18,Strawberries and cream.
00:47:18,00:47:22,"John Logie, you naughty, naughty boy."
00:47:22,00:47:23,John Logie bastard.
00:47:23,00:47:28,We have crumbled the very foundations.
00:47:28,00:47:34,Do you know what was the first advert in Color on ITV?
00:47:34,00:47:35,No.
00:47:35,00:47:36,Was it for a wave pool?
00:47:36,00:47:37,"No, it was for peas."
00:47:37,00:47:40,But they're a type of food.
00:47:40,00:47:44,"Bird's eye peas, yeah."
00:47:44,00:47:48,You're sort of like the crap detective who's the big part in one episode.
00:47:48,00:47:49,"I think, James, I'm sorry."
00:47:49,00:47:54,"This is why Schubert, Carrot and the Harkin."
00:47:54,00:47:55,That's what we used to be called.
00:47:55,00:48:02,"I realized, so Wimbledon was the first that was shown on,"
00:48:02,00:48:04,"I'm guessing that must have been BBC Two, right?"
00:48:04,00:48:06,Because that was after Emperor Involved.
00:48:06,00:48:10,So that was the first in BBC Two and that was in '67.
00:48:10,00:48:16,"In '69, BBC One officially went color with a lot of experiments."
00:48:16,00:48:21,"And the first full color program that they ever showed was Petula Clark,"
00:48:21,00:48:23,"who sang ""Downtown""."
00:48:23,00:48:24,"If you don't know her, you might know that song."
00:48:24,00:48:27,"♪ Down, down, everything, duh, duh, duh. ♪"
00:48:27,00:48:28,It's a big song.
00:48:28,00:48:30,"Sorry, I didn't bring my knife to this recording."
00:48:30,00:48:38,I love those songs where you only know one lyric and it's the name of the song.
00:48:38,00:48:49,"But they broadcast it for their first day of color at 12 AM on the 15th of November,"
00:48:49,00:48:51,because that's when the license kicked in.
00:48:51,00:48:56,"And then they shut off the channel till 10 AM, because there was no TV to be had."
00:48:56,00:48:59,"Yeah, so you got sort of like, you had to stay up, watch the one thing,"
00:48:59,00:49:03,"and then, okay, going forward, we're now playing not completely color, but more and more."
00:49:03,00:49:06,Do you know how Australia went color?
00:49:06,00:49:07,"Dan, you might know this already, actually."
00:49:07,00:49:11,"Well, I only know it through researching it, because I was curious about that."
00:49:11,00:49:15,Mad. It was halfway through an episode of a sketch show.
00:49:15,00:49:16,They introduced color to the screen.
00:49:16,00:49:20,"Yeah, it was called the Auntie Jack show, and it was completely like,"
00:49:20,00:49:22,"really sort of wild, crazy, Python-esque stuff."
00:49:22,00:49:24,It was in 1975.
00:49:24,00:49:27,"They said the color monster is going to take over the TV,"
00:49:27,00:49:30,"and a corner of the screen starts turning to color,"
00:49:30,00:49:32,and they're freaking out on the rest of the screen.
00:49:32,00:49:35,"And one of them says, ""Oh, no, it's got me. I'm completely in color now."""
00:49:35,00:49:37,"And yeah, it's slowly the whole screen."
00:49:37,00:49:42,"It's on YouTube, and it's barking mad, but it's very cool."
00:49:42,00:49:45,"It was a show that was really popular, but it had finished."
00:49:45,00:49:48,"So it was called the Auntie Jack program,"
00:49:48,00:49:52,and they brought Auntie Jack back who had been killed off
00:49:52,00:49:54,in the final episode of the previous series.
00:49:54,00:49:57,"So they sort of like, they brought her back to life."
00:49:57,00:49:59,"And it is like that Wizard of Oz moment,"
00:49:59,00:50:01,where it goes from black and white to color.
00:50:01,00:50:06,"And one of the actors is a guy called Gary McDonald,"
00:50:06,00:50:09,"who became Norman Gunston, one of the biggest satirists in Australia."
00:50:09,00:50:12,He invented the sort of Ali G mode of interviewing.
00:50:12,00:50:15,"He would go to real life events as a character, an interview."
00:50:15,00:50:20,"And he later appeared in Mulan Rouge in a scene doing Absinthe,"
00:50:20,00:50:22,where Kylie Minogue comes.
00:50:22,00:50:25,"And I just wanted to add that to show you I Can Learn from this podcast,"
00:50:25,00:50:28,and I now have to pronounce her name.
00:50:28,00:50:30,I'm now trying to trace back from Kylie Minogue
00:50:30,00:50:31,to the original fact.
00:50:31,00:50:34,There were so many different lily pads
00:50:34,00:50:35,that you let run to the other.
00:50:35,00:50:38,"Why don't you just say, you know who's sometimes on TV, Kylie Minogue?"
00:50:38,00:50:41,"Oh, that would have been better. Yeah, that's true."
00:50:41,00:50:43,"Well, Mulan Rouge, of course, is that's red."
00:50:43,00:50:45,"And in that, there's the green Absinthe fairy."
00:50:45,00:50:48,So it makes sense that a guy who was interested in color TV
00:50:48,00:50:50,would have been up for a role in the film.
00:50:50,00:50:52,"Guys, we've got to stop trying to blow shit wide open."
00:50:58,00:51:00,"OK, that is it. That is all of our facts."

00:52:20,00:52:22,"and then someone else would say,"
