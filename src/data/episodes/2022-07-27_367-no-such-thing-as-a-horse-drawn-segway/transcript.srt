00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:20,240
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

3
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,360
 from four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with

4
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:30,320
 Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin and once again we have gathered

5
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,200
 around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in a particular

6
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:42,640
 order here we go. Starting with you, Anna. My fact this week is that the world's first

7
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:50,160
 electricity power station was built to power an artificial rainbow. Wow, that is cool.

8
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:59,280
 It was the 1870s, late 1870s, 1877, 78 and we're in Bavaria and it was built for this king,

9
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,560
 King Ludwig II, known as the fairy tale king for reasons that will become obvious during this section.

10
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,200
 He used to be a frog, didn't he? He did, yeah.

11
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:16,800
 And he wanted to make himself this grotto. He wanted to recreate these things called blue

12
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,600
 grottos which are natural sea caves where the sunlight makes the water glow in all rainbow

13
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,680
 colors and so he decided, I've heard about this new invention, electricity and I think

14
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,440
 I'm going to use it and so there was a little power station set up which used a steam steam

15
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:39,360
 basically which powered a dynamo and that generated electricity. So spun some coils around magnets,

16
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,960
 generated electricity, you got a full on rainbow inside his personal cave. It is cool but you

17
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,800
 would think that they'd find something better to do with their electricity, wouldn't they?

18
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:54,240
 I can't think of any better use though. But it's amazing what he did install because that grotto

19
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,600
 is full of not only the first artificial rainbow to be powered by this station but

20
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,640
 also the first, like I've been to those pools where they create artificial waves and you see

21
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,600
 people going surfing on them indoors. The prototype basically of that was built for this grotto.

22
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,760
 The wave pool, yeah. It was a wave pool, the world's first known wave machine.

23
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,400
 I've spent so long trying to work out how that was powered and I can't work out if it's just

24
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,760
 directly steam powered or whether that was part of the electricity power station fueling it.

25
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,200
 Wait, are you talking about the Undosa wave pool? Because this was a little bit after he died.

26
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,960
 Danny, you're saying it was one inside the cave. Yeah, I'm saying it was one in the grotto, yeah.

27
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,360
 Because, okay, this is bizarre. So he died at Lake Stranberg, which is another thing we'll come

28
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,600
 on to Ludwig. He died there and then 20 years after he died, this is what I found, is that the

29
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:47,920
 first wave machine, the Velenbad or wave bath was built on the shores of Lake Stranberg and it was

30
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,320
 given the name Undosa as well, which is Latin for the wave kingdom and it was steam powered.

31
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:58,080
 The steam engines lifted up these massive pontoons and that pulled up water and then you crash back

32
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,040
 down and that created a bigger wave. Oh my God, that sounds so cool. And that was in the, what,

33
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:10,400
 the early, the late 19th, early 20th century and the next oldest one opened in 1912 and that is

34
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,880
 called the Biltsbad and it's still working today. There's a 109 year old wave machine. That's amazing

35
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:22,720
 because actually the one that I used to go to in Bolton in the 90s isn't there anymore. So that

36
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,080
 shows, doesn't it? It shows how well this one stayed. Sick transit, yeah. They used to build

37
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,880
 things to last in the olden days. They did, yeah. But did that mean on the pontoon, that's sort of

38
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,000
 a double ride, right? Because if you're in the water, you can surf the waves and then if you're

39
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,960
 sitting on the pontoon, you see soaring up and down that pontoon. That's great. They don't do

40
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,480
 that enough for rides where you're sort of half on the ride before you get onto the actual ride

41
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,320
 itself. That feels like a missed trick. You've invented that there now. I like it. I think it's

42
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,560
 a bit like when you're queuing for a ride and they have stuff to keep the queue occupied,

43
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,960
 don't they? Yeah, but they usually send like a drunken, dressed-up person who just harasses you

44
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,280
 and makes you do stuff you don't want to do in my experience. What theme parks have you been

45
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:10,080
 to? I was at the Sydney Museum when I was a kid and this drunken Cleopatra came up and she started

46
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:16,080
 harassing me, yeah. It feels like we stumbled more into a kind of therapy thing now than a,

47
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:20,640
 that's not a, you know, that's your least relatable bit of stand-up I've ever heard of.

48
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,240
 You know when you go through the museum and Cleopatra's drunk and she's harassing you?

49
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,520
 Did she show you her asp?

50
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:32,560
 Just on the waves that Ludwig made, I did read that they were mostly ripples.

51
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,200
 So there's a lot of claims but I'm not sure you could surf them. I think you made a good body

52
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:42,560
 board as a small toddler on his ripples if you really tried. But he was into lots of stuff if

53
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:50,160
 not surfing, wasn't he? And actually, I think the Speaking of Rides, the castle at Disneyland

54
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,760
 is based on Neuschwanstein Castle, which is one of his, isn't it? Yes. I think.

55
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:01,280
 Yeah, yeah, you're right. It's amazingly similar to Disney. Well, really, you realise how much

56
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:07,680
 Disney just nicks from Prince Ludwig. It's so unfair. And that was the same one that's

57
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,880
 used in Shitty Chitty Bang Bang in Bulgaria, the Neuschwanstein. Yeah, they filmed there, yeah.

58
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,680
 Someone said that it's quite tacky if close up. It's best from a distance.

59
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,960
 I've been there, I must say. Have you? Yeah, I think probably from the car park,

60
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:28,160
 which is the other side of the valley. It's an amazing photograph, definitely. That's my tip.

61
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,000
 If you're ever in Neuschwanstein, just go to the car park and take your photos from there and

62
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,560
 then go to a nice cafe over the road. So James, did you get to see, there's a few things in there

63
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,400
 that I found fascinating and he built them in a couple of these places. But one of the things was

64
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:46,720
 he didn't want to see his servants when he was eating. And so there's this table that he built

65
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,480
 where the table, when it was going to be laid, would be lowered through the ground to where

66
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,160
 the servants were and where the kitchens were and everything would be put on and then it would come

67
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,920
 back up. So if he sort of like, I guess, needed salt, he would send the table back down and then

68
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,920
 it would come back however many minutes later. But he didn't want to see anyone. Did you see that?

69
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,600
 I actually got that. Oh, that's Linda Hoff. That was Linda Hoff.

70
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,800
 I heard it was in both, actually. I heard that he built one there as well. But maybe I'm

71
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,400
 misreading that. The guy was wealthy. He could commission a table. But so there was definitely

72
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,920
 that at Linda Hoff. And that Linda Hoff was also where he had the peacock throne,

73
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,600
 which was a massive peacock. Also, there was a massive peacock statue,

74
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,720
 which he had placed on the lawn to clarify that he was in. So please don't bother him.

75
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,800
 That was his way of announcing that he didn't want any attention was a big statue of a peacock.

76
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,560
 I don't know. Maybe it would take people's attention away from him.

77
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,360
 That's a very good point. You can only look at one at a time.

78
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:49,120
 He was very anti-social. Kind of a weird loner with a peacock obsession, I think,

79
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,600
 because he also had a giant peacock made of emeralds hanging from one of his ceilings.

80
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,560
 But his castle, I think this was Linda Hoff castle, is big and had one bedroom.

81
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,640
 Wow, really? You are not having guests.

82
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:06,720
 When you're browsing property websites and you see a lovely looking house,

83
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,120
 and then you see one bed, you think. Yeah, but imagine if you went on to,

84
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,160
 I don't know what they call, right move or something, and you put your filters in,

85
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,320
 and you're just like, I just want a one bedroom house.

86
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,400
 And then you start by price, and then you get this thing, which is worth about 10 billion pounds.

87
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,200
 But you've got to uncheck wave pools.

88
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:31,040
 He had a favourite column at Linda Hoff.

89
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,560
 Don't we all?

90
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,840
 Yeah, it was just his personal favourite column. So every time he passed it,

91
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,440
 he couldn't help but stop to kiss it. He just loved it.

92
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,120
 And he also had a bust of Marie Antoinette, and every time he walked past it,

93
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,120
 he would stroke her cheek and bow to her.

94
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,720
 So he did have a few people in the house, they just weren't real.

95
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,600
 Well, he also would sometimes kind of sit around talking to Louis the 16th,

96
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,360
 who died quite a long time before.

97
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:01,520
 Because like you say, I mean, it's quite a sad existence in a way, isn't it?

98
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:07,520
 Because he was painfully shy and possibly some mental problems there as well.

99
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:14,960
 It was really, it's kind of a sad story, but with lots of beautiful things to see about it.

100
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,280
 With all these amazing things that he built.

101
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,120
 James, it's kind of like your car park thing.

102
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,480
 If you look at it from the right distance, it's incredibly magical and beautiful.

103
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,680
 And up close, actually, the reality is a little bit stranger and sadder.

104
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,680
 He was, I think it was Louis the 14th, he was obsessed with, but he was really into it.

105
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,960
 He definitely was seen talking to Louis the 16th for sure.

106
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,920
 Oh, maybe it's all the movies.

107
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,200
 Was that just in the air, James? Like if he was at his empty dinner table?

108
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,320
 Yeah, he would be sat at his dinner table, having a conversation with dead kings, basically.

109
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,760
 But I can't say it wasn't Louis the 14th, it could have been as well for sure.

110
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,720
 Only because he was, so he used to make his whole retinue dress up as Louis the 14th,

111
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,080
 sort of servants.

112
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,400
 He would imitate Louis the 14th in absolutely everything.

113
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,080
 He'd always dress up as him.

114
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,320
 He basically wanted, I think he was in love.

115
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,280
 This is my theory.

116
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,080
 He was very passionate in love with Louis the 14th and Wagner.

117
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,920
 These were his two idols.

118
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,240
 I think it's fairly certain he was gay.

119
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:15,520
 And so he imitated Louis and with Wagner, which this grotto was based on Wagner's Tannhäuser opera,

120
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:20,320
 which is like all about the Leuvenus' Grotto and how sexy it was.

121
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,560
 He used to write these letters to Wagner, which are the Rondche stuff.

122
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,880
 And put Wagner in quite a weird position, I think.

123
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,480
 The story of Wagner and Ludwig is extraordinary.

124
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,080
 Ludwig was basically obsessed with Wagner.

125
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,960
 And as soon as he became king, almost within weeks, he sent out his people to find him.

126
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,440
 And they had to hunt really far and wide for Wagner, because at that point,

127
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,600
 he was hiding from debt creditors.

128
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,280
 So he was in hiding and they managed to out him and go,

129
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,000
 "The king wants you."

130
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,280
 And he thought, "Oh my God, I'm in trouble."

131
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,640
 And they said, "No, he basically wants to pay off your debts

132
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,400
 and he wants you to live in this castle with him and he wants you to be his best friend."

133
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,840
 And Wagner was like, "Thank God, yes. Great."

134
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:12,160
 Yeah, Wagner would play his pieces in front of Ludwig, just him, right?

135
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,080
 He would be these massive, kind of amazing Wagnerian,

136
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,560
 obviously Wagnerian, because it was Wagner who wrote them.

137
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,120
 Are these amazing operas?

138
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,160
 And but only literally just Ludwig sat on the front row.

139
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,480
 A bit like your Edinburgh show's dad, I reckon, probably.

140
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,360
 There was a bigger audience at the start, but when Dan got onto his,

141
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,800
 you know, when you get on a theme park, material.

142
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,920
 The ghost of all the King Louis loved that shit.

143
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,320
 Oh dear.

144
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:46,320
 And so Ludwig was engaged to a woman for a small amount of time.

145
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,720
 This was his cousin Sophie Charlotte.

146
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,640
 And but basically what happened was they got engaged

147
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,680
 and Ludwig just kept cancelling the wedding,

148
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,880
 kept cancelling it, kept cancelling it and eventually I got pulled.

149
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,680
 But Sophie Charlotte's really interesting.

150
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,680
 This is a sad story, but kind of interesting.

151
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,600
 So she died in 1897 in a fire.

152
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,040
 She was at a charity event.

153
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,840
 There was a big fire, but she insisted that all of the visitors

154
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,320
 and all of the girls who were performing at this thing

155
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,200
 and all of the nuns, they were all taken out first.

156
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,920
 And she refused to leave until everyone else was safe.

157
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,680
 And she ended up dying in the fire.

158
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,280
 But actually the interesting part about it is she was,

159
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,840
 her body was found because she had gold fillings

160
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,520
 and she's possibly the first person

161
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,320
 who was ever identified by dental remains.

162
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,720
 History, yeah.

163
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,640
 What a claim to fame.

164
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,760
 Yeah, a sad one.

165
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,600
 But yeah, yeah, yeah.

166
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,800
 I was reading about the way he broke off the engagement

167
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,240
 and he wrote to her and he said in his letter, breaking it off,

168
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,040
 the main substance of our relationship has always been

169
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,560
 Richard Wagner's remarkable and deep new destiny.

170
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,320
 What do you think?

171
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,840
 Yeah, maybe not.

172
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,960
 He's just not that into you.

173
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:09,040
 He was deposed as from being king, right?

174
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,680
 Because they thought he was mad without any assessment.

175
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,640
 Well, there was an assessment by a few psychiatrists,

176
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,960
 but because he was living in a big castle,

177
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,040
 they couldn't really get anyone near him.

178
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,760
 So they kind of assessed him from the car park,

179
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,880
 if you could think of it that way.

180
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,600
 Were they just waiting for the peacock to go?

181
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,160
 Every day peacock's still there, nothing we can do.

182
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,840
 But then they sent a delegation from Munich

183
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,640
 to Neuschweinstein where he was living to declare him insane.

184
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,800
 But Ludwig got the local fire department

185
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,120
 to kind of form a little army in his outside his castle

186
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,480
 to stop them from coming in.

187
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,080
 And sure enough, the fire brigade did the job

188
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,000
 and they had to go all the way back to Munich

189
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,840
 and it was a bit later that they came with a few more heavies

190
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,120
 and they managed to take him

191
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,360
 and they took him to this lake, didn't they?

192
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,080
 Lake Stanberg, where he was kept.

193
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,880
 He was kept and then he was found floating dead

194
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,720
 in Lake Stanberg in 1886.

195
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,840
 And I read one account which said

196
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,840
 his doctor also was found dead floating in the lake.

197
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,440
 And that to me is sus.

198
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,840
 Because water was shallow, he was a pretty decent swimmer.

199
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,400
 He was a surfer, we know that much.

200
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,640
 Yeah, and there is a secret society to this day

201
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,920
 which once they're called the Google Manor

202
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,240
 and they're quite mysterious.

203
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,760
 They wear hoods and black robes

204
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,920
 and they keep petitioning the Prime Minister of Bavaria

205
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,640
 to have a big bust of him carved into a mountainside.

206
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,720
 Really? But the doctor who was found dead alongside him

207
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,080
 apparently had been assaulted.

208
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,880
 So there is a suggestion

209
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,560
 and I don't want to get into any more

210
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,160
 scurrilous suggestions like you, Andy,

211
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,520
 but I'm just going to put this out there.

212
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,560
 There's some people think that Ludwig killed himself

213
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,320
 and that he killed the doctor as well.

214
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,680
 Okay.

215
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,440
 There's a suggestion of that, I don't know.

216
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,120
 Or the doctor, the doctor ran after him

217
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,160
 was trying to save him.

218
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,840
 I thought maybe they fought in the water

219
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,000
 and sort of accidental drowning.

220
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,680
 But there is this quite weird twist

221
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,720
 which I will agree supports Andy's theory

222
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,440
 which is that a portrait of Ludwig

223
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,640
 has just been quite recently uncovered, discovered.

224
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,080
 And it was the portrait that was done

225
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,440
 a few hours after his death

226
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,800
 is that weird thing that they used to do.

227
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,240
 What? Yeah.

228
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,360
 And there's blood coming from his mouth

229
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,200
 and the argument is that if you just drowned

230
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,360
 then you wouldn't have blood falling through your mouth.

231
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,680
 I've got one more theory to chuck in about his death.

232
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,320
 Oh yeah, great.

233
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,760
 I think it's something that Andy hid on

234
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,160
 which no one else probably has touched on

235
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,760
 that's busted this case wide open.

236
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,800
 So the story I read is that he asked the doctor

237
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,760
 to go for a walk

238
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,560
 and then they were later found dead by this lake.

239
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,400
 Now could it be that Ludwig

240
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,640
 had noticed something extraordinary at this lake?

241
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,880
 Because only just a few...

242
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,680
 This is such a true crime podcast.

243
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,680
 Well, you've gone into.

244
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,800
 I swear the listeners are.

245
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,840
 We've got to follow it.

246
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:00,400
 Just a few short years later

247
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,440
 what billion-dollar industry erupts

248
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,680
 on the very shores of that lake?

249
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,840
 The wave machine industry.

250
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,240
 Yes.

251
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,040
 I think billion-dollar is a big claim.

252
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,640
 Ludwig said to the doctor,

253
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,200
 "Listen, mate, I found the spot where we can make

254
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,880
 the next stage of my prototype wave machine."

255
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,640
 There was a third person in the party

256
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,680
 who's not been recorded.

257
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,520
 It's too much of a coincidence.

258
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,520
 Oh, you mean Jonathan Wave Machine.

259
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,000
 Exactly.

260
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,960
 After whom the invention was named.

261
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,920
 It's something fishing in.

262
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,600
 Wow, that's a very entertaining and interesting theory.

263
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,040
 It's definitely worth saying, I think.

264
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,560
 Wow, our journey into true crime has been very smooth so far.

265
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,240
 Yeah, I don't think my favorite bird

266
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,360
 will shake themselves much.

267
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:54,960
 Okay, it is time for fact number two.

268
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,160
 And that is my fact.

269
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,400
 My fact this week is that some dinner knives

270
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,320
 in the 16th century had sheet music etched onto the blade

271
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,400
 so that guests could sing a blessing together

272
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,240
 before and after the meal.

273
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,840
 So this is a fact that I spotted on Twitter.

274
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,800
 It's a guy called Filippo Lorenzin

275
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,560
 who tweeted about these knives,

276
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,320
 which I just found astonishing.

277
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,120
 They're so beautiful.

278
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,600
 Wow, that's really cool.

279
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,200
 How big were dinner knives?

280
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,480
 I'll tell you what.

281
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,240
 How long was this piece of music?

282
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,200
 These were very much crocodile dandy size knives.

283
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,880
 And there's a lot of confusion about it.

284
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,080
 Took them out and went, "Call that a knife!"

285
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,560
 So if we were doing what the knives had said just then,

286
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,840
 and we were following James,

287
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,920
 James would have had his little tune there.

288
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,800
 But on my knife, I would have had a separate set of notes

289
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,240
 that would harmonize with James,

290
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,080
 as would you, Andy, and as with you, Anna.

291
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,240
 Have a good look harmonizing with what I just did.

292
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,400
 And so it would be a song that came out

293
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,920
 where everyone had a different part.

294
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,000
 So you weren't all singing the same notes.

295
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,320
 And so, yeah, a beautiful chorus would come out.

296
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,080
 Beautiful chorus.

297
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,080
 These guys are probably pissed at this stage.

298
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,440
 No one's a professional singer.

299
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,680
 They probably can't even read the music.

300
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,640
 Yeah.

301
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,240
 And so what's interesting about these as well

302
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,240
 is there's only 16 of these that we have,

303
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,960
 that we know of that exist.

304
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,800
 And they're in different museums all over the world.

305
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,480
 The V&A has a really nice one.

306
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,280
 And a great video of showing how the song could sound

307
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,960
 because they actually have one of their curators,

308
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,080
 Flora Dennis.

309
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,800
 She goes to a studio and has it sung out by proper singers.

310
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,560
 So you can actually hear the song that's sung.

311
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,440
 And the knives were a bit different.

312
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,680
 On one of them, one side, it would have the blessing

313
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,200
 before you started your meal.

314
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,720
 On the other side, it would be a thank you

315
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,480
 for the meal that you just ate.

316
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,960
 But they don't know how they use these knives

317
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,840
 because were they used as functional knives?

318
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,000
 You didn't really cut your own meat back then.

319
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,680
 That was something that your servants would do.

320
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,520
 There were people who had specific jobs for that.

321
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,080
 And also, it's a very flat knife.

322
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,440
 You could cut meat in theory,

323
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,520
 but it looked more like it was a serving knife.

324
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,160
 They were made somewhere in France in the 1550s,

325
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,080
 but they were made for an Italian client.

326
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,000
 We don't really know who that Italian client was.

327
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,040
 So there's a lot of confusion and mystery around it.

328
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,880
 But I'm sure true crime fish will get to the bottom of it

329
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,160
 before this fact is over.

330
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,080
 There is one theory.

331
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,880
 This was according to art historian Mimi Hellman.

332
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,680
 She thought that it was a way of checking whether your guests

333
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,080
 were kind of off with musical notation.

334
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,920
 And so if they didn't really understand the musical notation,

335
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,240
 then maybe they weren't good enough to be in your society.

336
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,200
 So it's a way of weeding out the nouveau riche.

337
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,440
 But they've already been invited to dinner at that stage.

338
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,080
 It's quite late to be weeding them out.

339
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,080
 Yeah, but you've got the Smiths have just moved in down the street

340
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,560
 and you're like, "Oh, let's have them over to dinner

341
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,080
 and let's see if they can hold a tune."

342
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,600
 Yeah, I like that.

343
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,200
 That's really, wow.

344
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,720
 We think it's a struggle remembering

345
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,040
 that you have to start from the outside and work your way in.

346
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:58,480
 But knowing musical notation,

347
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,240
 and then being able to strike the right pitch.

348
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,640
 And laying the table difficult,

349
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,280
 because if you miss one knife out, if you've lost a knife,

350
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,680
 or surely you need exactly the right number of guests,

351
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,680
 otherwise you're missing a crucial part of the melody.

352
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,320
 That's true.

353
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,960
 They used to be quite beautiful knives as well as musical.

354
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,880
 So your personal knives would have really nice

355
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,040
 ornate decorations if you had a bit of money.

356
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,920
 You'd have pictures of babies on them quite often, apparently.

357
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,960
 As in your own children or random babies?

358
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,640
 I think random babies may be cherubs,

359
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,400
 winged babies, flowers, peasants, feathers, darts.

360
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,520
 Oh, what a beautiful peasant.

361
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,920
 A bucolic rustic scene.

362
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,520
 You want to drop a peasant in there next to a haystack or something.

363
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,960
 Again, these must have been huge knives.

364
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,960
 This is according to B Wilson,

365
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,400
 obviously the sort of queen of crockery history.

366
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,120
 So good.

367
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,160
 And she said, "You would no more use someone else's knife

368
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,920
 than you'd use someone else's toothbrush."

369
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,760
 Oh, really?

370
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,280
 That's how I attach people work.

371
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,080
 Shall we quickly name check B Wilson's book,

372
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,640
 "Consider the Falk," which is one of the great

373
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,960
 non-fiction books over the last few years.

374
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,760
 And also features knives.

375
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,880
 Very misleading title.

376
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,440
 It's so good.

377
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,400
 It's such a good book.

378
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:18,320
 Hey, do you know in France, pointy knives were made illegal

379
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,960
 during the 1600s.

380
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,120
 Do you know by who?

381
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,360
 Oh, in what year?

382
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,800
 1669, I believe.

383
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,440
 In France.

384
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,360
 I say Louis the 14th.

385
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,040
 It's old mate, Louis the 14th.

386
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,480
 Yes, he's back.

387
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,760
 Back.

388
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,400
 Yeah, no, because there was this whole thing

389
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,040
 where there was a very influential cardinal

390
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,600
 who has a very impressive surname

391
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,320
 that I've tried pronouncing about 12 times before this started.

392
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,280
 You guys all know him.

393
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,160
 Richelor?

394
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:48,720
 Richelor.

395
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,360
 Richelor.

396
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,000
 Richelor.

397
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,680
 Cardinal Richelor.

398
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,560
 He was, you know what James was saying earlier

399
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:58,160
 about separating the nouveau riche from coming in

400
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,760
 if they were trying to pretend

401
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,880
 that they had singing or notation abilities.

402
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,200
 He had that with people bringing their own knives

403
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,520
 and they would come in and he noticed

404
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,080
 at one of the dinner tables that there was a guy

405
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,000
 who was sort of being really uncouth

406
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,200
 and picking his teeth with a knife

407
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,640
 and he was like, you're not a rich guy.

408
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,320
 You're just faking being a rich guy.

409
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,920
 I can tell by your manners.

410
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,040
 And so he banned all of the pointy knives

411
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,160
 coming to the dinner table

412
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,440
 and that's sort of where we started

413
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,880
 getting the much more rounded knife at the dinner table.

414
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,440
 Butter knife.

415
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,320
 Yeah, the butter knife.

416
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,200
 Dan, did he call this guy nouveau Richelor?

417
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,600
 If not, why not?

418
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,360
 Well, because I can't pronounce A the name.

419
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,560
 I almost just got away with nouveau Riche.

420
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,760
 I didn't quite pronounce that properly.

421
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,000
 It's the idea of even sandwiching those two together.

422
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,760
 He's a, I've lost sleep over.

423
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,680
 Wow, that's interesting

424
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,720
 because you would have assumed

425
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,080
 it was to stop the stabby, stabby dinner party thing, wouldn't you?

426
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,560
 Yeah.

427
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,640
 But it's just bad manners.

428
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,240
 I think it was a, it was a politician, wasn't it?

429
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,360
 It was Chancellor Seguier, apparently, who came round.

430
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,040
 Dad, why did you not tell us it was him?

431
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:07,680
 There's no one I can name in this entire anecdote.

432
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,680
 Annoyingly, except for Louie.

433
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:13,360
 Yeah, but it wasn't, it was an interesting Seguier

434
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,760
 from the previous Louie the 14.

435
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,480
 Oh, Jesus.

436
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,240
 So that would be so great if that was where he got his name.

437
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,880
 He just always facilitated the change in conversation.

438
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,480
 He always used to come to dinner parties

439
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,640
 on one of those scooters, which you can't fall off.

440
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,960
 They were horse drawn back then, of course.

441
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,960
 Horse drawn Seguier, that would be amazing.

442
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,600
 Are you familiar with the stupenda splendiferous butter upknife?

443
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,100
 Yep.

444
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,360
 It sounds fictional.

445
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,080
 Yeah, it sounds like it was made by Roald Dahl, doesn't it?

446
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,000
 That's his long name.

447
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,840
 I think it goes by the shorthand, the butter upknife.

448
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,440
 I'm so excited about this knife.

449
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,560
 I'm actually going to order one.

450
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:01,920
 It's a knife that was invented by a Kickstarter in 2014.

451
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,600
 It raised 360,000 Australian dollars in Australia,

452
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,560
 15,200 backers, for obvious reasons.

453
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:12,080
 What it has is it has like tiny little cheese grater type holes

454
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,120
 on one side.

455
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,560
 So when you run it along the butter,

456
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,120
 it splits the butter into little ribbons

457
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,040
 and that means that if your butter's hard,

458
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,520
 it immediately softens it because of the surface area

459
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,800
 and then you can spread it nicely.

460
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,760
 Okay, right.

461
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,720
 So it ends your trauma with breaking your bread into pieces

462
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,680
 that you always have in winter when your butter's too solid to spread.

463
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,360
 I had a look into my favourite knife.

464
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,680
 I realised I knew nothing about it.

465
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,160
 And it's a knife that I grew up watching on TV.

466
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,680
 It's the Ginsu 2000, the classic Ginsu knife.

467
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,880
 You guys know Ginsu, right?

468
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,320
 I've never heard of that.

469
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,280
 Maybe it wasn't as big here.

470
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,120
 There were lots of infomercials.

471
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,560
 It's quite a famous knife in America.

472
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,320
 So I guess in Hong Kong, we just must have had it.

473
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,000
 It was one of those ones where in adverts,

474
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,680
 they would show it cutting through a shoe

475
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,520
 and they would show it cutting through anything.

476
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,960
 This is the ultimate knife.

477
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,240
 Throw away the rest of your line.

478
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,080
 This is all so random, Dan.

479
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:02,960
 Ginsu, no.

480
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,200
 When do you ever need to cut through a shoe?

481
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,960
 No one ever goes to a shoe shop and thinks,

482
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,960
 "Oh, this is a bit big. I'll cut the end of it."

483
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,240
 You need to throw away your shoes, James,

484
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,240
 but your kitchen bin is so tiny.

485
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,000
 You have to take it apart.

486
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,920
 So is it an amazing, like a Japanese state knife kind of thing?

487
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,200
 Well, so this is what I thought.

488
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,600
 I thought Japanese technology has sort of samurai elements

489
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,040
 to the advertising that they did.

490
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,520
 Turns out that it was made in Ohio

491
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:36,720
 and it was named by these copywriters called Barry Betcher

492
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,760
 and Ed Valenti and a guy called Arthur Schiff.

493
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,880
 And the idea was they were like,

494
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,120
 "No one's going to buy it under its current name,"

495
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,720
 which was Quick Cut.

496
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,800
 And they thought, "Okay, let's give it a Japanese name.

497
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,920
 Let's call it Ginsu."

498
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,920
 And they turned it into a massive product.

499
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,480
 Immediately in America, it sold millions and millions.

500
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,000
 And it was one of those infomercials that coined the phrases.

501
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,440
 So it's the originator of,

502
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,200
 "But wait, there's more," that phrase that we all know.

503
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,000
 Wow.

504
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,520
 Brian Butterfield uses it a lot.

505
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,520
 That is from that advert, as well as Cool Now.

506
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,120
 Operators are on standby.

507
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,080
 Those were two lines that originated in these adverts.

508
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,720
 So the Ginsu was massive, but it's not Japanese at all.

509
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,800
 And it's not even a Japanese word.

510
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,640
 When the guy was asked, "What does it mean?"

511
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,640
 he says, it roughly translates as,

512
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,160
 "I never have to work again," because it was so successful.

513
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:26,880
 Yeah.

514
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,520
 Yeah.

515
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,320
 To be honest, I think no one in the UK has heard of that.

516
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,400
 So just when you've done your...

517
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,760
 You know what it's like when you're attacked

518
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,200
 by a drunk Cleopatra.

519
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,480
 How have you not heard of Ginsu?

520
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,320
 Some of our listeners, I'm sure, Dan,

521
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,160
 you've just absolutely blown their minds.

522
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,160
 But no, I've never heard of the Ginsu.

523
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:48,080
 I was just trying to see if it was as popular as I said it was.

524
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,160
 But I found another interesting fact just to lob in.

525
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,680
 So I was saying it cuts through shoes.

526
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:55,120
 It also is useful for cutting off penises,

527
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,400
 because Lorena Bobbit used a Ginsu knife

528
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,360
 on John Wayne Bobbit's penis when she lobbed it off

529
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,440
 while he was sleeping in 1993.

530
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,360
 Did that feature in the adverts as well?

531
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,560
 I'm sure they tried to.

532
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,240
 But wait, there's more.

533
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,920
 You could cut penises with it.

534
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:14,560
 Dan, what a... Just nothing to just lob in there.

535
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,240
 A Ginsu.

536
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,200
 They're world famous.

537
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,560
 Like, I can't believe they're not famous here.

538
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,440
 I am actually shocked they're not famous here.

539
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,360
 I mean, it's possible that the three of us

540
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,920
 have just lived a sheltered life and never heard of a Ginsu.

541
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,040
 Yeah.

542
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,240
 One of the odds.

543
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,560
 I think this is a dead thing.

544
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,400
 It's not. Ginsu is massive.

545
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,160
 Just one more thing on someone who loves knives.

546
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,440
 A guy called John Cummings.

547
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,480
 And he features in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine.

548
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,320
 And he proved, if you need it proving,

549
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,160
 that you should not swallow knives.

550
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,640
 And he did this because he was a sailor,

551
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,800
 and it's like late 18th century.

552
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,280
 And he'd seen a mountabank do the fake knife swallowing trick.

553
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,040
 And he said to all his sailor mates,

554
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,640
 "Mate, I can do that for real."

555
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,600
 And so he did.

556
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,680
 So he swallowed on the first attempt.

557
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,080
 He swallowed 19 or 20 knives.

558
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,760
 And he did have excessive pain in his stomach and intestines.

559
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,960
 He got some medical help.

560
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,080
 He threw up a lot.

561
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,680
 He pooed out quite a few of them.

562
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:13,040
 Yep. Knives were coming up and going down all over the shop.

563
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,760
 So I guess I was so impressed with him then,

564
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,680
 that he tried it a few more times.

565
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,480
 And every time he got drunk, apparently, on board,

566
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,720
 he'd say, "There was this time I swallowed all these knives.

567
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,560
 If you don't believe me, I'll do it again."

568
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,240
 And I think he ate about 40 different knives.

569
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,480
 And one clasp knife case as well.

570
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,000
 And he found it very unpleasant.

571
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,280
 He was in a lot of pain.

572
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,440
 He, again, vomited and pooed quite a few of them,

573
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,640
 but not enough to save him.

574
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,640
 And he visited a London surgeon.

575
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,280
 So when he landed, sure, he was a London surgeon.

576
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,640
 And the surgeon just didn't believe him.

577
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,680
 He said, "Look, I think I've swallowed about three dozen knives.

578
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,520
 Can you perform surgery?"

579
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,920
 And they said, "Don't be stupid. No one would do that."

580
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,560
 And a case, he'd swallowed a clasp knife case as well.

581
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,400
 What is the point of swallowing a knife case

582
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,080
 once you've already swallowed three dozen knives?

583
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,560
 No one's going to be extra impressed by that bit.

584
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,440
 If he could somehow jiggle around his insides,

585
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,520
 he might be able to get the knives into the case.

586
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,200
 Yes, maybe that was part of the trick he hadn't honed yet.

587
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,360
 It was the spider he was swallowing to catch the fly

588
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,600
 of the 36 knives he'd already swallowed.

589
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,160
 Sadly, much like the old woman who swallowed the fly,

590
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,440
 he died, of course.

591
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,960
 And then they did open him up,

592
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,240
 and they did find that he had about 30 to 40 fragments

593
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,640
 of wood, metal, and horn inside him.

594
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,640
 So he was telling the truth.

595
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,200
 Wow.

596
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,480
 So don't swallow knives, kids.

597
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,320
 Just on party tricks with knives,

598
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,960
 I discovered that there's a knife-throwing hall of fame,

599
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,840
 and it's a sort of group in America that it's all the people

600
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,800
 that you see when they stand someone against a wooden door

601
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,240
 and just chuck the knives at them.

602
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,360
 It's for that.

603
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,800
 So the list of people who are on the sort of greatest

604
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,480
 current knife-throwers, there's a guy called Ted Eisenberg,

605
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,480
 who's ranked 18th in the world at the moment for knife-throwing.

606
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,520
 He also holds a Guinness World Record for the most

607
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,880
 breast augmentation surgeries ever to be performed by a male.

608
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,760
 He doesn't do it by throwing the knife at the patient.

609
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,320
 If he's not combined the two, then he's missed a trick.

610
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,360
 He definitely should do that.

611
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,200
 There's Lorraine and Bobbitt, who does penis reduction surgery.

612
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,600
 With a ginsu or whatever it was.

613
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,640
 Ginsu, yes.

614
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,760
 Yes, see, you do know it.

615
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,560
 There's the great throwdini.

616
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,840
 The world's fastest and most accurate knife-thrower, he calls himself.

617
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,960
 And then there's Jack Dagger, the king of fling.

618
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:41,680
 Jack Dagger supposedly has invented the first new knife-throwing stunt

619
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,360
 in almost a hundred years.

620
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:43,760
 How?

621
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,080
 And it's called the cucumber slice.

622
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,800
 So he gets his assistant to stand up against the door

623
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:53,680
 and she puts her arm up horizontal and rests on it a full cucumber.

624
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,240
 And he throws a couple of knives.

625
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,360
 And then in this video, the third knife, he throws it

626
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:04,160
 and he slices the cucumber in half that is resting on her arm.

627
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:04,800
 That's the trick.

628
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,000
 That's the first new innovation in lengthways horizontal.

629
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,120
 Yeah, that's incredible.

630
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,160
 Yeah.

631
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:14,080
 So Jack Dagger, king of fling has, yeah, the first in a hundred years.

632
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,680
 And of course, he keeps a jug of pimps just beneath that cucumber.

633
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,440
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

634
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,960
 My fact is that almost all drug names in America have been approved

635
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,960
 by just two women in Chicago.

636
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,040
 Amazing.

637
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:40,640
 They're called Stephanie and Gail.

638
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,040
 And they are official.

639
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:45,680
 They do.

640
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,680
 They're Stephanie Schubert and Gail Carrot.

641
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,760
 But I just thought it sounded more mysterious

642
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,720
 if I just gave the first names.

643
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,520
 But they have their names.

644
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,040
 Schubert and Carrot were the sounded way more mysterious than Schubert and Carrot.

645
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,480
 Let's get some true crime going.

646
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,680
 One of them is a musician.

647
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,800
 One of them is a vegetable.

648
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,880
 Together they solve crimes.

649
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,840
 Schubert and Carrot.

650
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,200
 Incredibly unlikely friendship.

651
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:13,040
 So the reason that they have the responsibility

652
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,040
 for approving so many drug names

653
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,880
 is that they work for the United States adopted names program.

654
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,320
 So basically, there's a tiny bit of explaining to do here,

655
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,760
 which is that each drug made has three names.

656
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,720
 It's got the chemical name,

657
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,400
 which is unbelievably complicated and long.

658
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:32,640
 It's got the generic name, which is, you know...

659
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,560
 Like what scientists would call it or something.

660
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,040
 Exactly.

661
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:35,680
 Yeah.

662
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,800
 And then there's branded name,

663
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,880
 which is what the pharmaceutical company that makes it.

664
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,360
 You know, that's your anusol or whatever.

665
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,320
 That's a brand name.

666
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,920
 I believe it's pronounced anusol.

667
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,920
 Yeah, is it heck?

668
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,080
 It's so clearly anusol.

669
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,560
 The company says it's pronounced anusol.

670
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,520
 It's such bullshit.

671
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,960
 Does it actually?

672
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,440
 Yes, they do.

673
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,360
 They do adverts where it's anusol.

674
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,880
 And like, guys, lean in.

675
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,680
 Is this the work of Schubert and Carrot?

676
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:03,440
 I didn't mean to start talking about anusol this early.

677
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,200
 If anyone wants to know what anusol is,

678
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,960
 then it's worth looking into if you've just swallowed 35 knives.

679
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:14,800
 Oh, you're going to need the big tube, I think.

680
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,680
 Okay.

681
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,480
 So basically, sorry, it's completely distracted already.

682
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,240
 So drug makers, you know, they give the drug a chemical name,

683
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,840
 but you need a single generic name.

684
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,840
 And that then goes to the World Health Organization.

685
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,720
 So it has to be cleared,

686
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,360
 because the generic names are usually global these days.

687
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,600
 It has the same generic name throughout the world to avoid confusion.

688
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:38,560
 And when a drug firm has a new drug they want to give a generic name to,

689
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:42,560
 they write in to the USAN, which is pretty much just Stephanie and Gail.

690
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:46,400
 Sorry, Schubert and Carrot, please.

691
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,440
 Sorry, sorry, sorry.

692
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,520
 And they either approve the names if they're okay,

693
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,920
 but if it's too similar to an existing name,

694
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,160
 or it's inappropriate in some language maybe,

695
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,600
 or if it's linguistically unfair,

696
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,520
 they're the ones who come up with the new generic name

697
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,200
 and write back to the firm saying, hey.

698
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,880
 So they're like, sorry, we've got one of those.

699
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,560
 Have you thought of butthole soul?

700
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,600
 Yes.

701
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,480
 I think they wouldn't call it butthole soul,

702
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,560
 because that would be the brand name.

703
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:17,360
 It would be like, you know, butchersol.

704
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,920
 Well, so generic names are not allowed to refer to.

705
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,760
 They've got whole careers devoted to this.

706
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,720
 You can't on the spot, just to be honest, okay?

707
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,840
 These guys are experts.

708
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,440
 I've realised that now, you know.

709
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,360
 I think I was at a cocky attempt of you to make.

710
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,400
 It's classic, classic mansplaining, isn't it?

711
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,480
 Like, oh, I could do this job easily.

712
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,800
 And then as soon as I try, no way.

713
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,160
 It's very hard.

714
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,200
 Because, and just to say, neither anusol nor butthole soul,

715
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,680
 great name, would be accepted because the generic name can't refer to a body part.

716
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:51,280
 That's one of the guidelines that they say, because it's a generic thing.

717
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,040
 So, yeah, anyway.

718
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:57,280
 So yeah, and I actually wrote to Stephanie Schubat as part of this,

719
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:01,360
 just to check the process works and she wrote back saying, yes, that's the process.

720
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:06,560
 We didn't get the snappy ban to go, but that's because she's a professional.

721
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,760
 She's got a lot of drugs today.

722
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,960
 You're the next Michael Parkinson, Andy.

723
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,520
 I don't know how you get this stuff out of people.

724
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:18,880
 So, with the, say, like the current COVID vaccines, I guess that would be a process

725
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:22,800
 where they had to just fling it to the front and just go, we just need a name, right?

726
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,640
 We don't have time for all this stuff.

727
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,400
 Well, that's brand names, right?

728
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,760
 So generic names of drugs are the names that when a patient expires,

729
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,800
 then you just get the generic version, like ibuprofen or whatever.

730
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,480
 But at the moment, these are all, that's why they've all got lots of different names,

731
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,760
 these COVID vaccines.

732
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,360
 Well, some of them don't, though.

733
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,560
 That's the bizarre thing.

734
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:45,040
 The Pfizer jab, which gets referred to by literally 100% of people as the Pfizer jab,

735
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,480
 is technically called Corminati.

736
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,480
 Do you have to do it in a West Country accent?

737
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,800
 Corminati.

738
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:59,360
 It's a mix of community, immunity, mRNA and COVID.

739
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,720
 And it gets called Corminati.

740
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:06,720
 But the AstraZeneca one, it has a brand name in India, which is Covershield.

741
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,840
 And everywhere else in the world, it just gets called the AstraZeneca jab.

742
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,040
 Really?

743
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,680
 Yeah.

744
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,400
 The thing is that there are lots of different people who can name it.

745
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,880
 So there's the British approved names.

746
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:21,600
 So if there's any drug that's done in Britain, our version of Carrot and Shuba

747
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,520
 is the British approved names group.

748
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,520
 In France, they have the Domination Commune Française.

749
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,880
 In Japanese, they have Japanese adopted names.

750
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,080
 And all these people then feed it into the World Health Organization,

751
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,680
 who then make the final decisions.

752
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,400
 But in the '90s, there was a problem because loads of names were different

753
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,560
 all around the world before the WHO kind of got in on this.

754
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,000
 And there was a letter in the BMJ that gave 100 common drugs

755
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,440
 where the names was completely different in the UK than what it was in America.

756
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,200
 Just completely different.

757
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,240
 And if you look at some of the older things like Paracetamol,

758
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,720
 in English, it's Paracetamol.

759
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,480
 In French, it's Paracetamol.

760
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,320
 In Spanish, it's Paracetamol.

761
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,120
 In Russian, it's Paracetamol.

762
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,200
 And in the US, it's Acetaminophen.

763
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,680
 It's just completely different, isn't it?

764
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,440
 I mean, that's just a...

765
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,440
 I've always got to be different, haven't I?

766
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,320
 Yeah.

767
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,600
 See, that would be a name that Americans would be like,

768
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,360
 "Yeah, that's our name for it, right?"

769
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,320
 It's like ginsu.

770
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,600
 See, this is what I'm trying to say.

771
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:29,200
 You can have world-famous things that we're just oblivious to.

772
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,400
 And that's a good example.

773
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,680
 Half a second before he said it,

774
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,760
 I thought he's going to bring us back to the bloody knife.

775
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,440
 Interestingly, if you do get your penis chopped off,

776
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,240
 then Paracetamol is probably going to help a little bit.

777
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,200
 Again, do swallow Paracetamol.

778
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,400
 Don't swallow knives.

779
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,680
 Can't emphasize that enough.

780
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:50,960
 But this is why Shubert and Carrot are so crucial, I guess,

781
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,200
 is that America produces so many of the generic drugs

782
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,280
 that need to be spread around the world.

783
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,720
 And then it must be so difficult,

784
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,880
 because they have to make sure that they're not confusing

785
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,320
 in any language, right?

786
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,160
 So they can't have offensive names in any language.

787
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,400
 Although the only one that I could find,

788
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,240
 the only example they gave of one they rejected

789
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,280
 because it was rude, was a prefix to a drug name

790
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,480
 that was suggested as privy, P-R-I-V-I,

791
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,880
 which one of them said, "Sounds like an outhouse."

792
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:22,400
 Which I thought is quite a weird and prudish name to give for a toilet, but...

793
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,840
 Plastic Shubert, though, you know.

794
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,800
 She's prim.

795
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,960
 Carrot's the party girl, isn't she?

796
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,920
 And one problem with naming of medical stuff

797
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,320
 is that sometimes they have things that have funny names in medicine,

798
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,600
 so especially in genes.

799
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,520
 Have you guys ever looked at lists of gene names?

800
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,080
 They are amazing.

801
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,000
 This is where doctors really come into their own.

802
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,400
 So Tin Man, for instance, is one gene,

803
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,200
 and that's a gene that's required for proper development of the heart.

804
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,360
 The Spock, the Spock one gene.

805
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,360
 And if that is mutated, then...

806
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,080
 Is that your ears?

807
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,600
 Very good.

808
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,600
 Oh, give us some of those quizzes.

809
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,880
 Oh, yeah, okay, okay.

810
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,600
 Here we go.

811
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,680
 So in zebrafish, it gives them pointy ears.

812
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,920
 Cheap date, gene.

813
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,880
 Never orders a dessert.

814
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,400
 Makes you get drunk of one glass of alcohol.

815
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,840
 It metabolises it in a weird...

816
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,880
 Absolutely, bang on.

817
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,880
 Mutation spills susceptibility to alcohol.

818
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,680
 Okay, I will give you the Ken and Barbie genes.

819
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,560
 Two different genes.

820
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,360
 They remove the genitals.

821
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,960
 Very good.

822
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,320
 That should be the Lorena gene.

823
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,240
 Is that what it is?

824
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,520
 That's mutations on those genes mean that you lack external genitals.

825
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,360
 Again, it's mostly studied in zebrafish.

826
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,960
 Right.

827
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,160
 But then if you get ill, then it can be quite serious.

828
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,400
 And then you've got this quite funny name.

829
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,560
 So, for instance, I think there was a disease called catch-22.

830
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,280
 And it was a very clever acronym,

831
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,560
 which did the cardiac anomaly T-cell deficit,

832
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,240
 clefting and hypochalcemia for chromosome 22.

833
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,680
 Very good.

834
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,040
 It's something quite serious when you've got it.

835
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,240
 And the name catch-22 sounds like it's a no-win situation.

836
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,280
 That's one of those things where enough people are diagnosed.

837
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,560
 They said, "I don't really want a disease

838
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,160
 that's called the catch-22 disease."

839
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,920
 What? It's like, did you catch one disease?

840
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,120
 Catch one disease?

841
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,240
 I caught 22.

842
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:22,240
 You know, the same bloke invented heroin and aspirin

843
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,360
 within the same two weeks.

844
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,640
 Really?

845
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,360
 Yeah.

846
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,080
 You know Felix Hoffman working at Bayer?

847
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:28,960
 Oh, Hoffman.

848
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,320
 Are they related to each other?

849
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,200
 Like, is it almost like you just add salt to one?

850
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,000
 Or is it completely different medicines?

851
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,520
 He was adding, yeah, kind of.

852
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,360
 He was adding acetyl.

853
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,840
 He was acetylizing various different molecules.

854
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:45,680
 Now, both had kind of been created.

855
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,200
 Those chemicals have been created previously,

856
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,920
 but they hadn't been commercialized or made in a stable form.

857
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,000
 Was Hoffman the one who took loads of heroin and then cycled home?

858
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:54,480
 Or...

859
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,360
 I thought that was the LSD guy.

860
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,320
 Timothy Leary.

861
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,360
 Maybe it was.

862
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,160
 No, I think you're right.

863
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,280
 I think it's Hoffman.

864
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,240
 Yeah, I think it's Hoffman.

865
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,840
 I thought he'd take an LSD and cycled home.

866
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,120
 Maybe, I can't really remember.

867
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,480
 Yeah.

868
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,800
 But I mean, the thing is, we sort of think it's funny now

869
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:15,680
 that heroin was marketed as a cough medicine by Bayer.

870
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,080
 But actually tuberculosis and pneumonia

871
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,640
 were such massive causes of death

872
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,440
 that it was very useful to have a cough remedy.

873
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,040
 Like, it was a really desperate need.

874
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,040
 And within a year, you could get heroin pastels,

875
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:27,840
 which I didn't know.

876
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:29,920
 Would they flavor them?

877
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,120
 You know, it tastes nice if you had a raspberry flavor to it.

878
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:33,760
 I don't know.

879
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,720
 I don't know if they'll flavor them.

880
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,760
 That's a good way.

881
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,400
 You could play Russian roulette with fruit pastels, couldn't you?

882
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,600
 Well, one of them has got heroin.

883
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,000
 Yes.

884
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,200
 Wow, that is the progression of the game Gin or Water,

885
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,880
 which is one of my favorite games.

886
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,920
 I think heroin with pastels is the next stage.

887
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,520
 What's Gin or Water?

888
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,560
 Oh, come on, Andy.

889
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,280
 Come on.

890
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,000
 Come on, mate.

891
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,400
 Did you never go to the first gin?

892
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,200
 No, I don't know it.

893
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,000
 I've never played it.

894
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,240
 But it's pretty obvious what it is.

895
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,000
 Have you ever played Gin or Water soup?

896
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,800
 What one glass is full of knives?

897
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,840
 You have to guess which one you swallowed.

898
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:13,680
 You have to remain straight-faced,

899
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,400
 regardless of whether you swallowed gin, water, or a dagger.

900
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:21,280
 Oh, so they look identical and you drink a glass.

901
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,160
 And then you have to, other people have to guess which one you've downed.

902
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,840
 Other people have to guess.

903
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,880
 Right, keep a straight face if you've just had the water.

904
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,120
 Sorry, I was thinking that you have to drink it

905
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,640
 and you have to guess which one you've had.

906
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,600
 Andy, absolutely.

907
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,520
 I'm going, oh, I'm fantastic at this game.

908
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:50,800
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is James.

909
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:55,120
 OK, my fact this week is that Israel manually removed all color

910
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:59,280
 from foreign TV broadcasts until 1981,

911
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,160
 as they were worried that if they broadcast color TV,

912
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,400
 everyone would rush out and buy new sets,

913
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,840
 which would crash the economy.

914
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,400
 Amazing.

915
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,600
 Isn't it?

916
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,520
 What incredible.

917
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,200
 I mean, so many, so many questions.

918
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:17,120
 So I can't understand how everyone buying a new TV set

919
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,080
 would crash the economy.

920
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:23,440
 OK, so the idea was that the color TVs would have been made outside of Israel.

921
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:29,280
 And so it would kind of change the balance of their balance sheet,

922
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,760
 basically, meaning that more people were buying things from abroad

923
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,360
 rather than buying things from at home.

924
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:37,360
 There was a few other reasons that they didn't have color TV

925
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,320
 for quite a long time.

926
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:41,760
 Some people argued that it would cause social polarization

927
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,960
 because some people would be able to afford color TVs

928
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,120
 and some people wouldn't and they didn't want to do that.

929
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,760
 Some people just thought it was quite unseemly

930
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,560
 to have lots of television in the home.

931
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,640
 But basically, they came up with this eraser device

932
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,120
 that whenever they got a movie in from a different country,

933
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,360
 it would just suck all the color out of it

934
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:04,640
 and it would put it out as a black and white image.

935
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,720
 But people could buy an anti-eraser device,

936
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,120
 which meant that you could put all the color back in

937
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,040
 and loads of people started buying these

938
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,640
 and then they'd be able to get the foreign color pictures.

939
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:20,080
 And eventually, I think possibly because there was an election coming,

940
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,520
 the Israeli government said, "Hey, we're going to do color TV,

941
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,760
 we're the last people in the world, pretty much,

942
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,680
 but we're going to do it."

943
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,200
 And then in '81, they did.

944
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:33,440
 That reminds me a little bit that sort of the rubbing out

945
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,760
 and rubbing back in technology of something I read,

946
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,480
 which was a cheap alternative to color TV in the '60s.

947
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,560
 So have you guys heard of this?

948
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,520
 In America in the 1960s, you could get color televisions,

949
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,840
 but if you couldn't afford them, as many people couldn't,

950
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:50,640
 you could for $1 buy a colored transparent plastic screen

951
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,480
 that you stock on top of your TV.

952
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,160
 What? Where is it?

953
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:58,000
 I mean, obviously, it wouldn't work, right?

954
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,200
 Because the grass would be orange, the sky would be green.

955
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,360
 James, they're not stupid, all right?

956
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,840
 So what they did is they had three colors on it.

957
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:10,800
 The top third was blue, the bottom third was green,

958
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,880
 and the middle third had a sort of reddish tint.

959
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,280
 That works if all your TV shows are based on a beach.

960
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,840
 If you're watching Baywatch, absolutely smashing it.

961
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:20,400
 That's why it did so well.

962
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,320
 The bottom is green for grass.

963
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:22,800
 It was green.

964
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,400
 So if you're watching footage only of a wholesale tomato market,

965
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,400
 actually, it's unbelievably effective.

966
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,200
 Absolutely.

967
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,000
 And that happened to be the only program that was on throughout the 1960s.

968
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:32,960
 So it's fine.

969
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,360
 But people did say it did, and I saw some pictures,

970
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,200
 and it does sort of make it a bit more exciting.

971
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,240
 Obviously, it didn't exactly match with the colors

972
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,440
 that it was supposed to,

973
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,720
 but at least it made your television a bit more colorful to look at.

974
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,680
 No, it's right.

975
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:46,560
 Isn't that great?

976
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:50,240
 I can't believe that color TV was invented so early.

977
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,120
 So John Logan Baird, who was the great pioneer of TV,

978
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:55,920
 he demonstrated it in 1928 at his lab in London.

979
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,520
 He filmed a basket of strawberries,

980
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,320
 and he invented more ways of doing it in the '30s,

981
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:04,400
 and it just didn't get picked up on for ages.

982
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,160
 Yeah, I guess it was just too expensive.

983
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,720
 I think it was also a slightly different technology

984
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,760
 that they used with Baird than they came up with eventually using.

985
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,040
 But one of the things that Baird did was he had a demonstration

986
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,080
 with a young girl who would put different colored hats on,

987
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,840
 and this would show all the different colors.

988
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,480
 And this girl was called Noelle Gordon,

989
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:27,680
 and she later became the first woman to interview a British Prime Minister,

990
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:30,400
 and she was an actor on Crossroads

991
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:34,640
 who won the TV Times Award for Most Popular Actress on eight occasions.

992
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:39,520
 But she began her career just changing hats in front of John Logan Baird.

993
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,080
 What? I mean, a colorful career.

994
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,040
 Exactly, yeah.

995
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,840
 Well, she wore a lot of different hats over the course of her career.

996
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:46,960
 Very good.

997
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,720
 All these great points.

998
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,800
 Can you say who the Prime Minister was, who she interviewed?

999
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:51,760
 Millen.

1000
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:52,560
 Can you say...

1001
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,000
 I like the fact that maybe it was...

1002
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,320
 Sorry, that's secret.

1003
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,000
 No, she was the first to interview a British Prime Minister.

1004
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,200
 Sorry, it's one of the Prime Ministers I can't pronounce.

1005
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:01,600
 Sorry.

1006
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:07,520
 Don't you think it's so fitting that John Logan Baird

1007
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,400
 made the first demonstration of Color TV using strawberries?

1008
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,480
 And we've mentioned before that before he went into inventing television,

1009
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,000
 he started a jam factory.

1010
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:18,320
 Did he?

1011
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,840
 Yeah, and maybe he had left...

1012
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:23,600
 He was in Trinidad and he set up a jam factory.

1013
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,800
 And I think it didn't work out because insects kept infesting the jam.

1014
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:31,360
 And the reason he'd went anyway was to stop himself being such a sickly child

1015
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,040
 so he could get off with the girl that he loved.

1016
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,640
 But when he came back, she was married anyway.

1017
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,800
 So the whole trip was a disaster.

1018
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,600
 But I reckon he must have come back with loads of surplus strawberries.

1019
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:44,000
 Do you think he maybe had some like ones which weren't ripe yet

1020
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
 and he kept them at the bottom of the screen

1021
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,600
 and then some ripe ones in the middle

1022
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,120
 and then some blueberries above them?

1023
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,640
 Yeah.

1024
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,440
 Wait, this is like insider trading then,

1025
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,080
 which you're not really allowed to do on some British TV.

1026
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,520
 Well, you know, if there he is going,

1027
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,240
 "Look, Color TV, what he's really pushing is his strawberry business."

1028
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,840
 Yeah, that's true.

1029
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,280
 Hang on, I have another link.

1030
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,600
 I have another link here and we're about to blow this thing wide open.

1031
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,320
 The True Fish Crime Podcast is back on the rails.

1032
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:08,800
 Let's do it.

1033
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:13,120
 The first Color TV broadcast in the UK was in 1967.

1034
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:13,840
 What was it?

1035
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,600
 It was the Wimbledon Tennis Tournament.

1036
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,280
 What do people eat?

1037
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,320
 Strawberries and cream.

1038
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:22,080
 John Logie, you naughty, naughty boy.

1039
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:23,600
 John Logie bastard.

1040
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:28,560
 We have crumbled the very foundations.

1041
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:34,640
 Do you know what was the first advert in Color on ITV?

1042
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,040
 No.

1043
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,320
 Was it for a wave pool?

1044
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:37,920
 No, it was for peas.

1045
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:40,080
 But they're a type of food.

1046
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:44,320
 Bird's eye peas, yeah.

1047
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:48,000
 You're sort of like the crap detective who's the big part in one episode.

1048
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,200
 I think, James, I'm sorry.

1049
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:54,400
 This is why Schubert, Carrot and the Harkin.

1050
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,520
 That's what we used to be called.

1051
00:47:55,520 --> 00:48:02,240
 I realized, so Wimbledon was the first that was shown on,

1052
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,560
 I'm guessing that must have been BBC Two, right?

1053
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,320
 Because that was after Emperor Involved.

1054
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:10,880
 So that was the first in BBC Two and that was in '67.

1055
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:16,480
 In '69, BBC One officially went color with a lot of experiments.

1056
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:21,120
 And the first full color program that they ever showed was Petula Clark,

1057
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,120
 who sang "Downtown".

1058
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,640
 If you don't know her, you might know that song.

1059
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,440
 ♪ Down, down, everything, duh, duh, duh. ♪

1060
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,320
 It's a big song.

1061
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:30,240
 Sorry, I didn't bring my knife to this recording.

1062
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:38,080
 I love those songs where you only know one lyric and it's the name of the song.

1063
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:49,280
 But they broadcast it for their first day of color at 12 AM on the 15th of November,

1064
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,520
 because that's when the license kicked in.

1065
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:56,240
 And then they shut off the channel till 10 AM, because there was no TV to be had.

1066
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,200
 Yeah, so you got sort of like, you had to stay up, watch the one thing,

1067
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:03,680
 and then, okay, going forward, we're now playing not completely color, but more and more.

1068
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,000
 Do you know how Australia went color?

1069
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,520
 Dan, you might know this already, actually.

1070
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:11,360
 Well, I only know it through researching it, because I was curious about that.

1071
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:15,280
 Mad. It was halfway through an episode of a sketch show.

1072
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,720
 They introduced color to the screen.

1073
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:20,400
 Yeah, it was called the Auntie Jack show, and it was completely like,

1074
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,880
 really sort of wild, crazy, Python-esque stuff.

1075
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,240
 It was in 1975.

1076
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:27,200
 They said the color monster is going to take over the TV,

1077
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,320
 and a corner of the screen starts turning to color,

1078
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,560
 and they're freaking out on the rest of the screen.

1079
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:35,200
 And one of them says, "Oh, no, it's got me. I'm completely in color now."

1080
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,920
 And yeah, it's slowly the whole screen.

1081
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:42,320
 It's on YouTube, and it's barking mad, but it's very cool.

1082
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:45,120
 It was a show that was really popular, but it had finished.

1083
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:48,240
 So it was called the Auntie Jack program,

1084
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:52,240
 and they brought Auntie Jack back who had been killed off

1085
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,160
 in the final episode of the previous series.

1086
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,280
 So they sort of like, they brought her back to life.

1087
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,040
 And it is like that Wizard of Oz moment,

1088
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,680
 where it goes from black and white to color.

1089
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:06,080
 And one of the actors is a guy called Gary McDonald,

1090
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:09,440
 who became Norman Gunston, one of the biggest satirists in Australia.

1091
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,480
 He invented the sort of Ali G mode of interviewing.

1092
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,760
 He would go to real life events as a character, an interview.

1093
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:20,080
 And he later appeared in Mulan Rouge in a scene doing Absinthe,

1094
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:22,080
 where Kylie Minogue comes.

1095
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:25,440
 And I just wanted to add that to show you I Can Learn from this podcast,

1096
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,160
 and I now have to pronounce her name.

1097
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,880
 I'm now trying to trace back from Kylie Minogue

1098
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:31,920
 to the original fact.

1099
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,240
 There were so many different lily pads

1100
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,840
 that you let run to the other.

1101
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:38,880
 Why don't you just say, you know who's sometimes on TV, Kylie Minogue?

1102
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,360
 Oh, that would have been better. Yeah, that's true.

1103
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:43,680
 Well, Mulan Rouge, of course, is that's red.

1104
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,520
 And in that, there's the green Absinthe fairy.

1105
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:48,560
 So it makes sense that a guy who was interested in color TV

1106
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,720
 would have been up for a role in the film.

1107
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,960
 Guys, we've got to stop trying to blow shit wide open.

1108
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:00,960
 OK, that is it. That is all of our facts.

1109
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,400

 Very exciting emails.

1121

 We're also dribbling very slowly, all of the 20 hours.

1122

 Speak for yourself.

1123
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:46,080
 We're slowly dribbling all of the clips up

1124
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:48,880
 from our 20-hour-long marathon that we did for Comic Relief,

1125
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,560
 featuring 35 different guests.

1126
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:51,520
 If you've not seen them yet,

1127
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,360
 head to the quite interesting channel on YouTube

1128
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,400
 and check them out.

1129
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,600
 They're really, really fun.

00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,680
 And if you can still help with any kind of donation

1131

 towards our cause, comicrelief.com/fish, please do.

1132
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:03,280
 I say it's our cause, it's Richard Curtis's.

1133
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,920
 But yes, we will be back again next week,

1134
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:06,960
 and we'll see you then.

1135
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:07,520
 Goodbye.

1136
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:18,800
 James, when you and @ShoobatKarrot solved a case,

1137
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,720
 did one of you say, "Looks like we solved it,"

1138
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,000
 and then someone else would say,

1139
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
 "I think you mean we Anna solved it?"

1140
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,400
 (laughing)

1141
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,160
 I solved it, and you solved it.

1142
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,160
 (laughing)

1143
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:46,160
 (upbeat music)
