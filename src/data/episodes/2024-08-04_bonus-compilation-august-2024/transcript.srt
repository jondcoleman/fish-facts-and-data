00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,460
 Hey, Clubfish members! Dan here. Welcome to your bonus bit of content for this week.

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:11,540
 We've got a compilation for you. But before I get into that, I want to quickly announce

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:17,320
 a very exciting thing. We're putting on a last minute live show in London on the 12th

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:22,880
 of August at 7pm. So that's this coming Monday. It's going to be at the Underbelly Boulevard,

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:29,160
 which is in Soho. It's an amazing venue. We're going to be recording a live episode and we're

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,520
 going to be testing out a lot of fun, silly things. This is a show that is a warm-up in

7
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,640
 lead-up to our tour. We've come up with a bunch of ideas. We're going to be doing them

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,760
 throughout the night. It's going to be fun as hell. It's going to be silly as shit. It's

9
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,680
 going to be wonderful. So if you want to come along, do get yourself a ticket. It's not

10
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,200
 the biggest of venues, so tickets will fly out quick. You can do that by heading to the

11
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,960
 Underbelly Boulevard website, underbellyboulvard.com, and you can get your tickets there. The show

12
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:03,200
 starts at 7pm, Monday, August 12th. Okay, let's get into this compilation. You're

13
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,200
 going to hear a few voices that aren't the regular fishes in here. These are the outtakes

14
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,160
 that were grabbed from the full-episode recordings and you'll be hearing from two amazing guests.

15
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:19,240
 We have Marine biologist Helen Scales and then BBC Radio's film critic Ali Plumb. It's

16
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:34,960
 a great app, so let's get on with it. On with the compilation.

17
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:59,480
 I think Ali Plumb can sleep well at night. No, I think I've seen the trailer, but I'm

18
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:03,120
 interested in it because it's George Miller who made Mad Max, you know. Of course it is,

19
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:10,400
 but I'm just thinking about the similar themes because it's an extreme environment. Yeah,

20
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:19,560
 end of the world is nigh. Are there any flamethrowers in Happy Feet? Again, I don't know, but you've

21
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:26,040
 got a penguin who can't sing, but he can dance. And in Mad Max, you've got a road warrior

22
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:32,880
 who is not mentally very well, but he is very good at road war. Is this what you're

23
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,960
 talking about? This is why you've raised us, is to do the comparison between Happy Feet,

24
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,840
 which you haven't seen, and Mad Max, which you have. Yeah. I feel like I've seen Mad

25
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,440
 Max so many times that it sort of makes up for never seeing Happy Feet. You need to find

26
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,720
 the person who's seen Happy Feet and not Mad Max, and then you guys can get together

27
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,800
 and have a good old chat. Can I throw one more thing in about penguins? We can always just

28
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,360
 cut this bit out, but I just really love this fact, is how they evolved. So about 20 million

29
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,040
 years ago, penguins, as we know them, there were some ones before that, which were really

30
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:05,280
 big and we'll just leave them to one side for now. But penguins, we know of them, started

31
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,960
 about 20 million years ago on islands near New Zealand. And basically, there's like this

32
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,880
 big strong current that spins around Antarctica, which is one of the reasons why it's really

33
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,840
 cold, because it just goes round and round and then the warm water from everywhere else

34
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,880
 doesn't get into Antarctica. The southern ocean just gets colder and colder. And basically,

35
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:27,040
 penguins rode that current around the continent and evolved into different species as they

36
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,640
 evolved. So they went from the islands, they came down to Antarctica. The first ones to

37
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,120
 evolve were the big ones, the emperor penguins and the king penguins, which are the big,

38
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,280
 tall ones. They kind of became more and more adapted to these cold conditions as they went

39
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:44,600
 and evolved into other things, like cadaloupe penguins and chinstrap. Then a bit more recently,

40
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:50,480
 like about 11 million years ago, this current strengthened. And can you guess what happened

41
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,320
 next? So basically, the penguins then just pinged off to other parts of the ocean, riding

42
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:59,680
 this stronger current and went off to South America, went off to South Africa and to all

43
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,520
 the other places where you see them now. So they started Antarctica, evolved there, spun

44
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:08,760
 around the continent on this current and then basically like did a sort of slingshot, we

45
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,760
 think off to the other bits.

46
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,240
 Because they're all southern hemisphere aren't they?

47
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,640
 They're all southern hemisphere. They don't go beyond the equator. So the Galapagos Islands

48
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:21,040
 is the furthest north and that's really because it's got that cold current anyway. And well,

49
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,480
 we could talk about where there were no penguins in the North Pole, but they just didn't really

50
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:30,080
 get there. And I think it didn't go far enough, but I just love this idea of them raiding the

51
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,200
 current and then coming all the way back around and going, my God, you've changed 100 million

52
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,200
 years ago. Jesus.

53
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:42,360
 No, so this is the thing. This was the thing that used to happen. It happened in Scotland

54
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,560
 and in the USA as well in the 19th century, you would just put your wedding presents on

55
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:53,520
 display. And it was a normal thing to go to the house and see what had been given.

56
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,040
 A little gallery. You were in a museum pretty much. Because it incentivises the gift givers

57
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,560
 to give you something good, which is nice.

58
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,560
 Yeah.

59
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,560
 The names on them. This is from Aunty Maudry.

60
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,560
 Thinking names are removed actually. When you go around, you can say, yeah, I actually

61
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,040
 gave them. I gave them that big one there and got that one tea spoon.

62
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,040
 It's like a secret santa.

63
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:15,440
 But sometimes they would include the bride's trousseau as part of the display.

64
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,440
 What's a trousseau?

65
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,440
 You know, happy things you don't want to.

66
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,440
 Well, undercrackers basically. Trousseau is a trousseau.

67
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,440
 Sounds a bit more substantial.

68
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,440
 It's rarely a song.

69
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,440
 No, it won't be undergarments. It will be silken.

70
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,440
 A picture of them being sort of petticoate sort of things.

71
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,440
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because they were high quality things that you would get given as part of a

72
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,440
 wedding, you know, almost similar to a dowry, I suppose.

73
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,440
 I think our grandparents' generation sort of did this as well. I'm sure that it was

74
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,440
 still about the 1940s or '50s, that it was sort of you'd have like a tea party where

75
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,440
 people would come and look at your wedding gifts. And I think you could put, if you got a check,

76
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,440
 you'd put the check on display. That's there. You'd cross out the name, like you say.

77
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,440
 But, you know. That'd be amazing.

78
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,440
 That's me. That's my 10 grand there.

79
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,440
 Then I think like these days you don't get those big novelty checks as much as you used to.

80
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,440
 I was thinking about that the other day actually.

81
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,440
 Yeah, I was. I was like, do we still have them? And could you still walk into a bank with a

82
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,440
 massive novelty check? Because these days they're like, we don't take checks, do they?

83
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,440
 No one takes checks.

84
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,440
 That's the saddest part of like the 21st century, I think.

85
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,440
 Yeah, I think we've lost.

86
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,440
 You have to go with your massive debit card.

87
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,440
 A massive Bitcoin.

88
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,440
 Think another huge machine for the bank.

89
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,440
 By the way, one last spoof name that I love, if you haven't seen this film, it's called

90
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:39,440
 Murder by Death. And it is a pastiche of all of your favourite detectives.

91
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,440
 It's got Nick and Nora. It's got every who done it basically.

92
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,440
 Poirot, Marple, Charlie Chan, the whole thing.

93
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,440
 But the name Murder by Death, I adore it.

94
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,440
 You must watch this movie. If you enjoy Knives Out and all of that stuff.

95
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,440
 It's a real gem. 1976.

96
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,440
 So it's good beyond the name.

97
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,440
 Correct.

98
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,440
 From this.

99
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,440
 Enough of a joke. Move on. Who needs cinema?

100
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,440
 I think the '70s was a very rich period for this kind of stuff.

101
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,440
 So I know the film Airplane, and I love it.

102
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:10,440
 It's a great spoof. Leslie Nielsen, who previously been a serious proper actor,

103
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,440
 but just had great gravitas and played it so straight that he was great in the spoof, Airplane.

104
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:19,440
 But Airplane is based on the series of films called Airport, which were insane.

105
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,440
 They were so insane.

106
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,440
 So they had to buy the rights, didn't they?

107
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,440
 For the original script, because they were so worried.

108
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,440
 The Zazz TV.

109
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,440
 Yeah, they did.

110
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,440
 This is Zucker Abrams Zucker.

111
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,440
 They were so worried that the script was so similar that they'd get sued.

112
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,440
 So they had to ask for the rights so that they could remake the movie.

113
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,440
 Well, I can understand, because they cast some of the same people.

114
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,440
 A cabin attendant is played by a cabin attendant.

115
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,440
 He's a play-fan actor.

116
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,440
 But just listen to Airport 1975. That was film two, right?

117
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,440
 There's a small plane flying. The pilot has a heart attack.

118
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,440
 His plane crashes into a Boeing 747 full of passengers making its way along.

119
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,440
 Nightmare.

120
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,440
 The flight engineer is killed. The first officer gets sucked out of the cabin.

121
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,440
 The pilot is alive, but blinded.

122
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,440
 Okay?

123
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,440
 Nobody can fly it.

124
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,440
 So then a helicopter is dispatched, so they have to get someone from the helicopter

125
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,440
 into the plane.

126
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,440
 Into the hole.

127
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,440
 Into the hole while the plane is flying.

128
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,440
 Right.

129
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,440
 These are just good plots.

130
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,440
 It's great.

131
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,440
 Fantastic.

132
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,440
 They're just like, there are seven basic plots.

133
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,440
 This is one of them.

134
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,440
 How can you parody that?

135
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,440
 It's too great.

136
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,440
 I know.

137
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,440
 But then the fourth one, Airport 79.

138
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,440
 Wow, they've made a lot of sequels.

139
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,440
 Nice.

140
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,440
 Kong.

141
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,440
 In that one, the fourth one.

142
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,440
 And that's what the airplane came from, basically.

143
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,440
 Kong called does a loop the loop.

144
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,440
 And yeah.

145
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,440
 And it was sure.

146
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,440
 When it was shown on TV, they had to bulk it up.

147
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,940
 So they just put in 21 minutes of extra footage so it could make a three-hour slot instead

148
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:38,940
 of a two-hour slot.

149
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,440
 They just shoved in random news footage and extra stuff.

150
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,440
 Can I do a quick thing on biggest things in Britain?

151
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,440
 Yeah, go for it.

152
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,440
 Do you know where the biggest telephone box is in the UK?

153
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,440
 In the UK.

154
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,440
 And you're probably thinking, how are their different sizes?

155
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,440
 Yeah.

156
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,440
 I thought they were standard.

157
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,440
 Is this going to be a novelty?

158
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,440
 It is noticeably, and yes, another tillily to coin a word.

159
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,440
 Isn't it well-pronounced?

160
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,440
 Isn't it?

161
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,440
 Oh, that's interesting.

162
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,440
 And it's a red classic.

163
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,440
 You'd go past it and go, oh, that's a big telephone box.

164
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,440
 Definitely.

165
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,440
 Would you go past it and go, that's effing cute.

166
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,440
 That's a skyscraper.

167
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,440
 Or you'd think, huh, that looks a bit off.

168
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,440
 I'd put it to you this way.

169
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,440
 It's in, I believe, the knowledge.

170
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,440
 Oh, I know what it will be.

171
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,440
 It's going to be a gravestone.

172
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,440
 It is not.

173
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,440
 Although there is a connection to gravestones because the mausoleum, there's a mausoleum

174
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,440
 for whom the telephone box was inspired by the cap of it.

175
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,440
 Okay.

176
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,440
 Is inspired, you know this, don't you, Anna?

177
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,440
 Yes, so it's the shape of it.

178
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,440
 I can't remember whose.

179
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,440
 I forget the name, but he's actually near Henry.

180
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,440
 Huge architect.

181
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,440
 Yes, but his house is just down the road from where we are right now.

182
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,440
 Oh, wow.

183
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,440
 Anyway, moving on.

184
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,440
 It's in Maida Vale, and it's built by this industrial designer.

185
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,440
 He's a genuine, like, incredibly influential person.

186
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,440
 His name is Philippe Stark.

187
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,440
 He's built so many different things.

188
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,440
 Buildings and bridges and all the rest of it.

189
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,440
 I've recently come back from Japan where they have lots of different manhole covers

190
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,440
 that have ornate drawings on them, whether it's Pikachu or it's Pokemon.

191
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,440
 Do you see them?

192
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,440
 They're everywhere.

193
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,440
 That's so cool.

194
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,440
 And they're so popular that they sell them.

195
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,440
 You've probably mentioned this already.

196
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,440
 But whilst I was there, I also noticed this building in the middle of Tokyo,

197
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,440
 which is in the shape of a beer.

198
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,440
 And it is the Asahi Brewery building, and he designed that.

199
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,440
 And it's gold, very nearly to the top, and then a white head.

200
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,440
 That is his thing.

201
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,440
 Fantastic.

202
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,440
 And you also have just the left of the building, depending of where you're obviously standing.

203
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,440
 There is another sort of sub-building where he has a golden flame.

204
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,440
 Unfortunately, Japan thinks the flame looks a bit like a poo,

205
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,440
 so it's called, in Japanese, the golden poo.

206
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,440
 Cool.

207
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,440
 So this guy designed that, but he also designed the double-decker telephone box,

208
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,440
 where he took two and put one on top of another, welded them together,

209
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,440
 and then made it look like a sort of 1930s-era Bakelite phone.

210
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,440
 It's there, it's a tourist attraction.

211
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,440
 What's two telephone boxes that look like a telephone?

212
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,440
 It's two telephone boxes that look like a giant upward telephone box.

213
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,440
 Cool.

214
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,440
 Can you climb up to the upper one?

215
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,440
 It's not so high.

216
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,440
 But it's sort of you stand next to it and you'd look short.

217
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,440
 If someone's using the one on the bottom level,

218
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,440
 do you have to climb over onto their shoulders to get to the top one?

219
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,440
 It's only double-decker in height.

220
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,440
 Inside, it just has the one phone.

221
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,440
 Oh, it's the phone at the top.

222
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,440
 Anna, you've got the job on Microsoft.

223
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,440
 You asked the right questions.

224
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,440
 You've double-checked the nonsense that was coming out of my mouth.

225
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,440
 But yes, it's in Mail of Ale.

226
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,440
 It's quite close to the tube station.

227
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,440
 If you're curious, I certainly was.

228
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,440
 I went to see it.

229
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,440
 It is very tall.

230
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,440
 Do you know what's so cool about that as well?

231
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,440
 He lives in Made of Ale,

232
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,440
 and he built something that's made of ale.

233
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,440
 Very cool.

234
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,440
 Very nice.

235
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,440
 Incredible nonsense.

236
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,440
 Thank you for indulging me.

237
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,440
 Here's a quiz question then as well.

238
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,440
 You're living in Oslo, and suddenly in your city,

239
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,440
 they are welding all of your manhole covers shut,

240
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,440
 or 400, at least, that you know of.

241
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,440
 That you know of.

242
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,440
 A well-welded shut.

243
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,440
 Most people can only name 400 or 500 manholes.

244
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,440
 So let's say 2010, something like that.

245
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,440
 Wow.

246
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,440
 Okay.

247
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,440
 Why?

248
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,440
 What's going on?

249
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,440
 Criminal activity.

250
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,440
 This is where I lose the job at Microsoft.

251
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,440
 Sue a crime.

252
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,440
 What's it?

253
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,440
 Trapping the mint.

254
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,440
 Trapping the mint.

255
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,440
 Trapping the mint.

256
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,440
 I've got it.

257
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,440
 The turtles.

258
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,440
 Yes.

259
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,440
 That's it.

260
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,440
 Beyond what that is.

261
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,440
 They're trapping them inside.

262
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,440
 Yes.

263
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,440
 Till they starve.

264
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,440
 Cut off the pizza supplies.

265
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,440
 That's it.

266
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,440
 The turtles will be ours in a week.

267
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,440
 There we go.

268
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,440
 That's why manhole covers around,

269
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,440
 because it's a shape of a pizza.

270
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,440
 You've got the job.

271
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,440
 Oh, my God.

272
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,440
 You guys are going to hate me.

273
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,440
 I haven't written down the answer.

274
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,440
 No, I'm joking.

275
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,440
 Of course.

276
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,440
 So the answer is, if you're in Oslo,

277
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,440
 around that period of time,

278
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,440
 because if you see that happening,

279
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,440
 it means the American president is coming to town,

280
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,440
 because when the president comes,

281
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,440
 and so this happened at presidential inaugurations,

282
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,440
 this happens when they do big public speeches,

283
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,440
 they seal up all the manholes.

284
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,440
 In case he falls in.

285
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,440
 In case there would be assassins,

286
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,440
 we'll leave a bomb underneath.

287
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,440
 Or maybe not underneath.

288
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,440
 That's embarrassing for a president.

289
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,440
 14 presidents have died falling into manholes.

290
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,440
 The president and the vice president,

291
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,440
 they're carrying that giant plane of glass

292
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,440
 across the...

293
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,440
 And that's a problem.

294
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,440
 It is.

295
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,440
 All the rakes have to be tidied up,

296
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,440
 the loose-around tab.

297
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,440
 Super long thanks being carried by one person.

298
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,440
 Not allowed in his vicinity.

299
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,440
 I just...

300
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,440
 Can I raise a hand here of skepticism?

301
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,440
 I'm writing the hand of skepticism,

302
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,440
 and I'm saying, I'd be astonished

303
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,440
 if every time the president came to visit London,

304
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,440
 which I know he hasn't done for a while,

305
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,440
 because he doesn't give a shit,

306
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,440
 but we sealed up, we welded up all the farm manholes,

307
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,440
 and then someone had to come unweld them

308
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,440
 as soon as he'd gone.

309
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,440
 So it's not everywhere they go.

310
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,440
 It's not like there's maintenance workers

311
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,440
 running ahead of the black limo of the beast.

312
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,440
 But it's for big events, that happens.

313
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,440
 They do do that.

314
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,440
 That's very cool.

315
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,440
 Yeah, that's great.

316
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,440
 I really want to tell a very boring fact now.

317
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,440
 Go, go.

318
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,440
 You know the difference between a typeface and a font, right?

319
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,440
 Oh, God, who doesn't?

320
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,440
 Who doesn't, obviously.

321
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,440
 Yeah.

322
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,440
 But I want to ask you guys as professional factors,

323
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,440
 are there facts which are so known

324
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,440
 that if someone tells them to you at a party,

325
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,440
 you're like, yeah, we know that one.

326
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,440
 We get it.

327
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,440
 That's basically you're in my relationship, Ally.

328
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,440
 I think it is.

329
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,440
 You keep telling me things.

330
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,440
 I tell you things to go, yes, I'm aware

331
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,440
 that there are apples and apple pies.

332
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,440
 Yes, very good, Ally, very good.

333
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,440
 But that, why ampersands are called ampersands?

334
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,440
 Is that like a universally known thing for you guys?

335
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,440
 I don't know.

336
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,440
 Tell us.

337
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,440
 Okay, here we go.

338
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,440
 The reason why an ampersand is called an ampersand

339
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,440
 is because it's actually a contraction of the phrase

340
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,440
 and, per se, and, right?

341
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,440
 So it is as quirky as that.

342
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,440
 It's a bit weird.

343
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,440
 So the original ampersand, which you know,

344
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,440
 the one you know well now is sort of a big loop

345
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,440
 and then it goes up and around and through.

346
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,440
 But it's actually sort of squishing together of ET.

347
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,440
 An et-bing and, in Latin.

348
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,440
 There it is.

349
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,440
 So the name is a corruption of and, per se, and,

350
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,440
 i.e. it's and, and by itself, it also means and.

351
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,440
 I know this looks and sounds weird,

352
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,440
 but it's from Scribes, writing in Latin.

353
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,440
 That's cool.

354
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,440
 And when you write it in an italic version,

355
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,440
 it sort of pushes them together

356
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,440
 and that's why it is called an ampersand.

357
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,440
 Right.

358
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,440
 I could have told that story better,

359
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,440
 but I promise you it's interesting.

360
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,440
 Are you trying to get your word count up?

361
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,440
 I'm Dr. Spetchenin, the king of spacemans.

362
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,440
 But speaking of space and also printing and also journalism,

363
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,440
 Futura is the font that's in space.

364
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,440
 Okay.

365
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,440
 So bear with me here.

366
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,440
 A typographer, I believe that's the right term,

367
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,440
 called Paul Renner created the font, the typeface.

368
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,440
 I know there's a difference.

369
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,440
 Called Futura in 1927 and it was used by NASA

370
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,440
 for when they put the plaque on the moon.

371
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,440
 That's great.

372
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,440
 And it's called Futura.

373
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,440
 That's so good, isn't it?

374
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,440
 Very cool.

375
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,440
 I didn't know that.

376
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,440
 And it's one of the most copied fonts typefaces.

377
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,440
 Everywhere.

378
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,440
 I'm sorry, what is the difference?

379
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,440
 I don't know the difference.

380
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,440
 Yeah.

381
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,440
 Okay, here we go.

382
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,440
 Turn left, have another day.

383
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,440
 A typeface is not a font.

384
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,440
 Each variation of a typeface, bold, italicized, underlined,

385
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,440
 is called a font.

386
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,440
 But the typeface itself is what you're sort of more or less

387
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,440
 referring to.

388
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,440
 Yes, right.

389
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,440
 So Helvetica is a typeface, but it's font, italicized,

390
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,440
 underlined, bold.

391
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,440
 But the trouble is is that in America, it's sort of interchangeable

392
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,440
 and it doesn't matter so much.

393
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,440
 And I think the prevalence of...

394
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,440
 Unlike here where if you use one rather than the other,

395
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,440
 you're out the window.

396
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,440
 You've lost your job at Amstrad.

397
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,440
 Sorry.

398
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,440
 Get out the window.

399
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,440
 No, it's just...

400
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,440
 Font is a set of type that is one particular face and size.

401
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,440
 That has...

402
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,440
 I have to say, I'm pretty sure Alex Brothers told me that

403
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,440
 1900 times and I've never remembered it when he has, so...

404
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,440
 I forgot it just as I said it.

405
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,440
 Yeah, so typeface is the original and then the variations of fonts.

406
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,440
 Correct.

407
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,440
 That's great.

408
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,440
 That's great.

409
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,440
 For Turo, every font must have a little story like that.

410
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,440
 I didn't know that Times New Roman was invented for the

411
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,440
 Times newspaper in the UK.

412
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,440
 Like, that's specifically for them.

413
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,440
 That's pretty cool.

414
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,440
 Helvetica, Switzerland, the old word for Switzerland,

415
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,440
 that's why it's called that.

416
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,440
 There's also a documentary on the typeface of Helvetica,

417
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,440
 called Helvetica, I highly recommend it.

418
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,440
 And you were saying my sewage tracks were boring.

419
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,440
 I know.

420
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,440
 They are so unfair.

421
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:19,440
 But yeah, I know what you mean about this spider not being

422
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,440
 a qualified vampire because of size.

423
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,440
 I think that jumping spiders, of which this is the type,

424
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,440
 are just cheating quite a lot because you always see photos

425
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,440
 of them and they are quite beautiful looking.

426
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,440
 And there's like a peacock one, which is particularly nice.

427
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,440
 And you always forget in photos, they're heavily zoomed.

428
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,440
 So I actually just want everyone to remember when you see

429
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,440
 a picture of a jumping spider that looks great,

430
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,440
 they're all only a millimeter or two, aren't they?

431
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,440
 So what?

432
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,440
 They're still lovely.

433
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,440
 It doesn't count.

434
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,440
 It doesn't count.

435
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,440
 But they are amazing.

436
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,440
 Something we haven't mentioned about jumping spiders before

437
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,440
 is that they have REM sleep.

438
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,440
 And I just like the way that they learn this.

439
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,440
 So when they are newborns for the first 10 days,

440
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,440
 they don't have any pigment on their exoskeleton,

441
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,440
 which means you can see straight through them.

442
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,440
 And also they've got huge eyes.

443
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,440
 So the way they tested this to find out if they have REM sleep

444
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,440
 is they got baby spiders.

445
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,440
 So you can see through their heads into their eyeballs,

446
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,440
 which are massive.

447
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,440
 And then they just watch their eyeballs.

448
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,440
 And there was a scientist, Daniela Rusler,

449
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,440
 who held up a magnifying glass and got a night vision camera,

450
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,440
 watch the spiders sleeping.

451
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,440
 And you could literally see the spinnerettes,

452
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,440
 which are the organs that make silk,

453
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,440
 going insane suddenly with their eyes vibrating at the same time,

454
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,440
 showing their sort of practicing for making webs.

455
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,440
 Amazing.

456
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,440
 So they're dreaming, basically.

457
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,440
 They're dreaming.

458
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,440
 And sometimes they would suddenly, all of their limbs would

459
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,440
 flail out as if they're going, oh my god.

460
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,440
 Wow.

461
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,440
 Yeah, it's definitely like a dog sleeping.

462
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,440
 They do.

463
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,440
 Yeah.

464
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,440
 So they do have dream.

465
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,440
 It's possibly my favorite fact that I've certainly said on this

466
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,440
 show in the 10 years, which is that octopuses,

467
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,440
 we don't know if they have REM sleep,

468
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,440
 but there's one example where it might have shown that they are dreaming,

469
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,440
 because you only dream once you're in REM sleep, right?

470
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,440
 Is that they were observing an octopus,

471
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,440
 and it suddenly camouflage changed to something else

472
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,440
 while it was sleeping and then back again,

473
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,440
 as if it was scared by whatever it needed to hide from in a nightmare.

474
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,440
 Yeah.

475
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,440
 Isn't that awesome?

476
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,440
 But we don't know.

477
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,440
 We just don't know yet if that was a random thing

478
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,440
 or if that was a dream.

479
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,440
 I love that your favorite fact is we don't know.

480
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,440
 Yes.

481
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,440
 Yeah.

482
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,440
 Those are always my favorite.

483
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,440
 Here, Dan.

484
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,440
 By the way, I love that the--

485
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,440
 If I was writing a script of this spider, right?

486
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,440
 Mm-hmm.

487
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,440
 I'd sort of say it's creepy enough.

488
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,440
 You've got the creep factor.

489
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,440
 We're already scared.

490
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,440
 We don't need to see through stuff.

491
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,440
 Come on.

492
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,440
 And then the flailing legs.

493
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,440
 The REM, like, it's sort of a town hat, you know?

494
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,440
 Yeah.

495
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,440
 We're already freaked out by it.

496
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,440
 Imagine if you could see into your baby.

497
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,440
 No.

498
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,440
 Your baby when it was born.

499
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,440
 Seeing into your baby.

500
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,440
 It's cool.

501
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,440
 It looks just like your father.

502
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,440
 Because they've--

503
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,440
 Because they're behind the baby.

504
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,440
 He's got your mother's liver.

505
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,440
 Hey, here's a surprising thing.

506
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,440
 The three of us, me, Andy and James,

507
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,440
 we're in Belgium recently.

508
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,440
 I didn't realize.

509
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,440
 You know, every time we go to Belgium, there's things like,

510
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,440
 "Oh, a monk beer," and all this stuff that they're so proud of.

511
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,440
 Not the single person has said,

512
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,440
 "Hey, welcome to the homeland of billiard balls,"

513
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,440
 to where 80% of all billiard balls that are used by professionals

514
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,440
 are manufactured.

515
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,440
 They are the great makers of billiard balls.

516
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,440
 And they had the world champion sneaker player last year.

517
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,440
 Did they?

518
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,440
 Yeah, Luca Bracel.

519
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,440
 Well, when you've got that many balls to play with,

520
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,440
 it's cheating.

521
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,440
 It is cheating.

522
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,440
 Yeah.

523
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,440
 Hands never out of his pockets.

524
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,440
 That's amazing.

525
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,440
 They don't know how to sell themselves is what you're saying.

526
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,440
 They're always wanging on about their chocolate and their beer,

527
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,440
 but focus on the billiard balls.

528
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,440
 That is amazing.

529
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,440
 You've got Tin Tin at the station.

530
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,440
 I didn't see a single billiard ball

531
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,440
 when I was getting on the Eurostar.

532
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,440
 Crazy.

533
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:42,440
 You know that huge atomium that they have in Brussels?

534
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,440
 They claim that that's an atom, but actually it's billiard balls.

535
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,440
 That's a billiard ball.

536
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,440
 Oh, my God.

537
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,440
 Well, the world centre of cue making is Paris,

538
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:54,440
 which is a man called John Paris who lives in south London.

539
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,440
 Very nice.

540
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,440
 He lives in Forest Hill.

541
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,440
 And there are queues outside the shop every day.

542
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,440
 Brilliant.

543
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,440
 Brilliant.

544
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,440
 Before he brings them in to salvage them.

545
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,440
 About half of professionals have had queues made by him.

546
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,440
 Really?

547
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,440
 In his workshop.

548
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,440
 He's a vander.

549
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,440
 He is.

550
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,440
 Actually.

551
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,440
 The Harry Potter wizard wand merchant seller.

552
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,440
 That's it.

553
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,440
 Yes, because you have very specific queue desires, don't you?

554
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,440
 If you're a professional, make a player.

555
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,440
 Are you allowed to make a really, really long queue?

556
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,440
 There are probably rules on there.

557
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,440
 There's probably restrictions.

558
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,440
 I think you are, but it's not useful.

559
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,440
 Because you can't make a really, really long arm.

560
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,440
 Yeah.

561
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,440
 But it would be cool if you could stay in your...

562
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,440
 If you could win from your dressing room.

563
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:45,440
 Because a billiards table is so big, quite often you can't really reach the ball.

564
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,440
 So you can make extensions on your queue to make it longer and longer and longer.

565
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:56,440
 But to be the most efficient snookering technique, you really want one about the same size as your arm.

566
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,440
 That would be good though.

567
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,440
 There's one mysterious snooker player that no one's ever seen.

568
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,440
 But it's his term of stick.

569
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,440
 Slowly comes Mr. Tickle.

570
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,440
 Blacksmithing, obviously the original metal shaping, was often dog powered.

571
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,440
 And this is until the 20th century.

572
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,440
 I found a picture from the 1930s.

573
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,440
 A video from the 1930s with the dog powered one.

574
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:27,440
 So I imagine a blacksmith gets a piece of metal, puts it in the fire till it's really hot,

575
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,440
 puts it on his anvil and hits it with a hammer.

576
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,440
 But I don't see where the dog could come in there.

577
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,440
 Yes, it's in that first bit.

578
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,440
 So the fire needs to stay hot.

579
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,440
 So you've got those bellows that keep the fire super hot.

580
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:43,440
 And you would often employ a little boy, because you had to pay them less to operate the bellows.

581
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:49,440
 Or they would have a wheel in the corner with a dog, a very obedient dog, just running around around the wheel.

582
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,440
 And that wheel would be connected to a series of pulleys that operated the bellows.

583
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,440
 It's bellows.

584
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,440
 Yeah, I know.

585
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,440
 It always seemed to be a bit of a novelty.

586
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:06,440
 And he mentioned of it in history is, oh, there's a clever blacksmith in, you know, British Columbia who's got a dog operating the wheel.

587
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:10,440
 I feel like that used to be a dog job back in the day for multiple different things.

588
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,440
 Yes.

589
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,440
 Turned bent dogs.

590
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,440
 Exactly, yeah.

591
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,440
 Which we should say is where you turn meat using a dog.

592
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,440
 Yeah, the rotisserie chicken is turned via...

593
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,440
 They still use that in Tescos, don't they?

594
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,440
 Yeah.

595
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,440
 Amazing, the RSPCA hasn't gone on to them yet.

596
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,440
 They like it.

597
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,440
 If you heat up metal really, really, really, really high.

598
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,440
 As high as you can possibly imagine.

599
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,440
 Yeah.

600
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:39,440
 It acts almost exactly the same as how mayonnaise acts at quite low temperatures.

601
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,440
 You can spread it on toast.

602
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:49,440
 It's the way that it kind of flows, the way that you would, like if it's really cold mayonnaise, you won't be able to spread it.

603
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,440
 Do you mean at normal temperature mayonnaise?

604
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,440
 Cold temperature mayonnaise, but not freezing, but just ultra cold.

605
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,440
 Okay.

606
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,440
 Yeah, so those two things are basically identical for physicists.

607
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:05,440
 Which means that if you're ever trying something out and you need to work out what the metal's going to do at high temperatures,

608
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,440
 like for fusion reactions or whatever, you can use mayonnaise instead.

609
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,440
 Oh, really?

610
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,440
 It can just cool down some helmets a little bit.

611
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,440
 And it'll give you exactly the same conditions as a molten metal.

612
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,440
 That's crazy.

613
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,440
 Wouldn't the molten, oh so the molten metal, so it has melted at this point.

614
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,440
 So imagine you've kind of melted your metal.

615
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:27,440
 It's kind of rolling down like maybe lava or something down a slope.

616
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,440
 And you want to know what's exactly is going to happen.

617
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,440
 You can just cool down some mayonnaise till just before it's going to freeze and pour the mayonnaise.

618
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,440
 Hellman's is almost the perfect name for molten lava.

619
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,440
 Hellman.

620
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,440
 And do they do this?

621
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,440
 Is it like you'll get physicists who buy up 20 jars of mayonnaise for the next experiment?

622
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:50,440
 Yes, there is a group of physicists who are doing that right now.

623
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,440
 Cool.

624
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,440
 During lockdown, that's why we were all in the toilet paper section,

625
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,440
 but physicists were just clawing through the mayonnaise area.

626
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,440
 Wow, that's very cool.

627
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,440
 That is incredible.

628
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,440
 Did you see about moss in space as an actual moss in space?

629
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,440
 No, this is like ISS stuff.

630
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,440
 It was, was it at the ISS?

631
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,440
 Oh gosh, no.

632
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:16,440
 So this was on the Space Shuttle Columbia missions.

633
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:20,440
 And they grew moss on those missions.

634
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:24,440
 And they found really interestingly that it grew in a spiral.

635
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:29,440
 Because what you would think is, OK, if moss grows in a direction due to gravity,

636
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,440
 then that's one thing.

637
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,440
 And when you go in space where there's no gravity,

638
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,440
 it'll just go in random filaments and random orders and you wouldn't know why.

639
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,440
 But actually it goes into spirals and we don't know why.

640
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,440
 Interesting.

641
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,440
 Cool.

642
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,440
 Because it's pretty, you know?

643
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,440
 Moss has got a sense of the aesthetic, hasn't it?

644
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,440
 Something fractal, probably something fractal.

645
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:53,440
 Alright, dude, have another toke.

646
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,440
 Here's a cool thing.

647
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,440
 This is amazing.

648
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:00,440
 Right, so every second, the Sun gets four billion kilos lighter

649
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,440
 because it's eaten up that much matter.

650
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,440
 How interesting.

651
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,440
 It eats stuff and gets lighter.

652
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,440
 If only we could crack this.

653
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,440
 Oh, weird.

654
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,440
 I've been staring at this thing for three days now.

655
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,440
 [LAUGHTER]

656
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,440
 But despite that, four billion kilos every second, that's so much.

657
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,440
 That's a lot.

658
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,440
 It's a big diet.

659
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,440
 It's a big thing, isn't it?

660
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,440
 That's it.

661
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,440
 In its lifetime, it's converted 100 Earth's worth of mass into energy.

662
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,440
 OK.

663
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,440
 But that is just three thousandths of its total mass that it's used up so far.

664
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,440
 So it is going to last a very, very, very, very long time.

665
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,440
 Even longer than that heavy press machine.

666
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,440
 Right, exactly.

667
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,440
 But I found this amazing calculation on a physics website.

668
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,440
 OK, so if we captured-- have you heard of a Dyson sphere, right?

669
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,440
 Yep.

670
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,440
 It's where you basically harvest all the energy of a star.

671
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,440
 You basically put a load of solar panels all the way around the Sun.

672
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,440
 Yeah, you wrap them.

673
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,440
 And so like literally no light can escape from it.

674
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,440
 So you're getting perfect, almost perfect amount of light.

675
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,440
 Exactly.

676
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,440
 So you can use that energy for something.

677
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,440
 Yeah.

678
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,440
 And so it's proposed by Freeman J. Dyson.

679
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,440
 And he said we should be looking for these things.

680
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,440
 Not we should be building one, but we should look for one,

681
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,440
 because that'll probably be evidence of an alien civilization.

682
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:21,440
 Yeah, they reckon that eventually, if you're advanced enough,

683
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,440
 you will build one of these.

684
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,440
 Right.

685
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,440
 Eventually we will, and eventually some other people must have done.

686
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,440
 Sorry, such a cool idea.

687
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,440
 So OK, here's the question.

688
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,440
 If we captured all of our Sun's energy for just one second,

689
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,440
 Yeah.

690
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,440
 how long would we be able to power human civilization for, right?

691
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,440
 OK.

692
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,440
 Oh, OK.

693
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,440
 What's the total usage of electricity and energy?

694
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,440
 So we do use a lot of energy on Earth, I've read.

695
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,440
 Sure.

696
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,440
 Like for Bitcoin mining and stuff.

697
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,440
 Yeah.

698
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,440
 There are a lot of solar panels now as well.

699
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,440
 Yeah.

700
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,440
 Oh, yeah.

701
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,440
 And that is only a tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny proportion of Earth

702
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,440
 even now that is covered inside the panels, right?

703
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,440
 So how long, sorry, say the question one more time.

704
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,440
 So it's all of the Sun's energy in total for one second.

705
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,440
 Yeah.

706
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,440
 How long could we power human civilization?

707
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,440
 Roughly the current rate of usage.

708
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,440
 150,000 years.

709
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,440
 Oh, wow.

710
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,440
 Wow, sis.

711
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,440
 I was going to give more like 3,000 years.

712
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,440
 Yeah, I was going for like since the birth of Jesus, so 2,000 years.

713
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,440
 OK.

714
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,440
 150,000 feels like it might be ruining Andy's fact.

715
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,440
 You've done the old overshoot the fact and now...

716
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,440
 Sorry, three months, Andy.

717
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,440
 Don't invite me to a party.

718
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,440
 This is based on world energy consumption in 2018.

719
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,440
 And it assumes that you only capture it at 20% efficiency.

720
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,440
 So solar panels these days can do kind of 25-ish.

721
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,440
 I mean, good solar panels, right?

722
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,440
 If you, even if you only got it at 20% efficiency,

723
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,440
 if you got all of the Sun's energy for one second,

724
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:42,440
 you could power Earth for 953,000 years.

725
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,440
 Oh, undershot it, then.

726
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,440
 Yeah, apologies.

727
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,440
 It's Anna, even before you say it.

728
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:52,440
 It's unbelievable how much free energy

729
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,440
 just comes from the Sun.

730
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,440
 That is amazing.

731
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,440
 But I was doing your favor there by making Dan's guests sound huge,

732
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,440
 so yours would sound even huge.

733
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,440
 Thank you.

734
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,440
 Wow, thank you.

735
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,440
 Yeah, three months.

736
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,440
 Idiot.

737
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,440
 (LAUGHTER)

738
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,440
 In India, you were mentioning at the beginning, Andy,

739
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,440
 that, you know, who has different handwriting these days

740
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,440
 in the way that James is mentioning, and doctors was one of them.

741
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,440
 And in India, there was a thing that became official in 2012,

742
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,440
 which is that handwriting had to become legible from doctors

743
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,440
 and either had to be written in block letters

744
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,440
 or just had to be really clear,

745
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,440
 because they were finding that there were so many deaths

746
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,440
 or quite ill people off the back of handwriting

747
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,440
 being misunderstood when the pharmacist

748
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,440
 is giving out the prescription.

749
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,440
 And there were so many drugs that are just one letter different

750
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,440
 that might have the counter effect that you want

751
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,440
 for what you actually prescribed.

752
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,440
 And so, yeah, and so they've actually passed that.

753
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,440
 And so doctors have had to change this weird,

754
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,440
 crazy, unreadable...

755
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,440
 It was like hypertension or hypotension.

756
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,440
 Oh, yeah.

757
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,440
 That's a good one.

758
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,440
 If you get one or the other, you're buggered, aren't you?

759
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,440
 Yeah, exactly.

760
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,440
 And there are cases, although you do read some wild claims online

761
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,440
 about sort of, you know, 20 million deaths a day,

762
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,440
 of course, by doctors' handwriting, but it is quite valid.

763
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,440
 I read 7,000, but yeah, 20 million.

764
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,440
 Yeah, I think.

765
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,440
 It's actually 27 and 20 million, yeah.

766
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,440
 I don't think it's even that much, but...

767
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,440
 The problem was that the study was written by...

768
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,440
 That's how it is said.

769
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:24,440
 I think it is true that it uses up so much time.

770
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:27,440
 So there was an estimate by the Institute

771
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,440
 for safe medication practices that in decipherable prescriptions,

772
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,440
 largely because of bad handwriting,

773
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,440
 result in 150 million calls in America alone...

774
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,440
 What?

775
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,440
 ...from pharmacists to doctors a year,

776
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,440
 which is that's the amount of time that's being used up on...

777
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,440
 That's stunning.

778
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,440
 Isn't that incredible?

779
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,440
 So that's, you know, many, many millions of dollars wasted.

780
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,440
 That is a case of just typing it out.

781
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,440
 Yeah, and I think we're getting more closer and closer to everyone

782
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,440
 just putting stuff.

783
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,440
 It's a nice rom-com as well, you know,

784
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,440
 a pharmacist having to call the same doctor each time

785
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,440
 to sort of chat, "Which did you mean?"

786
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,440
 And then he falls in love with her,

787
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,440
 so he's purposefully giving the wrong spelling on stuff.

788
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,440
 Was this Viagra or Viagra?

789
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:14,440
 All right, there we go.

790
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,440
 That is all of our outtakes.

791
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,440
 If you would like to get in contact with any of us

792
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:21,440
 about the things that were said over the course of these clips,

793
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,440
 you can get us on our social media accounts.

794
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,440
 You can get us generally at podcast@qi.com

795
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,440
 if you want to send an email in.

796
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,440
 Maybe that email will be read out on a future Drop Us a Line.

797
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,440
 So do send them in.

798
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,440
 And also, remember what I said at the top of the show,

799
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,440
 we are doing a really fun, silly live night.

800
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,440
 It's going to be a fish recording, a full episode,

801
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,440
 with lots of new bits chucked in between

802
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,440
 for us to test out ahead of our Thunder Nerds tour.

803
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,440
 If you want to come and see us do that,

804
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,440
 it's going to be at the Underbelly Boulevard Soho London,

805
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,440
 7pm on Monday, the 12th of August.

806
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,440
 Tickets are available now,

807
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,440
 and we can't wait to get on stage

808
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,440
 and test out all of these ideas we've been having.

809
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,440
 So you'll see a lot of stuff that won't make it into the final tour,

810
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,440
 or even if you're coming into the tour,

811
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,440
 you'll see something right at the start

812
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,440
 that will have evolved into something very different by the end.

813
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,440
 It will be a really fun night, so yeah, get your tickets now.

814
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,440
 Otherwise, come back in a couple of weeks.

815
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,440
 We're going to have another Drop Us a Line, more compilations.

816
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,440
 We will see you then. Goodbye.

817
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:19,020
 (upbeat music)

818
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,600
 (upbeat music)
