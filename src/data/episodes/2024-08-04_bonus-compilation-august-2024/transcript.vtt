00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.460
 Hey, Clubfish members! Dan here. Welcome to your bonus bit of content for this week.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:11.540
 We've got a compilation for you. But before I get into that, I want to quickly announce

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:17.320
 a very exciting thing. We're putting on a last minute live show in London on the 12th

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.880
 of August at 7pm. So that's this coming Monday. It's going to be at the Underbelly Boulevard,

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:29.160
 which is in Soho. It's an amazing venue. We're going to be recording a live episode and we're

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.520
 going to be testing out a lot of fun, silly things. This is a show that is a warm-up in

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.640
 lead-up to our tour. We've come up with a bunch of ideas. We're going to be doing them

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.760
 throughout the night. It's going to be fun as hell. It's going to be silly as shit. It's

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.680
 going to be wonderful. So if you want to come along, do get yourself a ticket. It's not

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.200
 the biggest of venues, so tickets will fly out quick. You can do that by heading to the

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.960
 Underbelly Boulevard website, underbellyboulvard.com, and you can get your tickets there. The show

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.200
 starts at 7pm, Monday, August 12th. Okay, let's get into this compilation. You're

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.200
 going to hear a few voices that aren't the regular fishes in here. These are the outtakes

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.160
 that were grabbed from the full-episode recordings and you'll be hearing from two amazing guests.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:19.240
 We have Marine biologist Helen Scales and then BBC Radio's film critic Ali Plumb. It's

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:34.960
 a great app, so let's get on with it. On with the compilation.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:59.480
 I think Ali Plumb can sleep well at night. No, I think I've seen the trailer, but I'm

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.120
 interested in it because it's George Miller who made Mad Max, you know. Of course it is,

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:10.400
 but I'm just thinking about the similar themes because it's an extreme environment. Yeah,

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:19.560
 end of the world is nigh. Are there any flamethrowers in Happy Feet? Again, I don't know, but you've

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:26.040
 got a penguin who can't sing, but he can dance. And in Mad Max, you've got a road warrior

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:32.880
 who is not mentally very well, but he is very good at road war. Is this what you're

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.960
 talking about? This is why you've raised us, is to do the comparison between Happy Feet,

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.840
 which you haven't seen, and Mad Max, which you have. Yeah. I feel like I've seen Mad

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.440
 Max so many times that it sort of makes up for never seeing Happy Feet. You need to find

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.720
 the person who's seen Happy Feet and not Mad Max, and then you guys can get together

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.800
 and have a good old chat. Can I throw one more thing in about penguins? We can always just

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.360
 cut this bit out, but I just really love this fact, is how they evolved. So about 20 million

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.040
 years ago, penguins, as we know them, there were some ones before that, which were really

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.280
 big and we'll just leave them to one side for now. But penguins, we know of them, started

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.960
 about 20 million years ago on islands near New Zealand. And basically, there's like this

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.880
 big strong current that spins around Antarctica, which is one of the reasons why it's really

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.840
 cold, because it just goes round and round and then the warm water from everywhere else

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.880
 doesn't get into Antarctica. The southern ocean just gets colder and colder. And basically,

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.040
 penguins rode that current around the continent and evolved into different species as they

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.640
 evolved. So they went from the islands, they came down to Antarctica. The first ones to

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.120
 evolve were the big ones, the emperor penguins and the king penguins, which are the big,

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.280
 tall ones. They kind of became more and more adapted to these cold conditions as they went

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:44.600
 and evolved into other things, like cadaloupe penguins and chinstrap. Then a bit more recently,

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:50.480
 like about 11 million years ago, this current strengthened. And can you guess what happened

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.320
 next? So basically, the penguins then just pinged off to other parts of the ocean, riding

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.680
 this stronger current and went off to South America, went off to South Africa and to all

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.520
 the other places where you see them now. So they started Antarctica, evolved there, spun

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.760
 around the continent on this current and then basically like did a sort of slingshot, we

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.760
 think off to the other bits.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.240
 Because they're all southern hemisphere aren't they?

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.640
 They're all southern hemisphere. They don't go beyond the equator. So the Galapagos Islands

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:21.040
 is the furthest north and that's really because it's got that cold current anyway. And well,

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.480
 we could talk about where there were no penguins in the North Pole, but they just didn't really

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.080
 get there. And I think it didn't go far enough, but I just love this idea of them raiding the

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.200
 current and then coming all the way back around and going, my God, you've changed 100 million

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.200
 years ago. Jesus.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.360
 No, so this is the thing. This was the thing that used to happen. It happened in Scotland

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.560
 and in the USA as well in the 19th century, you would just put your wedding presents on

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:53.520
 display. And it was a normal thing to go to the house and see what had been given.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.040
 A little gallery. You were in a museum pretty much. Because it incentivises the gift givers

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.560
 to give you something good, which is nice.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.560
 Yeah.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.560
 The names on them. This is from Aunty Maudry.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.560
 Thinking names are removed actually. When you go around, you can say, yeah, I actually

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.040
 gave them. I gave them that big one there and got that one tea spoon.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.040
 It's like a secret santa.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.440
 But sometimes they would include the bride's trousseau as part of the display.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.440
 What's a trousseau?

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.440
 You know, happy things you don't want to.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.440
 Well, undercrackers basically. Trousseau is a trousseau.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.440
 Sounds a bit more substantial.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.440
 It's rarely a song.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.440
 No, it won't be undergarments. It will be silken.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.440
 A picture of them being sort of petticoate sort of things.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.440
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because they were high quality things that you would get given as part of a

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.440
 wedding, you know, almost similar to a dowry, I suppose.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.440
 I think our grandparents' generation sort of did this as well. I'm sure that it was

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.440
 still about the 1940s or '50s, that it was sort of you'd have like a tea party where

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.440
 people would come and look at your wedding gifts. And I think you could put, if you got a check,

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.440
 you'd put the check on display. That's there. You'd cross out the name, like you say.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.440
 But, you know. That'd be amazing.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.440
 That's me. That's my 10 grand there.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.440
 Then I think like these days you don't get those big novelty checks as much as you used to.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.440
 I was thinking about that the other day actually.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.440
 Yeah, I was. I was like, do we still have them? And could you still walk into a bank with a

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.440
 massive novelty check? Because these days they're like, we don't take checks, do they?

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.440
 No one takes checks.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.440
 That's the saddest part of like the 21st century, I think.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.440
 Yeah, I think we've lost.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.440
 You have to go with your massive debit card.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.440
 A massive Bitcoin.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.440
 Think another huge machine for the bank.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.440
 By the way, one last spoof name that I love, if you haven't seen this film, it's called

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:39.440
 Murder by Death. And it is a pastiche of all of your favourite detectives.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.440
 It's got Nick and Nora. It's got every who done it basically.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.440
 Poirot, Marple, Charlie Chan, the whole thing.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.440
 But the name Murder by Death, I adore it.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.440
 You must watch this movie. If you enjoy Knives Out and all of that stuff.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.440
 It's a real gem. 1976.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.440
 So it's good beyond the name.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.440
 Correct.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.440
 From this.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.440
 Enough of a joke. Move on. Who needs cinema?

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.440
 I think the '70s was a very rich period for this kind of stuff.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.440
 So I know the film Airplane, and I love it.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:10.440
 It's a great spoof. Leslie Nielsen, who previously been a serious proper actor,

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.440
 but just had great gravitas and played it so straight that he was great in the spoof, Airplane.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:19.440
 But Airplane is based on the series of films called Airport, which were insane.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.440
 They were so insane.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.440
 So they had to buy the rights, didn't they?

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.440
 For the original script, because they were so worried.

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:25.440
 The Zazz TV.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:26.440
 Yeah, they did.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.440
 This is Zucker Abrams Zucker.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:31.440
 They were so worried that the script was so similar that they'd get sued.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.440
 So they had to ask for the rights so that they could remake the movie.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.440
 Well, I can understand, because they cast some of the same people.

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.440
 A cabin attendant is played by a cabin attendant.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:40.440
 He's a play-fan actor.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:44.440
 But just listen to Airport 1975. That was film two, right?

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.440
 There's a small plane flying. The pilot has a heart attack.

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:51.440
 His plane crashes into a Boeing 747 full of passengers making its way along.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.440
 Nightmare.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.440
 The flight engineer is killed. The first officer gets sucked out of the cabin.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.440
 The pilot is alive, but blinded.

00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:59.440
 Okay?

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.440
 Nobody can fly it.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.440
 So then a helicopter is dispatched, so they have to get someone from the helicopter

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.440
 into the plane.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:05.440
 Into the hole.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.440
 Into the hole while the plane is flying.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.440
 Right.

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.440
 These are just good plots.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:10.440
 It's great.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.440
 Fantastic.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.440
 They're just like, there are seven basic plots.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.440
 This is one of them.

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.440
 How can you parody that?

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:15.440
 It's too great.

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.440
 I know.

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:18.440
 But then the fourth one, Airport 79.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.440
 Wow, they've made a lot of sequels.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:22.440
 Nice.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.440
 Kong.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.440
 In that one, the fourth one.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.440
 And that's what the airplane came from, basically.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.440
 Kong called does a loop the loop.

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.440
 And yeah.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:31.440
 And it was sure.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.440
 When it was shown on TV, they had to bulk it up.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:37.940
 So they just put in 21 minutes of extra footage so it could make a three-hour slot instead

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:38.940
 of a two-hour slot.

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:42.440
 They just shoved in random news footage and extra stuff.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:47.440
 Can I do a quick thing on biggest things in Britain?

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.440
 Yeah, go for it.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:51.440
 Do you know where the biggest telephone box is in the UK?

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.440
 In the UK.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:56.440
 And you're probably thinking, how are their different sizes?

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.440
 Yeah.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.440
 I thought they were standard.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.440
 Is this going to be a novelty?

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:03.440
 It is noticeably, and yes, another tillily to coin a word.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.440
 Isn't it well-pronounced?

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.440
 Isn't it?

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.440
 Oh, that's interesting.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.440
 And it's a red classic.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:10.440
 You'd go past it and go, oh, that's a big telephone box.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.440
 Definitely.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.440
 Would you go past it and go, that's effing cute.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.440
 That's a skyscraper.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.440
 Or you'd think, huh, that looks a bit off.

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.440
 I'd put it to you this way.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.440
 It's in, I believe, the knowledge.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.440
 Oh, I know what it will be.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.440
 It's going to be a gravestone.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.440
 It is not.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:28.440
 Although there is a connection to gravestones because the mausoleum, there's a mausoleum

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:32.440
 for whom the telephone box was inspired by the cap of it.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.440
 Okay.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.440
 Is inspired, you know this, don't you, Anna?

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.440
 Yes, so it's the shape of it.

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.440
 I can't remember whose.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.440
 I forget the name, but he's actually near Henry.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.440
 Huge architect.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:44.440
 Yes, but his house is just down the road from where we are right now.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.440
 Oh, wow.

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.440
 Anyway, moving on.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:50.440
 It's in Maida Vale, and it's built by this industrial designer.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.440
 He's a genuine, like, incredibly influential person.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.440
 His name is Philippe Stark.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.440
 He's built so many different things.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.440
 Buildings and bridges and all the rest of it.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:03.440
 I've recently come back from Japan where they have lots of different manhole covers

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.440
 that have ornate drawings on them, whether it's Pikachu or it's Pokemon.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.440
 Do you see them?

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.440
 They're everywhere.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.440
 That's so cool.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.440
 And they're so popular that they sell them.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.440
 You've probably mentioned this already.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:15.440
 But whilst I was there, I also noticed this building in the middle of Tokyo,

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.440
 which is in the shape of a beer.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:20.440
 And it is the Asahi Brewery building, and he designed that.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:24.440
 And it's gold, very nearly to the top, and then a white head.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:25.440
 That is his thing.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:26.440
 Fantastic.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:30.440
 And you also have just the left of the building, depending of where you're obviously standing.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.440
 There is another sort of sub-building where he has a golden flame.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:37.440
 Unfortunately, Japan thinks the flame looks a bit like a poo,

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.440
 so it's called, in Japanese, the golden poo.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.440
 Cool.

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:44.440
 So this guy designed that, but he also designed the double-decker telephone box,

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:47.440
 where he took two and put one on top of another, welded them together,

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:51.440
 and then made it look like a sort of 1930s-era Bakelite phone.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.440
 It's there, it's a tourist attraction.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.440
 What's two telephone boxes that look like a telephone?

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:58.440
 It's two telephone boxes that look like a giant upward telephone box.

00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.440
 Cool.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:00.440
 Can you climb up to the upper one?

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.440
 It's not so high.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:05.440
 But it's sort of you stand next to it and you'd look short.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:08.440
 If someone's using the one on the bottom level,

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:11.440
 do you have to climb over onto their shoulders to get to the top one?

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.440
 It's only double-decker in height.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.440
 Inside, it just has the one phone.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.440
 Oh, it's the phone at the top.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.440
 Anna, you've got the job on Microsoft.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.440
 You asked the right questions.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.440
 You've double-checked the nonsense that was coming out of my mouth.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.440
 But yes, it's in Mail of Ale.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:26.440
 It's quite close to the tube station.

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.440
 If you're curious, I certainly was.

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:29.440
 I went to see it.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.440
 It is very tall.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.440
 Do you know what's so cool about that as well?

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.440
 He lives in Made of Ale,

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:38.440
 and he built something that's made of ale.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.440
 Very cool.

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:40.440
 Very nice.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.440
 Incredible nonsense.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.440
 Thank you for indulging me.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.440
 Here's a quiz question then as well.

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:48.440
 You're living in Oslo, and suddenly in your city,

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.440
 they are welding all of your manhole covers shut,

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.440
 or 400, at least, that you know of.

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:55.440
 That you know of.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.440
 A well-welded shut.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.440
 Most people can only name 400 or 500 manholes.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.440
 So let's say 2010, something like that.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.440
 Wow.

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:04.440
 Okay.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:05.440
 Why?

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:06.440
 What's going on?

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.440
 Criminal activity.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:10.440
 This is where I lose the job at Microsoft.

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.440
 Sue a crime.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:13.440
 What's it?

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.440
 Trapping the mint.

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.440
 Trapping the mint.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.440
 Trapping the mint.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.440
 I've got it.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.440
 The turtles.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.440
 Yes.

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.440
 That's it.

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.440
 Beyond what that is.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.440
 They're trapping them inside.

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.440
 Yes.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:25.440
 Till they starve.

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:26.440
 Cut off the pizza supplies.

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.440
 That's it.

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.440
 The turtles will be ours in a week.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.440
 There we go.

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:30.440
 That's why manhole covers around,

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.440
 because it's a shape of a pizza.

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:36.440
 You've got the job.

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:37.440
 Oh, my God.

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.440
 You guys are going to hate me.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:39.440
 I haven't written down the answer.

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:40.440
 No, I'm joking.

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:41.440
 Of course.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.440
 So the answer is, if you're in Oslo,

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.440
 around that period of time,

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:46.440
 because if you see that happening,

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:49.440
 it means the American president is coming to town,

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.440
 because when the president comes,

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.440
 and so this happened at presidential inaugurations,

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:56.440
 this happens when they do big public speeches,

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.440
 they seal up all the manholes.

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.440
 In case he falls in.

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:02.440
 In case there would be assassins,

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.440
 we'll leave a bomb underneath.

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.440
 Or maybe not underneath.

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.440
 That's embarrassing for a president.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.440
 14 presidents have died falling into manholes.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.440
 The president and the vice president,

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.440
 they're carrying that giant plane of glass

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.440
 across the...

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.440
 And that's a problem.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.440
 It is.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.440
 All the rakes have to be tidied up,

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.440
 the loose-around tab.

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:23.440
 Super long thanks being carried by one person.

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.440
 Not allowed in his vicinity.

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:25.440
 I just...

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:28.440
 Can I raise a hand here of skepticism?

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.440
 I'm writing the hand of skepticism,

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:31.440
 and I'm saying, I'd be astonished

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.440
 if every time the president came to visit London,

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.440
 which I know he hasn't done for a while,

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:35.440
 because he doesn't give a shit,

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.440
 but we sealed up, we welded up all the farm manholes,

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:40.440
 and then someone had to come unweld them

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:41.440
 as soon as he'd gone.

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.440
 So it's not everywhere they go.

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.440
 It's not like there's maintenance workers

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:49.440
 running ahead of the black limo of the beast.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.440
 But it's for big events, that happens.

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:52.440
 They do do that.

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:53.440
 That's very cool.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.440
 Yeah, that's great.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.440
 I really want to tell a very boring fact now.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.440
 Go, go.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.440
 You know the difference between a typeface and a font, right?

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:01.440
 Oh, God, who doesn't?

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.440
 Who doesn't, obviously.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:03.440
 Yeah.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:06.440
 But I want to ask you guys as professional factors,

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.440
 are there facts which are so known

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.440
 that if someone tells them to you at a party,

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.440
 you're like, yeah, we know that one.

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:13.440
 We get it.

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.440
 That's basically you're in my relationship, Ally.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.440
 I think it is.

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:18.440
 You keep telling me things.

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:20.440
 I tell you things to go, yes, I'm aware

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.440
 that there are apples and apple pies.

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.440
 Yes, very good, Ally, very good.

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:27.440
 But that, why ampersands are called ampersands?

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.440
 Is that like a universally known thing for you guys?

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.440
 I don't know.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.440
 Tell us.

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.440
 Okay, here we go.

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.440
 The reason why an ampersand is called an ampersand

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.440
 is because it's actually a contraction of the phrase

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:42.440
 and, per se, and, right?

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.440
 So it is as quirky as that.

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:45.440
 It's a bit weird.

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.440
 So the original ampersand, which you know,

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.440
 the one you know well now is sort of a big loop

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.440
 and then it goes up and around and through.

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:55.440
 But it's actually sort of squishing together of ET.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.440
 An et-bing and, in Latin.

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.440
 There it is.

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:01.440
 So the name is a corruption of and, per se, and,

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:05.440
 i.e. it's and, and by itself, it also means and.

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.440
 I know this looks and sounds weird,

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:10.440
 but it's from Scribes, writing in Latin.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:11.440
 That's cool.

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:13.440
 And when you write it in an italic version,

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:14.440
 it sort of pushes them together

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:16.440
 and that's why it is called an ampersand.

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:17.440
 Right.

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:18.440
 I could have told that story better,

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.440
 but I promise you it's interesting.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.440
 Are you trying to get your word count up?

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:26.440
 I'm Dr. Spetchenin, the king of spacemans.

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:29.440
 But speaking of space and also printing and also journalism,

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:33.440
 Futura is the font that's in space.

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.440
 Okay.

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:36.440
 So bear with me here.

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.440
 A typographer, I believe that's the right term,

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:41.440
 called Paul Renner created the font, the typeface.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.440
 I know there's a difference.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:46.440
 Called Futura in 1927 and it was used by NASA

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:49.440
 for when they put the plaque on the moon.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.440
 That's great.

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:52.440
 And it's called Futura.

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.440
 That's so good, isn't it?

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:54.440
 Very cool.

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:55.440
 I didn't know that.

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:57.440
 And it's one of the most copied fonts typefaces.

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:58.440
 Everywhere.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:15:59.440
 I'm sorry, what is the difference?

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:00.440
 I don't know the difference.

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:01.440
 Yeah.

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:02.440
 Okay, here we go.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:03.440
 Turn left, have another day.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.440
 A typeface is not a font.

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:09.440
 Each variation of a typeface, bold, italicized, underlined,

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.440
 is called a font.

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:15.440
 But the typeface itself is what you're sort of more or less

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:16.440
 referring to.

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:17.440
 Yes, right.

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:21.440
 So Helvetica is a typeface, but it's font, italicized,

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.440
 underlined, bold.

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:26.440
 But the trouble is is that in America, it's sort of interchangeable

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:27.440
 and it doesn't matter so much.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.440
 And I think the prevalence of...

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.440
 Unlike here where if you use one rather than the other,

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.440
 you're out the window.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.440
 You've lost your job at Amstrad.

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:35.440
 Sorry.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.440
 Get out the window.

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:37.440
 No, it's just...

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:40.440
 Font is a set of type that is one particular face and size.

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:41.440
 That has...

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.440
 I have to say, I'm pretty sure Alex Brothers told me that

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:46.440
 1900 times and I've never remembered it when he has, so...

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:47.440
 I forgot it just as I said it.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:51.440
 Yeah, so typeface is the original and then the variations of fonts.

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:52.440
 Correct.

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:53.440
 That's great.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:54.440
 That's great.

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:56.440
 For Turo, every font must have a little story like that.

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:58.440
 I didn't know that Times New Roman was invented for the

00:16:58.440 --> 00:16:59.440
 Times newspaper in the UK.

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:01.440
 Like, that's specifically for them.

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:02.440
 That's pretty cool.

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:04.440
 Helvetica, Switzerland, the old word for Switzerland,

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.440
 that's why it's called that.

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:08.440
 There's also a documentary on the typeface of Helvetica,

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:10.440
 called Helvetica, I highly recommend it.

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.440
 And you were saying my sewage tracks were boring.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.440
 I know.

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:15.440
 They are so unfair.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:19.440
 But yeah, I know what you mean about this spider not being

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:21.440
 a qualified vampire because of size.

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.440
 I think that jumping spiders, of which this is the type,

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.440
 are just cheating quite a lot because you always see photos

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.440
 of them and they are quite beautiful looking.

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.440
 And there's like a peacock one, which is particularly nice.

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.440
 And you always forget in photos, they're heavily zoomed.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.440
 So I actually just want everyone to remember when you see

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.440
 a picture of a jumping spider that looks great,

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:38.440
 they're all only a millimeter or two, aren't they?

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:39.440
 So what?

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:40.440
 They're still lovely.

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.440
 It doesn't count.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.440
 It doesn't count.

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:44.440
 But they are amazing.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.440
 Something we haven't mentioned about jumping spiders before

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.440
 is that they have REM sleep.

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:51.440
 And I just like the way that they learn this.

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:54.440
 So when they are newborns for the first 10 days,

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:57.440
 they don't have any pigment on their exoskeleton,

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:59.440
 which means you can see straight through them.

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.440
 And also they've got huge eyes.

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.440
 So the way they tested this to find out if they have REM sleep

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.440
 is they got baby spiders.

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:09.440
 So you can see through their heads into their eyeballs,

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:10.440
 which are massive.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.440
 And then they just watch their eyeballs.

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:15.440
 And there was a scientist, Daniela Rusler,

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:18.440
 who held up a magnifying glass and got a night vision camera,

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:20.440
 watch the spiders sleeping.

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.440
 And you could literally see the spinnerettes,

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:24.440
 which are the organs that make silk,

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:28.440
 going insane suddenly with their eyes vibrating at the same time,

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.440
 showing their sort of practicing for making webs.

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:32.440
 Amazing.

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:33.440
 So they're dreaming, basically.

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:34.440
 They're dreaming.

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:36.440
 And sometimes they would suddenly, all of their limbs would

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.440
 flail out as if they're going, oh my god.

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:39.440
 Wow.

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:40.440
 Yeah, it's definitely like a dog sleeping.

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.440
 They do.

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:42.440
 Yeah.

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:43.440
 So they do have dream.

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:46.440
 It's possibly my favorite fact that I've certainly said on this

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:49.440
 show in the 10 years, which is that octopuses,

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.440
 we don't know if they have REM sleep,

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:54.440
 but there's one example where it might have shown that they are dreaming,

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:57.440
 because you only dream once you're in REM sleep, right?

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:59.440
 Is that they were observing an octopus,

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.440
 and it suddenly camouflage changed to something else

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:04.440
 while it was sleeping and then back again,

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:07.440
 as if it was scared by whatever it needed to hide from in a nightmare.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:08.440
 Yeah.

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:09.440
 Isn't that awesome?

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.440
 But we don't know.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:11.440
 We just don't know yet if that was a random thing

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:12.440
 or if that was a dream.

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.440
 I love that your favorite fact is we don't know.

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:15.440
 Yes.

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:16.440
 Yeah.

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:17.440
 Those are always my favorite.

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.440
 Here, Dan.

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:19.440
 By the way, I love that the--

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:22.440
 If I was writing a script of this spider, right?

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.440
 Mm-hmm.

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:26.440
 I'd sort of say it's creepy enough.

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:27.440
 You've got the creep factor.

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:28.440
 We're already scared.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:30.440
 We don't need to see through stuff.

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:31.440
 Come on.

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:33.440
 And then the flailing legs.

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:36.440
 The REM, like, it's sort of a town hat, you know?

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.440
 Yeah.

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:38.440
 We're already freaked out by it.

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:40.440
 Imagine if you could see into your baby.

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:41.440
 No.

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:42.440
 Your baby when it was born.

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:43.440
 Seeing into your baby.

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:44.440
 It's cool.

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:46.440
 It looks just like your father.

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:47.440
 Because they've--

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:48.440
 Because they're behind the baby.

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:51.440
 He's got your mother's liver.

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:53.440
 Hey, here's a surprising thing.

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.440
 The three of us, me, Andy and James,

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.440
 we're in Belgium recently.

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.440
 I didn't realize.

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.440
 You know, every time we go to Belgium, there's things like,

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.440
 "Oh, a monk beer," and all this stuff that they're so proud of.

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:03.440
 Not the single person has said,

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:05.440
 "Hey, welcome to the homeland of billiard balls,"

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:09.440
 to where 80% of all billiard balls that are used by professionals

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:10.440
 are manufactured.

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:13.440
 They are the great makers of billiard balls.

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:16.440
 And they had the world champion sneaker player last year.

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:17.440
 Did they?

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:18.440
 Yeah, Luca Bracel.

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.440
 Well, when you've got that many balls to play with,

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.440
 it's cheating.

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:22.440
 It is cheating.

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:23.440
 Yeah.

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:26.440
 Hands never out of his pockets.

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:27.440
 That's amazing.

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.440
 They don't know how to sell themselves is what you're saying.

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.440
 They're always wanging on about their chocolate and their beer,

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.440
 but focus on the billiard balls.

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.440
 That is amazing.

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:34.440
 You've got Tin Tin at the station.

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:36.440
 I didn't see a single billiard ball

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:37.440
 when I was getting on the Eurostar.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:38.440
 Crazy.

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:42.440
 You know that huge atomium that they have in Brussels?

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:46.440
 They claim that that's an atom, but actually it's billiard balls.

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:47.440
 That's a billiard ball.

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.440
 Oh, my God.

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.440
 Well, the world centre of cue making is Paris,

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:54.440
 which is a man called John Paris who lives in south London.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:56.440
 Very nice.

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.440
 He lives in Forest Hill.

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:01.440
 And there are queues outside the shop every day.

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:02.440
 Brilliant.

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:03.440
 Brilliant.

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:05.440
 Before he brings them in to salvage them.

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:08.440
 About half of professionals have had queues made by him.

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:09.440
 Really?

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:10.440
 In his workshop.

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:11.440
 He's a vander.

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:12.440
 He is.

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:13.440
 Actually.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:16.440
 The Harry Potter wizard wand merchant seller.

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:17.440
 That's it.

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:20.440
 Yes, because you have very specific queue desires, don't you?

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:23.440
 If you're a professional, make a player.

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:25.440
 Are you allowed to make a really, really long queue?

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:26.440
 There are probably rules on there.

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:27.440
 There's probably restrictions.

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:31.440
 I think you are, but it's not useful.

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:34.440
 Because you can't make a really, really long arm.

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:35.440
 Yeah.

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:36.440
 But it would be cool if you could stay in your...

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:39.440
 If you could win from your dressing room.

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:45.440
 Because a billiards table is so big, quite often you can't really reach the ball.

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:49.440
 So you can make extensions on your queue to make it longer and longer and longer.

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:56.440
 But to be the most efficient snookering technique, you really want one about the same size as your arm.

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:57.440
 That would be good though.

00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:01.440
 There's one mysterious snooker player that no one's ever seen.

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:03.440
 But it's his term of stick.

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:07.440
 Slowly comes Mr. Tickle.

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:13.440
 Blacksmithing, obviously the original metal shaping, was often dog powered.

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:15.440
 And this is until the 20th century.

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:18.440
 I found a picture from the 1930s.

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:21.440
 A video from the 1930s with the dog powered one.

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:27.440
 So I imagine a blacksmith gets a piece of metal, puts it in the fire till it's really hot,

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:29.440
 puts it on his anvil and hits it with a hammer.

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:31.440
 But I don't see where the dog could come in there.

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:32.440
 Yes, it's in that first bit.

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:34.440
 So the fire needs to stay hot.

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:37.440
 So you've got those bellows that keep the fire super hot.

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:43.440
 And you would often employ a little boy, because you had to pay them less to operate the bellows.

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:49.440
 Or they would have a wheel in the corner with a dog, a very obedient dog, just running around around the wheel.

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:53.440
 And that wheel would be connected to a series of pulleys that operated the bellows.

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.440
 It's bellows.

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:56.440
 Yeah, I know.

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.440
 It always seemed to be a bit of a novelty.

00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:06.440
 And he mentioned of it in history is, oh, there's a clever blacksmith in, you know, British Columbia who's got a dog operating the wheel.

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:10.440
 I feel like that used to be a dog job back in the day for multiple different things.

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:11.440
 Yes.

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:12.440
 Turned bent dogs.

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:13.440
 Exactly, yeah.

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:16.440
 Which we should say is where you turn meat using a dog.

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:20.440
 Yeah, the rotisserie chicken is turned via...

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.440
 They still use that in Tescos, don't they?

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:24.440
 Yeah.

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:26.440
 Amazing, the RSPCA hasn't gone on to them yet.

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:27.440
 They like it.

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:31.440
 If you heat up metal really, really, really, really high.

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.440
 As high as you can possibly imagine.

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:34.440
 Yeah.

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:39.440
 It acts almost exactly the same as how mayonnaise acts at quite low temperatures.

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:41.440
 You can spread it on toast.

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:49.440
 It's the way that it kind of flows, the way that you would, like if it's really cold mayonnaise, you won't be able to spread it.

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:51.440
 Do you mean at normal temperature mayonnaise?

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:55.440
 Cold temperature mayonnaise, but not freezing, but just ultra cold.

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.440
 Okay.

00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:00.440
 Yeah, so those two things are basically identical for physicists.

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:05.440
 Which means that if you're ever trying something out and you need to work out what the metal's going to do at high temperatures,

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:09.440
 like for fusion reactions or whatever, you can use mayonnaise instead.

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:10.440
 Oh, really?

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:13.440
 It can just cool down some helmets a little bit.

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:16.440
 And it'll give you exactly the same conditions as a molten metal.

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:17.440
 That's crazy.

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.440
 Wouldn't the molten, oh so the molten metal, so it has melted at this point.

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:22.440
 So imagine you've kind of melted your metal.

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:27.440
 It's kind of rolling down like maybe lava or something down a slope.

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.440
 And you want to know what's exactly is going to happen.

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:33.440
 You can just cool down some mayonnaise till just before it's going to freeze and pour the mayonnaise.

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:37.440
 Hellman's is almost the perfect name for molten lava.

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:40.440
 Hellman.

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:42.440
 And do they do this?

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:46.440
 Is it like you'll get physicists who buy up 20 jars of mayonnaise for the next experiment?

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:50.440
 Yes, there is a group of physicists who are doing that right now.

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:51.440
 Cool.

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:54.440
 During lockdown, that's why we were all in the toilet paper section,

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:57.440
 but physicists were just clawing through the mayonnaise area.

00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:59.440
 Wow, that's very cool.

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.440
 That is incredible.

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:05.440
 Did you see about moss in space as an actual moss in space?

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:07.440
 No, this is like ISS stuff.

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:10.440
 It was, was it at the ISS?

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.440
 Oh gosh, no.

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:16.440
 So this was on the Space Shuttle Columbia missions.

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:20.440
 And they grew moss on those missions.

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:24.440
 And they found really interestingly that it grew in a spiral.

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:29.440
 Because what you would think is, OK, if moss grows in a direction due to gravity,

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:31.440
 then that's one thing.

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.440
 And when you go in space where there's no gravity,

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:36.440
 it'll just go in random filaments and random orders and you wouldn't know why.

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:39.440
 But actually it goes into spirals and we don't know why.

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:40.440
 Interesting.

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:41.440
 Cool.

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:42.440
 Because it's pretty, you know?

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.440
 Moss has got a sense of the aesthetic, hasn't it?

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:46.440
 Something fractal, probably something fractal.

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:53.440
 Alright, dude, have another toke.

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:55.440
 Here's a cool thing.

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:56.440
 This is amazing.

00:25:56.440 --> 00:26:00.440
 Right, so every second, the Sun gets four billion kilos lighter

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:02.440
 because it's eaten up that much matter.

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:03.440
 How interesting.

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:05.440
 It eats stuff and gets lighter.

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.440
 If only we could crack this.

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:12.440
 Oh, weird.

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:15.440
 I've been staring at this thing for three days now.

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:19.440
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:23.440
 But despite that, four billion kilos every second, that's so much.

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:24.440
 That's a lot.

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:25.440
 It's a big diet.

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:26.440
 It's a big thing, isn't it?

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:27.440
 That's it.

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:32.440
 In its lifetime, it's converted 100 Earth's worth of mass into energy.

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:33.440
 OK.

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:38.440
 But that is just three thousandths of its total mass that it's used up so far.

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:41.440
 So it is going to last a very, very, very, very long time.

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:43.440
 Even longer than that heavy press machine.

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:44.440
 Right, exactly.

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:47.440
 But I found this amazing calculation on a physics website.

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:51.440
 OK, so if we captured-- have you heard of a Dyson sphere, right?

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:52.440
 Yep.

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:55.440
 It's where you basically harvest all the energy of a star.

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:59.440
 You basically put a load of solar panels all the way around the Sun.

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:00.440
 Yeah, you wrap them.

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:03.440
 And so like literally no light can escape from it.

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:06.440
 So you're getting perfect, almost perfect amount of light.

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:07.440
 Exactly.

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.440
 So you can use that energy for something.

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:10.440
 Yeah.

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:12.440
 And so it's proposed by Freeman J. Dyson.

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:14.440
 And he said we should be looking for these things.

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:16.440
 Not we should be building one, but we should look for one,

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:18.440
 because that'll probably be evidence of an alien civilization.

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:21.440
 Yeah, they reckon that eventually, if you're advanced enough,

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:22.440
 you will build one of these.

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:23.440
 Right.

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:25.440
 Eventually we will, and eventually some other people must have done.

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:26.440
 Sorry, such a cool idea.

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:28.440
 So OK, here's the question.

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:32.440
 If we captured all of our Sun's energy for just one second,

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:33.440
 Yeah.

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:36.440
 how long would we be able to power human civilization for, right?

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:37.440
 OK.

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:38.440
 Oh, OK.

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:40.440
 What's the total usage of electricity and energy?

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:43.440
 So we do use a lot of energy on Earth, I've read.

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:44.440
 Sure.

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:45.440
 Like for Bitcoin mining and stuff.

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:46.440
 Yeah.

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:48.440
 There are a lot of solar panels now as well.

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:49.440
 Yeah.

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:50.440
 Oh, yeah.

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:53.440
 And that is only a tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny proportion of Earth

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:55.440
 even now that is covered inside the panels, right?

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:57.440
 So how long, sorry, say the question one more time.

00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:01.440
 So it's all of the Sun's energy in total for one second.

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.440
 Yeah.

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:04.440
 How long could we power human civilization?

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:05.440
 Roughly the current rate of usage.

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:06.440
 150,000 years.

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:07.440
 Oh, wow.

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:08.440
 Wow, sis.

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:10.440
 I was going to give more like 3,000 years.

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:13.440
 Yeah, I was going for like since the birth of Jesus, so 2,000 years.

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:14.440
 OK.

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:16.440
 150,000 feels like it might be ruining Andy's fact.

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:19.440
 You've done the old overshoot the fact and now...

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:21.440
 Sorry, three months, Andy.

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.440
 Don't invite me to a party.

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:26.440
 This is based on world energy consumption in 2018.

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:29.440
 And it assumes that you only capture it at 20% efficiency.

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:32.440
 So solar panels these days can do kind of 25-ish.

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:34.440
 I mean, good solar panels, right?

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:36.440
 If you, even if you only got it at 20% efficiency,

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:38.440
 if you got all of the Sun's energy for one second,

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:42.440
 you could power Earth for 953,000 years.

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:44.440
 Oh, undershot it, then.

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:46.440
 Yeah, apologies.

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:48.440
 It's Anna, even before you say it.

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:52.440
 It's unbelievable how much free energy

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.440
 just comes from the Sun.

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:55.440
 That is amazing.

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:58.440
 But I was doing your favor there by making Dan's guests sound huge,

00:28:58.440 --> 00:28:59.440
 so yours would sound even huge.

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:00.440
 Thank you.

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:01.440
 Wow, thank you.

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:02.440
 Yeah, three months.

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:03.440
 Idiot.

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:05.440
 (LAUGHTER)

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:09.440
 In India, you were mentioning at the beginning, Andy,

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:13.440
 that, you know, who has different handwriting these days

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:16.440
 in the way that James is mentioning, and doctors was one of them.

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:19.440
 And in India, there was a thing that became official in 2012,

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:23.440
 which is that handwriting had to become legible from doctors

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:25.440
 and either had to be written in block letters

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.440
 or just had to be really clear,

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:30.440
 because they were finding that there were so many deaths

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:33.440
 or quite ill people off the back of handwriting

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:35.440
 being misunderstood when the pharmacist

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:37.440
 is giving out the prescription.

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:40.440
 And there were so many drugs that are just one letter different

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.440
 that might have the counter effect that you want

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:44.440
 for what you actually prescribed.

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:47.440
 And so, yeah, and so they've actually passed that.

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:50.440
 And so doctors have had to change this weird,

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:51.440
 crazy, unreadable...

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:54.440
 It was like hypertension or hypotension.

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:55.440
 Oh, yeah.

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:56.440
 That's a good one.

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:58.440
 If you get one or the other, you're buggered, aren't you?

00:29:58.440 --> 00:29:59.440
 Yeah, exactly.

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:02.440
 And there are cases, although you do read some wild claims online

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:04.440
 about sort of, you know, 20 million deaths a day,

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:07.440
 of course, by doctors' handwriting, but it is quite valid.

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:10.440
 I read 7,000, but yeah, 20 million.

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:11.440
 Yeah, I think.

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:13.440
 It's actually 27 and 20 million, yeah.

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:16.440
 I don't think it's even that much, but...

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:18.440
 The problem was that the study was written by...

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:20.440
 That's how it is said.

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:24.440
 I think it is true that it uses up so much time.

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:27.440
 So there was an estimate by the Institute

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:31.440
 for safe medication practices that in decipherable prescriptions,

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:32.440
 largely because of bad handwriting,

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:36.440
 result in 150 million calls in America alone...

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:37.440
 What?

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:39.440
 ...from pharmacists to doctors a year,

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:42.440
 which is that's the amount of time that's being used up on...

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:43.440
 That's stunning.

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.440
 Isn't that incredible?

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:47.440
 So that's, you know, many, many millions of dollars wasted.

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:49.440
 That is a case of just typing it out.

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:51.440
 Yeah, and I think we're getting more closer and closer to everyone

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:52.440
 just putting stuff.

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:54.440
 It's a nice rom-com as well, you know,

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:56.440
 a pharmacist having to call the same doctor each time

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:58.440
 to sort of chat, "Which did you mean?"

00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:00.440
 And then he falls in love with her,

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:03.440
 so he's purposefully giving the wrong spelling on stuff.

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:05.440
 Was this Viagra or Viagra?

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:14.440
 All right, there we go.

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:16.440
 That is all of our outtakes.

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:18.440
 If you would like to get in contact with any of us

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:21.440
 about the things that were said over the course of these clips,

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:23.440
 you can get us on our social media accounts.

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:26.440
 You can get us generally at podcast@qi.com

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:28.440
 if you want to send an email in.

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:30.440
 Maybe that email will be read out on a future Drop Us a Line.

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:31.440
 So do send them in.

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:34.440
 And also, remember what I said at the top of the show,

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:37.440
 we are doing a really fun, silly live night.

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:40.440
 It's going to be a fish recording, a full episode,

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:42.440
 with lots of new bits chucked in between

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:45.440
 for us to test out ahead of our Thunder Nerds tour.

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:47.440
 If you want to come and see us do that,

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:50.440
 it's going to be at the Underbelly Boulevard Soho London,

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:52.440
 7pm on Monday, the 12th of August.

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:54.440
 Tickets are available now,

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:56.440
 and we can't wait to get on stage

00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:59.440
 and test out all of these ideas we've been having.

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:02.440
 So you'll see a lot of stuff that won't make it into the final tour,

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:04.440
 or even if you're coming into the tour,

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:06.440
 you'll see something right at the start

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:08.440
 that will have evolved into something very different by the end.

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:10.440
 It will be a really fun night, so yeah, get your tickets now.

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:12.440
 Otherwise, come back in a couple of weeks.

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.440
 We're going to have another Drop Us a Line, more compilations.

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:16.440
 We will see you then. Goodbye.

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:19.020
 (upbeat music)

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:21.600
 (upbeat music)
