1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
 We run it on QI a few years ago.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,200
 Yeah.

3
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,360
 And which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

4
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,680
 It's kind of nice, there's nothing as a fish.

5
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,080
 No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,560
 He says it, right there, first paragraph.

7
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,760
 No such thing as a fish.

8
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:24,440
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

9
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,120
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,360
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with four other elves.

11
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:35,400
 I've got Andy Murray, James Harkin, Anna Chisinski, and on fact checking duties, Alex Bell.

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,840
 So once again, we've gathered around the microphone with our favorite facts from the last seven

13
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,840
 days.

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,480
 And in no particular order, here we go.

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,960
 Anna, fact number one.

16
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,720
 My effect is that made in Germany, product labels were originally intended to put people

17
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,960
 off buying the product.

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,940
 It was a law pass in England in 1887, which forced foreign companies to put labels saying

19
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,960
 where the product had been made on their items, because British companies were worried about

20
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,500
 German knockoff products flooding their market and being cheap and tacky.

21
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,260
 Typical inferior Germans.

22
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,260
 Exactly.

23
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,260
 The poor manufacturing base.

24
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,620
 I'm terrible footballing students.

25
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:15,280
 Baron, it was mainly to say the Sheffield cutlery industry, obviously it's ironic, because

26
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,500
 made in Germany very, very quickly became a stamp of very high quality.

27
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,460
 So true fencer is German?

28
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,260
 It became popular during Nazi regime.

29
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,500
 It wasn't invented specifically for it.

30
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,980
 Oh, I thought Hitler commissioned it.

31
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,020
 I thought he wanted like a German soft drink.

32
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,020
 That's what people think.

33
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,980
 But it became popular then, but it wasn't invented specifically by Hitler.

34
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,340
 That would be surprising.

35
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,940
 I find it very weird when countries decide that their products have to be patriotic or

36
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:48,840
 like, you know, the classic thing during the war in Iraq when America and France fell

37
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,840
 out.

38
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,420
 Freedom fries became the thing.

39
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:58,340
 I love the story of freedom fries because it was one guy, it was a Republican chairman called

40
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,340
 Bob Nay.

41
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:04,700
 And he renamed the menus of three congressional cafeterias with freedom fries.

42
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,700
 That's how it started.

43
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,900
 And then it just spread from there.

44
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,900
 Yeah.

45
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:11,700
 And he didn't need to tell anyone about it because he has control over the cafeterias.

46
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,380
 So he just said, this is happening, and so they changed it.

47
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,380
 Isn't that amazing?

48
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,380
 He has control.

49
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,380
 Yeah.

50
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,380
 Fascistic.

51
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,380
 In position of freedom based.

52
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,380
 Yeah.

53
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:26,860
 I did read a reference to supposedly French kissing a couple of real zealots decided they

54
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,860
 were now going to do only freedom kissing.

55
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,020
 I don't think that caught on either.

56
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,020
 I would say that.

57
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,020
 Freedom toast as well for a French toast.

58
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,220
 He also changed that on the menu, and that didn't get as much press.

59
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,220
 I don't know why.

60
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,220
 Freedom bread.

61
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,220
 You can make a substitution for anything, which is French.

62
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:45,100
 And you free the movie starring Gerard Depadieu, dawned freedom, of course, famously the comedian.

63
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:51,140
 Apparently, the boycotted French is mustard, even though it's owned by a British company,

64
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,980
 and it's named after an American guy called Mr. French.

65
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:54,980
 That's right.

66
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,460
 He actually came out and said, please don't boycott us.

67
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,820
 It's just a surname of our family.

68
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,860
 Have you guys heard of Star Spangled Ice Cream?

69
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,860
 Yeah.

70
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,860
 We heard this.

71
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,860
 This is brilliant.

72
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,300
 So it was conservative Americans had an ice cream company, and they gave their ice creams

73
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:17,220
 punning names. So for instance, the mint ice cream was called smaller government.

74
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:22,380
 So can you guess what the chocolate ice cream was called during the bombardment of Afghanistan?

75
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:30,060
 Well, it was called chocolate or even better than vanilla ice cream was called.

76
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,820
 I hate the French video.

77
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,780
 But it's right to the point just back to the freedom fries thing very quickly.

78
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,780
 It was really nice.

79
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,780
 It was a counter.

80
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,580
 So when people were doing the freedom fries thing, there was a cafe in Santa Cruz, which changed

81
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:50,220
 their menu of fries to impeach George W. Bush fries, which is really nice as nuts to

82
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,220
 that.

83
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:55,420
 Speaking of labels, there were these American handbags, Tom Bin handbags, and they have

84
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:59,420
 washing instructions in English and French that were made during the Bush era.

85
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,340
 And the English ones are perfectly normal, and then when you read them in French, they

86
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,580
 say, do not bleach, do not dry and dry.

87
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,580
 Do not iron.

88
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,900
 We are sorry, our president is an idiot.

89
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,900
 We did not vote for him.

90
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,900
 That's great.

91
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,900
 That's lovely.

92
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,460
 In the first world war, there's exactly the same thing happened with all German name products

93
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,460
 in the USA.

94
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:19,460
 So Sauerkraut was called Liberty Cabbage.

95
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:25,500
 And that was renamed as a result of a delegation, but petitioning the Federal Food Administration,

96
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,780
 they said that Sauerkraut consumption had decreased by 75% since 1914 over the course

97
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,780
 of the war.

98
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:35,340
 And they said, look, we've got 400 tons of it in New York alone on our hands.

99
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,020
 Please rename it so that we can actually sell some of this stuff.

100
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,020
 That's cool.

101
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,020
 Yeah.

102
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,620
 German measles became Liberty measles.

103
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,620
 Yeah.

104
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,620
 I think some are fun to know.

105
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,700
 Although that's sort of on the fringe of, you know, freedom kissing or whatever.

106
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:52,300
 I was thinking about on Germany, because obviously Maiden Germany now is something that's associated

107
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,540
 with high quality.

108
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:57,780
 And in fact, the obverse to my original fact, which is that Maiden Germany was imposed

109
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:03,020
 on the Germans by the English, now the EU regulations are saying that labeling should

110
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,020
 be more accurate.

111
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,700
 So if actually most of the work on a product has done in Bangladesh, and the most expensive

112
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,540
 part comes from India, then you're not allowed to say Maiden Germany, because you're a German

113
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,540
 company.

114
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,940
 And Germans are saying that's really unfair.

115
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,180
 One of the reasons people buy our products is because it says Maiden Germany, because they're

116
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,180
 really good.

117
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,260
 Anyway, this is a long-winded way of saying German economy is great and maybe there's something

118
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:26,580
 to do with the fact that their word for borrow is the same as their word for guilt.

119
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,980
 So they obviously have really, really good borrowing rates.

120
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:29,980
 What?

121
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:30,980
 Personal borrowing is very low.

122
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:31,980
 Because it's shameful.

123
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:32,980
 It's shameful.

124
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,220
 So if you borrow, you have to say the word guilt.

125
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,940
 That wasn't really round the butt way of talking about this.

126
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:39,940
 It was, wasn't it?

127
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,940
 It was.

128
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,940
 Good.

129
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:45,460
 I think I wanted to inform people about the EU regulation at the same time as rounding

130
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,460
 it off.

131
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,460
 No one can say you didn't do that.

132
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,060
 I think I did.

133
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,020
 So I was looking into Maiden China as a label.

134
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:57,820
 I was really surprised by stuff that they produce 85% of all artificial Christmas trees

135
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,820
 are from China.

136
00:05:58,820 --> 00:05:59,820
 Yeah, really.

137
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:04,780
 But other things that are made in China, the US uniforms for the 2012 Olympics.

138
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,780
 Really?

139
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,780
 Yeah.

140
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:11,540
 And also in 2008, police in China said they discovered a factory making free Tibet flags.

141
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,540
 Yeah.

142
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:17,900
 But apparently the workers at the factory said they thought they were just making colourful

143
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:18,900
 flags.

144
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,660
 They didn't know the significance of them.

145
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,980
 So the Maiden China label is exactly the same as Maiden Germany is in Japan, forced it

146
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:27,780
 on the Chinese to say to discourage people from buying Chinese products shortly afterwards.

147
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,780
 No way.

148
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,860
 Quite like funny labels on stuff.

149
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:35,900
 And I just remembered that the iPod shuffle when it first came out on its little safety labels

150
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:40,620
 said, do not eat iPod shuffle, which was useful.

151
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:47,340
 My sister bought a pram for her first kid Sophia and it was a huge box and on the side of

152
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,580
 the box it has a picture of a baby saying baby not included.

153
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,660
 I can't tell if it was a joke or if it was, yeah.

154
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,660
 All right.

155
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,660
 We should wrap up on this one.

156
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,700
 Alex, have you got anything to add going back to soft drinks?

157
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,380
 Fanta was invented actually by Coca-Cola because they couldn't import their syrup into

158
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,380
 North Germany.

159
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:09,180
 So they were trying to make up a drink using the leftovers that were available.

160
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,180
 Okay.

161
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,300
 Time for fact number two.

162
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:16,820
 And that is my fact and my fact this week is in 1991, a professor at Iowa State University

163
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:20,940
 proposed that we could solve virtually every problem of human existence by blowing up

164
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,940
 the moon.

165
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:22,940
 Not every problem.

166
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,940
 This is what he said.

167
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,420
 Not losing the remote.

168
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,420
 I think that was included.

169
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,380
 I think he went literally through.

170
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,380
 Wow.

171
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,300
 So what problems are we solving and how?

172
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:38,580
 Well, the problems range from weather problems to famine, to disease.

173
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:43,660
 Now, it has been pointed out by most scientists alive that this is not the case.

174
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,060
 It would not solve the problems.

175
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:50,020
 In fact, NASA were saying that if we did blow up the moon, most likely part of the exploded

176
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:54,620
 moon would come back as a meteorite impacting on Earth and causing sufficient damage to

177
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,940
 extinguish, extinguish all life.

178
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:01,380
 So actually, slightly the reverse effect of what he said, no, it kind of would solve all

179
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,860
 our problems to be gone.

180
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,380
 We wouldn't have any problems anymore.

181
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,380
 That's true.

182
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,380
 Yeah.

183
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,500
 He thought, and his name was professor Alexander Abyan.

184
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,660
 His idea was that you would do it remotely from Earth.

185
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,900
 So you would put explosives into the moon and just push about and...

186
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,220
 When did he say that?

187
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,220
 1991.

188
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,220
 All right.

189
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,220
 It's quite recent then.

190
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,220
 Yeah.

191
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,220
 Yeah.

192
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,220
 He's dead now, unfortunately.

193
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,660
 And his children say that he was a very sane man.

194
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,660
 So this is not...

195
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,140
 This is not as if he was a lunatic.

196
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,900
 He was a very much loved mathematics professor at his university.

197
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:34,460
 There have been a lot of wacky suggestions about how to save the world over the years, haven't

198
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,460
 there?

199
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,460
 Some of them you've got to admire.

200
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,460
 And apparently they...

201
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,460
 Some of them could work.

202
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,500
 So one idea is that we wrap Greenland up in a blanket.

203
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,500
 You guys read this?

204
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,500
 No.

205
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,500
 No.

206
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,060
 So the problem is so all the... all the greeners' eyes is melting.

207
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,060
 That's obviously a bit of an issue.

208
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:53,300
 So in 2009, a bunch of geoengineers covered Greenland in this big, quite blanket.

209
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,660
 And there's meant to reflect the sun, so it means that the sun doesn't heat up and melt

210
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,660
 the ice.

211
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,300
 And it was surprising and successful, more successful than predicted, but it would cost about

212
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,380
 a trillion dollars to do it to the entirety of Greenland.

213
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,380
 Oh.

214
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,380
 Pretty weird.

215
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,780
 It's strange that putting a duvet on something would cool it down.

216
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,780
 Yeah.

217
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,780
 You would think it would just melt it.

218
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,780
 Mm.

219
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,460
 But in a hot country, if you go on, if you've got the sun blazing in on you and you've

220
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,460
 hide under a duvet here, think...

221
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,460
 Well, it's just not a very hot country.

222
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,460
 No.

223
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,460
 That's a fair point.

224
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,860
 So is the theory work or not?

225
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,980
 Yeah, it did work, but it's just that it's way too expensive to be at all feasible.

226
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,980
 Yeah.

227
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:32,500
 My favourite fact about Greenland is that until quite recently, 10% of the whole population

228
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,300
 lived in the same apartment block.

229
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,300
 What?

230
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,300
 No.

231
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,300
 One, one percent.

232
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,300
 Was it one percent?

233
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,300
 Yeah.

234
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,300
 It was something like 400 people out of 40,000, I think.

235
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,300
 Yeah.

236
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,300
 Something like that.

237
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,300
 Isn't that cool?

238
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,300
 Yeah, that's really good.

239
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,500
 It's called Block K, I think, or something like that.

240
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,500
 Block P.

241
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,500
 I got that completely wrong, didn't I?

242
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,940
 I knew there was a fact in there somewhere.

243
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,060
 So, did we work out what kind of problems he was going to solve?

244
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,980
 It was one of those things where he kind of just made the statements.

245
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,820
 He didn't publish a paper on it or anything.

246
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:04,420
 He just kind of loosely gave the territories and it was stuff like the weather pattern.

247
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,620
 He didn't really go into it.

248
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,620
 Ties.

249
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,620
 Ties.

250
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,620
 I've been cut off at high tide on a beach.

251
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,620
 Yeah.

252
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,620
 It's always a nightmare.

253
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,620
 That's going to stop.

254
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,620
 Yeah.

255
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,620
 Losing a remote.

256
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,620
 That was a big part of his decision, man.

257
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,020
 Would there be any tides left without the moon?

258
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,020
 Yeah.

259
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,020
 Because the sun does...

260
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,020
 Has tidal faucets...

261
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,020
 There are other tides as well.

262
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:27,300
 Yeah, it would mean that it would be high tide at midday every day, everywhere in the world

263
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,300
 where you were.

264
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,300
 If it was midday, it'd be high tide.

265
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,300
 Oh, that's so boring.

266
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,100
 It's like decimalisation, isn't it?

267
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,100
 So, no.

268
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,340
 All those tide timetables that I have to be reprinted as, actually.

269
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:39,300
 The crazy pound-shilling and pens world of the moon.

270
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,300
 Yeah.

271
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:45,660
 The mollusks reproductive organs grow and shrink according to the phases of the moon.

272
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,660
 So, if there was no moon, would they stay big or stay small?

273
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,700
 It depends when you blew up the moon.

274
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,700
 Yeah.

275
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:55,780
 They'd be a powerful lobby from the mollusk community to blow it up when they were big.

276
00:10:55,780 --> 00:11:00,180
 Is that like the wind changing when the moon blows up your face?

277
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,180
 You'll be stuck that way.

278
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:04,780
 Your testicle will remain the same size forever.

279
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,260
 I think we shouldn't be too judgmental.

280
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,220
 It should be because I think he...

281
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,220
 Abian?

282
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,220
 Is that what he was called?

283
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,220
 Yeah.

284
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,820
 When he died, he said, "Those critics who dismissed my ideas are very close to those

285
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,820
 who dismissed Galileo."

286
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:19,660
 And it was true, you know, when Galileo was thinking that.

287
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:23,580
 So maybe 300 years when the moon's just in shattered pieces across the universe.

288
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,060
 I don't think Galileo ever proposed blowing up the moon.

289
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,420
 It wasn't smart enough.

290
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,420
 For me, captain.

291
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,420
 It's such a cool...

292
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:35,100
 There wasn't plan to do a new clear explosion on the moon, wasn't there, by America, as

293
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,500
 a show of might to the Russians.

294
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,500
 Wow.

295
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,500
 Yeah.

296
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,500
 It was like a PR exercise.

297
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,500
 Oh, that is fascinating.

298
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,300
 Sort of pointlessly exploding something.

299
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,300
 Yeah.

300
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,300
 I mean, it wouldn't have blown up the moon.

301
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,900
 It wouldn't have just made a bit of a flash.

302
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:51,820
 The idea was the Russians would look up and go, "Oh my God, they blew up a bit of the moon.

303
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,700
 They must be a lot better than us, do you?"

304
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,700
 Oh, they've got terrible aim.

305
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,580
 Well, they're trying to hit us there.

306
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:02,660
 They must have in Europe come on, they can't hit up them though.

307
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:09,140
 I, of course, have taken my head, because I know that is going to say something about yetis

308
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,140
 or vampires.

309
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:14,140
 No, it's my favourite book of recent times that I purchased, which is called Who Built

310
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,140
 the Moon.

311
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:20,700
 And it's a really lovely theory that the moon is artificial, because back when the rocks

312
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:25,780
 were originally brought back from NASA's Apollo 11 mission, the geologists who were studying

313
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:28,100
 the rocks said, "This says made in China."

314
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:34,940
 No, they said that basically the moon is just, "It's such a weird thing, the moon.

315
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:39,260
 The way it sits, the position it sits in, the perfectness of the distance between the

316
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:45,580
 sun and the earth, and just all the features that it allows for the tides and all that, it

317
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:51,340
 just, it's easier to prove it doesn't exist than to prove it does exist."

318
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:55,380
 There are people called eco-sexuals, do you know about these guys?

319
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,380
 No.

320
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,380
 What's going on?

321
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,780
 Is it people who like having sex with the planet?

322
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,780
 Yes.

323
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,780
 In a way.

324
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,420
 There are people who have married the moon.

325
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,420
 Oh, wow.

326
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:09,220
 There were also people who married the earth, and they interviewed these people, and they

327
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:13,460
 said there were 450 others, and we're all married to the earth.

328
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,340
 Has anyone had a divorce to the earth because they fell off of the moon?

329
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,860
 I don't think so.

330
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:22,820
 Because actually these people who married the moon and married the earth, they also married

331
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:26,220
 the Appalachian mountains and some snow in Ottawa.

332
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,780
 I'm tiring of these people.

333
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:31,580
 When they go to Spain later this summer, according to the news report, they plan to marry

334
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,340
 some hunks of coal in the city of Guizhoub.

335
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:40,940
 These people are alive now, so they're all sluts, basically, just putting themselves out

336
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:41,940
 there for an incentive.

337
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:45,780
 It's been the wedding ceremony, though, where you've got the person standing on one side

338
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,660
 of the altar and the entire earth on the other side of the earth.

339
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:53,180
 Where are the guests sit or a mountain range?

340
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,580
 You might now kiss the snow.

341
00:13:55,580 --> 00:14:01,300
 The wedding ended tragically early when the groom melted.

342
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,980
 So could we survive without the moon?

343
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,900
 Is that at all possible?

344
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,900
 I don't think so.

345
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,900
 I doubt it.

346
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,220
 There would be earthquakes, wouldn't there, and volcanoes?

347
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:16,220
 One theory is that the earth's rotational axis, as if it just disappeared, that the earth's

348
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:20,780
 rotational axis would go way off and provoke drastic climate change.

349
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:25,620
 Oh, yeah, because doesn't the moon stop us from wobbling like there's a natural wobble

350
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:29,460
 of planets, and because we have the moon, it steadies the earth, and without that I think

351
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:32,820
 it would cause dramatic climate change.

352
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,060
 We like what happens to Mars.

353
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,060
 Oh, really?

354
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,260
 I think so, like, as in we were done with no atmosphere.

355
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,260
 We're so lucky to have the moon.

356
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,260
 Yeah.

357
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,260
 Thank you, moon.

358
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,460
 And your friend, Dan, is trying to destroy it.

359
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,460
 I know.

360
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,460
 He wants to help.

361
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:51,300
 There's an amazing thing, and Alex, you'll probably have to help me find the proper fact

362
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,300
 about this.

363
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,540
 But there was a story about when Apollo 10 went around the backside of the moon.

364
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:00,980
 So you know how you lose contact with the earth, because you can't get any signals.

365
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:01,980
 Yes.

366
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,860
 And so we're going to, on a regular day, it's like this terrible signal.

367
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,500
 So they have a few minutes behind the moon.

368
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,860
 And the astronauts in Apollo 10, as they were going around the moon, they started hearing

369
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,620
 this amazing orchestra, and they couldn't explain it.

370
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:19,060
 And what's really interesting is it's only recently that they've declassified these papers.

371
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:22,940
 And the conversation that they had was they were going, we can't tell everyone back on

372
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:26,460
 earth that we're hearing this because they just won't believe us.

373
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:29,700
 That will be our career over if we suddenly claim to hear this orchestra.

374
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,140
 Let them years to work out what it was.

375
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:36,780
 It turns out that it was a beam that was coming off from Saturn, I think it was.

376
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,100
 Alex, you might have to help me on that one there.

377
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,100
 I can fight.

378
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:44,020
 I found a video about the phenomenon and it obviously happened, but I can't find anything

379
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,420
 about an explanation.

380
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:49,500
 Eugene Sennon described it several times as an outer space-y style type music.

381
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,500
 He probably just swallowed his iPod Nano.

382
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,500
 Perfect.

383
00:15:54,500 --> 00:16:00,860
 I've seen a keen musician, I used a Glockenspiel player.

384
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:06,900
 He played a really fun prank in 1976 on April 1st, because obviously he did his radio program,

385
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,900
 what was it called?

386
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,900
 Sky night.

387
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,900
 Sky at night.

388
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,900
 But on April 1st, 1976, Patrick Moore told a radio audience that unusual planetary alignment

389
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:18,840
 would cause people on earth to weigh a little bit less at 947 in the morning, and if everyone

390
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:22,260
 jumped in the air, they'd experience a strange sensation of weightlessness.

391
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,260
 Lots of people did it.

392
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:26,660
 And they immediately called up the radio to say, "Hey, it happened, I felt it."

393
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,140
 I was weightless for a second.

394
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,620
 People claim they actually levitated.

395
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,620
 That's great.

396
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,620
 It's such a good hoax.

397
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,620
 I love it.

398
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:36,860
 I like the fact that the first person to play golf, probably the only person to play golf

399
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:41,620
 on the moon, Alan Sheppard, missed it on his first attempt to kind of enjoy the fact that

400
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,620
 he missed the shot.

401
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:45,900
 To be fair, he was in a space suit, I guess it's hard to take a golf ball.

402
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,820
 One thing I really, really like is that when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin first landed

403
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:53,980
 on the moon, they just landed at NASA, got in touch with them and ordered them to eat a

404
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,460
 meal and go to sleep.

405
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,460
 Yeah.

406
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,460
 Can you imagine having just landed on the moon and being told to go to bed?

407
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,460
 It's happening.

408
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,460
 Yeah, it's happening.

409
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,460
 Can we get to the moon?

410
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,660
 This is what we need to do.

411
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:08,220
 We don't deserve to be contacted by at this point.

412
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:12,820
 Okay, time for fact number three, and that is James Harkin.

413
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:19,660
 Okay, my fact this week is something I read on mentalfloss.com, and it is that in

414
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:26,020
 New York City until 1925, drivers going east or west stopped to the number light and drove

415
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:32,780
 on green, while drivers going north or south drove on the number light and stopped on green.

416
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,580
 So it was it was it like a traffic light that had no back?

417
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:39,540
 Yeah, you could see it from all different directions, so, but you'd have to know whether

418
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:42,900
 you're going east or west or north or south, which sounds.

419
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:47,420
 But in New York, I suppose that's easier than London, which has no grid system for most

420
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,420
 of it.

421
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:53,620
 Yeah, less easy than just saying across the city, red means stop.

422
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:56,780
 Why did they do they must have had a reason for splitting it up like that?

423
00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:00,820
 I don't know, I think it's because they aren't they use the same lights for people going

424
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,820
 in each direction.

425
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,820
 Wow.

426
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,860
 So when it was on the amber, these guys could go and when it was on green, these guys could

427
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,860
 go.

428
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:07,860
 But it was amazing.

429
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,860
 Mental.

430
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,860
 Good thing there were no diagonals in New York as well.

431
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:10,860
 What the hell do they do?

432
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:11,860
 That's true.

433
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,860
 Similar kind of thing.

434
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:17,900
 In London, the circle line on the underground used to be owned by two different companies.

435
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:22,140
 I, the clockwise bit was owned by one and the anticlockwise is owned by another.

436
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,260
 And you had to get a separate ticket from a different office.

437
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,620
 Sometimes the companies would try and sell you a ticket, so you'd go around 30 stops

438
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:32,180
 their way rather than go back three stops with the other companies.

439
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,180
 Wow.

440
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,340
 It sounds like journey planner on TFL.

441
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,180
 I can't have to take seven items of transport together.

442
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,180
 Who is Alex?

443
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:43,780
 Yesterday, who's saying that the most popular tube journey is Covent Garden to Leicester Square?

444
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,780
 Yeah.

445
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,780
 It's the most popular one.

446
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,780
 And the shortest.

447
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,780
 And the shortest one.

448
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:52,420
 Unless you take the anticlockwise route in which case it's been really pretty money's

449
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,420
 worth.

450
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,420
 Yeah.

451
00:18:54,420 --> 00:19:00,300
 During the cultural revolution in China, they wanted to change it so that green meant stop

452
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:04,380
 and red meant go because obviously red was a much more positive colour in those days.

453
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,380
 It's very strong colour.

454
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:10,980
 What about the cultural revolution, that fact about how they tried to kill all the sparrows

455
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,580
 because they were eating all the crops?

456
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,580
 Remember that?

457
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,580
 I think that was the great leap forward.

458
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,580
 Was it?

459
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,580
 Yes.

460
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,580
 It wasn't a mouth, yeah.

461
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,580
 So what did they do?

462
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:24,220
 There were like half a billion sparrows in China and they had a scheme where everyone

463
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,980
 was encouraged to kill them all.

464
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,020
 And so everyone killed all the sparrows.

465
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,020
 And then that's great because they're not eating the crops anymore, but they didn't realise

466
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:34,060
 that actually the sparrows were eating all the insects that were eating the crops.

467
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:38,140
 So they got rid of the sparrows and then all the crops died because they were eaten by insects

468
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,140
 instead.

469
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,140
 Fools.

470
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,900
 People never anticipate introductions and culling.

471
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,100
 People never seem to anticipate that natural knock on everything.

472
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,100
 Oh, exactly.

473
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,100
 Even though it happens every time.

474
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,540
 Yeah, I really like that guy who wanted to introduce to America every single bird mentioned

475
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,540
 in Shakespeare.

476
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,540
 Oh, yeah.

477
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,540
 And he introduced tons of them.

478
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,500
 And one of them is now the biggest pest in America.

479
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,500
 And I can't always say it is.

480
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,300
 Is it cross-guiling or something like that?

481
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,300
 Yes, something like that.

482
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,300
 Like a huge silence.

483
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,300
 Yeah.

484
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,300
 I have an amazing sparr effect.

485
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,300
 That's cool.

486
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,220
 Yesterday, I'm so glad this has come up.

487
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:09,220
 I read this in a Carl Sagan book, I was in foils and just flipped it open to random page.

488
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:15,260
 And it was that sparrows' testicles are a millimeter long and weigh one milligram.

489
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,260
 Oh.

490
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,940
 So I tweeted that yesterday.

491
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:23,380
 And K. Smolker, who is the natural history museum in Rotterdam's head curator, he got

492
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:28,340
 back to me saying that in April and May the sparrows' testicles will grow to the size of

493
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,340
 a kidney bean.

494
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,340
 Wow.

495
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,340
 A millimeter.

496
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,340
 Oh, my days.

497
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,340
 That's like, what's that?

498
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,340
 Like a thousand more times.

499
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,340
 Like a thousand more times.

500
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,340
 At a full moon.

501
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:46,140
 I read yesterday that on also on testicle news, not that was on the website.

502
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:50,340
 So I read that hippos can hide the testicles around their body.

503
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,340
 What?

504
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,340
 Like on their shoulder?

505
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,340
 Yeah, a pocket.

506
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,340
 Yeah, no.

507
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:58,780
 What they can do is they can retract them up to a foot inside their body.

508
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:02,940
 And the reason that they do it is because when hippos use to fight each other or when hippos

509
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,860
 do fight each other, they often go for the testicles.

510
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:10,500
 And so it's evolved as kind of an evolutionary way of moving the testicles out of the way.

511
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,140
 And it's a real problem if you're trying to castrate them.

512
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:18,260
 Can't believe hippos have beaten you guys to it.

513
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:20,140
 You've surely wished that you'd evolved them.

514
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,140
 Oh, W.F.

515
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,140
 Wrestlers do it.

516
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,140
 That's the one.

517
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,140
 Okay, right.

518
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:28,820
 Let's go back to Ian Fleming, because in one of his books, I think it's in "You only live

519
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,820
 twice".

520
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:33,860
 Bond's getting his instructions from Emma and Emma says, "Be careful of suma wrestlers in

521
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:37,460
 Japan because they can all withdraw their testicles into their body."

522
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,460
 What?

523
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,460
 Why be careful?

524
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:43,620
 Watch out for those testicle retractors who die of shock.

525
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:48,760
 They're going to some non-testicles where you expect to see them to respond, just to

526
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,760
 prepare yourself.

527
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,760
 But can they?

528
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,760
 I don't think you know that.

529
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,760
 So humans can't.

530
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,760
 No, but can't you?

531
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,800
 I've not tried, but I thought the idea was that they sort of shoved them into themselves.

532
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:05,880
 If I had a half hour with you, Andy, and I had a lot of the tournament lunch, but the

533
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:10,560
 fact that I'm kind of, we've slightly jumped past, which I love way more, is that hippos

534
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,920
 kick each other in the balls.

535
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,920
 No, it's okay.

536
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,920
 Bite, bite.

537
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,920
 Bite their balls.

538
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,920
 Oh, wow.

539
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:20,480
 Because if you think about it, it's a good, if you're fighting someone for sexual reasons,

540
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,400
 as in you're trying to get the lady, hippo.

541
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,400
 Yeah.

542
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,120
 And a good way of going against the guys to bite his testicles off because then he can't

543
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,120
 make with the female.

544
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,120
 Two birds of one stone.

545
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,880
 So you sort of cripple him and also?

546
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,880
 One bird, no stones.

547
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,880
 Two birds.

548
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,560
 I think we should maybe go back to traffic lights.

549
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,560
 Yes, sure.

550
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,400
 These are traffic lights.

551
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,840
 I was reading about the history of signs and when the two people who standardised signposts

552
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:48,760
 in the UK as pretty thrilling reading, were Jock, Kineer, and Margaret Calvert in the 1950s.

553
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:52,520
 But one of the things they were uproar about when they were standardising signposts was signs

554
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:56,800
 that usually been in capital letters and their proposal to put them in lower case, apparently

555
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,720
 caused outrage in the sign making a community.

556
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,720
 I'm sorry.

557
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,720
 I'm sorry.

558
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,720
 I'm sorry.

559
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,880
 They decided because it's easier to read from a distance because capitals can look all

560
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,720
 sort of the same if you're on a distance.

561
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,720
 Oh, that's good.

562
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,720
 And they were tasked to find the most boring font available to them, so it wasn't distracting

563
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,720
 for drivers.

564
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,720
 How was it they go with?

565
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,720
 And it's called motorist font.

566
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,240
 That does sound boring to be fair.

567
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:24,040
 I like the way that before they standardised it, they would have weird like signs.

568
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:28,560
 The sign for schools used to be a flaming torch of knowledge.

569
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,560
 It is.

570
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,560
 It's brilliant.

571
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,840
 I want to live in a country where those are the symbols.

572
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,840
 It's great, isn't it?

573
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,840
 Yeah.

574
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,080
 But imagine driving up the road and you see a flaming torch.

575
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,880
 The school is not the first place you think.

576
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,880
 Danger, fire.

577
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,880
 Turn around.

578
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,880
 I mean, actually, the sign for schools...

579
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,560
 The school of liberty straight ahead.

580
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:47,800
 The sign for schools now, the girl in that picture is, or children crossing, is based

581
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,200
 on the woman Margaret, who standardised the schools.

582
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,360
 Which I didn't know was based on her, because it's the most generic girl picture ever.

583
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,600
 Yeah, and the sign for farm animals is based on her family cow, which is called patience.

584
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,200
 So now we know that the cow on those farm signs is called patience.

585
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,200
 Wonderful.

586
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,640
 Alex, have you got anything to add?

587
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,920
 Yes, a couple of things very quickly.

588
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:13,200
 It was Eugene Sheeflin in 1890, who released a load of birds in Central Park.

589
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:19,320
 We were all matching in Shakespeare. He let bullfinches, chaffinches, nightingales and skylocks

590
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,320
 into the park.

591
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:25,680
 But it was the stallings that he released, which have now grown to about 2 billion massive

592
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,680
 pests.

593
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,840
 In British Columbia is the second largest breed of blueberries, and they just eat all

594
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,840
 the blueberries.

595
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:35,560
 It was in, you only live twice, that Bond was being taught how to be Japanese, and his

596
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,840
 teacher told him that similarsis can retract their testicles.

597
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,040
 But it's as far as I can tell, a complete myth.

598
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:44,560
 It's nothing like a thought artificially doing it or otherwise.

599
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:50,480
 Again, half an hour with me and Andy in a room.

600
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,320
 Okay, time for a final fact of the show.

601
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,000
 And that is you, Andy Murray.

602
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:01,720
 My fact is that there are companies which lasu icebergs to stop them hitting oil rigs.

603
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,720
 That's really good.

604
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,720
 How cool is that?

605
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,720
 That's very cool.

606
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,560
 So when you say lasu, do they do the cow boy thing if they just throw a rope at it?

607
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:11,680
 They just throw a rope and they say yeeha, and then they brand it which doesn't work because

608
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,680
 it melts.

609
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,680
 It melts.

610
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:19,800
 It's not exactly like the cow boy thing, but basically a ship circumnavigates an iceberg

611
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,800
 with a rope.

612
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,800
 See what it means?

613
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,800
 So it ties it on at one point.

614
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,720
 It goes around the circumference and then reattach it and just toes it.

615
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:29,240
 You don't have to toe more than a few degrees off course to ensure that it doesn't hit an

616
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,240
 oil rig.

617
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,240
 But it's really clever.

618
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:36,120
 And half the battle is in knowing where icebergs are and checking how they're floating.

619
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:41,320
 And so they observe the sky or they observe the sea rather from the skies and check what's

620
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,320
 moving where.

621
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:48,480
 If any icebergs do need to be moved, then they call a cow boy, and that started with the

622
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,480
 Titanic, didn't it?

623
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:53,920
 It was the fact that the iceberg hitting the Titanic led to them going, we need to monitor

624
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,280
 these things now.

625
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:59,680
 And they started putting in place the system that we now have to work out where they all

626
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,680
 are.

627
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,520
 The international ice patrol, which I just really like is a name.

628
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,520
 Fantastic organization.

629
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,520
 Yeah.

630
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,520
 It's good.

631
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,640
 But I like the fact that yeah, after the Titanic, they just a bunch of guys and boats were sent

632
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,840
 out to check where icebergs were.

633
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,840
 So I assume they just kept crashing into icebergs again.

634
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,840
 There's one here.

635
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,840
 Got another one.

636
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,840
 Got one.

637
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:20,480
 You know, they have a photo or two photos that they think potentially where it was the

638
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,440
 iceberg that the Titanic crashed into?

639
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,200
 It's got red paint along the side.

640
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,000
 So there's two icebergs that definitely had paint.

641
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,120
 And so the pictures were taken just for that reason because they thought, oh wow, how

642
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,120
 curious.

643
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:36,440
 I know that the Titanic incident had happened, which sounds weird, but true, the two boats

644
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,440
 were a German boat.

645
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,440
 They had no idea.

646
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:44,840
 I read an amazing article on Wired, which was a biography of the iceberg that hit the Titanic

647
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,440
 as much as you could speculate.

648
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,440
 They reckon it started in Greenland.

649
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:53,600
 Basically, every year, there's about 15 to 30 icebergs that are carved from the glaciers

650
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,680
 and they reckon only about 1% of those make it to the Atlantic.

651
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,440
 And then they gradually melt and so they eventually disappeared.

652
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,480
 So had the Titanic been going a few years later, it might not have been there at all.

653
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:09,160
 I kind of like the idea of the iceberg then going on to live a normal life with the

654
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,160
 eco-sexual husband.

655
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:18,320
 Well, it would also have been 3,000 years old because when it fell as snow onto the Arctic,

656
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,800
 it would have been packed and then very slowly moved out from the centre of it.

657
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:26,240
 That's an interesting life to have nothing happen for 3,000 years and then you run into the

658
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,240
 Titanic.

659
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,240
 Yeah.

660
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,240
 Yeah.

661
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,240
 Really?

662
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,560
 It was probably born as a iceberg roughly at the same time as Tutankhamun.

663
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,560
 Right.

664
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,560
 Yeah.

665
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,560
 That's so nice.

666
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,560
 So that was happening.

667
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:42,040
 And then it just found its way down to the Atlantic and eventually just hit really, really

668
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,040
 amazing.

669
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:47,960
 I guess it could be like, say, some sweat from Tutankhamun went up into the atmosphere.

670
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:52,960
 It turned into snow, fell down, waited there for 3,000 years and then hit the Titanic.

671
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,960
 Yeah.

672
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,640
 Which claim is that Tutankhamun sunk the Titanic?

673
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,640
 Whoa.

674
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,960
 That should be your fact on these.

675
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,960
 That was that conspiracy.

676
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,880
 Yeah, no, no, no, no, but that was the big thing that there was stuff from, it's a huge myth

677
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:09,440
 from back in the day that Tutankhamun's stuff from the Howard Carter finding was on the Titanic

678
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,440
 and it was the curse that brought it down.

679
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,440
 Yeah.

680
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,440
 Wow.

681
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,440
 You guys must know that.

682
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,440
 That was one of the classic childhood myths.

683
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,440
 The classic childhood myths.

684
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,440
 Yeah.

685
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,840
 Like, that was a children were told bedtime stories.

686
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,840
 Dan was told conspiracy theories.

687
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,840
 Okay.

688
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,840
 And it's cradle.

689
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,840
 Raised in terror.

690
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,840
 I think it is Dan.

691
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,840
 Little Dan.

692
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,080
 The lizards are behind it all.

693
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,320
 Sleep well.

694
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:33,080
 It is weird to think that, yeah, you might have molecules of water that were in the Titanic

695
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,920
 iceberg in you now.

696
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,160
 Do you guys know about the world's largest iceberg?

697
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,160
 No.

698
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,160
 No.

699
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:45,800
 It's about the size of Jamaica, the half the size of Wales and it calved off in the year 2000

700
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,160
 and they think that there's probably still bits of it that haven't melted yet.

701
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,160
 Wow.

702
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,160
 Was that an antogtic one?

703
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,160
 Yeah.

704
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,680
 It was called iceberg B15.

705
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,680
 Catchy.

706
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:59,720
 They don't have very creative names, icebergs, like hurricanes, they just, they have B50,

707
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,720
 D12, D14.

708
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,720
 D12?

709
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,720
 Do they rap a lot?

710
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,720
 They do.

711
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,720
 Yeah.

712
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,880
 I was looking at oil rigs.

713
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,760
 America's third largest oil field is LA and it's completely concealed.

714
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,320
 So if most oil fields you picture like those big pylons, LA is full of secret oil rigs.

715
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:21,160
 So LA started sort of hipifying around, I think, the 1930s and people who had built these

716
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,160
 huge oil rig buildings.

717
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:26,000
 The skies there's normal buildings in LA and they're all over Hollywood and there are

718
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,600
 just buildings all over LA which look like normal concrete buildings and inside they're

719
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,080
 sucking up, you know, hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil.

720
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,840
 For most of the transformers of the oil industry, aren't they?

721
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,840
 Towing an iceberg.

722
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,840
 Yeah.

723
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:42,280
 We've done some computer models to see if it's feasible to tow an iceberg from the Arctic

724
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:48,080
 down to Africa to give people drinking water and they think that you could take an iceberg

725
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:53,360
 from Newfoundland to the northwest coast of Africa, it would take five months and would retain

726
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,160
 more than 60% of the iceberg's mass.

727
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,800
 If it was the cheapest way, it might have been tried.

728
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,800
 They must be.

729
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,800
 They did try it.

730
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,800
 Well, did that was tried.

731
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,800
 Wow.

732
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,800
 Yeah.

733
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,360
 In the second half of the 19th century, smaller icebergs were routinely taken up to Peru

734
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,560
 for refrigeration in the brewing business.

735
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,560
 Oh.

736
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,560
 Over on the South Pole.

737
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,560
 Yes.

738
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,560
 Right.

739
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,560
 I see.

740
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,560
 So why do they keep them?

741
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:19,720
 In the harbor where they just have loads of icebergs.

742
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,120
 Must look so bizarre.

743
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:26,080
 It's not only icebergs that we're lassoing, NASA is investing in a project to lasso and asteroid

744
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:31,360
 using a robotic space lasso, to lassoing an asteroid into lunar orbit to make sure it orbits

745
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:36,640
 the moon so that it hopes that by 2025, we're going to be able to use it, astronauts will

746
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,920
 be able to use it as a way station from which to extract consumables on the way to Mars.

747
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,880
 That's like the worst idea I've ever had.

748
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:48,320
 We've already established that losing the moon would solve all our problems.

749
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,320
 And now we're saying, let's bring another moon.

750
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,320
 Yeah.

751
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,800
 A moon for the moon.

752
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,760
 Okay, that's it for this week's podcast.

753
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,760
 Thanks everyone for listening.

754
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,560
 If you want to get in contact with any of us, you can do so on our Twitter accounts.

755
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,960
 I'm on @Streiberland.

756
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,960
 James.

757
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,960
 @Xshaped.

758
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,960
 Alex.

759
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,960
 Alex fell under school.

760
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,960
 Andy.

761
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,960
 @AndreyHunterM.

762
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,960
 Ed Anna.

763
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:19,100
 Or you can go to our qi.com/podcastpage where she and Alex compile all of the extra stuff that

764
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:22,600
 we've been talking about from this episode and we're going to be back again next week with

765
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,600
 another episode.

766
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,600
 So stay tuned.

767
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,600
 We'll see you then.

768
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,600
 Goodbye.

769
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,840
 Okay.

770
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,920
 Everyone else has left apart from me and Anna with the only ones left in the office because

771
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:38,320
 everyone else has gone to Edinburgh, but if you want to see any of the guys in Edinburgh,

772
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,840
 you can see Andy.

773
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,840
 He has two shows.

774
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:45,920
 One is called ostentatious and the other is called Folly Adder and they are improvised comedy

775
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:51,440
 shows and Dan will be doing his one hour show, which is called Cuck Blocked From Outer

776
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,760
 Space and he will also be producing the Museum of Curiosity Life.

777
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:09,000
 So if anyone is in Edinburgh, then go and catch those.

778
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,580
 (upbeat music)
