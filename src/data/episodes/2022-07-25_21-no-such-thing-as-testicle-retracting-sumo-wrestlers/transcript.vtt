00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680
 We run it on QI a few years ago.

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.200
 Yeah.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.360
 And which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.680
 It's kind of nice, there's nothing as a fish.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.080
 No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.560
 He says it, right there, first paragraph.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.760
 No such thing as a fish.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:24.440
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.120
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.360
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with four other elves.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.400
 I've got Andy Murray, James Harkin, Anna Chisinski, and on fact checking duties, Alex Bell.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.840
 So once again, we've gathered around the microphone with our favorite facts from the last seven

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:39.840
 days.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.480
 And in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.960
 Anna, fact number one.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.720
 My effect is that made in Germany, product labels were originally intended to put people

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.960
 off buying the product.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.940
 It was a law pass in England in 1887, which forced foreign companies to put labels saying

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.960
 where the product had been made on their items, because British companies were worried about

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.500
 German knockoff products flooding their market and being cheap and tacky.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.260
 Typical inferior Germans.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.260
 Exactly.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.260
 The poor manufacturing base.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.620
 I'm terrible footballing students.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.280
 Baron, it was mainly to say the Sheffield cutlery industry, obviously it's ironic, because

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.500
 made in Germany very, very quickly became a stamp of very high quality.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.460
 So true fencer is German?

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.260
 It became popular during Nazi regime.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.500
 It wasn't invented specifically for it.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.980
 Oh, I thought Hitler commissioned it.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.020
 I thought he wanted like a German soft drink.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.020
 That's what people think.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.980
 But it became popular then, but it wasn't invented specifically by Hitler.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.340
 That would be surprising.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.940
 I find it very weird when countries decide that their products have to be patriotic or

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.840
 like, you know, the classic thing during the war in Iraq when America and France fell

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.840
 out.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.420
 Freedom fries became the thing.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.340
 I love the story of freedom fries because it was one guy, it was a Republican chairman called

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.340
 Bob Nay.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.700
 And he renamed the menus of three congressional cafeterias with freedom fries.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:05.700
 That's how it started.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.900
 And then it just spread from there.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:07.900
 Yeah.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.700
 And he didn't need to tell anyone about it because he has control over the cafeterias.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.380
 So he just said, this is happening, and so they changed it.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.380
 Isn't that amazing?

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.380
 He has control.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.380
 Yeah.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.380
 Fascistic.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.380
 In position of freedom based.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.380
 Yeah.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.860
 I did read a reference to supposedly French kissing a couple of real zealots decided they

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.860
 were now going to do only freedom kissing.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.020
 I don't think that caught on either.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.020
 I would say that.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.020
 Freedom toast as well for a French toast.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.220
 He also changed that on the menu, and that didn't get as much press.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.220
 I don't know why.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.220
 Freedom bread.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.220
 You can make a substitution for anything, which is French.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.100
 And you free the movie starring Gerard Depadieu, dawned freedom, of course, famously the comedian.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:51.140
 Apparently, the boycotted French is mustard, even though it's owned by a British company,

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.980
 and it's named after an American guy called Mr. French.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:54.980
 That's right.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.460
 He actually came out and said, please don't boycott us.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.820
 It's just a surname of our family.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.860
 Have you guys heard of Star Spangled Ice Cream?

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:02.860
 Yeah.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:03.860
 We heard this.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:04.860
 This is brilliant.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.300
 So it was conservative Americans had an ice cream company, and they gave their ice creams

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:17.220
 punning names. So for instance, the mint ice cream was called smaller government.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.380
 So can you guess what the chocolate ice cream was called during the bombardment of Afghanistan?

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:30.060
 Well, it was called chocolate or even better than vanilla ice cream was called.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.820
 I hate the French video.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.780
 But it's right to the point just back to the freedom fries thing very quickly.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:38.780
 It was really nice.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:39.780
 It was a counter.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.580
 So when people were doing the freedom fries thing, there was a cafe in Santa Cruz, which changed

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:50.220
 their menu of fries to impeach George W. Bush fries, which is really nice as nuts to

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.220
 that.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.420
 Speaking of labels, there were these American handbags, Tom Bin handbags, and they have

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.420
 washing instructions in English and French that were made during the Bush era.

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.340
 And the English ones are perfectly normal, and then when you read them in French, they

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.580
 say, do not bleach, do not dry and dry.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:05.580
 Do not iron.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:06.900
 We are sorry, our president is an idiot.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.900
 We did not vote for him.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:10.900
 That's great.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:11.900
 That's lovely.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.460
 In the first world war, there's exactly the same thing happened with all German name products

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.460
 in the USA.

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.460
 So Sauerkraut was called Liberty Cabbage.

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:25.500
 And that was renamed as a result of a delegation, but petitioning the Federal Food Administration,

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.780
 they said that Sauerkraut consumption had decreased by 75% since 1914 over the course

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:31.780
 of the war.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.340
 And they said, look, we've got 400 tons of it in New York alone on our hands.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.020
 Please rename it so that we can actually sell some of this stuff.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.020
 That's cool.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.020
 Yeah.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.620
 German measles became Liberty measles.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.620
 Yeah.

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:43.620
 I think some are fun to know.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.700
 Although that's sort of on the fringe of, you know, freedom kissing or whatever.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:52.300
 I was thinking about on Germany, because obviously Maiden Germany now is something that's associated

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.540
 with high quality.

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.780
 And in fact, the obverse to my original fact, which is that Maiden Germany was imposed

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:03.020
 on the Germans by the English, now the EU regulations are saying that labeling should

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.020
 be more accurate.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.700
 So if actually most of the work on a product has done in Bangladesh, and the most expensive

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.540
 part comes from India, then you're not allowed to say Maiden Germany, because you're a German

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:12.540
 company.

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:13.940
 And Germans are saying that's really unfair.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.180
 One of the reasons people buy our products is because it says Maiden Germany, because they're

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.180
 really good.

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.260
 Anyway, this is a long-winded way of saying German economy is great and maybe there's something

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.580
 to do with the fact that their word for borrow is the same as their word for guilt.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.980
 So they obviously have really, really good borrowing rates.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:29.980
 What?

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:30.980
 Personal borrowing is very low.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:31.980
 Because it's shameful.

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:32.980
 It's shameful.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.220
 So if you borrow, you have to say the word guilt.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.940
 That wasn't really round the butt way of talking about this.

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:39.940
 It was, wasn't it?

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:40.940
 It was.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:41.940
 Good.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.460
 I think I wanted to inform people about the EU regulation at the same time as rounding

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.460
 it off.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:47.460
 No one can say you didn't do that.

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.060
 I think I did.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.020
 So I was looking into Maiden China as a label.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:57.820
 I was really surprised by stuff that they produce 85% of all artificial Christmas trees

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:58.820
 are from China.

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:59.820
 Yeah, really.

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:04.780
 But other things that are made in China, the US uniforms for the 2012 Olympics.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:05.780
 Really?

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:06.780
 Yeah.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.540
 And also in 2008, police in China said they discovered a factory making free Tibet flags.

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:12.540
 Yeah.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:17.900
 But apparently the workers at the factory said they thought they were just making colourful

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:18.900
 flags.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.660
 They didn't know the significance of them.

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.980
 So the Maiden China label is exactly the same as Maiden Germany is in Japan, forced it

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:27.780
 on the Chinese to say to discourage people from buying Chinese products shortly afterwards.

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:28.780
 No way.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:30.860
 Quite like funny labels on stuff.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:35.900
 And I just remembered that the iPod shuffle when it first came out on its little safety labels

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.620
 said, do not eat iPod shuffle, which was useful.

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:47.340
 My sister bought a pram for her first kid Sophia and it was a huge box and on the side of

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.580
 the box it has a picture of a baby saying baby not included.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.660
 I can't tell if it was a joke or if it was, yeah.

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:54.660
 All right.

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:55.660
 We should wrap up on this one.

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.700
 Alex, have you got anything to add going back to soft drinks?

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:02.380
 Fanta was invented actually by Coca-Cola because they couldn't import their syrup into

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:03.380
 North Germany.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:09.180
 So they were trying to make up a drink using the leftovers that were available.

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:10.180
 Okay.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.300
 Time for fact number two.

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:16.820
 And that is my fact and my fact this week is in 1991, a professor at Iowa State University

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:20.940
 proposed that we could solve virtually every problem of human existence by blowing up

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:21.940
 the moon.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:22.940
 Not every problem.

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:23.940
 This is what he said.

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:27.420
 Not losing the remote.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:28.420
 I think that was included.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.380
 I think he went literally through.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:31.380
 Wow.

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.300
 So what problems are we solving and how?

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:38.580
 Well, the problems range from weather problems to famine, to disease.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:43.660
 Now, it has been pointed out by most scientists alive that this is not the case.

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:45.060
 It would not solve the problems.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:50.020
 In fact, NASA were saying that if we did blow up the moon, most likely part of the exploded

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:54.620
 moon would come back as a meteorite impacting on Earth and causing sufficient damage to

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:56.940
 extinguish, extinguish all life.

00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:01.380
 So actually, slightly the reverse effect of what he said, no, it kind of would solve all

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:02.860
 our problems to be gone.

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:04.380
 We wouldn't have any problems anymore.

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:05.380
 That's true.

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:06.380
 Yeah.

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:08.500
 He thought, and his name was professor Alexander Abyan.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.660
 His idea was that you would do it remotely from Earth.

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:13.900
 So you would put explosives into the moon and just push about and...

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.220
 When did he say that?

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:16.220
 1991.

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:17.220
 All right.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:18.220
 It's quite recent then.

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:19.220
 Yeah.

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.220
 Yeah.

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:22.220
 He's dead now, unfortunately.

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:24.660
 And his children say that he was a very sane man.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:25.660
 So this is not...

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:27.140
 This is not as if he was a lunatic.

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:29.900
 He was a very much loved mathematics professor at his university.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:34.460
 There have been a lot of wacky suggestions about how to save the world over the years, haven't

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:35.460
 there?

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:36.460
 Some of them you've got to admire.

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:37.460
 And apparently they...

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:38.460
 Some of them could work.

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:40.500
 So one idea is that we wrap Greenland up in a blanket.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:41.500
 You guys read this?

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:42.500
 No.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.500
 No.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:47.060
 So the problem is so all the... all the greeners' eyes is melting.

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:48.060
 That's obviously a bit of an issue.

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:53.300
 So in 2009, a bunch of geoengineers covered Greenland in this big, quite blanket.

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:56.660
 And there's meant to reflect the sun, so it means that the sun doesn't heat up and melt

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:57.660
 the ice.

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:01.300
 And it was surprising and successful, more successful than predicted, but it would cost about

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:04.380
 a trillion dollars to do it to the entirety of Greenland.

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:05.380
 Oh.

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:06.380
 Pretty weird.

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:09.780
 It's strange that putting a duvet on something would cool it down.

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:10.780
 Yeah.

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:11.780
 You would think it would just melt it.

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:12.780
 Mm.

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.460
 But in a hot country, if you go on, if you've got the sun blazing in on you and you've

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:16.460
 hide under a duvet here, think...

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:18.460
 Well, it's just not a very hot country.

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:19.460
 No.

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:20.460
 That's a fair point.

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:22.860
 So is the theory work or not?

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.980
 Yeah, it did work, but it's just that it's way too expensive to be at all feasible.

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:26.980
 Yeah.

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:32.500
 My favourite fact about Greenland is that until quite recently, 10% of the whole population

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.300
 lived in the same apartment block.

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:35.300
 What?

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:36.300
 No.

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:37.300
 One, one percent.

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:38.300
 Was it one percent?

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:39.300
 Yeah.

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:40.300
 It was something like 400 people out of 40,000, I think.

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:41.300
 Yeah.

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:42.300
 Something like that.

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:43.300
 Isn't that cool?

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:44.300
 Yeah, that's really good.

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:46.500
 It's called Block K, I think, or something like that.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.500
 Block P.

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.500
 I got that completely wrong, didn't I?

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.940
 I knew there was a fact in there somewhere.

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:55.060
 So, did we work out what kind of problems he was going to solve?

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:57.980
 It was one of those things where he kind of just made the statements.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:09:59.820
 He didn't publish a paper on it or anything.

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:04.420
 He just kind of loosely gave the territories and it was stuff like the weather pattern.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:05.620
 He didn't really go into it.

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:06.620
 Ties.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:07.620
 Ties.

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:08.620
 I've been cut off at high tide on a beach.

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:09.620
 Yeah.

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:10.620
 It's always a nightmare.

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:11.620
 That's going to stop.

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:12.620
 Yeah.

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:13.620
 Losing a remote.

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.620
 That was a big part of his decision, man.

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:18.020
 Would there be any tides left without the moon?

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:19.020
 Yeah.

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:20.020
 Because the sun does...

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:21.020
 Has tidal faucets...

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.020
 There are other tides as well.

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:27.300
 Yeah, it would mean that it would be high tide at midday every day, everywhere in the world

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:28.300
 where you were.

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:29.300
 If it was midday, it'd be high tide.

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:30.300
 Oh, that's so boring.

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.100
 It's like decimalisation, isn't it?

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:33.100
 So, no.

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:36.340
 All those tide timetables that I have to be reprinted as, actually.

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:39.300
 The crazy pound-shilling and pens world of the moon.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:40.300
 Yeah.

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:45.660
 The mollusks reproductive organs grow and shrink according to the phases of the moon.

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:48.660
 So, if there was no moon, would they stay big or stay small?

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.700
 It depends when you blew up the moon.

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:51.700
 Yeah.

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:55.780
 They'd be a powerful lobby from the mollusk community to blow it up when they were big.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:11:00.180
 Is that like the wind changing when the moon blows up your face?

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:01.180
 You'll be stuck that way.

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:04.780
 Your testicle will remain the same size forever.

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:06.260
 I think we shouldn't be too judgmental.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.220
 It should be because I think he...

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:09.220
 Abian?

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:10.220
 Is that what he was called?

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:11.220
 Yeah.

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:14.820
 When he died, he said, "Those critics who dismissed my ideas are very close to those

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:15.820
 who dismissed Galileo."

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:19.660
 And it was true, you know, when Galileo was thinking that.

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:23.580
 So maybe 300 years when the moon's just in shattered pieces across the universe.

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:26.060
 I don't think Galileo ever proposed blowing up the moon.

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:27.420
 It wasn't smart enough.

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.420
 For me, captain.

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:30.420
 It's such a cool...

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:35.100
 There wasn't plan to do a new clear explosion on the moon, wasn't there, by America, as

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:37.500
 a show of might to the Russians.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:38.500
 Wow.

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:39.500
 Yeah.

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:40.500
 It was like a PR exercise.

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:41.500
 Oh, that is fascinating.

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:43.300
 Sort of pointlessly exploding something.

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:44.300
 Yeah.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:45.300
 I mean, it wouldn't have blown up the moon.

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:46.900
 It wouldn't have just made a bit of a flash.

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:51.820
 The idea was the Russians would look up and go, "Oh my God, they blew up a bit of the moon.

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:53.700
 They must be a lot better than us, do you?"

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:55.700
 Oh, they've got terrible aim.

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:57.580
 Well, they're trying to hit us there.

00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:02.660
 They must have in Europe come on, they can't hit up them though.

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:09.140
 I, of course, have taken my head, because I know that is going to say something about yetis

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:10.140
 or vampires.

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:14.140
 No, it's my favourite book of recent times that I purchased, which is called Who Built

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:15.140
 the Moon.

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:20.700
 And it's a really lovely theory that the moon is artificial, because back when the rocks

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:25.780
 were originally brought back from NASA's Apollo 11 mission, the geologists who were studying

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:28.100
 the rocks said, "This says made in China."

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:34.940
 No, they said that basically the moon is just, "It's such a weird thing, the moon.

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:39.260
 The way it sits, the position it sits in, the perfectness of the distance between the

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:45.580
 sun and the earth, and just all the features that it allows for the tides and all that, it

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:51.340
 just, it's easier to prove it doesn't exist than to prove it does exist."

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:55.380
 There are people called eco-sexuals, do you know about these guys?

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:56.380
 No.

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:57.380
 What's going on?

00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:59.780
 Is it people who like having sex with the planet?

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:00.780
 Yes.

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:01.780
 In a way.

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:04.420
 There are people who have married the moon.

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:05.420
 Oh, wow.

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:09.220
 There were also people who married the earth, and they interviewed these people, and they

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:13.460
 said there were 450 others, and we're all married to the earth.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:16.340
 Has anyone had a divorce to the earth because they fell off of the moon?

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:17.860
 I don't think so.

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:22.820
 Because actually these people who married the moon and married the earth, they also married

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:26.220
 the Appalachian mountains and some snow in Ottawa.

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:27.780
 I'm tiring of these people.

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:31.580
 When they go to Spain later this summer, according to the news report, they plan to marry

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:34.340
 some hunks of coal in the city of Guizhoub.

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:40.940
 These people are alive now, so they're all sluts, basically, just putting themselves out

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:41.940
 there for an incentive.

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:45.780
 It's been the wedding ceremony, though, where you've got the person standing on one side

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:48.660
 of the altar and the entire earth on the other side of the earth.

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:53.180
 Where are the guests sit or a mountain range?

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:55.580
 You might now kiss the snow.

00:13:55.580 --> 00:14:01.300
 The wedding ended tragically early when the groom melted.

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:02.980
 So could we survive without the moon?

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:04.900
 Is that at all possible?

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:05.900
 I don't think so.

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:06.900
 I doubt it.

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:10.220
 There would be earthquakes, wouldn't there, and volcanoes?

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:16.220
 One theory is that the earth's rotational axis, as if it just disappeared, that the earth's

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:20.780
 rotational axis would go way off and provoke drastic climate change.

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:25.620
 Oh, yeah, because doesn't the moon stop us from wobbling like there's a natural wobble

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:29.460
 of planets, and because we have the moon, it steadies the earth, and without that I think

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:32.820
 it would cause dramatic climate change.

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:35.060
 We like what happens to Mars.

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:36.060
 Oh, really?

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:38.260
 I think so, like, as in we were done with no atmosphere.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.260
 We're so lucky to have the moon.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:41.260
 Yeah.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:42.260
 Thank you, moon.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.460
 And your friend, Dan, is trying to destroy it.

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:45.460
 I know.

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:46.460
 He wants to help.

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:51.300
 There's an amazing thing, and Alex, you'll probably have to help me find the proper fact

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:52.300
 about this.

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:56.540
 But there was a story about when Apollo 10 went around the backside of the moon.

00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.980
 So you know how you lose contact with the earth, because you can't get any signals.

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:01.980
 Yes.

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:05.860
 And so we're going to, on a regular day, it's like this terrible signal.

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:07.500
 So they have a few minutes behind the moon.

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:11.860
 And the astronauts in Apollo 10, as they were going around the moon, they started hearing

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:14.620
 this amazing orchestra, and they couldn't explain it.

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:19.060
 And what's really interesting is it's only recently that they've declassified these papers.

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:22.940
 And the conversation that they had was they were going, we can't tell everyone back on

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:26.460
 earth that we're hearing this because they just won't believe us.

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:29.700
 That will be our career over if we suddenly claim to hear this orchestra.

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.140
 Let them years to work out what it was.

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:36.780
 It turns out that it was a beam that was coming off from Saturn, I think it was.

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:39.100
 Alex, you might have to help me on that one there.

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:40.100
 I can fight.

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:44.020
 I found a video about the phenomenon and it obviously happened, but I can't find anything

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:45.420
 about an explanation.

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:49.500
 Eugene Sennon described it several times as an outer space-y style type music.

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:53.500
 He probably just swallowed his iPod Nano.

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:54.500
 Perfect.

00:15:54.500 --> 00:16:00.860
 I've seen a keen musician, I used a Glockenspiel player.

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:06.900
 He played a really fun prank in 1976 on April 1st, because obviously he did his radio program,

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:07.900
 what was it called?

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:08.900
 Sky night.

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:09.900
 Sky at night.

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:13.900
 But on April 1st, 1976, Patrick Moore told a radio audience that unusual planetary alignment

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:18.840
 would cause people on earth to weigh a little bit less at 947 in the morning, and if everyone

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:22.260
 jumped in the air, they'd experience a strange sensation of weightlessness.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:23.260
 Lots of people did it.

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.660
 And they immediately called up the radio to say, "Hey, it happened, I felt it."

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:28.140
 I was weightless for a second.

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:29.620
 People claim they actually levitated.

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:30.620
 That's great.

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:31.620
 It's such a good hoax.

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:32.620
 I love it.

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:36.860
 I like the fact that the first person to play golf, probably the only person to play golf

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:41.620
 on the moon, Alan Sheppard, missed it on his first attempt to kind of enjoy the fact that

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:42.620
 he missed the shot.

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:45.900
 To be fair, he was in a space suit, I guess it's hard to take a golf ball.

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:49.820
 One thing I really, really like is that when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin first landed

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:53.980
 on the moon, they just landed at NASA, got in touch with them and ordered them to eat a

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:55.460
 meal and go to sleep.

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:56.460
 Yeah.

00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:58.460
 Can you imagine having just landed on the moon and being told to go to bed?

00:16:58.460 --> 00:16:59.460
 It's happening.

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:00.460
 Yeah, it's happening.

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:01.460
 Can we get to the moon?

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:02.660
 This is what we need to do.

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:08.220
 We don't deserve to be contacted by at this point.

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:12.820
 Okay, time for fact number three, and that is James Harkin.

00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:19.660
 Okay, my fact this week is something I read on mentalfloss.com, and it is that in

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:26.020
 New York City until 1925, drivers going east or west stopped to the number light and drove

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:32.780
 on green, while drivers going north or south drove on the number light and stopped on green.

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:35.580
 So it was it was it like a traffic light that had no back?

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:39.540
 Yeah, you could see it from all different directions, so, but you'd have to know whether

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:42.900
 you're going east or west or north or south, which sounds.

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:47.420
 But in New York, I suppose that's easier than London, which has no grid system for most

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:48.420
 of it.

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:53.620
 Yeah, less easy than just saying across the city, red means stop.

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:56.780
 Why did they do they must have had a reason for splitting it up like that?

00:17:56.780 --> 00:18:00.820
 I don't know, I think it's because they aren't they use the same lights for people going

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:01.820
 in each direction.

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:02.820
 Wow.

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:05.860
 So when it was on the amber, these guys could go and when it was on green, these guys could

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:06.860
 go.

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:07.860
 But it was amazing.

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:08.860
 Mental.

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:09.860
 Good thing there were no diagonals in New York as well.

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:10.860
 What the hell do they do?

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:11.860
 That's true.

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:12.860
 Similar kind of thing.

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:17.900
 In London, the circle line on the underground used to be owned by two different companies.

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:22.140
 I, the clockwise bit was owned by one and the anticlockwise is owned by another.

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:25.260
 And you had to get a separate ticket from a different office.

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:28.620
 Sometimes the companies would try and sell you a ticket, so you'd go around 30 stops

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:32.180
 their way rather than go back three stops with the other companies.

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:33.180
 Wow.

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:35.340
 It sounds like journey planner on TFL.

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:38.180
 I can't have to take seven items of transport together.

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:39.180
 Who is Alex?

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:43.780
 Yesterday, who's saying that the most popular tube journey is Covent Garden to Leicester Square?

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:44.780
 Yeah.

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:45.780
 It's the most popular one.

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:46.780
 And the shortest.

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:47.780
 And the shortest one.

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:52.420
 Unless you take the anticlockwise route in which case it's been really pretty money's

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:53.420
 worth.

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:54.420
 Yeah.

00:18:54.420 --> 00:19:00.300
 During the cultural revolution in China, they wanted to change it so that green meant stop

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:04.380
 and red meant go because obviously red was a much more positive colour in those days.

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:05.380
 It's very strong colour.

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:10.980
 What about the cultural revolution, that fact about how they tried to kill all the sparrows

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:13.580
 because they were eating all the crops?

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:14.580
 Remember that?

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:15.580
 I think that was the great leap forward.

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:16.580
 Was it?

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:17.580
 Yes.

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:18.580
 It wasn't a mouth, yeah.

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:19.580
 So what did they do?

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:24.220
 There were like half a billion sparrows in China and they had a scheme where everyone

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:25.980
 was encouraged to kill them all.

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:28.020
 And so everyone killed all the sparrows.

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:31.020
 And then that's great because they're not eating the crops anymore, but they didn't realise

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:34.060
 that actually the sparrows were eating all the insects that were eating the crops.

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:38.140
 So they got rid of the sparrows and then all the crops died because they were eaten by insects

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:39.140
 instead.

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:40.140
 Fools.

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:41.900
 People never anticipate introductions and culling.

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:44.100
 People never seem to anticipate that natural knock on everything.

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.100
 Oh, exactly.

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:46.100
 Even though it happens every time.

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:49.540
 Yeah, I really like that guy who wanted to introduce to America every single bird mentioned

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:50.540
 in Shakespeare.

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:51.540
 Oh, yeah.

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:52.540
 And he introduced tons of them.

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:54.500
 And one of them is now the biggest pest in America.

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:55.500
 And I can't always say it is.

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.300
 Is it cross-guiling or something like that?

00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:58.300
 Yes, something like that.

00:19:58.300 --> 00:19:59.300
 Like a huge silence.

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:00.300
 Yeah.

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:01.300
 I have an amazing sparr effect.

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:02.300
 That's cool.

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:04.220
 Yesterday, I'm so glad this has come up.

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:09.220
 I read this in a Carl Sagan book, I was in foils and just flipped it open to random page.

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:15.260
 And it was that sparrows' testicles are a millimeter long and weigh one milligram.

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:16.260
 Oh.

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:17.940
 So I tweeted that yesterday.

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:23.380
 And K. Smolker, who is the natural history museum in Rotterdam's head curator, he got

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:28.340
 back to me saying that in April and May the sparrows' testicles will grow to the size of

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:29.340
 a kidney bean.

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:30.340
 Wow.

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:31.340
 A millimeter.

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:32.340
 Oh, my days.

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:34.340
 That's like, what's that?

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:35.340
 Like a thousand more times.

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:36.340
 Like a thousand more times.

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:38.340
 At a full moon.

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:46.140
 I read yesterday that on also on testicle news, not that was on the website.

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:50.340
 So I read that hippos can hide the testicles around their body.

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:51.340
 What?

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:52.340
 Like on their shoulder?

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:53.340
 Yeah, a pocket.

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:54.340
 Yeah, no.

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:58.780
 What they can do is they can retract them up to a foot inside their body.

00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:02.940
 And the reason that they do it is because when hippos use to fight each other or when hippos

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:05.860
 do fight each other, they often go for the testicles.

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:10.500
 And so it's evolved as kind of an evolutionary way of moving the testicles out of the way.

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:13.140
 And it's a real problem if you're trying to castrate them.

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:18.260
 Can't believe hippos have beaten you guys to it.

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:20.140
 You've surely wished that you'd evolved them.

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:21.140
 Oh, W.F.

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:22.140
 Wrestlers do it.

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:23.140
 That's the one.

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:24.140
 Okay, right.

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:28.820
 Let's go back to Ian Fleming, because in one of his books, I think it's in "You only live

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:29.820
 twice".

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:33.860
 Bond's getting his instructions from Emma and Emma says, "Be careful of suma wrestlers in

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:37.460
 Japan because they can all withdraw their testicles into their body."

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:38.460
 What?

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:39.460
 Why be careful?

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:43.620
 Watch out for those testicle retractors who die of shock.

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:48.760
 They're going to some non-testicles where you expect to see them to respond, just to

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:49.760
 prepare yourself.

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:50.760
 But can they?

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:51.760
 I don't think you know that.

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:52.760
 So humans can't.

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:53.760
 No, but can't you?

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:58.800
 I've not tried, but I thought the idea was that they sort of shoved them into themselves.

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:05.880
 If I had a half hour with you, Andy, and I had a lot of the tournament lunch, but the

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:10.560
 fact that I'm kind of, we've slightly jumped past, which I love way more, is that hippos

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:11.920
 kick each other in the balls.

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:12.920
 No, it's okay.

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:13.920
 Bite, bite.

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:14.920
 Bite their balls.

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:15.920
 Oh, wow.

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:20.480
 Because if you think about it, it's a good, if you're fighting someone for sexual reasons,

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:22.400
 as in you're trying to get the lady, hippo.

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.400
 Yeah.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:27.120
 And a good way of going against the guys to bite his testicles off because then he can't

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.120
 make with the female.

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:29.120
 Two birds of one stone.

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:30.880
 So you sort of cripple him and also?

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:31.880
 One bird, no stones.

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:32.880
 Two birds.

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:35.560
 I think we should maybe go back to traffic lights.

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:36.560
 Yes, sure.

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.400
 These are traffic lights.

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:42.840
 I was reading about the history of signs and when the two people who standardised signposts

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:48.760
 in the UK as pretty thrilling reading, were Jock, Kineer, and Margaret Calvert in the 1950s.

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:52.520
 But one of the things they were uproar about when they were standardising signposts was signs

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:56.800
 that usually been in capital letters and their proposal to put them in lower case, apparently

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:59.720
 caused outrage in the sign making a community.

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:00.720
 I'm sorry.

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:01.720
 I'm sorry.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:02.720
 I'm sorry.

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:05.880
 They decided because it's easier to read from a distance because capitals can look all

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.720
 sort of the same if you're on a distance.

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:08.720
 Oh, that's good.

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:11.720
 And they were tasked to find the most boring font available to them, so it wasn't distracting

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:12.720
 for drivers.

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:13.720
 How was it they go with?

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:14.720
 And it's called motorist font.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:18.240
 That does sound boring to be fair.

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:24.040
 I like the way that before they standardised it, they would have weird like signs.

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:28.560
 The sign for schools used to be a flaming torch of knowledge.

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:29.560
 It is.

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:30.560
 It's brilliant.

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:31.840
 I want to live in a country where those are the symbols.

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:32.840
 It's great, isn't it?

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:33.840
 Yeah.

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:36.080
 But imagine driving up the road and you see a flaming torch.

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:37.880
 The school is not the first place you think.

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:38.880
 Danger, fire.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:39.880
 Turn around.

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:40.880
 I mean, actually, the sign for schools...

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:43.560
 The school of liberty straight ahead.

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:47.800
 The sign for schools now, the girl in that picture is, or children crossing, is based

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:50.200
 on the woman Margaret, who standardised the schools.

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:53.360
 Which I didn't know was based on her, because it's the most generic girl picture ever.

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:57.600
 Yeah, and the sign for farm animals is based on her family cow, which is called patience.

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:01.200
 So now we know that the cow on those farm signs is called patience.

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:02.200
 Wonderful.

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.640
 Alex, have you got anything to add?

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:06.920
 Yes, a couple of things very quickly.

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:13.200
 It was Eugene Sheeflin in 1890, who released a load of birds in Central Park.

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:19.320
 We were all matching in Shakespeare. He let bullfinches, chaffinches, nightingales and skylocks

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:20.320
 into the park.

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:25.680
 But it was the stallings that he released, which have now grown to about 2 billion massive

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:26.680
 pests.

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:28.840
 In British Columbia is the second largest breed of blueberries, and they just eat all

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:29.840
 the blueberries.

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:35.560
 It was in, you only live twice, that Bond was being taught how to be Japanese, and his

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:37.840
 teacher told him that similarsis can retract their testicles.

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:40.040
 But it's as far as I can tell, a complete myth.

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:44.560
 It's nothing like a thought artificially doing it or otherwise.

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:50.480
 Again, half an hour with me and Andy in a room.

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:53.320
 Okay, time for a final fact of the show.

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:55.000
 And that is you, Andy Murray.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:01.720
 My fact is that there are companies which lasu icebergs to stop them hitting oil rigs.

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:02.720
 That's really good.

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:03.720
 How cool is that?

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:04.720
 That's very cool.

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.560
 So when you say lasu, do they do the cow boy thing if they just throw a rope at it?

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:11.680
 They just throw a rope and they say yeeha, and then they brand it which doesn't work because

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:12.680
 it melts.

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:13.680
 It melts.

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:19.800
 It's not exactly like the cow boy thing, but basically a ship circumnavigates an iceberg

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:20.800
 with a rope.

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:21.800
 See what it means?

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:22.800
 So it ties it on at one point.

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:25.720
 It goes around the circumference and then reattach it and just toes it.

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:29.240
 You don't have to toe more than a few degrees off course to ensure that it doesn't hit an

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:30.240
 oil rig.

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:31.240
 But it's really clever.

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:36.120
 And half the battle is in knowing where icebergs are and checking how they're floating.

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:41.320
 And so they observe the sky or they observe the sea rather from the skies and check what's

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:42.320
 moving where.

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:48.480
 If any icebergs do need to be moved, then they call a cow boy, and that started with the

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:49.480
 Titanic, didn't it?

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:53.920
 It was the fact that the iceberg hitting the Titanic led to them going, we need to monitor

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:55.280
 these things now.

00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:59.680
 And they started putting in place the system that we now have to work out where they all

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:00.680
 are.

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:03.520
 The international ice patrol, which I just really like is a name.

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:04.520
 Fantastic organization.

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:05.520
 Yeah.

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:06.520
 It's good.

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:09.640
 But I like the fact that yeah, after the Titanic, they just a bunch of guys and boats were sent

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:10.840
 out to check where icebergs were.

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:12.840
 So I assume they just kept crashing into icebergs again.

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:13.840
 There's one here.

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:14.840
 Got another one.

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:15.840
 Got one.

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:20.480
 You know, they have a photo or two photos that they think potentially where it was the

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:23.440
 iceberg that the Titanic crashed into?

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:25.200
 It's got red paint along the side.

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:27.000
 So there's two icebergs that definitely had paint.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.120
 And so the pictures were taken just for that reason because they thought, oh wow, how

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:32.120
 curious.

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:36.440
 I know that the Titanic incident had happened, which sounds weird, but true, the two boats

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:37.440
 were a German boat.

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:38.440
 They had no idea.

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:44.840
 I read an amazing article on Wired, which was a biography of the iceberg that hit the Titanic

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:46.440
 as much as you could speculate.

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:48.440
 They reckon it started in Greenland.

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:53.600
 Basically, every year, there's about 15 to 30 icebergs that are carved from the glaciers

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:57.680
 and they reckon only about 1% of those make it to the Atlantic.

00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.440
 And then they gradually melt and so they eventually disappeared.

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:03.480
 So had the Titanic been going a few years later, it might not have been there at all.

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:09.160
 I kind of like the idea of the iceberg then going on to live a normal life with the

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.160
 eco-sexual husband.

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:18.320
 Well, it would also have been 3,000 years old because when it fell as snow onto the Arctic,

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:21.800
 it would have been packed and then very slowly moved out from the centre of it.

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:26.240
 That's an interesting life to have nothing happen for 3,000 years and then you run into the

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:27.240
 Titanic.

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:28.240
 Yeah.

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:29.240
 Yeah.

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.240
 Really?

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:34.560
 It was probably born as a iceberg roughly at the same time as Tutankhamun.

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:35.560
 Right.

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:36.560
 Yeah.

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:37.560
 That's so nice.

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:38.560
 So that was happening.

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:42.040
 And then it just found its way down to the Atlantic and eventually just hit really, really

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:43.040
 amazing.

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:47.960
 I guess it could be like, say, some sweat from Tutankhamun went up into the atmosphere.

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:52.960
 It turned into snow, fell down, waited there for 3,000 years and then hit the Titanic.

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:53.960
 Yeah.

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:55.640
 Which claim is that Tutankhamun sunk the Titanic?

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:56.640
 Whoa.

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:57.960
 That should be your fact on these.

00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:58.960
 That was that conspiracy.

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:03.880
 Yeah, no, no, no, no, but that was the big thing that there was stuff from, it's a huge myth

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:09.440
 from back in the day that Tutankhamun's stuff from the Howard Carter finding was on the Titanic

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.440
 and it was the curse that brought it down.

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:12.440
 Yeah.

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:13.440
 Wow.

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:14.440
 You guys must know that.

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:15.440
 That was one of the classic childhood myths.

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.440
 The classic childhood myths.

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:17.440
 Yeah.

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:18.840
 Like, that was a children were told bedtime stories.

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:19.840
 Dan was told conspiracy theories.

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:20.840
 Okay.

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:21.840
 And it's cradle.

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:22.840
 Raised in terror.

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:23.840
 I think it is Dan.

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:24.840
 Little Dan.

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:26.080
 The lizards are behind it all.

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:29.320
 Sleep well.

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:33.080
 It is weird to think that, yeah, you might have molecules of water that were in the Titanic

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.920
 iceberg in you now.

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:37.160
 Do you guys know about the world's largest iceberg?

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:38.160
 No.

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:39.160
 No.

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:45.800
 It's about the size of Jamaica, the half the size of Wales and it calved off in the year 2000

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:49.160
 and they think that there's probably still bits of it that haven't melted yet.

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:50.160
 Wow.

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:51.160
 Was that an antogtic one?

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.160
 Yeah.

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:53.680
 It was called iceberg B15.

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:54.680
 Catchy.

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:59.720
 They don't have very creative names, icebergs, like hurricanes, they just, they have B50,

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:00.720
 D12, D14.

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:01.720
 D12?

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:02.720
 Do they rap a lot?

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:03.720
 They do.

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:04.720
 Yeah.

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:06.880
 I was looking at oil rigs.

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:11.760
 America's third largest oil field is LA and it's completely concealed.

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:16.320
 So if most oil fields you picture like those big pylons, LA is full of secret oil rigs.

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:21.160
 So LA started sort of hipifying around, I think, the 1930s and people who had built these

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:22.160
 huge oil rig buildings.

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:26.000
 The skies there's normal buildings in LA and they're all over Hollywood and there are

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.600
 just buildings all over LA which look like normal concrete buildings and inside they're

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:32.080
 sucking up, you know, hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil.

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:34.840
 For most of the transformers of the oil industry, aren't they?

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:35.840
 Towing an iceberg.

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:36.840
 Yeah.

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:42.280
 We've done some computer models to see if it's feasible to tow an iceberg from the Arctic

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:48.080
 down to Africa to give people drinking water and they think that you could take an iceberg

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:53.360
 from Newfoundland to the northwest coast of Africa, it would take five months and would retain

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:56.160
 more than 60% of the iceberg's mass.

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:58.800
 If it was the cheapest way, it might have been tried.

00:29:58.800 --> 00:29:59.800
 They must be.

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:00.800
 They did try it.

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:01.800
 Well, did that was tried.

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:02.800
 Wow.

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:03.800
 Yeah.

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:07.360
 In the second half of the 19th century, smaller icebergs were routinely taken up to Peru

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:09.560
 for refrigeration in the brewing business.

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:10.560
 Oh.

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:11.560
 Over on the South Pole.

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:12.560
 Yes.

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:13.560
 Right.

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:14.560
 I see.

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:15.560
 So why do they keep them?

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:19.720
 In the harbor where they just have loads of icebergs.

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:21.120
 Must look so bizarre.

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:26.080
 It's not only icebergs that we're lassoing, NASA is investing in a project to lasso and asteroid

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:31.360
 using a robotic space lasso, to lassoing an asteroid into lunar orbit to make sure it orbits

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:36.640
 the moon so that it hopes that by 2025, we're going to be able to use it, astronauts will

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:40.920
 be able to use it as a way station from which to extract consumables on the way to Mars.

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:43.880
 That's like the worst idea I've ever had.

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:48.320
 We've already established that losing the moon would solve all our problems.

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:50.320
 And now we're saying, let's bring another moon.

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:51.320
 Yeah.

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:52.800
 A moon for the moon.

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:56.760
 Okay, that's it for this week's podcast.

00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:57.760
 Thanks everyone for listening.

00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:01.560
 If you want to get in contact with any of us, you can do so on our Twitter accounts.

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:02.960
 I'm on @Streiberland.

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:03.960
 James.

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:04.960
 @Xshaped.

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:05.960
 Alex.

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:06.960
 Alex fell under school.

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:07.960
 Andy.

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:08.960
 @AndreyHunterM.

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:09.960
 Ed Anna.

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:19.100
 Or you can go to our qi.com/podcastpage where she and Alex compile all of the extra stuff that

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:22.600
 we've been talking about from this episode and we're going to be back again next week with

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:23.600
 another episode.

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:24.600
 So stay tuned.

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:25.600
 We'll see you then.

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:26.600
 Goodbye.

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:29.840
 Okay.

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:33.920
 Everyone else has left apart from me and Anna with the only ones left in the office because

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:38.320
 everyone else has gone to Edinburgh, but if you want to see any of the guys in Edinburgh,

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:39.840
 you can see Andy.

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:40.840
 He has two shows.

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:45.920
 One is called ostentatious and the other is called Folly Adder and they are improvised comedy

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:51.440
 shows and Dan will be doing his one hour show, which is called Cuck Blocked From Outer

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:56.760
 Space and he will also be producing the Museum of Curiosity Life.

00:31:56.760 --> 00:32:09.000
 So if anyone is in Edinburgh, then go and catch those.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.580
 (upbeat music)
