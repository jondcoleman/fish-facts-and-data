00:00:00,00:00:01,We run it on QI a few years ago.
00:00:01,00:00:02,Yeah.
00:00:02,00:00:04,"And which was, there's no such thing as a fish."
00:00:04,00:00:05,"It's kind of nice, there's nothing as a fish."
00:00:05,00:00:10,"No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life."
00:00:10,00:00:11,"He says it, right there, first paragraph."
00:00:11,00:00:12,No such thing as a fish.
00:00:12,00:00:24,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast"
00:00:24,00:00:27,coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:00:27,00:00:30,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with four other elves."
00:00:30,00:00:35,"I've got Andy Murray, James Harkin, Anna Chisinski, and on fact checking duties, Alex Bell."
00:00:35,00:00:38,"So once again, we've gathered around the microphone with our favorite facts from the last seven"
00:00:38,00:00:39,days.
00:00:39,00:00:42,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:42,00:00:44,"Anna, fact number one."
00:00:44,00:00:49,"My effect is that made in Germany, product labels were originally intended to put people"
00:00:49,00:00:50,off buying the product.
00:00:50,00:00:56,"It was a law pass in England in 1887, which forced foreign companies to put labels saying"
00:00:56,00:01:00,"where the product had been made on their items, because British companies were worried about"
00:01:00,00:01:04,German knockoff products flooding their market and being cheap and tacky.
00:01:04,00:01:06,Typical inferior Germans.
00:01:06,00:01:07,Exactly.
00:01:07,00:01:08,The poor manufacturing base.
00:01:08,00:01:10,I'm terrible footballing students.
00:01:10,00:01:15,"Baron, it was mainly to say the Sheffield cutlery industry, obviously it's ironic, because"
00:01:15,00:01:19,"made in Germany very, very quickly became a stamp of very high quality."
00:01:19,00:01:21,So true fencer is German?
00:01:21,00:01:24,It became popular during Nazi regime.
00:01:24,00:01:26,It wasn't invented specifically for it.
00:01:26,00:01:27,"Oh, I thought Hitler commissioned it."
00:01:27,00:01:30,I thought he wanted like a German soft drink.
00:01:30,00:01:31,That's what people think.
00:01:31,00:01:35,"But it became popular then, but it wasn't invented specifically by Hitler."
00:01:35,00:01:38,That would be surprising.
00:01:38,00:01:43,I find it very weird when countries decide that their products have to be patriotic or
00:01:43,00:01:48,"like, you know, the classic thing during the war in Iraq when America and France fell"
00:01:48,00:01:49,out.
00:01:49,00:01:52,Freedom fries became the thing.
00:01:52,00:01:58,"I love the story of freedom fries because it was one guy, it was a Republican chairman called"
00:01:58,00:01:59,Bob Nay.
00:01:59,00:02:04,And he renamed the menus of three congressional cafeterias with freedom fries.
00:02:04,00:02:05,That's how it started.
00:02:05,00:02:06,And then it just spread from there.
00:02:06,00:02:07,Yeah.
00:02:07,00:02:11,And he didn't need to tell anyone about it because he has control over the cafeterias.
00:02:11,00:02:14,"So he just said, this is happening, and so they changed it."
00:02:14,00:02:15,Isn't that amazing?
00:02:15,00:02:16,He has control.
00:02:16,00:02:17,Yeah.
00:02:17,00:02:18,Fascistic.
00:02:18,00:02:19,In position of freedom based.
00:02:19,00:02:20,Yeah.
00:02:20,00:02:26,I did read a reference to supposedly French kissing a couple of real zealots decided they
00:02:26,00:02:28,were now going to do only freedom kissing.
00:02:28,00:02:31,I don't think that caught on either.
00:02:31,00:02:32,I would say that.
00:02:32,00:02:33,Freedom toast as well for a French toast.
00:02:33,00:02:36,"He also changed that on the menu, and that didn't get as much press."
00:02:36,00:02:37,I don't know why.
00:02:37,00:02:38,Freedom bread.
00:02:38,00:02:39,"You can make a substitution for anything, which is French."
00:02:39,00:02:45,"And you free the movie starring Gerard Depadieu, dawned freedom, of course, famously the comedian."
00:02:45,00:02:51,"Apparently, the boycotted French is mustard, even though it's owned by a British company,"
00:02:51,00:02:53,and it's named after an American guy called Mr. French.
00:02:53,00:02:54,That's right.
00:02:54,00:02:56,"He actually came out and said, please don't boycott us."
00:02:56,00:02:59,It's just a surname of our family.
00:02:59,00:03:01,Have you guys heard of Star Spangled Ice Cream?
00:03:01,00:03:02,Yeah.
00:03:02,00:03:03,We heard this.
00:03:03,00:03:04,This is brilliant.
00:03:04,00:03:09,"So it was conservative Americans had an ice cream company, and they gave their ice creams"
00:03:09,00:03:17,"punning names. So for instance, the mint ice cream was called smaller government."
00:03:17,00:03:22,So can you guess what the chocolate ice cream was called during the bombardment of Afghanistan?
00:03:22,00:03:30,"Well, it was called chocolate or even better than vanilla ice cream was called."
00:03:30,00:03:33,I hate the French video.
00:03:33,00:03:37,But it's right to the point just back to the freedom fries thing very quickly.
00:03:37,00:03:38,It was really nice.
00:03:38,00:03:39,It was a counter.
00:03:39,00:03:44,"So when people were doing the freedom fries thing, there was a cafe in Santa Cruz, which changed"
00:03:44,00:03:50,"their menu of fries to impeach George W. Bush fries, which is really nice as nuts to"
00:03:50,00:03:51,that.
00:03:51,00:03:55,"Speaking of labels, there were these American handbags, Tom Bin handbags, and they have"
00:03:55,00:03:59,washing instructions in English and French that were made during the Bush era.
00:03:59,00:04:02,"And the English ones are perfectly normal, and then when you read them in French, they"
00:04:02,00:04:04,"say, do not bleach, do not dry and dry."
00:04:04,00:04:05,Do not iron.
00:04:05,00:04:06,"We are sorry, our president is an idiot."
00:04:06,00:04:09,We did not vote for him.
00:04:09,00:04:10,That's great.
00:04:10,00:04:11,That's lovely.
00:04:11,00:04:15,"In the first world war, there's exactly the same thing happened with all German name products"
00:04:15,00:04:16,in the USA.
00:04:16,00:04:19,So Sauerkraut was called Liberty Cabbage.
00:04:19,00:04:25,"And that was renamed as a result of a delegation, but petitioning the Federal Food Administration,"
00:04:25,00:04:30,they said that Sauerkraut consumption had decreased by 75% since 1914 over the course
00:04:30,00:04:31,of the war.
00:04:31,00:04:35,"And they said, look, we've got 400 tons of it in New York alone on our hands."
00:04:35,00:04:38,Please rename it so that we can actually sell some of this stuff.
00:04:38,00:04:39,That's cool.
00:04:39,00:04:40,Yeah.
00:04:40,00:04:41,German measles became Liberty measles.
00:04:41,00:04:42,Yeah.
00:04:42,00:04:43,I think some are fun to know.
00:04:43,00:04:47,"Although that's sort of on the fringe of, you know, freedom kissing or whatever."
00:04:47,00:04:52,"I was thinking about on Germany, because obviously Maiden Germany now is something that's associated"
00:04:52,00:04:53,with high quality.
00:04:53,00:04:57,"And in fact, the obverse to my original fact, which is that Maiden Germany was imposed"
00:04:57,00:05:03,"on the Germans by the English, now the EU regulations are saying that labeling should"
00:05:03,00:05:04,be more accurate.
00:05:04,00:05:07,"So if actually most of the work on a product has done in Bangladesh, and the most expensive"
00:05:07,00:05:11,"part comes from India, then you're not allowed to say Maiden Germany, because you're a German"
00:05:11,00:05:12,company.
00:05:12,00:05:13,And Germans are saying that's really unfair.
00:05:13,00:05:17,"One of the reasons people buy our products is because it says Maiden Germany, because they're"
00:05:17,00:05:18,really good.
00:05:18,00:05:22,"Anyway, this is a long-winded way of saying German economy is great and maybe there's something"
00:05:22,00:05:26,to do with the fact that their word for borrow is the same as their word for guilt.
00:05:26,00:05:28,"So they obviously have really, really good borrowing rates."
00:05:28,00:05:29,What?
00:05:29,00:05:30,Personal borrowing is very low.
00:05:30,00:05:31,Because it's shameful.
00:05:31,00:05:32,It's shameful.
00:05:32,00:05:36,"So if you borrow, you have to say the word guilt."
00:05:36,00:05:38,That wasn't really round the butt way of talking about this.
00:05:38,00:05:39,"It was, wasn't it?"
00:05:39,00:05:40,It was.
00:05:40,00:05:41,Good.
00:05:41,00:05:45,I think I wanted to inform people about the EU regulation at the same time as rounding
00:05:45,00:05:46,it off.
00:05:46,00:05:47,No one can say you didn't do that.
00:05:47,00:05:49,I think I did.
00:05:49,00:05:52,So I was looking into Maiden China as a label.
00:05:52,00:05:57,I was really surprised by stuff that they produce 85% of all artificial Christmas trees
00:05:57,00:05:58,are from China.
00:05:58,00:05:59,"Yeah, really."
00:05:59,00:06:04,"But other things that are made in China, the US uniforms for the 2012 Olympics."
00:06:04,00:06:05,Really?
00:06:05,00:06:06,Yeah.
00:06:06,00:06:11,"And also in 2008, police in China said they discovered a factory making free Tibet flags."
00:06:11,00:06:12,Yeah.
00:06:12,00:06:17,But apparently the workers at the factory said they thought they were just making colourful
00:06:17,00:06:18,flags.
00:06:18,00:06:20,They didn't know the significance of them.
00:06:20,00:06:23,"So the Maiden China label is exactly the same as Maiden Germany is in Japan, forced it"
00:06:23,00:06:27,on the Chinese to say to discourage people from buying Chinese products shortly afterwards.
00:06:27,00:06:28,No way.
00:06:28,00:06:30,Quite like funny labels on stuff.
00:06:30,00:06:35,And I just remembered that the iPod shuffle when it first came out on its little safety labels
00:06:35,00:06:40,"said, do not eat iPod shuffle, which was useful."
00:06:40,00:06:47,My sister bought a pram for her first kid Sophia and it was a huge box and on the side of
00:06:47,00:06:50,the box it has a picture of a baby saying baby not included.
00:06:50,00:06:53,"I can't tell if it was a joke or if it was, yeah."
00:06:53,00:06:54,All right.
00:06:54,00:06:55,We should wrap up on this one.
00:06:55,00:06:58,"Alex, have you got anything to add going back to soft drinks?"
00:06:58,00:07:02,Fanta was invented actually by Coca-Cola because they couldn't import their syrup into
00:07:02,00:07:03,North Germany.
00:07:03,00:07:09,So they were trying to make up a drink using the leftovers that were available.
00:07:09,00:07:10,Okay.
00:07:10,00:07:11,Time for fact number two.
00:07:11,00:07:16,"And that is my fact and my fact this week is in 1991, a professor at Iowa State University"
00:07:16,00:07:20,proposed that we could solve virtually every problem of human existence by blowing up
00:07:20,00:07:21,the moon.
00:07:21,00:07:22,Not every problem.
00:07:22,00:07:23,This is what he said.
00:07:23,00:07:27,Not losing the remote.
00:07:27,00:07:28,I think that was included.
00:07:28,00:07:30,I think he went literally through.
00:07:30,00:07:31,Wow.
00:07:31,00:07:33,So what problems are we solving and how?
00:07:33,00:07:38,"Well, the problems range from weather problems to famine, to disease."
00:07:38,00:07:43,"Now, it has been pointed out by most scientists alive that this is not the case."
00:07:43,00:07:45,It would not solve the problems.
00:07:45,00:07:50,"In fact, NASA were saying that if we did blow up the moon, most likely part of the exploded"
00:07:50,00:07:54,moon would come back as a meteorite impacting on Earth and causing sufficient damage to
00:07:54,00:07:56,"extinguish, extinguish all life."
00:07:56,00:08:01,"So actually, slightly the reverse effect of what he said, no, it kind of would solve all"
00:08:01,00:08:02,our problems to be gone.
00:08:02,00:08:04,We wouldn't have any problems anymore.
00:08:04,00:08:05,That's true.
00:08:05,00:08:06,Yeah.
00:08:06,00:08:08,"He thought, and his name was professor Alexander Abyan."
00:08:08,00:08:10,His idea was that you would do it remotely from Earth.
00:08:10,00:08:13,So you would put explosives into the moon and just push about and...
00:08:13,00:08:15,When did he say that?
00:08:15,00:08:16,1991.
00:08:16,00:08:17,All right.
00:08:17,00:08:18,It's quite recent then.
00:08:18,00:08:19,Yeah.
00:08:19,00:08:20,Yeah.
00:08:20,00:08:22,"He's dead now, unfortunately."
00:08:22,00:08:24,And his children say that he was a very sane man.
00:08:24,00:08:25,So this is not...
00:08:25,00:08:27,This is not as if he was a lunatic.
00:08:27,00:08:29,He was a very much loved mathematics professor at his university.
00:08:29,00:08:34,"There have been a lot of wacky suggestions about how to save the world over the years, haven't"
00:08:34,00:08:35,there?
00:08:35,00:08:36,Some of them you've got to admire.
00:08:36,00:08:37,And apparently they...
00:08:37,00:08:38,Some of them could work.
00:08:38,00:08:40,So one idea is that we wrap Greenland up in a blanket.
00:08:40,00:08:41,You guys read this?
00:08:41,00:08:42,No.
00:08:42,00:08:43,No.
00:08:43,00:08:47,So the problem is so all the... all the greeners' eyes is melting.
00:08:47,00:08:48,That's obviously a bit of an issue.
00:08:48,00:08:53,"So in 2009, a bunch of geoengineers covered Greenland in this big, quite blanket."
00:08:53,00:08:56,"And there's meant to reflect the sun, so it means that the sun doesn't heat up and melt"
00:08:56,00:08:57,the ice.
00:08:57,00:09:01,"And it was surprising and successful, more successful than predicted, but it would cost about"
00:09:01,00:09:04,a trillion dollars to do it to the entirety of Greenland.
00:09:04,00:09:05,Oh.
00:09:05,00:09:06,Pretty weird.
00:09:06,00:09:09,It's strange that putting a duvet on something would cool it down.
00:09:09,00:09:10,Yeah.
00:09:10,00:09:11,You would think it would just melt it.
00:09:11,00:09:12,Mm.
00:09:12,00:09:15,"But in a hot country, if you go on, if you've got the sun blazing in on you and you've"
00:09:15,00:09:16,"hide under a duvet here, think..."
00:09:16,00:09:18,"Well, it's just not a very hot country."
00:09:18,00:09:19,No.
00:09:19,00:09:20,That's a fair point.
00:09:20,00:09:22,So is the theory work or not?
00:09:22,00:09:25,"Yeah, it did work, but it's just that it's way too expensive to be at all feasible."
00:09:25,00:09:26,Yeah.
00:09:26,00:09:32,"My favourite fact about Greenland is that until quite recently, 10% of the whole population"
00:09:32,00:09:34,lived in the same apartment block.
00:09:34,00:09:35,What?
00:09:35,00:09:36,No.
00:09:36,00:09:37,"One, one percent."
00:09:37,00:09:38,Was it one percent?
00:09:38,00:09:39,Yeah.
00:09:39,00:09:40,"It was something like 400 people out of 40,000, I think."
00:09:40,00:09:41,Yeah.
00:09:41,00:09:42,Something like that.
00:09:42,00:09:43,Isn't that cool?
00:09:43,00:09:44,"Yeah, that's really good."
00:09:44,00:09:46,"It's called Block K, I think, or something like that."
00:09:46,00:09:47,Block P.
00:09:47,00:09:49,"I got that completely wrong, didn't I?"
00:09:49,00:09:51,I knew there was a fact in there somewhere.
00:09:51,00:09:55,"So, did we work out what kind of problems he was going to solve?"
00:09:55,00:09:57,It was one of those things where he kind of just made the statements.
00:09:57,00:09:59,He didn't publish a paper on it or anything.
00:09:59,00:10:04,He just kind of loosely gave the territories and it was stuff like the weather pattern.
00:10:04,00:10:05,He didn't really go into it.
00:10:05,00:10:06,Ties.
00:10:06,00:10:07,Ties.
00:10:07,00:10:08,I've been cut off at high tide on a beach.
00:10:08,00:10:09,Yeah.
00:10:09,00:10:10,It's always a nightmare.
00:10:10,00:10:11,That's going to stop.
00:10:11,00:10:12,Yeah.
00:10:12,00:10:13,Losing a remote.
00:10:13,00:10:15,"That was a big part of his decision, man."
00:10:15,00:10:18,Would there be any tides left without the moon?
00:10:18,00:10:19,Yeah.
00:10:19,00:10:20,Because the sun does...
00:10:20,00:10:21,Has tidal faucets...
00:10:21,00:10:22,There are other tides as well.
00:10:22,00:10:27,"Yeah, it would mean that it would be high tide at midday every day, everywhere in the world"
00:10:27,00:10:28,where you were.
00:10:28,00:10:29,"If it was midday, it'd be high tide."
00:10:29,00:10:30,"Oh, that's so boring."
00:10:30,00:10:32,"It's like decimalisation, isn't it?"
00:10:32,00:10:33,"So, no."
00:10:33,00:10:36,"All those tide timetables that I have to be reprinted as, actually."
00:10:36,00:10:39,The crazy pound-shilling and pens world of the moon.
00:10:39,00:10:40,Yeah.
00:10:40,00:10:45,The mollusks reproductive organs grow and shrink according to the phases of the moon.
00:10:45,00:10:48,"So, if there was no moon, would they stay big or stay small?"
00:10:48,00:10:50,It depends when you blew up the moon.
00:10:50,00:10:51,Yeah.
00:10:51,00:10:55,They'd be a powerful lobby from the mollusk community to blow it up when they were big.
00:10:55,00:11:00,Is that like the wind changing when the moon blows up your face?
00:11:00,00:11:01,You'll be stuck that way.
00:11:01,00:11:04,Your testicle will remain the same size forever.
00:11:04,00:11:06,I think we shouldn't be too judgmental.
00:11:06,00:11:08,It should be because I think he...
00:11:08,00:11:09,Abian?
00:11:09,00:11:10,Is that what he was called?
00:11:10,00:11:11,Yeah.
00:11:11,00:11:14,"When he died, he said, ""Those critics who dismissed my ideas are very close to those"
00:11:14,00:11:15,"who dismissed Galileo."""
00:11:15,00:11:19,"And it was true, you know, when Galileo was thinking that."
00:11:19,00:11:23,So maybe 300 years when the moon's just in shattered pieces across the universe.
00:11:23,00:11:26,I don't think Galileo ever proposed blowing up the moon.
00:11:26,00:11:27,It wasn't smart enough.
00:11:27,00:11:28,"For me, captain."
00:11:28,00:11:30,It's such a cool...
00:11:30,00:11:35,"There wasn't plan to do a new clear explosion on the moon, wasn't there, by America, as"
00:11:35,00:11:37,a show of might to the Russians.
00:11:37,00:11:38,Wow.
00:11:38,00:11:39,Yeah.
00:11:39,00:11:40,It was like a PR exercise.
00:11:40,00:11:41,"Oh, that is fascinating."
00:11:41,00:11:43,Sort of pointlessly exploding something.
00:11:43,00:11:44,Yeah.
00:11:44,00:11:45,"I mean, it wouldn't have blown up the moon."
00:11:45,00:11:46,It wouldn't have just made a bit of a flash.
00:11:46,00:11:51,"The idea was the Russians would look up and go, ""Oh my God, they blew up a bit of the moon."
00:11:51,00:11:53,"They must be a lot better than us, do you?"""
00:11:53,00:11:55,"Oh, they've got terrible aim."
00:11:55,00:11:57,"Well, they're trying to hit us there."
00:11:57,00:12:02,"They must have in Europe come on, they can't hit up them though."
00:12:02,00:12:09,"I, of course, have taken my head, because I know that is going to say something about yetis"
00:12:09,00:12:10,or vampires.
00:12:10,00:12:14,"No, it's my favourite book of recent times that I purchased, which is called Who Built"
00:12:14,00:12:15,the Moon.
00:12:15,00:12:20,"And it's a really lovely theory that the moon is artificial, because back when the rocks"
00:12:20,00:12:25,"were originally brought back from NASA's Apollo 11 mission, the geologists who were studying"
00:12:25,00:12:28,"the rocks said, ""This says made in China."""
00:12:28,00:12:34,"No, they said that basically the moon is just, ""It's such a weird thing, the moon."
00:12:34,00:12:39,"The way it sits, the position it sits in, the perfectness of the distance between the"
00:12:39,00:12:45,"sun and the earth, and just all the features that it allows for the tides and all that, it"
00:12:45,00:12:51,"just, it's easier to prove it doesn't exist than to prove it does exist."""
00:12:51,00:12:55,"There are people called eco-sexuals, do you know about these guys?"
00:12:55,00:12:56,No.
00:12:56,00:12:57,What's going on?
00:12:57,00:12:59,Is it people who like having sex with the planet?
00:12:59,00:13:00,Yes.
00:13:00,00:13:01,In a way.
00:13:01,00:13:04,There are people who have married the moon.
00:13:04,00:13:05,"Oh, wow."
00:13:05,00:13:09,"There were also people who married the earth, and they interviewed these people, and they"
00:13:09,00:13:13,"said there were 450 others, and we're all married to the earth."
00:13:13,00:13:16,Has anyone had a divorce to the earth because they fell off of the moon?
00:13:16,00:13:17,I don't think so.
00:13:17,00:13:22,"Because actually these people who married the moon and married the earth, they also married"
00:13:22,00:13:26,the Appalachian mountains and some snow in Ottawa.
00:13:26,00:13:27,I'm tiring of these people.
00:13:27,00:13:31,"When they go to Spain later this summer, according to the news report, they plan to marry"
00:13:31,00:13:34,some hunks of coal in the city of Guizhoub.
00:13:34,00:13:40,"These people are alive now, so they're all sluts, basically, just putting themselves out"
00:13:40,00:13:41,there for an incentive.
00:13:41,00:13:45,"It's been the wedding ceremony, though, where you've got the person standing on one side"
00:13:45,00:13:48,of the altar and the entire earth on the other side of the earth.
00:13:48,00:13:53,Where are the guests sit or a mountain range?
00:13:53,00:13:55,You might now kiss the snow.
00:13:55,00:14:01,The wedding ended tragically early when the groom melted.
00:14:01,00:14:02,So could we survive without the moon?
00:14:02,00:14:04,Is that at all possible?
00:14:04,00:14:05,I don't think so.
00:14:05,00:14:06,I doubt it.
00:14:06,00:14:10,"There would be earthquakes, wouldn't there, and volcanoes?"
00:14:10,00:14:16,"One theory is that the earth's rotational axis, as if it just disappeared, that the earth's"
00:14:16,00:14:20,rotational axis would go way off and provoke drastic climate change.
00:14:20,00:14:25,"Oh, yeah, because doesn't the moon stop us from wobbling like there's a natural wobble"
00:14:25,00:14:29,"of planets, and because we have the moon, it steadies the earth, and without that I think"
00:14:29,00:14:32,it would cause dramatic climate change.
00:14:32,00:14:35,We like what happens to Mars.
00:14:35,00:14:36,"Oh, really?"
00:14:36,00:14:38,"I think so, like, as in we were done with no atmosphere."
00:14:38,00:14:40,We're so lucky to have the moon.
00:14:40,00:14:41,Yeah.
00:14:41,00:14:42,"Thank you, moon."
00:14:42,00:14:44,"And your friend, Dan, is trying to destroy it."
00:14:44,00:14:45,I know.
00:14:45,00:14:46,He wants to help.
00:14:46,00:14:51,"There's an amazing thing, and Alex, you'll probably have to help me find the proper fact"
00:14:51,00:14:52,about this.
00:14:52,00:14:56,But there was a story about when Apollo 10 went around the backside of the moon.
00:14:56,00:15:00,"So you know how you lose contact with the earth, because you can't get any signals."
00:15:00,00:15:01,Yes.
00:15:01,00:15:05,"And so we're going to, on a regular day, it's like this terrible signal."
00:15:05,00:15:07,So they have a few minutes behind the moon.
00:15:07,00:15:11,"And the astronauts in Apollo 10, as they were going around the moon, they started hearing"
00:15:11,00:15:14,"this amazing orchestra, and they couldn't explain it."
00:15:14,00:15:19,And what's really interesting is it's only recently that they've declassified these papers.
00:15:19,00:15:22,"And the conversation that they had was they were going, we can't tell everyone back on"
00:15:22,00:15:26,earth that we're hearing this because they just won't believe us.
00:15:26,00:15:29,That will be our career over if we suddenly claim to hear this orchestra.
00:15:29,00:15:31,Let them years to work out what it was.
00:15:31,00:15:36,"It turns out that it was a beam that was coming off from Saturn, I think it was."
00:15:36,00:15:39,"Alex, you might have to help me on that one there."
00:15:39,00:15:40,I can fight.
00:15:40,00:15:44,"I found a video about the phenomenon and it obviously happened, but I can't find anything"
00:15:44,00:15:45,about an explanation.
00:15:45,00:15:49,Eugene Sennon described it several times as an outer space-y style type music.
00:15:49,00:15:53,He probably just swallowed his iPod Nano.
00:15:53,00:15:54,Perfect.
00:15:54,00:16:00,"I've seen a keen musician, I used a Glockenspiel player."
00:16:00,00:16:06,"He played a really fun prank in 1976 on April 1st, because obviously he did his radio program,"
00:16:06,00:16:07,what was it called?
00:16:07,00:16:08,Sky night.
00:16:08,00:16:09,Sky at night.
00:16:09,00:16:13,"But on April 1st, 1976, Patrick Moore told a radio audience that unusual planetary alignment"
00:16:13,00:16:18,"would cause people on earth to weigh a little bit less at 947 in the morning, and if everyone"
00:16:18,00:16:22,"jumped in the air, they'd experience a strange sensation of weightlessness."
00:16:22,00:16:23,Lots of people did it.
00:16:23,00:16:26,"And they immediately called up the radio to say, ""Hey, it happened, I felt it."""
00:16:26,00:16:28,I was weightless for a second.
00:16:28,00:16:29,People claim they actually levitated.
00:16:29,00:16:30,That's great.
00:16:30,00:16:31,It's such a good hoax.
00:16:31,00:16:32,I love it.
00:16:32,00:16:36,"I like the fact that the first person to play golf, probably the only person to play golf"
00:16:36,00:16:41,"on the moon, Alan Sheppard, missed it on his first attempt to kind of enjoy the fact that"
00:16:41,00:16:42,he missed the shot.
00:16:42,00:16:45,"To be fair, he was in a space suit, I guess it's hard to take a golf ball."
00:16:45,00:16:49,"One thing I really, really like is that when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin first landed"
00:16:49,00:16:53,"on the moon, they just landed at NASA, got in touch with them and ordered them to eat a"
00:16:53,00:16:55,meal and go to sleep.
00:16:55,00:16:56,Yeah.
00:16:56,00:16:58,Can you imagine having just landed on the moon and being told to go to bed?
00:16:58,00:16:59,It's happening.
00:16:59,00:17:00,"Yeah, it's happening."
00:17:00,00:17:01,Can we get to the moon?
00:17:01,00:17:02,This is what we need to do.
00:17:02,00:17:08,We don't deserve to be contacted by at this point.
00:17:08,00:17:12,"Okay, time for fact number three, and that is James Harkin."
00:17:12,00:17:19,"Okay, my fact this week is something I read on mentalfloss.com, and it is that in"
00:17:19,00:17:26,"New York City until 1925, drivers going east or west stopped to the number light and drove"
00:17:26,00:17:32,"on green, while drivers going north or south drove on the number light and stopped on green."
00:17:32,00:17:35,So it was it was it like a traffic light that had no back?
00:17:35,00:17:39,"Yeah, you could see it from all different directions, so, but you'd have to know whether"
00:17:39,00:17:42,"you're going east or west or north or south, which sounds."
00:17:42,00:17:47,"But in New York, I suppose that's easier than London, which has no grid system for most"
00:17:47,00:17:48,of it.
00:17:48,00:17:53,"Yeah, less easy than just saying across the city, red means stop."
00:17:53,00:17:56,Why did they do they must have had a reason for splitting it up like that?
00:17:56,00:18:00,"I don't know, I think it's because they aren't they use the same lights for people going"
00:18:00,00:18:01,in each direction.
00:18:01,00:18:02,Wow.
00:18:02,00:18:05,"So when it was on the amber, these guys could go and when it was on green, these guys could"
00:18:05,00:18:06,go.
00:18:06,00:18:07,But it was amazing.
00:18:07,00:18:08,Mental.
00:18:08,00:18:09,Good thing there were no diagonals in New York as well.
00:18:09,00:18:10,What the hell do they do?
00:18:10,00:18:11,That's true.
00:18:11,00:18:12,Similar kind of thing.
00:18:12,00:18:17,"In London, the circle line on the underground used to be owned by two different companies."
00:18:17,00:18:22,"I, the clockwise bit was owned by one and the anticlockwise is owned by another."
00:18:22,00:18:25,And you had to get a separate ticket from a different office.
00:18:25,00:18:28,"Sometimes the companies would try and sell you a ticket, so you'd go around 30 stops"
00:18:28,00:18:32,their way rather than go back three stops with the other companies.
00:18:32,00:18:33,Wow.
00:18:33,00:18:35,It sounds like journey planner on TFL.
00:18:35,00:18:38,I can't have to take seven items of transport together.
00:18:38,00:18:39,Who is Alex?
00:18:39,00:18:43,"Yesterday, who's saying that the most popular tube journey is Covent Garden to Leicester Square?"
00:18:43,00:18:44,Yeah.
00:18:44,00:18:45,It's the most popular one.
00:18:45,00:18:46,And the shortest.
00:18:46,00:18:47,And the shortest one.
00:18:47,00:18:52,Unless you take the anticlockwise route in which case it's been really pretty money's
00:18:52,00:18:53,worth.
00:18:53,00:18:54,Yeah.
00:18:54,00:19:00,"During the cultural revolution in China, they wanted to change it so that green meant stop"
00:19:00,00:19:04,and red meant go because obviously red was a much more positive colour in those days.
00:19:04,00:19:05,It's very strong colour.
00:19:05,00:19:10,"What about the cultural revolution, that fact about how they tried to kill all the sparrows"
00:19:10,00:19:13,because they were eating all the crops?
00:19:13,00:19:14,Remember that?
00:19:14,00:19:15,I think that was the great leap forward.
00:19:15,00:19:16,Was it?
00:19:16,00:19:17,Yes.
00:19:17,00:19:18,"It wasn't a mouth, yeah."
00:19:18,00:19:19,So what did they do?
00:19:19,00:19:24,There were like half a billion sparrows in China and they had a scheme where everyone
00:19:24,00:19:25,was encouraged to kill them all.
00:19:25,00:19:28,And so everyone killed all the sparrows.
00:19:28,00:19:31,"And then that's great because they're not eating the crops anymore, but they didn't realise"
00:19:31,00:19:34,that actually the sparrows were eating all the insects that were eating the crops.
00:19:34,00:19:38,So they got rid of the sparrows and then all the crops died because they were eaten by insects
00:19:38,00:19:39,instead.
00:19:39,00:19:40,Fools.
00:19:40,00:19:41,People never anticipate introductions and culling.
00:19:41,00:19:44,People never seem to anticipate that natural knock on everything.
00:19:44,00:19:45,"Oh, exactly."
00:19:45,00:19:46,Even though it happens every time.
00:19:46,00:19:49,"Yeah, I really like that guy who wanted to introduce to America every single bird mentioned"
00:19:49,00:19:50,in Shakespeare.
00:19:50,00:19:51,"Oh, yeah."
00:19:51,00:19:52,And he introduced tons of them.
00:19:52,00:19:54,And one of them is now the biggest pest in America.
00:19:54,00:19:55,And I can't always say it is.
00:19:55,00:19:57,Is it cross-guiling or something like that?
00:19:57,00:19:58,"Yes, something like that."
00:19:58,00:19:59,Like a huge silence.
00:19:59,00:20:00,Yeah.
00:20:00,00:20:01,I have an amazing sparr effect.
00:20:01,00:20:02,That's cool.
00:20:02,00:20:04,"Yesterday, I'm so glad this has come up."
00:20:04,00:20:09,"I read this in a Carl Sagan book, I was in foils and just flipped it open to random page."
00:20:09,00:20:15,And it was that sparrows' testicles are a millimeter long and weigh one milligram.
00:20:15,00:20:16,Oh.
00:20:16,00:20:17,So I tweeted that yesterday.
00:20:17,00:20:23,"And K. Smolker, who is the natural history museum in Rotterdam's head curator, he got"
00:20:23,00:20:28,back to me saying that in April and May the sparrows' testicles will grow to the size of
00:20:28,00:20:29,a kidney bean.
00:20:29,00:20:30,Wow.
00:20:30,00:20:31,A millimeter.
00:20:31,00:20:32,"Oh, my days."
00:20:32,00:20:34,"That's like, what's that?"
00:20:34,00:20:35,Like a thousand more times.
00:20:35,00:20:36,Like a thousand more times.
00:20:36,00:20:38,At a full moon.
00:20:38,00:20:46,"I read yesterday that on also on testicle news, not that was on the website."
00:20:46,00:20:50,So I read that hippos can hide the testicles around their body.
00:20:50,00:20:51,What?
00:20:51,00:20:52,Like on their shoulder?
00:20:52,00:20:53,"Yeah, a pocket."
00:20:53,00:20:54,"Yeah, no."
00:20:54,00:20:58,What they can do is they can retract them up to a foot inside their body.
00:20:58,00:21:02,And the reason that they do it is because when hippos use to fight each other or when hippos
00:21:02,00:21:05,"do fight each other, they often go for the testicles."
00:21:05,00:21:10,And so it's evolved as kind of an evolutionary way of moving the testicles out of the way.
00:21:10,00:21:13,And it's a real problem if you're trying to castrate them.
00:21:13,00:21:18,Can't believe hippos have beaten you guys to it.
00:21:18,00:21:20,You've surely wished that you'd evolved them.
00:21:20,00:21:21,"Oh, W.F."
00:21:21,00:21:22,Wrestlers do it.
00:21:22,00:21:23,That's the one.
00:21:23,00:21:24,"Okay, right."
00:21:24,00:21:28,"Let's go back to Ian Fleming, because in one of his books, I think it's in ""You only live"
00:21:28,00:21:29,"twice""."
00:21:29,00:21:33,"Bond's getting his instructions from Emma and Emma says, ""Be careful of suma wrestlers in"
00:21:33,00:21:37,"Japan because they can all withdraw their testicles into their body."""
00:21:37,00:21:38,What?
00:21:38,00:21:39,Why be careful?
00:21:39,00:21:43,Watch out for those testicle retractors who die of shock.
00:21:43,00:21:48,"They're going to some non-testicles where you expect to see them to respond, just to"
00:21:48,00:21:49,prepare yourself.
00:21:49,00:21:50,But can they?
00:21:50,00:21:51,I don't think you know that.
00:21:51,00:21:52,So humans can't.
00:21:52,00:21:53,"No, but can't you?"
00:21:53,00:21:58,"I've not tried, but I thought the idea was that they sort of shoved them into themselves."
00:21:58,00:22:05,"If I had a half hour with you, Andy, and I had a lot of the tournament lunch, but the"
00:22:05,00:22:10,"fact that I'm kind of, we've slightly jumped past, which I love way more, is that hippos"
00:22:10,00:22:11,kick each other in the balls.
00:22:11,00:22:12,"No, it's okay."
00:22:12,00:22:13,"Bite, bite."
00:22:13,00:22:14,Bite their balls.
00:22:14,00:22:15,"Oh, wow."
00:22:15,00:22:20,"Because if you think about it, it's a good, if you're fighting someone for sexual reasons,"
00:22:20,00:22:22,"as in you're trying to get the lady, hippo."
00:22:22,00:22:23,Yeah.
00:22:23,00:22:27,And a good way of going against the guys to bite his testicles off because then he can't
00:22:27,00:22:28,make with the female.
00:22:28,00:22:29,Two birds of one stone.
00:22:29,00:22:30,So you sort of cripple him and also?
00:22:30,00:22:31,"One bird, no stones."
00:22:31,00:22:32,Two birds.
00:22:32,00:22:35,I think we should maybe go back to traffic lights.
00:22:35,00:22:36,"Yes, sure."
00:22:36,00:22:38,These are traffic lights.
00:22:38,00:22:42,I was reading about the history of signs and when the two people who standardised signposts
00:22:42,00:22:48,"in the UK as pretty thrilling reading, were Jock, Kineer, and Margaret Calvert in the 1950s."
00:22:48,00:22:52,But one of the things they were uproar about when they were standardising signposts was signs
00:22:52,00:22:56,"that usually been in capital letters and their proposal to put them in lower case, apparently"
00:22:56,00:22:59,caused outrage in the sign making a community.
00:22:59,00:23:00,I'm sorry.
00:23:00,00:23:01,I'm sorry.
00:23:01,00:23:02,I'm sorry.
00:23:02,00:23:05,They decided because it's easier to read from a distance because capitals can look all
00:23:05,00:23:07,sort of the same if you're on a distance.
00:23:07,00:23:08,"Oh, that's good."
00:23:08,00:23:11,"And they were tasked to find the most boring font available to them, so it wasn't distracting"
00:23:11,00:23:12,for drivers.
00:23:12,00:23:13,How was it they go with?
00:23:13,00:23:14,And it's called motorist font.
00:23:14,00:23:18,That does sound boring to be fair.
00:23:18,00:23:24,"I like the way that before they standardised it, they would have weird like signs."
00:23:24,00:23:28,The sign for schools used to be a flaming torch of knowledge.
00:23:28,00:23:29,It is.
00:23:29,00:23:30,It's brilliant.
00:23:30,00:23:31,I want to live in a country where those are the symbols.
00:23:31,00:23:32,"It's great, isn't it?"
00:23:32,00:23:33,Yeah.
00:23:33,00:23:36,But imagine driving up the road and you see a flaming torch.
00:23:36,00:23:37,The school is not the first place you think.
00:23:37,00:23:38,"Danger, fire."
00:23:38,00:23:39,Turn around.
00:23:39,00:23:40,"I mean, actually, the sign for schools..."
00:23:40,00:23:43,The school of liberty straight ahead.
00:23:43,00:23:47,"The sign for schools now, the girl in that picture is, or children crossing, is based"
00:23:47,00:23:50,"on the woman Margaret, who standardised the schools."
00:23:50,00:23:53,"Which I didn't know was based on her, because it's the most generic girl picture ever."
00:23:53,00:23:57,"Yeah, and the sign for farm animals is based on her family cow, which is called patience."
00:23:57,00:24:01,So now we know that the cow on those farm signs is called patience.
00:24:01,00:24:02,Wonderful.
00:24:02,00:24:04,"Alex, have you got anything to add?"
00:24:04,00:24:06,"Yes, a couple of things very quickly."
00:24:06,00:24:13,"It was Eugene Sheeflin in 1890, who released a load of birds in Central Park."
00:24:13,00:24:19,"We were all matching in Shakespeare. He let bullfinches, chaffinches, nightingales and skylocks"
00:24:19,00:24:20,into the park.
00:24:20,00:24:25,"But it was the stallings that he released, which have now grown to about 2 billion massive"
00:24:25,00:24:26,pests.
00:24:26,00:24:28,"In British Columbia is the second largest breed of blueberries, and they just eat all"
00:24:28,00:24:29,the blueberries.
00:24:29,00:24:35,"It was in, you only live twice, that Bond was being taught how to be Japanese, and his"
00:24:35,00:24:37,teacher told him that similarsis can retract their testicles.
00:24:37,00:24:40,"But it's as far as I can tell, a complete myth."
00:24:40,00:24:44,It's nothing like a thought artificially doing it or otherwise.
00:24:44,00:24:50,"Again, half an hour with me and Andy in a room."
00:24:50,00:24:53,"Okay, time for a final fact of the show."
00:24:53,00:24:55,"And that is you, Andy Murray."
00:24:55,00:25:01,My fact is that there are companies which lasu icebergs to stop them hitting oil rigs.
00:25:01,00:25:02,That's really good.
00:25:02,00:25:03,How cool is that?
00:25:03,00:25:04,That's very cool.
00:25:04,00:25:07,"So when you say lasu, do they do the cow boy thing if they just throw a rope at it?"
00:25:07,00:25:11,"They just throw a rope and they say yeeha, and then they brand it which doesn't work because"
00:25:11,00:25:12,it melts.
00:25:12,00:25:13,It melts.
00:25:13,00:25:19,"It's not exactly like the cow boy thing, but basically a ship circumnavigates an iceberg"
00:25:19,00:25:20,with a rope.
00:25:20,00:25:21,See what it means?
00:25:21,00:25:22,So it ties it on at one point.
00:25:22,00:25:25,It goes around the circumference and then reattach it and just toes it.
00:25:25,00:25:29,You don't have to toe more than a few degrees off course to ensure that it doesn't hit an
00:25:29,00:25:30,oil rig.
00:25:30,00:25:31,But it's really clever.
00:25:31,00:25:36,And half the battle is in knowing where icebergs are and checking how they're floating.
00:25:36,00:25:41,And so they observe the sky or they observe the sea rather from the skies and check what's
00:25:41,00:25:42,moving where.
00:25:42,00:25:48,"If any icebergs do need to be moved, then they call a cow boy, and that started with the"
00:25:48,00:25:49,"Titanic, didn't it?"
00:25:49,00:25:53,"It was the fact that the iceberg hitting the Titanic led to them going, we need to monitor"
00:25:53,00:25:55,these things now.
00:25:55,00:25:59,And they started putting in place the system that we now have to work out where they all
00:25:59,00:26:00,are.
00:26:00,00:26:03,"The international ice patrol, which I just really like is a name."
00:26:03,00:26:04,Fantastic organization.
00:26:04,00:26:05,Yeah.
00:26:05,00:26:06,It's good.
00:26:06,00:26:09,"But I like the fact that yeah, after the Titanic, they just a bunch of guys and boats were sent"
00:26:09,00:26:10,out to check where icebergs were.
00:26:10,00:26:12,So I assume they just kept crashing into icebergs again.
00:26:12,00:26:13,There's one here.
00:26:13,00:26:14,Got another one.
00:26:14,00:26:15,Got one.
00:26:15,00:26:20,"You know, they have a photo or two photos that they think potentially where it was the"
00:26:20,00:26:23,iceberg that the Titanic crashed into?
00:26:23,00:26:25,It's got red paint along the side.
00:26:25,00:26:27,So there's two icebergs that definitely had paint.
00:26:27,00:26:31,"And so the pictures were taken just for that reason because they thought, oh wow, how"
00:26:31,00:26:32,curious.
00:26:32,00:26:36,"I know that the Titanic incident had happened, which sounds weird, but true, the two boats"
00:26:36,00:26:37,were a German boat.
00:26:37,00:26:38,They had no idea.
00:26:38,00:26:44,"I read an amazing article on Wired, which was a biography of the iceberg that hit the Titanic"
00:26:44,00:26:46,as much as you could speculate.
00:26:46,00:26:48,They reckon it started in Greenland.
00:26:48,00:26:53,"Basically, every year, there's about 15 to 30 icebergs that are carved from the glaciers"
00:26:53,00:26:57,and they reckon only about 1% of those make it to the Atlantic.
00:26:57,00:27:00,And then they gradually melt and so they eventually disappeared.
00:27:00,00:27:03,"So had the Titanic been going a few years later, it might not have been there at all."
00:27:03,00:27:09,I kind of like the idea of the iceberg then going on to live a normal life with the
00:27:09,00:27:11,eco-sexual husband.
00:27:11,00:27:18,"Well, it would also have been 3,000 years old because when it fell as snow onto the Arctic,"
00:27:18,00:27:21,it would have been packed and then very slowly moved out from the centre of it.
00:27:21,00:27:26,"That's an interesting life to have nothing happen for 3,000 years and then you run into the"
00:27:26,00:27:27,Titanic.
00:27:27,00:27:28,Yeah.
00:27:28,00:27:29,Yeah.
00:27:29,00:27:30,Really?
00:27:30,00:27:34,It was probably born as a iceberg roughly at the same time as Tutankhamun.
00:27:34,00:27:35,Right.
00:27:35,00:27:36,Yeah.
00:27:36,00:27:37,That's so nice.
00:27:37,00:27:38,So that was happening.
00:27:38,00:27:42,"And then it just found its way down to the Atlantic and eventually just hit really, really"
00:27:42,00:27:43,amazing.
00:27:43,00:27:47,"I guess it could be like, say, some sweat from Tutankhamun went up into the atmosphere."
00:27:47,00:27:52,"It turned into snow, fell down, waited there for 3,000 years and then hit the Titanic."
00:27:52,00:27:53,Yeah.
00:27:53,00:27:55,Which claim is that Tutankhamun sunk the Titanic?
00:27:55,00:27:56,Whoa.
00:27:56,00:27:57,That should be your fact on these.
00:27:57,00:27:58,That was that conspiracy.
00:27:58,00:28:03,"Yeah, no, no, no, no, but that was the big thing that there was stuff from, it's a huge myth"
00:28:03,00:28:09,from back in the day that Tutankhamun's stuff from the Howard Carter finding was on the Titanic
00:28:09,00:28:11,and it was the curse that brought it down.
00:28:11,00:28:12,Yeah.
00:28:12,00:28:13,Wow.
00:28:13,00:28:14,You guys must know that.
00:28:14,00:28:15,That was one of the classic childhood myths.
00:28:15,00:28:16,The classic childhood myths.
00:28:16,00:28:17,Yeah.
00:28:17,00:28:18,"Like, that was a children were told bedtime stories."
00:28:18,00:28:19,Dan was told conspiracy theories.
00:28:19,00:28:20,Okay.
00:28:20,00:28:21,And it's cradle.
00:28:21,00:28:22,Raised in terror.
00:28:22,00:28:23,I think it is Dan.
00:28:23,00:28:24,Little Dan.
00:28:24,00:28:26,The lizards are behind it all.
00:28:26,00:28:29,Sleep well.
00:28:29,00:28:33,"It is weird to think that, yeah, you might have molecules of water that were in the Titanic"
00:28:33,00:28:34,iceberg in you now.
00:28:34,00:28:37,Do you guys know about the world's largest iceberg?
00:28:37,00:28:38,No.
00:28:38,00:28:39,No.
00:28:39,00:28:45,"It's about the size of Jamaica, the half the size of Wales and it calved off in the year 2000"
00:28:45,00:28:49,and they think that there's probably still bits of it that haven't melted yet.
00:28:49,00:28:50,Wow.
00:28:50,00:28:51,Was that an antogtic one?
00:28:51,00:28:52,Yeah.
00:28:52,00:28:53,It was called iceberg B15.
00:28:53,00:28:54,Catchy.
00:28:54,00:28:59,"They don't have very creative names, icebergs, like hurricanes, they just, they have B50,"
00:28:59,00:29:00,"D12, D14."
00:29:00,00:29:01,D12?
00:29:01,00:29:02,Do they rap a lot?
00:29:02,00:29:03,They do.
00:29:03,00:29:04,Yeah.
00:29:04,00:29:06,I was looking at oil rigs.
00:29:06,00:29:11,America's third largest oil field is LA and it's completely concealed.
00:29:11,00:29:16,"So if most oil fields you picture like those big pylons, LA is full of secret oil rigs."
00:29:16,00:29:21,"So LA started sort of hipifying around, I think, the 1930s and people who had built these"
00:29:21,00:29:22,huge oil rig buildings.
00:29:22,00:29:26,The skies there's normal buildings in LA and they're all over Hollywood and there are
00:29:26,00:29:29,just buildings all over LA which look like normal concrete buildings and inside they're
00:29:29,00:29:32,"sucking up, you know, hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil."
00:29:32,00:29:34,"For most of the transformers of the oil industry, aren't they?"
00:29:34,00:29:35,Towing an iceberg.
00:29:35,00:29:36,Yeah.
00:29:36,00:29:42,We've done some computer models to see if it's feasible to tow an iceberg from the Arctic
00:29:42,00:29:48,down to Africa to give people drinking water and they think that you could take an iceberg
00:29:48,00:29:53,"from Newfoundland to the northwest coast of Africa, it would take five months and would retain"
00:29:53,00:29:56,more than 60% of the iceberg's mass.
00:29:56,00:29:58,"If it was the cheapest way, it might have been tried."
00:29:58,00:29:59,They must be.
00:29:59,00:30:00,They did try it.
00:30:00,00:30:01,"Well, did that was tried."
00:30:01,00:30:02,Wow.
00:30:02,00:30:03,Yeah.
00:30:03,00:30:07,"In the second half of the 19th century, smaller icebergs were routinely taken up to Peru"
00:30:07,00:30:09,for refrigeration in the brewing business.
00:30:09,00:30:10,Oh.
00:30:10,00:30:11,Over on the South Pole.
00:30:11,00:30:12,Yes.
00:30:12,00:30:13,Right.
00:30:13,00:30:14,I see.
00:30:14,00:30:15,So why do they keep them?
00:30:15,00:30:19,In the harbor where they just have loads of icebergs.
00:30:19,00:30:21,Must look so bizarre.
00:30:21,00:30:26,"It's not only icebergs that we're lassoing, NASA is investing in a project to lasso and asteroid"
00:30:26,00:30:31,"using a robotic space lasso, to lassoing an asteroid into lunar orbit to make sure it orbits"
00:30:31,00:30:36,"the moon so that it hopes that by 2025, we're going to be able to use it, astronauts will"
00:30:36,00:30:40,be able to use it as a way station from which to extract consumables on the way to Mars.
00:30:40,00:30:43,That's like the worst idea I've ever had.
00:30:43,00:30:48,We've already established that losing the moon would solve all our problems.
00:30:48,00:30:50,"And now we're saying, let's bring another moon."
00:30:50,00:30:51,Yeah.
00:30:51,00:30:52,A moon for the moon.
00:30:52,00:30:56,"Okay, that's it for this week's podcast."
