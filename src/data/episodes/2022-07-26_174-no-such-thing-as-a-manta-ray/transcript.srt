1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,880
 Hey everyone, before we begin this episode of Fish, we just want to let you know that we're starting a whole new thing.

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:13,320
 Yes, and that thing is Facebook Live, and it's going to be every Monday at 5 in the afternoon, British time.

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:19,160
 And we're going to be on Facebook. We're going to be streaming a video of ourselves at Facebook.com/nosuchthingasoffish,

4
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,160
 where we talk about the past week's episode.

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,640
 That's the idea. We always, when we put these episodes out, get lots of emails, lots of tweets,

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,880
 lots of people in the streets running up to us and shouting that we got things right, we got things wrong, they want to add things,

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:37,160
 and we thought, "Why don't we turn it into a sort of post-episode book club where we talk about the previous week's episode?"

8
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,040
 So come there armed with your facts, with your questions.

9
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:45,240
 With your complaints, you know, if you think someone says something stupid, it's a dance at another fact that wasn't true.

10
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:50,480
 If you think we missed a joke, we quite often get tweets or emails saying, "I can't believe you didn't make this joke."

11
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,040
 Yeah, maybe don't bring the abuse bird about my facts, but everything else, absolutely.

12
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:02,480
 Yeah, so we'll be there 5pm British time, it's facebook.com/nosuchthingasoffish, and we hope to see you there.

13
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,560
 So, yeah.

14
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,400
 And with the show.

15
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:27,560
 Hello and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing As A Fish" a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

16
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:33,960
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, and Anna Chazinski.

17
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,600
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our 4 favorite facts from the last 7 days.

18
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,040
 And in no particular order, here we go. Starting with you, James Harkin.

19
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:51,840
 Okay, my fact this week is that Guinness World Records have entries for most mouse traps released on the tongue,

20
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,840
 most matchsticks extinguished by the tongue, and most fan blades stopped by the tongue.

21
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,640
 Wow.

22
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,040
 Is it all the same guy?

23
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,440
 No, different guys.

24
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,440
 Most mouse traps released on the tongue.

25
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:08,840
 And does it mean the mouse trap is on the tongue, or does the tongue make its way into the mouse trap?

26
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,040
 That wouldn't be very impressive, would it?

27
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,040
 If you just balanced a mouse trap on your tongue and then it snapped against air in your mouth?

28
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,040
 Yeah, no.

29
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,040
 It's really not that.

30
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,040
 It's literally getting a mouse trap sticking your tongue in it and it's just going to snap.

31
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,040
 Wow.

32
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,040
 What is the record? What's the most?

33
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:31,040
 The record is 53, and it was done by a guy called whose surname is Casey, I can't remember his first name.

34
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:39,040
 And weirdly, he did it at the Murray Land Renaissance Festival where they reenact things that happened during the Renaissance.

35
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,040
 Yeah.

36
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,040
 Got famous.

37
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,040
 Yeah, I think that was under Louis XIV, wasn't it?

38
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,040
 There's a tongue record that's missing from your list there.

39
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,040
 There's a few, yeah.

40
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,040
 Yeah, this is my favourite one.

41
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:55,040
 The most blow torches extinguished with a tongue in one minute.

42
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,040
 So I want to compare matches to blow torches then.

43
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,040
 Yeah.

44
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,040
 How many blow torches?

45
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,040
 48 in one minute.

46
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,040
 In one minute.

47
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:10,040
 In one minute, is this Australian guy from Byron Bay called Shane, but spelled C-H, Shane Holtgren.

48
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:16,040
 He had a blow torch in each hand and he was putting them out with his tongue and he did 48 in one minute.

49
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:24,040
 Did you know that Shane Holtgren is married to Zoe Ellis, who holds a record for most mouse traps released on the tongue in one minute.

50
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,040
 Open brackets, female closed brackets.

51
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,040
 Wow.

52
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,040
 Yeah, so they have the talented tongues.

53
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,040
 And how you meet at that convention or whatever.

54
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,040
 And he said, "Put it through."

55
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,040
 Just why?

56
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,040
 Why did they marry?

57
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,040
 Why did they do this stuff?

58
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,040
 Because they want to get in the Guinness Book of Records.

59
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:50,040
 So for instance, the guy who did the most matchsticks extinguished is a guy called Asherita Ferman.

60
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,040
 And he holds records for the most Guinness World Records.

61
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,040
 And basically, he just tries to beat as many world records as he can.

62
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,040
 Wow.

63
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:03,040
 So he also has records like Pogo Stick Jumping Underwater Longest Juration.

64
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,040
 Underwater, okay.

65
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,040
 Not easier underwater, really.

66
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:11,040
 So I think that trivialises the good name of the Stopping of Fanblade with your tongue.

67
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,040
 Guinness World Records.

68
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,040
 Yeah.

69
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,040
 Hopscotch most games in one hour. How many do you think that is?

70
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,040
 Four.

71
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,040
 Twenty.

72
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,040
 Well, I don't know how long a game of Hopscotch takes, really.

73
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,040
 I can't remember how it starts, it finishes.

74
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,040
 The 3600 seconds in an hour. How long does it take to play a game of Hopscotch?

75
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,040
 Well, surely you can have unlimited people playing Hopscotch in which case they could take forever.

76
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,040
 But if there's just one of you, then you could do a game every minute.

77
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:37,040
 Well, I think if you're trying to beat the record, you probably don't want infinite number of people playing.

78
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,040
 Okay.

79
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,040
 You probably did it on his own.

80
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,040
 Hang on, I'm going to say it takes 20 seconds to play a game of Hopscotch.

81
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,040
 Oh, sorry.

82
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,040
 I know the rules of Hopscotch.

83
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,040
 I think we've ascertained, I don't.

84
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:51,040
 So I think what you do, if my memory serves, is you throw a little stone onto the number one,

85
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,040
 and then you Hopscotch it around, and then you come pick it up, and then you throw it onto the two,

86
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,040
 and then you Hopscotch round, and then you do three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

87
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,040
 Is that right, Anna?

88
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,040
 That is correct.

89
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,040
 Why do you have to throw a stone to get onto the...

90
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,040
 Well, that's a game.

91
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,040
 It's just a game, because if you don't get it...

92
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,040
 It's like, why do I have to hit this tennis ball over the net?

93
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,040
 What's even the point? It just keeps coming back.

94
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,040
 But if you miss, do you have to throw it again?

95
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,040
 If you miss.

96
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,040
 If you miss the one, if I'm throwing my second or the other one.

97
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,040
 Yeah, you do.

98
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,040
 If you're playing against another person, say you and I were playing and you missed the two,

99
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,040
 then it will be my turn to aim for the one.

100
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,040
 And it will be whoever completes it first.

101
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:26,040
 I think I can see why tennis took off in a bigger way, to be honest.

102
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,040
 I think if you're missing the one, you're not made for that game anyway.

103
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,040
 All right, it's true.

104
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,040
 It's one of those, it gets progressively harder, because the tennis further away from the one.

105
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,040
 All right, the one who says it takes five minutes to play against Hopscotch.

106
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,040
 So I think he did 12 in an hour.

107
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,040
 He did 33.

108
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,040
 33. I said, 40? Do I say it?

109
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,040
 You said 20.

110
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,040
 Great.

111
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,040
 It's pretty good. That's pretty good.

112
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:51,040
 But this guy firm and is quite good, because he invents new things to beat records in.

113
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:58,040
 And so he invented a thing called land rowing, where you basically get a indoor rowing machine.

114
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,040
 You put wheels on it and then you try and go as far as possible or as quick as possible.

115
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,040
 And he got the record in that, because he invented it.

116
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:11,040
 But De Guinness accepts his invented new criteria, this biggest weirdo in the playground,

117
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,040
 to keep some making up new records to break.

118
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,040
 Don't they decide?

119
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,040
 Yeah, you would think that.

120
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,040
 I reckon he must have friends on the inside, right?

121
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,040
 Yeah.

122
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:24,040
 I think he's broken so many records, they kind of like him and they accept some of his more unusual.

123
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:29,040
 Because they must see his number come up on the Guinness phone system in the office and go,

124
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,040
 oh no.

125
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,040
 What's he thought of this time?

126
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,040
 And he's like, most phone calls to Guinness.

127
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,040
 Are there rules about what you can do in terms of?

128
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:42,040
 Because they haven't got like the record for the fastest anyone's chop their own hand off.

129
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,040
 So where does it stop?

130
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:48,040
 Because you can put out a blowtorch on your tongue, which I presume is quite painful.

131
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:53,040
 So they tend to accept quite a lot of things until someone says, no, this is dangerous.

132
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,040
 So for instance, they stopped obese animals quite recently.

133
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,040
 Oh, yeah.

134
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,040
 Because there was always people saying, my cat is, you know, the fattest cat ever.

135
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:06,040
 And then they said, well, actually, it's not very good to feed your cat Mars bars all the time.

136
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,040
 So maybe we shouldn't have this record anymore.

137
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,040
 With the record for stopping fan blades.

138
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,040
 Yeah.

139
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,040
 Are we talking ceiling fan?

140
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:19,040
 Well, one of those fans where you'd have to put your tongue in between the bits of caging in order to get...

141
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,040
 Surely it's a little handheld fan.

142
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,040
 I have a feeling it isn't.

143
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:28,040
 I've seen a photo of it, but my memory, my visual memory isn't good enough to remember what it looked like.

144
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,040
 But I've a feeling it was quite a big fan.

145
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,040
 Right.

146
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,040
 Like a big sort of one that you would get in a warehouse.

147
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,040
 Who cares?

148
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,040
 Imagine you're at a rave and it's getting really hot in there.

149
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,040
 And so they get some kind of industrial fans to put in the corner.

150
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,040
 Yeah, it was implausible from when you said, imagine you're at a rave.

151
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:50,040
 Unless I'm there in an administrative capacity.

152
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,040
 The only rave I ever went to.

153
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,040
 I got kicked out of the sleep. I got to fall asleep.

154
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,040
 And I was the one who got trouble.

155
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:02,040
 I woke up. Everyone was doing drugs around me and they're like, hey, you can't do that in here.

156
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,040
 Have you heard about the record for the longest tongue?

157
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,040
 This is another Guinness record.

158
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:12,040
 Okay, so the average tongue, the average person's tongue is 10 centimeters from the back of the throat.

159
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,040
 The point is called the oropharynx is where it joins the back of your mouth.

160
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,040
 The man with the longest tongue, as of 2015, was a guy called Nick Sturbo.

161
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:26,040
 And he has a tongue which when his mouth is closed extends 10 centimeters out of his mouth.

162
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:31,040
 So it's like he's got an entire whole normal tongue outside his mouth.

163
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,040
 But not when his mouth is closed because when his mouth is closed it will be inside his mouth.

164
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,040
 And his mouth is closed around his tongue.

165
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,040
 Can he put it back in his mouth?

166
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,040
 He can put it back in his mouth.

167
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,040
 Does he roll it up like a party, though?

168
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,040
 He doesn't roll it up like a thing.

169
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,040
 He's missing a trick, man.

170
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,040
 Well, how does he fit it in?

171
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,040
 Well, he says it's perfectly comfortable, doesn't he?

172
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,040
 I would have thought that would be really uncomfortable.

173
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,040
 He doesn't know any different, does he?

174
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,040
 That's a really good point.

175
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,040
 Do you know what he uses his tongue for?

176
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,040
 He's a respectable man.

177
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,040
 He advertises on it.

178
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,040
 Like little banners.

179
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,040
 Does he pretend to have a party, but a party popper, you know, those things he blows, but he doesn't.

180
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,040
 It's just his tongue.

181
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,040
 That's not what he does, no.

182
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,040
 Does he use it to point directions to strangers when he has both his hands off?

183
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,040
 Yeah.

184
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,040
 He doesn't.

185
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,040
 You're one letter off with pointing, though.

186
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,040
 He paints with it.

187
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,040
 So he said that he made the good argument that a gift is something that you're born with.

188
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,040
 You get given.

189
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,040
 But to turn it into a talent, you have to use it in the best way you can.

190
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,040
 This is philosophy, so he's taken to painting with his tongue.

191
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,040
 And he calls it licking.

192
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,040
 So if he did in fact say, "How did you know what was that?"

193
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,040
 That's really good.

194
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,040
 Did you say it again?

195
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,040
 Licking.

196
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,040
 Yeah, so he'll say, "I licked his favourite animal as a beaver."

197
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,040
 He claimed to...

198
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,040
 I know.

199
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,040
 Because he's got a sense of humour this guy.

200
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:54,040
 So he'll say, "You know, I just licked a beaver and that'll be he just painted a beaver."

201
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,040
 But we have a word for painting things.

202
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,040
 Yeah.

203
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,040
 Not with the tongue, though.

204
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,040
 This guy can call it whatever he likes.

205
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,040
 What's the one doing here?

206
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,040
 Yeah, but licking is taken.

207
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,040
 It's done.

208
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,040
 That's not how it works with words.

209
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,040
 It does have to.

210
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:10,040
 It does have to wrap his tongue in cling film before he dips it in the paint.

211
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,040
 Does that make sense?

212
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,040
 Because the paint is acrylic or it...

213
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,040
 Who knows? It might be a lead based paint that he uses either way.

214
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:20,040
 He then has to lick the canvas with a cling film covered, paint covered tongue.

215
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,040
 Because he was inspired by someone he saw on YouTube.

216
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,040
 An Indian man who painted with his tongue,

217
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,040
 but who also got quite bad toxic humour for something.

218
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,040
 So he decided to avoid that.

219
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,040
 But do you know who he says his favourite artist is when he was asked to his favourite artist was?

220
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,040
 His second favourite is Picasso.

221
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,040
 Lickassel.

222
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,040
 Yeah.

223
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,040
 Can you give us a clue?

224
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,040
 Someone liked Picasso.

225
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,040
 Is it one of those elephants?

226
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,040
 Oh, that's unbelievably close.

227
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,040
 My clue is that Dan's really close.

228
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,040
 The monkey, bubbles.

229
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,040
 Coco, the gorilla.

230
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,040
 Oh, yeah.

231
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,040
 Yeah, very good.

232
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,040
 On tongues.

233
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,040
 There's a job, which is a baby food taster.

234
00:10:54,040 --> 00:11:01,040
 And I was reading, I think it was in the Guardian, a woman called Beth Anderson wrote a piece about what it's like being a baby food taster.

235
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:07,040
 So she's a super taster, which we've talked about before, which is people who have many times more taste buds on their tongues than normal people.

236
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,040
 And she's just, her company is just insured her tongue for a million pounds.

237
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,040
 Wow.

238
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,040
 So valuable is her tasting abilities?

239
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:18,040
 So she accidentally is looking at near the scurting board and there's a mouse trap down there.

240
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,040
 And she dies into a tongue first.

241
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:26,040
 But she says she really tries to get into the mindset of a baby when she tastes it.

242
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,040
 Wow.

243
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,040
 Wearing a nappy.

244
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,040
 Throwing up on her mouth, yeah.

245
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,040
 Sucking on people's nipples.

246
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:38,040
 She just says she makes a real effort to get into the mindset of a baby.

247
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,040
 So each time she puts a spoonful of pure aid, Sheppard's pie in her mouth.

248
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,040
 She tries to remember being six months old again.

249
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:50,040
 Just about like skillful tongues, there's a guy called Glynnecki.

250
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,040
 I can't remember his first name either.

251
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:57,040
 But he is one of the record holders in tying a cherry stem with his tongue.

252
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,040
 Do you know this kind of trick that people do?

253
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,040
 Yeah, yeah.

254
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:07,040
 So the first time he ever tried it was in the bar in Florida and it took him 20 minutes to do just one of them.

255
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:12,040
 And now his record is 679 stems in an hour.

256
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,040
 Wow.

257
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,040
 679 stems in an hour.

258
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,040
 Yeah, that's not right.

259
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,040
 No way.

260
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,040
 Well, way, way.

261
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,040
 That's so nice.

262
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,040
 One of the six seconds.

263
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,040
 That's good, isn't it?

264
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:24,040
 But then apparently he says if you try it, you'll get faster with practice.

265
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:30,040
 But if you master the skill, be prepared for relentless sexual subtext that comes with it.

266
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,040
 Oh, poor guy.

267
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,040
 I bet he's really hating that.

268
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,040
 Yeah.

269
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,040
 Did he invent that practice?

270
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,040
 No, he didn't.

271
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,040
 Oh no.

272
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,040
 As in this, a reasonably common thing.

273
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,040
 I remember hearing about it when I was a kid.

274
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,040
 Me too, yeah.

275
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,040
 Apparently you put it in your mouth, you fold it over by folding your tongue over.

276
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,040
 You know, like folding it backwards.

277
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:50,040
 And then you somehow manipulate the ends so that it goes into a loop.

278
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,040
 Yeah.

279
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,040
 This is what so my brother does it.

280
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,040
 And then he's like, it's really easy.

281
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,040
 You just fold it backwards with your tongue.

282
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,040
 And you're like, yeah, I've got that bit.

283
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,040
 And then you go, and then you just weave one bit through the other.

284
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,040
 This is one way you're using to do that.

285
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,040
 Yeah.

286
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,040
 My epic glossis.

287
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:06,040
 Knock it in with that.

288
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,040
 If you are a sommelier.

289
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:12,040
 Do you know what you should be doing with your tongue to keep it match fit?

290
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,040
 Okay.

291
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,040
 So we're talking wine tasting here, are we?

292
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,040
 We are.

293
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:20,040
 You should dip it in olive oil once a day.

294
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,040
 That's nice.

295
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,040
 Should you hang it out of your mouth as often as possible?

296
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,040
 So it gets aired.

297
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,040
 Yeah, maybe.

298
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,040
 Is it that you rub it with something or you treat it with something?

299
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,040
 Sort of, yeah.

300
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,040
 What they do.

301
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,040
 You don't know, Dan.

302
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,040
 I know the one that I've got on the paper, but you might have all suggested correct answers as well.

303
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,040
 I phrase that really badly.

304
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,040
 I'm not informed on what you shouldn't do.

305
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,040
 The answer is, is that you should lick rocks.

306
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,040
 Oh, come on.

307
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,040
 Yeah.

308
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,040
 It's to train their palate.

309
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,040
 So I guess it clears them.

310
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,040
 It rots it up.

311
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,040
 Maybe it releases sort of things.

312
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,040
 But that's what they recommend.

313
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,040
 It's this new book that's come out called Corkdork.

314
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
 And that's what you call obsessive sommeliers.

315
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,040
 Corkdorks.

316
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,040
 Corkdorks.

317
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,040
 Right.

318
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,040
 Yeah, so the Corkdorks, they lick rocks.

319
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,040
 They do tasting sessions at 10am, which they call tongue cardio.

320
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,040
 What?

321
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,040
 Tenam.

322
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,040
 Tongue the magic out for the tongue.

323
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,040
 Tongue cardio.

324
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,040
 Yeah.

325
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,040
 Can I just say one thing about tongue prints?

326
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,040
 I read an article.

327
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:24,040
 This was in a scientific journal about how tongue prints might be a good thing to use instead of fingerprints.

328
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,040
 Oh, wow.

329
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:30,040
 And they said that it's good because you can stick it out of your mouth for inspection.

330
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,040
 Otherwise, it's well protected in your mouth.

331
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,040
 So, you know, you keep it protected, but then you can stick it out.

332
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,040
 It's difficult to forge, according to them.

333
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:47,040
 According to them, the act of physically reaching or thrusting it out is a convincing proof for liveness in a person as well.

334
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,040
 That makes sense.

335
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,040
 I've always said that.

336
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:55,040
 Whereas, if you're sort of in a passport queue and you're holding your person, you've just murdered by the art.

337
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,040
 You can shove their finger onto the print thing and the one will be any of the wiser.

338
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,040
 Exactly.

339
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:07,040
 And does it not suffer, though, from, remember, there's that fact about how people in pineapple factories were losing their fingerprints?

340
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,040
 Yeah.

341
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,040
 Because of the acidic quality of the pineapple?

342
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,040
 There's an enzyme in it, yeah.

343
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,040
 Yeah.

344
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,040
 And so, and isn't there another fact that pineapples kind of eat our tongues as we're eating it?

345
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,040
 So, wouldn't you be altering your fingerprints every time you had a pineapple?

346
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:24,040
 Yeah, but then it's the same problem with the fingerprints, so it's no more problems than you already had.

347
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,040
 Kind of, except all of us don't work in a pineapple factory.

348
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:32,040
 But all of us don't eat pineapples constantly, that presumably you're touching pineapples with your fingers as much as you're eating them,

349
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,040
 unless people are feeding you pineapples.

350
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,040
 Got it.

351
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:41,040
 But I just, I would hate to, like, lose a case because the guy who rolled my house has a big lump of pineapples.

352
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,040
 And what would he have left his tongue print?

353
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,040
 Unless, unless you had a collection of rocks that he loved.

354
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,040
 And he was a civilian, maybe.

355
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,040
 It's some painting at my house.

356
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,040
 What are you going to do with a tongue print?

357
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,040
 Look, if you're a sommelier.

358
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,040
 You decide to rob a geologist else?

359
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:11,040
 Okay, it is time for fact number two.

360
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,040
 And that is my fact.

361
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:16,040
 My fact this week is that Pope John Paul, the second's Pope mobile,

362
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:21,040
 can be hired out for stag do's and hen do's.

363
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,040
 So this is the one that was built when he visited Ireland in 1979.

364
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,040
 And it was built by these two guys who were given a brief to build it.

365
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,040
 They weren't given too much money to build it.

366
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,040
 So some of the things that...

367
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,040
 Well, it was a problem because some of the things that are attached to the modern Pope mobile,

368
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:42,040
 that Pope Francis uses, i.e. bulletproof glass, was not affordable for the one,

369
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,040
 because no one was willing to pay for it.

370
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,040
 It cost like £200,000.

371
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,040
 They asked the government for the money, didn't they?

372
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,040
 But it never made it into their account.

373
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,040
 Yep, exactly. So instead they used shadowproof glass.

374
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,040
 And one of the builders said, so you know, if a fellow threw a stone at the vehicle,

375
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,040
 the glass wouldn't break.

376
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,040
 That was the level of protection that the Irish Pope mobile was giving.

377
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:05,040
 But so yeah, so once he left, the Pope mobile remained in Ireland.

378
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,040
 And it went to a museum. There were two of them.

379
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:12,040
 And they decided that it would be fun to rent them out for stag do's and hen parties.

380
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,040
 And that's what's done.

381
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:18,040
 And it still includes the original chair that the Pope sat on inside the actual...

382
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,040
 Is it like the...

383
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,040
 Because I think of the Pope mobile as being basically a bubble.

384
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,040
 So yeah, you're thinking of like the golf buggy version of the Pope.

385
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,040
 There's many like the Batmobile.

386
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,040
 There are many, many different versions.

387
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,040
 Oh, there's only one version of the Batmobile.

388
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,040
 No, there's plenty. You've got the Adam West Batmobile.

389
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,040
 But they all work the same, don't they?

390
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,040
 They look nothing like each other.

391
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,040
 They're all black.

392
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,040
 No, they're not.

393
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,040
 They're basically the same.

394
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,040
 Guys, they're not. Look at photos.

395
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,040
 A covely we're having this chat. They are completely different.

396
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,040
 How do you know it's a Batmobile then?

397
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,040
 Because Batmans in it.

398
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,040
 There are two.

399
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,040
 Does any car become a Batmobile then?

400
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,040
 Yeah, for the purposes.

401
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,040
 So if I gave him a lift in my mini,

402
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,040
 do you have to become a Batmobile?

403
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,040
 Yeah, if he has to get a train to a crime,

404
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,040
 does that become a Batmobile?

405
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,040
 It's still mobile, so it would be a mobile.

406
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,040
 He has a Batcopter.

407
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,040
 The helicopter.

408
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,040
 Right. Yeah.

409
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,040
 So there's...

410
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,040
 You just put Batman in it and it belongs to it.

411
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,040
 So, same with the Pope, same deal with the Pope.

412
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,040
 You put Pope in any car.

413
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,040
 It's a Batmobile.

414
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,040
 Yeah.

415
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,040
 So what do these staggered-handies?

416
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,040
 Because surely it can only fit one person in it.

417
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,040
 No, it's a pretty boring stag.

418
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,040
 No, you cut the stag in it.

419
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,040
 And that everyone else stands either side of it.

420
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,040
 Kind of throws rocks at it.

421
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:30,040
 So what it had was a sort of a truck-like area

422
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,040
 where 15 people could sit inside including the Pope.

423
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,040
 And then it had a balcony of sorts

424
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,040
 where the Pope came out to on the front

425
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,040
 to wave to people with a hand railings

426
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,040
 to make sure it didn't fall.

427
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,040
 That's why it can be lent out to stag do's

428
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,040
 because up to 15 people or 16 people can be inside of it.

429
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,040
 But of course, it was 300 euros an hour to rent, wasn't it?

430
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,040
 Yes.

431
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,040
 And they kind of suss out what kind of stag do you're going to be?

432
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,040
 Because obviously they want a bit of respect

433
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,040
 in the Pope's chair.

434
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,040
 Yeah, they said we'll be selective about who we choose.

435
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,040
 Will they?

436
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,040
 I don't know how selective you can be with stag do's.

437
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,040
 And then there's marketing itself as a stag do.

438
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,040
 Oh, I don't know.

439
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,040
 I've been on some pretty respectful stag do's.

440
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,040
 You were only invited for the admin though.

441
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:16,040
 I did the accounts and the billing stuff in the corner.

442
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,040
 Oh, dear.

443
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:22,040
 But Pope John Paul said he didn't even like the name Pope Mobile.

444
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,040
 He asked the media not to use the word Pope Mobile

445
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,040
 because he thought it was undignified.

446
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,040
 So imagine if he could have found out

447
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,040
 what would happen to it after that.

448
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,040
 And same with Pope Francis in the modern one,

449
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,040
 they all hate the word Pope Mobile

450
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,040
 I think it sounds as you say a bit sort of.

451
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,040
 Actually, Pope Francis doesn't like it at all, does he?

452
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,040
 He's very modest.

453
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,040
 And he thinks that you shouldn't be rolling around

454
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,040
 in this ground thing, especially for you.

455
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,040
 And he mostly just uses the vehicles that the Vatican has.

456
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,040
 It's got like a bunch of vehicles he can rent out.

457
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,040
 He drives himself around town on his own.

458
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,040
 He prefers to be out in the open.

459
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,040
 So he has an open top because there was an assassination attempt.

460
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,040
 And so since then they were often billet proof and stuff.

461
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,040
 But he's like, no, I want to feel close to my people.

462
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,040
 So he just stands in an open top car.

463
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,040
 He told reporters it's true anything could happen.

464
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,040
 But let's face it, am I age?

465
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,040
 I don't have much to lose.

466
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,040
 Yeah.

467
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,040
 So they're very relaxed actually.

468
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,040
 Yeah.

469
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,040
 And so the current one that he has,

470
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,040
 you always see it going at about 10 miles an hour.

471
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,040
 But if it needs to make a sudden escape,

472
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,040
 it can go up to 160 miles per hour.

473
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:24,040
 Yeah, it could just jet away at 160.

474
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,040
 I think that was the last place, wasn't it?

475
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,040
 The golf buggy type one.

476
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,040
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

477
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,040
 No way.

478
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,040
 That's something that an aerodynamic could get into.

479
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,040
 Yeah, I'm 160, yeah.

480
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,040
 It's a puzzle.

481
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,040
 I think wings come out the side and it just balances it.

482
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,040
 But he's not driving it.

483
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,040
 So he'll just sit in the box.

484
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,040
 No, no.

485
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,040
 No, it doesn't drive the Colombian.

486
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,040
 I thought he said, no, that's your mix of your Batman.

487
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,040
 You said he drives himself around.

488
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,040
 No.

489
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,040
 Do you mean in his little car?

490
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,040
 I said that.

491
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,040
 And that's the latest one drives himself around,

492
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,040
 just in the rental car.

493
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,040
 Just rents a car.

494
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,040
 It's the Vatican, special Vatican cars that they have.

495
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,040
 And they have their own license plates, don't they?

496
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,040
 Yeah.

497
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,040
 They all have a special Vatican city license plate.

498
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,040
 The license plates.

499
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:06,040
 Number Cv1, which stands for Stato de la Chita de El Vaticanto,

500
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,040
 which just means Vatican City basically.

501
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:11,040
 But the locals, the local joke in Rome is that it stands for

502
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,040
 say, Cristo Videsi.

503
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,040
 Hang on, James.

504
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,040
 Let me explain.

505
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,040
 You don't need to explain the joke.

506
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,040
 No, you're right.

507
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,040
 Let's move on.

508
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,040
 Can you explain it, please?

509
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,040
 It just means, say, Cristo Videsi.

510
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,040
 It just means if only Christ could see this.

511
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,040
 It's a joke about the Pope being flash.

512
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,040
 No, I get it.

513
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,040
 Oh, God.

514
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,040
 Let's move on.

515
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:35,040
 These two guys who built this original Pope were built

516
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,040
 that we were talking about.

517
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,040
 Yeah.

518
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,040
 They owned this company called O.B.A.M.

519
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,040
 and they were the biggest vehicle builders in the country

520
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,040
 at the time.

521
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:47,040
 They claimed to be the first people to make refrigerated trucks in Ireland.

522
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,040
 And this is the origin story of the company.

523
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,040
 They were in town one day having a pint.

524
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:55,040
 When they got a bus home, they noticed there were trucks going up and down the road

525
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:59,040
 and said, "Why, we should start doing a business making trucks."

526
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:02,040
 And then they became the biggest truck makers in Ireland.

527
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,040
 Wow.

528
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,040
 And made the Pope reveal.

529
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,040
 Awesome origin story.

530
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,040
 Right.

531
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:11,040
 And the other thing about this Pope reveal, the original one that we were talking about,

532
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,040
 is there is a place to keep a gun.

533
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:21,040
 And that was because US Archbishop Pail Masinkus was with the Pope at the time.

534
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,040
 And he always carried a gun with him wherever he went.

535
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,040
 I love the sound of this gun.

536
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:30,040
 And this guy, a deranged priest, attacked him once with a bayonet.

537
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,040
 Wow.

538
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,040
 And so he always kept a gun by his side.

539
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,040
 Attack the Pope.

540
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,040
 He was going for the Pope.

541
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,040
 What?

542
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,040
 A deranged priest.

543
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,040
 Beautiful words.

544
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,040
 Ran at the Pope with a bayonet.

545
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:44,040
 And this guy, Masinkus, managed to thwart him.

546
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,040
 With his gun.

547
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,040
 No, with his bare fists.

548
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,040
 Okay.

549
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:53,040
 And then from then on, when they built the Pope mobile, they built this little pouch

550
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,040
 that he could have his gun in there.

551
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:00,040
 The last time that there was an assassination attempt on the Pope,

552
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,040
 it was this guy called Mehmet Ali Adce.

553
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,040
 And it was in 1981.

554
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:08,040
 And he'd actually escaped from prison in Turkey for another murder.

555
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,040
 But he tried to kill the Pope and he went to prison.

556
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,040
 And he's been let out now.

557
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,040
 And he's done a bunch of things.

558
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:16,040
 First of all, he said he wants to meet the current Pope.

559
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,040
 But he already had that.

560
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,040
 Bring him over.

561
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,040
 No, but he feels really bad.

562
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,040
 And the other Pope who retired as well.

563
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,040
 Can they get that open-roof car that the love's getting in?

564
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,040
 He's seen the error of his way.

565
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,040
 So he also wants to convert Catholicism.

566
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,040
 And one of the first things he did was he went and laid some roses

567
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:37,040
 at the John Paul II's tomb, who is the guy that he tried to assassinate.

568
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,040
 But he's also said, in 2010, he said, by the way, guys,

569
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,040
 I'm up for killing Osama bin London.

570
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,040
 If you guys want me to.

571
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:46,040
 You may just dress him as the Pope.

572
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:50,040
 I think you're all being really cynical about it.

573
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,040
 He's recently reformed, man.

574
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:56,040
 He's also approached Dan Brown, because he wants to write a book with him.

575
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,040
 What?

576
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:01,040
 Yeah, he wants to write a book of his life and adventures as a potential Pope assassin.

577
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,040
 But yeah, so I quite like that all these countries around the world

578
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,040
 have Pope mobiles waiting to go.

579
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:10,040
 So occasionally they bring a Pope mobile in a plane

580
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,040
 if the Pope is visiting a country.

581
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:18,040
 So like the beast, like how the American president has the big beast car

582
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,040
 that gets taken over season in the planes.

583
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,040
 They do that.

584
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,040
 But most countries like Ireland have one, well, Ireland used to have one already.

585
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,040
 I don't think they'll be using that one.

586
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,040
 Pope Francis is next to him.

587
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,040
 So just wipe it down.

588
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,040
 Okay, we need to have it returned Pope by seven,

589
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:35,040
 because there's a stagdew for Nikki going on.

590
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,040
 Okay, it's time for fact number three.

591
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,040
 And that is Andy.

592
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:49,040
 My fact is that there is no such thing as a manta ray.

593
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:53,040
 Okay, so just to clarify what a manta ray is before I blow your minds.

594
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,040
 It's a type of fish.

595
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,040
 It's a type of fish.

596
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,040
 Of which there is no such thing.

597
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,040
 Yes.

598
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,040
 And this is another thing, which is already part of a no such thing thing,

599
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,040
 which is also a no such thing.

600
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,040
 Exactly, yes.

601
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,040
 It's become kind of an anti-matter podcast, doesn't it?

602
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,040
 Dark matter podcast.

603
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,040
 So there is a new paper out about these things.

604
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,040
 Manta rays.

605
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,040
 And you'll know what I mean when I say Manta ray.

606
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:19,040
 The absolutely massive sales shaped fish that swim through the water.

607
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,040
 They're really huge.

608
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:24,040
 Sometimes you'll see it on the sidebar of the internet with one behind a lady in a bikini.

609
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,040
 Yes, it's a very popular meme.

610
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:29,040
 It's a photo that was taken where three people were having the photo in the ocean

611
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,040
 and suddenly behind them.

612
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,040
 Manta ray rises up and is photo bombing them.

613
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,040
 Oh, that's very nice.

614
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,040
 Okay, well, those things don't exist, basically.

615
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:41,040
 So there's a new study in the zoological Journal of the Linae in society.

616
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,040
 And there are two species of Manta ray.

617
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:46,040
 And there are nine species of Manta ray.

618
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:50,040
 And this paper is arguing that Manta rays have basically been miscategorised

619
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,040
 and that they actually all fit into Manta ray.

620
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,040
 They're saying, basically, that they're all the same thing.

621
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:57,040
 But because Manta rays were named first,

622
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,040
 that everything has to be called Manta ray.

623
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,040
 Because you're always named after the first thing that gets named.

624
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,040
 Yes.

625
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,040
 And these are not different enough, basically, to be their own genus.

626
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:10,040
 But the problem is, Manta ray is not very common word.

627
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:13,040
 Whereas Manta ray is a relatively common word.

628
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:16,040
 So people are just going to carry on calling the Manta rays,

629
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,040
 even though they're not really called that.

630
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:21,040
 I think even I may do, just by the fact that this is my fact this week.

631
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,040
 No, I think we should start the campaign.

632
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,040
 Mobulas are funnier word, I think.

633
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,040
 Mobula ray.

634
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,040
 Mobulas a bit on a matter of peak, as well.

635
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:31,040
 I bet they make a sound a little bit like "Mobula in the water."

636
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,040
 Do you think we do?

637
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,040
 Do you think they name themselves?

638
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,040
 Yeah, I see, isn't that what we'll fish to?

639
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,040
 We'll ask them what they're called.

640
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,040
 They tell you, then you kill them and put them in a museum.

641
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,040
 Yeah.

642
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:46,040
 Unless you name them Alfred, which is what the reef mantra is called.

643
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,040
 What?

644
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,040
 What?

645
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,040
 It's called Alfred. It's called Manta Alfredi.

646
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,040
 Oh, that's cool.

647
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,040
 This is named after Batman's Butler.

648
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,040
 That's right, yeah.

649
00:26:53,040 --> 00:27:00,040
 No, it's named after Queen Victoria's son Alfred.

650
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,040
 He was the first British Royal to visit Australia.

651
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:07,040
 So, they were so excited about getting a proper royal over that they named a mantra after.

652
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:12,040
 We actually got an email about this a couple of weeks ago from a guy called Rich Horner,

653
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:16,040
 who works out in Bali at the exact spot where they were doing all these tests.

654
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:19,040
 I mean, he works out in Bali, or he works out in Bali.

655
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:24,040
 He works out in Bali and between Jim Sessions wrote us an email.

656
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:28,040
 So, he wrote us an email saying he's been dying to tell us this range,

657
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:31,040
 because he listens to our podcast and has been known for a while.

658
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:34,040
 So, he said, "News just in, there's no such thing as a mantra ray.

659
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:38,040
 They've just been reclassified as big devil rays, brackets, modular rays.

660
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:44,040
 After DNA study of them, I work in Bali on Nusa Lembongan, which I believe is an area.

661
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,040
 That's pronounced differently."

662
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:51,040
 Where we work with Marine Megaforn, a foundation team, to ID the mantra rays here,

663
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,040
 creating a database of them all.

664
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,040
 We thought we had 30 to 40 of them 10 years ago.

665
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,040
 But by using their unique spot patterns on their chest and belly,

666
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:03,040
 we worked out that there were over 600 individuals here on our island.

667
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:06,040
 So, the project was set up there by Andrea Marshall.

668
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:11,040
 Andrea Marshall was a subject of a natural history documentary called Andrea Queen of the Mantis.

669
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,040
 And she was visiting the other day, giving us an update,

670
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:17,040
 presentation on her current research, and then drop the bombshell

671
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:22,040
 that her geneticist colleagues were writing a paper describing them as just big devil rays.

672
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,040
 I've been itching to tell you guys this for ages.

673
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,040
 There we go.

674
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,040
 Oh yeah.

675
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,040
 And he's offered that if we want to go swimming with these new modular rays,

676
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,040
 we're more than welcome to him, Bali.

677
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,040
 Yes.

678
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,040
 Yes please.

679
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,040
 Yes please.

680
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,040
 Do you think was there a huge gasp in the conference where she announced

681
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,040
 that actually mantar rays were just devil rays?

682
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,040
 I reckon some people stoned out.

683
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,040
 I think you're right.

684
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,040
 A few fainted maybe.

685
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,040
 That's what it is big news.

686
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,040
 It's huge news.

687
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,040
 Study.

688
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,040
 So you find out that they're actually just big deer.

689
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,040
 Yeah.

690
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,040
 That is huge.

691
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,040
 That's what it is like.

692
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:56,040
 But there must be like people who study mobulas and people who study mantas.

693
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,040
 Yeah.

694
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,040
 And now there's only one job for those two people.

695
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,040
 Yeah.

696
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,040
 Yeah.

697
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,040
 Yeah.

698
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,040
 Sacking's a hoi.

699
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,040
 Do you know they mate in a train?

700
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,040
 In a train?

701
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:09,040
 In a train of mantar rays.

702
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,040
 So like a conger line.

703
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,040
 A conger line.

704
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,040
 Yeah.

705
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:15,040
 God you've been in some pretty spicy parties.

706
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:20,040
 If they're mating in a train, doesn't that mean you're always mating with someone

707
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:23,040
 who's actually mating with someone else, who's actually mating with someone else?

708
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,040
 Oh, and is there always some poor mobular ray at the front?

709
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,040
 He's not getting any action.

710
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,040
 Unless they do it in a ring.

711
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,040
 Yes, unless it's a ring.

712
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,040
 Is it a ring?

713
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,040
 That wouldn't be a train.

714
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,040
 That'd be a weird train.

715
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,040
 It would be like a model rail.

716
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,040
 Yeah.

717
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,040
 I've got the answer here.

718
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,040
 We'll take it.

719
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:43,040
 So no, it's up to 30 males follow around one female.

720
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,040
 Right.

721
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,040
 And she leads them on a dance.

722
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:50,040
 And she tests their endurance to see if they're fit enough to breathe with her.

723
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,040
 And eventually she selects one.

724
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,040
 She does a load of cool swooshy moves through the water.

725
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,040
 So here's where she bit like the conger, isn't it?

726
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,040
 There's a bit like the conger.

727
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,040
 The person at the front says challenges.

728
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,040
 What they do are dance, don't they?

729
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,040
 Yeah.

730
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,040
 You follow in the leg.

731
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,040
 Yeah.

732
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:06,040
 And if you stay until the end, you get to have sex with someone.

733
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,040
 Is that it?

734
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,040
 That's how it works.

735
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,040
 I love the conger.

736
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:14,040
 And eventually the female at the front of the conger selects a single male and they mate.

737
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,040
 That's cool.

738
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:19,040
 They are very social and they hang out sort of in groups together, don't they?

739
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:26,040
 So they eat socially, like humans, a bit, sort of, in that they do what's called stacking.

740
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,040
 So there's one man to ray that will be at the front.

741
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,040
 And that's the one who's doing most of the feeding.

742
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,040
 And then he'll eat a lot of she will eat a lot of the plankton.

743
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,040
 And then the other plankton will be whipped around his body.

744
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:40,040
 And then we'll feed into the gaping mouths of the people behind him.

745
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,040
 And they switch roundtos at the front.

746
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,040
 So they just take it in turn to get us to be the prime feed.

747
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,040
 Very nice.

748
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,040
 It's really sweet.

749
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,040
 Yeah.

750
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,040
 Not if you're a plankton.

751
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,040
 No, that's true.

752
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,040
 No one ever thinks about a plankton.

753
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,040
 No one thought if you're a plankton, yeah.

754
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,040
 Do you think you've got past one of them?

755
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,040
 I feel like thank God for that.

756
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,040
 And then another one comes out already.

757
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,040
 I see.

758
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:03,040
 There is an article called "How do you stick a camera on a man to ray that I read?"

759
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,040
 Do you know how you do that?

760
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,040
 No.

761
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,040
 Can I see it quickly?

762
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:11,040
 Oh, I mean, I read that they're naturally incredibly mucousy.

763
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:14,040
 So wouldn't it just... they're coated in mucous.

764
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,040
 You lure them with that.

765
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,040
 That's what you do.

766
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:21,040
 No, is it that you just pop it on them in the mucous?

767
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,040
 No.

768
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,040
 Well, that's one of the problems.

769
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:29,040
 So if they usually put things on fish like with a suction cup,

770
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:34,040
 but the skin of the man to ray doesn't really allow for that falls off quite quickly.

771
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:38,040
 And so there was some scientists and they had some peanut butter with them.

772
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:42,040
 So they decided to smear peanut butter on the camera, on the suction pad.

773
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:45,040
 And it worked, miles better, and they stay on for like four or five hours now.

774
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,040
 Wow!

775
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,040
 That's amazing.

776
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,040
 Yeah.

777
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,040
 That's brilliant.

778
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:53,040
 Why do scientists have peanut butter, but not an adhesive, a scientific kind of glue?

779
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,040
 Crunchy or smooth?

780
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:57,040
 Well, that's the real question.

781
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,040
 Sorry, answer that.

782
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,040
 I'll start with that as a question.

783
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:07,040
 I think with proper adhesive, it might be difficult because it might be toxic, I suppose.

784
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,040
 Or you don't want it to stay on forever.

785
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,040
 It's quite good that it comes off after a few hours.

786
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,040
 Yeah.

787
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,040
 All right.

788
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,040
 I'll allow it.

789
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,040
 I've forgotten what Dan's question was.

790
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,040
 Crunchy or smooth.

791
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:19,040
 I actually deliberately forgot about that.

792
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,040
 Oh, sorry, sorry.

793
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,040
 It must be smooth, right?

794
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,040
 Yeah.

795
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:28,040
 There is one amazing website called elazmo-research.com.

796
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:32,040
 And it just has a Q&A section about man to rays.

797
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:36,040
 It reads like it was written by a man to ray, basically.

798
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:39,040
 It's just complete nonsense.

799
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:43,040
 No, it says, "Is it true man to rays have rescued fishermen?"

800
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:46,040
 And the answer is probably not.

801
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:50,040
 If, apart from breathing season, man to rays are not terribly interested in one another,

802
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:55,040
 they're probably not interested in a hapless fisherman either.

803
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,040
 I know.

804
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,040
 They can recognise themselves in a mirror, we think.

805
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,040
 We think.

806
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,040
 We're not sure.

807
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:04,040
 But if that is true, that is massive, because no fish has ever been shown to recognise itself in a mirror.

808
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:11,040
 So when you say we think, it's about how they act in front of the mirror as opposed to acting in front of another man to ray.

809
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:15,040
 So for instance, if I was to put a spot, I've got a marker in my hand.

810
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:18,040
 If I was to put a spot on your forehead and then showed you a mirror,

811
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:22,040
 you would likely, because you're an intelligent human, kind of try and wipe it off.

812
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,040
 Got it.

813
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:29,040
 And so if you did it to an animal, if you did it to, let's say, a shrew and put a dot on the head,

814
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:33,040
 they wouldn't recognise that it's their head with the dot on it, so they wouldn't try and wipe it off.

815
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,040
 If you did it to some primates, they would.

816
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,040
 If you did it to an elephant, they would.

817
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:39,040
 And I think what you're saying is, 'Manta ray wood' as well.

818
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:42,040
 Well, although the way they tested it with the 'Manta rays' this time.

819
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:46,040
 Excuse me, you've just got a little bit of...

820
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,040
 ...was nothing as advanced as that.

821
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:51,040
 They said that they put a mirror in front of the 'Manta rays'.

822
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:56,040
 And they noticed that the 'Manta rays', first of all, they didn't seem to try and attack or interact with the thing in the mirror,

823
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,040
 which implied that they knew it wasn't another 'Manta ray'.

824
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:04,040
 Right. And second of all, they blew bubbles and made odd body movements as if they were showing off their own bodies in front of the mirror.

825
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,040
 Wow. I believe it. I completely dig it.

826
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:09,040
 And I think they do save fishermen, actually.

827
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:13,040
 I think they're very sweet.

828
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:23,040
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Chazinski.

829
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:30,040
 My fact is that the former mayor of Bogota once hired 420 My Martists to make fun of traffic violators,

830
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:34,040
 because he believed Columbians fear ridicule more than they fear punishment.

831
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:37,040
 What was he called?

832
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,040
 He's called 'Antanus mocus'.

833
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,040
 I call him 'Antanus mocus'.

834
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,040
 I bet you do, yeah. It's not his name.

835
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,040
 Oh, my God, he's called 'mocus'. I know.

836
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,040
 I know. People to make fun of other people.

837
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,040
 It's perfect, isn't it?

838
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:53,040
 I think next he's going to get 'Antanus' is not his name.

839
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,040
 Anyway, this guy, 'Antanus mocus', is such an awesome guy.

840
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,040
 And so he was mayor at a number of times, and he changed Bogota in so many good ways.

841
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,040
 So this policy really worked.

842
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:08,040
 He fired all the traffic police, because they were known for being very corrupt and taking lots of bribes.

843
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,040
 And he, at first, he replaced them with just 20 My Martists.

844
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:15,040
 And they would do things like they'd, if a pedestrian crossed the road at the wrong time,

845
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:19,040
 or if someone was waiting in traffic and is about to skip a red light,

846
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:23,040
 the My Martists sort of chased them or go up to their window and like make mocking gestures at them.

847
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:28,040
 And they found that it really worked, and it reduced reckless driving and reckless pedestrianing.

848
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,040
 And so he added 400 more.

849
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:33,040
 But if you hired MIMES to replace your traffic cops,

850
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,040
 I think of traffic cops as basically MIMES.

851
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,040
 Yeah, they are.

852
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:39,040
 They're just sort of doing the gesturing, like, come on or no, you stop over here.

853
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,040
 Yeah, when they're doing stop, it's like they're in a tiny invisible box.

854
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,040
 Yeah, exactly.

855
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:49,040
 If you fail the MIME exams, do you bump down and become a traffic cop?

856
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,040
 Yeah, that's how it goes.

857
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:56,040
 The other thing about that is, if you like MIMES, I don't think that many people do like MIMES,

858
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:01,040
 but if you like them, maybe you would deliberately break the rules so that they came over and...

859
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,040
 You know when you're driving?

860
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,040
 Yeah.

861
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:08,040
 ...and there's like an electronic sign, and if you're going over 30 miles an hour, it does a little sad face.

862
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,040
 Yeah.

863
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,040
 You might deliberately go at 31 miles an hour, so that I get the sad face.

864
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,040
 It might be like that.

865
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,040
 Because you like sad faces.

866
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,040
 Yeah.

867
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,040
 But it does a happy face if you go under.

868
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,040
 Yeah, who wants a happy face?

869
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,040
 No, it's yeah.

870
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,040
 No wonder my text messages from you are so passive.

871
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:28,040
 See you later on a frown.

872
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:32,040
 Yeah, he is an amazing character, isn't he?

873
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,040
 Oh, thank you.

874
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:43,040
 He used to go round in the streets wearing a Superman outfit, claiming to be a character called Super Citizen.

875
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,040
 He's just one of those crazy cool guys.

876
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,040
 He didn't just do that for no reason.

877
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,040
 He did that while cleaning up the streets.

878
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,040
 Yeah, it's cleaning up the streets of crime.

879
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,040
 He would like, well, I think it was rubbish.

880
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:57,040
 That is a crime though, dropping rubbish.

881
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:01,040
 But that's not what Batman means, so he says he's cleaning the streets.

882
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:05,040
 That's Batman's day job, actually. That's how he made all those billions.

883
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,040
 Get the bad recycling like old bottles.

884
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:14,040
 No one's on as you can bring mugs back when you've drunk your mold wine, you get two pounds back.

885
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,040
 That's how he makes his money.

886
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,040
 To the bad bottle bin.

887
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:21,040
 Yeah, so he did that.

888
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:26,040
 He also did a really cool thing, which is he launched this idea, which was called A Night for Women.

889
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:31,040
 And the idea was that all the city's men stayed at home in the evening, caring for the children.

890
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:35,040
 And the city's 700,000 women would go out.

891
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,040
 I'm Tim.

892
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,040
 And Tim dressed as Superman.

893
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:43,040
 Wow, that is just an interesting character, isn't he?

894
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,040
 And the idea of being that women felt uncomfortable sometimes,

895
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:49,040
 because some people thought that some parts bogged out were dangerous at the time.

896
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,040
 And they feel much more comfortable if they go out and they don't see any men around.

897
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,040
 Which I can tell you guys.

898
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:58,040
 I'm so glad you're here to actually qualify the things I've said.

899
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:01,040
 I've just gone for the headlight.

900
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,040
 And it really worked.

901
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:10,040
 So he cut homicide rates by 70% and he cut traffic fatalities by 50%.

902
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,040
 And he was actually a mathematician.

903
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,040
 So the reason people, part of the reason people liked him was that he was a mass professor,

904
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:20,040
 who actually was sort of fired from sort of had to quit his job in 1993,

905
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:24,040
 because he was giving a lecture and the students in his lecture theatre weren't listening very hard.

906
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,040
 And so he dropped his trousers and mooned them all.

907
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,040
 And shortly afterwards resigned from the post of mass professor at the university.

908
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:33,040
 And instead became there.

909
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,040
 He said when they asked him about that,

910
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:39,040
 he said innovative behaviour can be useful when you run out of words.

911
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,040
 There you go.

912
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,040
 And that was his thing.

913
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,040
 He was saying no one's listening to me, no matter what I say.

914
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,040
 So I'm going to show them my ass.

915
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,040
 And maybe they'll listen.

916
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,040
 And that's like Anna says, that's how he became famous.

917
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,040
 And then once he became famous, then he started going into politics.

918
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:55,040
 But hiring the mind sounds like he's also run out of words there.

919
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,040
 You know, he's hiring people who want using words to solve another problem.

920
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,040
 He's a man of action.

921
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,040
 Yeah.

922
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,040
 He sounds amazing.

923
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,040
 Yeah.

924
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,040
 He is awesome.

925
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:08,040
 He brought the amount of money that was earned for the city way up, didn't he?

926
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,040
 Yeah, taxation.

927
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,040
 He said people could have a voluntary tax.

928
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,040
 That's right.

929
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,040
 Volunted to pay 10% more tax and thousands of people did.

930
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:20,040
 Yeah. So another thing he did is that he asked people to call his office if they came across a very honest taxi driver.

931
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,040
 Because he wanted to.

932
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:27,040
 150 people called and he organised to meet them all.

933
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,040
 And he came up with a group name for them, which was the Knights of the Zebra.

934
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:37,040
 And the idea was that they were just giving good impressions of good taxi drivers who exist on the beaten.

935
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,040
 If you were good, you might then become a Knight of the Zebra.

936
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:43,040
 Wow. Yeah. That's quite good.

937
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,040
 Which is a seriously cool title, which you definitely would try to be.

938
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:49,040
 If I was called a Knight of the Zebra, I would be better at my job than I am.

939
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,040
 I was reading a bit about Mimes for this fact.

940
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,040
 Oh, yeah.

941
00:39:53,040 --> 00:40:00,040
 Did you know that Marcel Maso, that pretty much the only mind anyone can ever name?

942
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:03,040
 He wants released an album.

943
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,040
 Call the best of Marcel Maso.

944
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,040
 No, he didn't.

945
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,040
 No, as well.

946
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,040
 So, well, I'm getting to that, Dan.

947
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,040
 Okay.

948
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,040
 There was once an album release called The Best of Marcel Maso,

949
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:15,040
 which was 19 minutes of silence in the moment of applause.

950
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,040
 And then the other side was exactly the same.

951
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,040
 That's very good.

952
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,040
 But it was produced as a joke by MGM.

953
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,040
 And his name was slightly misspelled on it, so we think it was name.

954
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,040
 But...

955
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,040
 But, but, but, but, but, but.

956
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,040
 This is true.

957
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:32,040
 Could not perform because the sound system failed.

958
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,040
 Really?

959
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:37,040
 Yeah, he was doing a sketch in a show in America in 1980.

960
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,040
 And it was a company by music, but then the music didn't work.

961
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,040
 So he said, this isn't going to work at all.

962
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,040
 So he just bowed and the curtains closed.

963
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,040
 I mean, yeah.

964
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:49,040
 I just have one more creative thing people are doing to stop traffic violations.

965
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,040
 I see.

966
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:54,040
 So, in Shenzhen, in China, they have a problem with traffic violations.

967
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:57,040
 And they've tried all these creative ways of stopping them.

968
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:01,040
 So, one of the things is that if you're called J-walking,

969
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,040
 then you're punished by being turned into a traffic warden.

970
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,040
 And you have to...

971
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,040
 You have to catch the next J-walker.

972
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,040
 And they make you wear this like...

973
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,040
 That's a brilliant idea.

974
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,040
 It's good, isn't it?

975
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,040
 Great game.

976
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:17,040
 And you have to wear a green hat, because apparently you're saying you're wearing a green hat in China as offensive.

977
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,040
 So you have to wear the slurrastic green.

978
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,040
 Exactly, because it means cuckolded.

979
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,040
 So it's offensive.

980
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,040
 You weren't so kidding.

981
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,040
 Would this be immediately on the spot?

982
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,040
 It's on the spot, yeah.

983
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:29,040
 And you just have to take over the job of the current traffic warden.

984
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,040
 If you're in a rush to get to work, too bad.

985
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,040
 You've got to put on your fluorescent green hat.

986
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,040
 Do they get your job?

987
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,040
 But another thing they're doing, as well as that,

988
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:42,040
 is they are stopping people from leaving their lights on high beam.

989
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,040
 When the police see someone with their lights on high beam,

990
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:47,040
 they pull the car over and they make the person go out of the car

991
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,040
 and stand facing their own car with their eyes straight into the high beam light.

992
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,040
 What?

993
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,040
 And stare at the bright lights with their car for five minutes.

994
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,040
 And then they send you blind?

995
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,040
 No.

996
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,040
 It's just a bit annoying.

997
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,040
 No.

998
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,040
 I mean, it would, in the short term, you would have lights in front of your eyes

999
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,040
 when you close your eyes.

1000
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,040
 Yeah.

1001
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,040
 But you wouldn't go blind.

1002
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:09,040
 It would make you an extremely dangerous driver as soon as you set off again in your car.

1003
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,040
 That's true.

1004
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,040
 It's like, to put it you for drink driving,

1005
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,040
 you've got to down this bottom of your skin.

1006
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:21,040
 Okay, that's it.

1007
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,040
 That is all of our facts.

1008
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,040

00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:41,040
 We can also be reached on our group account, which is @kypodcast.

1019
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,040
 And you can go to our website.

1020
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:46,040
 No such thing as a fish.com that has all of our previous episodes.

1021
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:49,040
 It has a link to our upcoming tour in October and November.

1022
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,040
 It's also got a link to our book that's coming out in November,

1023
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,040
 the book of the year.

1024
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,040
 So please pre-order that now if you can.

1025
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:00,040
 And also, if you like this episode and you want to discuss this episode,

1026
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:03,040
 you want to bring in your own facts, you've got things to add.

1027
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:06,040
 Every Monday, from now on, we are going to be doing a Facebook live

1028
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:12,040
 in which we deconstruct all the things that I got wrong in each episode,

1029
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:15,040
 as well as adding facts we didn't manage to get in on time.

1030
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,040
 New information we found out, as well as answering any of the questions

1031
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,040
 you guys might want to ask us about that week's episode.

1032
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:24,040
 So tune in, we're going to be doing it at 5pm on a Monday.

1033
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:28,040
 We'll put a link up on our Facebook page and on our Twitter to confirm the time.

1034
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,040
 But why not join us? It's going to be awesome.

1035
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,040
 Okay, we'll see you there. Good bye.

1036
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:42,040
