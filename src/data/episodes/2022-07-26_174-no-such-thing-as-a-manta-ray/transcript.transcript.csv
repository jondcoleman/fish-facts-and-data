00:00:00,00:00:05,"Hey everyone, before we begin this episode of Fish, we just want to let you know that we're starting a whole new thing."
00:00:05,00:00:13,"Yes, and that thing is Facebook Live, and it's going to be every Monday at 5 in the afternoon, British time."
00:00:13,00:00:19,"And we're going to be on Facebook. We're going to be streaming a video of ourselves at Facebook.com/nosuchthingasoffish,"
00:00:19,00:00:21,where we talk about the past week's episode.
00:00:21,00:00:25,"That's the idea. We always, when we put these episodes out, get lots of emails, lots of tweets,"
00:00:25,00:00:30,"lots of people in the streets running up to us and shouting that we got things right, we got things wrong, they want to add things,"
00:00:30,00:00:37,"and we thought, ""Why don't we turn it into a sort of post-episode book club where we talk about the previous week's episode?"""
00:00:37,00:00:40,"So come there armed with your facts, with your questions."
00:00:40,00:00:45,"With your complaints, you know, if you think someone says something stupid, it's a dance at another fact that wasn't true."
00:00:45,00:00:50,"If you think we missed a joke, we quite often get tweets or emails saying, ""I can't believe you didn't make this joke."""
00:00:50,00:00:55,"Yeah, maybe don't bring the abuse bird about my facts, but everything else, absolutely."
00:00:55,00:01:02,"Yeah, so we'll be there 5pm British time, it's facebook.com/nosuchthingasoffish, and we hope to see you there."
00:01:02,00:01:03,"So, yeah."
00:01:03,00:01:04,And with the show.
00:01:19,00:01:27,"Hello and welcome to another episode of ""No Such Thing As A Fish"" a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden."
00:01:27,00:01:33,"My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray, and Anna Chazinski."
00:01:33,00:01:39,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our 4 favorite facts from the last 7 days."
00:01:39,00:01:45,"And in no particular order, here we go. Starting with you, James Harkin."
00:01:45,00:01:51,"Okay, my fact this week is that Guinness World Records have entries for most mouse traps released on the tongue,"
00:01:51,00:01:57,"most matchsticks extinguished by the tongue, and most fan blades stopped by the tongue."
00:01:57,00:01:58,Wow.
00:01:58,00:02:00,Is it all the same guy?
00:02:00,00:02:01,"No, different guys."
00:02:01,00:02:03,Most mouse traps released on the tongue.
00:02:03,00:02:08,"And does it mean the mouse trap is on the tongue, or does the tongue make its way into the mouse trap?"
00:02:08,00:02:11,"That wouldn't be very impressive, would it?"
00:02:11,00:02:15,If you just balanced a mouse trap on your tongue and then it snapped against air in your mouth?
00:02:15,00:02:16,"Yeah, no."
00:02:16,00:02:17,It's really not that.
00:02:17,00:02:21,It's literally getting a mouse trap sticking your tongue in it and it's just going to snap.
00:02:21,00:02:22,Wow.
00:02:22,00:02:24,What is the record? What's the most?
00:02:24,00:02:31,"The record is 53, and it was done by a guy called whose surname is Casey, I can't remember his first name."
00:02:31,00:02:39,"And weirdly, he did it at the Murray Land Renaissance Festival where they reenact things that happened during the Renaissance."
00:02:39,00:02:40,Yeah.
00:02:40,00:02:42,Got famous.
00:02:42,00:02:45,"Yeah, I think that was under Louis XIV, wasn't it?"
00:02:45,00:02:48,There's a tongue record that's missing from your list there.
00:02:48,00:02:49,"There's a few, yeah."
00:02:49,00:02:50,"Yeah, this is my favourite one."
00:02:50,00:02:55,The most blow torches extinguished with a tongue in one minute.
00:02:55,00:02:58,So I want to compare matches to blow torches then.
00:02:58,00:02:59,Yeah.
00:02:59,00:03:00,How many blow torches?
00:03:00,00:03:02,48 in one minute.
00:03:02,00:03:03,In one minute.
00:03:03,00:03:10,"In one minute, is this Australian guy from Byron Bay called Shane, but spelled C-H, Shane Holtgren."
00:03:10,00:03:16,He had a blow torch in each hand and he was putting them out with his tongue and he did 48 in one minute.
00:03:16,00:03:24,"Did you know that Shane Holtgren is married to Zoe Ellis, who holds a record for most mouse traps released on the tongue in one minute."
00:03:24,00:03:26,"Open brackets, female closed brackets."
00:03:26,00:03:27,Wow.
00:03:27,00:03:29,"Yeah, so they have the talented tongues."
00:03:29,00:03:33,And how you meet at that convention or whatever.
00:03:33,00:03:35,"And he said, ""Put it through."""
00:03:35,00:03:38,Just why?
00:03:38,00:03:39,Why did they marry?
00:03:39,00:03:41,Why did they do this stuff?
00:03:41,00:03:44,Because they want to get in the Guinness Book of Records.
00:03:44,00:03:50,"So for instance, the guy who did the most matchsticks extinguished is a guy called Asherita Ferman."
00:03:50,00:03:53,And he holds records for the most Guinness World Records.
00:03:53,00:03:56,"And basically, he just tries to beat as many world records as he can."
00:03:56,00:03:57,Wow.
00:03:57,00:04:03,So he also has records like Pogo Stick Jumping Underwater Longest Juration.
00:04:03,00:04:05,"Underwater, okay."
00:04:05,00:04:06,"Not easier underwater, really."
00:04:06,00:04:11,So I think that trivialises the good name of the Stopping of Fanblade with your tongue.
00:04:11,00:04:12,Guinness World Records.
00:04:12,00:04:13,Yeah.
00:04:13,00:04:16,Hopscotch most games in one hour. How many do you think that is?
00:04:16,00:04:17,Four.
00:04:17,00:04:18,Twenty.
00:04:18,00:04:21,"Well, I don't know how long a game of Hopscotch takes, really."
00:04:21,00:04:23,"I can't remember how it starts, it finishes."
00:04:23,00:04:26,The 3600 seconds in an hour. How long does it take to play a game of Hopscotch?
00:04:26,00:04:30,"Well, surely you can have unlimited people playing Hopscotch in which case they could take forever."
00:04:30,00:04:32,"But if there's just one of you, then you could do a game every minute."
00:04:32,00:04:37,"Well, I think if you're trying to beat the record, you probably don't want infinite number of people playing."
00:04:37,00:04:38,Okay.
00:04:38,00:04:39,You probably did it on his own.
00:04:39,00:04:42,"Hang on, I'm going to say it takes 20 seconds to play a game of Hopscotch."
00:04:42,00:04:43,"Oh, sorry."
00:04:43,00:04:45,I know the rules of Hopscotch.
00:04:45,00:04:46,"I think we've ascertained, I don't."
00:04:46,00:04:51,"So I think what you do, if my memory serves, is you throw a little stone onto the number one,"
00:04:51,00:04:54,"and then you Hopscotch it around, and then you come pick it up, and then you throw it onto the two,"
00:04:54,00:04:58,"and then you Hopscotch round, and then you do three, four, five, six, seven, eight."
00:04:58,00:04:59,"Is that right, Anna?"
00:04:59,00:05:00,That is correct.
00:05:00,00:05:02,Why do you have to throw a stone to get onto the...
00:05:02,00:05:03,"Well, that's a game."
00:05:03,00:05:04,"It's just a game, because if you don't get it..."
00:05:04,00:05:06,"It's like, why do I have to hit this tennis ball over the net?"
00:05:06,00:05:08,What's even the point? It just keeps coming back.
00:05:08,00:05:10,"But if you miss, do you have to throw it again?"
00:05:10,00:05:11,If you miss.
00:05:11,00:05:13,"If you miss the one, if I'm throwing my second or the other one."
00:05:13,00:05:14,"Yeah, you do."
00:05:14,00:05:18,"If you're playing against another person, say you and I were playing and you missed the two,"
00:05:18,00:05:20,then it will be my turn to aim for the one.
00:05:20,00:05:22,And it will be whoever completes it first.
00:05:22,00:05:26,"I think I can see why tennis took off in a bigger way, to be honest."
00:05:26,00:05:29,"I think if you're missing the one, you're not made for that game anyway."
00:05:29,00:05:31,"All right, it's true."
00:05:31,00:05:35,"It's one of those, it gets progressively harder, because the tennis further away from the one."
00:05:35,00:05:37,"All right, the one who says it takes five minutes to play against Hopscotch."
00:05:37,00:05:39,So I think he did 12 in an hour.
00:05:39,00:05:40,He did 33.
00:05:40,00:05:42,"33. I said, 40? Do I say it?"
00:05:42,00:05:43,You said 20.
00:05:43,00:05:44,Great.
00:05:44,00:05:46,It's pretty good. That's pretty good.
00:05:46,00:05:51,"But this guy firm and is quite good, because he invents new things to beat records in."
00:05:51,00:05:58,"And so he invented a thing called land rowing, where you basically get a indoor rowing machine."
00:05:58,00:06:02,You put wheels on it and then you try and go as far as possible or as quick as possible.
00:06:02,00:06:05,"And he got the record in that, because he invented it."
00:06:05,00:06:11,"But De Guinness accepts his invented new criteria, this biggest weirdo in the playground,"
00:06:11,00:06:14,to keep some making up new records to break.
00:06:14,00:06:15,Don't they decide?
00:06:15,00:06:16,"Yeah, you would think that."
00:06:16,00:06:18,"I reckon he must have friends on the inside, right?"
00:06:18,00:06:19,Yeah.
00:06:19,00:06:24,"I think he's broken so many records, they kind of like him and they accept some of his more unusual."
00:06:24,00:06:29,"Because they must see his number come up on the Guinness phone system in the office and go,"
00:06:29,00:06:30,oh no.
00:06:30,00:06:31,What's he thought of this time?
00:06:31,00:06:34,"And he's like, most phone calls to Guinness."
00:06:34,00:06:37,Are there rules about what you can do in terms of?
00:06:37,00:06:42,Because they haven't got like the record for the fastest anyone's chop their own hand off.
00:06:42,00:06:44,So where does it stop?
00:06:44,00:06:48,"Because you can put out a blowtorch on your tongue, which I presume is quite painful."
00:06:48,00:06:53,"So they tend to accept quite a lot of things until someone says, no, this is dangerous."
00:06:53,00:06:57,"So for instance, they stopped obese animals quite recently."
00:06:57,00:06:58,"Oh, yeah."
00:06:58,00:07:02,"Because there was always people saying, my cat is, you know, the fattest cat ever."
00:07:02,00:07:06,"And then they said, well, actually, it's not very good to feed your cat Mars bars all the time."
00:07:06,00:07:09,So maybe we shouldn't have this record anymore.
00:07:09,00:07:12,With the record for stopping fan blades.
00:07:12,00:07:13,Yeah.
00:07:13,00:07:15,Are we talking ceiling fan?
00:07:15,00:07:19,"Well, one of those fans where you'd have to put your tongue in between the bits of caging in order to get..."
00:07:19,00:07:21,Surely it's a little handheld fan.
00:07:21,00:07:23,I have a feeling it isn't.
00:07:23,00:07:28,"I've seen a photo of it, but my memory, my visual memory isn't good enough to remember what it looked like."
00:07:28,00:07:31,But I've a feeling it was quite a big fan.
00:07:31,00:07:32,Right.
00:07:32,00:07:35,Like a big sort of one that you would get in a warehouse.
00:07:35,00:07:36,Who cares?
00:07:36,00:07:39,Imagine you're at a rave and it's getting really hot in there.
00:07:39,00:07:42,And so they get some kind of industrial fans to put in the corner.
00:07:42,00:07:45,"Yeah, it was implausible from when you said, imagine you're at a rave."
00:07:45,00:07:50,Unless I'm there in an administrative capacity.
00:07:50,00:07:52,The only rave I ever went to.
00:07:52,00:07:55,I got kicked out of the sleep. I got to fall asleep.
00:07:55,00:07:57,And I was the one who got trouble.
00:07:57,00:08:02,"I woke up. Everyone was doing drugs around me and they're like, hey, you can't do that in here."
00:08:02,00:08:04,Have you heard about the record for the longest tongue?
00:08:04,00:08:06,This is another Guinness record.
00:08:06,00:08:12,"Okay, so the average tongue, the average person's tongue is 10 centimeters from the back of the throat."
00:08:12,00:08:16,The point is called the oropharynx is where it joins the back of your mouth.
00:08:16,00:08:20,"The man with the longest tongue, as of 2015, was a guy called Nick Sturbo."
00:08:20,00:08:26,And he has a tongue which when his mouth is closed extends 10 centimeters out of his mouth.
00:08:26,00:08:31,So it's like he's got an entire whole normal tongue outside his mouth.
00:08:31,00:08:35,But not when his mouth is closed because when his mouth is closed it will be inside his mouth.
00:08:35,00:08:37,And his mouth is closed around his tongue.
00:08:37,00:08:39,Can he put it back in his mouth?
00:08:39,00:08:41,He can put it back in his mouth.
00:08:41,00:08:43,"Does he roll it up like a party, though?"
00:08:43,00:08:45,He doesn't roll it up like a thing.
00:08:45,00:08:47,"He's missing a trick, man."
00:08:47,00:08:49,"Well, how does he fit it in?"
00:08:49,00:08:51,"Well, he says it's perfectly comfortable, doesn't he?"
00:08:51,00:08:53,I would have thought that would be really uncomfortable.
00:08:53,00:08:55,"He doesn't know any different, does he?"
00:08:55,00:08:57,That's a really good point.
00:08:57,00:08:59,Do you know what he uses his tongue for?
00:08:59,00:09:01,He's a respectable man.
00:09:01,00:09:03,He advertises on it.
00:09:03,00:09:05,Like little banners.
00:09:05,00:09:09,"Does he pretend to have a party, but a party popper, you know, those things he blows, but he doesn't."
00:09:09,00:09:11,It's just his tongue.
00:09:11,00:09:13,"That's not what he does, no."
00:09:13,00:09:17,Does he use it to point directions to strangers when he has both his hands off?
00:09:17,00:09:18,Yeah.
00:09:18,00:09:19,He doesn't.
00:09:19,00:09:21,"You're one letter off with pointing, though."
00:09:21,00:09:23,He paints with it.
00:09:23,00:09:26,So he said that he made the good argument that a gift is something that you're born with.
00:09:26,00:09:27,You get given.
00:09:27,00:09:31,"But to turn it into a talent, you have to use it in the best way you can."
00:09:31,00:09:34,"This is philosophy, so he's taken to painting with his tongue."
00:09:34,00:09:36,And he calls it licking.
00:09:36,00:09:38,"So if he did in fact say, ""How did you know what was that?"""
00:09:38,00:09:40,That's really good.
00:09:40,00:09:42,Did you say it again?
00:09:42,00:09:43,Licking.
00:09:43,00:09:45,"Yeah, so he'll say, ""I licked his favourite animal as a beaver."""
00:09:45,00:09:46,He claimed to...
00:09:46,00:09:47,I know.
00:09:47,00:09:50,Because he's got a sense of humour this guy.
00:09:50,00:09:54,"So he'll say, ""You know, I just licked a beaver and that'll be he just painted a beaver."""
00:09:54,00:09:56,But we have a word for painting things.
00:09:56,00:09:57,Yeah.
00:09:57,00:09:58,"Not with the tongue, though."
00:09:58,00:09:59,This guy can call it whatever he likes.
00:09:59,00:10:00,What's the one doing here?
00:10:00,00:10:02,"Yeah, but licking is taken."
00:10:02,00:10:03,It's done.
00:10:03,00:10:05,That's not how it works with words.
00:10:05,00:10:06,It does have to.
00:10:06,00:10:10,It does have to wrap his tongue in cling film before he dips it in the paint.
00:10:10,00:10:11,Does that make sense?
00:10:11,00:10:13,Because the paint is acrylic or it...
00:10:13,00:10:15,Who knows? It might be a lead based paint that he uses either way.
00:10:15,00:10:20,"He then has to lick the canvas with a cling film covered, paint covered tongue."
00:10:20,00:10:22,Because he was inspired by someone he saw on YouTube.
00:10:22,00:10:24,"An Indian man who painted with his tongue,"
00:10:24,00:10:27,but who also got quite bad toxic humour for something.
00:10:27,00:10:28,So he decided to avoid that.
00:10:28,00:10:32,But do you know who he says his favourite artist is when he was asked to his favourite artist was?
00:10:32,00:10:34,His second favourite is Picasso.
00:10:34,00:10:35,Lickassel.
00:10:35,00:10:36,Yeah.
00:10:36,00:10:38,Can you give us a clue?
00:10:38,00:10:39,Someone liked Picasso.
00:10:39,00:10:41,Is it one of those elephants?
00:10:41,00:10:42,"Oh, that's unbelievably close."
00:10:42,00:10:44,My clue is that Dan's really close.
00:10:44,00:10:46,"The monkey, bubbles."
00:10:46,00:10:47,"Coco, the gorilla."
00:10:47,00:10:48,"Oh, yeah."
00:10:48,00:10:49,"Yeah, very good."
00:10:49,00:10:50,On tongues.
00:10:50,00:10:54,"There's a job, which is a baby food taster."
00:10:54,00:11:01,"And I was reading, I think it was in the Guardian, a woman called Beth Anderson wrote a piece about what it's like being a baby food taster."
00:11:01,00:11:07,"So she's a super taster, which we've talked about before, which is people who have many times more taste buds on their tongues than normal people."
00:11:07,00:11:11,"And she's just, her company is just insured her tongue for a million pounds."
00:11:11,00:11:12,Wow.
00:11:12,00:11:13,So valuable is her tasting abilities?
00:11:13,00:11:18,So she accidentally is looking at near the scurting board and there's a mouse trap down there.
00:11:18,00:11:20,And she dies into a tongue first.
00:11:20,00:11:26,But she says she really tries to get into the mindset of a baby when she tastes it.
00:11:26,00:11:27,Wow.
00:11:27,00:11:28,Wearing a nappy.
00:11:28,00:11:30,"Throwing up on her mouth, yeah."
00:11:30,00:11:32,Sucking on people's nipples.
00:11:32,00:11:38,She just says she makes a real effort to get into the mindset of a baby.
00:11:38,00:11:42,"So each time she puts a spoonful of pure aid, Sheppard's pie in her mouth."
00:11:42,00:11:44,She tries to remember being six months old again.
00:11:44,00:11:50,"Just about like skillful tongues, there's a guy called Glynnecki."
00:11:50,00:11:52,I can't remember his first name either.
00:11:52,00:11:57,But he is one of the record holders in tying a cherry stem with his tongue.
00:11:57,00:11:59,Do you know this kind of trick that people do?
00:11:59,00:12:00,"Yeah, yeah."
00:12:00,00:12:07,So the first time he ever tried it was in the bar in Florida and it took him 20 minutes to do just one of them.
00:12:07,00:12:12,And now his record is 679 stems in an hour.
00:12:12,00:12:13,Wow.
00:12:13,00:12:14,679 stems in an hour.
00:12:14,00:12:15,"Yeah, that's not right."
00:12:15,00:12:16,No way.
00:12:16,00:12:17,"Well, way, way."
00:12:17,00:12:18,That's so nice.
00:12:18,00:12:19,One of the six seconds.
00:12:19,00:12:20,"That's good, isn't it?"
00:12:20,00:12:24,"But then apparently he says if you try it, you'll get faster with practice."
00:12:24,00:12:30,"But if you master the skill, be prepared for relentless sexual subtext that comes with it."
00:12:30,00:12:31,"Oh, poor guy."
00:12:31,00:12:32,I bet he's really hating that.
00:12:32,00:12:33,Yeah.
00:12:33,00:12:34,Did he invent that practice?
00:12:34,00:12:35,"No, he didn't."
00:12:35,00:12:36,Oh no.
00:12:36,00:12:37,"As in this, a reasonably common thing."
00:12:37,00:12:39,I remember hearing about it when I was a kid.
00:12:39,00:12:40,"Me too, yeah."
00:12:40,00:12:44,"Apparently you put it in your mouth, you fold it over by folding your tongue over."
00:12:44,00:12:46,"You know, like folding it backwards."
00:12:46,00:12:50,And then you somehow manipulate the ends so that it goes into a loop.
00:12:50,00:12:51,Yeah.
00:12:51,00:12:52,This is what so my brother does it.
00:12:52,00:12:53,"And then he's like, it's really easy."
00:12:53,00:12:54,You just fold it backwards with your tongue.
00:12:54,00:12:55,"And you're like, yeah, I've got that bit."
00:12:55,00:12:58,"And then you go, and then you just weave one bit through the other."
00:12:58,00:13:00,This is one way you're using to do that.
00:13:00,00:13:01,Yeah.
00:13:01,00:13:02,My epic glossis.
00:13:02,00:13:06,Knock it in with that.
00:13:06,00:13:08,If you are a sommelier.
00:13:08,00:13:12,Do you know what you should be doing with your tongue to keep it match fit?
00:13:12,00:13:13,Okay.
00:13:13,00:13:15,"So we're talking wine tasting here, are we?"
00:13:15,00:13:16,We are.
00:13:16,00:13:20,You should dip it in olive oil once a day.
00:13:20,00:13:21,That's nice.
00:13:21,00:13:24,Should you hang it out of your mouth as often as possible?
00:13:24,00:13:26,So it gets aired.
00:13:26,00:13:28,"Yeah, maybe."
00:13:28,00:13:31,Is it that you rub it with something or you treat it with something?
00:13:31,00:13:33,"Sort of, yeah."
00:13:33,00:13:34,What they do.
00:13:34,00:13:35,"You don't know, Dan."
00:13:35,00:13:39,"I know the one that I've got on the paper, but you might have all suggested correct answers as well."
00:13:39,00:13:41,I phrase that really badly.
00:13:41,00:13:44,I'm not informed on what you shouldn't do.
00:13:44,00:13:47,"The answer is, is that you should lick rocks."
00:13:47,00:13:48,"Oh, come on."
00:13:48,00:13:49,Yeah.
00:13:49,00:13:51,It's to train their palate.
00:13:51,00:13:53,So I guess it clears them.
00:13:53,00:13:54,It rots it up.
00:13:54,00:13:55,Maybe it releases sort of things.
00:13:55,00:13:56,But that's what they recommend.
00:13:56,00:13:58,It's this new book that's come out called Corkdork.
00:13:58,00:14:01,And that's what you call obsessive sommeliers.
00:14:01,00:14:02,Corkdorks.
00:14:02,00:14:03,Corkdorks.
00:14:03,00:14:04,Right.
00:14:04,00:14:06,"Yeah, so the Corkdorks, they lick rocks."
00:14:06,00:14:09,"They do tasting sessions at 10am, which they call tongue cardio."
00:14:09,00:14:10,What?
00:14:10,00:14:11,Tenam.
00:14:11,00:14:13,Tongue the magic out for the tongue.
00:14:13,00:14:14,Tongue cardio.
00:14:14,00:14:15,Yeah.
00:14:15,00:14:18,Can I just say one thing about tongue prints?
00:14:18,00:14:20,I read an article.
00:14:20,00:14:24,This was in a scientific journal about how tongue prints might be a good thing to use instead of fingerprints.
00:14:24,00:14:25,"Oh, wow."
00:14:25,00:14:30,And they said that it's good because you can stick it out of your mouth for inspection.
00:14:30,00:14:32,"Otherwise, it's well protected in your mouth."
00:14:32,00:14:36,"So, you know, you keep it protected, but then you can stick it out."
00:14:36,00:14:39,"It's difficult to forge, according to them."
00:14:39,00:14:47,"According to them, the act of physically reaching or thrusting it out is a convincing proof for liveness in a person as well."
00:14:47,00:14:48,That makes sense.
00:14:48,00:14:49,I've always said that.
00:14:49,00:14:55,"Whereas, if you're sort of in a passport queue and you're holding your person, you've just murdered by the art."
00:14:55,00:14:59,You can shove their finger onto the print thing and the one will be any of the wiser.
00:14:59,00:15:00,Exactly.
00:15:00,00:15:07,"And does it not suffer, though, from, remember, there's that fact about how people in pineapple factories were losing their fingerprints?"
00:15:07,00:15:08,Yeah.
00:15:08,00:15:10,Because of the acidic quality of the pineapple?
00:15:10,00:15:11,"There's an enzyme in it, yeah."
00:15:11,00:15:12,Yeah.
00:15:12,00:15:16,"And so, and isn't there another fact that pineapples kind of eat our tongues as we're eating it?"
00:15:16,00:15:20,"So, wouldn't you be altering your fingerprints every time you had a pineapple?"
00:15:20,00:15:24,"Yeah, but then it's the same problem with the fingerprints, so it's no more problems than you already had."
00:15:24,00:15:27,"Kind of, except all of us don't work in a pineapple factory."
00:15:27,00:15:32,"But all of us don't eat pineapples constantly, that presumably you're touching pineapples with your fingers as much as you're eating them,"
00:15:32,00:15:33,unless people are feeding you pineapples.
00:15:33,00:15:34,Got it.
00:15:34,00:15:41,"But I just, I would hate to, like, lose a case because the guy who rolled my house has a big lump of pineapples."
00:15:41,00:15:44,And what would he have left his tongue print?
00:15:44,00:15:47,"Unless, unless you had a collection of rocks that he loved."
00:15:47,00:15:49,"And he was a civilian, maybe."
00:15:49,00:15:52,It's some painting at my house.
00:15:52,00:15:56,What are you going to do with a tongue print?
00:15:56,00:15:58,"Look, if you're a sommelier."
00:15:58,00:16:01,You decide to rob a geologist else?
00:16:01,00:16:11,"Okay, it is time for fact number two."
00:16:11,00:16:12,And that is my fact.
00:16:12,00:16:16,"My fact this week is that Pope John Paul, the second's Pope mobile,"
00:16:16,00:16:21,can be hired out for stag do's and hen do's.
00:16:21,00:16:25,So this is the one that was built when he visited Ireland in 1979.
00:16:25,00:16:29,And it was built by these two guys who were given a brief to build it.
00:16:29,00:16:31,They weren't given too much money to build it.
00:16:31,00:16:33,So some of the things that...
00:16:33,00:16:37,"Well, it was a problem because some of the things that are attached to the modern Pope mobile,"
00:16:37,00:16:42,"that Pope Francis uses, i.e. bulletproof glass, was not affordable for the one,"
00:16:42,00:16:43,because no one was willing to pay for it.
00:16:43,00:16:45,"It cost like £200,000."
00:16:45,00:16:47,"They asked the government for the money, didn't they?"
00:16:47,00:16:48,But it never made it into their account.
00:16:48,00:16:51,"Yep, exactly. So instead they used shadowproof glass."
00:16:51,00:16:55,"And one of the builders said, so you know, if a fellow threw a stone at the vehicle,"
00:16:55,00:16:57,the glass wouldn't break.
00:16:57,00:17:00,That was the level of protection that the Irish Pope mobile was giving.
00:17:00,00:17:05,"But so yeah, so once he left, the Pope mobile remained in Ireland."
00:17:05,00:17:07,And it went to a museum. There were two of them.
00:17:07,00:17:12,And they decided that it would be fun to rent them out for stag do's and hen parties.
00:17:12,00:17:13,And that's what's done.
00:17:13,00:17:18,And it still includes the original chair that the Pope sat on inside the actual...
00:17:18,00:17:20,Is it like the...
00:17:20,00:17:23,Because I think of the Pope mobile as being basically a bubble.
00:17:23,00:17:26,"So yeah, you're thinking of like the golf buggy version of the Pope."
00:17:26,00:17:28,There's many like the Batmobile.
00:17:28,00:17:30,"There are many, many different versions."
00:17:30,00:17:32,"Oh, there's only one version of the Batmobile."
00:17:32,00:17:35,"No, there's plenty. You've got the Adam West Batmobile."
00:17:35,00:17:37,"But they all work the same, don't they?"
00:17:37,00:17:38,They look nothing like each other.
00:17:38,00:17:39,They're all black.
00:17:39,00:17:40,"No, they're not."
00:17:40,00:17:41,They're basically the same.
00:17:41,00:17:43,"Guys, they're not. Look at photos."
00:17:43,00:17:45,A covely we're having this chat. They are completely different.
00:17:45,00:17:47,How do you know it's a Batmobile then?
00:17:47,00:17:48,Because Batmans in it.
00:17:48,00:17:49,There are two.
00:17:49,00:17:52,Does any car become a Batmobile then?
00:17:52,00:17:53,"Yeah, for the purposes."
00:17:53,00:17:55,"So if I gave him a lift in my mini,"
00:17:55,00:17:56,do you have to become a Batmobile?
00:17:56,00:17:58,"Yeah, if he has to get a train to a crime,"
00:17:58,00:17:59,does that become a Batmobile?
00:17:59,00:18:02,"It's still mobile, so it would be a mobile."
00:18:02,00:18:04,He has a Batcopter.
00:18:04,00:18:05,The helicopter.
00:18:05,00:18:06,Right. Yeah.
00:18:06,00:18:07,So there's...
00:18:07,00:18:09,You just put Batman in it and it belongs to it.
00:18:09,00:18:11,"So, same with the Pope, same deal with the Pope."
00:18:11,00:18:13,You put Pope in any car.
00:18:13,00:18:14,It's a Batmobile.
00:18:14,00:18:14,Yeah.
00:18:14,00:18:16,So what do these staggered-handies?
00:18:16,00:18:18,Because surely it can only fit one person in it.
00:18:18,00:18:19,"No, it's a pretty boring stag."
00:18:19,00:18:21,"No, you cut the stag in it."
00:18:21,00:18:23,And that everyone else stands either side of it.
00:18:23,00:18:25,Kind of throws rocks at it.
00:18:25,00:18:30,So what it had was a sort of a truck-like area
00:18:30,00:18:33,where 15 people could sit inside including the Pope.
00:18:33,00:18:35,And then it had a balcony of sorts
00:18:35,00:18:37,where the Pope came out to on the front
00:18:37,00:18:39,to wave to people with a hand railings
00:18:39,00:18:41,to make sure it didn't fall.
00:18:41,00:18:43,That's why it can be lent out to stag do's
00:18:43,00:18:46,because up to 15 people or 16 people can be inside of it.
00:18:46,00:18:49,"But of course, it was 300 euros an hour to rent, wasn't it?"
00:18:49,00:18:50,Yes.
00:18:50,00:18:53,And they kind of suss out what kind of stag do you're going to be?
00:18:53,00:18:55,Because obviously they want a bit of respect
00:18:55,00:18:57,in the Pope's chair.
00:18:57,00:19:00,"Yeah, they said we'll be selective about who we choose."
00:19:00,00:19:01,Will they?
00:19:01,00:19:03,I don't know how selective you can be with stag do's.
00:19:03,00:19:05,And then there's marketing itself as a stag do.
00:19:05,00:19:06,"Oh, I don't know."
00:19:06,00:19:09,I've been on some pretty respectful stag do's.
00:19:09,00:19:12,You were only invited for the admin though.
00:19:12,00:19:16,I did the accounts and the billing stuff in the corner.
00:19:16,00:19:18,"Oh, dear."
00:19:18,00:19:22,But Pope John Paul said he didn't even like the name Pope Mobile.
00:19:22,00:19:24,He asked the media not to use the word Pope Mobile
00:19:24,00:19:26,because he thought it was undignified.
00:19:26,00:19:28,So imagine if he could have found out
00:19:28,00:19:30,what would happen to it after that.
00:19:30,00:19:32,"And same with Pope Francis in the modern one,"
00:19:32,00:19:34,they all hate the word Pope Mobile
00:19:34,00:19:36,I think it sounds as you say a bit sort of.
00:19:36,00:19:38,"Actually, Pope Francis doesn't like it at all, does he?"
00:19:38,00:19:39,He's very modest.
00:19:39,00:19:42,And he thinks that you shouldn't be rolling around
00:19:42,00:19:44,"in this ground thing, especially for you."
00:19:44,00:19:47,And he mostly just uses the vehicles that the Vatican has.
00:19:47,00:19:49,It's got like a bunch of vehicles he can rent out.
00:19:49,00:19:51,He drives himself around town on his own.
00:19:51,00:19:53,He prefers to be out in the open.
00:19:53,00:19:56,So he has an open top because there was an assassination attempt.
00:19:56,00:19:58,And so since then they were often billet proof and stuff.
00:19:58,00:20:01,"But he's like, no, I want to feel close to my people."
00:20:01,00:20:03,So he just stands in an open top car.
00:20:03,00:20:06,He told reporters it's true anything could happen.
00:20:06,00:20:07,"But let's face it, am I age?"
00:20:07,00:20:08,I don't have much to lose.
00:20:08,00:20:09,Yeah.
00:20:09,00:20:10,So they're very relaxed actually.
00:20:10,00:20:11,Yeah.
00:20:11,00:20:13,"And so the current one that he has,"
00:20:13,00:20:15,you always see it going at about 10 miles an hour.
00:20:15,00:20:18,"But if it needs to make a sudden escape,"
00:20:18,00:20:20,it can go up to 160 miles per hour.
00:20:20,00:20:24,"Yeah, it could just jet away at 160."
00:20:24,00:20:26,"I think that was the last place, wasn't it?"
00:20:26,00:20:27,The golf buggy type one.
00:20:27,00:20:28,"Oh, yeah, yeah."
00:20:28,00:20:29,No way.
00:20:29,00:20:32,That's something that an aerodynamic could get into.
00:20:32,00:20:35,"Yeah, I'm 160, yeah."
00:20:35,00:20:36,It's a puzzle.
00:20:36,00:20:39,I think wings come out the side and it just balances it.
00:20:39,00:20:40,But he's not driving it.
00:20:40,00:20:42,So he'll just sit in the box.
00:20:42,00:20:43,"No, no."
00:20:43,00:20:44,"No, it doesn't drive the Colombian."
00:20:44,00:20:47,"I thought he said, no, that's your mix of your Batman."
00:20:47,00:20:48,You said he drives himself around.
00:20:48,00:20:49,No.
00:20:49,00:20:50,Do you mean in his little car?
00:20:50,00:20:51,I said that.
00:20:51,00:20:52,"And that's the latest one drives himself around,"
00:20:52,00:20:53,just in the rental car.
00:20:53,00:20:54,Just rents a car.
00:20:54,00:20:57,"It's the Vatican, special Vatican cars that they have."
00:20:57,00:20:59,"And they have their own license plates, don't they?"
00:20:59,00:21:00,Yeah.
00:21:00,00:21:01,They all have a special Vatican city license plate.
00:21:01,00:21:02,The license plates.
00:21:02,00:21:06,"Number Cv1, which stands for Stato de la Chita de El Vaticanto,"
00:21:06,00:21:08,which just means Vatican City basically.
00:21:08,00:21:11,"But the locals, the local joke in Rome is that it stands for"
00:21:11,00:21:13,"say, Cristo Videsi."
00:21:13,00:21:16,"Hang on, James."
00:21:16,00:21:17,Let me explain.
00:21:17,00:21:19,You don't need to explain the joke.
00:21:19,00:21:20,"No, you're right."
00:21:20,00:21:21,Let's move on.
00:21:21,00:21:22,"Can you explain it, please?"
00:21:22,00:21:24,"It just means, say, Cristo Videsi."
00:21:24,00:21:26,It just means if only Christ could see this.
00:21:26,00:21:28,It's a joke about the Pope being flash.
00:21:28,00:21:29,"No, I get it."
00:21:29,00:21:30,"Oh, God."
00:21:30,00:21:31,Let's move on.
00:21:31,00:21:35,These two guys who built this original Pope were built
00:21:35,00:21:36,that we were talking about.
00:21:36,00:21:37,Yeah.
00:21:37,00:21:39,They owned this company called O.B.A.M.
00:21:39,00:21:42,and they were the biggest vehicle builders in the country
00:21:42,00:21:43,at the time.
00:21:43,00:21:47,They claimed to be the first people to make refrigerated trucks in Ireland.
00:21:47,00:21:49,And this is the origin story of the company.
00:21:49,00:21:52,They were in town one day having a pint.
00:21:52,00:21:55,"When they got a bus home, they noticed there were trucks going up and down the road"
00:21:55,00:21:59,"and said, ""Why, we should start doing a business making trucks."""
00:21:59,00:22:02,And then they became the biggest truck makers in Ireland.
00:22:02,00:22:03,Wow.
00:22:03,00:22:04,And made the Pope reveal.
00:22:04,00:22:06,Awesome origin story.
00:22:06,00:22:07,Right.
00:22:07,00:22:11,"And the other thing about this Pope reveal, the original one that we were talking about,"
00:22:11,00:22:14,is there is a place to keep a gun.
00:22:14,00:22:21,And that was because US Archbishop Pail Masinkus was with the Pope at the time.
00:22:21,00:22:24,And he always carried a gun with him wherever he went.
00:22:24,00:22:25,I love the sound of this gun.
00:22:25,00:22:30,"And this guy, a deranged priest, attacked him once with a bayonet."
00:22:30,00:22:31,Wow.
00:22:31,00:22:32,And so he always kept a gun by his side.
00:22:32,00:22:33,Attack the Pope.
00:22:33,00:22:34,He was going for the Pope.
00:22:34,00:22:35,What?
00:22:35,00:22:36,A deranged priest.
00:22:36,00:22:37,Beautiful words.
00:22:37,00:22:39,Ran at the Pope with a bayonet.
00:22:39,00:22:44,"And this guy, Masinkus, managed to thwart him."
00:22:44,00:22:47,With his gun.
00:22:47,00:22:49,"No, with his bare fists."
00:22:49,00:22:50,Okay.
00:22:50,00:22:53,"And then from then on, when they built the Pope mobile, they built this little pouch"
00:22:53,00:22:56,that he could have his gun in there.
00:22:56,00:23:00,"The last time that there was an assassination attempt on the Pope,"
00:23:00,00:23:03,it was this guy called Mehmet Ali Adce.
00:23:03,00:23:05,And it was in 1981.
00:23:05,00:23:08,And he'd actually escaped from prison in Turkey for another murder.
00:23:08,00:23:11,But he tried to kill the Pope and he went to prison.
00:23:11,00:23:12,And he's been let out now.
00:23:12,00:23:13,And he's done a bunch of things.
00:23:13,00:23:16,"First of all, he said he wants to meet the current Pope."
00:23:16,00:23:17,But he already had that.
00:23:17,00:23:18,Bring him over.
00:23:18,00:23:20,"No, but he feels really bad."
00:23:20,00:23:23,And the other Pope who retired as well.
00:23:23,00:23:26,Can they get that open-roof car that the love's getting in?
00:23:26,00:23:28,He's seen the error of his way.
00:23:28,00:23:30,So he also wants to convert Catholicism.
00:23:30,00:23:33,And one of the first things he did was he went and laid some roses
00:23:33,00:23:37,"at the John Paul II's tomb, who is the guy that he tried to assassinate."
00:23:37,00:23:40,"But he's also said, in 2010, he said, by the way, guys,"
00:23:40,00:23:42,I'm up for killing Osama bin London.
00:23:42,00:23:43,If you guys want me to.
00:23:43,00:23:46,You may just dress him as the Pope.
00:23:46,00:23:50,I think you're all being really cynical about it.
00:23:50,00:23:52,"He's recently reformed, man."
00:23:52,00:23:56,"He's also approached Dan Brown, because he wants to write a book with him."
00:23:56,00:23:57,What?
00:23:57,00:24:01,"Yeah, he wants to write a book of his life and adventures as a potential Pope assassin."
00:24:01,00:24:04,"But yeah, so I quite like that all these countries around the world"
00:24:04,00:24:06,have Pope mobiles waiting to go.
00:24:06,00:24:10,So occasionally they bring a Pope mobile in a plane
00:24:10,00:24:12,if the Pope is visiting a country.
00:24:12,00:24:18,"So like the beast, like how the American president has the big beast car"
00:24:18,00:24:20,that gets taken over season in the planes.
00:24:20,00:24:21,They do that.
00:24:21,00:24:24,"But most countries like Ireland have one, well, Ireland used to have one already."
00:24:24,00:24:26,I don't think they'll be using that one.
00:24:26,00:24:27,Pope Francis is next to him.
00:24:27,00:24:29,So just wipe it down.
00:24:29,00:24:32,"Okay, we need to have it returned Pope by seven,"
00:24:32,00:24:35,because there's a stagdew for Nikki going on.
00:24:41,00:24:44,"Okay, it's time for fact number three."
00:24:44,00:24:46,And that is Andy.
00:24:46,00:24:49,My fact is that there is no such thing as a manta ray.
00:24:49,00:24:53,"Okay, so just to clarify what a manta ray is before I blow your minds."
00:24:53,00:24:54,It's a type of fish.
00:24:54,00:24:55,It's a type of fish.
00:24:55,00:24:57,Of which there is no such thing.
00:24:57,00:24:58,Yes.
00:24:58,00:25:01,"And this is another thing, which is already part of a no such thing thing,"
00:25:01,00:25:03,which is also a no such thing.
00:25:03,00:25:04,"Exactly, yes."
00:25:04,00:25:07,"It's become kind of an anti-matter podcast, doesn't it?"
00:25:07,00:25:09,Dark matter podcast.
00:25:09,00:25:12,So there is a new paper out about these things.
00:25:12,00:25:13,Manta rays.
00:25:13,00:25:15,And you'll know what I mean when I say Manta ray.
00:25:15,00:25:19,The absolutely massive sales shaped fish that swim through the water.
00:25:19,00:25:20,They're really huge.
00:25:20,00:25:24,Sometimes you'll see it on the sidebar of the internet with one behind a lady in a bikini.
00:25:24,00:25:26,"Yes, it's a very popular meme."
00:25:26,00:25:29,It's a photo that was taken where three people were having the photo in the ocean
00:25:29,00:25:31,and suddenly behind them.
00:25:31,00:25:34,Manta ray rises up and is photo bombing them.
00:25:34,00:25:35,"Oh, that's very nice."
00:25:35,00:25:37,"Okay, well, those things don't exist, basically."
00:25:37,00:25:41,So there's a new study in the zoological Journal of the Linae in society.
00:25:41,00:25:43,And there are two species of Manta ray.
00:25:43,00:25:46,And there are nine species of Manta ray.
00:25:46,00:25:50,And this paper is arguing that Manta rays have basically been miscategorised
00:25:50,00:25:52,and that they actually all fit into Manta ray.
00:25:52,00:25:54,"They're saying, basically, that they're all the same thing."
00:25:54,00:25:57,"But because Manta rays were named first,"
00:25:57,00:25:59,that everything has to be called Manta ray.
00:25:59,00:26:02,Because you're always named after the first thing that gets named.
00:26:02,00:26:03,Yes.
00:26:03,00:26:06,"And these are not different enough, basically, to be their own genus."
00:26:06,00:26:10,"But the problem is, Manta ray is not very common word."
00:26:10,00:26:13,Whereas Manta ray is a relatively common word.
00:26:13,00:26:16,"So people are just going to carry on calling the Manta rays,"
00:26:16,00:26:18,even though they're not really called that.
00:26:18,00:26:21,"I think even I may do, just by the fact that this is my fact this week."
00:26:21,00:26:23,"No, I think we should start the campaign."
00:26:23,00:26:25,"Mobulas are funnier word, I think."
00:26:25,00:26:26,Mobula ray.
00:26:26,00:26:28,"Mobulas a bit on a matter of peak, as well."
00:26:28,00:26:31,"I bet they make a sound a little bit like ""Mobula in the water."""
00:26:31,00:26:32,Do you think we do?
00:26:32,00:26:34,Do you think they name themselves?
00:26:34,00:26:36,"Yeah, I see, isn't that what we'll fish to?"
00:26:36,00:26:38,We'll ask them what they're called.
00:26:38,00:26:40,"They tell you, then you kill them and put them in a museum."
00:26:40,00:26:41,Yeah.
00:26:41,00:26:46,"Unless you name them Alfred, which is what the reef mantra is called."
00:26:46,00:26:47,What?
00:26:47,00:26:48,What?
00:26:48,00:26:49,It's called Alfred. It's called Manta Alfredi.
00:26:49,00:26:50,"Oh, that's cool."
00:26:50,00:26:52,This is named after Batman's Butler.
00:26:52,00:26:53,"That's right, yeah."
00:26:53,00:27:00,"No, it's named after Queen Victoria's son Alfred."
00:27:00,00:27:02,He was the first British Royal to visit Australia.
00:27:02,00:27:07,"So, they were so excited about getting a proper royal over that they named a mantra after."
00:27:07,00:27:12,"We actually got an email about this a couple of weeks ago from a guy called Rich Horner,"
00:27:12,00:27:16,who works out in Bali at the exact spot where they were doing all these tests.
00:27:16,00:27:19,"I mean, he works out in Bali, or he works out in Bali."
00:27:19,00:27:24,He works out in Bali and between Jim Sessions wrote us an email.
00:27:24,00:27:28,"So, he wrote us an email saying he's been dying to tell us this range,"
00:27:28,00:27:31,because he listens to our podcast and has been known for a while.
00:27:31,00:27:34,"So, he said, ""News just in, there's no such thing as a mantra ray."
00:27:34,00:27:38,"They've just been reclassified as big devil rays, brackets, modular rays."
00:27:38,00:27:44,"After DNA study of them, I work in Bali on Nusa Lembongan, which I believe is an area."
00:27:44,00:27:46,"That's pronounced differently."""
00:27:46,00:27:51,"Where we work with Marine Megaforn, a foundation team, to ID the mantra rays here,"
00:27:51,00:27:53,creating a database of them all.
00:27:53,00:27:56,We thought we had 30 to 40 of them 10 years ago.
00:27:56,00:27:59,"But by using their unique spot patterns on their chest and belly,"
00:27:59,00:28:03,we worked out that there were over 600 individuals here on our island.
00:28:03,00:28:06,"So, the project was set up there by Andrea Marshall."
00:28:06,00:28:11,Andrea Marshall was a subject of a natural history documentary called Andrea Queen of the Mantis.
00:28:11,00:28:14,"And she was visiting the other day, giving us an update,"
00:28:14,00:28:17,"presentation on her current research, and then drop the bombshell"
00:28:17,00:28:22,that her geneticist colleagues were writing a paper describing them as just big devil rays.
00:28:22,00:28:24,I've been itching to tell you guys this for ages.
00:28:24,00:28:25,There we go.
00:28:25,00:28:26,Oh yeah.
00:28:26,00:28:28,"And he's offered that if we want to go swimming with these new modular rays,"
00:28:28,00:28:30,"we're more than welcome to him, Bali."
00:28:30,00:28:31,Yes.
00:28:31,00:28:32,Yes please.
00:28:32,00:28:33,Yes please.
00:28:33,00:28:36,Do you think was there a huge gasp in the conference where she announced
00:28:36,00:28:38,that actually mantar rays were just devil rays?
00:28:38,00:28:41,I reckon some people stoned out.
00:28:41,00:28:42,I think you're right.
00:28:42,00:28:43,A few fainted maybe.
00:28:43,00:28:44,That's what it is big news.
00:28:44,00:28:45,It's huge news.
00:28:45,00:28:46,Study.
00:28:46,00:28:48,So you find out that they're actually just big deer.
00:28:48,00:28:49,Yeah.
00:28:49,00:28:50,That is huge.
00:28:50,00:28:51,That's what it is like.
00:28:51,00:28:56,But there must be like people who study mobulas and people who study mantas.
00:28:56,00:28:57,Yeah.
00:28:57,00:28:59,And now there's only one job for those two people.
00:28:59,00:29:00,Yeah.
00:29:00,00:29:01,Yeah.
00:29:01,00:29:02,Yeah.
00:29:02,00:29:03,Sacking's a hoi.
00:29:03,00:29:05,Do you know they mate in a train?
00:29:05,00:29:06,In a train?
00:29:06,00:29:09,In a train of mantar rays.
00:29:09,00:29:10,So like a conger line.
00:29:10,00:29:11,A conger line.
00:29:11,00:29:12,Yeah.
00:29:12,00:29:15,God you've been in some pretty spicy parties.
00:29:15,00:29:20,"If they're mating in a train, doesn't that mean you're always mating with someone"
00:29:20,00:29:23,"who's actually mating with someone else, who's actually mating with someone else?"
00:29:23,00:29:26,"Oh, and is there always some poor mobular ray at the front?"
00:29:26,00:29:28,He's not getting any action.
00:29:28,00:29:30,Unless they do it in a ring.
00:29:30,00:29:31,"Yes, unless it's a ring."
00:29:31,00:29:32,Is it a ring?
00:29:32,00:29:33,That wouldn't be a train.
00:29:33,00:29:34,That'd be a weird train.
00:29:34,00:29:36,It would be like a model rail.
00:29:36,00:29:37,Yeah.
00:29:37,00:29:39,I've got the answer here.
00:29:39,00:29:40,We'll take it.
00:29:40,00:29:43,"So no, it's up to 30 males follow around one female."
00:29:43,00:29:44,Right.
00:29:44,00:29:46,And she leads them on a dance.
00:29:46,00:29:50,And she tests their endurance to see if they're fit enough to breathe with her.
00:29:50,00:29:52,And eventually she selects one.
00:29:52,00:29:54,She does a load of cool swooshy moves through the water.
00:29:54,00:29:56,"So here's where she bit like the conger, isn't it?"
00:29:56,00:29:57,There's a bit like the conger.
00:29:57,00:29:59,The person at the front says challenges.
00:29:59,00:30:00,"What they do are dance, don't they?"
00:30:00,00:30:01,Yeah.
00:30:01,00:30:02,You follow in the leg.
00:30:02,00:30:03,Yeah.
00:30:03,00:30:06,"And if you stay until the end, you get to have sex with someone."
00:30:06,00:30:07,Is that it?
00:30:07,00:30:08,That's how it works.
00:30:08,00:30:09,I love the conger.
00:30:09,00:30:14,And eventually the female at the front of the conger selects a single male and they mate.
00:30:14,00:30:15,That's cool.
00:30:15,00:30:19,"They are very social and they hang out sort of in groups together, don't they?"
00:30:19,00:30:26,"So they eat socially, like humans, a bit, sort of, in that they do what's called stacking."
00:30:26,00:30:28,So there's one man to ray that will be at the front.
00:30:28,00:30:31,And that's the one who's doing most of the feeding.
00:30:31,00:30:34,And then he'll eat a lot of she will eat a lot of the plankton.
00:30:34,00:30:37,And then the other plankton will be whipped around his body.
00:30:37,00:30:40,And then we'll feed into the gaping mouths of the people behind him.
00:30:40,00:30:42,And they switch roundtos at the front.
00:30:42,00:30:44,So they just take it in turn to get us to be the prime feed.
00:30:44,00:30:45,Very nice.
00:30:45,00:30:46,It's really sweet.
00:30:46,00:30:47,Yeah.
00:30:47,00:30:48,Not if you're a plankton.
00:30:48,00:30:49,"No, that's true."
00:30:49,00:30:50,No one ever thinks about a plankton.
00:30:50,00:30:52,"No one thought if you're a plankton, yeah."
00:30:52,00:30:54,Do you think you've got past one of them?
00:30:54,00:30:55,I feel like thank God for that.
00:30:55,00:30:57,And then another one comes out already.
00:30:57,00:30:58,I see.
00:30:58,00:31:03,"There is an article called ""How do you stick a camera on a man to ray that I read?"""
00:31:03,00:31:05,Do you know how you do that?
00:31:05,00:31:06,No.
00:31:06,00:31:07,Can I see it quickly?
00:31:07,00:31:11,"Oh, I mean, I read that they're naturally incredibly mucousy."
00:31:11,00:31:14,So wouldn't it just... they're coated in mucous.
00:31:14,00:31:15,You lure them with that.
00:31:15,00:31:18,That's what you do.
00:31:18,00:31:21,"No, is it that you just pop it on them in the mucous?"
00:31:21,00:31:22,No.
00:31:22,00:31:24,"Well, that's one of the problems."
00:31:24,00:31:29,"So if they usually put things on fish like with a suction cup,"
00:31:29,00:31:34,but the skin of the man to ray doesn't really allow for that falls off quite quickly.
00:31:34,00:31:38,And so there was some scientists and they had some peanut butter with them.
00:31:38,00:31:42,"So they decided to smear peanut butter on the camera, on the suction pad."
00:31:42,00:31:45,"And it worked, miles better, and they stay on for like four or five hours now."
00:31:45,00:31:46,Wow!
00:31:46,00:31:47,That's amazing.
00:31:47,00:31:48,Yeah.
00:31:48,00:31:49,That's brilliant.
00:31:49,00:31:53,"Why do scientists have peanut butter, but not an adhesive, a scientific kind of glue?"
00:31:53,00:31:54,Crunchy or smooth?
00:31:54,00:31:57,"Well, that's the real question."
00:31:57,00:31:59,"Sorry, answer that."
00:31:59,00:32:02,I'll start with that as a question.
00:32:02,00:32:07,"I think with proper adhesive, it might be difficult because it might be toxic, I suppose."
00:32:07,00:32:09,Or you don't want it to stay on forever.
00:32:09,00:32:11,It's quite good that it comes off after a few hours.
00:32:11,00:32:12,Yeah.
00:32:12,00:32:13,All right.
00:32:13,00:32:14,I'll allow it.
00:32:14,00:32:15,I've forgotten what Dan's question was.
00:32:15,00:32:16,Crunchy or smooth.
00:32:16,00:32:19,I actually deliberately forgot about that.
00:32:19,00:32:20,"Oh, sorry, sorry."
00:32:20,00:32:21,"It must be smooth, right?"
00:32:21,00:32:22,Yeah.
00:32:22,00:32:28,There is one amazing website called elazmo-research.com.
00:32:28,00:32:32,And it just has a Q&A section about man to rays.
00:32:32,00:32:36,"It reads like it was written by a man to ray, basically."
00:32:36,00:32:39,It's just complete nonsense.
00:32:39,00:32:43,"No, it says, ""Is it true man to rays have rescued fishermen?"""
00:32:43,00:32:46,And the answer is probably not.
00:32:46,00:32:50,"If, apart from breathing season, man to rays are not terribly interested in one another,"
00:32:50,00:32:55,they're probably not interested in a hapless fisherman either.
00:32:55,00:32:56,I know.
00:32:56,00:32:58,"They can recognise themselves in a mirror, we think."
00:32:58,00:32:59,We think.
00:32:59,00:33:00,We're not sure.
00:33:00,00:33:04,"But if that is true, that is massive, because no fish has ever been shown to recognise itself in a mirror."
00:33:04,00:33:11,"So when you say we think, it's about how they act in front of the mirror as opposed to acting in front of another man to ray."
00:33:11,00:33:15,"So for instance, if I was to put a spot, I've got a marker in my hand."
00:33:15,00:33:18,"If I was to put a spot on your forehead and then showed you a mirror,"
00:33:18,00:33:22,"you would likely, because you're an intelligent human, kind of try and wipe it off."
00:33:22,00:33:23,Got it.
00:33:23,00:33:29,"And so if you did it to an animal, if you did it to, let's say, a shrew and put a dot on the head,"
00:33:29,00:33:33,"they wouldn't recognise that it's their head with the dot on it, so they wouldn't try and wipe it off."
00:33:33,00:33:35,"If you did it to some primates, they would."
00:33:35,00:33:36,"If you did it to an elephant, they would."
00:33:36,00:33:39,"And I think what you're saying is, 'Manta ray wood' as well."
00:33:39,00:33:42,"Well, although the way they tested it with the 'Manta rays' this time."
00:33:42,00:33:46,"Excuse me, you've just got a little bit of..."
00:33:46,00:33:48,...was nothing as advanced as that.
00:33:48,00:33:51,They said that they put a mirror in front of the 'Manta rays'.
00:33:51,00:33:56,"And they noticed that the 'Manta rays', first of all, they didn't seem to try and attack or interact with the thing in the mirror,"
00:33:56,00:33:58,which implied that they knew it wasn't another 'Manta ray'.
00:33:58,00:34:04,"Right. And second of all, they blew bubbles and made odd body movements as if they were showing off their own bodies in front of the mirror."
00:34:04,00:34:06,Wow. I believe it. I completely dig it.
00:34:06,00:34:09,"And I think they do save fishermen, actually."
00:34:09,00:34:13,I think they're very sweet.
00:34:13,00:34:23,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Chazinski."
00:34:23,00:34:30,"My fact is that the former mayor of Bogota once hired 420 My Martists to make fun of traffic violators,"
00:34:30,00:34:34,because he believed Columbians fear ridicule more than they fear punishment.
00:34:34,00:34:37,What was he called?
00:34:37,00:34:39,He's called 'Antanus mocus'.
00:34:39,00:34:41,I call him 'Antanus mocus'.
00:34:41,00:34:43,"I bet you do, yeah. It's not his name."
00:34:43,00:34:45,"Oh, my God, he's called 'mocus'. I know."
00:34:45,00:34:47,I know. People to make fun of other people.
00:34:47,00:34:48,"It's perfect, isn't it?"
00:34:48,00:34:53,I think next he's going to get 'Antanus' is not his name.
00:34:53,00:34:57,"Anyway, this guy, 'Antanus mocus', is such an awesome guy."
00:34:57,00:35:01,"And so he was mayor at a number of times, and he changed Bogota in so many good ways."
00:35:01,00:35:03,So this policy really worked.
00:35:03,00:35:08,"He fired all the traffic police, because they were known for being very corrupt and taking lots of bribes."
00:35:08,00:35:11,"And he, at first, he replaced them with just 20 My Martists."
00:35:11,00:35:15,"And they would do things like they'd, if a pedestrian crossed the road at the wrong time,"
00:35:15,00:35:19,"or if someone was waiting in traffic and is about to skip a red light,"
00:35:19,00:35:23,the My Martists sort of chased them or go up to their window and like make mocking gestures at them.
00:35:23,00:35:28,"And they found that it really worked, and it reduced reckless driving and reckless pedestrianing."
00:35:28,00:35:30,And so he added 400 more.
00:35:30,00:35:33,"But if you hired MIMES to replace your traffic cops,"
00:35:33,00:35:35,I think of traffic cops as basically MIMES.
00:35:35,00:35:36,"Yeah, they are."
00:35:36,00:35:39,"They're just sort of doing the gesturing, like, come on or no, you stop over here."
00:35:39,00:35:42,"Yeah, when they're doing stop, it's like they're in a tiny invisible box."
00:35:42,00:35:44,"Yeah, exactly."
00:35:44,00:35:49,"If you fail the MIME exams, do you bump down and become a traffic cop?"
00:35:49,00:35:51,"Yeah, that's how it goes."
00:35:51,00:35:56,"The other thing about that is, if you like MIMES, I don't think that many people do like MIMES,"
00:35:56,00:36:01,"but if you like them, maybe you would deliberately break the rules so that they came over and..."
00:36:01,00:36:02,You know when you're driving?
00:36:02,00:36:03,Yeah.
00:36:03,00:36:08,"...and there's like an electronic sign, and if you're going over 30 miles an hour, it does a little sad face."
00:36:08,00:36:09,Yeah.
00:36:09,00:36:12,"You might deliberately go at 31 miles an hour, so that I get the sad face."
00:36:12,00:36:13,It might be like that.
00:36:13,00:36:14,Because you like sad faces.
00:36:14,00:36:15,Yeah.
00:36:15,00:36:17,But it does a happy face if you go under.
00:36:17,00:36:18,"Yeah, who wants a happy face?"
00:36:18,00:36:19,"No, it's yeah."
00:36:19,00:36:21,No wonder my text messages from you are so passive.
00:36:21,00:36:28,See you later on a frown.
00:36:28,00:36:32,"Yeah, he is an amazing character, isn't he?"
00:36:32,00:36:33,"Oh, thank you."
00:36:35,00:36:43,"He used to go round in the streets wearing a Superman outfit, claiming to be a character called Super Citizen."
00:36:43,00:36:46,He's just one of those crazy cool guys.
00:36:46,00:36:48,He didn't just do that for no reason.
00:36:48,00:36:50,He did that while cleaning up the streets.
00:36:50,00:36:51,"Yeah, it's cleaning up the streets of crime."
00:36:51,00:36:53,"He would like, well, I think it was rubbish."
00:36:53,00:36:57,"That is a crime though, dropping rubbish."
00:36:57,00:37:01,"But that's not what Batman means, so he says he's cleaning the streets."
00:37:01,00:37:05,"That's Batman's day job, actually. That's how he made all those billions."
00:37:05,00:37:08,Get the bad recycling like old bottles.
00:37:08,00:37:14,"No one's on as you can bring mugs back when you've drunk your mold wine, you get two pounds back."
00:37:14,00:37:15,That's how he makes his money.
00:37:15,00:37:17,To the bad bottle bin.
00:37:17,00:37:21,"Yeah, so he did that."
00:37:21,00:37:26,"He also did a really cool thing, which is he launched this idea, which was called A Night for Women."
00:37:26,00:37:31,"And the idea was that all the city's men stayed at home in the evening, caring for the children."
00:37:31,00:37:35,"And the city's 700,000 women would go out."
00:37:35,00:37:37,I'm Tim.
00:37:37,00:37:39,And Tim dressed as Superman.
00:37:39,00:37:43,"Wow, that is just an interesting character, isn't he?"
00:37:43,00:37:46,"And the idea of being that women felt uncomfortable sometimes,"
00:37:46,00:37:49,because some people thought that some parts bogged out were dangerous at the time.
00:37:49,00:37:52,And they feel much more comfortable if they go out and they don't see any men around.
00:37:52,00:37:54,Which I can tell you guys.
00:37:54,00:37:58,I'm so glad you're here to actually qualify the things I've said.
00:37:58,00:38:01,I've just gone for the headlight.
00:38:01,00:38:04,And it really worked.
00:38:04,00:38:10,So he cut homicide rates by 70% and he cut traffic fatalities by 50%.
00:38:10,00:38:12,And he was actually a mathematician.
00:38:12,00:38:15,"So the reason people, part of the reason people liked him was that he was a mass professor,"
00:38:15,00:38:20,"who actually was sort of fired from sort of had to quit his job in 1993,"
00:38:20,00:38:24,because he was giving a lecture and the students in his lecture theatre weren't listening very hard.
00:38:24,00:38:27,And so he dropped his trousers and mooned them all.
00:38:27,00:38:30,And shortly afterwards resigned from the post of mass professor at the university.
00:38:30,00:38:33,And instead became there.
00:38:33,00:38:35,"He said when they asked him about that,"
00:38:35,00:38:39,he said innovative behaviour can be useful when you run out of words.
00:38:39,00:38:40,There you go.
00:38:40,00:38:41,And that was his thing.
00:38:41,00:38:43,"He was saying no one's listening to me, no matter what I say."
00:38:43,00:38:45,So I'm going to show them my ass.
00:38:45,00:38:46,And maybe they'll listen.
00:38:46,00:38:48,"And that's like Anna says, that's how he became famous."
00:38:48,00:38:51,"And then once he became famous, then he started going into politics."
00:38:51,00:38:55,But hiring the mind sounds like he's also run out of words there.
00:38:55,00:38:58,"You know, he's hiring people who want using words to solve another problem."
00:38:58,00:38:59,He's a man of action.
00:38:59,00:39:00,Yeah.
00:39:00,00:39:01,He sounds amazing.
00:39:01,00:39:02,Yeah.
00:39:02,00:39:03,He is awesome.
00:39:03,00:39:08,"He brought the amount of money that was earned for the city way up, didn't he?"
00:39:08,00:39:09,"Yeah, taxation."
00:39:09,00:39:11,He said people could have a voluntary tax.
00:39:11,00:39:12,That's right.
00:39:12,00:39:14,Volunted to pay 10% more tax and thousands of people did.
00:39:14,00:39:20,Yeah. So another thing he did is that he asked people to call his office if they came across a very honest taxi driver.
00:39:20,00:39:21,Because he wanted to.
00:39:21,00:39:27,150 people called and he organised to meet them all.
00:39:27,00:39:31,"And he came up with a group name for them, which was the Knights of the Zebra."
00:39:31,00:39:37,And the idea was that they were just giving good impressions of good taxi drivers who exist on the beaten.
00:39:37,00:39:40,"If you were good, you might then become a Knight of the Zebra."
00:39:40,00:39:43,Wow. Yeah. That's quite good.
00:39:43,00:39:45,"Which is a seriously cool title, which you definitely would try to be."
00:39:45,00:39:49,"If I was called a Knight of the Zebra, I would be better at my job than I am."
00:39:49,00:39:52,I was reading a bit about Mimes for this fact.
00:39:52,00:39:53,"Oh, yeah."
00:39:53,00:40:00,"Did you know that Marcel Maso, that pretty much the only mind anyone can ever name?"
00:40:00,00:40:03,He wants released an album.
00:40:03,00:40:05,Call the best of Marcel Maso.
00:40:05,00:40:06,"No, he didn't."
00:40:06,00:40:07,"No, as well."
00:40:07,00:40:09,"So, well, I'm getting to that, Dan."
00:40:09,00:40:10,Okay.
00:40:10,00:40:12,"There was once an album release called The Best of Marcel Maso,"
00:40:12,00:40:15,which was 19 minutes of silence in the moment of applause.
00:40:15,00:40:17,And then the other side was exactly the same.
00:40:17,00:40:18,That's very good.
00:40:18,00:40:21,But it was produced as a joke by MGM.
00:40:21,00:40:24,"And his name was slightly misspelled on it, so we think it was name."
00:40:24,00:40:25,But...
00:40:25,00:40:26,"But, but, but, but, but, but."
00:40:26,00:40:27,This is true.
00:40:27,00:40:32,Could not perform because the sound system failed.
00:40:32,00:40:33,Really?
00:40:33,00:40:37,"Yeah, he was doing a sketch in a show in America in 1980."
00:40:37,00:40:40,"And it was a company by music, but then the music didn't work."
00:40:40,00:40:42,"So he said, this isn't going to work at all."
00:40:42,00:40:44,So he just bowed and the curtains closed.
00:40:44,00:40:45,"I mean, yeah."
00:40:45,00:40:49,I just have one more creative thing people are doing to stop traffic violations.
00:40:49,00:40:50,I see.
00:40:50,00:40:54,"So, in Shenzhen, in China, they have a problem with traffic violations."
00:40:54,00:40:57,And they've tried all these creative ways of stopping them.
00:40:57,00:41:01,"So, one of the things is that if you're called J-walking,"
00:41:01,00:41:04,then you're punished by being turned into a traffic warden.
00:41:04,00:41:06,And you have to...
00:41:06,00:41:08,You have to catch the next J-walker.
00:41:08,00:41:10,And they make you wear this like...
00:41:10,00:41:12,That's a brilliant idea.
00:41:12,00:41:13,"It's good, isn't it?"
00:41:13,00:41:14,Great game.
00:41:14,00:41:17,"And you have to wear a green hat, because apparently you're saying you're wearing a green hat in China as offensive."
00:41:17,00:41:19,So you have to wear the slurrastic green.
00:41:19,00:41:21,"Exactly, because it means cuckolded."
00:41:21,00:41:22,So it's offensive.
00:41:22,00:41:23,You weren't so kidding.
00:41:23,00:41:25,Would this be immediately on the spot?
00:41:25,00:41:26,"It's on the spot, yeah."
00:41:26,00:41:29,And you just have to take over the job of the current traffic warden.
00:41:29,00:41:31,"If you're in a rush to get to work, too bad."
00:41:31,00:41:33,You've got to put on your fluorescent green hat.
00:41:33,00:41:35,Do they get your job?
00:41:35,00:41:38,"But another thing they're doing, as well as that,"
00:41:38,00:41:42,is they are stopping people from leaving their lights on high beam.
00:41:42,00:41:44,"When the police see someone with their lights on high beam,"
00:41:44,00:41:47,they pull the car over and they make the person go out of the car
00:41:47,00:41:50,and stand facing their own car with their eyes straight into the high beam light.
00:41:50,00:41:51,What?
00:41:51,00:41:54,And stare at the bright lights with their car for five minutes.
00:41:54,00:41:56,And then they send you blind?
00:41:56,00:41:57,No.
00:41:57,00:41:58,It's just a bit annoying.
00:41:58,00:41:59,No.
00:41:59,00:42:02,"I mean, it would, in the short term, you would have lights in front of your eyes"
00:42:02,00:42:03,when you close your eyes.
00:42:03,00:42:04,Yeah.
00:42:04,00:42:05,But you wouldn't go blind.
00:42:05,00:42:09,It would make you an extremely dangerous driver as soon as you set off again in your car.
00:42:09,00:42:10,That's true.
00:42:10,00:42:12,"It's like, to put it you for drink driving,"
00:42:12,00:42:14,you've got to down this bottom of your skin.
00:42:14,00:42:21,"Okay, that's it."
