00:00:00,00:00:20,"Oh hello and welcome to another episode, and no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast"
00:00:20,00:00:23,coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:00:23,00:00:28,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Huntamari, and Anna"
00:00:28,00:00:32,"Chazinski, and once again we have gathered around the microphones only this time not with"
00:00:32,00:00:36,"our four favorite facts from the last seven days, but with the best four facts sent in by"
00:00:36,00:00:38,you the listener.
00:00:38,00:00:42,"And so in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:42,00:00:45,"Starting with fact number one, and that is you Chazinski."
00:00:45,00:00:50,"Yeah, my fact was tweeted into us by someone called Owen Nelligan, so thanks for this Owen,"
00:00:50,00:00:54,this fact is that the person who invented the lie detector married the first person he
00:00:54,00:00:55,interrogated with it.
00:00:55,00:00:59,"Did he say will you eventually marry me, and she said no, and then it came up as a lie?"
00:00:59,00:01:01,"Well, it's so close to that."
00:01:01,00:01:05,"According to a book about the history of lie detection and polygraphs, he, so this is"
00:01:05,00:01:11,"a guy called John Augustus Larson, and he was using a lie detector to interrogate Margaret"
00:01:11,00:01:16,"Taylor, and it was about a diamond ring that she'd had stolen, and so the result of the"
00:01:16,00:01:21,"interrogation was that her diamond ring was found and returned to her, and she was so grateful"
00:01:21,00:01:26,that she volunteered her services to him to play criminal in other lie detection tests.
00:01:26,00:01:30,"And then after about a year, apparently he had her on the lie detection test, and he said,"
00:01:30,00:01:31,do you love me?
00:01:31,00:01:35,"And she said no, and it came up as a lie, and she said, did you tell me that?"
00:01:35,00:01:36,That's bullshit.
00:01:36,00:01:37,"Yeah, right."
00:01:37,00:01:40,"But no, no, I really don't."
00:01:40,00:01:41,"Oh, well, the machine's saying it."
00:01:41,00:01:42,"Sorry, what?"
00:01:42,00:01:45,"I got something the machine's saying, and I must do it."
00:01:45,00:01:48,Do you take this man to be a lovely wedding husband?
00:01:48,00:01:49,No.
00:01:49,00:01:51,Sorry.
00:01:51,00:01:56,"Because it made news, the fact that they got married, it was headline news at the time."
00:01:56,00:02:01,"The San Francisco Examiner had it on its front page, it said, inventor of lie detector traps"
00:02:01,00:02:04,bride.
00:02:04,00:02:09,"They had their wedding as well with all the police force there, and yeah, and they played,"
00:02:09,00:02:12,"they played a prank on them, basically immediately after the ceremony."
00:02:12,00:02:13,They beat them up.
00:02:13,00:02:18,"Yeah, they handcuffed them, and they packed them into a patty wagon and just abandoned"
00:02:18,00:02:20,"them in a countryside, just left them."
00:02:20,00:02:21,Yeah.
00:02:21,00:02:22,It's a classic police prank.
00:02:22,00:02:23,Yeah.
00:02:23,00:02:25,So I'm a bit confused about him inventing this thing.
00:02:25,00:02:28,John Augustus last at the man who married the woman he interrogated.
00:02:28,00:02:29,Yes.
00:02:29,00:02:32,"So the invention of lie detector involves several stages, I guess."
00:02:32,00:02:37,But what he did was he integrated a test for blood pressure that had already been invented
00:02:37,00:02:42,"by someone called William Masterson, and he integrated that with a way to measure your"
00:02:42,00:02:47,"pulse, your respiration, and your skin conductivity, and put that all together."
00:02:47,00:02:49,And then that was what became called the polygraph.
00:02:49,00:02:52,So there are lots of different people who might have invented it.
00:02:52,00:02:53,Yes.
00:02:53,00:02:57,If only we had a way of telling who was the real one.
00:02:57,00:03:02,"And you say someone called William Masterson, but William Masterson is hugely famous in the"
00:03:02,00:03:05,world of comic books because he is the inventor of Wonder Woman.
00:03:05,00:03:06,"Oh, yeah."
00:03:06,00:03:07,Yeah.
00:03:07,00:03:11,"So the inventor of the lie detector also, well, the inventor of one of the stages of the"
00:03:11,00:03:14,lie detector also created Wonder Woman.
00:03:14,00:03:19,"And it was his wife, Elizabeth, who helped him sort of connect the dots about the idea of"
00:03:19,00:03:24,emotion and blood pressure being combined as a thing that you could tell people's emotions
00:03:24,00:03:25,from.
00:03:25,00:03:26,And that's for truth or false.
00:03:26,00:03:28,How did he trap her?
00:03:28,00:03:33,"With the I assume the lissue, probably, the lissue of truth, because she has a Wonder Woman,"
00:03:33,00:03:34,has a lissue.
00:03:34,00:03:35,Yeah.
00:03:35,00:03:36,And anyone caught in it can't lie.
00:03:36,00:03:37,She has a lie detector.
00:03:37,00:03:38,"Yeah, that's her weapon."
00:03:38,00:03:40,"That's not a lie detector, though, is it?"
00:03:40,00:03:43,"If you can't lie, that's not a lie detector, because every single thing you say will be"
00:03:43,00:03:44,the truth.
00:03:44,00:03:45,"It's just a lie, a inventor."
00:03:45,00:03:46,"Yeah, that's true."
00:03:46,00:03:48,It's just very quickly on William Marsden.
00:03:48,00:03:52,"He had a really odd relationship, because they're not sure who Wonder Woman was properly based"
00:03:52,00:03:53,on.
00:03:53,00:03:56,"They think that it was his wife, Elizabeth, but also they think it was this other lady"
00:03:56,00:03:57,called Olive.
00:03:57,00:04:02,"Turns out that they had an open relationship, and they're based on both, so just a little"
00:04:02,00:04:03,nugget there.
00:04:03,00:04:04,"He lived with both women, didn't he?"
00:04:04,00:04:05,"Yeah, he did, yeah."
00:04:05,00:04:08,Which of those two was the one who wore the weird outfit?
00:04:08,00:04:10,"One of them wore the outfit, but the other one had a golden lissue."
00:04:10,00:04:11,Yeah.
00:04:11,00:04:13,He wasn't a very creative man at all.
00:04:13,00:04:15,"He was a bit of a self-promote, wasn't he?"
00:04:15,00:04:18,I think that's why we associate him with the polygraph these days.
00:04:18,00:04:23,"So there was a Gillette advert in 1938, which he appeared on, to say that the company's"
00:04:23,00:04:26,"raises were better than the competition, but he's using the polygraph."
00:04:26,00:04:29,"Yeah, he sort of hooked people up to it."
00:04:29,00:04:31,Which race is best?
00:04:31,00:04:33,Is it Gillette a Wilkinson sword?
00:04:33,00:04:36,"And presumably if they said Wilkinson sword, it can cut it."
00:04:36,00:04:38,"Yeah, as polygraphs don't actually work, do they?"
00:04:38,00:04:40,"No, they don't think it's amazing."
00:04:40,00:04:41,These things are complete crops.
00:04:41,00:04:43,"So they don't work, but they're still used or are they not used anymore?"
00:04:43,00:04:44,They're used.
00:04:44,00:04:45,But am I right?
00:04:45,00:04:48,"I'm saying in court, they don't necessarily take them as solid evidence."
00:04:48,00:04:49,They do.
00:04:49,00:04:50,"They do, and Jeremy Kyle though."
00:04:50,00:04:51,Right.
00:04:51,00:04:53,But they're used in lots of other processes.
00:04:53,00:04:57,So there was an article this week about how Trump's having real problems with getting
00:04:57,00:04:58,a border control force up.
00:04:58,00:05:01,So he wanted to increase the US border control by thousands.
00:05:01,00:05:05,"And actually, their numbers are decreasing at the moment in the US border control."
00:05:05,00:05:08,And one of the reasons for that is that two thirds of them fail the lie detector test
00:05:08,00:05:11,that you have to pass to get into US border control.
00:05:11,00:05:12,I didn't know you'd do.
00:05:12,00:05:14,Do you need to pass one to become president?
00:05:14,00:05:17,I do not believe so.
00:05:17,00:05:23,"But so if you are a particularly guilty person, just in general, you might fail a lie detector test"
00:05:23,00:05:28,"just because you think of what would happen if you had told a lie, or if you had committed"
00:05:28,00:05:33,"the crime that they're asking you about, so that will cause you a spike in blood pressure"
00:05:33,00:05:36,or a spike in temperature or a spike in your heart rate or whatever.
00:05:36,00:05:39,"And also, you can normalize the responses."
00:05:39,00:05:43,"So if they are asking you control questions at the beginning, and you let's say you bite"
00:05:43,00:05:49,"your tongue or you stab the inside of your leg with a fork or whatever while that's happening,"
00:05:49,00:05:50,then that will cause a big spike.
00:05:50,00:05:53,"And I think, well, those spikes are normal when he's answering those control questions."
00:05:53,00:05:56,"So later on, when we're asking him about the murder, you might have the same spike and"
00:05:56,00:05:57,"they'll say, well, no, you didn't do it."
00:05:57,00:06:01,Do you think they'll be suspicious because you bring a fork into the polygrip test?
00:06:01,00:06:02,Right.
00:06:02,00:06:03,"Yeah, they might."
00:06:03,00:06:06,They might be leading out of your mouth for all that gun biting.
00:06:06,00:06:12,"Mr. Murray, is it true that you stole all the fox from the cartoon?"
00:06:12,00:06:13,Yeah.
00:06:13,00:06:19,"So on the guy that this fact is about, he solved the crime that he was put in charge of solving."
00:06:19,00:06:24,So it was his mystery on the campus of the University of California over who was stealing
00:06:24,00:06:25,lots of the students' possessions.
00:06:25,00:06:28,"So Margaret Taylor, who he married, had a diamond ring stolen."
00:06:28,00:06:33,And he figured out who it was because he did a lie detector test on all of these students.
00:06:33,00:06:34,And this is how it worked.
00:06:34,00:06:38,"He ended up working, apparently, to prove that the lie detector test would work forever more."
00:06:38,00:06:42,The way it worked was he sat to someone down who was called Helen Graham and asked her if
00:06:42,00:06:44,she'd taken the money.
00:06:44,00:06:48,She exploded with rage to all of her equipment off around over to the recording device to
00:06:48,00:06:52,tear it up and said it was outrageous that anyone was allowed to use that.
00:06:52,00:06:55,She had to be restrained and said that otherwise she would have beaten the officer in the face.
00:06:55,00:06:59,So it sounds like she did it.
00:06:59,00:07:04,And she did it and then admit later on to doing the crime.
00:07:04,00:07:05,So that's how they work.
00:07:05,00:07:08,They just send you flying into a rage.
00:07:08,00:07:09,"I think that is how they work, isn't it?"
00:07:09,00:07:16,"Like, really, the only way that a polygraph could possibly work in a court of law is by making"
00:07:16,00:07:18,"you admit to something, right?"
00:07:18,00:07:19,Because people think they work.
00:07:19,00:07:20,Yeah.
00:07:20,00:07:21,Yeah.
00:07:21,00:07:22,So they then become truthful.
00:07:22,00:07:23,So there was.
00:07:23,00:07:29,This was supposedly a method they used in BC era to determine whether someone was lying
00:07:29,00:07:30,or not.
00:07:30,00:07:31,"Supposedly in India, this was used."
00:07:31,00:07:35,"What you would do is you get a donkey and you'd cover its tail in soot, right?"
00:07:35,00:07:38,"And then you put the donkey in a tent, okay?"
00:07:38,00:07:41,And this is a dark tent and it's that night that you do this.
00:07:41,00:07:45,"And then you put the suspected liar in there and you say, ""We've got a magic donkey."""
00:07:45,00:07:50,And you have to grab the tail of the donkey when you're in there.
00:07:50,00:07:53,"And if it braze, we'll know that you committed the crime."
00:07:53,00:07:56,"But actually, what it is is, if they come out and they haven't got subtle over their"
00:07:56,00:08:01,"hands, then you know that they didn't even grab the donkey's tail in the first place."
00:08:01,00:08:03,So that's how they tell that you're the wrong one.
00:08:03,00:08:08,"There's a story that Charles Napier did that, who's won the Inventors of Logarithms, but"
00:08:08,00:08:10,he did it with a chicken.
00:08:10,00:08:14,"So he had his dark room, he put soot on his cock, and then asked people, ""Andy."""
00:08:14,00:08:22,"I knew you were going to say it, but I'm so pleased with it when you did."
00:08:22,00:08:26,"No, he put, he did a dark room, put soot on his chicken and then told people it was a magic"
00:08:26,00:08:27,chicken.
00:08:27,00:08:31,"And again, it was the people without sutted hands who he knew were guilty."
00:08:31,00:08:34,"Yeah, but actually, even if I was innocent, I wouldn't take the risk of the chicken actually"
00:08:34,00:08:36,being magic and wrong.
00:08:36,00:08:39,Could you do this?
00:08:39,00:08:43,It could be a magic chicken who's just got it in for you.
00:08:43,00:08:44,"Yeah, exactly."
00:08:44,00:08:46,That chicken's always hated me.
00:08:46,00:08:51,"Because you do assume that if you pull a donkey's tail, it probably will braze."
00:08:51,00:08:57,"I think even in the illogical days of the BC era, people knew that they might do that, even"
00:08:57,00:08:59,if they haven't committed the crime.
00:08:59,00:09:03,"Or we went to say for the BC era, what's the correct way of saying it?"
00:09:03,00:09:04,I think that's it.
00:09:04,00:09:05,"Oh, I think that's it."
00:09:05,00:09:06,Before the time of Christ?
00:09:06,00:09:07,Yeah.
00:09:07,00:09:09,"Before the common era, I think."
00:09:09,00:09:10,Yeah.
00:09:10,00:09:11,What's the E when the BCE?
00:09:11,00:09:12,Era.
00:09:12,00:09:13,James said it.
00:09:13,00:09:14,It's actually…
00:09:14,00:09:15,Just said it naturally.
00:09:15,00:09:16,Wow.
00:09:16,00:09:18,But we could switch those two sentences right.
00:09:18,00:09:19,Yeah.
00:09:19,00:09:22,Do you want to know another method of telling the truth?
00:09:22,00:09:23,"Yes, please."
00:09:23,00:09:24,Which era is it from?
00:09:24,00:09:26,This is from the AD era.
00:09:26,00:09:28,The anal domini era.
00:09:28,00:09:29,Exactly.
00:09:29,00:09:30,Yeah.
00:09:30,00:09:34,What does AD stand for?
00:09:34,00:09:41,"So this is in China, when you're being prosecuted, you have to hold a mouthful of rice during"
00:09:41,00:09:42,the prosecutor's speech.
00:09:42,00:09:46,"Now, it was believed that when people are anxious, they stop salivating."
00:09:46,00:09:50,And you know that feeling of having a dry mouth when you're nervous.
00:09:50,00:09:56,"So if the rice was dry by the time the prosecutor finished speaking, it was believed that you were"
00:09:56,00:10:00,guilty because you hadn't been salivating and the prosecutor's talking about your crime.
00:10:00,00:10:01,Which is unbelievable.
00:10:01,00:10:05,"Because actually, it could have just taken lots of ecstasy, for instance."
00:10:05,00:10:06,"Yeah, that was true."
00:10:06,00:10:08,Does that give you a dry mouth?
00:10:08,00:10:09,"Yeah, I've heard."
00:10:09,00:10:10,Yeah.
00:10:10,00:10:18,Do you know who invented the first way of measuring your pulse?
00:10:18,00:10:21,"Oh, that must be a before-common era thing, isn't it?"
00:10:21,00:10:22,It's not.
00:10:22,00:10:27,"So actually, maybe it's the first way that this book I was reading claimed."
00:10:27,00:10:28,"So it was Galileo, apparently."
00:10:28,00:10:29,But it's really clever.
00:10:29,00:10:33,"So at the time, people didn't have watches where you could, you know, obviously check someone's"
00:10:33,00:10:35,pulse against the ticking of your watch.
00:10:35,00:10:36,You took a checker by the sun dial.
00:10:36,00:10:41,In the scene of hours.
00:10:41,00:10:42,Full day.
00:10:42,00:10:45,So he invented this thing called the pulsillodium.
00:10:45,00:10:48,And what he did was he rigged up this pendulum.
00:10:48,00:10:53,So he hung this pendulum up and then he got the pendulum going and it was attached to a thread.
00:10:53,00:10:57,So it was swinging and attached to this thread that he could pull on to make it longer or shorter.
00:10:57,00:11:01,And he'd have the pendulum in one hand with his hand on that thread.
00:11:01,00:11:04,And then he'd test someone's pulse with the other hand.
00:11:04,00:11:08,And he'd make the string longer or shorter until it was exactly in time with that person's
00:11:08,00:11:09,pulse.
00:11:09,00:11:13,And that's a really accurate way of measuring it because the length of the pendulum tells
00:11:13,00:11:16,"you how fast their pulse is going and then you know if that's normal, isn't that really"
00:11:16,00:11:17,clever?
00:11:17,00:11:18,That is really cool.
00:11:18,00:11:19,That is.
00:11:19,00:11:20,"He was pretty clever, wasn't he?"
00:11:20,00:11:21,He was OK.
00:11:21,00:11:22,Yeah.
00:11:22,00:11:25,"There is a method where, so this is a test they tried in the 1980s."
00:11:25,00:11:28,"Basically, there were loads of different lie detector tests and would they hope that they're"
00:11:28,00:11:31,going to get a really accurate one at some point?
00:11:31,00:11:36,"There's a test called P300 which is basically that after you see a very distinct image,"
00:11:36,00:11:41,"your brain will have a little burst of activity at 300 milliseconds after you see it, right?"
00:11:41,00:11:42,Right.
00:11:42,00:11:48,"So the idea was if someone had committed a crime, let's say I mugged someone who was wearing"
00:11:48,00:11:54,"an orange suit and I saw that suit again later, my brain would register that same burst"
00:11:54,00:11:55,of activity.
00:11:55,00:11:56,But then an orange suit is quite unusual.
00:11:56,00:12:00,"So I think if I saw an orange suit, I would also be, this is the problem."
00:12:00,00:12:04,And you have to find things that the criminal saw and that are unique.
00:12:04,00:12:09,"So maybe he works in an orange suit, a factory and he won't register the same thing."
00:12:09,00:12:13,"And actually criminals wear orange boiler suits, don't they?"
00:12:13,00:12:14,Yeah.
00:12:14,00:12:15,That's true.
00:12:15,00:12:17,So he might just be worried about the prospect of getting to prison for a crime he didn't
00:12:17,00:12:18,commit.
00:12:18,00:12:19,"So that did not work, basically."
00:12:19,00:12:20,Yeah.
00:12:20,00:12:23,"So it's the logic there that if you know that that test happening, if you commit a crime,"
00:12:23,00:12:25,you should do it in a place with no distinguishing features.
00:12:25,00:12:34,Like Slough.
00:12:34,00:12:39,"OK, it is time for fact number two and that is Andy."
00:12:39,00:12:46,My fact is that Lichtenstein has roughly two companies for every person who lives there.
00:12:46,00:12:50,So this is a fact from a guy called Richard Smith at Richard AV Smith.
00:12:50,00:12:53,"So probably we're not saying that these people all own two companies, are we?"
00:12:53,00:12:54,"No, we're not."
00:12:54,00:13:00,"Other companies are from overseas, but they're registered in Lichtenstein because it's a tax"
00:13:00,00:13:01,haven.
00:13:01,00:13:05,They make all their money from extremely dubious financial arrangements.
00:13:05,00:13:08,"They don't make all their money, or indeed any of their money from dubious arrangements,"
00:13:08,00:13:09,I'm sure.
00:13:09,00:13:12,Just in case the lies are listening.
00:13:12,00:13:15,I'm sure they make a lot of their money from practices that are frowned on in the wider
00:13:15,00:13:20,"international community, but which happen to be legal in Lichtenstein."
00:13:20,00:13:23,"But they make money and false teeth, don't they?"
00:13:23,00:13:28,"I remember there's an old cue, I fact, that they're the biggest exporters of false teeth in"
00:13:28,00:13:29,the world in Lichtenstein.
00:13:29,00:13:34,"I think China might be about to overtake them, but Lichtenstein has been punching above"
00:13:34,00:13:35,his weight for some time.
00:13:35,00:13:41,"Yeah, they've got 35,000 people, it's amazing that they export more than China."
00:13:41,00:13:43,How many of the companies are false teeth?
00:13:43,00:13:47,"Almost all of them, but yeah, there's very little tax havens stuff going on."
00:13:47,00:13:52,"Are we talking teeth with gums, like as in full sets of dentures?"
00:13:52,00:13:53,Dentures.
00:13:53,00:13:54,So not individual teeth.
00:13:54,00:13:57,"Well, I guess it depends, doesn't it?"
00:13:57,00:13:58,I think it's dentures.
00:13:58,00:14:00,I think it's one company that makes all these dentures.
00:14:00,00:14:01,Right.
00:14:01,00:14:02,I think it's in Lichtenstein.
00:14:02,00:14:03,"It's a funny old place, isn't it?"
00:14:03,00:14:04,It's an amazing little place.
00:14:04,00:14:05,Yeah.
00:14:05,00:14:08,"I mean, it's named after the guy who bought it."
00:14:08,00:14:10,That's pretty amazing.
00:14:10,00:14:15,And the family who still are the royalty there are the descendants of him.
00:14:15,00:14:16,So it's still the Lichtenstein family.
00:14:16,00:14:19,You just never see that because they never use their surname.
00:14:19,00:14:20,So weird.
00:14:20,00:14:21,"It's like Queen Elizabeth, you know."
00:14:21,00:14:22,You rarely see Windsor.
00:14:22,00:14:23,She's called England.
00:14:23,00:14:24,"Oh, she not called England."
00:14:24,00:14:30,"So it's 160 square kilometers, which is 74th the size of Yorkshire."
00:14:30,00:14:31,Wow.
00:14:31,00:14:32,Wow.
00:14:32,00:14:33,"I mean, I don't know how big Yorkshire is."
00:14:33,00:14:34,It's quite big.
00:14:34,00:14:37,"Yorkshire is quite big, but it's smaller than like England, for instance."
00:14:37,00:14:38,Yeah.
00:14:38,00:14:39,Yeah.
00:14:39,00:14:44,"I read a really good fact in Lonely Planet about Lichtenstein, which is that their last"
00:14:44,00:14:48,military engagement was in 1866.
00:14:48,00:14:51,The last time they sent soldiers out.
00:14:51,00:14:57,So 80 soldiers went out and 81 returned.
00:14:57,00:15:00,They made a friend and brought one back.
00:15:00,00:15:03,"Well, what is a friend other than someone that you've captured?"
00:15:03,00:15:07,"Well, he knows an Italian guy who's just like, I love you guys."
00:15:07,00:15:08,You're really fun.
00:15:08,00:15:09,I'll come back to Lichtenstein.
00:15:09,00:15:13,That sounds like Stockholm Syndrome to me.
00:15:13,00:15:21,"In 2007, 170 Swiss troops marched into Lichtenstein by accident on a training exercise."
00:15:21,00:15:22,They crossed the border.
00:15:22,00:15:26,"So basically, it's their army going into another country, which could be kind of a bad"
00:15:26,00:15:27,"thing, I guess."
00:15:27,00:15:32,But the truth is that Lichtenstein's defence is actually looked after by Switzerland.
00:15:32,00:15:36,Lichtenstein doesn't really have an army of its own.
00:15:36,00:15:40,That's such a confusing defence attack strategy that's going through your head.
00:15:40,00:15:41,So you could march in.
00:15:41,00:15:47,"And then if anyone stops you, stop hitting yourself."
00:15:47,00:15:50,"They've done it a few times, actually."
00:15:50,00:15:53,"They threw grenades into Lichtenstein, I think, in the late '60s."
00:15:53,00:15:54,Really?
00:15:54,00:15:58,"And another time they set a bit on fire with flame throwers, they started a forest fire."
00:15:58,00:16:01,"They did ring to apologise after the 2007 one, didn't they?"
00:16:01,00:16:02,I think they went in.
00:16:02,00:16:04,Lichtenstein didn't notice.
00:16:04,00:16:06,They ran away again quickly after they realised.
00:16:06,00:16:09,"And then they called the next day to say, I'm really sorry, we accidentally invaded"
00:16:09,00:16:10,you.
00:16:10,00:16:13,"And then the Minister of the Interior said, it's no problem at all, these things happen."
00:16:13,00:16:20,"So that happened again in 2002 when British Marines invaded Spain by mistake, thinking that"
00:16:20,00:16:22,they were practising and invading Gibraltar.
00:16:22,00:16:26,"Despite the fact that Gibraltar has a massive rock sticking out of it, and they said, well,"
00:16:26,00:16:28,"the beach is very confusing, actually."
00:16:28,00:16:29,So they stormed us off.
00:16:29,00:16:31,"They had assault rifles, they had mortars."
00:16:31,00:16:34,"They took up a defensive position, just to face a couple of Spanish fishermen and a"
00:16:34,00:16:39,"couple of local policemen who said, Gibraltar's over there, look."
00:16:39,00:16:43,"And the MOD later on said, it was clearly an embarrassing and unfortunate incident."
00:16:43,00:16:46,They made their apologies and left.
00:16:46,00:16:51,"But when they said Gibraltar's over there, does that mean the army asked for directions?"
00:16:51,00:16:52,"No, I don't think they did."
00:16:52,00:16:53,Right.
00:16:53,00:16:56,I think the Spanish police must have known that they were doing a training exercise.
00:16:56,00:16:57,"Oh, yes."
00:16:57,00:16:58,Yeah.
00:16:58,00:16:59,Rather than assuming they were being invaded by British.
00:16:59,00:17:00,Yeah.
00:17:00,00:17:03,Although apologising and leaving is a very British way to invade somewhere.
00:17:03,00:17:04,Yeah.
00:17:04,00:17:05,Sorry.
00:17:05,00:17:10,"The ruler, Prince of Lixianstein, is the wealthiest monarch in Europe."
00:17:10,00:17:11,Wow.
00:17:11,00:17:13,"He's in the billions, isn't he?"
00:17:13,00:17:15,"He's five billion, I think, because of all the--"
00:17:15,00:17:16,They're both of the billions.
00:17:16,00:17:17,Yeah.
00:17:17,00:17:22,"Well, because the crown wealth doesn't actually count towards the queen's personal wealth"
00:17:22,00:17:23,officially.
00:17:23,00:17:26,"Otherwise, obviously, she'd be well up there."
00:17:26,00:17:27,Yeah.
00:17:27,00:17:28,"But yeah, he's loaded."
00:17:28,00:17:29,But people love him.
00:17:29,00:17:35,"So in July 2012, Lixianstein did a bit of a turkey, and they-- there was a referendum"
00:17:35,00:17:36,on the trip.
00:17:36,00:17:38,I think we can call it that.
00:17:38,00:17:42,There was a referendum on whether the Prince should have all of his powers extended and whether
00:17:42,00:17:45,he should have the power to veto the results of any future referendum.
00:17:45,00:17:48,"And 76% of the country said, yes."
00:17:48,00:17:49,Yeah.
00:17:49,00:17:53,"We think if there are ever referendum in future, you should be allowed to overall them immediately."
00:17:53,00:17:55,So they love the guy.
00:17:55,00:17:56,Yeah.
00:17:56,00:17:57,They do.
00:17:57,00:18:00,"And he-- he's an interesting character, because during that period, he threatened to just"
00:18:00,00:18:01,leave.
00:18:01,00:18:03,I think that was why they voted.
00:18:03,00:18:04,I think that was why they voted.
00:18:04,00:18:05,Yeah.
00:18:05,00:18:06,I'm just going to leave.
00:18:06,00:18:07,I'm going to take all my money.
00:18:07,00:18:10,"I'm going to take the name of the country that is me, because I think of a new name."
00:18:10,00:18:13,I'm taking back that Italian who came back with the army.
00:18:13,00:18:14,I'm taking everything.
00:18:14,00:18:18,And he-- because they had another referendum where they wanted to talk about abortion and
00:18:18,00:18:22,"whether it should be legal, because there's a legal in Lixianstein, and they said we want"
00:18:22,00:18:23,it legal.
00:18:23,00:18:25,"And he just went, no, sorry."
00:18:25,00:18:26,I'm overruling that.
00:18:26,00:18:27,It's not happening.
00:18:27,00:18:32,He once a year throws a big party for everyone in Lixianstein to come to his-- the
00:18:32,00:18:33,palaces.
00:18:33,00:18:37,"Actually, 20 odd percent of those wanted him to leave the country."
00:18:37,00:18:38,Yes.
00:18:38,00:18:40,The people invited to this party.
00:18:40,00:18:42,We'll put them over near the toilet.
00:18:42,00:18:43,Yeah.
00:18:43,00:18:45,It doesn't all grudges like that.
00:18:45,00:18:49,"36,000 people invited to the same party, and it's supposed to be a garden party on his"
00:18:49,00:18:50,lawn.
00:18:50,00:18:51,So I just want to know how big his lawn is.
00:18:51,00:18:55,"I guess if you own Lixianstein, the whole thing is your garden, so it's just like that's"
00:18:55,00:18:56,the party.
00:18:56,00:18:57,That's where you are.
00:18:57,00:18:58,So just stay at home.
00:18:58,00:18:59,Yeah.
00:18:59,00:19:00,"Well, how do you not attend the party?"
00:19:00,00:19:01,If you're annoyed about the referendum.
00:19:01,00:19:04,That's why everyone attends the party to leave the country.
00:19:04,00:19:06,"30,000 isn't that many though, is it?"
00:19:06,00:19:11,"If you think about a football game, like Man United Game would have what, 70,000 or something."
00:19:11,00:19:12,I guess.
00:19:12,00:19:13,It's quite a lot.
00:19:13,00:19:14,I'm thinking of my flat now.
00:19:14,00:19:17,So I think his garden's probably bigger than your flat.
00:19:17,00:19:18,But not by much.
00:19:18,00:19:19,I know what you're saying.
00:19:19,00:19:20,Yeah.
00:19:20,00:19:21,I've never been to your flat.
00:19:21,00:19:22,No.
00:19:22,00:19:23,"Oh, sorry, yeah."
00:19:23,00:19:24,We had a party.
00:19:24,00:19:35,I'm afraid not the whole population of the podcast is invited.
00:19:35,00:19:38,"OK, it is time for fact number three."
00:19:38,00:19:39,And that is by fact.
00:19:39,00:19:42,My fact was sent in by Luke Haynes.
00:19:42,00:19:43,That was on email.
00:19:43,00:19:51,"In 47 BC, there was a giant robot, Cleopatra, walking the streets of Alexandria, squirting milk"
00:19:51,00:19:54,from her breasts onto the heads of onlookers.
00:19:54,00:19:55,OK.
00:19:55,00:19:56,Yes.
00:19:56,00:19:57,This was sent to you personally.
00:19:57,00:19:58,Was it that one?
00:19:58,00:19:59,This was sent to all of us.
00:19:59,00:20:02,But I think it was edged towards me in the email.
00:20:02,00:20:04,Do you stand by it?
00:20:04,00:20:07,"Well, I did when I read it and sent it to you and let you go research it."
00:20:07,00:20:11,"And now having Googled it, I can't find any evidence that it's real."
00:20:11,00:20:14,It appears in a new statesman article.
00:20:14,00:20:18,"And it's delivered at the top of the piece, very confidently, as if it's fact."
00:20:18,00:20:20,And I just can't seem to find it anywhere else.
00:20:20,00:20:23,But I still stand by it.
00:20:23,00:20:24,OK.
00:20:24,00:20:27,So I read a review of a book called Cleopatra Alive by Stacey Schiff.
00:20:27,00:20:28,Yes.
00:20:28,00:20:33,"The review was by Mary Beard, who I think we do trust, as a classist."
00:20:33,00:20:39,And she wrote about a famous procession in honor of the god Dionysus in the third century
00:20:39,00:20:43,BC by Ptolemy II.
00:20:43,00:20:45,So that's before Cleopatra.
00:20:45,00:20:49,"And they wrote that there were floats, and one of the floats had a large statue which"
00:20:49,00:20:54,stood up mechanically without anyone laying a hand on it and sat back down again when it
00:20:54,00:20:56,had poured a libation of milk.
00:20:56,00:20:58,"Oh, wow."
00:20:58,00:21:03,"So I don't know if this is the same thing, or even if that's true, but I, you know, that"
00:21:03,00:21:04,is from a good source.
00:21:04,00:21:05,Yep.
00:21:05,00:21:07,But it seems to me like maybe two things have been conflated.
00:21:07,00:21:08,"I don't know, though."
00:21:08,00:21:10,Was it a statue of Cleopatra?
00:21:10,00:21:12,Because that would be truly extraordinary before she was born?
00:21:12,00:21:13,300 years before she was born.
00:21:13,00:21:14,Yeah.
00:21:14,00:21:16,"Well, it might not have been before the first Cleopatra, because Cleopatra was actually"
00:21:16,00:21:19,Cleopatra VII.
00:21:19,00:21:20,Yes.
00:21:20,00:21:24,"So one who is famous, you know, for having affairs with Julius Caesar in marketing and things"
00:21:24,00:21:25,like that.
00:21:25,00:21:26,She was the seventh.
00:21:26,00:21:28,You know how she hooked up with Caesar?
00:21:28,00:21:29,Chop.
00:21:29,00:21:30,Tinder.
00:21:30,00:21:31,Yeah.
00:21:31,00:21:36,"It was, it was like their version of Tinder, and this is how it worked."
00:21:36,00:21:41,"She was married at the time to her brother, as was customary, so she actually married both"
00:21:41,00:21:45,"of her brothers, both called Ptolemy, and she engineered the death of both of them as"
00:21:45,00:21:46,well.
00:21:46,00:21:47,Yeah.
00:21:47,00:21:51,"No, so she decided that she wanted to hang out with Caesar, because he was a very powerful"
00:21:51,00:21:52,man.
00:21:52,00:21:55,"I wanted to have a bit of flirting with him, and she was having a feud with her husband and"
00:21:55,00:21:56,see Ptolemy.
00:21:56,00:21:57,And Caesar was Ptolemy's enemy.
00:21:57,00:21:59,"Sorry, which Ptolemy we're talking about."
00:21:59,00:22:02,"We're talking about Ptolemy her brother, or Ptolemy her brother brother."
00:22:02,00:22:05,"She really had a type, didn't she?"
00:22:05,00:22:07,"She's feeling in the profile of the dating aid, didn't she?"
00:22:07,00:22:11,"Must be six foot, called Ptolemy, my brother."
00:22:11,00:22:19,"Yeah, it was Ptolemy her brother, which one?"
00:22:19,00:22:22,"Her brother, her brother, her brother."
00:22:22,00:22:26,"Anyway, he said, you obviously can't see Caesar, because he's my enemy, and so she had"
00:22:26,00:22:31,"herself wrapped up in a carpet and smuggled into Caesar's personal quarters, and then I think"
00:22:31,00:22:32,this is a famous depiction of her.
00:22:32,00:22:35,"She's always unrolled in films of Cleopatra, isn't she?"
00:22:35,00:22:36,Yeah.
00:22:36,00:22:37,I love it.
00:22:37,00:22:38,It's so fun.
00:22:38,00:22:39,The idea of being unrolled from a carpet onto the floor.
00:22:39,00:22:42,"You know what, it sounds like fun, but I reckon when you do it, it's not going to be much"
00:22:42,00:22:43,fun.
00:22:43,00:22:47,"Because the carpet will be round by the end of the rolling process, but as it gets closer"
00:22:47,00:22:50,"and closer towards your body as you're being unrolled, obviously the carpet will be more"
00:22:50,00:22:53,"in your shape, and you'll be sort of bumping over the floor."
00:22:53,00:22:55,"You're going to be bumping, it's going to be."
00:22:55,00:22:56,Yeah.
00:22:56,00:22:59,"That's if you haven't suffocated in the carpet, maybe there's a delay, you know?"
00:22:59,00:23:03,"That would have been a sudden anticlimax, which is a dead clear pattern."
00:23:03,00:23:04,Rolls out.
00:23:04,00:23:05,Roll the back up.
00:23:05,00:23:06,Take her out.
00:23:06,00:23:11,Wouldn't they furotously imbred then if they were all marrying their siblings?
00:23:11,00:23:12,Yes.
00:23:12,00:23:13,But she wasn't having babies with them.
00:23:13,00:23:14,No.
00:23:14,00:23:15,It was all about keeping power.
00:23:15,00:23:16,That would be disgusting.
00:23:16,00:23:17,Right.
00:23:17,00:23:18,Yeah.
00:23:18,00:23:19,It was all about keeping power.
00:23:19,00:23:21,"So she married one of the tolamies when he was ten, and that was so that he could be the"
00:23:21,00:23:22,co-ruler.
00:23:22,00:23:23,"Ah, okay."
00:23:23,00:23:27,"But the thing is, I don't think they were particularly against having sex with each other."
00:23:27,00:23:28,I loved it.
00:23:28,00:23:29,You know?
00:23:29,00:23:30,I loved it.
00:23:30,00:23:34,Cleopatra had only six great-great-grandparents out of a possible 16.
00:23:34,00:23:36,Wow.
00:23:36,00:23:37,Wow.
00:23:37,00:23:38,Wow.
00:23:38,00:23:41,"But on the plus side, she had a lot of extra toes."
00:23:41,00:23:44,Is that a plus?
00:23:44,00:23:46,"I'm toes on that use, but I feel like I've just got enough."
00:23:46,00:23:52,"It would make the game of this little piggy goes to market, go on a long time, but that's true."
00:23:52,00:23:54,"Just on this little piggy, married as brother."
00:23:54,00:23:57,It was also called tolamy.
00:23:57,00:24:01,Tolamy.
00:24:01,00:24:07,"Speaking of toes, found out a thing a while ago, ancient Egypt."
00:24:07,00:24:10,This is sort of going into robots.
00:24:10,00:24:15,"Ancient Egypt, they actually worked out how to make a strap-on toe for people who'd lost"
00:24:15,00:24:19,a toe so that it worked so that they could continue to walk like an Egyptian.
00:24:19,00:24:21,That's a terrible joke.
00:24:21,00:24:23,That's a terrible joke.
00:24:23,00:24:24,No.
00:24:24,00:24:25,So it's amazing.
00:24:25,00:24:26,They found it.
00:24:26,00:24:29,It's the oldest use of augmenting a human prosthetic where they were able to walk
00:24:29,00:24:32,"something, and they found it, because it's a leather and wooden thing that they would strap"
00:24:32,00:24:34,onto the toe.
00:24:34,00:24:39,"The flexibility of it was up to 86%, which meant that it literally worked like how a normal"
00:24:39,00:24:40,toe would function.
00:24:40,00:24:41,It wasn't.
00:24:41,00:24:44,"That was like, they must have had prototype models and refined it and refined it."
00:24:44,00:24:48,So the flexibility allowed them perfect gate for what they had before.
00:24:48,00:24:49,Really?
00:24:49,00:24:52,It was a specific rule in American football that you're not allowed to kick the ball with
00:24:52,00:24:54,an artificial toe.
00:24:54,00:24:55,Really?
00:24:55,00:24:56,Yeah.
00:24:56,00:24:57,Why?
00:24:57,00:24:58,Because it's spring loaded or something?
00:24:58,00:25:03,"Well, basically, they all, pretty much all the rules in American football, because people"
00:25:03,00:25:06,have done something and then they have to make a rule against it.
00:25:06,00:25:10,"But one of the best kickers of all time, I think he just got his record beaten for the longest"
00:25:10,00:25:17,"ever kick, didn't have any toes on one of his feet, and he had a special fake toe made"
00:25:17,00:25:19,so that he could kick properly.
00:25:19,00:25:22,And it shouldn't really have helped him in any way if you look at it.
00:25:22,00:25:26,"It shouldn't have helped, but obviously his opponents didn't like the idea, and so they"
00:25:26,00:25:27,banned it.
00:25:27,00:25:28,That was really messy.
00:25:28,00:25:29,"Yeah, that's a shame."
00:25:29,00:25:30,Was it that?
00:25:30,00:25:31,Yeah.
00:25:31,00:25:36,"Can I just say, this prosthetic toe dates back between the time of 950 and 710 BC."
00:25:36,00:25:37,Wow.
00:25:37,00:25:38,It's really old.
00:25:38,00:25:39,Yeah.
00:25:39,00:25:40,It's really advanced technology.
00:25:40,00:25:43,I have another thing from around 950 BC.
00:25:43,00:25:44,"Oh, yeah."
00:25:44,00:25:50,"Okay, so this is an automaton by King Mu of Zhu in China."
00:25:50,00:25:53,"I've probably pronounced that wrong, but that's how it looks."
00:25:53,00:26:00,"He had an engineer called Yanxi, and Yanxi gave him a human-shaped figure, which walked"
00:26:00,00:26:05,"with rapid strides, moved its head up and down, and touched its chin, and began singing"
00:26:05,00:26:06,in tune.
00:26:06,00:26:14,"Okay, this was supposedly 950 BC, and the King obviously thought it was amazing, but then"
00:26:14,00:26:19,"as the performance was drawing to an end, the robot winked its eye and made advances to"
00:26:19,00:26:20,the ladies of the audience.
00:26:20,00:26:22,"Oh, no."
00:26:22,00:26:27,And so the King demanded that it be broken down until it was proved that it was actually
00:26:27,00:26:29,"an automaton, because he thought it was some kind of a live thing."
00:26:29,00:26:30,"Also, who was an automaton?"
00:26:30,00:26:34,And I assume the climax was going to be that that was obviously just a sleazy man.
00:26:34,00:26:38,Just painted himself silver.
00:26:38,00:26:39,Yeah.
00:26:39,00:26:43,"Well, I mean, it's a story from ancient China, so maybe it's not even true."
00:26:43,00:26:44,The BC era.
00:26:44,00:26:52,"Yeah, they did have amazing things in the 18th century, so these are automaton, which"
00:26:52,00:26:54,so the recorded we have drawings of them and things like that.
00:26:54,00:27:00,So there was one called the Volcancon duck built by a Frenchman called Jacques de Volcancon
00:27:00,00:27:02,in 1738.
00:27:02,00:27:07,"It could stretch his wings, it could smooth his feathers, it could splash around in water,"
00:27:07,00:27:12,"it could stretch out and take corn from your hand, and then it produced realistic, horrible"
00:27:12,00:27:14,smelling duck droppings.
00:27:14,00:27:15,Wow.
00:27:15,00:27:16,And this was an automaton.
00:27:16,00:27:17,It was unbelievable.
00:27:17,00:27:22,"And sometimes, when he was making a performing front of ladies, de Volcancon would put it in"
00:27:22,00:27:23,a little skirt.
00:27:23,00:27:25,I'm not sure why.
00:27:25,00:27:26,Yeah.
00:27:26,00:27:29,That's what was the purpose that it served?
00:27:29,00:27:30,Was it useful?
00:27:30,00:27:31,"No, entertainment."
00:27:31,00:27:33,It just provided you with duck droppings.
00:27:33,00:27:34,Yeah.
00:27:34,00:27:36,But that's all ducks do to be fair.
00:27:36,00:27:37,Well.
00:27:37,00:27:38,And more ducks.
00:27:38,00:27:39,You can eat them.
00:27:39,00:27:40,That's true.
00:27:40,00:27:45,"Like, if you have one of the greatest engineers in France coming to you with his new invention,"
00:27:45,00:27:49,then all it is is a bit of metal that produces duck droppings.
00:27:49,00:27:51,You might be disappointed.
00:27:51,00:27:54,They're actually not even real duck droppings.
00:27:54,00:27:56,They're artificial duck droppings.
00:27:56,00:28:01,"For people, you know when people can't commit to a child, those weird people who, by one"
00:28:01,00:28:04,"of those strange life-like dolls instead, was it for people who couldn't commit to having"
00:28:04,00:28:05,a real pet duck?
00:28:05,00:28:06,So.
00:28:06,00:28:07,Yeah.
00:28:07,00:28:09,"Yeah, that was it."
00:28:09,00:28:13,That's very thoughtful to invention.
00:28:13,00:28:17,"So just back to Claire Patrick quickly, she was pretty wild."
00:28:17,00:28:21,"She seemed to have a lot of fun in her life, according to, well, the contemporary records."
00:28:21,00:28:28,"When she got into a carpet warehouse, she, sometimes they wouldn't find it for weeks."
00:28:28,00:28:30,Imagine how are the Oscars as well.
00:28:30,00:28:32,And Claire Patrick's not a bit weirdly.
00:28:32,00:28:34,The red carpet hasn't been delivered either.
00:28:34,00:28:36,"Oh, my God."
00:28:36,00:28:38,What's happening here?
00:28:38,00:28:41,That's different.
00:28:41,00:28:43,Was it Elizabeth Taylor who played Claire Patrick?
00:28:43,00:28:44,Yeah.
00:28:44,00:28:45,You should have arrived like that.
00:28:45,00:28:48,That would have been amazing.
00:28:48,00:28:56,"Okay, it is signed for our final fact of the show, and that is James."
00:28:56,00:29:03,"Okay, my fact this week came on Twitter through @FlockOfWords, and it is that Manatee's"
00:29:03,00:29:08,control their buoyancy through flatulence.
00:29:08,00:29:09,Very clever.
00:29:09,00:29:10,"Yeah, it's very clever."
00:29:10,00:29:14,"There's loads of good ways that animals control their buoyancy, because if you think about"
00:29:14,00:29:19,"it, if you're living in water, you want to decide how high and low you're going to be, don't"
00:29:19,00:29:20,you?
00:29:20,00:29:21,"Yeah, yeah."
00:29:21,00:29:22,So cuttlefish.
00:29:22,00:29:24,Cuttlefish have a bone with holes in it.
00:29:24,00:29:27,"Okay, cuttle bone, it's known as."
00:29:27,00:29:31,"And the hollow structure contains both liquid and gas, and the cuttlefish can change its"
00:29:31,00:29:35,density by varying the quantity of liquid within its bones.
00:29:35,00:29:36,That is amazing.
00:29:36,00:29:37,What?
00:29:37,00:29:38,Isn't that amazing?
00:29:38,00:29:39,"Yeah, that's incredible."
00:29:39,00:29:41,Do we do anything like that as humans?
00:29:41,00:29:43,"No, we go up and downstairs."
00:29:43,00:29:45,"Yeah, but do we do anything on the way?"
00:29:45,00:29:47,"I mean, I fart a bit."
00:29:47,00:29:50,"Well, think about it this way."
00:29:50,00:29:55,"If you're in a swimming pool, and you hold your breath, actually you wouldn't sink under"
00:29:55,00:29:56,the water.
00:29:56,00:29:57,You'll be naturally buoyant.
00:29:57,00:29:58,Yes.
00:29:58,00:30:01,"And then if you let all the air out, you'd naturally go down."
00:30:01,00:30:02,Right.
00:30:02,00:30:03,Okay.
00:30:03,00:30:06,Antarctic krill do things a bit like humans.
00:30:06,00:30:11,"They don't have these bones like cuttlefish, and they don't fart like manatees."
00:30:11,00:30:14,But what they do is they kind of tread water all the time.
00:30:14,00:30:18,So they're always kind of moving their little swimming legs back in front to make sure that
00:30:18,00:30:19,they stay at the right level.
00:30:19,00:30:20,That sounds so annoying.
00:30:20,00:30:21,I know.
00:30:21,00:30:22,Imagine that your whole life.
00:30:22,00:30:23,You're just treading water.
00:30:23,00:30:27,"Oh, that's a horrible metaphor, isn't it?"
00:30:27,00:30:32,"They migrate, I think daily, and they migrate, and they don't migrate across, they migrate"
00:30:32,00:30:33,down and up.
00:30:33,00:30:34,Yeah.
00:30:34,00:30:39,"And they move to different bits of the water column, as it's called, depending on food and"
00:30:39,00:30:41,light and heat and this kind of thing.
00:30:41,00:30:42,So that's how animals know where to hunt them.
00:30:42,00:30:46,"Are we sure they do that because of that, and not just they're trying to get to the surface,"
00:30:46,00:30:50,"and then they're so knackered, they give up and they drop back down to the bottom again?"
00:30:50,00:30:51,I don't know.
00:30:51,00:30:53,That sounds more plausible.
00:30:53,00:30:54,Yeah.
00:30:54,00:30:57,"And that manatees, they have to hold their breath to be underwater."
00:30:57,00:31:03,"So they constantly have to come up and re-oxygenate, and they can take a lot in in one big breath."
00:31:03,00:31:08,It's something like 90% of the oxygen just gets re- they change 90% of the air.
00:31:08,00:31:09,Sorry.
00:31:09,00:31:10,They're lungs in a single breath.
00:31:10,00:31:11,In a single breath.
00:31:11,00:31:13,"Humans, any change about a tenth in a single breath?"
00:31:13,00:31:14,Wow.
00:31:14,00:31:15,Yeah.
00:31:15,00:31:19,"So what they do, though, is when they go to sleep, they go down and they effectively do a form"
00:31:19,00:31:20,"of sleepwalking, but sleep-sleeping."
00:31:20,00:31:28,"Yeah, wait, sorry, sleep-sleeping, sleep-sleeping, where they come to the surface and they take in"
00:31:28,00:31:30,"breath, but they're still asleep and then go back down."
00:31:30,00:31:31,Wow.
00:31:31,00:31:32,"Yeah, it's just like a bit of sleep."
00:31:32,00:31:33,Are they definitely still asleep?
00:31:33,00:31:34,"Yeah, because I can't tell."
00:31:34,00:31:40,"It's like a half-a-way, they say it's exactly, it's as close to, yeah."
00:31:40,00:31:44,It's like if you know that you got up in the middle of the night to check the clock to see
00:31:44,00:31:48,"what time it was, or it was 4am, and then went back to sleep, but you can remember that."
00:31:48,00:31:52,"It's having a conscious memory, but sort of also being still asleep, kind of thing."
00:31:52,00:31:55,Why don't you keep your clock just with the view of your bed so that you don't have to get
00:31:55,00:31:56,up every time you need to sleep?
00:31:56,00:31:59,"Because my clock is my iPhone, so you've got to press the button to turn it on, to have a"
00:31:59,00:32:00,look.
00:32:00,00:32:01,I see.
00:32:01,00:32:02,Yeah.
00:32:02,00:32:03,It's a bit more complicated.
00:32:03,00:32:06,"That must be so annoying, because they can only last about 20 minutes underwater max without"
00:32:06,00:32:07,going out for hours.
00:32:07,00:32:08,"Yeah, but it was constantly-"
00:32:08,00:32:09,"Well, they nap all the time."
00:32:09,00:32:11,They don't have a long period of sleep.
00:32:11,00:32:13,They're not like eight hours in the evening.
00:32:13,00:32:16,They just nap in small little doses all the time.
00:32:16,00:32:18,"They're pretty lazy, aren't they?"
00:32:18,00:32:19,Manatees.
00:32:19,00:32:20,Yeah.
00:32:20,00:32:21,I've seen them.
00:32:21,00:32:22,I've seen them all close.
00:32:22,00:32:23,Yeah.
00:32:23,00:32:24,"Oh, they look so cool."
00:32:24,00:32:25,They are quite cool.
00:32:25,00:32:28,I saw them in a sea center and also in the wild.
00:32:28,00:32:30,"And in a sea center, they all have scars on them."
00:32:30,00:32:33,This was a few years ago from where boats have hit them.
00:32:33,00:32:36,"Yeah, probably 90% I think are scarred from the friend base."
00:32:36,00:32:37,Wow.
00:32:37,00:32:39,"But they just kind of, they're like cows."
00:32:39,00:32:41,"That's because they're called sea cows sometimes, aren't they?"
00:32:41,00:32:46,"And they just kind of go around the sea, just grazing, and then sleep in for a bit."
00:32:46,00:32:49,"What do you want them to do, build melt squirting robots?"
00:32:49,00:32:50,What?
00:32:50,00:32:55,"But they look like they're really fat, and like they've got loads of blubber to survive"
00:32:55,00:32:56,and call waters.
00:32:56,00:32:57,And they haven't.
00:32:57,00:33:01,"It turns out they're all intestines because they're herbivores, so they have to eat loads"
00:33:01,00:33:02,and loads of plants.
00:33:02,00:33:05,They eat about a tenth of their weight in plants every day.
00:33:05,00:33:06,Yeah.
00:33:06,00:33:08,"And so they have to constantly be grazing and constantly be digesting, which is where they"
00:33:08,00:33:11,get all the methane for their flatulence fron.
00:33:11,00:33:12,Ah.
00:33:12,00:33:15,"But the lack of blubber means they can't survive and call waters, so they have to migrate"
00:33:15,00:33:17,when it gets cold in winter.
00:33:17,00:33:21,"And sometimes they swim into the, you know, the warm water outlets of power plants and things"
00:33:21,00:33:22,like this.
00:33:22,00:33:23,Yeah.
00:33:23,00:33:25,Because you get hundreds of manatees in Florida just converging.
00:33:25,00:33:32,"In fact, did you see in 2015, they got, I think, 19 manatees got stuck in a pint and a drainage"
00:33:32,00:33:35,pipe in Florida because they obviously caught it.
00:33:35,00:33:38,"Did the first one go in, and then the next one tried to save him, and then they just"
00:33:38,00:33:39,fell in love.
00:33:39,00:33:41,Can you imagine how annoying that was with the first one?
00:33:41,00:33:46,"Why wasn't he shouting back, going back up guys, I got this."
00:33:46,00:33:47,"Did they get out, okay?"
00:33:47,00:33:48,"Yeah, they pulled it out, they were fine, they were big days."
00:33:48,00:33:49,Okay.
00:33:49,00:33:51,They had to go in and put them on stretchers.
00:33:51,00:33:52,Really?
00:33:52,00:33:53,Yeah.
00:33:53,00:33:54,It's amazing seeing that they're gone.
00:33:54,00:33:55,"Yeah, they have the pipe open."
00:33:55,00:33:56,"Oh, okay, right."
00:33:56,00:34:03,There's a manatee hotline that you can call in Florida to talk to manatees in your area.
00:34:03,00:34:04,Yeah.
00:34:04,00:34:06,"Well, there's, because obviously there's a lot of interesting rules that happen in"
00:34:06,00:34:09,"Florida when manatees, the stuff about, you know, out of touch, a manatee, there was"
00:34:09,00:34:13,a case where a dad almost went to jail because there was a photo of him touching a manatee.
00:34:13,00:34:14,That's illegal.
00:34:14,00:34:18,"Not, I don't mean disgusting touch, like literally touching a manatee."
00:34:18,00:34:19,"Yeah, I know."
00:34:19,00:34:20,"Okay, I don't think anyone was thinking."
00:34:20,00:34:23,I thought your face suggested that's what I was saying.
00:34:23,00:34:24,"No, it wasn't at all."
00:34:24,00:34:25,Okay.
00:34:25,00:34:26,But thank you for clarifying that.
00:34:26,00:34:32,But so one thing that they often get is phone calls from people saying that we've got
00:34:32,00:34:36,"huge problems, the manatees are in huge danger by the shore."
00:34:36,00:34:42,And often what that is is that manatees actually mate very close just off the coast of Florida
00:34:42,00:34:44,and they do it in mass groups.
00:34:44,00:34:49,And it looks like there's a struggle going on like because the water is going crazy.
00:34:49,00:34:55,"So Nadia Gordon, she's a marine mammal biologist with the state agency in Florida and she says"
00:34:55,00:34:59,the call we usually get is there's a mum and a tea and all the babies are trying to save
00:34:59,00:35:00,it.
00:35:00,00:35:03,"But then in actuality, the large female can have up to 20 something males trying to breed"
00:35:03,00:35:05,the one female.
00:35:05,00:35:06,And that's what's going on.
00:35:06,00:35:09,So it looks like they're in serious trouble and that's a lot of the phone calls.
00:35:09,00:35:10,So that's what happens.
00:35:10,00:35:13,You get all the males who are trying to mate with the female.
00:35:13,00:35:16,"The females in the middle and all the males are trying to get at her, but they don't have"
00:35:16,00:35:19,claws or horns or anything like that or arms or anything so they're just kind of bumping
00:35:19,00:35:20,each other.
00:35:20,00:35:25,So it's kind of like if you're in a nightclub and there was a load of men trying to get
00:35:25,00:35:28,"towards a woman, but they had their arms by their sides and they're kind of bumping"
00:35:28,00:35:29,each other.
00:35:29,00:35:30,I don't know.
00:35:30,00:35:31,It'd be a bit like that.
00:35:31,00:35:32,That's the weirdest.
00:35:32,00:35:42,"But I can imagine it, I like that."
00:35:42,00:35:54,"I would go to that club, yeah, but what happens obviously is that the one who's best at"
00:35:54,00:35:59,"barging people out of the way gets the girl, but then the other ones, what do they do?"
00:35:59,00:36:01,"Well, actually, they tend to just try and mate with each other."
00:36:01,00:36:02,They do that.
00:36:02,00:36:03,Right.
00:36:03,00:36:05,"I'll see in a way, everyone wins."
00:36:05,00:36:06,"Well, in a way."
00:36:06,00:36:07,In a way.
00:36:07,00:36:11,Everyone else has come to join second there.
00:36:11,00:36:15,"So you can obviously, they were mistaken for a mermaid."
00:36:15,00:36:19,"We think in Columbus's journal, he said he'd seen a mermaid, what the look of the refrigerator"
00:36:19,00:36:21,is a mermaid and we think it's a man I see.
00:36:21,00:36:25,"And you can kind of see why they look, if you look into their eyes, there's something"
00:36:25,00:36:27,very human about their faces.
00:36:27,00:36:29,"Well, they don't have eyelashes."
00:36:29,00:36:30,Exactly.
00:36:30,00:36:35,And I muscles close in a circular motion like an aperture on a camera.
00:36:35,00:36:36,Right.
00:36:36,00:36:40,"So there are some differences, obviously, with the human and the man."
00:36:40,00:36:43,Or you've got really weird boyfriends.
00:36:43,00:36:45,"They have large, pendulous breasts."
00:36:45,00:36:46,They do.
00:36:46,00:36:47,There we go.
00:36:47,00:36:48,That's where the name Manatee comes from.
00:36:48,00:36:51,"It's an old caribword, meaning breast."
00:36:51,00:36:52,"Oh, okay."
00:36:52,00:36:57,"And Columbus, when he saw them, he did say that they rose well out of the sea, but they're"
00:36:57,00:36:59,not so beautiful as they're said to be.
00:36:59,00:37:00,No.
00:37:00,00:37:03,"Well, their faces had some masculine traits, and they had scars where they'd been hit by"
00:37:03,00:37:04,boats.
00:37:04,00:37:05,Yeah.
00:37:05,00:37:06,They had no eyelashes.
00:37:06,00:37:07,Yeah.
00:37:07,00:37:09,"On the other hand, those breasts were very pendulous."
00:37:09,00:37:11,They have been at sea for a long time.
00:37:11,00:37:12,That's true.
00:37:12,00:37:13,I guess so.
00:37:13,00:37:14,Yeah.
00:37:14,00:37:15,And they are terrible in bed.
00:37:15,00:37:16,Okay.
00:37:16,00:37:17,That's it.
