00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.480
 Oh hello and welcome to another episode, and no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.680
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.240
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Huntamari, and Anna

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.520
 Chazinski, and once again we have gathered around the microphones only this time not with

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.720
 our four favorite facts from the last seven days, but with the best four facts sent in by

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.600
 you the listener.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.440
 And so in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.640
 Starting with fact number one, and that is you Chazinski.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.760
 Yeah, my fact was tweeted into us by someone called Owen Nelligan, so thanks for this Owen,

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.840
 this fact is that the person who invented the lie detector married the first person he

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:55.840
 interrogated with it.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.760
 Did he say will you eventually marry me, and she said no, and then it came up as a lie?

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.440
 Well, it's so close to that.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.960
 According to a book about the history of lie detection and polygraphs, he, so this is

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.160
 a guy called John Augustus Larson, and he was using a lie detector to interrogate Margaret

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.320
 Taylor, and it was about a diamond ring that she'd had stolen, and so the result of the

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.200
 interrogation was that her diamond ring was found and returned to her, and she was so grateful

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.080
 that she volunteered her services to him to play criminal in other lie detection tests.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.800
 And then after about a year, apparently he had her on the lie detection test, and he said,

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.800
 do you love me?

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.760
 And she said no, and it came up as a lie, and she said, did you tell me that?

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.760
 That's bullshit.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.760
 Yeah, right.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.240
 But no, no, I really don't.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.880
 Oh, well, the machine's saying it.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.880
 Sorry, what?

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.640
 I got something the machine's saying, and I must do it.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.400
 Do you take this man to be a lovely wedding husband?

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.400
 No.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.920
 Sorry.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.080
 Because it made news, the fact that they got married, it was headline news at the time.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.160
 The San Francisco Examiner had it on its front page, it said, inventor of lie detector traps

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.000
 bride.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.600
 They had their wedding as well with all the police force there, and yeah, and they played,

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.600
 they played a prank on them, basically immediately after the ceremony.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.600
 They beat them up.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.200
 Yeah, they handcuffed them, and they packed them into a patty wagon and just abandoned

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.680
 them in a countryside, just left them.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.680
 Yeah.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.680
 It's a classic police prank.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.680
 Yeah.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.680
 So I'm a bit confused about him inventing this thing.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.360
 John Augustus last at the man who married the woman he interrogated.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.360
 Yes.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.760
 So the invention of lie detector involves several stages, I guess.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.520
 But what he did was he integrated a test for blood pressure that had already been invented

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.440
 by someone called William Masterson, and he integrated that with a way to measure your

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.240
 pulse, your respiration, and your skin conductivity, and put that all together.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.480
 And then that was what became called the polygraph.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.640
 So there are lots of different people who might have invented it.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.640
 Yes.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.720
 If only we had a way of telling who was the real one.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.680
 And you say someone called William Masterson, but William Masterson is hugely famous in the

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.360
 world of comic books because he is the inventor of Wonder Woman.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.360
 Oh, yeah.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.360
 Yeah.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.640
 So the inventor of the lie detector also, well, the inventor of one of the stages of the

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.000
 lie detector also created Wonder Woman.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.520
 And it was his wife, Elizabeth, who helped him sort of connect the dots about the idea of

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.160
 emotion and blood pressure being combined as a thing that you could tell people's emotions

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.160
 from.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.160
 And that's for truth or false.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.120
 How did he trap her?

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.560
 With the I assume the lissue, probably, the lissue of truth, because she has a Wonder Woman,

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.560
 has a lissue.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.560
 Yeah.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.560
 And anyone caught in it can't lie.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.560
 She has a lie detector.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.560
 Yeah, that's her weapon.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.120
 That's not a lie detector, though, is it?

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.760
 If you can't lie, that's not a lie detector, because every single thing you say will be

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:44.760
 the truth.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:45.760
 It's just a lie, a inventor.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.760
 Yeah, that's true.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.520
 It's just very quickly on William Marsden.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.600
 He had a really odd relationship, because they're not sure who Wonder Woman was properly based

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.600
 on.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.480
 They think that it was his wife, Elizabeth, but also they think it was this other lady

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.480
 called Olive.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.160
 Turns out that they had an open relationship, and they're based on both, so just a little

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.160
 nugget there.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.160
 He lived with both women, didn't he?

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.160
 Yeah, he did, yeah.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.200
 Which of those two was the one who wore the weird outfit?

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.800
 One of them wore the outfit, but the other one had a golden lissue.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.800
 Yeah.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.960
 He wasn't a very creative man at all.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.480
 He was a bit of a self-promote, wasn't he?

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.920
 I think that's why we associate him with the polygraph these days.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.840
 So there was a Gillette advert in 1938, which he appeared on, to say that the company's

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.880
 raises were better than the competition, but he's using the polygraph.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.880
 Yeah, he sort of hooked people up to it.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.200
 Which race is best?

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.320
 Is it Gillette a Wilkinson sword?

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.440
 And presumably if they said Wilkinson sword, it can cut it.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.680
 Yeah, as polygraphs don't actually work, do they?

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.160
 No, they don't think it's amazing.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.160
 These things are complete crops.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.640
 So they don't work, but they're still used or are they not used anymore?

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.640
 They're used.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.640
 But am I right?

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.640
 I'm saying in court, they don't necessarily take them as solid evidence.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:49.640
 They do.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:50.640
 They do, and Jeremy Kyle though.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.640
 Right.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.120
 But they're used in lots of other processes.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.080
 So there was an article this week about how Trump's having real problems with getting

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.840
 a border control force up.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.440
 So he wanted to increase the US border control by thousands.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.360
 And actually, their numbers are decreasing at the moment in the US border control.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.800
 And one of the reasons for that is that two thirds of them fail the lie detector test

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.880
 that you have to pass to get into US border control.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:12.880
 I didn't know you'd do.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.800
 Do you need to pass one to become president?

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.560
 I do not believe so.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:23.960
 But so if you are a particularly guilty person, just in general, you might fail a lie detector test

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.720
 just because you think of what would happen if you had told a lie, or if you had committed

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.080
 the crime that they're asking you about, so that will cause you a spike in blood pressure

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.320
 or a spike in temperature or a spike in your heart rate or whatever.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.520
 And also, you can normalize the responses.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.560
 So if they are asking you control questions at the beginning, and you let's say you bite

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:49.520
 your tongue or you stab the inside of your leg with a fork or whatever while that's happening,

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.520
 then that will cause a big spike.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.960
 And I think, well, those spikes are normal when he's answering those control questions.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.840
 So later on, when we're asking him about the murder, you might have the same spike and

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:57.960
 they'll say, well, no, you didn't do it.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.800
 Do you think they'll be suspicious because you bring a fork into the polygrip test?

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:02.800
 Right.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.800
 Yeah, they might.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.600
 They might be leading out of your mouth for all that gun biting.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:12.680
 Mr. Murray, is it true that you stole all the fox from the cartoon?

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.680
 Yeah.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:19.240
 So on the guy that this fact is about, he solved the crime that he was put in charge of solving.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:24.080
 So it was his mystery on the campus of the University of California over who was stealing

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.800
 lots of the students' possessions.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.840
 So Margaret Taylor, who he married, had a diamond ring stolen.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.400
 And he figured out who it was because he did a lie detector test on all of these students.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.400
 And this is how it worked.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.400
 He ended up working, apparently, to prove that the lie detector test would work forever more.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.680
 The way it worked was he sat to someone down who was called Helen Graham and asked her if

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.240
 she'd taken the money.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.640
 She exploded with rage to all of her equipment off around over to the recording device to

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:52.000
 tear it up and said it was outrageous that anyone was allowed to use that.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.880
 She had to be restrained and said that otherwise she would have beaten the officer in the face.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.560
 So it sounds like she did it.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:04.040
 And she did it and then admit later on to doing the crime.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.440
 So that's how they work.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.080
 They just send you flying into a rage.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.640
 I think that is how they work, isn't it?

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:16.000
 Like, really, the only way that a polygraph could possibly work in a court of law is by making

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.240
 you admit to something, right?

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.240
 Because people think they work.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.240
 Yeah.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.240
 Yeah.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.240
 So they then become truthful.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.240
 So there was.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:29.480
 This was supposedly a method they used in BC era to determine whether someone was lying

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.480
 or not.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.480
 Supposedly in India, this was used.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:35.480
 What you would do is you get a donkey and you'd cover its tail in soot, right?

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.640
 And then you put the donkey in a tent, okay?

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.040
 And this is a dark tent and it's that night that you do this.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:45.280
 And then you put the suspected liar in there and you say, "We've got a magic donkey."

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:50.520
 And you have to grab the tail of the donkey when you're in there.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.200
 And if it braze, we'll know that you committed the crime.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.640
 But actually, what it is is, if they come out and they haven't got subtle over their

00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:01.480
 hands, then you know that they didn't even grab the donkey's tail in the first place.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.480
 So that's how they tell that you're the wrong one.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:08.080
 There's a story that Charles Napier did that, who's won the Inventors of Logarithms, but

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.000
 he did it with a chicken.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.920
 So he had his dark room, he put soot on his cock, and then asked people, "Andy."

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:22.040
 I knew you were going to say it, but I'm so pleased with it when you did.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:26.440
 No, he put, he did a dark room, put soot on his chicken and then told people it was a magic

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.440
 chicken.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.000
 And again, it was the people without sutted hands who he knew were guilty.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.920
 Yeah, but actually, even if I was innocent, I wouldn't take the risk of the chicken actually

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:36.840
 being magic and wrong.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.240
 Could you do this?

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:43.760
 It could be a magic chicken who's just got it in for you.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:44.760
 Yeah, exactly.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.640
 That chicken's always hated me.

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:51.800
 Because you do assume that if you pull a donkey's tail, it probably will braze.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:57.600
 I think even in the illogical days of the BC era, people knew that they might do that, even

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.400
 if they haven't committed the crime.

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:03.280
 Or we went to say for the BC era, what's the correct way of saying it?

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.280
 I think that's it.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.280
 Oh, I think that's it.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.280
 Before the time of Christ?

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.280
 Yeah.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.080
 Before the common era, I think.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.080
 Yeah.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.080
 What's the E when the BCE?

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.080
 Era.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.080
 James said it.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.080
 It's actually…

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.080
 Just said it naturally.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.080
 Wow.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.880
 But we could switch those two sentences right.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:19.880
 Yeah.

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.760
 Do you want to know another method of telling the truth?

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:23.760
 Yes, please.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:24.760
 Which era is it from?

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.760
 This is from the AD era.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.000
 The anal domini era.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 Exactly.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000
 Yeah.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.320
 What does AD stand for?

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:41.440
 So this is in China, when you're being prosecuted, you have to hold a mouthful of rice during

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.760
 the prosecutor's speech.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.720
 Now, it was believed that when people are anxious, they stop salivating.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:50.320
 And you know that feeling of having a dry mouth when you're nervous.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:56.640
 So if the rice was dry by the time the prosecutor finished speaking, it was believed that you were

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:00.640
 guilty because you hadn't been salivating and the prosecutor's talking about your crime.

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:01.640
 Which is unbelievable.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:05.000
 Because actually, it could have just taken lots of ecstasy, for instance.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.480
 Yeah, that was true.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.480
 Does that give you a dry mouth?

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.480
 Yeah, I've heard.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:10.480
 Yeah.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:18.360
 Do you know who invented the first way of measuring your pulse?

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.840
 Oh, that must be a before-common era thing, isn't it?

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:22.840
 It's not.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:27.120
 So actually, maybe it's the first way that this book I was reading claimed.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.840
 So it was Galileo, apparently.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:29.840
 But it's really clever.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.160
 So at the time, people didn't have watches where you could, you know, obviously check someone's

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.000
 pulse against the ticking of your watch.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.800
 You took a checker by the sun dial.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:41.120
 In the scene of hours.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.440
 Full day.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.680
 So he invented this thing called the pulsillodium.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.160
 And what he did was he rigged up this pendulum.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:53.600
 So he hung this pendulum up and then he got the pendulum going and it was attached to a thread.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:57.880
 So it was swinging and attached to this thread that he could pull on to make it longer or shorter.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.440
 And he'd have the pendulum in one hand with his hand on that thread.

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.080
 And then he'd test someone's pulse with the other hand.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:08.960
 And he'd make the string longer or shorter until it was exactly in time with that person's

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:09.960
 pulse.

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:13.160
 And that's a really accurate way of measuring it because the length of the pendulum tells

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.160
 you how fast their pulse is going and then you know if that's normal, isn't that really

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.160
 clever?

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.160
 That is really cool.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.160
 That is.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.160
 He was pretty clever, wasn't he?

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.160
 He was OK.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.160
 Yeah.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.640
 There is a method where, so this is a test they tried in the 1980s.

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:28.400
 Basically, there were loads of different lie detector tests and would they hope that they're

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.160
 going to get a really accurate one at some point?

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:36.560
 There's a test called P300 which is basically that after you see a very distinct image,

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:41.600
 your brain will have a little burst of activity at 300 milliseconds after you see it, right?

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:42.600
 Right.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:48.520
 So the idea was if someone had committed a crime, let's say I mugged someone who was wearing

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:54.000
 an orange suit and I saw that suit again later, my brain would register that same burst

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 of activity.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.800
 But then an orange suit is quite unusual.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:00.960
 So I think if I saw an orange suit, I would also be, this is the problem.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:04.120
 And you have to find things that the criminal saw and that are unique.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:09.960
 So maybe he works in an orange suit, a factory and he won't register the same thing.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:13.120
 And actually criminals wear orange boiler suits, don't they?

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.120
 Yeah.

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.120
 That's true.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.640
 So he might just be worried about the prospect of getting to prison for a crime he didn't

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:18.640
 commit.

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:19.640
 So that did not work, basically.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:20.640
 Yeah.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.320
 So it's the logic there that if you know that that test happening, if you commit a crime,

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.960
 you should do it in a place with no distinguishing features.

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:34.800
 Like Slough.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:39.160
 OK, it is time for fact number two and that is Andy.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:46.160
 My fact is that Lichtenstein has roughly two companies for every person who lives there.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:50.160
 So this is a fact from a guy called Richard Smith at Richard AV Smith.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.920
 So probably we're not saying that these people all own two companies, are we?

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:54.920
 No, we're not.

00:12:54.920 --> 00:13:00.440
 Other companies are from overseas, but they're registered in Lichtenstein because it's a tax

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:01.440
 haven.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:05.240
 They make all their money from extremely dubious financial arrangements.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:08.840
 They don't make all their money, or indeed any of their money from dubious arrangements,

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:09.840
 I'm sure.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:12.080
 Just in case the lies are listening.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:15.920
 I'm sure they make a lot of their money from practices that are frowned on in the wider

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:20.840
 international community, but which happen to be legal in Lichtenstein.

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:23.240
 But they make money and false teeth, don't they?

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:28.040
 I remember there's an old cue, I fact, that they're the biggest exporters of false teeth in

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.760
 the world in Lichtenstein.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:34.320
 I think China might be about to overtake them, but Lichtenstein has been punching above

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.320
 his weight for some time.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:41.200
 Yeah, they've got 35,000 people, it's amazing that they export more than China.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.400
 How many of the companies are false teeth?

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:47.800
 Almost all of them, but yeah, there's very little tax havens stuff going on.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:52.560
 Are we talking teeth with gums, like as in full sets of dentures?

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:53.560
 Dentures.

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:54.560
 So not individual teeth.

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:57.040
 Well, I guess it depends, doesn't it?

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.040
 I think it's dentures.

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:00.040
 I think it's one company that makes all these dentures.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.040
 Right.

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.040
 I think it's in Lichtenstein.

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.280
 It's a funny old place, isn't it?

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.640
 It's an amazing little place.

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:05.640
 Yeah.

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:08.040
 I mean, it's named after the guy who bought it.

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.640
 That's pretty amazing.

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:15.000
 And the family who still are the royalty there are the descendants of him.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.680
 So it's still the Lichtenstein family.

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.280
 You just never see that because they never use their surname.

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:20.280
 So weird.

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:21.280
 It's like Queen Elizabeth, you know.

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:22.280
 You rarely see Windsor.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:23.280
 She's called England.

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:24.280
 Oh, she not called England.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:30.840
 So it's 160 square kilometers, which is 74th the size of Yorkshire.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:31.840
 Wow.

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:32.840
 Wow.

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:33.840
 I mean, I don't know how big Yorkshire is.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:34.840
 It's quite big.

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.840
 Yorkshire is quite big, but it's smaller than like England, for instance.

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:38.840
 Yeah.

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:39.840
 Yeah.

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:44.780
 I read a really good fact in Lonely Planet about Lichtenstein, which is that their last

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:48.600
 military engagement was in 1866.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:51.600
 The last time they sent soldiers out.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:57.520
 So 80 soldiers went out and 81 returned.

00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:00.400
 They made a friend and brought one back.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:03.880
 Well, what is a friend other than someone that you've captured?

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:07.760
 Well, he knows an Italian guy who's just like, I love you guys.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:08.760
 You're really fun.

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:09.760
 I'll come back to Lichtenstein.

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:13.840
 That sounds like Stockholm Syndrome to me.

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:21.280
 In 2007, 170 Swiss troops marched into Lichtenstein by accident on a training exercise.

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:22.600
 They crossed the border.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:26.280
 So basically, it's their army going into another country, which could be kind of a bad

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:27.800
 thing, I guess.

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:32.120
 But the truth is that Lichtenstein's defence is actually looked after by Switzerland.

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:36.920
 Lichtenstein doesn't really have an army of its own.

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:40.960
 That's such a confusing defence attack strategy that's going through your head.

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:41.960
 So you could march in.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:47.800
 And then if anyone stops you, stop hitting yourself.

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:50.080
 They've done it a few times, actually.

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:53.680
 They threw grenades into Lichtenstein, I think, in the late '60s.

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:54.680
 Really?

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:58.360
 And another time they set a bit on fire with flame throwers, they started a forest fire.

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:01.320
 They did ring to apologise after the 2007 one, didn't they?

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.320
 I think they went in.

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.320
 Lichtenstein didn't notice.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:06.360
 They ran away again quickly after they realised.

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:09.160
 And then they called the next day to say, I'm really sorry, we accidentally invaded

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:10.160
 you.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:13.520
 And then the Minister of the Interior said, it's no problem at all, these things happen.

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:20.080
 So that happened again in 2002 when British Marines invaded Spain by mistake, thinking that

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.240
 they were practising and invading Gibraltar.

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:26.360
 Despite the fact that Gibraltar has a massive rock sticking out of it, and they said, well,

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.240
 the beach is very confusing, actually.

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:29.240
 So they stormed us off.

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:31.000
 They had assault rifles, they had mortars.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.800
 They took up a defensive position, just to face a couple of Spanish fishermen and a

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:39.320
 couple of local policemen who said, Gibraltar's over there, look.

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:43.400
 And the MOD later on said, it was clearly an embarrassing and unfortunate incident.

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:46.800
 They made their apologies and left.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:51.000
 But when they said Gibraltar's over there, does that mean the army asked for directions?

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.480
 No, I don't think they did.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:53.480
 Right.

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:56.880
 I think the Spanish police must have known that they were doing a training exercise.

00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:57.880
 Oh, yes.

00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:58.880
 Yeah.

00:16:58.880 --> 00:16:59.880
 Rather than assuming they were being invaded by British.

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:00.880
 Yeah.

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.960
 Although apologising and leaving is a very British way to invade somewhere.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:04.960
 Yeah.

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:05.960
 Sorry.

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:10.920
 The ruler, Prince of Lixianstein, is the wealthiest monarch in Europe.

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:11.920
 Wow.

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:13.920
 He's in the billions, isn't he?

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.920
 He's five billion, I think, because of all the--

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:16.920
 They're both of the billions.

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:17.920
 Yeah.

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:22.360
 Well, because the crown wealth doesn't actually count towards the queen's personal wealth

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:23.360
 officially.

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:26.160
 Otherwise, obviously, she'd be well up there.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:27.160
 Yeah.

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.160
 But yeah, he's loaded.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:29.160
 But people love him.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:35.200
 So in July 2012, Lixianstein did a bit of a turkey, and they-- there was a referendum

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.200
 on the trip.

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.120
 I think we can call it that.

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:42.680
 There was a referendum on whether the Prince should have all of his powers extended and whether

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.920
 he should have the power to veto the results of any future referendum.

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:48.520
 And 76% of the country said, yes.

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:49.520
 Yeah.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:53.640
 We think if there are ever referendum in future, you should be allowed to overall them immediately.

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:55.400
 So they love the guy.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.400
 Yeah.

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.400
 They do.

00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:00.240
 And he-- he's an interesting character, because during that period, he threatened to just

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.240
 leave.

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.160
 I think that was why they voted.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.160
 I think that was why they voted.

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.160
 Yeah.

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:06.160
 I'm just going to leave.

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:07.160
 I'm going to take all my money.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.640
 I'm going to take the name of the country that is me, because I think of a new name.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:13.280
 I'm taking back that Italian who came back with the army.

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:14.440
 I'm taking everything.

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:18.640
 And he-- because they had another referendum where they wanted to talk about abortion and

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:22.600
 whether it should be legal, because there's a legal in Lixianstein, and they said we want

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:23.600
 it legal.

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.600
 And he just went, no, sorry.

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:26.800
 I'm overruling that.

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:27.800
 It's not happening.

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:32.600
 He once a year throws a big party for everyone in Lixianstein to come to his-- the

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:33.600
 palaces.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:37.280
 Actually, 20 odd percent of those wanted him to leave the country.

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:38.280
 Yes.

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:40.120
 The people invited to this party.

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:42.440
 We'll put them over near the toilet.

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:43.440
 Yeah.

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.240
 It doesn't all grudges like that.

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:49.560
 36,000 people invited to the same party, and it's supposed to be a garden party on his

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:50.560
 lawn.

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:51.800
 So I just want to know how big his lawn is.

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:55.840
 I guess if you own Lixianstein, the whole thing is your garden, so it's just like that's

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:56.840
 the party.

00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:57.840
 That's where you are.

00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:58.840
 So just stay at home.

00:18:58.840 --> 00:18:59.840
 Yeah.

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:00.840
 Well, how do you not attend the party?

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:01.840
 If you're annoyed about the referendum.

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:04.320
 That's why everyone attends the party to leave the country.

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.480
 30,000 isn't that many though, is it?

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:11.480
 If you think about a football game, like Man United Game would have what, 70,000 or something.

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:12.480
 I guess.

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.480
 It's quite a lot.

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:14.480
 I'm thinking of my flat now.

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:17.400
 So I think his garden's probably bigger than your flat.

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.400
 But not by much.

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:19.400
 I know what you're saying.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:20.400
 Yeah.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.400
 I've never been to your flat.

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.400
 No.

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.400
 Oh, sorry, yeah.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:24.400
 We had a party.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:35.360
 I'm afraid not the whole population of the podcast is invited.

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:38.000
 OK, it is time for fact number three.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.240
 And that is by fact.

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:42.360
 My fact was sent in by Luke Haynes.

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:43.800
 That was on email.

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:51.440
 In 47 BC, there was a giant robot, Cleopatra, walking the streets of Alexandria, squirting milk

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:54.440
 from her breasts onto the heads of onlookers.

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:55.440
 OK.

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.440
 Yes.

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.440
 This was sent to you personally.

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:58.440
 Was it that one?

00:19:58.440 --> 00:19:59.440
 This was sent to all of us.

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:02.800
 But I think it was edged towards me in the email.

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:04.280
 Do you stand by it?

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:07.920
 Well, I did when I read it and sent it to you and let you go research it.

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:11.800
 And now having Googled it, I can't find any evidence that it's real.

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:14.720
 It appears in a new statesman article.

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:18.600
 And it's delivered at the top of the piece, very confidently, as if it's fact.

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:20.800
 And I just can't seem to find it anywhere else.

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:23.000
 But I still stand by it.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 OK.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.920
 So I read a review of a book called Cleopatra Alive by Stacey Schiff.

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:28.920
 Yes.

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:33.880
 The review was by Mary Beard, who I think we do trust, as a classist.

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:39.840
 And she wrote about a famous procession in honor of the god Dionysus in the third century

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:43.240
 BC by Ptolemy II.

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:45.320
 So that's before Cleopatra.

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:49.400
 And they wrote that there were floats, and one of the floats had a large statue which

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:54.360
 stood up mechanically without anyone laying a hand on it and sat back down again when it

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:56.840
 had poured a libation of milk.

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.040
 Oh, wow.

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:03.040
 So I don't know if this is the same thing, or even if that's true, but I, you know, that

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:04.120
 is from a good source.

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:05.120
 Yep.

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.520
 But it seems to me like maybe two things have been conflated.

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:08.520
 I don't know, though.

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:10.240
 Was it a statue of Cleopatra?

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.680
 Because that would be truly extraordinary before she was born?

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:13.680
 300 years before she was born.

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:14.680
 Yeah.

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:16.840
 Well, it might not have been before the first Cleopatra, because Cleopatra was actually

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:19.840
 Cleopatra VII.

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:20.840
 Yes.

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:24.760
 So one who is famous, you know, for having affairs with Julius Caesar in marketing and things

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:25.760
 like that.

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:26.760
 She was the seventh.

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:28.800
 You know how she hooked up with Caesar?

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:29.800
 Chop.

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:30.800
 Tinder.

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:31.800
 Yeah.

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:36.720
 It was, it was like their version of Tinder, and this is how it worked.

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:41.640
 She was married at the time to her brother, as was customary, so she actually married both

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:45.160
 of her brothers, both called Ptolemy, and she engineered the death of both of them as

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.160
 well.

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:47.160
 Yeah.

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:51.560
 No, so she decided that she wanted to hang out with Caesar, because he was a very powerful

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:52.560
 man.

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:55.280
 I wanted to have a bit of flirting with him, and she was having a feud with her husband and

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:56.280
 see Ptolemy.

00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:57.800
 And Caesar was Ptolemy's enemy.

00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:59.520
 Sorry, which Ptolemy we're talking about.

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:02.920
 We're talking about Ptolemy her brother, or Ptolemy her brother brother.

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:05.600
 She really had a type, didn't she?

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.920
 She's feeling in the profile of the dating aid, didn't she?

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:11.680
 Must be six foot, called Ptolemy, my brother.

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:19.400
 Yeah, it was Ptolemy her brother, which one?

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:22.800
 Her brother, her brother, her brother.

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:26.700
 Anyway, he said, you obviously can't see Caesar, because he's my enemy, and so she had

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:31.040
 herself wrapped up in a carpet and smuggled into Caesar's personal quarters, and then I think

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.520
 this is a famous depiction of her.

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:35.000
 She's always unrolled in films of Cleopatra, isn't she?

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.000
 Yeah.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000
 I love it.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 It's so fun.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 The idea of being unrolled from a carpet onto the floor.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.680
 You know what, it sounds like fun, but I reckon when you do it, it's not going to be much

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:43.680
 fun.

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:47.320
 Because the carpet will be round by the end of the rolling process, but as it gets closer

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:50.520
 and closer towards your body as you're being unrolled, obviously the carpet will be more

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:53.120
 in your shape, and you'll be sort of bumping over the floor.

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:55.600
 You're going to be bumping, it's going to be.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:56.600
 Yeah.

00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:59.800
 That's if you haven't suffocated in the carpet, maybe there's a delay, you know?

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:03.240
 That would have been a sudden anticlimax, which is a dead clear pattern.

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:04.240
 Rolls out.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.240
 Roll the back up.

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:06.240
 Take her out.

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:11.160
 Wouldn't they furotously imbred then if they were all marrying their siblings?

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.160
 Yes.

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:13.160
 But she wasn't having babies with them.

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:14.160
 No.

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.160
 It was all about keeping power.

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.160
 That would be disgusting.

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:17.160
 Right.

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:18.160
 Yeah.

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:19.160
 It was all about keeping power.

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.520
 So she married one of the tolamies when he was ten, and that was so that he could be the

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:22.520
 co-ruler.

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:23.520
 Ah, okay.

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:27.200
 But the thing is, I don't think they were particularly against having sex with each other.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.200
 I loved it.

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:29.200
 You know?

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.200
 I loved it.

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:34.280
 Cleopatra had only six great-great-grandparents out of a possible 16.

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:36.280
 Wow.

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:37.280
 Wow.

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:38.280
 Wow.

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:41.320
 But on the plus side, she had a lot of extra toes.

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:44.320
 Is that a plus?

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:46.680
 I'm toes on that use, but I feel like I've just got enough.

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:52.440
 It would make the game of this little piggy goes to market, go on a long time, but that's true.

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:54.480
 Just on this little piggy, married as brother.

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:57.400
 It was also called tolamy.

00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:01.920
 Tolamy.

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:07.720
 Speaking of toes, found out a thing a while ago, ancient Egypt.

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:10.720
 This is sort of going into robots.

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:15.400
 Ancient Egypt, they actually worked out how to make a strap-on toe for people who'd lost

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:19.760
 a toe so that it worked so that they could continue to walk like an Egyptian.

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:21.000
 That's a terrible joke.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000
 That's a terrible joke.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.000
 No.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.000
 So it's amazing.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 They found it.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.480
 It's the oldest use of augmenting a human prosthetic where they were able to walk

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:32.720
 something, and they found it, because it's a leather and wooden thing that they would strap

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.120
 onto the toe.

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:39.480
 The flexibility of it was up to 86%, which meant that it literally worked like how a normal

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:40.480
 toe would function.

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:41.480
 It wasn't.

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:44.880
 That was like, they must have had prototype models and refined it and refined it.

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:48.520
 So the flexibility allowed them perfect gate for what they had before.

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:49.520
 Really?

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:52.960
 It was a specific rule in American football that you're not allowed to kick the ball with

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:54.960
 an artificial toe.

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:55.960
 Really?

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:56.960
 Yeah.

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:57.960
 Why?

00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:58.960
 Because it's spring loaded or something?

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:03.640
 Well, basically, they all, pretty much all the rules in American football, because people

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:06.720
 have done something and then they have to make a rule against it.

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:10.920
 But one of the best kickers of all time, I think he just got his record beaten for the longest

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:17.240
 ever kick, didn't have any toes on one of his feet, and he had a special fake toe made

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:19.400
 so that he could kick properly.

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:22.120
 And it shouldn't really have helped him in any way if you look at it.

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:26.280
 It shouldn't have helped, but obviously his opponents didn't like the idea, and so they

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:27.280
 banned it.

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:28.280
 That was really messy.

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:29.280
 Yeah, that's a shame.

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:30.280
 Was it that?

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:31.280
 Yeah.

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:36.840
 Can I just say, this prosthetic toe dates back between the time of 950 and 710 BC.

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:37.840
 Wow.

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:38.840
 It's really old.

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:39.840
 Yeah.

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:40.840
 It's really advanced technology.

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:43.200
 I have another thing from around 950 BC.

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.200
 Oh, yeah.

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:50.200
 Okay, so this is an automaton by King Mu of Zhu in China.

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:53.840
 I've probably pronounced that wrong, but that's how it looks.

00:25:53.840 --> 00:26:00.320
 He had an engineer called Yanxi, and Yanxi gave him a human-shaped figure, which walked

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:05.920
 with rapid strides, moved its head up and down, and touched its chin, and began singing

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:06.920
 in tune.

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:14.760
 Okay, this was supposedly 950 BC, and the King obviously thought it was amazing, but then

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:19.280
 as the performance was drawing to an end, the robot winked its eye and made advances to

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:20.520
 the ladies of the audience.

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:22.520
 Oh, no.

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:27.120
 And so the King demanded that it be broken down until it was proved that it was actually

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:29.720
 an automaton, because he thought it was some kind of a live thing.

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:30.720
 Also, who was an automaton?

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:34.760
 And I assume the climax was going to be that that was obviously just a sleazy man.

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:38.320
 Just painted himself silver.

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:39.320
 Yeah.

00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:43.840
 Well, I mean, it's a story from ancient China, so maybe it's not even true.

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:44.840
 The BC era.

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:52.520
 Yeah, they did have amazing things in the 18th century, so these are automaton, which

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:54.520
 so the recorded we have drawings of them and things like that.

00:26:54.520 --> 00:27:00.360
 So there was one called the Volcancon duck built by a Frenchman called Jacques de Volcancon

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:02.200
 in 1738.

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:07.160
 It could stretch his wings, it could smooth his feathers, it could splash around in water,

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:12.880
 it could stretch out and take corn from your hand, and then it produced realistic, horrible

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.880
 smelling duck droppings.

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:15.880
 Wow.

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:16.880
 And this was an automaton.

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:17.880
 It was unbelievable.

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:22.280
 And sometimes, when he was making a performing front of ladies, de Volcancon would put it in

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:23.280
 a little skirt.

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:25.280
 I'm not sure why.

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:26.280
 Yeah.

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:29.040
 That's what was the purpose that it served?

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:30.040
 Was it useful?

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:31.040
 No, entertainment.

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:33.080
 It just provided you with duck droppings.

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:34.080
 Yeah.

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:36.280
 But that's all ducks do to be fair.

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:37.280
 Well.

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:38.280
 And more ducks.

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:39.280
 You can eat them.

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:40.280
 That's true.

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:45.360
 Like, if you have one of the greatest engineers in France coming to you with his new invention,

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:49.560
 then all it is is a bit of metal that produces duck droppings.

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:51.560
 You might be disappointed.

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:54.880
 They're actually not even real duck droppings.

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:56.880
 They're artificial duck droppings.

00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:01.480
 For people, you know when people can't commit to a child, those weird people who, by one

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:04.800
 of those strange life-like dolls instead, was it for people who couldn't commit to having

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:05.800
 a real pet duck?

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:06.800
 So.

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:07.800
 Yeah.

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:09.800
 Yeah, that was it.

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:13.240
 That's very thoughtful to invention.

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:17.080
 So just back to Claire Patrick quickly, she was pretty wild.

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:21.560
 She seemed to have a lot of fun in her life, according to, well, the contemporary records.

00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:28.200
 When she got into a carpet warehouse, she, sometimes they wouldn't find it for weeks.

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:30.800
 Imagine how are the Oscars as well.

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:32.600
 And Claire Patrick's not a bit weirdly.

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:34.760
 The red carpet hasn't been delivered either.

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:36.280
 Oh, my God.

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:38.280
 What's happening here?

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:41.280
 That's different.

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:43.280
 Was it Elizabeth Taylor who played Claire Patrick?

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:44.280
 Yeah.

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:45.280
 You should have arrived like that.

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:48.280
 That would have been amazing.

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:56.640
 Okay, it is signed for our final fact of the show, and that is James.

00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:03.280
 Okay, my fact this week came on Twitter through @FlockOfWords, and it is that Manatee's

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:08.960
 control their buoyancy through flatulence.

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:09.960
 Very clever.

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:10.960
 Yeah, it's very clever.

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:14.200
 There's loads of good ways that animals control their buoyancy, because if you think about

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:19.080
 it, if you're living in water, you want to decide how high and low you're going to be, don't

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:20.080
 you?

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:21.080
 Yeah, yeah.

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:22.080
 So cuttlefish.

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:24.680
 Cuttlefish have a bone with holes in it.

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:27.320
 Okay, cuttle bone, it's known as.

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:31.880
 And the hollow structure contains both liquid and gas, and the cuttlefish can change its

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:35.480
 density by varying the quantity of liquid within its bones.

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:36.480
 That is amazing.

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:37.480
 What?

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:38.480
 Isn't that amazing?

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:39.480
 Yeah, that's incredible.

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:41.640
 Do we do anything like that as humans?

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:43.480
 No, we go up and downstairs.

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:45.480
 Yeah, but do we do anything on the way?

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:47.480
 I mean, I fart a bit.

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:50.160
 Well, think about it this way.

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:55.680
 If you're in a swimming pool, and you hold your breath, actually you wouldn't sink under

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:56.680
 the water.

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:57.680
 You'll be naturally buoyant.

00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:58.680
 Yes.

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:01.280
 And then if you let all the air out, you'd naturally go down.

00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:02.280
 Right.

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:03.280
 Okay.

00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:06.320
 Antarctic krill do things a bit like humans.

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:11.040
 They don't have these bones like cuttlefish, and they don't fart like manatees.

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:14.440
 But what they do is they kind of tread water all the time.

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:18.160
 So they're always kind of moving their little swimming legs back in front to make sure that

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:19.640
 they stay at the right level.

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:20.640
 That sounds so annoying.

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:21.640
 I know.

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:22.640
 Imagine that your whole life.

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:23.640
 You're just treading water.

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:27.560
 Oh, that's a horrible metaphor, isn't it?

00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:32.920
 They migrate, I think daily, and they migrate, and they don't migrate across, they migrate

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:33.920
 down and up.

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:34.920
 Yeah.

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:39.280
 And they move to different bits of the water column, as it's called, depending on food and

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:41.080
 light and heat and this kind of thing.

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:42.760
 So that's how animals know where to hunt them.

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:46.720
 Are we sure they do that because of that, and not just they're trying to get to the surface,

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:50.120
 and then they're so knackered, they give up and they drop back down to the bottom again?

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:51.120
 I don't know.

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:53.120
 That sounds more plausible.

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:54.120
 Yeah.

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:57.560
 And that manatees, they have to hold their breath to be underwater.

00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:03.480
 So they constantly have to come up and re-oxygenate, and they can take a lot in in one big breath.

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:08.840
 It's something like 90% of the oxygen just gets re- they change 90% of the air.

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:09.840
 Sorry.

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:10.840
 They're lungs in a single breath.

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:11.840
 In a single breath.

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:13.800
 Humans, any change about a tenth in a single breath?

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:14.800
 Wow.

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:15.800
 Yeah.

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:19.000
 So what they do, though, is when they go to sleep, they go down and they effectively do a form

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.720
 of sleepwalking, but sleep-sleeping.

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:28.480
 Yeah, wait, sorry, sleep-sleeping, sleep-sleeping, where they come to the surface and they take in

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:30.520
 breath, but they're still asleep and then go back down.

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:31.520
 Wow.

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:32.520
 Yeah, it's just like a bit of sleep.

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:33.520
 Are they definitely still asleep?

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:34.520
 Yeah, because I can't tell.

00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:40.920
 It's like a half-a-way, they say it's exactly, it's as close to, yeah.

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:44.600
 It's like if you know that you got up in the middle of the night to check the clock to see

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:48.120
 what time it was, or it was 4am, and then went back to sleep, but you can remember that.

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:52.200
 It's having a conscious memory, but sort of also being still asleep, kind of thing.

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:55.040
 Why don't you keep your clock just with the view of your bed so that you don't have to get

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:56.040
 up every time you need to sleep?

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:59.040
 Because my clock is my iPhone, so you've got to press the button to turn it on, to have a

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:00.040
 look.

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:01.040
 I see.

00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:02.040
 Yeah.

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.040
 It's a bit more complicated.

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:06.320
 That must be so annoying, because they can only last about 20 minutes underwater max without

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:07.320
 going out for hours.

00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:08.320
 Yeah, but it was constantly-

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:09.800
 Well, they nap all the time.

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:11.440
 They don't have a long period of sleep.

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:13.560
 They're not like eight hours in the evening.

00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:16.440
 They just nap in small little doses all the time.

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:18.160
 They're pretty lazy, aren't they?

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:19.160
 Manatees.

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.160
 Yeah.

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:21.160
 I've seen them.

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:22.160
 I've seen them all close.

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.160
 Yeah.

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:24.160
 Oh, they look so cool.

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:25.160
 They are quite cool.

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:28.080
 I saw them in a sea center and also in the wild.

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:30.880
 And in a sea center, they all have scars on them.

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:33.160
 This was a few years ago from where boats have hit them.

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:36.280
 Yeah, probably 90% I think are scarred from the friend base.

00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:37.280
 Wow.

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:39.760
 But they just kind of, they're like cows.

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:41.720
 That's because they're called sea cows sometimes, aren't they?

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:46.200
 And they just kind of go around the sea, just grazing, and then sleep in for a bit.

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:49.880
 What do you want them to do, build melt squirting robots?

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:50.880
 What?

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:55.320
 But they look like they're really fat, and like they've got loads of blubber to survive

00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:56.320
 and call waters.

00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:57.320
 And they haven't.

00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:01.080
 It turns out they're all intestines because they're herbivores, so they have to eat loads

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:02.080
 and loads of plants.

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:05.080
 They eat about a tenth of their weight in plants every day.

00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:06.080
 Yeah.

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:08.760
 And so they have to constantly be grazing and constantly be digesting, which is where they

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:11.280
 get all the methane for their flatulence fron.

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:12.280
 Ah.

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:15.800
 But the lack of blubber means they can't survive and call waters, so they have to migrate

00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:17.440
 when it gets cold in winter.

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:21.320
 And sometimes they swim into the, you know, the warm water outlets of power plants and things

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:22.320
 like this.

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:23.320
 Yeah.

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:25.520
 Because you get hundreds of manatees in Florida just converging.

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:32.880
 In fact, did you see in 2015, they got, I think, 19 manatees got stuck in a pint and a drainage

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:35.480
 pipe in Florida because they obviously caught it.

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:38.840
 Did the first one go in, and then the next one tried to save him, and then they just

00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:39.840
 fell in love.

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:41.760
 Can you imagine how annoying that was with the first one?

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:46.240
 Why wasn't he shouting back, going back up guys, I got this.

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:47.240
 Did they get out, okay?

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:48.840
 Yeah, they pulled it out, they were fine, they were big days.

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:49.840
 Okay.

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:51.840
 They had to go in and put them on stretchers.

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:52.840
 Really?

00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:53.840
 Yeah.

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:54.840
 It's amazing seeing that they're gone.

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:55.840
 Yeah, they have the pipe open.

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:56.840
 Oh, okay, right.

00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:03.000
 There's a manatee hotline that you can call in Florida to talk to manatees in your area.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.000
 Yeah.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.720
 Well, there's, because obviously there's a lot of interesting rules that happen in

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:09.760
 Florida when manatees, the stuff about, you know, out of touch, a manatee, there was

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:13.760
 a case where a dad almost went to jail because there was a photo of him touching a manatee.

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:14.760
 That's illegal.

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:18.960
 Not, I don't mean disgusting touch, like literally touching a manatee.

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:19.960
 Yeah, I know.

00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:20.960
 Okay, I don't think anyone was thinking.

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:23.080
 I thought your face suggested that's what I was saying.

00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:24.080
 No, it wasn't at all.

00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:25.080
 Okay.

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:26.440
 But thank you for clarifying that.

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:32.240
 But so one thing that they often get is phone calls from people saying that we've got

00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:36.880
 huge problems, the manatees are in huge danger by the shore.

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:42.720
 And often what that is is that manatees actually mate very close just off the coast of Florida

00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:44.720
 and they do it in mass groups.

00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:49.360
 And it looks like there's a struggle going on like because the water is going crazy.

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:55.120
 So Nadia Gordon, she's a marine mammal biologist with the state agency in Florida and she says

00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:59.080
 the call we usually get is there's a mum and a tea and all the babies are trying to save

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:00.080
 it.

00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:03.760
 But then in actuality, the large female can have up to 20 something males trying to breed

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:05.360
 the one female.

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:06.360
 And that's what's going on.

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:09.200
 So it looks like they're in serious trouble and that's a lot of the phone calls.

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:10.200
 So that's what happens.

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:13.080
 You get all the males who are trying to mate with the female.

00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:16.160
 The females in the middle and all the males are trying to get at her, but they don't have

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:19.680
 claws or horns or anything like that or arms or anything so they're just kind of bumping

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:20.680
 each other.

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:25.560
 So it's kind of like if you're in a nightclub and there was a load of men trying to get

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:28.960
 towards a woman, but they had their arms by their sides and they're kind of bumping

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:29.960
 each other.

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:30.960
 I don't know.

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:31.960
 It'd be a bit like that.

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:32.960
 That's the weirdest.

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:42.960
 But I can imagine it, I like that.

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:54.640
 I would go to that club, yeah, but what happens obviously is that the one who's best at

00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:59.440
 barging people out of the way gets the girl, but then the other ones, what do they do?

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:01.880
 Well, actually, they tend to just try and mate with each other.

00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:02.880
 They do that.

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:03.880
 Right.

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:05.680
 I'll see in a way, everyone wins.

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:06.680
 Well, in a way.

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:07.680
 In a way.

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:11.680
 Everyone else has come to join second there.

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:15.400
 So you can obviously, they were mistaken for a mermaid.

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:19.360
 We think in Columbus's journal, he said he'd seen a mermaid, what the look of the refrigerator

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:21.120
 is a mermaid and we think it's a man I see.

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:25.520
 And you can kind of see why they look, if you look into their eyes, there's something

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:27.120
 very human about their faces.

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:29.520
 Well, they don't have eyelashes.

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:30.520
 Exactly.

00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:35.560
 And I muscles close in a circular motion like an aperture on a camera.

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:36.560
 Right.

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:40.920
 So there are some differences, obviously, with the human and the man.

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:43.640
 Or you've got really weird boyfriends.

00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:45.920
 They have large, pendulous breasts.

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:46.920
 They do.

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:47.920
 There we go.

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:48.920
 That's where the name Manatee comes from.

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:51.760
 It's an old caribword, meaning breast.

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:52.760
 Oh, okay.

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:57.160
 And Columbus, when he saw them, he did say that they rose well out of the sea, but they're

00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:59.400
 not so beautiful as they're said to be.

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.400
 No.

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:03.800
 Well, their faces had some masculine traits, and they had scars where they'd been hit by

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:04.800
 boats.

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:05.800
 Yeah.

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:06.800
 They had no eyelashes.

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:07.800
 Yeah.

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:09.840
 On the other hand, those breasts were very pendulous.

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:11.760
 They have been at sea for a long time.

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:12.760
 That's true.

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:13.760
 I guess so.

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:14.760
 Yeah.

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:15.760
 And they are terrible in bed.

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:16.760
 Okay.

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:17.760
 That's it.

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:25.760
 That's all of your facts.

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:27.200
