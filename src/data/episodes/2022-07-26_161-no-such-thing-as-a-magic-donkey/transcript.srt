00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,480
 Oh hello and welcome to another episode, and no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast

2
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,680
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

3
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,240
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Huntamari, and Anna

4
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,520
 Chazinski, and once again we have gathered around the microphones only this time not with

5
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,720
 our four favorite facts from the last seven days, but with the best four facts sent in by

6
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,600
 you the listener.

7
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,440
 And so in no particular order, here we go.

8
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,640
 Starting with fact number one, and that is you Chazinski.

9
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,760
 Yeah, my fact was tweeted into us by someone called Owen Nelligan, so thanks for this Owen,

10
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,840
 this fact is that the person who invented the lie detector married the first person he

11
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,840
 interrogated with it.

12
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,760
 Did he say will you eventually marry me, and she said no, and then it came up as a lie?

13
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,440
 Well, it's so close to that.

14
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,960
 According to a book about the history of lie detection and polygraphs, he, so this is

15
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:11,160
 a guy called John Augustus Larson, and he was using a lie detector to interrogate Margaret

16
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:16,320
 Taylor, and it was about a diamond ring that she'd had stolen, and so the result of the

17
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,200
 interrogation was that her diamond ring was found and returned to her, and she was so grateful

18
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,080
 that she volunteered her services to him to play criminal in other lie detection tests.

19
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,800
 And then after about a year, apparently he had her on the lie detection test, and he said,

20
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,800
 do you love me?

21
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,760
 And she said no, and it came up as a lie, and she said, did you tell me that?

22
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,760
 That's bullshit.

23
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,760
 Yeah, right.

24
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,240
 But no, no, I really don't.

25
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,880
 Oh, well, the machine's saying it.

26
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,880
 Sorry, what?

27
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,640
 I got something the machine's saying, and I must do it.

28
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,400
 Do you take this man to be a lovely wedding husband?

29
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,400
 No.

30
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,920
 Sorry.

31
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,080
 Because it made news, the fact that they got married, it was headline news at the time.

32
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:01,160
 The San Francisco Examiner had it on its front page, it said, inventor of lie detector traps

33
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,000
 bride.

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,600
 They had their wedding as well with all the police force there, and yeah, and they played,

35
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,600
 they played a prank on them, basically immediately after the ceremony.

36
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,600
 They beat them up.

37
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,200
 Yeah, they handcuffed them, and they packed them into a patty wagon and just abandoned

38
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,680
 them in a countryside, just left them.

39
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,680
 Yeah.

40
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,680
 It's a classic police prank.

41
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,680
 Yeah.

42
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,680
 So I'm a bit confused about him inventing this thing.

43
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,360
 John Augustus last at the man who married the woman he interrogated.

44
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,360
 Yes.

45
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,760
 So the invention of lie detector involves several stages, I guess.

46
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,520
 But what he did was he integrated a test for blood pressure that had already been invented

47
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:42,440
 by someone called William Masterson, and he integrated that with a way to measure your

48
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:47,240
 pulse, your respiration, and your skin conductivity, and put that all together.

49
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,480
 And then that was what became called the polygraph.

50
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,640
 So there are lots of different people who might have invented it.

51
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,640
 Yes.

52
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,720
 If only we had a way of telling who was the real one.

53
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,680
 And you say someone called William Masterson, but William Masterson is hugely famous in the

54
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,360
 world of comic books because he is the inventor of Wonder Woman.

55
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,360
 Oh, yeah.

56
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,360
 Yeah.

57
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,640
 So the inventor of the lie detector also, well, the inventor of one of the stages of the

58
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,000
 lie detector also created Wonder Woman.

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,520
 And it was his wife, Elizabeth, who helped him sort of connect the dots about the idea of

60
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:24,160
 emotion and blood pressure being combined as a thing that you could tell people's emotions

61
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,160
 from.

62
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,160
 And that's for truth or false.

63
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,120
 How did he trap her?

64
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,560
 With the I assume the lissue, probably, the lissue of truth, because she has a Wonder Woman,

65
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,560
 has a lissue.

66
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,560
 Yeah.

67
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,560
 And anyone caught in it can't lie.

68
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,560
 She has a lie detector.

69
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,560
 Yeah, that's her weapon.

70
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,120
 That's not a lie detector, though, is it?

71
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,760
 If you can't lie, that's not a lie detector, because every single thing you say will be

72
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,760
 the truth.

73
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,760
 It's just a lie, a inventor.

74
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,760
 Yeah, that's true.

75
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,520
 It's just very quickly on William Marsden.

76
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,600
 He had a really odd relationship, because they're not sure who Wonder Woman was properly based

77
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,600
 on.

78
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,480
 They think that it was his wife, Elizabeth, but also they think it was this other lady

79
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,480
 called Olive.

80
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,160
 Turns out that they had an open relationship, and they're based on both, so just a little

81
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,160
 nugget there.

82
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,160
 He lived with both women, didn't he?

83
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,160
 Yeah, he did, yeah.

84
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,200
 Which of those two was the one who wore the weird outfit?

85
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,800
 One of them wore the outfit, but the other one had a golden lissue.

86
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,800
 Yeah.

87
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,960
 He wasn't a very creative man at all.

88
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,480
 He was a bit of a self-promote, wasn't he?

89
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,920
 I think that's why we associate him with the polygraph these days.

90
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:23,840
 So there was a Gillette advert in 1938, which he appeared on, to say that the company's

91
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,880
 raises were better than the competition, but he's using the polygraph.

92
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,880
 Yeah, he sort of hooked people up to it.

93
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,200
 Which race is best?

94
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,320
 Is it Gillette a Wilkinson sword?

95
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,440
 And presumably if they said Wilkinson sword, it can cut it.

96
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,680
 Yeah, as polygraphs don't actually work, do they?

97
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,160
 No, they don't think it's amazing.

98
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,160
 These things are complete crops.

99
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,640
 So they don't work, but they're still used or are they not used anymore?

100
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,640
 They're used.

101
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,640
 But am I right?

102
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,640
 I'm saying in court, they don't necessarily take them as solid evidence.

103
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,640
 They do.

104
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,640
 They do, and Jeremy Kyle though.

105
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,640
 Right.

106
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,120
 But they're used in lots of other processes.

107
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,080
 So there was an article this week about how Trump's having real problems with getting

108
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,840
 a border control force up.

109
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,440
 So he wanted to increase the US border control by thousands.

110
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,360
 And actually, their numbers are decreasing at the moment in the US border control.

111
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,800
 And one of the reasons for that is that two thirds of them fail the lie detector test

112
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,880
 that you have to pass to get into US border control.

113
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,880
 I didn't know you'd do.

114
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,800
 Do you need to pass one to become president?

115
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,560
 I do not believe so.

116
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:23,960
 But so if you are a particularly guilty person, just in general, you might fail a lie detector test

117
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:28,720
 just because you think of what would happen if you had told a lie, or if you had committed

118
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,080
 the crime that they're asking you about, so that will cause you a spike in blood pressure

119
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,320
 or a spike in temperature or a spike in your heart rate or whatever.

120
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,520
 And also, you can normalize the responses.

121
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,560
 So if they are asking you control questions at the beginning, and you let's say you bite

122
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:49,520
 your tongue or you stab the inside of your leg with a fork or whatever while that's happening,

123
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,520
 then that will cause a big spike.

124
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,960
 And I think, well, those spikes are normal when he's answering those control questions.

125
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,840
 So later on, when we're asking him about the murder, you might have the same spike and

126
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,960
 they'll say, well, no, you didn't do it.

127
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,800
 Do you think they'll be suspicious because you bring a fork into the polygrip test?

128
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,800
 Right.

129
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,800
 Yeah, they might.

130
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,600
 They might be leading out of your mouth for all that gun biting.

131
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:12,680
 Mr. Murray, is it true that you stole all the fox from the cartoon?

132
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,680
 Yeah.

133
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,240
 So on the guy that this fact is about, he solved the crime that he was put in charge of solving.

134
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:24,080
 So it was his mystery on the campus of the University of California over who was stealing

135
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,800
 lots of the students' possessions.

136
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,840
 So Margaret Taylor, who he married, had a diamond ring stolen.

137
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:33,400
 And he figured out who it was because he did a lie detector test on all of these students.

138
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,400
 And this is how it worked.

139
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,400
 He ended up working, apparently, to prove that the lie detector test would work forever more.

140
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,680
 The way it worked was he sat to someone down who was called Helen Graham and asked her if

141
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,240
 she'd taken the money.

142
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,640
 She exploded with rage to all of her equipment off around over to the recording device to

143
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,000
 tear it up and said it was outrageous that anyone was allowed to use that.

144
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,880
 She had to be restrained and said that otherwise she would have beaten the officer in the face.

145
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,560
 So it sounds like she did it.

146
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:04,040
 And she did it and then admit later on to doing the crime.

147
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,440
 So that's how they work.

148
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,080
 They just send you flying into a rage.

149
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,640
 I think that is how they work, isn't it?

150
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:16,000
 Like, really, the only way that a polygraph could possibly work in a court of law is by making

151
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,240
 you admit to something, right?

152
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,240
 Because people think they work.

153
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,240
 Yeah.

154
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,240
 Yeah.

155
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,240
 So they then become truthful.

156
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,240
 So there was.

157
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:29,480
 This was supposedly a method they used in BC era to determine whether someone was lying

158
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,480
 or not.

159
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,480
 Supposedly in India, this was used.

160
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:35,480
 What you would do is you get a donkey and you'd cover its tail in soot, right?

161
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,640
 And then you put the donkey in a tent, okay?

162
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,040
 And this is a dark tent and it's that night that you do this.

163
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:45,280
 And then you put the suspected liar in there and you say, "We've got a magic donkey."

164
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,520
 And you have to grab the tail of the donkey when you're in there.

165
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,200
 And if it braze, we'll know that you committed the crime.

166
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,640
 But actually, what it is is, if they come out and they haven't got subtle over their

167
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:01,480
 hands, then you know that they didn't even grab the donkey's tail in the first place.

168
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,480
 So that's how they tell that you're the wrong one.

169
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:08,080
 There's a story that Charles Napier did that, who's won the Inventors of Logarithms, but

170
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,000
 he did it with a chicken.

171
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,920
 So he had his dark room, he put soot on his cock, and then asked people, "Andy."

172
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:22,040
 I knew you were going to say it, but I'm so pleased with it when you did.

173
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,440
 No, he put, he did a dark room, put soot on his chicken and then told people it was a magic

174
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,440
 chicken.

175
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,000
 And again, it was the people without sutted hands who he knew were guilty.

176
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,920
 Yeah, but actually, even if I was innocent, I wouldn't take the risk of the chicken actually

177
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,840
 being magic and wrong.

178
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,240
 Could you do this?

179
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,760
 It could be a magic chicken who's just got it in for you.

180
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,760
 Yeah, exactly.

181
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,640
 That chicken's always hated me.

182
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,800
 Because you do assume that if you pull a donkey's tail, it probably will braze.

183
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:57,600
 I think even in the illogical days of the BC era, people knew that they might do that, even

184
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,400
 if they haven't committed the crime.

185
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,280
 Or we went to say for the BC era, what's the correct way of saying it?

186
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,280
 I think that's it.

187
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,280
 Oh, I think that's it.

188
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,280
 Before the time of Christ?

189
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,280
 Yeah.

190
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,080
 Before the common era, I think.

191
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,080
 Yeah.

192
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,080
 What's the E when the BCE?

193
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,080
 Era.

194
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,080
 James said it.

195
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,080
 It's actually…

196
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,080
 Just said it naturally.

197
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,080
 Wow.

198
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,880
 But we could switch those two sentences right.

199
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,880
 Yeah.

200
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,760
 Do you want to know another method of telling the truth?

201
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,760
 Yes, please.

202
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,760
 Which era is it from?

203
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,760
 This is from the AD era.

204
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,000
 The anal domini era.

205
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 Exactly.

206
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 Yeah.

207
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,320
 What does AD stand for?

208
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:41,440
 So this is in China, when you're being prosecuted, you have to hold a mouthful of rice during

209
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,760
 the prosecutor's speech.

210
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,720
 Now, it was believed that when people are anxious, they stop salivating.

211
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,320
 And you know that feeling of having a dry mouth when you're nervous.

212
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:56,640
 So if the rice was dry by the time the prosecutor finished speaking, it was believed that you were

213
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,640
 guilty because you hadn't been salivating and the prosecutor's talking about your crime.

214
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,640
 Which is unbelievable.

215
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,000
 Because actually, it could have just taken lots of ecstasy, for instance.

216
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,480
 Yeah, that was true.

217
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,480
 Does that give you a dry mouth?

218
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,480
 Yeah, I've heard.

219
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,480
 Yeah.

220
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:18,360
 Do you know who invented the first way of measuring your pulse?

221
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,840
 Oh, that must be a before-common era thing, isn't it?

222
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,840
 It's not.

223
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:27,120
 So actually, maybe it's the first way that this book I was reading claimed.

224
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,840
 So it was Galileo, apparently.

225
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,840
 But it's really clever.

226
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,160
 So at the time, people didn't have watches where you could, you know, obviously check someone's

227
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,000
 pulse against the ticking of your watch.

228
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,800
 You took a checker by the sun dial.

229
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,120
 In the scene of hours.

230
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,440
 Full day.

231
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,680
 So he invented this thing called the pulsillodium.

232
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,160
 And what he did was he rigged up this pendulum.

233
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:53,600
 So he hung this pendulum up and then he got the pendulum going and it was attached to a thread.

234
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,880
 So it was swinging and attached to this thread that he could pull on to make it longer or shorter.

235
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,440
 And he'd have the pendulum in one hand with his hand on that thread.

236
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,080
 And then he'd test someone's pulse with the other hand.

237
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,960
 And he'd make the string longer or shorter until it was exactly in time with that person's

238
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,960
 pulse.

239
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,160
 And that's a really accurate way of measuring it because the length of the pendulum tells

240
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,160
 you how fast their pulse is going and then you know if that's normal, isn't that really

241
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,160
 clever?

242
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,160
 That is really cool.

243
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,160
 That is.

244
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,160
 He was pretty clever, wasn't he?

245
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,160
 He was OK.

246
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,160
 Yeah.

247
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,640
 There is a method where, so this is a test they tried in the 1980s.

248
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,400
 Basically, there were loads of different lie detector tests and would they hope that they're

249
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,160
 going to get a really accurate one at some point?

250
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:36,560
 There's a test called P300 which is basically that after you see a very distinct image,

251
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,600
 your brain will have a little burst of activity at 300 milliseconds after you see it, right?

252
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,600
 Right.

253
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:48,520
 So the idea was if someone had committed a crime, let's say I mugged someone who was wearing

254
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:54,000
 an orange suit and I saw that suit again later, my brain would register that same burst

255
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 of activity.

256
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,800
 But then an orange suit is quite unusual.

257
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,960
 So I think if I saw an orange suit, I would also be, this is the problem.

258
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,120
 And you have to find things that the criminal saw and that are unique.

259
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:09,960
 So maybe he works in an orange suit, a factory and he won't register the same thing.

260
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:13,120
 And actually criminals wear orange boiler suits, don't they?

261
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,120
 Yeah.

262
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,120
 That's true.

263
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,640
 So he might just be worried about the prospect of getting to prison for a crime he didn't

264
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,640
 commit.

265
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,640
 So that did not work, basically.

266
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,640
 Yeah.

267
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,320
 So it's the logic there that if you know that that test happening, if you commit a crime,

268
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,960
 you should do it in a place with no distinguishing features.

269
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:34,800
 Like Slough.

270
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,160
 OK, it is time for fact number two and that is Andy.

271
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:46,160
 My fact is that Lichtenstein has roughly two companies for every person who lives there.

272
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,160
 So this is a fact from a guy called Richard Smith at Richard AV Smith.

273
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,920
 So probably we're not saying that these people all own two companies, are we?

274
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,920
 No, we're not.

275
00:12:54,920 --> 00:13:00,440
 Other companies are from overseas, but they're registered in Lichtenstein because it's a tax

276
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,440
 haven.

277
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,240
 They make all their money from extremely dubious financial arrangements.

278
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,840
 They don't make all their money, or indeed any of their money from dubious arrangements,

279
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,840
 I'm sure.

280
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,080
 Just in case the lies are listening.

281
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,920
 I'm sure they make a lot of their money from practices that are frowned on in the wider

282
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,840
 international community, but which happen to be legal in Lichtenstein.

283
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,240
 But they make money and false teeth, don't they?

284
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:28,040
 I remember there's an old cue, I fact, that they're the biggest exporters of false teeth in

285
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,760
 the world in Lichtenstein.

286
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,320
 I think China might be about to overtake them, but Lichtenstein has been punching above

287
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,320
 his weight for some time.

288
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:41,200
 Yeah, they've got 35,000 people, it's amazing that they export more than China.

289
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,400
 How many of the companies are false teeth?

290
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,800
 Almost all of them, but yeah, there's very little tax havens stuff going on.

291
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,560
 Are we talking teeth with gums, like as in full sets of dentures?

292
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,560
 Dentures.

293
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,560
 So not individual teeth.

294
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,040
 Well, I guess it depends, doesn't it?

295
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,040
 I think it's dentures.

296
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,040
 I think it's one company that makes all these dentures.

297
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,040
 Right.

298
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,040
 I think it's in Lichtenstein.

299
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,280
 It's a funny old place, isn't it?

300
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,640
 It's an amazing little place.

301
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,640
 Yeah.

302
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,040
 I mean, it's named after the guy who bought it.

303
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,640
 That's pretty amazing.

304
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:15,000
 And the family who still are the royalty there are the descendants of him.

305
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,680
 So it's still the Lichtenstein family.

306
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,280
 You just never see that because they never use their surname.

307
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,280
 So weird.

308
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,280
 It's like Queen Elizabeth, you know.

309
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,280
 You rarely see Windsor.

310
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,280
 She's called England.

311
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,280
 Oh, she not called England.

312
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:30,840
 So it's 160 square kilometers, which is 74th the size of Yorkshire.

313
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,840
 Wow.

314
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,840
 Wow.

315
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,840
 I mean, I don't know how big Yorkshire is.

316
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,840
 It's quite big.

317
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,840
 Yorkshire is quite big, but it's smaller than like England, for instance.

318
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,840
 Yeah.

319
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,840
 Yeah.

320
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:44,780
 I read a really good fact in Lonely Planet about Lichtenstein, which is that their last

321
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:48,600
 military engagement was in 1866.

322
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,600
 The last time they sent soldiers out.

323
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,520
 So 80 soldiers went out and 81 returned.

324
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,400
 They made a friend and brought one back.

325
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,880
 Well, what is a friend other than someone that you've captured?

326
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,760
 Well, he knows an Italian guy who's just like, I love you guys.

327
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,760
 You're really fun.

328
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,760
 I'll come back to Lichtenstein.

329
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,840
 That sounds like Stockholm Syndrome to me.

330
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:21,280
 In 2007, 170 Swiss troops marched into Lichtenstein by accident on a training exercise.

331
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,600
 They crossed the border.

332
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,280
 So basically, it's their army going into another country, which could be kind of a bad

333
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,800
 thing, I guess.

334
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:32,120
 But the truth is that Lichtenstein's defence is actually looked after by Switzerland.

335
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,920
 Lichtenstein doesn't really have an army of its own.

336
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,960
 That's such a confusing defence attack strategy that's going through your head.

337
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,960
 So you could march in.

338
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:47,800
 And then if anyone stops you, stop hitting yourself.

339
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,080
 They've done it a few times, actually.

340
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,680
 They threw grenades into Lichtenstein, I think, in the late '60s.

341
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,680
 Really?

342
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:58,360
 And another time they set a bit on fire with flame throwers, they started a forest fire.

343
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,320
 They did ring to apologise after the 2007 one, didn't they?

344
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,320
 I think they went in.

345
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,320
 Lichtenstein didn't notice.

346
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,360
 They ran away again quickly after they realised.

347
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,160
 And then they called the next day to say, I'm really sorry, we accidentally invaded

348
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,160
 you.

349
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,520
 And then the Minister of the Interior said, it's no problem at all, these things happen.

350
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:20,080
 So that happened again in 2002 when British Marines invaded Spain by mistake, thinking that

351
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,240
 they were practising and invading Gibraltar.

352
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,360
 Despite the fact that Gibraltar has a massive rock sticking out of it, and they said, well,

353
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,240
 the beach is very confusing, actually.

354
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,240
 So they stormed us off.

355
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,000
 They had assault rifles, they had mortars.

356
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,800
 They took up a defensive position, just to face a couple of Spanish fishermen and a

357
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,320
 couple of local policemen who said, Gibraltar's over there, look.

358
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:43,400
 And the MOD later on said, it was clearly an embarrassing and unfortunate incident.

359
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,800
 They made their apologies and left.

360
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,000
 But when they said Gibraltar's over there, does that mean the army asked for directions?

361
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,480
 No, I don't think they did.

362
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,480
 Right.

363
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,880
 I think the Spanish police must have known that they were doing a training exercise.

364
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,880
 Oh, yes.

365
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,880
 Yeah.

366
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,880
 Rather than assuming they were being invaded by British.

367
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,880
 Yeah.

368
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,960
 Although apologising and leaving is a very British way to invade somewhere.

369
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,960
 Yeah.

370
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,960
 Sorry.

371
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:10,920
 The ruler, Prince of Lixianstein, is the wealthiest monarch in Europe.

372
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,920
 Wow.

373
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,920
 He's in the billions, isn't he?

374
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,920
 He's five billion, I think, because of all the--

375
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,920
 They're both of the billions.

376
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,920
 Yeah.

377
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:22,360
 Well, because the crown wealth doesn't actually count towards the queen's personal wealth

378
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,360
 officially.

379
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,160
 Otherwise, obviously, she'd be well up there.

380
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,160
 Yeah.

381
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,160
 But yeah, he's loaded.

382
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,160
 But people love him.

383
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:35,200
 So in July 2012, Lixianstein did a bit of a turkey, and they-- there was a referendum

384
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,200
 on the trip.

385
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,120
 I think we can call it that.

386
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:42,680
 There was a referendum on whether the Prince should have all of his powers extended and whether

387
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,920
 he should have the power to veto the results of any future referendum.

388
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,520
 And 76% of the country said, yes.

389
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,520
 Yeah.

390
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,640
 We think if there are ever referendum in future, you should be allowed to overall them immediately.

391
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,400
 So they love the guy.

392
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,400
 Yeah.

393
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,400
 They do.

394
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,240
 And he-- he's an interesting character, because during that period, he threatened to just

395
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,240
 leave.

396
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,160
 I think that was why they voted.

397
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,160
 I think that was why they voted.

398
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,160
 Yeah.

399
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,160
 I'm just going to leave.

400
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,160
 I'm going to take all my money.

401
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,640
 I'm going to take the name of the country that is me, because I think of a new name.

402
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,280
 I'm taking back that Italian who came back with the army.

403
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,440
 I'm taking everything.

404
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,640
 And he-- because they had another referendum where they wanted to talk about abortion and

405
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,600
 whether it should be legal, because there's a legal in Lixianstein, and they said we want

406
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,600
 it legal.

407
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,600
 And he just went, no, sorry.

408
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,800
 I'm overruling that.

409
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,800
 It's not happening.

410
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:32,600
 He once a year throws a big party for everyone in Lixianstein to come to his-- the

411
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,600
 palaces.

412
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,280
 Actually, 20 odd percent of those wanted him to leave the country.

413
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,280
 Yes.

414
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,120
 The people invited to this party.

415
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,440
 We'll put them over near the toilet.

416
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,440
 Yeah.

417
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,240
 It doesn't all grudges like that.

418
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,560
 36,000 people invited to the same party, and it's supposed to be a garden party on his

419
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,560
 lawn.

420
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,800
 So I just want to know how big his lawn is.

421
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,840
 I guess if you own Lixianstein, the whole thing is your garden, so it's just like that's

422
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,840
 the party.

423
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,840
 That's where you are.

424
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,840
 So just stay at home.

425
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,840
 Yeah.

426
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,840
 Well, how do you not attend the party?

427
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,840
 If you're annoyed about the referendum.

428
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,320
 That's why everyone attends the party to leave the country.

429
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,480
 30,000 isn't that many though, is it?

430
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,480
 If you think about a football game, like Man United Game would have what, 70,000 or something.

431
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,480
 I guess.

432
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,480
 It's quite a lot.

433
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,480
 I'm thinking of my flat now.

434
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,400
 So I think his garden's probably bigger than your flat.

435
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,400
 But not by much.

436
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,400
 I know what you're saying.

437
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,400
 Yeah.

438
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,400
 I've never been to your flat.

439
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,400
 No.

440
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,400
 Oh, sorry, yeah.

441
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,400
 We had a party.

442
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:35,360
 I'm afraid not the whole population of the podcast is invited.

443
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,000
 OK, it is time for fact number three.

444
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,240
 And that is by fact.

445
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,360
 My fact was sent in by Luke Haynes.

446
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,800
 That was on email.

447
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:51,440
 In 47 BC, there was a giant robot, Cleopatra, walking the streets of Alexandria, squirting milk

448
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,440
 from her breasts onto the heads of onlookers.

449
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,440
 OK.

450
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,440
 Yes.

451
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,440
 This was sent to you personally.

452
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,440
 Was it that one?

453
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,440
 This was sent to all of us.

454
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,800
 But I think it was edged towards me in the email.

455
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,280
 Do you stand by it?

456
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,920
 Well, I did when I read it and sent it to you and let you go research it.

457
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,800
 And now having Googled it, I can't find any evidence that it's real.

458
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,720
 It appears in a new statesman article.

459
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,600
 And it's delivered at the top of the piece, very confidently, as if it's fact.

460
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,800
 And I just can't seem to find it anywhere else.

461
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,000
 But I still stand by it.

462
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 OK.

463
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,920
 So I read a review of a book called Cleopatra Alive by Stacey Schiff.

464
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,920
 Yes.

465
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:33,880
 The review was by Mary Beard, who I think we do trust, as a classist.

466
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:39,840
 And she wrote about a famous procession in honor of the god Dionysus in the third century

467
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,240
 BC by Ptolemy II.

468
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,320
 So that's before Cleopatra.

469
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:49,400
 And they wrote that there were floats, and one of the floats had a large statue which

470
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:54,360
 stood up mechanically without anyone laying a hand on it and sat back down again when it

471
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,840
 had poured a libation of milk.

472
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,040
 Oh, wow.

473
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:03,040
 So I don't know if this is the same thing, or even if that's true, but I, you know, that

474
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,120
 is from a good source.

475
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,120
 Yep.

476
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,520
 But it seems to me like maybe two things have been conflated.

477
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,520
 I don't know, though.

478
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,240
 Was it a statue of Cleopatra?

479
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,680
 Because that would be truly extraordinary before she was born?

480
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,680
 300 years before she was born.

481
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,680
 Yeah.

482
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,840
 Well, it might not have been before the first Cleopatra, because Cleopatra was actually

483
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,840
 Cleopatra VII.

484
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,840
 Yes.

485
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:24,760
 So one who is famous, you know, for having affairs with Julius Caesar in marketing and things

486
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,760
 like that.

487
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,760
 She was the seventh.

488
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,800
 You know how she hooked up with Caesar?

489
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,800
 Chop.

490
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,800
 Tinder.

491
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,800
 Yeah.

492
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:36,720
 It was, it was like their version of Tinder, and this is how it worked.

493
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,640
 She was married at the time to her brother, as was customary, so she actually married both

494
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,160
 of her brothers, both called Ptolemy, and she engineered the death of both of them as

495
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,160
 well.

496
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,160
 Yeah.

497
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:51,560
 No, so she decided that she wanted to hang out with Caesar, because he was a very powerful

498
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,560
 man.

499
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,280
 I wanted to have a bit of flirting with him, and she was having a feud with her husband and

500
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,280
 see Ptolemy.

501
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,800
 And Caesar was Ptolemy's enemy.

502
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,520
 Sorry, which Ptolemy we're talking about.

503
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,920
 We're talking about Ptolemy her brother, or Ptolemy her brother brother.

504
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,600
 She really had a type, didn't she?

505
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,920
 She's feeling in the profile of the dating aid, didn't she?

506
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,680
 Must be six foot, called Ptolemy, my brother.

507
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:19,400
 Yeah, it was Ptolemy her brother, which one?

508
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,800
 Her brother, her brother, her brother.

509
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,700
 Anyway, he said, you obviously can't see Caesar, because he's my enemy, and so she had

510
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:31,040
 herself wrapped up in a carpet and smuggled into Caesar's personal quarters, and then I think

511
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,520
 this is a famous depiction of her.

512
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,000
 She's always unrolled in films of Cleopatra, isn't she?

513
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 Yeah.

514
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 I love it.

515
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 It's so fun.

516
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 The idea of being unrolled from a carpet onto the floor.

517
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,680
 You know what, it sounds like fun, but I reckon when you do it, it's not going to be much

518
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,680
 fun.

519
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:47,320
 Because the carpet will be round by the end of the rolling process, but as it gets closer

520
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,520
 and closer towards your body as you're being unrolled, obviously the carpet will be more

521
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,120
 in your shape, and you'll be sort of bumping over the floor.

522
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,600
 You're going to be bumping, it's going to be.

523
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,600
 Yeah.

524
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,800
 That's if you haven't suffocated in the carpet, maybe there's a delay, you know?

525
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,240
 That would have been a sudden anticlimax, which is a dead clear pattern.

526
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,240
 Rolls out.

527
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,240
 Roll the back up.

528
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,240
 Take her out.

529
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,160
 Wouldn't they furotously imbred then if they were all marrying their siblings?

530
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,160
 Yes.

531
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,160
 But she wasn't having babies with them.

532
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,160
 No.

533
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,160
 It was all about keeping power.

534
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,160
 That would be disgusting.

535
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,160
 Right.

536
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,160
 Yeah.

537
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,160
 It was all about keeping power.

538
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,520
 So she married one of the tolamies when he was ten, and that was so that he could be the

539
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,520
 co-ruler.

540
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,520
 Ah, okay.

541
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,200
 But the thing is, I don't think they were particularly against having sex with each other.

542
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,200
 I loved it.

543
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,200
 You know?

544
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,200
 I loved it.

545
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,280
 Cleopatra had only six great-great-grandparents out of a possible 16.

546
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,280
 Wow.

547
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,280
 Wow.

548
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,280
 Wow.

549
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:41,320
 But on the plus side, she had a lot of extra toes.

550
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,320
 Is that a plus?

551
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,680
 I'm toes on that use, but I feel like I've just got enough.

552
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:52,440
 It would make the game of this little piggy goes to market, go on a long time, but that's true.

553
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,480
 Just on this little piggy, married as brother.

554
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,400
 It was also called tolamy.

555
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:01,920
 Tolamy.

556
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:07,720
 Speaking of toes, found out a thing a while ago, ancient Egypt.

557
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,720
 This is sort of going into robots.

558
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,400
 Ancient Egypt, they actually worked out how to make a strap-on toe for people who'd lost

559
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:19,760
 a toe so that it worked so that they could continue to walk like an Egyptian.

560
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,000
 That's a terrible joke.

561
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 That's a terrible joke.

562
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 No.

563
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 So it's amazing.

564
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 They found it.

565
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,480
 It's the oldest use of augmenting a human prosthetic where they were able to walk

566
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,720
 something, and they found it, because it's a leather and wooden thing that they would strap

567
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,120
 onto the toe.

568
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:39,480
 The flexibility of it was up to 86%, which meant that it literally worked like how a normal

569
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,480
 toe would function.

570
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,480
 It wasn't.

571
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,880
 That was like, they must have had prototype models and refined it and refined it.

572
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,520
 So the flexibility allowed them perfect gate for what they had before.

573
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,520
 Really?

574
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,960
 It was a specific rule in American football that you're not allowed to kick the ball with

575
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,960
 an artificial toe.

576
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,960
 Really?

577
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,960
 Yeah.

578
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,960
 Why?

579
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,960
 Because it's spring loaded or something?

580
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,640
 Well, basically, they all, pretty much all the rules in American football, because people

581
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,720
 have done something and then they have to make a rule against it.

582
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,920
 But one of the best kickers of all time, I think he just got his record beaten for the longest

583
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:17,240
 ever kick, didn't have any toes on one of his feet, and he had a special fake toe made

584
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,400
 so that he could kick properly.

585
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,120
 And it shouldn't really have helped him in any way if you look at it.

586
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:26,280
 It shouldn't have helped, but obviously his opponents didn't like the idea, and so they

587
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,280
 banned it.

588
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,280
 That was really messy.

589
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,280
 Yeah, that's a shame.

590
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,280
 Was it that?

591
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,280
 Yeah.

592
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:36,840
 Can I just say, this prosthetic toe dates back between the time of 950 and 710 BC.

593
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,840
 Wow.

594
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,840
 It's really old.

595
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,840
 Yeah.

596
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,840
 It's really advanced technology.

597
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,200
 I have another thing from around 950 BC.

598
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,200
 Oh, yeah.

599
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:50,200
 Okay, so this is an automaton by King Mu of Zhu in China.

600
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,840
 I've probably pronounced that wrong, but that's how it looks.

601
00:25:53,840 --> 00:26:00,320
 He had an engineer called Yanxi, and Yanxi gave him a human-shaped figure, which walked

602
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:05,920
 with rapid strides, moved its head up and down, and touched its chin, and began singing

603
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,920
 in tune.

604
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:14,760
 Okay, this was supposedly 950 BC, and the King obviously thought it was amazing, but then

605
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:19,280
 as the performance was drawing to an end, the robot winked its eye and made advances to

606
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,520
 the ladies of the audience.

607
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,520
 Oh, no.

608
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:27,120
 And so the King demanded that it be broken down until it was proved that it was actually

609
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,720
 an automaton, because he thought it was some kind of a live thing.

610
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,720
 Also, who was an automaton?

611
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,760
 And I assume the climax was going to be that that was obviously just a sleazy man.

612
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:38,320
 Just painted himself silver.

613
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,320
 Yeah.

614
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:43,840
 Well, I mean, it's a story from ancient China, so maybe it's not even true.

615
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,840
 The BC era.

616
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:52,520
 Yeah, they did have amazing things in the 18th century, so these are automaton, which

617
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,520
 so the recorded we have drawings of them and things like that.

618
00:26:54,520 --> 00:27:00,360
 So there was one called the Volcancon duck built by a Frenchman called Jacques de Volcancon

619
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,200
 in 1738.

620
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:07,160
 It could stretch his wings, it could smooth his feathers, it could splash around in water,

621
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:12,880
 it could stretch out and take corn from your hand, and then it produced realistic, horrible

622
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,880
 smelling duck droppings.

623
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,880
 Wow.

624
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,880
 And this was an automaton.

625
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,880
 It was unbelievable.

626
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,280
 And sometimes, when he was making a performing front of ladies, de Volcancon would put it in

627
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,280
 a little skirt.

628
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,280
 I'm not sure why.

629
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,280
 Yeah.

630
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,040
 That's what was the purpose that it served?

631
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,040
 Was it useful?

632
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,040
 No, entertainment.

633
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,080
 It just provided you with duck droppings.

634
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,080
 Yeah.

635
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,280
 But that's all ducks do to be fair.

636
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,280
 Well.

637
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,280
 And more ducks.

638
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,280
 You can eat them.

639
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,280
 That's true.

640
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:45,360
 Like, if you have one of the greatest engineers in France coming to you with his new invention,

641
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,560
 then all it is is a bit of metal that produces duck droppings.

642
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,560
 You might be disappointed.

643
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,880
 They're actually not even real duck droppings.

644
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,880
 They're artificial duck droppings.

645
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,480
 For people, you know when people can't commit to a child, those weird people who, by one

646
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,800
 of those strange life-like dolls instead, was it for people who couldn't commit to having

647
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,800
 a real pet duck?

648
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,800
 So.

649
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,800
 Yeah.

650
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,800
 Yeah, that was it.

651
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,240
 That's very thoughtful to invention.

652
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:17,080
 So just back to Claire Patrick quickly, she was pretty wild.

653
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:21,560
 She seemed to have a lot of fun in her life, according to, well, the contemporary records.

654
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:28,200
 When she got into a carpet warehouse, she, sometimes they wouldn't find it for weeks.

655
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,800
 Imagine how are the Oscars as well.

656
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,600
 And Claire Patrick's not a bit weirdly.

657
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,760
 The red carpet hasn't been delivered either.

658
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,280
 Oh, my God.

659
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,280
 What's happening here?

660
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,280
 That's different.

661
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,280
 Was it Elizabeth Taylor who played Claire Patrick?

662
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,280
 Yeah.

663
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,280
 You should have arrived like that.

664
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,280
 That would have been amazing.

665
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:56,640
 Okay, it is signed for our final fact of the show, and that is James.

666
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:03,280
 Okay, my fact this week came on Twitter through @FlockOfWords, and it is that Manatee's

667
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:08,960
 control their buoyancy through flatulence.

668
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,960
 Very clever.

669
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,960
 Yeah, it's very clever.

670
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,200
 There's loads of good ways that animals control their buoyancy, because if you think about

671
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:19,080
 it, if you're living in water, you want to decide how high and low you're going to be, don't

672
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,080
 you?

673
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,080
 Yeah, yeah.

674
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,080
 So cuttlefish.

675
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,680
 Cuttlefish have a bone with holes in it.

676
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,320
 Okay, cuttle bone, it's known as.

677
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:31,880
 And the hollow structure contains both liquid and gas, and the cuttlefish can change its

678
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:35,480
 density by varying the quantity of liquid within its bones.

679
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,480
 That is amazing.

680
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,480
 What?

681
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,480
 Isn't that amazing?

682
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,480
 Yeah, that's incredible.

683
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,640
 Do we do anything like that as humans?

684
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,480
 No, we go up and downstairs.

685
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,480
 Yeah, but do we do anything on the way?

686
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,480
 I mean, I fart a bit.

687
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,160
 Well, think about it this way.

688
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:55,680
 If you're in a swimming pool, and you hold your breath, actually you wouldn't sink under

689
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,680
 the water.

690
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,680
 You'll be naturally buoyant.

691
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,680
 Yes.

692
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,280
 And then if you let all the air out, you'd naturally go down.

693
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,280
 Right.

694
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,280
 Okay.

695
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,320
 Antarctic krill do things a bit like humans.

696
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:11,040
 They don't have these bones like cuttlefish, and they don't fart like manatees.

697
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,440
 But what they do is they kind of tread water all the time.

698
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:18,160
 So they're always kind of moving their little swimming legs back in front to make sure that

699
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,640
 they stay at the right level.

700
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,640
 That sounds so annoying.

701
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,640
 I know.

702
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,640
 Imagine that your whole life.

703
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,640
 You're just treading water.

704
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,560
 Oh, that's a horrible metaphor, isn't it?

705
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:32,920
 They migrate, I think daily, and they migrate, and they don't migrate across, they migrate

706
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,920
 down and up.

707
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,920
 Yeah.

708
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:39,280
 And they move to different bits of the water column, as it's called, depending on food and

709
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,080
 light and heat and this kind of thing.

710
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,760
 So that's how animals know where to hunt them.

711
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:46,720
 Are we sure they do that because of that, and not just they're trying to get to the surface,

712
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,120
 and then they're so knackered, they give up and they drop back down to the bottom again?

713
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,120
 I don't know.

714
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,120
 That sounds more plausible.

715
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,120
 Yeah.

716
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:57,560
 And that manatees, they have to hold their breath to be underwater.

717
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:03,480
 So they constantly have to come up and re-oxygenate, and they can take a lot in in one big breath.

718
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:08,840
 It's something like 90% of the oxygen just gets re- they change 90% of the air.

719
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:09,840
 Sorry.

720
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,840
 They're lungs in a single breath.

721
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,840
 In a single breath.

722
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,800
 Humans, any change about a tenth in a single breath?

723
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,800
 Wow.

724
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,800
 Yeah.

725
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:19,000
 So what they do, though, is when they go to sleep, they go down and they effectively do a form

726
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,720
 of sleepwalking, but sleep-sleeping.

727
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:28,480
 Yeah, wait, sorry, sleep-sleeping, sleep-sleeping, where they come to the surface and they take in

728
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,520
 breath, but they're still asleep and then go back down.

729
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,520
 Wow.

730
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,520
 Yeah, it's just like a bit of sleep.

731
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,520
 Are they definitely still asleep?

732
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,520
 Yeah, because I can't tell.

733
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:40,920
 It's like a half-a-way, they say it's exactly, it's as close to, yeah.

734
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:44,600
 It's like if you know that you got up in the middle of the night to check the clock to see

735
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:48,120
 what time it was, or it was 4am, and then went back to sleep, but you can remember that.

736
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:52,200
 It's having a conscious memory, but sort of also being still asleep, kind of thing.

737
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,040
 Why don't you keep your clock just with the view of your bed so that you don't have to get

738
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,040
 up every time you need to sleep?

739
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,040
 Because my clock is my iPhone, so you've got to press the button to turn it on, to have a

740
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,040
 look.

741
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,040
 I see.

742
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,040
 Yeah.

743
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,040
 It's a bit more complicated.

744
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:06,320
 That must be so annoying, because they can only last about 20 minutes underwater max without

745
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,320
 going out for hours.

746
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,320
 Yeah, but it was constantly-

747
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,800
 Well, they nap all the time.

748
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,440
 They don't have a long period of sleep.

749
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,560
 They're not like eight hours in the evening.

750
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,440
 They just nap in small little doses all the time.

751
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,160
 They're pretty lazy, aren't they?

752
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,160
 Manatees.

753
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,160
 Yeah.

754
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,160
 I've seen them.

755
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,160
 I've seen them all close.

756
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,160
 Yeah.

757
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,160
 Oh, they look so cool.

758
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,160
 They are quite cool.

759
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:28,080
 I saw them in a sea center and also in the wild.

760
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,880
 And in a sea center, they all have scars on them.

761
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,160
 This was a few years ago from where boats have hit them.

762
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,280
 Yeah, probably 90% I think are scarred from the friend base.

763
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,280
 Wow.

764
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,760
 But they just kind of, they're like cows.

765
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,720
 That's because they're called sea cows sometimes, aren't they?

766
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:46,200
 And they just kind of go around the sea, just grazing, and then sleep in for a bit.

767
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,880
 What do you want them to do, build melt squirting robots?

768
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,880
 What?

769
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,320
 But they look like they're really fat, and like they've got loads of blubber to survive

770
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,320
 and call waters.

771
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,320
 And they haven't.

772
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:01,080
 It turns out they're all intestines because they're herbivores, so they have to eat loads

773
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,080
 and loads of plants.

774
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,080
 They eat about a tenth of their weight in plants every day.

775
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,080
 Yeah.

776
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,760
 And so they have to constantly be grazing and constantly be digesting, which is where they

777
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,280
 get all the methane for their flatulence fron.

778
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,280
 Ah.

779
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,800
 But the lack of blubber means they can't survive and call waters, so they have to migrate

780
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,440
 when it gets cold in winter.

781
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,320
 And sometimes they swim into the, you know, the warm water outlets of power plants and things

782
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,320
 like this.

783
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,320
 Yeah.

784
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,520
 Because you get hundreds of manatees in Florida just converging.

785
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:32,880
 In fact, did you see in 2015, they got, I think, 19 manatees got stuck in a pint and a drainage

786
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,480
 pipe in Florida because they obviously caught it.

787
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,840
 Did the first one go in, and then the next one tried to save him, and then they just

788
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,840
 fell in love.

789
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,760
 Can you imagine how annoying that was with the first one?

790
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,240
 Why wasn't he shouting back, going back up guys, I got this.

791
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,240
 Did they get out, okay?

792
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,840
 Yeah, they pulled it out, they were fine, they were big days.

793
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,840
 Okay.

794
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,840
 They had to go in and put them on stretchers.

795
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,840
 Really?

796
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,840
 Yeah.

797
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,840
 It's amazing seeing that they're gone.

798
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,840
 Yeah, they have the pipe open.

799
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,840
 Oh, okay, right.

800
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:03,000
 There's a manatee hotline that you can call in Florida to talk to manatees in your area.

801
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 Yeah.

802
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,720
 Well, there's, because obviously there's a lot of interesting rules that happen in

803
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,760
 Florida when manatees, the stuff about, you know, out of touch, a manatee, there was

804
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,760
 a case where a dad almost went to jail because there was a photo of him touching a manatee.

805
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,760
 That's illegal.

806
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,960
 Not, I don't mean disgusting touch, like literally touching a manatee.

807
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,960
 Yeah, I know.

808
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,960
 Okay, I don't think anyone was thinking.

809
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,080
 I thought your face suggested that's what I was saying.

810
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,080
 No, it wasn't at all.

811
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,080
 Okay.

812
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,440
 But thank you for clarifying that.

813
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:32,240
 But so one thing that they often get is phone calls from people saying that we've got

814
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:36,880
 huge problems, the manatees are in huge danger by the shore.

815
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:42,720
 And often what that is is that manatees actually mate very close just off the coast of Florida

816
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,720
 and they do it in mass groups.

817
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:49,360
 And it looks like there's a struggle going on like because the water is going crazy.

818
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:55,120
 So Nadia Gordon, she's a marine mammal biologist with the state agency in Florida and she says

819
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:59,080
 the call we usually get is there's a mum and a tea and all the babies are trying to save

820
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,080
 it.

821
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:03,760
 But then in actuality, the large female can have up to 20 something males trying to breed

822
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,360
 the one female.

823
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,360
 And that's what's going on.

824
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:09,200
 So it looks like they're in serious trouble and that's a lot of the phone calls.

825
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,200
 So that's what happens.

826
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,080
 You get all the males who are trying to mate with the female.

827
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:16,160
 The females in the middle and all the males are trying to get at her, but they don't have

828
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,680
 claws or horns or anything like that or arms or anything so they're just kind of bumping

829
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,680
 each other.

830
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:25,560
 So it's kind of like if you're in a nightclub and there was a load of men trying to get

831
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,960
 towards a woman, but they had their arms by their sides and they're kind of bumping

832
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,960
 each other.

833
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,960
 I don't know.

834
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,960
 It'd be a bit like that.

835
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,960
 That's the weirdest.

836
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:42,960
 But I can imagine it, I like that.

837
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:54,640
 I would go to that club, yeah, but what happens obviously is that the one who's best at

838
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:59,440
 barging people out of the way gets the girl, but then the other ones, what do they do?

839
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,880
 Well, actually, they tend to just try and mate with each other.

840
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,880
 They do that.

841
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,880
 Right.

842
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,680
 I'll see in a way, everyone wins.

843
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,680
 Well, in a way.

844
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,680
 In a way.

845
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,680
 Everyone else has come to join second there.

846
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,400
 So you can obviously, they were mistaken for a mermaid.

847
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:19,360
 We think in Columbus's journal, he said he'd seen a mermaid, what the look of the refrigerator

848
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,120
 is a mermaid and we think it's a man I see.

849
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:25,520
 And you can kind of see why they look, if you look into their eyes, there's something

850
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,120
 very human about their faces.

851
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,520
 Well, they don't have eyelashes.

852
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,520
 Exactly.

853
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:35,560
 And I muscles close in a circular motion like an aperture on a camera.

854
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,560
 Right.

855
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,920
 So there are some differences, obviously, with the human and the man.

856
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,640
 Or you've got really weird boyfriends.

857
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,920
 They have large, pendulous breasts.

858
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,920
 They do.

859
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,920
 There we go.

860
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,920
 That's where the name Manatee comes from.

861
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,760
 It's an old caribword, meaning breast.

862
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,760
 Oh, okay.

863
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:57,160
 And Columbus, when he saw them, he did say that they rose well out of the sea, but they're

864
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,400
 not so beautiful as they're said to be.

865
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,400
 No.

866
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,800
 Well, their faces had some masculine traits, and they had scars where they'd been hit by

867
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,800
 boats.

868
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,800
 Yeah.

869
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,800
 They had no eyelashes.

870
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,800
 Yeah.

871
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,840
 On the other hand, those breasts were very pendulous.

872
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,760
 They have been at sea for a long time.

873
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,760
 That's true.

874
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,760
 I guess so.

875
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,760
 Yeah.

876
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,760
 And they are terrible in bed.

877
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,760
 Okay.

878
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,760
 That's it.

879
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:25,760
 That's all of your facts.

880
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,200
 Thank you so much for listening.

881
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,160

 Also, you can go to our website.

893
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,360

00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,440
 You'll also find the link for our tour.

 There are tickets available now.

896
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,360
 We are doing a UK tour.

897
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,360
 Please come along.

898
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,360
 It's going to be really fun.

899
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,360
 We'll see you again next week with another episode.

900
