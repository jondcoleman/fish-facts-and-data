00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.760
 "Hi everybody. Welcome back to No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.360
 from the QI offices in Covent Garden. My name is Andrew Hunter Murray. I am sitting here

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.120
 with Anna Tijinski, James Harkin and Anne Miller. And once again, we have gathered around

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.680
 the microphones with our four favourite facts, not from the last seven days, from our new

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.120
 book. Oh my goodness, we've written a book. It's called One, Three, Four, Two, QI Facts

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.400
 to leave you flabbergasted and it is out now. To celebrate that and plug the book, we have

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.600
 each brought our favourite fact from the book. And starting in no particular order, we begin

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:58.600
 with James. Okay, my fact is that four-year-old mice are less common than 100-year-old humans.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:05.120
 Nice. Might as well do all 100-year-old humans are very posh, aren't they? So, I see.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.920
 It's a play on the word common. I don't know how you class a mouse though. What do you

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:21.920
 mean? Do they like Cheddar or Ementel or Yark? So yeah, this is just simply a fact that mice

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.880
 don't live very long. Yeah, it's unbelievable that they're so short-lived. It's not extraordinary.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.880
 They're tiny. That's interesting what you say, Andy, because you're equating smallness

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.280
 with lack of longevity. Do you think that's true in general? No, I guess because they're

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.360
 smallnesses. It was like tiny grades. Yeah, true. All right, I take it all back.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.120
 Parrots? They're quite small. They're bigger than a mouse as well.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.240
 They live a long time, Parrots. Oh, yeah. Yeah, there's one parrot called Charlie the Parrot

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.640
 who's owner claims he's 117 and used to belong to Winston Churchill. But what I like is

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.520
 if one's looked into this and so Mr. Oram who owns him now says his father-in-law sold

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.080
 him to Churchill in 1937 and then got him back when Churchill died and the Churchill family

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.000
 and all historians have questioned this and say they can't find any evidence that Churchill

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.280
 owned a parrot. And I would have just thought, like obviously we'd know if Churchill had

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.480
 a pet parrot, right? No, I don't think we would because. Do you remember there was that thing

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.560
 when Frobe's came out and they were banned from government offices because they could repeat

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.560
 things? So if he had a parrot, he would have to be illegal. Because he might repeat all

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.640
 the secrets. So you couldn't tell anyone that you had a parrot? Churchill had a secret parrot

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.920
 is what we're saying. This is the greatest conspiracy fact.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.580
 So the world's oldest mouse, which is an article about whom I found this fact is called

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:52.520
 Yoda and Yoda celebrated his fourth birthday on April 10th. Yeah, yeah, and he got to the

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.840
 age of four and this is the quote in a pathogen free rest home for geriatric mice. And he had

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.280
 a cage make called Princess Leia. And I said this, I mentioned this to Dan, who was sitting

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.920
 in the room and I was doing my research earlier. And Dan very dismissively said, they didn't

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:15.400
 even meet. So that Yoda, basically, if you're four years old as a mouse, that's the equivalence

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.600
 of 136 in human years. Wow. This is very old. Yeah. Well, it's older than any humans have

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:28.420
 been. Yeah. So well done mice. They've beaten us in a way. So, so we've definitely beaten them.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.040
 It's weird though, because they're doing a lot of experiments into how to make mice

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.480
 live longer in the hope that we can then make humans live longer the same way. And one

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.480
 thing it does work is calorie restricted diets that they just live longer when you give

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:45.160
 them less calories. But lots of mice in cages are fed a diet which is almost exclusively

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.960
 starch and sugar. It's like feeding someone donuts, basically, and expecting them to

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.440
 get to a ripe old age. Although they, I mean, when they eat in the wild, they live less

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.760
 long than when they eat in captivity. And they eat more than starch and sugar in the wild

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.000
 presumably. I guess the wild is less easy habitat to get to an old age in because it's,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.520
 you know, you're outdoors and you're exposed to the elements slightly less than a pathogen

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:10.040
 free rest home. Yeah. Yeah. There was a guy already a fall last week who was saying that

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.880
 domestic cats should all be euthanised and no one should be allowed them because they

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.840
 caused such devastation to the bird population. Yeah. Yeah. It's very, very angry. They kill

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.120
 lots of small animals. And I think I've heard that especially in Australia they're trying

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.240
 to, you know, get rid of cats. Yeah. I think they've destroyed something like 65 bird species

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.800
 in the last 50 years. Oh. There's quite a lot of species to have got rid of. Yeah. Yeah.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.680
 I was looking at a research lab called the Jackson Lab which I think this one was in Maine

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:45.440
 and they had mice who they said before and a half. I've opened that down there. There must

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.440
 be three and a half. If this is the oldest. But they, what they had mice who they said before

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.280
 and a half, which they said is over twice the life expectancy. And I quite like this quote.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.560
 So the researcher who's working with the most closely said the mice are two girls and

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.960
 she's become really, really attached to them. So she totally loves them now and she treats

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.200
 them really, really well. And she says we move them to a new cage and we take care when

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.960
 we pick them up to cup them in our hands, rather than pick them up by the tail with the four

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.280
 steps. It's the luxury mice. Yeah. It's a level of extreme care and attention they get.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.300
 My friend told me that because rabbits are natural prey, every time you pick up a rabbit

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.520
 it thinks it's about to be eaten. So it's really stressful for rabbits to be handled. It's

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.080
 way too big. It might really gently let go down to them. Otherwise you think you're picking

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.380
 up for a hug. It thinks. Yeah. That's why they're completely bastards when you pick

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.640
 them up. I don't suppose any animals really think when you pick them up they're going

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:38.080
 to get a hug. They should be consistently pleasantly surprised in that case.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:45.760
 And Robert, it's so ungrateful. Have you guys heard of the Black 6 C57 BL/6. Slash 6?

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:55.320
 Yeah. No. This is so cool. This is a particular kind of mouse which gets used in almost all experiments.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:01.400
 It's like the standard currency of mouse experiments. Five in six American research mice are

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.580
 there's one very particular strain. It was created in 1921 or a huge thing like there's a huge

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:12.200
 article on slate about them. Created in 1921 when a mouse codenamed C52 mounted one called

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:19.140
 C57 and deposited its semen in her reproductive tract with a waxy plug. That's a very sexy article

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:25.480
 you've been reading. And so basically almost all experiments in America are mice and most

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:31.960
 experiments on animals are done on mice. So it's most of most of them. And the problem is

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.000
 we think that they're kind of standard mice and they're treated as such in experiments.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.280
 But they're really unusual. They all think they're special. Well, no, they are special.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.840
 This is the interesting thing because they are susceptible to morphine addiction and they

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:51.760
 like alcohol. And that makes you special, does it? Normal mice, I'm afraid not. It doesn't

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:56.840
 make you special. But they're exceptional in their pain responses and other things like

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.720
 this. So actually there's no such thing as a perfect average mouse to experiment on.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:06.600
 That's really interesting because what you lose by having the mouse be it one kind you gain

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.400
 because all your experiments are controlled by the same kind of mice. Exactly. Yeah. That's

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:18.720
 true. And one thing it does, it does mouse barbering behavior. So cutting mice hair. Yeah.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:22.320
 This is where you have several different mice in the same cage. The dominant mouse will

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:29.200
 selectively remove hair from its cage mates to show that it's in charge. All the subordinate

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:34.360
 mice are going around with little bulb patches on them. Really? Wow, to mark them out as his

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:38.720
 slaves. Yeah. Actually speaking of my stress, you know mice are more stressed around men than

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.360
 around women and they've just discovered this and they think it's going to have to be controlled

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:46.480
 for in future experiments with mice. Do we know why? So we assume it's because they have

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:50.160
 a reaction to the testosterone. So they just have the same reaction as they do to male mice.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:54.360
 And a male is often going to be more bellicose I suppose. I've just made mice. I've just

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:58.120
 island feminists and they get really annoyed with the patriarchy. It could be that. They

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:03.200
 definitely release more of this stress hormone. So they put male researchers with mice and

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:07.440
 their bodies cause through with all these hormones that they don't have when they have they're

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.640
 with females. But yeah, it means in future when you're doing experiments, we need to control

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.400
 for that because their bodies are behaving completely differently depending on his working

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:17.240
 on them. Will we become more stressed when I approach them than when another woman approaches

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:21.840
 them? Yeah, I've noticed that. Does that make me a mouse? No, no, I've made you a researcher

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:28.680
 and then a mouse. Oh, it makes it work, does it? It's not just women there and is it? People,

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:32.880
 people who come stressed when I approach them. And mice actually. Did you see that they've

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:38.240
 made transparent mice? No. Yeah, I mean, no, you obviously wouldn't see that they've

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:41.200
 made transparent mice with you. Where have the transparent mice? Oh no, that's okay,

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:47.640
 they're still there. Go on, Andy, you can see a window. Can you? Can you? You can see a window

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.920
 frame. You can see where the window is. I'm looking at the window right now and I'm doubting.

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:55.600
 I know has these amazing eyes that can see the molecules in the glass. They can see reflections

00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:02.080
 and little bits of grime. Okay, these mice. They've got fingerprints all over them. Yes.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:05.920
 So scientists have made transparent mice and this is on something they do to mice after

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:10.400
 they've died is they inject chemicals into them and they pump these chemicals through

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.480
 their blood vessels, through their brain, through their spinal cords, through all their organs.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:18.560
 And it gets sort of he, me, H-E-M-E, which is the stuff in hemoglobin. And that's what gives

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:23.200
 a lot of the stuff in their body its color and other stuff that's big creating obstacles

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:28.240
 to the eyes. And it makes them completely transparent, but it means that we can study them

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.840
 much more easily because usually when you're studying dead mice as organs, let's say you've

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:36.840
 got a diabetic mouse and you want to work out how that works, then you'd have to cut

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:40.200
 the organs up and you could distort them. But in this way, you can just look at it from

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:44.520
 the outside and see everything inside it. Sure. It'd be more useful to have transparent

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:47.960
 living mice, I think. I know. I think they're working on that.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:52.280
 Yeah. Didn't you find a thing in QI about putting windows and cows?

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:56.280
 Yeah. So they put these windows and cow's stomachs, which means that you can, if a cow's

00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:00.560
 got a stomach infection, you can just insert whatever is needed to be inserted into the cow's

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:06.280
 stomach to make its infection better. That's very cool. Other old animals? Oh, yeah.

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:11.040
 Greenland sharks. Yeah. They're really old. They've recently found out that they might live

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:18.060
 up to around 400 years, maybe even older. What? They looked at some females, 28 female Greenland

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:24.320
 sharks. And they worked out that they, all this one, was somewhere between 272 years old

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:30.560
 and 512 years old. Wow. The Greenland shark, they didn't know until quite recently how long

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:34.120
 they actually lived. This is like, could be anywhere between like 20 and 400 years and no

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:40.120
 one years. Well, still it's anywhere between 272 and 512, which is quite a big discrabbit.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:47.000
 1744, that one would have been born at the least. The 2721? Yeah, if it was sharp.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.560
 It's a shame they couldn't have been born in a year where one of us had a useful historical

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:55.960
 reference to compare it to 1744. Anyone got anything? I'm not talking about my head.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:00.080
 So one of the King George's was on the throne. Great. Thanks, Andy. That's really

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:04.560
 a sport. Do you imagine that? Have you heard of Claire Hollingworth? Claire Hollingworth?

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:12.040
 No. No. I was on the list of Wikipedia centenarians basically. They have all these categories

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:15.800
 and they've got, you know, sports people and they've got artists and they've got scientists

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:20.960
 and they've also got a miscellaneous category. Absolutely. Yes, please. And Claire Hollingworth

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:28.520
 was the journalist who basically discovered the Second World War. She was 27. How did

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:34.400
 you discover the Second World War? Well, she broke the story in Britain, basically.

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:39.040
 And when I say that, she was 27, she was a brand new journalist, as in she had just met

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:42.400
 the editor of the telegraph and said, why aren't you hire me and why aren't you send me

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:47.840
 to Poland? So he wrote, learnt it and sent it to Poland. And a few days into her trip,

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:51.400
 she was returning to Poland after a cross-border trip into Germany. And she noticed all

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:56.080
 the way along the road, there were these big screens of Hessian up alongside the road

00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:01.080
 and the wind blew one of them up and it revealed loads of German tanks.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:08.640
 No way. Did Germany invade Poland by the load of screens? And then the wind blew and they're

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:12.880
 like, oh, dumb. It's very scary. I've got to win with that. It's very Scooby-Doo, isn't it?

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:18.400
 This is what happened. No, it is. It is. This was from the Guardian. I trust the Guardian.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:23.640
 Has anyone checked whether Germany's invaded anywhere else recently? Look for the Hessian

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:27.640
 screens. Wait, how, I have no idea how that's related to what we're talking about.

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:34.640
 Centenarians. She lived to 100. Sorry. She's more common than a four-year-old mouse. Nice.

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:40.640
 Yeah, Centenarians. So I was looking up some things about aging and how we can age better.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:43.400
 And so, you know, people always go and look at villages in town, sort of full of really

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:47.400
 really old people. And so the latest is a report in NPR which looked at the village of

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:52.520
 Akia Ruli in Italy. And it has 300 people in it who are over 100, which is a third of

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:57.600
 the population of that village. And so a doctor went there and did a little study and

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:01.080
 noted that there were two dietary habits. And I basically mentioned this so people can

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:06.840
 take it on board and imitate it. He said that everyone ate anchovies at every meal and

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:11.200
 they had rosemary with everything. And that's the key. That's the secret.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.840
 Oh, that's weird, isn't it? Because I wouldn't have personally just wouldn't put those

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:20.080
 two things together. Every meal. They're having every meal anchovies and rosemary.

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:26.360
 Look, they're not enjoying the taste, James. But that's a bit of advice. I looked at these

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:29.440
 tips too and they're brilliant because they always contradict each other. And there's one

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:35.080
 where if you sleep for fewer than six hours a night, you're four times a lot late to die.

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:39.760
 But if you sleep for more seven to eight hours, 30% higher chance of death, which means you

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:43.480
 sleep for basically exactly six hours according to these studies, or you're going to die.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.480
 I mean, you're going to die anyway.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.320
 Before you're going to die anyway, is the problem?

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:47.320
 I'm not.

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:50.920
 I don't know about you guys. Since someone's worrying, it's said that for every hour of TV you watch

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:55.000
 after the age 25, you knock off 22 minutes off your life expectancy.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.520
 What if you're watching an hour long documentary on how to extend your life?

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:01.280
 It's called a Paradox.

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:05.720
 I would do that for quite a lot of TV shows. I would take that ahead.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:06.880
 What about Gogglebox?

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:11.080
 Absolutely. Gogglebox is the best one to watch because you get lots of TV in one show.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:15.320
 I was going to say, what if, if you're watching someone watching TV, is that a 45 minutes

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.560
 show? Double penalties.

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:20.920
 Some more centenarians just going back to what Andy was saying before.

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:24.160
 My incredibly relevant story about Claire Hollingworth.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.880
 Isn't that cool? That's what we discussed.

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:26.880
 Anyway, sorry, go on.

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:31.560
 Emma Marano, on Marano, is the oldest person in the world at the moment.

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:36.160
 She is the only person born in the 19th century who's still alive.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:41.200
 She's the oldest Italian, as well as the oldest of everyone.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:43.360
 Whatever you'd say is she's Italian.

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:46.320
 And she's the oldest from a tiny Italian village.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.640
 What a coincidence.

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:53.600
 She credits her long life to her diet of raw eggs and being single.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:58.160
 I think what she means is she credits being single to her diet of raw eggs.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:04.640
 The oldest man is a guy called Israel Kristal and he's 45 years older than the state of Israel.

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:05.640
 Wow.

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:06.640
 That's good.

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:07.640
 Great.

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:08.640
 Good work, yeah.

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:09.640
 So it was named after him.

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:10.640
 No, no.

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:13.600
 It was very careful.

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.720
 It was named after him.

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:24.960
 Okay, it's time for fact number two and that is Anna.

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:29.560
 My fact this week is that the detective agency that hunted butch Cassidy also worked for

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:30.560
 Coca-Cola.

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:35.600
 Yeah, I just really love this overlapping of its two roles.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:40.120
 So this is a detective agency called the Pinkerton Detective Agency and it was a very

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.720
 big deal in the 19th century.

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:45.760
 It was a bunch of detectives were hired to hunt down all the all the greats of the Wild West.

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:51.600
 So they hunted butch in the Sundance Kid, they hunted Jesse James for years and also they

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:58.800
 were employed in 1916 by this guy called Harold Hirsch who wanted to spy on other companies

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:02.680
 and make sure they weren't stealing Coca-Cola's trademark because he was running Coca-Cola

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:03.680
 at the time.

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:06.920
 And yeah, he sent them undercover to soda fountains.

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:10.200
 He's almost as dangerous as going after bootcasts.

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:14.000
 Can you imagine that career step after being in a shootout with the Sundance Kid.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.400
 I'm going to send you to a soda fountain undercover to collect samples of Coca and check.

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:20.400
 Really?

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:22.400
 There were a lot of limitations.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.600
 I found a list of all the companies that they went after for using their name.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:26.600
 Okay.

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:27.600
 You want to hear something?

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:28.600
 Yeah.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:29.600
 Some of them are very close.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:34.120
 So they were after a candy-cola, celery-cola, Coca-Cola, or with K's.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:39.200
 Coca-Cola Coke with a see-then-a-k, Coca and Coca-Cola hyphenated, Coca-Rica, yes, it's

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.720
 a Coca-Cola and Coca-Cola.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:45.400
 Coca-Cola all with K's is especially egregious, that's outrageous.

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:50.520
 I saw Coke, K, O, K, E, and they also went after a company called Dope.

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:51.520
 Dope?

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:52.520
 Yeah.

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:53.520
 Dope and Coke.

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:54.520
 Yeah.

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:58.320
 They were made by the same manufacturer who had actually been a partner of the guy who went

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:01.040
 on to set up Coca-Cola, but yeah, they called it Dope.

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:06.280
 So the Coca-Cola company sort of begs people that it's advertising, not to refer to their

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:10.520
 drink as Coke, because that made it much easier to copy because so many drinks are called Coke.

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:14.000
 But people still did call it Coke, as we do, but equally they called it Dope.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.720
 So you'd say you can have a cup of Dope, and that was obviously a reference to its former

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:18.720
 cocaine content.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:21.360
 So people knew it as the drink that had the drugs in it.

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:23.200
 It didn't have actual cocaine in it, did it?

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:26.080
 It had the, is it, the Coca-Leaves, or it had...

00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:30.240
 Yeah, it had, I think it had basically cocaine in it.

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:34.760
 What was interesting was that when it was taken out of Coca-Cola, at the very, at the

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:38.720
 sort of turn of the century, they still, in the advertising implied that it contained cocaine

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.640
 because they still wanted people to think they were going to get that kick.

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:45.480
 And so they used to get in trouble, and there was a lawsuit filed against them for implying

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:48.280
 that they drink contained cocaine when outrageously it didn't.

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:49.280
 That's fantastic.

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:52.280
 Should we, should we also say who Butch Cassidy was?

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.280
 Oh, yeah.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:57.000
 Oh, yeah, so Butch Cassidy, for those of you who haven't seen one of the greatest films

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.200
 they've made, was a Wild West outlaw in the 1800s.

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.600
 And he conducted various train robberies.

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.280
 He was hunted by this pink to an agency.

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:09.440
 So in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid, it's these detectives who are always on their

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:10.440
 tail.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:14.440
 And eventually they drove them out of America, and they ended up in Bolivia.

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:17.000
 And then there's lots of theories about what happened to them.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.680
 So it's assumed they were killed in a shootout in Bolivia, and that's how the film ends, certainly.

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:25.200
 Or actually, you don't see them dying the film, do you?

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.640
 Boyle of very much a legend.

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:27.640
 Sorry.

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:30.640
 Sorry, that is true.

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:31.640
 But yeah, there are lots of theories.

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:38.480
 There apparently there was a guy called William T. Phillips, who surfaced in America in 1908

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:39.480
 or 1909.

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:43.720
 And he was recognized by a bunch of people, a bunch of policemen who chased Butch in the

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:46.280
 olden days, and his ex-girlfriend.

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:50.680
 And this guy's adopted son says it had always been accepted in the family that he'd been

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:51.680
 Butch Cassidy.

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:56.600
 And he even wrote this manuscript in 1934, William T. Phillips saying, this is what happened

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.600
 to Butch Cassidy without saying, oh, that's who I am.

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:02.920
 But saying Butch Cassidy got away at the shootout, the Sundance kid was killed.

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:03.920
 And so--

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:06.760
 And there's little details that he threw in as well, it was really detailed.

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:07.760
 Yes.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:08.760
 Photography.

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:09.760
 Yeah.

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:10.760
 And he didn't die till 1934.

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:11.760
 So--

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:17.160
 So one of the former president of Bolivia, René Berrientos, he actually investigated the

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:20.480
 idea that Butch and Sundance had been killed in a shootout outside of Bolivian

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:21.480
 bank.

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:25.920
 He interviewed villagers personally who had been, you know, witnesses or nearly witnesses.

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:27.600
 And he checked out army files.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:30.000
 And I've got in mind those that he dug up bodies.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.200
 I think actually he had bodies dug up.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:36.360
 But he eventually concluded that the shootout story was a fabrication.

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:37.360
 Did he?

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:38.360
 Yeah.

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:42.960
 Although there is a town in Bolivia that says this is the resting place, or here lie Butch Cassidy

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:43.960
 in the Sundance kid, don't they?

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.960
 I think it's called San Vicente.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:46.960
 Oh really?

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:47.960
 You would do for the tourism wouldn't you?

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:52.000
 You wouldn't say, butch and Sundance got away from this place.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 That's true.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.920
 Did you know that the movie was originally called The Sundance Kid and Butch Cassidy?

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:56.920
 That's it.

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:57.920
 No way.

00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:58.920
 Wow.

00:19:58.920 --> 00:19:59.920
 That's not a worst ever name for a film.

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:01.920
 It feels like that's what is now, doesn't it?

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:02.920
 Yeah.

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:03.920
 Well, never know if it would have felt absolutely normal.

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:04.920
 Yeah.

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:06.920
 Because Paul Newman was going to play Sundance.

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:07.920
 That's right.

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:08.920
 That's right.

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:09.920
 But then they needed to switch that over for some reason.

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:13.920
 And then they had a thing where oddly Robert Revford, who wasn't as big a star, was

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:17.520
 then going to be playing Sundance as Sundance was going to be first in the name of the film.

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:20.480
 So then they said, well, we have to switch the name of the film as well now.

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.480
 Doesn't make any sense.

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.480
 Sundance was the protégé.

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:27.520
 It would have been totally ridiculous and not in accordance with the real history of the

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:28.520
 thing.

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:29.520
 All right.

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:30.520
 Okay.

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:35.480
 But yeah, I think I said in a, might have said before that he had a Lancasterian accent.

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:36.480
 Was it this movie?

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.480
 This movie.

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:42.480
 Well, his father and mother both came from the North of England and didn't move to America

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:43.480
 till quite late on in life.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:44.480
 That sounds great.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:45.480
 Oh, yeah.

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:46.480
 Suddenly a one over.

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:47.480
 Yeah.

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:51.440
 Well, you know, people always say that I sound like a real butch world west.

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:52.440
 Yeah.

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:53.440
 And you really remind me of Paul Newman.

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:54.440
 So, yeah.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:57.200
 I don't know what he looks like, but I can only imagine.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:00.240
 Oh, I mean, he's the most attractive man ever.

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.240
 Born.

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:04.760
 I can see where you're coming from now.

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:05.760
 The Pinkerton detectives then.

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.160
 Do you guys have stuff on that?

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:08.160
 Um.

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.160
 And their motto.

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:10.160
 Okay.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.160
 What was their motto?

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:12.160
 We never sleep.

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.160
 We never sleep.

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.160
 And also we're chronically exhausted.

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:15.160
 Yeah.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:19.680
 I read in one place that their logo was a large black and white eye, and that's supposedly

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.560
 where the phrase "private eye" comes from.

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:22.560
 Yeah.

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:23.560
 Oh.

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:24.560
 Yeah.

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:25.560
 Oh, that's true.

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:26.560
 Do you know who Pinkerton was?

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:27.560
 He was a barrel maker.

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:28.560
 He was from Scotland.

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:29.560
 Yeah.

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:30.560
 And living near Chicago.

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:31.560
 Oh, I like him already.

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:35.480
 And one night he went to the woods to get more wood for staves to make into barrels.

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:39.640
 And he found the remains of a campsite and he got suspicious and he went back the following

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:40.640
 night.

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.720
 And he found a group of counterfeiters making coins.

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.880
 And he got the gang arrest and everyone said, "Oh, great job, Pinkerton.

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:48.160
 You should investigate more of these counterfeit cases."

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.160
 And so he did.

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:52.760
 He just started investigating things and then set up this enormous country-wide agency.

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:56.720
 So he had a Scottish accent and Custley had a Lancasterian accent.

00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:00.160
 So if they ever do an audio play of this, then Anne and I could play the two.

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.160
 Yeah.

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:08.160
 And I think there are agents already if anyone's ringing off the hook next door.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.840
 But I think they were seen as a threat to Pinkerton's by the end of the 19th century

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:17.200
 and in fact were forced to disband because they were so big and the government law enforcement

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.080
 didn't like that they were posing this threat.

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:23.440
 So they were larger than the US military by the 1890s.

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:26.640
 So they were larger than the US military by the 1890s.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:31.120
 They had 2,000 people full-time on their books and they had 30,000 reserves, which is more

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.120
 men than in a standing army.

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.120
 For a detective work.

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:35.120
 I know.

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:36.120
 Yeah.

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:37.120
 That's amazing.

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:38.120
 It is amazing.

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:39.120
 They were all reserves, of course.

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:40.120
 So I don't know if they could have called them all up full-time.

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:41.120
 No.

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:44.240
 I think they all had normal jobs probably most of the time and then sort of spied on people

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:45.240
 as a hobby at weekend.

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.240
 I'm a Pinkerton.

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.360
 There's 30 of you with notebooks.

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:49.360
 Yeah.

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:51.160
 Do you know what Pepsi was originally called?

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:52.160
 What?

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:53.160
 Brad's Drink.

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:56.240
 Was it just for Brad?

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:57.240
 It was just for Brad.

00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:02.440
 It was Caleb Bradham, who was the inventor and it was named, it was like Coca-Cola, but

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:03.600
 it didn't have any Coca-Cola in it.

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:06.960
 So I think they were casting around desperately for another name.

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:11.440
 It's interesting that Coca-Cola, these days you could buy a bottle with the word Brad on

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:12.440
 it.

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:14.200
 That must really sting to Pepsi.

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:15.200
 Yeah.

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.200
 That's a good point.

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.200
 If you're out.

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:21.280
 Freud said it cured his depression and made him more sexually active.

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.280
 Coca-Cola.

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:23.280
 Coca-Cola.

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:24.280
 Coca-Cola.

00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:25.280
 Really?

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:26.280
 Yeah.

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:27.280
 They would say, what would you like to drink in a go?

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:28.280
 Coke.

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:29.280
 Coke.

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:30.280
 Okay.

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:36.880
 It's time for fact number three, which is my fact.

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:42.720
 Which is that you cannot get to the highest point of Mauritania with a compass.

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:43.720
 Right.

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:44.720
 Well, you can't get to it.

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:45.720
 You can't take a compass with you.

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:50.720
 But you can't use a compass to navigate to it, even if you have a map and the opposition.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:56.600
 Because it's completely made of magnetite with the mountain, which is a natural magnet and

00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:58.960
 as a result, it'll send your compass completely haywire.

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:03.040
 Well, you would think, actually, that no matter where you were in the world, if you were

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:07.320
 close enough, it would point you towards this massive mountain, so actually, it would work

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:08.320
 really well.

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:09.320
 It wouldn't get you to the top, would it?

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:11.400
 Because it would just point directly down at the mountain once you got it.

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:12.800
 So it would get you to the base of the mountain.

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:13.800
 That's a really good point.

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:16.800
 But it would be perfect for getting you to the base of the mountain, but then it's useless.

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:22.280
 But I read this amazing article this week, I think it's on crack, about life saving tips

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:23.280
 and things that you should know.

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:26.280
 And they said that if you get caught in an avalanche, everything is white, so you could

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:27.280
 be cooked on the witch way down.

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:28.280
 Which way is down?

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:30.280
 What you should do is you should clear some space around your mouth and spit.

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:33.520
 And whichever way you spit falls, you do, which is down, so you go down the way.

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:37.440
 Do you really think you wouldn't know which way was down, because you still have gravity?

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:39.240
 You're still going to be light headed.

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:40.480
 I sometimes get that in bed.

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:41.480
 Do you?

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:42.480
 Do you spell your face?

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:45.800
 You know the thing where you're like about a momentarily, you don't know which way you're

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:46.800
 facing.

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:47.800
 Sure.

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:48.800
 But that's not really the same.

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:52.720
 The one way you can't breathe, that's your facing into the pillow, Andy.

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:54.920
 This mountain, just to say, is blue, isn't it?

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:55.920
 Yeah.

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:56.920
 Which is quite cool.

00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:57.920
 So you could definitely find it without a com.

00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:58.920
 I think it's the magnetite that makes it blue.

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:01.840
 So from above, you can identify it.

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:08.520
 And there's this other amazing thing in Mauritania, which is 25 kilometres wide, but we didn't

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:12.200
 know it existed until we had the ability to fly.

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.360
 This is the thing called the Eye of the Sahara.

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:16.200
 And it was hidden for many, many millennia.

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:19.760
 It's this beautiful swirling rock formation.

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.960
 It's these blue rocks, and it looks like a big bullseye.

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:25.800
 But no one noticed it was there until, I think it was when we went to space, or maybe

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:30.120
 when someone was flying over it, but from space they say it becomes particularly striking,

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:33.400
 because it's in the middle of the Sahara, so there's nothing all around in this huge

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:34.400
 Bruce world.

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:37.440
 Gemini for in 1965 was when they discovered it.

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:38.440
 Was it?

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:39.440
 Yeah.

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:40.440
 And we have no idea what it is, do we?

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:42.520
 They thought it was from an asteroid, but now they don't think so.

00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:46.880
 And now they're saying they think it's seismic activity, pushing this dome up.

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:48.640
 But why is it a circle?

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:49.640
 They have no idea.

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.440
 Yeah, some kind of uplift.

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:54.520
 It does happen fairly often, but not very often in a circular way.

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:55.520
 Yeah.

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:58.160
 It's basically like art attack when you'd be doing the big one and you wouldn't know what

00:25:58.160 --> 00:25:59.160
 it was.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:02.560
 And they pan out at the end, and you see it, and that's what they basically this is like.

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:03.560
 Yeah, that was great.

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:04.560
 Yeah.

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:05.560
 It's bloody loved that.

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:06.880
 Mauritania is an interesting country.

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:08.960
 It's 90% Sahara desert.

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:11.600
 It's only got 3.5 million people.

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:16.240
 And yet they have found the time to have 11 coos or attempted coos since 1960.

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:17.240
 11 coos?

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:18.240
 That's a lot.

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:19.240
 Yeah.

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:20.240
 It's a good solid number.

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.360
 And also they still have loads of slavery.

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:24.160
 The most coos is Bolivia, isn't it?

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:25.160
 I think.

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:26.160
 They've had loads.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:30.160
 They've had something like 191 in the 190 year history.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:33.080
 They've certainly had one more coo than they've had years.

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:34.080
 Yeah.

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.240
 Well, that'll be the cocaine.

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:40.760
 And there was a really weird incident, and did you see this, 2012 in Mauritania, where

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:43.080
 the president was shot.

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:45.920
 And then they said, "Oh, the president's been shot by accident.

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:46.920
 It's fine.

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:49.400
 It was a mistake, and just a bit of a mix up.

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:50.400
 And it's all fine now."

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:53.920
 And that may have been a, you know, an aborted coo or something like that.

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:54.920
 Really?

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:55.920
 Yeah.

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:57.640
 Some things on highest points.

00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:58.640
 Oh, yeah.

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:03.000
 There's a list of highest points of countries on Wikipedia.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.840
 Murray Hill is the highest point of Christmas Island.

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:06.840
 Oh.

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:07.840
 It was a nice fact.

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:08.840
 Oh, I'm absolutely chuffed.

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:15.760
 Do you think there are many tennis fans who have accidentally booked a trip to Murray Hill?

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:21.540
 The highest point of the French Polynesian Island territory of Wallace and Futuna is called

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:22.540
 Mount Puke.

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:23.540
 Oh, yeah.

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:24.540
 Yeah.

00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:26.740
 P-U-K-E, but it's pronounced poo-k.

00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:30.820
 Wallace and Futuna is one of the quietest places in the world.

00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:31.820
 It is so quiet.

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:32.820
 You've been there.

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:33.820
 You've been there.

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:34.820
 No, I haven't.

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:35.820
 But James and I did a thing.

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:36.820
 We were researching loads and loads of countries.

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:39.860
 And James started at the beginning of the alphabet and I started at the end.

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:44.020
 And let's just say, the afternoon, I spent researching Wallace and Futuna was pretty slow.

00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:46.460
 Did you find the Mount Puke thing?

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:47.460
 I think I did.

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:48.460
 Yeah.

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:49.460
 I think there's not much else.

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:50.740
 I mean, there are about two things on there.

00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:54.420
 And one of them is a place called Mount Puke is quite hard even for a search of my limited

00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:55.420
 ability to find it.

00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:56.420
 Is it even a volcano?

00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:57.660
 Because that might make sense.

00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:00.980
 Is it puking again?

00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:04.460
 It comes from the Polynesian word poo-k, which means mound.

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:05.460
 I see.

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:09.580
 And poo-k, poo-k means like an uneven surface or something with lots of mounds.

00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:10.580
 So does it mean mound?

00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:11.580
 Mound mound.

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:12.580
 Mound mound.

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:13.580
 Yeah.

00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:15.660
 Do you think they get annoyed with having to explain to every single British lad tourist

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:17.420
 who comes that it's pronounced poo-k?

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:20.820
 There are no British lad tourists of Wallace and Futuna.

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:23.340
 Actually, I'm just looking up Wallace and Futuna now.

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:26.380
 I'm just going to see what gems I can find.

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:30.660
 No one has opened this file since the 25th of October 2011.

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:31.660
 This is very exciting.

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:33.180
 This is like ancient history, a few I saw.

00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:34.180
 A little time capsule.

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:35.180
 Yeah.

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:37.180
 Do you want to know the mountain fact from the book while you're looking at it?

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:38.180
 Sure.

00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:40.180
 So the highest point of Canada was only determined in 1992.

00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:41.180
 Really?

00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:42.180
 Yeah.

00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:43.180
 Really?

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:44.180
 Yeah, I won't show before then.

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:49.100
 When Edmund Hillary got to the top of Everest, he celebrated by having a wee.

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:51.300
 That's how I usually celebrate.

00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:54.620
 Actually, you've been celebrating a bit much around the office recently, and to be honest.

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:55.620
 It's true.

00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:56.620
 It was my birthday yesterday.

00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:57.620
 I thought you'd appreciate it.

00:28:57.620 --> 00:29:01.900
 I left it on your desk and everything.

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:04.460
 Can we see what else is in that Wallace and Futuna?

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:07.860
 Guys, it's pretty thin groove.

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:08.860
 Population.

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:13.620
 Population is 15,400, which is about a tenth that of Swindon.

00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:14.620
 That's good.

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:15.620
 That's okay.

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:16.620
 Okay.

00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:22.620
 It was the only French colony to side with the Vischy collaborationist government during

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:23.620
 the Second World War.

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:24.620
 Yeah.

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:30.700
 And that lasted until a regiment of US Marines arrived in 1942 and said cannibalism was banned

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:31.700
 there in 1830.

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:32.700
 Oh.

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:34.700
 Oh, that's quite ahead of its time.

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:35.700
 Yeah.

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:36.700
 For cannibalism.

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:37.700
 No, it's not.

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:38.700
 In Polynesia.

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:41.500
 Cannibalism is still technically not illegal in the UK.

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:42.500
 You're right.

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:44.140
 There's not a specific law.

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:45.820
 Basically, they'll do you for something.

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:46.820
 Yeah.

00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:47.820
 But not that.

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:51.700
 So you could be done for desecrating grave or a corpse or a movement of evidence.

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:52.700
 Yeah.

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:55.620
 There's a lot of things you can get done for, but specifically cannibalism is not illegal

00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:58.060
 in the UK, but it is illegal in Wallace and Futuna.

00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:00.340
 It has been for a hundred and a half years.

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:04.580
 Actually, Mauritania was the last country in the world to abolish slavery, which it did

00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:05.580
 in 2007.

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:06.580
 2007.

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:10.460
 Yeah, and it didn't make it a crime until 2012.

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:11.460
 Wow.

00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:14.580
 But the thing is, I've read reports saying that it still happens a lot.

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:15.580
 Yeah.

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:16.580
 It's four years out.

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:17.580
 It's not long to change.

00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:19.180
 This is, I mean, such rough estimates.

00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:23.220
 Between 4% and 20% of the population are still enslaved.

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:24.220
 So what?

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:30.980
 Although, in the interest of balance, I think the Mauritonian government has denied that

00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:32.980
 has said that foreign reports of it are exaggerated.

00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:35.340
 Should we talk a bit about magnets for legal safety?

00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:36.340
 Yeah.

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:37.340
 Yes, magnet.

00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:41.700
 So here, line up from north to south even when fleeing, do they?

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:44.780
 Even if that involves fleeing straight into the hands of the person that are running away

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:45.780
 for help.

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:49.220
 No, actually, it might make sense because it keeps the herd of animals together.

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:53.540
 Unless, of course, they run in different directions.

00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:56.580
 You wouldn't bump into anyone because you're all going parallel to one of them.

00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:57.580
 Exactly.

00:30:57.580 --> 00:30:58.580
 Yeah.

00:30:58.580 --> 00:30:59.580
 I've always went to study this with dogs.

00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:03.060
 You know, when they said that dogs poo and line with the earth, magnetic field or something.

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:06.540
 And I know people have done studies, but I'm actually going to go to Richmond Park this

00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:11.180
 week and I don't have much on and see if this is actually true because it so doesn't feel

00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:12.180
 like it's true.

00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:14.180
 You're going to go and chase deer and see if they run or--

00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:15.180
 I sure am.

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:16.180
 Yeah.

00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:23.860
 Okay, it's time for the final effect and that is end.

00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:28.340
 My fact is that in 2015, a plane had to make an emergency landing after the smoke alarm

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:30.020
 was triggered by farting sheep.

00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:31.020
 Amazing.

00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:36.100
 It was over 2000 sheep in the cargo hold and the alarms went off.

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:40.820
 It appears to be the methane emitted by the sheep figured the alarm could not believe that

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:45.020
 you can transport 2000 sheep on a plane like a sheep.

00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:46.020
 That is a lot of sheep.

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:47.020
 Well, I guess they kind of--

00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:49.020
 Well, they don't demand the same leg room.

00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:55.940
 Well, the world record for people on a flight is 1888 and two of those were born on during

00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:56.940
 the flight.

00:31:56.940 --> 00:32:00.020
 Was that an air lift out of Israel or something?

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:01.020
 Yeah.

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:02.020
 Wasn't it out of Africa or into Israel?

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:03.020
 You're right.

00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:04.020
 It was.

00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:05.020
 Out of Ethiopia and into Israel.

00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:06.020
 In 1991.

00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:07.020
 Yeah.

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:10.900
 It was a Jewish community who were at a risk of a war or something in Israel or from an air

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:11.900
 lift.

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:12.900
 That's right.

00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:14.300
 But yeah, it's incredible this fact.

00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:18.100
 This happened again in November last year with goats on a different plane.

00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:19.100
 What?

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:20.100
 That's so weird.

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:24.460
 It's happened again in 2014 with cows on a different plane.

00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:28.100
 Guess what the headline in the Sun article was about the farting goats on the plane.

00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:29.100
 Goats on a plane.

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:30.900
 Not bad.

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:31.900
 It's about farting.

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:32.900
 Specifically farting.

00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:33.900
 Oh, gas.

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:34.900
 Gas.

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:36.820
 It's almost famous goat.

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:39.340
 It's Billy goat gas.

00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:40.340
 Billy goat.

00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:41.340
 Goat.

00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:42.340
 Goat.

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:44.340
 That's better than Billy goat gas.

00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:45.980
 Billy goat goat was the sun headline.

00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:46.980
 Great.

00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:50.620
 Yes, it does seem to be weirdly common.

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:52.420
 They need to get better alarms, I think.

00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:55.420
 I suppose if the alarm goes off, you better not be like, oh, it's probably the fart and then

00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:56.420
 your plane goes down.

00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:58.620
 It's better to land than be like, oh, we're okay.

00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:00.140
 But sir, there are no sheep on board.

00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:01.140
 It's fine.

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:03.140
 It's always the fine animals.

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:06.820
 In 2014, it was the fire alarm, not the smoker alarm, and I think it was caused by the cows

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:07.820
 overheating.

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:08.820
 Wow.

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:09.820
 Oh, no, the heat sensor.

00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:10.820
 Yeah, exactly.

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:13.300
 And they thought it was a fire and they landed in case it was.

00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:18.460
 In 2012, a plane had to make a landing after a call broke out of someone's hand luggage.

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:19.460
 Oh, there we are.

00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:20.460
 Yeah.

00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:22.820
 And it bit its owner and escaped and they were like, oh, I'm fine, I'm fine.

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:24.820
 They're like, you need to go off the plane now.

00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:29.900
 If someone didn't quote Samuel Jackson at that moment, that is the greatest travesty

00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:30.900
 ever known to man.

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:31.900
 Okay.

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:32.900
 What about maggots on a plane?

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:33.900
 Do you see that?

00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:35.500
 There's sort of mini snakes.

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:36.500
 Go on.

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:41.860
 This was a US Airways flight at Lanter Airport.

00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:46.020
 It wasn't allowed to take off, actually, because maggots started falling out of the overhead

00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:47.020
 compartments.

00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:48.020
 Oh, my god.

00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:49.020
 Oh, my god.

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:54.220
 Someone had left a container of old meat and it caused a delay.

00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:57.060
 This was a flight to Charlotte.

00:33:57.060 --> 00:34:01.500
 And someone said that there was only one maggot landed on that, but she felt like they were

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:05.860
 crawling all over me because it only takes one maggot to upset your world.

00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:08.140
 I don't think it's fair.

00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:13.300
 And as they're telling us to stay calm and seated, I see a maggot looking back at me and

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:19.180
 I'm thinking, these are anaerobic Fleshy Tiglavi that the flight attendants don't have

00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:20.180
 to sit with.

00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:23.660
 But I like that thought that they're anaerobic.

00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:24.660
 Yeah.

00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:25.660
 Yeah.

00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:26.660
 Was she a chemist?

00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:27.660
 I don't know.

00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:29.660
 I think these are bloody maggots.

00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:30.660
 Get me off.

00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:31.660
 They're moving my seat.

00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:33.620
 They're just fly larvae, though.

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:34.620
 Not just.

00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:35.620
 They are anaerobic fly larvae.

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:36.620
 Oh, that's a very good point.

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:37.620
 I hadn't considered that.

00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:38.620
 All right.

00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:43.140
 There was a flight got rounded for human flatulence in 2006 after a lady was farting on

00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:48.260
 a plane, but she was a bit embarrassed and to get rid of the smell, she lit a match.

00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:50.740
 She really shouldn't do on planes.

00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:52.740
 In the blue compartment, can't you?

00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:53.740
 No.

00:34:53.740 --> 00:34:54.740
 They're very clear.

00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:56.740
 You're not allowed to light anything in the blue.

00:34:56.740 --> 00:34:57.740
 I've got smoke sensors.

00:34:57.740 --> 00:34:58.740
 I know.

00:34:58.740 --> 00:34:59.740
 But that's to stop people smoking cigarettes, isn't it?

00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:02.500
 Yeah, you're not supposed to be lighting matches in a pressurised environment.

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:04.500
 I think people smell sulfur.

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:08.620
 I've been getting away with it for years and years, and I always have a joystick on a plane

00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:11.180
 to calm myself down.

00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:17.740
 Well, here's a headline from March 2015, "BA flight forced to land early because of

00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:18.740
 smelly poo."

00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:24.220
 Well, the flight to Dubai from Heathrow, and one passenger said, "We knew something was

00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:25.220
 a bit odd.

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:28.300
 About ten minutes later, the pilot said, 'You may have noticed there's quite a pundit

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:30.620
 smell coming from one of the toilets.'

00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:33.100
 He said it was liquid, fecal, excrement.

00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:34.100
 Those are the words he used."

00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:39.180
 He said, "I'm coming from the passenger and I'm in profile."

00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:43.300
 But the plane was in the air for 30 minutes, and then got turned around, had to go back to

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:48.260
 Heathrow, because apparently it was a risk because they only recycle half the air, and

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:49.660
 this was so smelly, apparently.

00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:54.380
 It was 15 hours until the next flight left, and they had to all stay overnight.

00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:56.940
 It wasn't like they had to wait that long for the smell to go.

00:35:56.940 --> 00:35:59.700
 I think I'd leave it for 15 hours.

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:01.700
 I think they destroyed the plane in the end.

00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:02.700
 That's very good.

00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:09.060
 I was on the plane recently, and I was chatting to the ex and he was asked, because it was

00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:14.060
 quite late, and I ordered a toasting, and I saw how'd you this hand signal to the person

00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:16.900
 at the other end of the plane, like a crocodile, and I said, "Oh, what's that?"

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:20.700
 And she said, "It's because one person's at the front doing the food and one's taking

00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:23.540
 the orders down the plane, and rather than yelling, they have hand signals."

00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:27.540
 So toasty is a crocodile, because it's like a crock of a show in France.

00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:31.700
 A smiley face, holding your hand and make a smile, is this cheese sandwich, cheesy, great.

00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:32.700
 Oh, no.

00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:35.100
 Sapping your shoulder is chips, because chip on the shoulder.

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:36.100
 Right.

00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:37.100
 Even a whole system.

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:38.100
 What's the signal for those in India?

00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:40.900
 I was put in the toilet.

00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:45.260
 So they transported horses to the Olympics in Rio this year, and the race horses got

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:47.580
 more leg rooms than your standard horse transports.

00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:48.580
 Oh.

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:49.580
 I learned.

00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:50.580
 Yeah.

00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:53.060
 So usually it's three horses to a cabin, and these ones were two, because they're special

00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:56.900
 horses with special talents who deserve business class treatment.

00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:58.660
 That is so unegalitarian.

00:36:58.660 --> 00:36:59.660
 Exactly.

00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:05.420
 But they also pilot more carefully with horses than with people.

00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:08.580
 They don't do, normally, we get pilots doing loop-to-loop, so.

00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:10.900
 And the horses just hate that.

00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:15.180
 No, it's not more carefully, but they do more gradual take-offs and landings, so they spend

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:16.900
 much longer on take-off and landing.

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:20.500
 They don't do it as steeply so that the deceleration acceleration isn't as much because

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:21.500
 horses get...

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:24.100
 I don't like horses because you can't explain to a horse, okay, you're going to go in a plane

00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:25.100
 now.

00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:26.100
 Where is the humans?

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:27.100
 We know what's going on.

00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:31.340
 A plane operated by the airline FlyB was first a turn back after a B became stuck in one

00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:32.340
 of its instruments.

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:33.340
 A B.

00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:35.340
 Is that true?

00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:36.340
 Yeah.

00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:37.340
 What which instrument?

00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:39.820
 What instrument on a plane is so sensitive?

00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:42.700
 Well, they're all important, I imagine.

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:44.420
 But B's can't do too much damage, can they?

00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:47.020
 It was like sitting on a button that was crucial, and you thought he'd press it, you'll

00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:48.020
 get stung.

00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:49.020
 Sitting on a button.

00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:52.940
 Oh, maybe it was.

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:53.940
 Lower the landing gear.

00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:54.940
 I can't.

00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:57.060
 It's a peak.

00:37:57.060 --> 00:38:01.980
 A cock-pie-loving man caused a minor alert at Manchester airport when he tried to carry

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:03.420
 one through security.

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:11.100
 Apparently, the juice inside the pie set off the kind of thing that was looking for liquids.

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:15.420
 The people in security said it must have been a very juicy pie.

00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:18.620
 But we've all got liquid in us, so why don't we set off the alarm?

00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:19.620
 That is a great point.

00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:20.620
 You're right.

00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:22.620
 I'm not sure you're quite as juicy as a cock-pie.

00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:23.620
 No.

00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:25.460
 Don't be insane, James.

00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:27.460
 Nobody's as juicy as a good pork pie.

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:34.140
 Anyone would think that this was just a made-up story by a tap like he's paid for.

00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:35.380
 We should end.

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:44.140
