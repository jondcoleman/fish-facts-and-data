00:00:00,00:00:18,"""Hi everybody. Welcome back to No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:00:18,00:00:23,from the QI offices in Covent Garden. My name is Andrew Hunter Murray. I am sitting here
00:00:23,00:00:28,"with Anna Tijinski, James Harkin and Anne Miller. And once again, we have gathered around"
00:00:28,00:00:32,"the microphones with our four favourite facts, not from the last seven days, from our new"
00:00:32,00:00:38,"book. Oh my goodness, we've written a book. It's called One, Three, Four, Two, QI Facts"
00:00:38,00:00:44,"to leave you flabbergasted and it is out now. To celebrate that and plug the book, we have"
00:00:44,00:00:49,"each brought our favourite fact from the book. And starting in no particular order, we begin"
00:00:49,00:00:58,"with James. Okay, my fact is that four-year-old mice are less common than 100-year-old humans."
00:00:58,00:01:05,"Nice. Might as well do all 100-year-old humans are very posh, aren't they? So, I see."
00:01:05,00:01:10,It's a play on the word common. I don't know how you class a mouse though. What do you
00:01:10,00:01:21,"mean? Do they like Cheddar or Ementel or Yark? So yeah, this is just simply a fact that mice"
00:01:21,00:01:26,"don't live very long. Yeah, it's unbelievable that they're so short-lived. It's not extraordinary."
00:01:26,00:01:31,"They're tiny. That's interesting what you say, Andy, because you're equating smallness"
00:01:31,00:01:38,"with lack of longevity. Do you think that's true in general? No, I guess because they're"
00:01:38,00:01:44,"smallnesses. It was like tiny grades. Yeah, true. All right, I take it all back."
00:01:44,00:01:50,Parrots? They're quite small. They're bigger than a mouse as well.
00:01:50,00:01:54,"They live a long time, Parrots. Oh, yeah. Yeah, there's one parrot called Charlie the Parrot"
00:01:54,00:01:59,who's owner claims he's 117 and used to belong to Winston Churchill. But what I like is
00:01:59,00:02:04,if one's looked into this and so Mr. Oram who owns him now says his father-in-law sold
00:02:04,00:02:10,him to Churchill in 1937 and then got him back when Churchill died and the Churchill family
00:02:10,00:02:14,and all historians have questioned this and say they can't find any evidence that Churchill
00:02:14,00:02:18,"owned a parrot. And I would have just thought, like obviously we'd know if Churchill had"
00:02:18,00:02:22,"a pet parrot, right? No, I don't think we would because. Do you remember there was that thing"
00:02:22,00:02:25,when Frobe's came out and they were banned from government offices because they could repeat
00:02:25,00:02:29,"things? So if he had a parrot, he would have to be illegal. Because he might repeat all"
00:02:29,00:02:35,the secrets. So you couldn't tell anyone that you had a parrot? Churchill had a secret parrot
00:02:35,00:02:40,is what we're saying. This is the greatest conspiracy fact.
00:02:40,00:02:46,"So the world's oldest mouse, which is an article about whom I found this fact is called"
00:02:46,00:02:52,"Yoda and Yoda celebrated his fourth birthday on April 10th. Yeah, yeah, and he got to the"
00:02:52,00:02:58,age of four and this is the quote in a pathogen free rest home for geriatric mice. And he had
00:02:58,00:03:04,"a cage make called Princess Leia. And I said this, I mentioned this to Dan, who was sitting"
00:03:04,00:03:07,"in the room and I was doing my research earlier. And Dan very dismissively said, they didn't"
00:03:07,00:03:15,"even meet. So that Yoda, basically, if you're four years old as a mouse, that's the equivalence"
00:03:15,00:03:21,"of 136 in human years. Wow. This is very old. Yeah. Well, it's older than any humans have"
00:03:21,00:03:28,"been. Yeah. So well done mice. They've beaten us in a way. So, so we've definitely beaten them."
00:03:28,00:03:31,"It's weird though, because they're doing a lot of experiments into how to make mice"
00:03:31,00:03:34,live longer in the hope that we can then make humans live longer the same way. And one
00:03:34,00:03:39,thing it does work is calorie restricted diets that they just live longer when you give
00:03:39,00:03:45,them less calories. But lots of mice in cages are fed a diet which is almost exclusively
00:03:45,00:03:48,"starch and sugar. It's like feeding someone donuts, basically, and expecting them to"
00:03:48,00:03:52,"get to a ripe old age. Although they, I mean, when they eat in the wild, they live less"
00:03:52,00:03:55,long than when they eat in captivity. And they eat more than starch and sugar in the wild
00:03:55,00:04:01,"presumably. I guess the wild is less easy habitat to get to an old age in because it's,"
00:04:01,00:04:04,"you know, you're outdoors and you're exposed to the elements slightly less than a pathogen"
00:04:04,00:04:10,free rest home. Yeah. Yeah. There was a guy already a fall last week who was saying that
00:04:10,00:04:12,domestic cats should all be euthanised and no one should be allowed them because they
00:04:12,00:04:18,"caused such devastation to the bird population. Yeah. Yeah. It's very, very angry. They kill"
00:04:18,00:04:23,lots of small animals. And I think I've heard that especially in Australia they're trying
00:04:23,00:04:28,"to, you know, get rid of cats. Yeah. I think they've destroyed something like 65 bird species"
00:04:28,00:04:33,in the last 50 years. Oh. There's quite a lot of species to have got rid of. Yeah. Yeah.
00:04:33,00:04:37,I was looking at a research lab called the Jackson Lab which I think this one was in Maine
00:04:37,00:04:45,and they had mice who they said before and a half. I've opened that down there. There must
00:04:45,00:04:50,"be three and a half. If this is the oldest. But they, what they had mice who they said before"
00:04:50,00:04:54,"and a half, which they said is over twice the life expectancy. And I quite like this quote."
00:04:54,00:04:58,So the researcher who's working with the most closely said the mice are two girls and
00:04:58,00:05:01,"she's become really, really attached to them. So she totally loves them now and she treats"
00:05:01,00:05:06,"them really, really well. And she says we move them to a new cage and we take care when"
00:05:06,00:05:09,"we pick them up to cup them in our hands, rather than pick them up by the tail with the four"
00:05:09,00:05:15,steps. It's the luxury mice. Yeah. It's a level of extreme care and attention they get.
00:05:15,00:05:19,"My friend told me that because rabbits are natural prey, every time you pick up a rabbit"
00:05:19,00:05:22,it thinks it's about to be eaten. So it's really stressful for rabbits to be handled. It's
00:05:22,00:05:26,way too big. It might really gently let go down to them. Otherwise you think you're picking
00:05:26,00:05:29,up for a hug. It thinks. Yeah. That's why they're completely bastards when you pick
00:05:29,00:05:33,them up. I don't suppose any animals really think when you pick them up they're going
00:05:33,00:05:38,to get a hug. They should be consistently pleasantly surprised in that case.
00:05:38,00:05:45,"And Robert, it's so ungrateful. Have you guys heard of the Black 6 C57 BL/6. Slash 6?"
00:05:45,00:05:55,Yeah. No. This is so cool. This is a particular kind of mouse which gets used in almost all experiments.
00:05:55,00:06:01,It's like the standard currency of mouse experiments. Five in six American research mice are
00:06:01,00:06:06,there's one very particular strain. It was created in 1921 or a huge thing like there's a huge
00:06:06,00:06:12,article on slate about them. Created in 1921 when a mouse codenamed C52 mounted one called
00:06:12,00:06:19,C57 and deposited its semen in her reproductive tract with a waxy plug. That's a very sexy article
00:06:19,00:06:25,you've been reading. And so basically almost all experiments in America are mice and most
00:06:25,00:06:31,experiments on animals are done on mice. So it's most of most of them. And the problem is
00:06:31,00:06:36,we think that they're kind of standard mice and they're treated as such in experiments.
00:06:36,00:06:40,"But they're really unusual. They all think they're special. Well, no, they are special."
00:06:40,00:06:44,This is the interesting thing because they are susceptible to morphine addiction and they
00:06:44,00:06:51,"like alcohol. And that makes you special, does it? Normal mice, I'm afraid not. It doesn't"
00:06:51,00:06:56,make you special. But they're exceptional in their pain responses and other things like
00:06:56,00:07:00,this. So actually there's no such thing as a perfect average mouse to experiment on.
00:07:00,00:07:06,That's really interesting because what you lose by having the mouse be it one kind you gain
00:07:06,00:07:10,because all your experiments are controlled by the same kind of mice. Exactly. Yeah. That's
00:07:10,00:07:18,"true. And one thing it does, it does mouse barbering behavior. So cutting mice hair. Yeah."
00:07:18,00:07:22,This is where you have several different mice in the same cage. The dominant mouse will
00:07:22,00:07:29,selectively remove hair from its cage mates to show that it's in charge. All the subordinate
00:07:29,00:07:34,"mice are going around with little bulb patches on them. Really? Wow, to mark them out as his"
00:07:34,00:07:38,"slaves. Yeah. Actually speaking of my stress, you know mice are more stressed around men than"
00:07:38,00:07:42,around women and they've just discovered this and they think it's going to have to be controlled
00:07:42,00:07:46,for in future experiments with mice. Do we know why? So we assume it's because they have
00:07:46,00:07:50,a reaction to the testosterone. So they just have the same reaction as they do to male mice.
00:07:50,00:07:54,And a male is often going to be more bellicose I suppose. I've just made mice. I've just
00:07:54,00:07:58,island feminists and they get really annoyed with the patriarchy. It could be that. They
00:07:58,00:08:03,definitely release more of this stress hormone. So they put male researchers with mice and
00:08:03,00:08:07,their bodies cause through with all these hormones that they don't have when they have they're
00:08:07,00:08:10,"with females. But yeah, it means in future when you're doing experiments, we need to control"
00:08:10,00:08:13,for that because their bodies are behaving completely differently depending on his working
00:08:13,00:08:17,on them. Will we become more stressed when I approach them than when another woman approaches
00:08:17,00:08:21,"them? Yeah, I've noticed that. Does that make me a mouse? No, no, I've made you a researcher"
00:08:21,00:08:28,"and then a mouse. Oh, it makes it work, does it? It's not just women there and is it? People,"
00:08:28,00:08:32,people who come stressed when I approach them. And mice actually. Did you see that they've
00:08:32,00:08:38,"made transparent mice? No. Yeah, I mean, no, you obviously wouldn't see that they've"
00:08:38,00:08:41,"made transparent mice with you. Where have the transparent mice? Oh no, that's okay,"
00:08:41,00:08:47,"they're still there. Go on, Andy, you can see a window. Can you? Can you? You can see a window"
00:08:47,00:08:50,frame. You can see where the window is. I'm looking at the window right now and I'm doubting.
00:08:50,00:08:55,I know has these amazing eyes that can see the molecules in the glass. They can see reflections
00:08:55,00:09:02,"and little bits of grime. Okay, these mice. They've got fingerprints all over them. Yes."
00:09:02,00:09:05,So scientists have made transparent mice and this is on something they do to mice after
00:09:05,00:09:10,they've died is they inject chemicals into them and they pump these chemicals through
00:09:10,00:09:13,"their blood vessels, through their brain, through their spinal cords, through all their organs."
00:09:13,00:09:18,"And it gets sort of he, me, H-E-M-E, which is the stuff in hemoglobin. And that's what gives"
00:09:18,00:09:23,a lot of the stuff in their body its color and other stuff that's big creating obstacles
00:09:23,00:09:28,"to the eyes. And it makes them completely transparent, but it means that we can study them"
00:09:28,00:09:31,"much more easily because usually when you're studying dead mice as organs, let's say you've"
00:09:31,00:09:36,"got a diabetic mouse and you want to work out how that works, then you'd have to cut"
00:09:36,00:09:40,"the organs up and you could distort them. But in this way, you can just look at it from"
00:09:40,00:09:44,the outside and see everything inside it. Sure. It'd be more useful to have transparent
00:09:44,00:09:47,"living mice, I think. I know. I think they're working on that."
00:09:47,00:09:52,Yeah. Didn't you find a thing in QI about putting windows and cows?
00:09:52,00:09:56,"Yeah. So they put these windows and cow's stomachs, which means that you can, if a cow's"
00:09:56,00:10:00,"got a stomach infection, you can just insert whatever is needed to be inserted into the cow's"
00:10:00,00:10:06,"stomach to make its infection better. That's very cool. Other old animals? Oh, yeah."
00:10:06,00:10:11,Greenland sharks. Yeah. They're really old. They've recently found out that they might live
00:10:11,00:10:18,"up to around 400 years, maybe even older. What? They looked at some females, 28 female Greenland"
00:10:18,00:10:24,"sharks. And they worked out that they, all this one, was somewhere between 272 years old"
00:10:24,00:10:30,"and 512 years old. Wow. The Greenland shark, they didn't know until quite recently how long"
00:10:30,00:10:34,"they actually lived. This is like, could be anywhere between like 20 and 400 years and no"
00:10:34,00:10:40,"one years. Well, still it's anywhere between 272 and 512, which is quite a big discrabbit."
00:10:40,00:10:47,"1744, that one would have been born at the least. The 2721? Yeah, if it was sharp."
00:10:47,00:10:50,It's a shame they couldn't have been born in a year where one of us had a useful historical
00:10:50,00:10:55,reference to compare it to 1744. Anyone got anything? I'm not talking about my head.
00:10:55,00:11:00,"So one of the King George's was on the throne. Great. Thanks, Andy. That's really"
00:11:00,00:11:04,a sport. Do you imagine that? Have you heard of Claire Hollingworth? Claire Hollingworth?
00:11:04,00:11:12,No. No. I was on the list of Wikipedia centenarians basically. They have all these categories
00:11:12,00:11:15,"and they've got, you know, sports people and they've got artists and they've got scientists"
00:11:15,00:11:20,"and they've also got a miscellaneous category. Absolutely. Yes, please. And Claire Hollingworth"
00:11:20,00:11:28,was the journalist who basically discovered the Second World War. She was 27. How did
00:11:28,00:11:34,"you discover the Second World War? Well, she broke the story in Britain, basically."
00:11:34,00:11:39,"And when I say that, she was 27, she was a brand new journalist, as in she had just met"
00:11:39,00:11:42,"the editor of the telegraph and said, why aren't you hire me and why aren't you send me"
00:11:42,00:11:47,"to Poland? So he wrote, learnt it and sent it to Poland. And a few days into her trip,"
00:11:47,00:11:51,she was returning to Poland after a cross-border trip into Germany. And she noticed all
00:11:51,00:11:56,"the way along the road, there were these big screens of Hessian up alongside the road"
00:11:56,00:12:01,and the wind blew one of them up and it revealed loads of German tanks.
00:12:01,00:12:08,No way. Did Germany invade Poland by the load of screens? And then the wind blew and they're
00:12:08,00:12:12,"like, oh, dumb. It's very scary. I've got to win with that. It's very Scooby-Doo, isn't it?"
00:12:12,00:12:18,"This is what happened. No, it is. It is. This was from the Guardian. I trust the Guardian."
00:12:18,00:12:23,Has anyone checked whether Germany's invaded anywhere else recently? Look for the Hessian
00:12:23,00:12:27,"screens. Wait, how, I have no idea how that's related to what we're talking about."
00:12:27,00:12:34,Centenarians. She lived to 100. Sorry. She's more common than a four-year-old mouse. Nice.
00:12:34,00:12:40,"Yeah, Centenarians. So I was looking up some things about aging and how we can age better."
00:12:40,00:12:43,"And so, you know, people always go and look at villages in town, sort of full of really"
00:12:43,00:12:47,really old people. And so the latest is a report in NPR which looked at the village of
00:12:47,00:12:52,"Akia Ruli in Italy. And it has 300 people in it who are over 100, which is a third of"
00:12:52,00:12:57,the population of that village. And so a doctor went there and did a little study and
00:12:57,00:13:01,noted that there were two dietary habits. And I basically mentioned this so people can
00:13:01,00:13:06,take it on board and imitate it. He said that everyone ate anchovies at every meal and
00:13:06,00:13:11,they had rosemary with everything. And that's the key. That's the secret.
00:13:11,00:13:14,"Oh, that's weird, isn't it? Because I wouldn't have personally just wouldn't put those"
00:13:14,00:13:20,two things together. Every meal. They're having every meal anchovies and rosemary.
00:13:20,00:13:26,"Look, they're not enjoying the taste, James. But that's a bit of advice. I looked at these"
00:13:26,00:13:29,tips too and they're brilliant because they always contradict each other. And there's one
00:13:29,00:13:35,"where if you sleep for fewer than six hours a night, you're four times a lot late to die."
00:13:35,00:13:39,"But if you sleep for more seven to eight hours, 30% higher chance of death, which means you"
00:13:39,00:13:43,"sleep for basically exactly six hours according to these studies, or you're going to die."
00:13:43,00:13:44,"I mean, you're going to die anyway."
00:13:44,00:13:46,"Before you're going to die anyway, is the problem?"
00:13:46,00:13:47,I'm not.
00:13:47,00:13:50,"I don't know about you guys. Since someone's worrying, it's said that for every hour of TV you watch"
00:13:50,00:13:55,"after the age 25, you knock off 22 minutes off your life expectancy."
00:13:55,00:13:58,What if you're watching an hour long documentary on how to extend your life?
00:13:58,00:14:01,It's called a Paradox.
00:14:01,00:14:05,I would do that for quite a lot of TV shows. I would take that ahead.
00:14:05,00:14:06,What about Gogglebox?
00:14:06,00:14:11,Absolutely. Gogglebox is the best one to watch because you get lots of TV in one show.
00:14:11,00:14:15,"I was going to say, what if, if you're watching someone watching TV, is that a 45 minutes"
00:14:15,00:14:17,show? Double penalties.
00:14:17,00:14:20,Some more centenarians just going back to what Andy was saying before.
00:14:20,00:14:24,My incredibly relevant story about Claire Hollingworth.
00:14:24,00:14:25,Isn't that cool? That's what we discussed.
00:14:25,00:14:26,"Anyway, sorry, go on."
00:14:26,00:14:31,"Emma Marano, on Marano, is the oldest person in the world at the moment."
00:14:31,00:14:36,She is the only person born in the 19th century who's still alive.
00:14:36,00:14:41,"She's the oldest Italian, as well as the oldest of everyone."
00:14:41,00:14:43,Whatever you'd say is she's Italian.
00:14:43,00:14:46,And she's the oldest from a tiny Italian village.
00:14:46,00:14:48,What a coincidence.
00:14:48,00:14:53,She credits her long life to her diet of raw eggs and being single.
00:14:53,00:14:58,I think what she means is she credits being single to her diet of raw eggs.
00:14:58,00:15:04,The oldest man is a guy called Israel Kristal and he's 45 years older than the state of Israel.
00:15:04,00:15:05,Wow.
00:15:05,00:15:06,That's good.
00:15:06,00:15:07,Great.
00:15:07,00:15:08,"Good work, yeah."
00:15:08,00:15:09,So it was named after him.
00:15:09,00:15:10,"No, no."
00:15:10,00:15:13,It was very careful.
00:15:13,00:15:15,It was named after him.
00:15:15,00:15:24,"Okay, it's time for fact number two and that is Anna."
00:15:24,00:15:29,My fact this week is that the detective agency that hunted butch Cassidy also worked for
00:15:29,00:15:30,Coca-Cola.
00:15:30,00:15:35,"Yeah, I just really love this overlapping of its two roles."
00:15:35,00:15:40,So this is a detective agency called the Pinkerton Detective Agency and it was a very
00:15:40,00:15:41,big deal in the 19th century.
00:15:41,00:15:45,It was a bunch of detectives were hired to hunt down all the all the greats of the Wild West.
00:15:45,00:15:51,"So they hunted butch in the Sundance Kid, they hunted Jesse James for years and also they"
00:15:51,00:15:58,were employed in 1916 by this guy called Harold Hirsch who wanted to spy on other companies
00:15:58,00:16:02,and make sure they weren't stealing Coca-Cola's trademark because he was running Coca-Cola
00:16:02,00:16:03,at the time.
00:16:03,00:16:06,"And yeah, he sent them undercover to soda fountains."
00:16:06,00:16:10,He's almost as dangerous as going after bootcasts.
00:16:10,00:16:14,Can you imagine that career step after being in a shootout with the Sundance Kid.
00:16:14,00:16:19,I'm going to send you to a soda fountain undercover to collect samples of Coca and check.
00:16:19,00:16:20,Really?
00:16:20,00:16:22,There were a lot of limitations.
00:16:22,00:16:25,I found a list of all the companies that they went after for using their name.
00:16:25,00:16:26,Okay.
00:16:26,00:16:27,You want to hear something?
00:16:27,00:16:28,Yeah.
00:16:28,00:16:29,Some of them are very close.
00:16:29,00:16:34,"So they were after a candy-cola, celery-cola, Coca-Cola, or with K's."
00:16:34,00:16:39,"Coca-Cola Coke with a see-then-a-k, Coca and Coca-Cola hyphenated, Coca-Rica, yes, it's"
00:16:39,00:16:41,a Coca-Cola and Coca-Cola.
00:16:41,00:16:45,"Coca-Cola all with K's is especially egregious, that's outrageous."
00:16:45,00:16:50,"I saw Coke, K, O, K, E, and they also went after a company called Dope."
00:16:50,00:16:51,Dope?
00:16:51,00:16:52,Yeah.
00:16:52,00:16:53,Dope and Coke.
00:16:53,00:16:54,Yeah.
00:16:54,00:16:58,They were made by the same manufacturer who had actually been a partner of the guy who went
00:16:58,00:17:01,"on to set up Coca-Cola, but yeah, they called it Dope."
00:17:01,00:17:06,"So the Coca-Cola company sort of begs people that it's advertising, not to refer to their"
00:17:06,00:17:10,"drink as Coke, because that made it much easier to copy because so many drinks are called Coke."
00:17:10,00:17:14,"But people still did call it Coke, as we do, but equally they called it Dope."
00:17:14,00:17:17,"So you'd say you can have a cup of Dope, and that was obviously a reference to its former"
00:17:17,00:17:18,cocaine content.
00:17:18,00:17:21,So people knew it as the drink that had the drugs in it.
00:17:21,00:17:23,"It didn't have actual cocaine in it, did it?"
00:17:23,00:17:26,"It had the, is it, the Coca-Leaves, or it had..."
00:17:26,00:17:30,"Yeah, it had, I think it had basically cocaine in it."
00:17:30,00:17:34,"What was interesting was that when it was taken out of Coca-Cola, at the very, at the"
00:17:34,00:17:38,"sort of turn of the century, they still, in the advertising implied that it contained cocaine"
00:17:38,00:17:41,because they still wanted people to think they were going to get that kick.
00:17:41,00:17:45,"And so they used to get in trouble, and there was a lawsuit filed against them for implying"
00:17:45,00:17:48,that they drink contained cocaine when outrageously it didn't.
00:17:48,00:17:49,That's fantastic.
00:17:49,00:17:52,"Should we, should we also say who Butch Cassidy was?"
00:17:52,00:17:53,"Oh, yeah."
00:17:53,00:17:57,"Oh, yeah, so Butch Cassidy, for those of you who haven't seen one of the greatest films"
00:17:57,00:18:02,"they've made, was a Wild West outlaw in the 1800s."
00:18:02,00:18:04,And he conducted various train robberies.
00:18:04,00:18:06,He was hunted by this pink to an agency.
00:18:06,00:18:09,"So in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid, it's these detectives who are always on their"
00:18:09,00:18:10,tail.
00:18:10,00:18:14,"And eventually they drove them out of America, and they ended up in Bolivia."
00:18:14,00:18:17,And then there's lots of theories about what happened to them.
00:18:17,00:18:22,"So it's assumed they were killed in a shootout in Bolivia, and that's how the film ends, certainly."
00:18:22,00:18:25,"Or actually, you don't see them dying the film, do you?"
00:18:25,00:18:26,Boyle of very much a legend.
00:18:26,00:18:27,Sorry.
00:18:27,00:18:30,"Sorry, that is true."
00:18:30,00:18:31,"But yeah, there are lots of theories."
00:18:31,00:18:38,"There apparently there was a guy called William T. Phillips, who surfaced in America in 1908"
00:18:38,00:18:39,or 1909.
00:18:39,00:18:43,"And he was recognized by a bunch of people, a bunch of policemen who chased Butch in the"
00:18:43,00:18:46,"olden days, and his ex-girlfriend."
00:18:46,00:18:50,And this guy's adopted son says it had always been accepted in the family that he'd been
00:18:50,00:18:51,Butch Cassidy.
00:18:51,00:18:56,"And he even wrote this manuscript in 1934, William T. Phillips saying, this is what happened"
00:18:56,00:18:59,"to Butch Cassidy without saying, oh, that's who I am."
00:18:59,00:19:02,"But saying Butch Cassidy got away at the shootout, the Sundance kid was killed."
00:19:02,00:19:03,And so--
00:19:03,00:19:06,"And there's little details that he threw in as well, it was really detailed."
00:19:06,00:19:07,Yes.
00:19:07,00:19:08,Photography.
00:19:08,00:19:09,Yeah.
00:19:09,00:19:10,And he didn't die till 1934.
00:19:10,00:19:11,So--
00:19:11,00:19:17,"So one of the former president of Bolivia, René Berrientos, he actually investigated the"
00:19:17,00:19:20,idea that Butch and Sundance had been killed in a shootout outside of Bolivian
00:19:20,00:19:21,bank.
00:19:21,00:19:25,"He interviewed villagers personally who had been, you know, witnesses or nearly witnesses."
00:19:25,00:19:27,And he checked out army files.
00:19:27,00:19:30,And I've got in mind those that he dug up bodies.
00:19:30,00:19:33,I think actually he had bodies dug up.
00:19:33,00:19:36,But he eventually concluded that the shootout story was a fabrication.
00:19:36,00:19:37,Did he?
00:19:37,00:19:38,Yeah.
00:19:38,00:19:42,"Although there is a town in Bolivia that says this is the resting place, or here lie Butch Cassidy"
00:19:42,00:19:43,"in the Sundance kid, don't they?"
00:19:43,00:19:45,I think it's called San Vicente.
00:19:45,00:19:46,Oh really?
00:19:46,00:19:47,You would do for the tourism wouldn't you?
00:19:47,00:19:52,"You wouldn't say, butch and Sundance got away from this place."
00:19:52,00:19:53,That's true.
00:19:53,00:19:55,Did you know that the movie was originally called The Sundance Kid and Butch Cassidy?
00:19:55,00:19:56,That's it.
00:19:56,00:19:57,No way.
00:19:57,00:19:58,Wow.
00:19:58,00:19:59,That's not a worst ever name for a film.
00:19:59,00:20:01,"It feels like that's what is now, doesn't it?"
00:20:01,00:20:02,Yeah.
00:20:02,00:20:03,"Well, never know if it would have felt absolutely normal."
00:20:03,00:20:04,Yeah.
00:20:04,00:20:06,Because Paul Newman was going to play Sundance.
00:20:06,00:20:07,That's right.
00:20:07,00:20:08,That's right.
00:20:08,00:20:09,But then they needed to switch that over for some reason.
00:20:09,00:20:13,"And then they had a thing where oddly Robert Revford, who wasn't as big a star, was"
00:20:13,00:20:17,then going to be playing Sundance as Sundance was going to be first in the name of the film.
00:20:17,00:20:20,"So then they said, well, we have to switch the name of the film as well now."
00:20:20,00:20:21,Doesn't make any sense.
00:20:21,00:20:23,Sundance was the protégé.
00:20:23,00:20:27,It would have been totally ridiculous and not in accordance with the real history of the
00:20:27,00:20:28,thing.
00:20:28,00:20:29,All right.
00:20:29,00:20:30,Okay.
00:20:30,00:20:35,"But yeah, I think I said in a, might have said before that he had a Lancasterian accent."
00:20:35,00:20:36,Was it this movie?
00:20:36,00:20:37,This movie.
00:20:37,00:20:42,"Well, his father and mother both came from the North of England and didn't move to America"
00:20:42,00:20:43,till quite late on in life.
00:20:43,00:20:44,That sounds great.
00:20:44,00:20:45,"Oh, yeah."
00:20:45,00:20:46,Suddenly a one over.
00:20:46,00:20:47,Yeah.
00:20:47,00:20:51,"Well, you know, people always say that I sound like a real butch world west."
00:20:51,00:20:52,Yeah.
00:20:52,00:20:53,And you really remind me of Paul Newman.
00:20:53,00:20:54,"So, yeah."
00:20:54,00:20:57,"I don't know what he looks like, but I can only imagine."
00:20:57,00:21:00,"Oh, I mean, he's the most attractive man ever."
00:21:00,00:21:01,Born.
00:21:01,00:21:04,I can see where you're coming from now.
00:21:04,00:21:05,The Pinkerton detectives then.
00:21:05,00:21:07,Do you guys have stuff on that?
00:21:07,00:21:08,Um.
00:21:08,00:21:09,And their motto.
00:21:09,00:21:10,Okay.
00:21:10,00:21:11,What was their motto?
00:21:11,00:21:12,We never sleep.
00:21:12,00:21:13,We never sleep.
00:21:13,00:21:14,And also we're chronically exhausted.
00:21:14,00:21:15,Yeah.
00:21:15,00:21:19,"I read in one place that their logo was a large black and white eye, and that's supposedly"
00:21:19,00:21:21,"where the phrase ""private eye"" comes from."
00:21:21,00:21:22,Yeah.
00:21:22,00:21:23,Oh.
00:21:23,00:21:24,Yeah.
00:21:24,00:21:25,"Oh, that's true."
00:21:25,00:21:26,Do you know who Pinkerton was?
00:21:26,00:21:27,He was a barrel maker.
00:21:27,00:21:28,He was from Scotland.
00:21:28,00:21:29,Yeah.
00:21:29,00:21:30,And living near Chicago.
00:21:30,00:21:31,"Oh, I like him already."
00:21:31,00:21:35,And one night he went to the woods to get more wood for staves to make into barrels.
00:21:35,00:21:39,And he found the remains of a campsite and he got suspicious and he went back the following
00:21:39,00:21:40,night.
00:21:40,00:21:42,And he found a group of counterfeiters making coins.
00:21:42,00:21:45,"And he got the gang arrest and everyone said, ""Oh, great job, Pinkerton."
00:21:45,00:21:48,"You should investigate more of these counterfeit cases."""
00:21:48,00:21:49,And so he did.
00:21:49,00:21:52,He just started investigating things and then set up this enormous country-wide agency.
00:21:52,00:21:56,So he had a Scottish accent and Custley had a Lancasterian accent.
00:21:56,00:22:00,"So if they ever do an audio play of this, then Anne and I could play the two."
00:22:00,00:22:01,Yeah.
00:22:01,00:22:08,And I think there are agents already if anyone's ringing off the hook next door.
00:22:08,00:22:10,But I think they were seen as a threat to Pinkerton's by the end of the 19th century
00:22:10,00:22:17,and in fact were forced to disband because they were so big and the government law enforcement
00:22:17,00:22:19,didn't like that they were posing this threat.
00:22:19,00:22:23,So they were larger than the US military by the 1890s.
00:22:23,00:22:26,So they were larger than the US military by the 1890s.
00:22:26,00:22:31,"They had 2,000 people full-time on their books and they had 30,000 reserves, which is more"
00:22:31,00:22:33,men than in a standing army.
00:22:33,00:22:34,For a detective work.
00:22:34,00:22:35,I know.
00:22:35,00:22:36,Yeah.
00:22:36,00:22:37,That's amazing.
00:22:37,00:22:38,It is amazing.
00:22:38,00:22:39,"They were all reserves, of course."
00:22:39,00:22:40,So I don't know if they could have called them all up full-time.
00:22:40,00:22:41,No.
00:22:41,00:22:44,I think they all had normal jobs probably most of the time and then sort of spied on people
00:22:44,00:22:45,as a hobby at weekend.
00:22:45,00:22:46,I'm a Pinkerton.
00:22:46,00:22:48,There's 30 of you with notebooks.
00:22:48,00:22:49,Yeah.
00:22:49,00:22:51,Do you know what Pepsi was originally called?
00:22:51,00:22:52,What?
00:22:52,00:22:53,Brad's Drink.
00:22:53,00:22:56,Was it just for Brad?
00:22:56,00:22:57,It was just for Brad.
00:22:57,00:23:02,"It was Caleb Bradham, who was the inventor and it was named, it was like Coca-Cola, but"
00:23:02,00:23:03,it didn't have any Coca-Cola in it.
00:23:03,00:23:06,So I think they were casting around desperately for another name.
00:23:06,00:23:11,"It's interesting that Coca-Cola, these days you could buy a bottle with the word Brad on"
00:23:11,00:23:12,it.
00:23:12,00:23:14,That must really sting to Pepsi.
00:23:14,00:23:15,Yeah.
00:23:15,00:23:16,That's a good point.
00:23:16,00:23:18,If you're out.
00:23:18,00:23:21,Freud said it cured his depression and made him more sexually active.
00:23:21,00:23:22,Coca-Cola.
00:23:22,00:23:23,Coca-Cola.
00:23:23,00:23:24,Coca-Cola.
00:23:24,00:23:25,Really?
00:23:25,00:23:26,Yeah.
00:23:26,00:23:27,"They would say, what would you like to drink in a go?"
00:23:27,00:23:28,Coke.
00:23:28,00:23:29,Coke.
00:23:29,00:23:30,Okay.
00:23:30,00:23:36,"It's time for fact number three, which is my fact."
00:23:36,00:23:42,Which is that you cannot get to the highest point of Mauritania with a compass.
00:23:42,00:23:43,Right.
00:23:43,00:23:44,"Well, you can't get to it."
00:23:44,00:23:45,You can't take a compass with you.
00:23:45,00:23:50,"But you can't use a compass to navigate to it, even if you have a map and the opposition."
00:23:50,00:23:56,"Because it's completely made of magnetite with the mountain, which is a natural magnet and"
00:23:56,00:23:58,"as a result, it'll send your compass completely haywire."
00:23:58,00:24:03,"Well, you would think, actually, that no matter where you were in the world, if you were"
00:24:03,00:24:07,"close enough, it would point you towards this massive mountain, so actually, it would work"
00:24:07,00:24:08,really well.
00:24:08,00:24:09,"It wouldn't get you to the top, would it?"
00:24:09,00:24:11,Because it would just point directly down at the mountain once you got it.
00:24:11,00:24:12,So it would get you to the base of the mountain.
00:24:12,00:24:13,That's a really good point.
00:24:13,00:24:16,"But it would be perfect for getting you to the base of the mountain, but then it's useless."
00:24:16,00:24:22,"But I read this amazing article this week, I think it's on crack, about life saving tips"
00:24:22,00:24:23,and things that you should know.
00:24:23,00:24:26,"And they said that if you get caught in an avalanche, everything is white, so you could"
00:24:26,00:24:27,be cooked on the witch way down.
00:24:27,00:24:28,Which way is down?
00:24:28,00:24:30,What you should do is you should clear some space around your mouth and spit.
00:24:30,00:24:33,"And whichever way you spit falls, you do, which is down, so you go down the way."
00:24:33,00:24:37,"Do you really think you wouldn't know which way was down, because you still have gravity?"
00:24:37,00:24:39,You're still going to be light headed.
00:24:39,00:24:40,I sometimes get that in bed.
00:24:40,00:24:41,Do you?
00:24:41,00:24:42,Do you spell your face?
00:24:42,00:24:45,"You know the thing where you're like about a momentarily, you don't know which way you're"
00:24:45,00:24:46,facing.
00:24:46,00:24:47,Sure.
00:24:47,00:24:48,But that's not really the same.
00:24:48,00:24:52,"The one way you can't breathe, that's your facing into the pillow, Andy."
00:24:52,00:24:54,"This mountain, just to say, is blue, isn't it?"
00:24:54,00:24:55,Yeah.
00:24:55,00:24:56,Which is quite cool.
00:24:56,00:24:57,So you could definitely find it without a com.
00:24:57,00:24:58,I think it's the magnetite that makes it blue.
00:24:58,00:25:01,"So from above, you can identify it."
00:25:01,00:25:08,"And there's this other amazing thing in Mauritania, which is 25 kilometres wide, but we didn't"
00:25:08,00:25:12,know it existed until we had the ability to fly.
00:25:12,00:25:14,This is the thing called the Eye of the Sahara.
00:25:14,00:25:16,"And it was hidden for many, many millennia."
00:25:16,00:25:19,It's this beautiful swirling rock formation.
00:25:19,00:25:21,"It's these blue rocks, and it looks like a big bullseye."
00:25:21,00:25:25,"But no one noticed it was there until, I think it was when we went to space, or maybe"
00:25:25,00:25:30,"when someone was flying over it, but from space they say it becomes particularly striking,"
00:25:30,00:25:33,"because it's in the middle of the Sahara, so there's nothing all around in this huge"
00:25:33,00:25:34,Bruce world.
00:25:34,00:25:37,Gemini for in 1965 was when they discovered it.
00:25:37,00:25:38,Was it?
00:25:38,00:25:39,Yeah.
00:25:39,00:25:40,"And we have no idea what it is, do we?"
00:25:40,00:25:42,"They thought it was from an asteroid, but now they don't think so."
00:25:42,00:25:46,"And now they're saying they think it's seismic activity, pushing this dome up."
00:25:46,00:25:48,But why is it a circle?
00:25:48,00:25:49,They have no idea.
00:25:49,00:25:51,"Yeah, some kind of uplift."
00:25:51,00:25:54,"It does happen fairly often, but not very often in a circular way."
00:25:54,00:25:55,Yeah.
00:25:55,00:25:58,It's basically like art attack when you'd be doing the big one and you wouldn't know what
00:25:58,00:25:59,it was.
00:25:59,00:26:02,"And they pan out at the end, and you see it, and that's what they basically this is like."
00:26:02,00:26:03,"Yeah, that was great."
00:26:03,00:26:04,Yeah.
00:26:04,00:26:05,It's bloody loved that.
00:26:05,00:26:06,Mauritania is an interesting country.
00:26:06,00:26:08,It's 90% Sahara desert.
00:26:08,00:26:11,It's only got 3.5 million people.
00:26:11,00:26:16,And yet they have found the time to have 11 coos or attempted coos since 1960.
00:26:16,00:26:17,11 coos?
00:26:17,00:26:18,That's a lot.
00:26:18,00:26:19,Yeah.
00:26:19,00:26:20,It's a good solid number.
00:26:20,00:26:22,And also they still have loads of slavery.
00:26:22,00:26:24,"The most coos is Bolivia, isn't it?"
00:26:24,00:26:25,I think.
00:26:25,00:26:26,They've had loads.
00:26:26,00:26:30,They've had something like 191 in the 190 year history.
00:26:30,00:26:33,They've certainly had one more coo than they've had years.
00:26:33,00:26:34,Yeah.
00:26:34,00:26:36,"Well, that'll be the cocaine."
00:26:36,00:26:40,"And there was a really weird incident, and did you see this, 2012 in Mauritania, where"
00:26:40,00:26:43,the president was shot.
00:26:43,00:26:45,"And then they said, ""Oh, the president's been shot by accident."
00:26:45,00:26:46,It's fine.
00:26:46,00:26:49,"It was a mistake, and just a bit of a mix up."
00:26:49,00:26:50,"And it's all fine now."""
00:26:50,00:26:53,"And that may have been a, you know, an aborted coo or something like that."
00:26:53,00:26:54,Really?
00:26:54,00:26:55,Yeah.
00:26:55,00:26:57,Some things on highest points.
00:26:57,00:26:58,"Oh, yeah."
00:26:58,00:27:03,There's a list of highest points of countries on Wikipedia.
00:27:03,00:27:05,Murray Hill is the highest point of Christmas Island.
00:27:05,00:27:06,Oh.
00:27:06,00:27:07,It was a nice fact.
00:27:07,00:27:08,"Oh, I'm absolutely chuffed."
00:27:08,00:27:15,Do you think there are many tennis fans who have accidentally booked a trip to Murray Hill?
00:27:15,00:27:21,The highest point of the French Polynesian Island territory of Wallace and Futuna is called
00:27:21,00:27:22,Mount Puke.
00:27:22,00:27:23,"Oh, yeah."
00:27:23,00:27:24,Yeah.
00:27:24,00:27:26,"P-U-K-E, but it's pronounced poo-k."
00:27:26,00:27:30,Wallace and Futuna is one of the quietest places in the world.
00:27:30,00:27:31,It is so quiet.
00:27:31,00:27:32,You've been there.
00:27:32,00:27:33,You've been there.
00:27:33,00:27:34,"No, I haven't."
00:27:34,00:27:35,But James and I did a thing.
00:27:35,00:27:36,We were researching loads and loads of countries.
00:27:36,00:27:39,And James started at the beginning of the alphabet and I started at the end.
00:27:39,00:27:44,"And let's just say, the afternoon, I spent researching Wallace and Futuna was pretty slow."
00:27:44,00:27:46,Did you find the Mount Puke thing?
00:27:46,00:27:47,I think I did.
00:27:47,00:27:48,Yeah.
00:27:48,00:27:49,I think there's not much else.
00:27:49,00:27:50,"I mean, there are about two things on there."
00:27:50,00:27:54,And one of them is a place called Mount Puke is quite hard even for a search of my limited
00:27:54,00:27:55,ability to find it.
00:27:55,00:27:56,Is it even a volcano?
00:27:56,00:27:57,Because that might make sense.
00:27:57,00:28:00,Is it puking again?
00:28:00,00:28:04,"It comes from the Polynesian word poo-k, which means mound."
00:28:04,00:28:05,I see.
00:28:05,00:28:09,"And poo-k, poo-k means like an uneven surface or something with lots of mounds."
00:28:09,00:28:10,So does it mean mound?
00:28:10,00:28:11,Mound mound.
00:28:11,00:28:12,Mound mound.
00:28:12,00:28:13,Yeah.
00:28:13,00:28:15,Do you think they get annoyed with having to explain to every single British lad tourist
00:28:15,00:28:17,who comes that it's pronounced poo-k?
00:28:17,00:28:20,There are no British lad tourists of Wallace and Futuna.
00:28:20,00:28:23,"Actually, I'm just looking up Wallace and Futuna now."
00:28:23,00:28:26,I'm just going to see what gems I can find.
00:28:26,00:28:30,No one has opened this file since the 25th of October 2011.
00:28:30,00:28:31,This is very exciting.
00:28:31,00:28:33,"This is like ancient history, a few I saw."
00:28:33,00:28:34,A little time capsule.
00:28:34,00:28:35,Yeah.
00:28:35,00:28:37,Do you want to know the mountain fact from the book while you're looking at it?
00:28:37,00:28:38,Sure.
00:28:38,00:28:40,So the highest point of Canada was only determined in 1992.
00:28:40,00:28:41,Really?
00:28:41,00:28:42,Yeah.
00:28:42,00:28:43,Really?
00:28:43,00:28:44,"Yeah, I won't show before then."
00:28:44,00:28:49,"When Edmund Hillary got to the top of Everest, he celebrated by having a wee."
00:28:49,00:28:51,That's how I usually celebrate.
00:28:51,00:28:54,"Actually, you've been celebrating a bit much around the office recently, and to be honest."
00:28:54,00:28:55,It's true.
00:28:55,00:28:56,It was my birthday yesterday.
00:28:56,00:28:57,I thought you'd appreciate it.
00:28:57,00:29:01,I left it on your desk and everything.
00:29:01,00:29:04,Can we see what else is in that Wallace and Futuna?
00:29:04,00:29:07,"Guys, it's pretty thin groove."
00:29:07,00:29:08,Population.
00:29:08,00:29:13,"Population is 15,400, which is about a tenth that of Swindon."
00:29:13,00:29:14,That's good.
00:29:14,00:29:15,That's okay.
00:29:15,00:29:16,Okay.
00:29:16,00:29:22,It was the only French colony to side with the Vischy collaborationist government during
00:29:22,00:29:23,the Second World War.
00:29:23,00:29:24,Yeah.
00:29:24,00:29:30,And that lasted until a regiment of US Marines arrived in 1942 and said cannibalism was banned
00:29:30,00:29:31,there in 1830.
00:29:31,00:29:32,Oh.
00:29:32,00:29:34,"Oh, that's quite ahead of its time."
00:29:34,00:29:35,Yeah.
00:29:35,00:29:36,For cannibalism.
00:29:36,00:29:37,"No, it's not."
00:29:37,00:29:38,In Polynesia.
00:29:38,00:29:41,Cannibalism is still technically not illegal in the UK.
00:29:41,00:29:42,You're right.
00:29:42,00:29:44,There's not a specific law.
00:29:44,00:29:45,"Basically, they'll do you for something."
00:29:45,00:29:46,Yeah.
00:29:46,00:29:47,But not that.
00:29:47,00:29:51,So you could be done for desecrating grave or a corpse or a movement of evidence.
00:29:51,00:29:52,Yeah.
00:29:52,00:29:55,"There's a lot of things you can get done for, but specifically cannibalism is not illegal"
00:29:55,00:29:58,"in the UK, but it is illegal in Wallace and Futuna."
00:29:58,00:30:00,It has been for a hundred and a half years.
00:30:00,00:30:04,"Actually, Mauritania was the last country in the world to abolish slavery, which it did"
00:30:04,00:30:05,in 2007.
00:30:05,00:30:06,2007.
00:30:06,00:30:10,"Yeah, and it didn't make it a crime until 2012."
00:30:10,00:30:11,Wow.
00:30:11,00:30:14,"But the thing is, I've read reports saying that it still happens a lot."
00:30:14,00:30:15,Yeah.
00:30:15,00:30:16,It's four years out.
00:30:16,00:30:17,It's not long to change.
00:30:17,00:30:19,"This is, I mean, such rough estimates."
00:30:19,00:30:23,Between 4% and 20% of the population are still enslaved.
00:30:23,00:30:24,So what?
00:30:24,00:30:30,"Although, in the interest of balance, I think the Mauritonian government has denied that"
00:30:30,00:30:32,has said that foreign reports of it are exaggerated.
00:30:32,00:30:35,Should we talk a bit about magnets for legal safety?
00:30:35,00:30:36,Yeah.
00:30:36,00:30:37,"Yes, magnet."
00:30:37,00:30:41,"So here, line up from north to south even when fleeing, do they?"
00:30:41,00:30:44,Even if that involves fleeing straight into the hands of the person that are running away
00:30:44,00:30:45,for help.
00:30:45,00:30:49,"No, actually, it might make sense because it keeps the herd of animals together."
00:30:49,00:30:53,"Unless, of course, they run in different directions."
00:30:53,00:30:56,You wouldn't bump into anyone because you're all going parallel to one of them.
00:30:56,00:30:57,Exactly.
00:30:57,00:30:58,Yeah.
00:30:58,00:30:59,I've always went to study this with dogs.
00:30:59,00:31:03,"You know, when they said that dogs poo and line with the earth, magnetic field or something."
00:31:03,00:31:06,"And I know people have done studies, but I'm actually going to go to Richmond Park this"
00:31:06,00:31:11,week and I don't have much on and see if this is actually true because it so doesn't feel
00:31:11,00:31:12,like it's true.
00:31:12,00:31:14,You're going to go and chase deer and see if they run or--
00:31:14,00:31:15,I sure am.
00:31:15,00:31:16,Yeah.
00:31:16,00:31:23,"Okay, it's time for the final effect and that is end."
00:31:23,00:31:28,"My fact is that in 2015, a plane had to make an emergency landing after the smoke alarm"
00:31:28,00:31:30,was triggered by farting sheep.
00:31:30,00:31:31,Amazing.
00:31:31,00:31:36,It was over 2000 sheep in the cargo hold and the alarms went off.
00:31:36,00:31:40,It appears to be the methane emitted by the sheep figured the alarm could not believe that
00:31:40,00:31:45,you can transport 2000 sheep on a plane like a sheep.
00:31:45,00:31:46,That is a lot of sheep.
00:31:46,00:31:47,"Well, I guess they kind of--"
00:31:47,00:31:49,"Well, they don't demand the same leg room."
00:31:49,00:31:55,"Well, the world record for people on a flight is 1888 and two of those were born on during"
00:31:55,00:31:56,the flight.
00:31:56,00:32:00,Was that an air lift out of Israel or something?
00:32:00,00:32:01,Yeah.
00:32:01,00:32:02,Wasn't it out of Africa or into Israel?
00:32:02,00:32:03,You're right.
00:32:03,00:32:04,It was.
00:32:04,00:32:05,Out of Ethiopia and into Israel.
00:32:05,00:32:06,In 1991.
00:32:06,00:32:07,Yeah.
00:32:07,00:32:10,It was a Jewish community who were at a risk of a war or something in Israel or from an air
00:32:10,00:32:11,lift.
00:32:11,00:32:12,That's right.
00:32:12,00:32:14,"But yeah, it's incredible this fact."
00:32:14,00:32:18,This happened again in November last year with goats on a different plane.
00:32:18,00:32:19,What?
00:32:19,00:32:20,That's so weird.
00:32:20,00:32:24,It's happened again in 2014 with cows on a different plane.
00:32:24,00:32:28,Guess what the headline in the Sun article was about the farting goats on the plane.
00:32:28,00:32:29,Goats on a plane.
00:32:29,00:32:30,Not bad.
00:32:30,00:32:31,It's about farting.
00:32:31,00:32:32,Specifically farting.
00:32:32,00:32:33,"Oh, gas."
00:32:33,00:32:34,Gas.
00:32:34,00:32:36,It's almost famous goat.
00:32:36,00:32:39,It's Billy goat gas.
00:32:39,00:32:40,Billy goat.
00:32:40,00:32:41,Goat.
00:32:41,00:32:42,Goat.
00:32:42,00:32:44,That's better than Billy goat gas.
00:32:44,00:32:45,Billy goat goat was the sun headline.
00:32:45,00:32:46,Great.
00:32:46,00:32:50,"Yes, it does seem to be weirdly common."
00:32:50,00:32:52,"They need to get better alarms, I think."
00:32:52,00:32:55,"I suppose if the alarm goes off, you better not be like, oh, it's probably the fart and then"
00:32:55,00:32:56,your plane goes down.
00:32:56,00:32:58,"It's better to land than be like, oh, we're okay."
00:32:58,00:33:00,"But sir, there are no sheep on board."
00:33:00,00:33:01,It's fine.
00:33:01,00:33:03,It's always the fine animals.
00:33:03,00:33:06,"In 2014, it was the fire alarm, not the smoker alarm, and I think it was caused by the cows"
00:33:06,00:33:07,overheating.
00:33:07,00:33:08,Wow.
00:33:08,00:33:09,"Oh, no, the heat sensor."
00:33:09,00:33:10,"Yeah, exactly."
00:33:10,00:33:13,And they thought it was a fire and they landed in case it was.
00:33:13,00:33:18,"In 2012, a plane had to make a landing after a call broke out of someone's hand luggage."
00:33:18,00:33:19,"Oh, there we are."
00:33:19,00:33:20,Yeah.
00:33:20,00:33:22,"And it bit its owner and escaped and they were like, oh, I'm fine, I'm fine."
00:33:22,00:33:24,"They're like, you need to go off the plane now."
00:33:24,00:33:29,"If someone didn't quote Samuel Jackson at that moment, that is the greatest travesty"
00:33:29,00:33:30,ever known to man.
00:33:30,00:33:31,Okay.
00:33:31,00:33:32,What about maggots on a plane?
00:33:32,00:33:33,Do you see that?
00:33:33,00:33:35,There's sort of mini snakes.
00:33:35,00:33:36,Go on.
00:33:36,00:33:41,This was a US Airways flight at Lanter Airport.
00:33:41,00:33:46,"It wasn't allowed to take off, actually, because maggots started falling out of the overhead"
00:33:46,00:33:47,compartments.
00:33:47,00:33:48,"Oh, my god."
00:33:48,00:33:49,"Oh, my god."
00:33:49,00:33:54,Someone had left a container of old meat and it caused a delay.
00:33:54,00:33:57,This was a flight to Charlotte.
00:33:57,00:34:01,"And someone said that there was only one maggot landed on that, but she felt like they were"
00:34:01,00:34:05,crawling all over me because it only takes one maggot to upset your world.
00:34:05,00:34:08,I don't think it's fair.
00:34:08,00:34:13,"And as they're telling us to stay calm and seated, I see a maggot looking back at me and"
00:34:13,00:34:19,"I'm thinking, these are anaerobic Fleshy Tiglavi that the flight attendants don't have"
00:34:19,00:34:20,to sit with.
00:34:20,00:34:23,But I like that thought that they're anaerobic.
00:34:23,00:34:24,Yeah.
00:34:24,00:34:25,Yeah.
00:34:25,00:34:26,Was she a chemist?
00:34:26,00:34:27,I don't know.
00:34:27,00:34:29,I think these are bloody maggots.
00:34:29,00:34:30,Get me off.
00:34:30,00:34:31,They're moving my seat.
00:34:31,00:34:33,"They're just fly larvae, though."
00:34:33,00:34:34,Not just.
00:34:34,00:34:35,They are anaerobic fly larvae.
00:34:35,00:34:36,"Oh, that's a very good point."
00:34:36,00:34:37,I hadn't considered that.
00:34:37,00:34:38,All right.
00:34:38,00:34:43,There was a flight got rounded for human flatulence in 2006 after a lady was farting on
00:34:43,00:34:48,"a plane, but she was a bit embarrassed and to get rid of the smell, she lit a match."
00:34:48,00:34:50,She really shouldn't do on planes.
00:34:50,00:34:52,"In the blue compartment, can't you?"
00:34:52,00:34:53,No.
00:34:53,00:34:54,They're very clear.
00:34:54,00:34:56,You're not allowed to light anything in the blue.
00:34:56,00:34:57,I've got smoke sensors.
00:34:57,00:34:58,I know.
00:34:58,00:34:59,"But that's to stop people smoking cigarettes, isn't it?"
00:34:59,00:35:02,"Yeah, you're not supposed to be lighting matches in a pressurised environment."
00:35:02,00:35:04,I think people smell sulfur.
00:35:04,00:35:08,"I've been getting away with it for years and years, and I always have a joystick on a plane"
00:35:08,00:35:11,to calm myself down.
00:35:11,00:35:17,"Well, here's a headline from March 2015, ""BA flight forced to land early because of"
00:35:17,00:35:18,"smelly poo."""
00:35:18,00:35:24,"Well, the flight to Dubai from Heathrow, and one passenger said, ""We knew something was"
00:35:24,00:35:25,a bit odd.
00:35:25,00:35:28,"About ten minutes later, the pilot said, 'You may have noticed there's quite a pundit"
00:35:28,00:35:30,smell coming from one of the toilets.'
00:35:30,00:35:33,"He said it was liquid, fecal, excrement."
00:35:33,00:35:34,"Those are the words he used."""
00:35:34,00:35:39,"He said, ""I'm coming from the passenger and I'm in profile."""
00:35:39,00:35:43,"But the plane was in the air for 30 minutes, and then got turned around, had to go back to"
00:35:43,00:35:48,"Heathrow, because apparently it was a risk because they only recycle half the air, and"
00:35:48,00:35:49,"this was so smelly, apparently."
00:35:49,00:35:54,"It was 15 hours until the next flight left, and they had to all stay overnight."
00:35:54,00:35:56,It wasn't like they had to wait that long for the smell to go.
00:35:56,00:35:59,I think I'd leave it for 15 hours.
00:35:59,00:36:01,I think they destroyed the plane in the end.
00:36:01,00:36:02,That's very good.
00:36:02,00:36:09,"I was on the plane recently, and I was chatting to the ex and he was asked, because it was"
00:36:09,00:36:14,"quite late, and I ordered a toasting, and I saw how'd you this hand signal to the person"
00:36:14,00:36:16,"at the other end of the plane, like a crocodile, and I said, ""Oh, what's that?"""
00:36:16,00:36:20,"And she said, ""It's because one person's at the front doing the food and one's taking"
00:36:20,00:36:23,"the orders down the plane, and rather than yelling, they have hand signals."""
00:36:23,00:36:27,"So toasty is a crocodile, because it's like a crock of a show in France."
00:36:27,00:36:31,"A smiley face, holding your hand and make a smile, is this cheese sandwich, cheesy, great."
00:36:31,00:36:32,"Oh, no."
00:36:32,00:36:35,"Sapping your shoulder is chips, because chip on the shoulder."
00:36:35,00:36:36,Right.
00:36:36,00:36:37,Even a whole system.
00:36:37,00:36:38,What's the signal for those in India?
00:36:38,00:36:40,I was put in the toilet.
00:36:40,00:36:45,"So they transported horses to the Olympics in Rio this year, and the race horses got"
00:36:45,00:36:47,more leg rooms than your standard horse transports.
00:36:47,00:36:48,Oh.
00:36:48,00:36:49,I learned.
00:36:49,00:36:50,Yeah.
00:36:50,00:36:53,"So usually it's three horses to a cabin, and these ones were two, because they're special"
00:36:53,00:36:56,horses with special talents who deserve business class treatment.
00:36:56,00:36:58,That is so unegalitarian.
00:36:58,00:36:59,Exactly.
00:36:59,00:37:05,But they also pilot more carefully with horses than with people.
00:37:05,00:37:08,"They don't do, normally, we get pilots doing loop-to-loop, so."
00:37:08,00:37:10,And the horses just hate that.
00:37:10,00:37:15,"No, it's not more carefully, but they do more gradual take-offs and landings, so they spend"
00:37:15,00:37:16,much longer on take-off and landing.
00:37:16,00:37:20,They don't do it as steeply so that the deceleration acceleration isn't as much because
00:37:20,00:37:21,horses get...
00:37:21,00:37:24,"I don't like horses because you can't explain to a horse, okay, you're going to go in a plane"
00:37:24,00:37:25,now.
00:37:25,00:37:26,Where is the humans?
00:37:26,00:37:27,We know what's going on.
00:37:27,00:37:31,A plane operated by the airline FlyB was first a turn back after a B became stuck in one
00:37:31,00:37:32,of its instruments.
00:37:32,00:37:33,A B.
00:37:33,00:37:35,Is that true?
00:37:35,00:37:36,Yeah.
00:37:36,00:37:37,What which instrument?
00:37:37,00:37:39,What instrument on a plane is so sensitive?
00:37:39,00:37:42,"Well, they're all important, I imagine."
00:37:42,00:37:44,"But B's can't do too much damage, can they?"
00:37:44,00:37:47,"It was like sitting on a button that was crucial, and you thought he'd press it, you'll"
00:37:47,00:37:48,get stung.
00:37:48,00:37:49,Sitting on a button.
00:37:49,00:37:52,"Oh, maybe it was."
00:37:52,00:37:53,Lower the landing gear.
00:37:53,00:37:54,I can't.
00:37:54,00:37:57,It's a peak.
00:37:57,00:38:01,A cock-pie-loving man caused a minor alert at Manchester airport when he tried to carry
00:38:01,00:38:03,one through security.
00:38:03,00:38:11,"Apparently, the juice inside the pie set off the kind of thing that was looking for liquids."
00:38:11,00:38:15,The people in security said it must have been a very juicy pie.
00:38:15,00:38:18,"But we've all got liquid in us, so why don't we set off the alarm?"
00:38:18,00:38:19,That is a great point.
00:38:19,00:38:20,You're right.
00:38:20,00:38:22,I'm not sure you're quite as juicy as a cock-pie.
00:38:22,00:38:23,No.
00:38:23,00:38:25,"Don't be insane, James."
00:38:25,00:38:27,Nobody's as juicy as a good pork pie.
00:38:27,00:38:34,Anyone would think that this was just a made-up story by a tap like he's paid for.
00:38:34,00:38:35,We should end.
