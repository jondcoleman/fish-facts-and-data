00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.520
 Hello and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish Presents International Factbowl".

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:12.480
 This is a football podcast, probably the only one out there that makes absolutely no mention of football whatsoever.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.260
 Brought to you by the QILs in association with VisitingLin.com.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:27.800
 My name is Dan, I'm sitting here with James and Anna, and we have a special guest today, which is Alex Edelmond, our comedian friend who's had a lot of Twitter interest in getting you back onto the podcast.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:36.440
 But popular demand from his mum, so today's match is USA vs Russia, and we begin with the USA.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.440
 Alex, you must have some USA facts.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.880
 I have plenty of USA facts.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:49.760
 Oh my god, we've actually got a bit of a proper personal battle going on today, because James, your wife, Polina is Russian, and Alex, you...

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:56.560
 Are from the greatest country on the planet, so there we go, so this is going to be interesting. How do you want it? Come on, first killer fact about America.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.840
 All right, my first killer fact about America is that...

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.000
 They lost the Cold War.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.200
 Um, you don't like it?

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.640
 But one the space war.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:15.200
 So, my first killer fact about America is that there was something called the Great Rraft, which was a series of log jams, several hundred miles long, started in the 1100s.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.440
 How does... I can't even visualize that, how that would work.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:26.520
 Well, I think it's interesting to imagine, because obviously nobody was around, or maybe there were Native Americans around, but a bunch of dead trees clogged up a river.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:42.640
 And kept piling backwards and backwards and backwards and backwards, and eventually there was just this thing, and there are a lot of invasive species that were carried by that river overflowing its banks into little lakes that don't belong there, that are only there because this giant dam flooded these plains in Louisiana.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.440
 That's brilliant.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.040
 Everything's bigger in America, isn't it?

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.480
 Especially our log jams.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:57.920
 No, since you mentioned logs, what is your thing with log cabins in America, and why does so many presidents claim to have been born in them? I don't even... I think seven US presidents were born in log cabins, weren't they?

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.120
 Yeah, pretty sure that Washington wasn't.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.120
 No, Washington wasn't.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.840
 But it was a myth, wasn't it, that he...

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.400
 Oh, yeah, there was definitely a myth here, so I think we'll say 10 people. I think it's seven, most reliably.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:14.360
 What I do know is that before they invented log cabins, or before they had log cabins in America, they all lived in sod huts.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:26.720
 But it was a big thing, there was symbolism to it, and Adley Stevenson, who ran for president against Dwight Eisenhower, he said, "I wasn't born in a log cabin, I wasn't raised in one, and there's no use trying to pretend that I was."

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.840
 And he lost in a goddamn landslide to Dwight Eisenhower.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.400
 Oh, my God, absolutely.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.080
 But it was a symbol of self-building and pioneerism, and it was a really, really potent American thing.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:45.120
 Do you think at the time when he made that speech that all of his team knew that he'd just lost the election?

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.040
 Did he go back with the next speech?

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.560
 I should have had it with my parents, and it turns out that I was actually born in a live screw that I'm totally, was born in a log cabin.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:04.800
 Yeah, there's a similar thing, I know we're not going into Russia yet, but in Russia, you get a lot of people who said that they were sons of coblers, and usually it just means that they had a very poor background and then built themselves up.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.360
 Okay, I know we're not talking about Russia yet, but...

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.400
 Oh, it's good, it's a good tease for the second half of the match.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.560
 12% of all the Coca-Cola in America is drunk at breakfast.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.480
 What?

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.120
 Get out of town, really?

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.120
 That's amazing.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.640
 That is incredible.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.720
 And Americans eat enough peanut butter in a year to coat the floor of the Grand Canyon.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.320
 What, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, how thick?

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.720
 The coating of the floor is probably quite 1 nanometer thick or something, I don't know.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.200
 Yeah, I don't love these.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.840
 Like, it would stretch to the moon.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.480
 Facts.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.160
 Yeah, it's true.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.160
 Because that's a distance and you can make things really thin.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.880
 Like, that's not, you wouldn't want to eat that.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:42.400
 It's true.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.840
 All right, do you know where Jimmy Hendrix's first gig was?

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.240
 Seattle, was it in Seattle?

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.920
 Yeah, it was and where was it?

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.040
 Pikesplakes Market.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.560
 No, he was in a synagogue.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.400
 Was that a synagogue?

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.240
 It was in a synagogue.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.120
 Do you like that?

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.680
 Alex is Jewish, you can probably hear it.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.520
 He's a...

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.840
 It was in the Temple de Hirsch synagogue in Seattle.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.520
 And his bandmates fired him between sets because he was playing too wildly.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.480
 That makes me think synagogues are so much more fun than churches.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.440
 Well, no, they fired him immediately.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.040
 At least he went.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.160
 That is incredible. That is so cool.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.840
 Hey, Pam Lincoln, before we came,

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.800
 President was a licensed bartender, wasn't he?

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:18.680
 Yes.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.280
 That's pretty cool.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.120
 Isn't he...

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.840
 Am I right in saying he was a wrestler as well?

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.280
 Yeah, he's in the wrestling call of fame.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.720
 What, like, next to Hulk Hogan?

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.720
 Come on, that is fantastic.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.960
 If he is, did he have the wrestling name?

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:29.320
 No.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.200
 The beard, like...

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.320
 Four-score.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.400
 I think they put him in later down the line

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.520
 when they realized that he liked wrestling.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.880
 And they said, "Well, he was an early guy who we've heard of,

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.080
 who liked wrestling, so we'll put him in the hall of fame."

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.400
 But he was a big guy, wasn't he?

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.760
 Yeah, he was really... How tall was he?

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.080
 Six foot five or something?

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.080
 Something like that, yeah.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.000
 We are approaching half-time, by the way.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 Yeah, so we're gonna...

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.040
 So soon. Such a big... Such a big country.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.400
 So many facts.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.040
 So if anyone's got any either want to chuck in as a last minute.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.080
 One in 50 Americans executed for murder had the middle name Wayne.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.320
 Don't hang out with Wayne's.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.680
 Yeah, here's another guy.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.880
 E. Berry Wall, he was a guy who popularized wearing tuxedos.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.280
 And he was very satirely elegant and wore wonderful, wonderful clothes.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.760
 And people wrote newspaper articles about him.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.520
 But then another newspaper wrote articles about another guy called Bob Hillard.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.120
 And so these two men who were supposed to be fashion icons

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.600
 had a bit of a fashion duel where they wore more, more amazing clothes.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.760
 And eventually, E. Berry Wall won when he turned up to a party

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.600
 in a pair of black leather boots that went all the way up to his hips.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.200
 And from then on, they called him the King of Dudes.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.280
 King of Dudes. I like it.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.880
 And that title remained until...

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.040
 Until Dan Schreiber came on the scene.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.520
 Yep.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.480
 You can't see right now, but I'm wearing boots right up to my nose.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.600
 You guys know which president gave his name to a footballer?

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.760
 Was it Cristiano Ronaldo's name after Ronald Reagan?

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.320
 Really?

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.520
 His mom was a big fan.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.160
 Oh, wow.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.240
 Was it you that told me that his advisor was called Donald Reagan?

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.960
 Yeah.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:01.440
 Yeah.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.480
 The great chief of staff.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.960
 Ronald Reagan's chief of staff with Donald Reagan.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.200
 But Ronald Reagan, she was a fan of him as an actor

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.000
 rather than a president.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.640
 Yes.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.640
 Okay, Alex, one last fact.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.840
 We're going to go to halftime.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.320
 America's done quite well here, but I really feel like you can just...

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.920
 Devils hold pop fish.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:16.640
 Okay, what's that?

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:23.920
 It is a species of fish that exists completely in one tiny pond

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.040
 in a place called Devil's Hole Nevada that is no bigger than this table.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.040
 And this is not a big table.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.040
 And it was discovered and used as evidence in a court to try to make sure

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.640
 that oil people couldn't prey on this kind of land.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:40.240
 And since then, since we discovered that we've been slowly wiping them out

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.240
 by trying to observe them scientifically

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.320
 and move them to other places.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.080
 But yeah, it's one tiny genetically specific fish to this one.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:48.800
 So this one, Mike?

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.440
 That's already cool.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.120
 I wanted to like it called Devil's Hole as well.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:51.920
 It's a nice name.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:52.960
 Yeah, Devil's Hole Park.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.240
 1,431 Americans live in a town called Elephant, but...

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.040
 Just throwing it out there.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.160
 Poor Elephant.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.160
 There's a place in New Mexico called Truth and Consequences.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.720
 Okay, there's the halftime whistle.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:07.680
 Well done, America.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:08.720
 Very strong.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.240
 Very strong half of you there, Alex.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.800
 I feel like we could have done better,

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.160
 but I'm confident that we'll pull it out.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:14.640
 Okay.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.680
 Okay, before we get to the second half of our match,

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.560
 there's our halftime show which comes in the form of a quiz

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.800
 brought to you by VisitingLin.com.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.800
 And we've got three questions for you this time.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:25.920
 James, first question.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.480
 Okay, my question is, in 1458,

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.280
 there was an event in London called Love Day.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.400
 What did it entail?

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.200
 Okay, murder.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.160
 It's always murder, isn't it?

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:38.800
 Yeah, maybe.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.400
 Well, you'll find out after the show.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.920
 What kind of festivals do you go to?

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.760
 If it's before 1700, it's either a fire or a murder.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.800
 You should be a history teacher.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:49.280
 All right.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.160
 Chazinski.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.920
 Uh, in 19th century England, uh, for what was it,

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.520
 bitch the pot slang?

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.480
 What did it mean?

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.280
 Okay.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.760
 Uh, and Alex, last question.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:04.960
 Um, what famous English event began as a fundraiser for a swimming pool?

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.600
 Was it a murder?

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.200
 Was it a fire?

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.280
 Was it a chiselhampton annual swimming pool fundraiser?

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:15.120
 I love that one.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.640
 I don't know how famous that is.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.240
 All right, well, if you want to find out the answers to those questions,

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.400
 you can hear them at the end of our podcast.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.480
 But in the meantime, let's head back to the match

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.040
 and it's the second half, Russia.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.600
 Russia, here we go.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.360
 James, get on it now.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.160
 What?

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:32.480
 What, really?

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:33.520
 This is your team, James?

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:34.160
 This is you.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.360
 I'm English.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.240
 I've got a good fact.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.560
 Uh, I was just thinking about you being married.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.720
 Uh, Palena is Russian.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:43.280
 I suddenly remembered that there was that fact about how they

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:48.800
 altered female Russian spies in the war by the fact that when they were giving birth,

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.160
 they would yell in Russian as opposed to English.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.200
 And that was the giveaway.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:53.840
 Was that true?

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:54.800
 Is that a true fact?

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:55.680
 No, it's not true.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.640
 That's a really good question.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:01.200
 We were told this by a guy who used to work on QI call Vitaly Vitaliev,

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.160
 who was Russian and he'd found it in his research.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.960
 I'd never found any evidence for it, but I had no reason to doubt him.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:07.920
 Yeah, that's great, isn't it?

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.640
 So that she would live an American life was a double agent.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.320
 And then as she was giving birth,

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.720
 suddenly, Russian swear words coming out.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.320
 Yeah, Russia is a big place.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.560
 It's the size of Pluto.

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:19.600
 No, yeah.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.640
 What Latin Pluto out and stick it on the earth,

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.320
 it'll be about the size of Russia.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.360
 Oh my god.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.520
 Siberia, if Siberia was a country,

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:30.240
 it would still be the largest country in the world by landmass.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.760
 An America's biggest state used to be Russian.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:34.480
 Oh, Alaska.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:34.960
 Alaska.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.080
 Of course.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:39.120
 Actually, Russia did have an area called Russian America.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.320
 They conquered the Kodiac Islands in the 18th century

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.640
 and they called that area Russian America.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.240
 That wouldn't have gone down well today, would it?

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:46.800
 No.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:47.840
 No.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:52.240
 Until 1885, in Russia, Vodka was only sold in buckets.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.640
 And that was the size of 12.3 liters.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:55.920
 Wow.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.120
 That's the only size you could buy.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.560
 That's really good.

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.000
 Wow, that's impressive.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:00.720
 That's amazing.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.000
 Well, they've still got a strong,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.400
 a strong Vodka drinking tradition, haven't they?

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:08.560
 In 1995, Boris Yeltsin was on a trip to the White House,

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:12.000
 visiting the president and he was found drunk in his underwear

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.240
 outside the White House in the middle of the night.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.640
 He was discovered by the US Secret Service

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.440
 and all he did was slurge them that he was looking for pizza.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.600
 Really?

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.080
 Yeah.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.240
 Catherine the Great.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:24.640
 Oh, yeah.

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:28.320
 The Russian Empress Catherine the Great.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.720
 I'm sure it's not going to be the fact you're thinking of Alex

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:31.680
 because that's not true.

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:35.360
 Well, I found interesting about her is that she wasn't called Catherine.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.480
 That wasn't her name.

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.240
 And she hated being called the Great.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:39.280
 Really?

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.920
 So when you put all three of those words together,

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.080
 that was a nightmare for her whole life.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.800
 So why is everyone calling me Catherine for starters?

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:47.200
 Yeah.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.200
 What was she called you Catherine?

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.720
 Well, she was born Sophie.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.280
 Oh, was she?

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:51.760
 Yeah.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:52.240
 Wow.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.840
 Sophie Friedricha.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.920
 Sophie the Not That Great.

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:59.040
 Yeah, Sophie the All Right is probably what she'd go for.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.600
 So as well as hating her name,

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.920
 she hated the fact that she had rickets,

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.760
 which is, you know, the disease rickets.

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:06.800
 Yeah, more understandable.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:11.200
 And so what they wanted to do was find someone who could treat her

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:15.280
 and they couldn't find anyone in their town who was good enough to do it,

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:16.960
 but they eventually did find someone.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:22.400
 And it was the town's executioner who eventually became her, I guess, personal doctor.

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.560
 They'll kill you of rickets if you chop someone's head off.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:25.840
 Yeah, exactly.

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.400
 So this is what he ordered.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:32.480
 This was his medication that her back and shoulders

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:35.920
 should be rubbed every day with the saliva of a servant girl.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:40.880
 Oh, who was under instructions, not to eat anything beforehand.

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.280
 I don't know how much beforehand means.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.280
 How do you reckon they got the saliva off her?

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.440
 Like they made her not eat anything beforehand

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.440
 and then put something that smelled really nice,

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.560
 like some bacon in front of her.

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:51.680
 Yeah, she was like.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.840
 She was like Homer Simpson.

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.320
 Wow, that's amazing.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:56.960
 I have a question.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:57.520
 Thank you.

00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:58.320
 Go on.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.400
 Anyone know about the TP82?

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:01.280
 I do not.

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:05.040
 It is a smooth bore, triple-barreled, Soviet fire arm,

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.480
 which was carried by cosmonauts on space missions

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.440
 in case they encountered aliens

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.040
 or landed in hostile territory.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:13.440
 Yeah.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.720
 There was more for landing in hostile territory.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.040
 I think what it was more for was when they landed in Russia,

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:17.840
 there might be bears.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.120
 Really?

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.240
 I understand that, to be right.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:20.480
 Yeah.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.480
 I thought it was in case they landed in a place

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.920
 that wasn't friendly to Russians.

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:25.280
 Could be that it would be that as well.

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:26.320
 Yeah, yeah.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.320
 Does anyone have any interesting cosmonauts?

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.800
 I have one, which we've had on QI years ago,

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.880
 but it was my favorite fact that I found,

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:36.560
 because it was amidst some data though, it was looking at,

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.280
 which is that the first Earthling to go around the moon

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:42.160
 wasn't the Apollo 8 astronauts from America.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.040
 It was a Russian.

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.320
 And it was a Russian tortoise.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.840
 And it was in the Zond 5.

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.720
 And it went around the moon months before Apollo 8 got there.

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.080
 So the first Earthling,

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.760
 and in terms of the space race,

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:57.760
 that's quite a message to send what is some sea metaphorically

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.840
 as the slowest animal ever.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.000
 Did he make it back?

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.120
 Yeah, he did, and it's possible that with the life expectancy

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:08.400
 of that particular type of tortoise that it's still alive.

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.640
 Well, you know what?

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:11.840
 Buzz Aldrin's still alive.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.600
 So I'll take him over the tortoise.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:14.080
 Yeah, sure.

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:18.720
 On cosmonauts, so Yuri Gagarin, the Russians love him.

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:19.840
 Really, really proud of him, right?

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:24.000
 And he inadvertently started a tradition

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.160
 when, on his way to become the first guy in space,

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.280
 he was taking the shuttle bus to the takeoff point

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:32.720
 and stopped for a pit stop to we on the back tire of the bus.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:35.760
 And now every single Russian mission into space,

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.760
 they stopped the bus and all the men get out,

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:38.560
 all the astronauts get out.

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.000
 That's right, that's true.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.080
 When Neil Armstrong died,

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.560
 the Russian news agencies were saying,

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.880
 "Of course, Neil Armstrong was a nice man,

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:49.760
 but he was no one near as good as a great Gagarin."

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:50.640
 Nice.

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:52.160
 Yeah, a nice man.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.240
 Dammit. First of all, he wasn't a nice guy.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:58.720
 Okay, we are vastly approaching the end of our match.

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:00.640
 James, we, uh...

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.360
 You want my absolute biggest greatest fact?

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.240
 Yeah.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:04.960
 Are you ready?

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.160
 Yeah, let's do this.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.520
 65% of Russia is covered in permafrost.

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:11.920
 What?

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.440
 Is that a type of peanut butter?

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.480
 No, no, really.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.360
 No, my favorite thing is going to be Lake Baikal in Siberia.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.040
 Like, that is such an amazing place.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:22.240
 It's a thousand times older than any other lake on Earth.

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.160
 And even if all the rest of the water on Earth

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.240
 disappeared, there would still be enough fresh water

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:30.000
 in Lake Baikal to keep the world's population going for 50 years.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.240
 That is incredible.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.360
 Yeah, that is good.

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:34.240
 That is very good.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:37.280
 Okay, that's the end of our match.

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:38.480
 That was, that was big.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.000
 Before we find out who's won, though,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.360
 let's quickly get the answers to our visiting land.com quiz.

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:45.520
 And we started with a question from you, James.

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:46.400
 Yes, we did.

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:52.720
 My question was about the event in 1458 called Love Day in London.

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:56.320
 And this was a match with the Lankastrians and the Yorkists

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:59.040
 from the War of the Roses to show how much they all

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.440
 still liked each other and weren't going to go to war.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:04.480
 And 18 months later, they were back at it.

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:07.280
 So I didn't really work.

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:08.000
 Didn't work.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:08.880
 Ah, damn.

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:16.160
 My question was what did bitch the pot mean in 19th century English slang?

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.240
 And it meant poverty.

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:18.880
 Pore the tea.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:19.440
 Pore the tea.

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.160
 You could bring that back.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.160
 It's like a Snoop Dogg.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.520
 Would you like a cup of tea?

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:24.800
 Yeah, exactly.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.160
 That's a good name for a song.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:26.640
 Bitch.

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:27.200
 And if I let's pop?

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:30.720
 Okay, last question, Alex.

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:33.680
 My question was which famous English event

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.000
 began as a fundraiser for a swimming pool?

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.840
 It was the Isle of White Music Festival.

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:40.160
 Really?

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:40.800
 The Isle of White?

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:44.080
 At the annual major music festival?

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:44.800
 Yes.

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.000
 The big music festival.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.320
 I performed at it a couple of weeks ago.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:48.960
 Yes, I did.

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:50.320
 Okay, so that's the end of that quiz.

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:53.280
 If you want to win a prize, though, by any chance,

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:57.120
 you can win some qi goodies by heading over to visit england.com

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:59.680
 where they have hats and t-shirts and books.

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:02.320
 We could get Alex to sign a copy of one of the books.

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.480
 I'm sure you're all keen on that.

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:08.320
 And they might be.

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:12.640
 Okay, but now we need to find out who won today's match.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:16.560
 And because I can't go to either James or Alex to decide,

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.560
 I'm going to have to throw it to you, Anna.

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:22.960
 I'm going to say, Mr. Shriver, tear down this wall

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:24.000
 and make it a draw.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.240
 Neither I nor Alex are happy with that.

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.400
 Another war that ends in a stalemate.

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:33.280
 All right, so we end in a draw.

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:34.320
 My god, okay.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:37.680
 America and Russia going in harmony to the next round.

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:38.800
 Okay, well, that's it.

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.760
 If you want to ask us any questions

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:43.680
 about the stuff that we were talking about,

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:47.040
 if you'd like to bash either America or Russia,

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.040
 you can get us on our Twitter handles.

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:52.000
 Alex @Alex_Edelman.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.320
 And James @XHapes.

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:55.680
 And Anna.

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:57.280
 Oh, it replied to you @Quickipedia

00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:00.080
 or you can email podcast@QI.com.

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.680
 And I'm on @Shriverland.

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:02.880
 That's it for today's match.

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:04.640
 If you would like to join us again tomorrow,

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:05.920
 there's going to be another match.

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:07.360
 And it is James.

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:08.800
 You'll be interested in this down.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:12.480
 It's your home country of Australia against Mexico.

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:13.520
 I don't think we need to do that one.

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.040
 We'll just put Australia straight through

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.720
 and we'll just continue on with the next match.

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.280
 I have been researching some amazing Mexico facts

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.160
 so you could be in trouble.

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:21.680
 No, I've got Aussie covered.

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.760
 Okay, so that's it for us today.

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:26.400
 Come back tomorrow and watch me whip the crap

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:28.160
 out of James' Mexico facts.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:29.120
 We'll see you then.

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:29.760
 Goodbye.

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:30.720
 USA!

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:31.720
 USA!
