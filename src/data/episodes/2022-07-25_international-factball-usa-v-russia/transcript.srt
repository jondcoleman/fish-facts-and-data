00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,520
 Hello and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish Presents International Factbowl".

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:12,480
 This is a football podcast, probably the only one out there that makes absolutely no mention of football whatsoever.

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,260
 Brought to you by the QILs in association with VisitingLin.com.

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:27,800
 My name is Dan, I'm sitting here with James and Anna, and we have a special guest today, which is Alex Edelmond, our comedian friend who's had a lot of Twitter interest in getting you back onto the podcast.

5
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:36,440
 But popular demand from his mum, so today's match is USA vs Russia, and we begin with the USA.

6
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,440
 Alex, you must have some USA facts.

7
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,880
 I have plenty of USA facts.

8
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:49,760
 Oh my god, we've actually got a bit of a proper personal battle going on today, because James, your wife, Polina is Russian, and Alex, you...

9
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:56,560
 Are from the greatest country on the planet, so there we go, so this is going to be interesting. How do you want it? Come on, first killer fact about America.

10
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,840
 All right, my first killer fact about America is that...

11
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,000
 They lost the Cold War.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,200
 Um, you don't like it?

13
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,640
 But one the space war.

14
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:15,200
 So, my first killer fact about America is that there was something called the Great Rraft, which was a series of log jams, several hundred miles long, started in the 1100s.

15
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,440
 How does... I can't even visualize that, how that would work.

16
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:26,520
 Well, I think it's interesting to imagine, because obviously nobody was around, or maybe there were Native Americans around, but a bunch of dead trees clogged up a river.

17
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:42,640
 And kept piling backwards and backwards and backwards and backwards, and eventually there was just this thing, and there are a lot of invasive species that were carried by that river overflowing its banks into little lakes that don't belong there, that are only there because this giant dam flooded these plains in Louisiana.

18
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,440
 That's brilliant.

19
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,040
 Everything's bigger in America, isn't it?

20
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,480
 Especially our log jams.

21
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:57,920
 No, since you mentioned logs, what is your thing with log cabins in America, and why does so many presidents claim to have been born in them? I don't even... I think seven US presidents were born in log cabins, weren't they?

22
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,120
 Yeah, pretty sure that Washington wasn't.

23
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,120
 No, Washington wasn't.

24
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,840
 But it was a myth, wasn't it, that he...

25
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,400
 Oh, yeah, there was definitely a myth here, so I think we'll say 10 people. I think it's seven, most reliably.

26
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:14,360
 What I do know is that before they invented log cabins, or before they had log cabins in America, they all lived in sod huts.

27
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:26,720
 But it was a big thing, there was symbolism to it, and Adley Stevenson, who ran for president against Dwight Eisenhower, he said, "I wasn't born in a log cabin, I wasn't raised in one, and there's no use trying to pretend that I was."

28
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,840
 And he lost in a goddamn landslide to Dwight Eisenhower.

29
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,400
 Oh, my God, absolutely.

30
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:39,080
 But it was a symbol of self-building and pioneerism, and it was a really, really potent American thing.

31
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:45,120
 Do you think at the time when he made that speech that all of his team knew that he'd just lost the election?

32
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,040
 Did he go back with the next speech?

33
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:53,560
 I should have had it with my parents, and it turns out that I was actually born in a live screw that I'm totally, was born in a log cabin.

34
00:02:53,560 --> 00:03:04,800
 Yeah, there's a similar thing, I know we're not going into Russia yet, but in Russia, you get a lot of people who said that they were sons of coblers, and usually it just means that they had a very poor background and then built themselves up.

35
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,360
 Okay, I know we're not talking about Russia yet, but...

36
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,400
 Oh, it's good, it's a good tease for the second half of the match.

37
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,560
 12% of all the Coca-Cola in America is drunk at breakfast.

38
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,480
 What?

39
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,120
 Get out of town, really?

40
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,120
 That's amazing.

41
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,640
 That is incredible.

42
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,720
 And Americans eat enough peanut butter in a year to coat the floor of the Grand Canyon.

43
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,320
 What, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, how thick?

44
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,720
 The coating of the floor is probably quite 1 nanometer thick or something, I don't know.

45
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,200
 Yeah, I don't love these.

46
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,840
 Like, it would stretch to the moon.

47
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,480
 Facts.

48
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,160
 Yeah, it's true.

49
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,160
 Because that's a distance and you can make things really thin.

50
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,880
 Like, that's not, you wouldn't want to eat that.

51
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,400
 It's true.

52
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,840
 All right, do you know where Jimmy Hendrix's first gig was?

53
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,240
 Seattle, was it in Seattle?

54
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,920
 Yeah, it was and where was it?

55
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,040
 Pikesplakes Market.

56
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,560
 No, he was in a synagogue.

57
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,400
 Was that a synagogue?

58
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,240
 It was in a synagogue.

59
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,120
 Do you like that?

60
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,680
 Alex is Jewish, you can probably hear it.

61
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,520
 He's a...

62
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:01,840
 It was in the Temple de Hirsch synagogue in Seattle.

63
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,520
 And his bandmates fired him between sets because he was playing too wildly.

64
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,480
 That makes me think synagogues are so much more fun than churches.

65
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,440
 Well, no, they fired him immediately.

66
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,040
 At least he went.

67
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,160
 That is incredible. That is so cool.

68
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,840
 Hey, Pam Lincoln, before we came,

69
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,800
 President was a licensed bartender, wasn't he?

70
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,680
 Yes.

71
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,280
 That's pretty cool.

72
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,120
 Isn't he...

73
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,840
 Am I right in saying he was a wrestler as well?

74
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,280
 Yeah, he's in the wrestling call of fame.

75
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,720
 What, like, next to Hulk Hogan?

76
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,720
 Come on, that is fantastic.

77
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,960
 If he is, did he have the wrestling name?

78
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,320
 No.

79
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,200
 The beard, like...

80
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,320
 Four-score.

81
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,400
 I think they put him in later down the line

82
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,520
 when they realized that he liked wrestling.

83
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,880
 And they said, "Well, he was an early guy who we've heard of,

84
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,080
 who liked wrestling, so we'll put him in the hall of fame."

85
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,400
 But he was a big guy, wasn't he?

86
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,760
 Yeah, he was really... How tall was he?

87
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,080
 Six foot five or something?

88
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,080
 Something like that, yeah.

89
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,000
 We are approaching half-time, by the way.

90
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Yeah, so we're gonna...

91
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,040
 So soon. Such a big... Such a big country.

92
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,400
 So many facts.

93
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,040
 So if anyone's got any either want to chuck in as a last minute.

94
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,080
 One in 50 Americans executed for murder had the middle name Wayne.

95
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,320
 Don't hang out with Wayne's.

96
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,680
 Yeah, here's another guy.

97
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,880
 E. Berry Wall, he was a guy who popularized wearing tuxedos.

98
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,280
 And he was very satirely elegant and wore wonderful, wonderful clothes.

99
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,760
 And people wrote newspaper articles about him.

100
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,520
 But then another newspaper wrote articles about another guy called Bob Hillard.

101
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,120
 And so these two men who were supposed to be fashion icons

102
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,600
 had a bit of a fashion duel where they wore more, more amazing clothes.

103
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,760
 And eventually, E. Berry Wall won when he turned up to a party

104
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,600
 in a pair of black leather boots that went all the way up to his hips.

105
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,200
 And from then on, they called him the King of Dudes.

106
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,280
 King of Dudes. I like it.

107
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,880
 And that title remained until...

108
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,040
 Until Dan Schreiber came on the scene.

109
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,520
 Yep.

110
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,480
 You can't see right now, but I'm wearing boots right up to my nose.

111
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:51,600
 You guys know which president gave his name to a footballer?

112
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,760
 Was it Cristiano Ronaldo's name after Ronald Reagan?

113
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,320
 Really?

114
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,520
 His mom was a big fan.

115
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,160
 Oh, wow.

116
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,240
 Was it you that told me that his advisor was called Donald Reagan?

117
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:00,960
 Yeah.

118
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,440
 Yeah.

119
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,480
 The great chief of staff.

120
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,960
 Ronald Reagan's chief of staff with Donald Reagan.

121
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,200
 But Ronald Reagan, she was a fan of him as an actor

122
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,000
 rather than a president.

123
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,640
 Yes.

124
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,640
 Okay, Alex, one last fact.

125
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,840
 We're going to go to halftime.

126
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,320
 America's done quite well here, but I really feel like you can just...

127
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,920
 Devils hold pop fish.

128
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,640
 Okay, what's that?

129
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:23,920
 It is a species of fish that exists completely in one tiny pond

130
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,040
 in a place called Devil's Hole Nevada that is no bigger than this table.

131
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,040
 And this is not a big table.

132
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,040
 And it was discovered and used as evidence in a court to try to make sure

133
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,640
 that oil people couldn't prey on this kind of land.

134
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,240
 And since then, since we discovered that we've been slowly wiping them out

135
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,240
 by trying to observe them scientifically

136
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,320
 and move them to other places.

137
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,080
 But yeah, it's one tiny genetically specific fish to this one.

138
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,800
 So this one, Mike?

139
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,440
 That's already cool.

140
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,120
 I wanted to like it called Devil's Hole as well.

141
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,920
 It's a nice name.

142
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,960
 Yeah, Devil's Hole Park.

143
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,240
 1,431 Americans live in a town called Elephant, but...

144
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,040
 Just throwing it out there.

145
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,160
 Poor Elephant.

146
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,160
 There's a place in New Mexico called Truth and Consequences.

147
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,720
 Okay, there's the halftime whistle.

148
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,680
 Well done, America.

149
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,720
 Very strong.

150
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,240
 Very strong half of you there, Alex.

151
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,800
 I feel like we could have done better,

152
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,160
 but I'm confident that we'll pull it out.

153
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,640
 Okay.

154
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,680
 Okay, before we get to the second half of our match,

155
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,560
 there's our halftime show which comes in the form of a quiz

156
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,800
 brought to you by VisitingLin.com.

157
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,800
 And we've got three questions for you this time.

158
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,920
 James, first question.

159
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,480
 Okay, my question is, in 1458,

160
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,280
 there was an event in London called Love Day.

161
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,400
 What did it entail?

162
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,200
 Okay, murder.

163
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,160
 It's always murder, isn't it?

164
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,800
 Yeah, maybe.

165
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,400
 Well, you'll find out after the show.

166
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,920
 What kind of festivals do you go to?

167
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,760
 If it's before 1700, it's either a fire or a murder.

168
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,800
 You should be a history teacher.

169
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,280
 All right.

170
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,160
 Chazinski.

171
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,920
 Uh, in 19th century England, uh, for what was it,

172
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,520
 bitch the pot slang?

173
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,480
 What did it mean?

174
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,280
 Okay.

175
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,760
 Uh, and Alex, last question.

176
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:04,960
 Um, what famous English event began as a fundraiser for a swimming pool?

177
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,600
 Was it a murder?

178
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,200
 Was it a fire?

179
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,280
 Was it a chiselhampton annual swimming pool fundraiser?

180
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,120
 I love that one.

181
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,640
 I don't know how famous that is.

182
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,240
 All right, well, if you want to find out the answers to those questions,

183
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,400
 you can hear them at the end of our podcast.

184
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,480
 But in the meantime, let's head back to the match

185
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,040
 and it's the second half, Russia.

186
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,600
 Russia, here we go.

187
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,360
 James, get on it now.

188
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,160
 What?

189
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:32,480
 What, really?

190
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,520
 This is your team, James?

191
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,160
 This is you.

192
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,360
 I'm English.

193
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,240
 I've got a good fact.

194
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,560
 Uh, I was just thinking about you being married.

195
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,720
 Uh, Palena is Russian.

196
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,280
 I suddenly remembered that there was that fact about how they

197
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:48,800
 altered female Russian spies in the war by the fact that when they were giving birth,

198
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,160
 they would yell in Russian as opposed to English.

199
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,200
 And that was the giveaway.

200
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:53,840
 Was that true?

201
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,800
 Is that a true fact?

202
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,680
 No, it's not true.

203
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,640
 That's a really good question.

204
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,200
 We were told this by a guy who used to work on QI call Vitaly Vitaliev,

205
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,160
 who was Russian and he'd found it in his research.

206
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,960
 I'd never found any evidence for it, but I had no reason to doubt him.

207
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,920
 Yeah, that's great, isn't it?

208
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,640
 So that she would live an American life was a double agent.

209
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,320
 And then as she was giving birth,

210
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,720
 suddenly, Russian swear words coming out.

211
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,320
 Yeah, Russia is a big place.

212
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,560
 It's the size of Pluto.

213
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,600
 No, yeah.

214
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,640
 What Latin Pluto out and stick it on the earth,

215
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,320
 it'll be about the size of Russia.

216
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,360
 Oh my god.

217
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,520
 Siberia, if Siberia was a country,

218
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,240
 it would still be the largest country in the world by landmass.

219
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,760
 An America's biggest state used to be Russian.

220
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,480
 Oh, Alaska.

221
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:34,960
 Alaska.

222
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,080
 Of course.

223
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,120
 Actually, Russia did have an area called Russian America.

224
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,320
 They conquered the Kodiac Islands in the 18th century

225
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,640
 and they called that area Russian America.

226
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,240
 That wouldn't have gone down well today, would it?

227
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:46,800
 No.

228
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,840
 No.

229
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:52,240
 Until 1885, in Russia, Vodka was only sold in buckets.

230
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,640
 And that was the size of 12.3 liters.

231
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,920
 Wow.

232
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,120
 That's the only size you could buy.

233
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,560
 That's really good.

234
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,000
 Wow, that's impressive.

235
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,720
 That's amazing.

236
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,000
 Well, they've still got a strong,

237
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,400
 a strong Vodka drinking tradition, haven't they?

238
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,560
 In 1995, Boris Yeltsin was on a trip to the White House,

239
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,000
 visiting the president and he was found drunk in his underwear

240
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,240
 outside the White House in the middle of the night.

241
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,640
 He was discovered by the US Secret Service

242
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,440
 and all he did was slurge them that he was looking for pizza.

243
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,600
 Really?

244
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,080
 Yeah.

245
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,240
 Catherine the Great.

246
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:24,640
 Oh, yeah.

247
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,320
 The Russian Empress Catherine the Great.

248
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,720
 I'm sure it's not going to be the fact you're thinking of Alex

249
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,680
 because that's not true.

250
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,360
 Well, I found interesting about her is that she wasn't called Catherine.

251
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,480
 That wasn't her name.

252
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,240
 And she hated being called the Great.

253
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,280
 Really?

254
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,920
 So when you put all three of those words together,

255
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,080
 that was a nightmare for her whole life.

256
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,800
 So why is everyone calling me Catherine for starters?

257
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,200
 Yeah.

258
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,200
 What was she called you Catherine?

259
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,720
 Well, she was born Sophie.

260
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,280
 Oh, was she?

261
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:51,760
 Yeah.

262
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,240
 Wow.

263
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,840
 Sophie Friedricha.

264
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,920
 Sophie the Not That Great.

265
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,040
 Yeah, Sophie the All Right is probably what she'd go for.

266
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,600
 So as well as hating her name,

267
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,920
 she hated the fact that she had rickets,

268
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,760
 which is, you know, the disease rickets.

269
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,800
 Yeah, more understandable.

270
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,200
 And so what they wanted to do was find someone who could treat her

271
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,280
 and they couldn't find anyone in their town who was good enough to do it,

272
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,960
 but they eventually did find someone.

273
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:22,400
 And it was the town's executioner who eventually became her, I guess, personal doctor.

274
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,560
 They'll kill you of rickets if you chop someone's head off.

275
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,840
 Yeah, exactly.

276
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,400
 So this is what he ordered.

277
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,480
 This was his medication that her back and shoulders

278
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,920
 should be rubbed every day with the saliva of a servant girl.

279
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,880
 Oh, who was under instructions, not to eat anything beforehand.

280
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,280
 I don't know how much beforehand means.

281
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,280
 How do you reckon they got the saliva off her?

282
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,440
 Like they made her not eat anything beforehand

283
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,440
 and then put something that smelled really nice,

284
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,560
 like some bacon in front of her.

285
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,680
 Yeah, she was like.

286
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,840
 She was like Homer Simpson.

287
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,320
 Wow, that's amazing.

288
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:56,960
 I have a question.

289
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,520
 Thank you.

290
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,320
 Go on.

291
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,400
 Anyone know about the TP82?

292
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,280
 I do not.

293
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:05,040
 It is a smooth bore, triple-barreled, Soviet fire arm,

294
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,480
 which was carried by cosmonauts on space missions

295
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,440
 in case they encountered aliens

296
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,040
 or landed in hostile territory.

297
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,440
 Yeah.

298
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,720
 There was more for landing in hostile territory.

299
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,040
 I think what it was more for was when they landed in Russia,

300
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,840
 there might be bears.

301
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,120
 Really?

302
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,240
 I understand that, to be right.

303
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:20,480
 Yeah.

304
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,480
 I thought it was in case they landed in a place

305
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,920
 that wasn't friendly to Russians.

306
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,280
 Could be that it would be that as well.

307
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,320
 Yeah, yeah.

308
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,320
 Does anyone have any interesting cosmonauts?

309
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,800
 I have one, which we've had on QI years ago,

310
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,880
 but it was my favorite fact that I found,

311
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,560
 because it was amidst some data though, it was looking at,

312
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,280
 which is that the first Earthling to go around the moon

313
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,160
 wasn't the Apollo 8 astronauts from America.

314
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,040
 It was a Russian.

315
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,320
 And it was a Russian tortoise.

316
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,840
 And it was in the Zond 5.

317
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,720
 And it went around the moon months before Apollo 8 got there.

318
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,080
 So the first Earthling,

319
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,760
 and in terms of the space race,

320
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,760
 that's quite a message to send what is some sea metaphorically

321
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,840
 as the slowest animal ever.

322
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,000
 Did he make it back?

323
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,120
 Yeah, he did, and it's possible that with the life expectancy

324
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,400
 of that particular type of tortoise that it's still alive.

325
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,640
 Well, you know what?

326
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,840
 Buzz Aldrin's still alive.

327
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,600
 So I'll take him over the tortoise.

328
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,080
 Yeah, sure.

329
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:18,720
 On cosmonauts, so Yuri Gagarin, the Russians love him.

330
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,840
 Really, really proud of him, right?

331
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:24,000
 And he inadvertently started a tradition

332
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,160
 when, on his way to become the first guy in space,

333
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,280
 he was taking the shuttle bus to the takeoff point

334
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,720
 and stopped for a pit stop to we on the back tire of the bus.

335
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,760
 And now every single Russian mission into space,

336
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,760
 they stopped the bus and all the men get out,

337
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,560
 all the astronauts get out.

338
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,000
 That's right, that's true.

339
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,080
 When Neil Armstrong died,

340
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,560
 the Russian news agencies were saying,

341
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,880
 "Of course, Neil Armstrong was a nice man,

342
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,760
 but he was no one near as good as a great Gagarin."

343
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,640
 Nice.

344
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,160
 Yeah, a nice man.

345
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,240
 Dammit. First of all, he wasn't a nice guy.

346
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,720
 Okay, we are vastly approaching the end of our match.

347
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,640
 James, we, uh...

348
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,360
 You want my absolute biggest greatest fact?

349
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,240
 Yeah.

350
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:04,960
 Are you ready?

351
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,160
 Yeah, let's do this.

352
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,520
 65% of Russia is covered in permafrost.

353
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,920
 What?

354
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,440
 Is that a type of peanut butter?

355
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,480
 No, no, really.

356
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,360
 No, my favorite thing is going to be Lake Baikal in Siberia.

357
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,040
 Like, that is such an amazing place.

358
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,240
 It's a thousand times older than any other lake on Earth.

359
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,160
 And even if all the rest of the water on Earth

360
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,240
 disappeared, there would still be enough fresh water

361
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,000
 in Lake Baikal to keep the world's population going for 50 years.

362
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,240
 That is incredible.

363
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,360
 Yeah, that is good.

364
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,240
 That is very good.

365
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,280
 Okay, that's the end of our match.

366
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,480
 That was, that was big.

367
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,000
 Before we find out who's won, though,

368
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,360
 let's quickly get the answers to our visiting land.com quiz.

369
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,520
 And we started with a question from you, James.

370
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,400
 Yes, we did.

371
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:52,720
 My question was about the event in 1458 called Love Day in London.

372
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,320
 And this was a match with the Lankastrians and the Yorkists

373
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,040
 from the War of the Roses to show how much they all

374
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,440
 still liked each other and weren't going to go to war.

375
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,480
 And 18 months later, they were back at it.

376
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,280
 So I didn't really work.

377
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,000
 Didn't work.

378
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,880
 Ah, damn.

379
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:16,160
 My question was what did bitch the pot mean in 19th century English slang?

380
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,240
 And it meant poverty.

381
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:18,880
 Pore the tea.

382
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,440
 Pore the tea.

383
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,160
 You could bring that back.

384
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,160
 It's like a Snoop Dogg.

385
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,520
 Would you like a cup of tea?

386
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,800
 Yeah, exactly.

387
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,160
 That's a good name for a song.

388
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:26,640
 Bitch.

389
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,200
 And if I let's pop?

390
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,720
 Okay, last question, Alex.

391
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,680
 My question was which famous English event

392
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,000
 began as a fundraiser for a swimming pool?

393
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,840
 It was the Isle of White Music Festival.

394
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,160
 Really?

395
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:40,800
 The Isle of White?

396
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,080
 At the annual major music festival?

397
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,800
 Yes.

398
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,000
 The big music festival.

399
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,320
 I performed at it a couple of weeks ago.

400
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:48,960
 Yes, I did.

401
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,320
 Okay, so that's the end of that quiz.

402
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,280
 If you want to win a prize, though, by any chance,

403
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:57,120
 you can win some qi goodies by heading over to visit england.com

404
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,680
 where they have hats and t-shirts and books.

405
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,320
 We could get Alex to sign a copy of one of the books.

406
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,480
 I'm sure you're all keen on that.

407
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,320
 And they might be.

408
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,640
 Okay, but now we need to find out who won today's match.

409
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:16,560
 And because I can't go to either James or Alex to decide,

410
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,560
 I'm going to have to throw it to you, Anna.

411
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,960
 I'm going to say, Mr. Shriver, tear down this wall

412
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,000
 and make it a draw.

413
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,240
 Neither I nor Alex are happy with that.

414
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,400
 Another war that ends in a stalemate.

415
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,280
 All right, so we end in a draw.

416
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,320
 My god, okay.

417
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,680
 America and Russia going in harmony to the next round.

418
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,800
 Okay, well, that's it.

419
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,760
 If you want to ask us any questions

420
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,680
 about the stuff that we were talking about,

421
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,040
 if you'd like to bash either America or Russia,

422
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,040
 you can get us on our Twitter handles.

423
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,000
 Alex @Alex_Edelman.

424
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,320
 And James @XHapes.

425
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,680
 And Anna.

426
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,280
 Oh, it replied to you @Quickipedia

427
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,080
 or you can email podcast@QI.com.

428
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,680
 And I'm on @Shriverland.

429
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,880
 That's it for today's match.

430
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,640
 If you would like to join us again tomorrow,

431
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,920
 there's going to be another match.

432
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,360
 And it is James.

433
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,800
 You'll be interested in this down.

434
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,480
 It's your home country of Australia against Mexico.

435
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,520
 I don't think we need to do that one.

436
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,040
 We'll just put Australia straight through

437
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,720
 and we'll just continue on with the next match.

438
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,280
 I have been researching some amazing Mexico facts

439
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,160
 so you could be in trouble.

440
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,680
 No, I've got Aussie covered.

441
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,760
 Okay, so that's it for us today.

442
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,400
 Come back tomorrow and watch me whip the crap

443
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,160
 out of James' Mexico facts.

444
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,120
 We'll see you then.

445
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:29,760
 Goodbye.

446
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,720
 USA!

447
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,720
 USA!
