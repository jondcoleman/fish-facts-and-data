00:00:03,00:00:06,"Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Things A Fish,"
00:00:06,00:00:10,where we were joined by the brilliant Maddie Motte.
00:00:10,00:00:14,"Now, if you have children of a certain age,"
00:00:14,00:00:16,then you will know exactly who Maddie is.
00:00:16,00:00:20,"She is often seen on the BBC doing various kid shows,"
00:00:20,00:00:23,especially once related to science communication.
00:00:23,00:00:27,"But if you want to know more about her having heard her today on this show,"
00:00:27,00:00:30,"and I'm absolutely certain you will, then the best thing to do"
00:00:30,00:00:32,is to go to her YouTube channel.
00:00:32,00:00:36,So Maddie's YouTube channel is all about curiosity.
00:00:36,00:00:39,"It's all about animals, about plants, about travel,"
00:00:39,00:00:41,about technology.
00:00:41,00:00:43,She is really right up her street.
00:00:43,00:00:45,"She loves everything about knowledge,"
00:00:45,00:00:47,and her videos are absolutely fantastic.
00:00:47,00:00:48,"And if you want to find them,"
00:00:48,00:00:50,"then go to youtube.com/maddiemote,"
00:00:50,00:00:54,"that's M-A-A-D-I-E-M-O-A-T-E,"
00:00:54,00:00:56,or just search for Maddie's name on the internet.
00:00:56,00:00:59,"If you'd like to learn more about us,"
00:00:59,00:01:01,"and what we're up to at the moment and in the future,"
00:01:01,00:01:04,then the best place probably at the moment is to go to Patreon.

00:01:44,00:01:45,On with the podcast.
00:01:45,00:02:02,[Music]
00:02:02,00:02:06,Hello and welcome to another episode
00:02:06,00:02:07,"of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:02:07,00:02:09,a weekly podcast coming to you
00:02:09,00:02:11,from the QI offices in Hobern.
00:02:11,00:02:12,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:02:12,00:02:14,"I'm sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:02:14,00:02:16,"James Harkin, and Maddie Mote."
00:02:16,00:02:18,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:02:18,00:02:21,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:02:21,00:02:24,"And in a particular order, here we go."
00:02:24,00:02:27,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Maddie."
00:02:27,00:02:31,"Okay, so I thought I could pose this fact as a question,"
00:02:31,00:02:33,sort of a bit of a guessing game.
00:02:33,00:02:36,"So the fact is, in 1988,"
00:02:36,00:02:42,one particular company had to recall 30 million flutes.
00:02:43,00:02:46,That is obviously important.
00:02:46,00:02:47,It's a lot of instruments.
00:02:47,00:02:48,"Yeah, yeah."
00:02:48,00:02:49,"So the question is,"
00:02:49,00:02:50,who is this company?
00:02:50,00:02:51,- Flute makers. - Flute makers.
00:02:51,00:02:53,- Flute makers. - Obviously.
00:02:53,00:02:54,- Yeah. - Flute makers.
00:02:54,00:02:56,- And they didn't put all the holes in.
00:02:56,00:02:58,"- They didn't, okay. - Oh, good call."
00:02:58,00:02:59,It's all those flutes.
00:02:59,00:03:01,"It's just a stick, really, that they say now."
00:03:01,00:03:02,- I was thinking too many holes.
00:03:02,00:03:04,"- Oh, okay. - Can you have too many holes"
00:03:04,00:03:06,"in a flute, definitely."
00:03:06,00:03:07,- Yeah. - Can you?
00:03:07,00:03:08,- Absolutely. - I think so.
00:03:08,00:03:10,I think it becomes a different instrument.
00:03:10,00:03:12,- It's only a better flute up to a point.
00:03:12,00:03:14,"- Yeah, yeah. - I think so."
00:03:14,00:03:16,"- I mean, you need your hands over the holes, don't you?"
00:03:16,00:03:18,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - So you'd run out of fingers."
00:03:18,00:03:20,"- Oh, but if you had a spare set of hands,"
00:03:20,00:03:21,"like a pantomine flute, you know,"
00:03:21,00:03:24,there's someone running the lower bit of the flute.
00:03:24,00:03:25,- A double flute.
00:03:25,00:03:28,Is that not a flute that go in both directions?
00:03:28,00:03:30,- Like Darth Maul's lightsaber.
00:03:30,00:03:32,- Yeah. (laughing)
00:03:32,00:03:34,- I feel we've stepped away for another question.
00:03:34,00:03:35,"- To help you out, these flutes"
00:03:35,00:03:38,were actually branded cool flutes.
00:03:38,00:03:40,So I don't know if that has anything to do with helmets.
00:03:40,00:03:43,"For kids, yeah, yeah, well for younger people."
00:03:43,00:03:46,"And actually, it wasn't just flutes that were recalled,"
00:03:46,00:03:48,but also binoculars that were a little cardboard boxes
00:03:48,00:03:49,with plastic lenses.
00:03:49,00:03:51,They were recalled at the same time.
00:03:51,00:03:52,"- Okay, McDonald's."
00:03:52,00:03:53,"- Yeah, I think you're on the mat track."
00:03:53,00:03:55,"- Okay, Burger King."
00:03:55,00:03:57,(laughing)
00:03:57,00:03:58,"- So I could take, I'll go on out."
00:03:58,00:04:00,- Used to get toys in cereal.
00:04:00,00:04:02,"- Absolutely, so there you go, bingo."
00:04:02,00:04:04,"So these cool flutes, they were actually found"
00:04:04,00:04:06,in boxes of corn pops.
00:04:06,00:04:10,"And they were recalled by Kellogg's, Kellogg cereal."
00:04:10,00:04:12,"So it turns out these cool flutes,"
00:04:12,00:04:14,they were made up of two little tubes
00:04:14,00:04:16,that sort of went into a mouthpiece.
00:04:16,00:04:18,"And these tubes, they could fall out"
00:04:18,00:04:20,and they were a choking hazard.
00:04:20,00:04:21,So they had to recall 30--
00:04:21,00:04:23,"- You know what, they could have done with those flutes."
00:04:23,00:04:24,Mar holes.
00:04:24,00:04:25,(laughing)
00:04:25,00:04:27,- So the reason I was looking at this in the first place
00:04:27,00:04:30,"is because I've been, I guess, fairly interested"
00:04:30,00:04:32,in just this whole world of collectible toys recently
00:04:32,00:04:34,"because it feels like we're getting a bit of a resurgence,"
00:04:34,00:04:38,"the idea of blind boxes, toy collectibles is coming back."
00:04:38,00:04:39,"- Oh, yeah."
00:04:39,00:04:40,"- I was thinking, it was so, you know,"
00:04:40,00:04:42,what was my equivalent when I was younger
00:04:42,00:04:44,in that for me was cereal box toys.
00:04:44,00:04:46,But then I sort of just started looking
00:04:46,00:04:48,at the history of cereal box toys
00:04:48,00:04:50,and the toys were kind of fascinating.
00:04:50,00:04:54,"Like, do you remember any particular toys?"
00:04:54,00:04:56,- I think maybe my earliest ever memory
00:04:56,00:04:59,is getting some Ghostbusters stickers
00:04:59,00:05:02,from out of the cereal when the film came out.
00:05:02,00:05:04,"- Wow. - So that was like early 80s, right?"
00:05:04,00:05:05,- Yeah.
00:05:05,00:05:08,I don't think I was allowed to get the kind of cereals
00:05:08,00:05:09,which came with toys in them.
00:05:09,00:05:12,"- Oh, no, they didn't have them in all branded day."
00:05:12,00:05:14,(laughing)
00:05:14,00:05:16,- They just give you a little leaflet about your mortgage.
00:05:16,00:05:18,And that's the fun for you to read and find out.
00:05:18,00:05:20,- It's time for that me to fix this.
00:05:20,00:05:21,"- What about you, Daniel?"
00:05:21,00:05:22,Did you ever get any?
00:05:22,00:05:25,- I remember the whole enjoyment and excitement
00:05:25,00:05:26,of getting them.
00:05:26,00:05:28,Right now I'm drawing a blank on the exact toys.
00:05:28,00:05:30,"But I do remember, like, quite often"
00:05:30,00:05:32,they were within the pack itself.
00:05:32,00:05:33,You had to open up the plastic
00:05:33,00:05:35,and you had to go through the fruit loops
00:05:35,00:05:37,and a lot of families had a policy
00:05:37,00:05:40,that you had to wait till it fell out during a war.
00:05:40,00:05:42,As opposed to just getting right in and grabbing it.
00:05:42,00:05:44,"- Totally, it was whoever poured it into their bowl."
00:05:44,00:05:47,So that was the unwritten rule in our society.
00:05:47,00:05:48,"- And you're an only child, aren't you?"
00:05:48,00:05:50,So you wouldn't have had this issue.
00:05:50,00:05:52,"But obviously, if you've got three or four kids"
00:05:52,00:05:54,and you've only got one tie in a pack.
00:05:54,00:05:55,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:05:55,00:05:56,"- Yeah, that's a big deal."
00:05:56,00:05:57,"- Yeah, but I think that's fair enough"
00:05:57,00:05:58,the pouring out thing.
00:05:58,00:05:59,"Like, you don't allow to plunge your hand"
00:05:59,00:06:00,into the Christmas pudding
00:06:00,00:06:01,to allow the sick to sleep in.
00:06:01,00:06:02,That's not allowed.
00:06:02,00:06:04,(laughing)
00:06:04,00:06:06,- I think I'd more incited to add these childhood.
00:06:06,00:06:08,(laughing)
00:06:08,00:06:09,"Like, one really interesting thing is"
00:06:09,00:06:13,the people who made them had to make them a certain weight.
00:06:13,00:06:14,And that is because of something
00:06:14,00:06:17,called the Brazil Nut Effect.
00:06:17,00:06:18,That if you get lots of things
00:06:18,00:06:19,that are different sizes and different weights
00:06:19,00:06:21,"and you jiggle them around,"
00:06:21,00:06:24,eventually the bigger things will end up at the top
00:06:24,00:06:26,and the smaller things will end up at the bottom.
00:06:26,00:06:28,"And this is something that's,"
00:06:28,00:06:29,"you see this in all sorts of places,"
00:06:29,00:06:31,"even like in avalanches,"
00:06:31,00:06:32,like the big bits of snow
00:06:32,00:06:34,will be at the top and the small bits of the bottom.
00:06:34,00:06:37,But they had this specific size and weight of these toys
00:06:37,00:06:39,so that they knew that if they were jiggled around
00:06:39,00:06:42,"in transport, the toy would always be kind of in the middle."
00:06:42,00:06:43,"- Ah, that was nice."
00:06:43,00:06:45,"- Ah, I didn't know that."
00:06:45,00:06:46,"- Yes, what was yours?"
00:06:46,00:06:47,You haven't given us your idea.
00:06:47,00:06:50,"- Well, so I remember the color changing spoon"
00:06:50,00:06:51,that I got in cocoa pops.
00:06:51,00:06:52,- It's you. - Thank you.
00:06:52,00:06:54,"- Yeah, so when it would go into the cold milk,"
00:06:54,00:06:55,it would change color.
00:06:55,00:06:56,- Oh my god.
00:06:56,00:06:57,"- But actually, one of those looking"
00:06:57,00:07:00,"at the various toys they have been over the years,"
00:07:00,00:07:03,it very much started out as China cereal bowls
00:07:03,00:07:05,that you would have to send off by collecting tokens
00:07:05,00:07:06,on the back of boxes.
00:07:06,00:07:10,Then Kellogg sort of saw that they were doing
00:07:10,00:07:12,"this with quaker oats and Kellogg's were like,"
00:07:12,00:07:13,we can get on the back of this.
00:07:13,00:07:15,So they started making these farm yard story books
00:07:15,00:07:17,with various flaps that you could make
00:07:17,00:07:19,funny animals out of.
00:07:19,00:07:21,"And then that sort of like started the spiral of,"
00:07:21,00:07:22,"okay, well, what else,"
00:07:22,00:07:25,what toys can we put inside the packets?
00:07:25,00:07:27,"And actually, this was sort of,"
00:07:27,00:07:29,I guess it became extremely popular
00:07:29,00:07:30,after the Second World War.
00:07:30,00:07:32,So it's sort of looking at the atomic age.
00:07:32,00:07:36,"So a lot of early cereal box toys are quite,"
00:07:36,00:07:37,literally yes.
00:07:37,00:07:39,"- No, no, no."
00:07:39,00:07:39,- What?
00:07:39,00:07:41,- It's genuinely.
00:07:41,00:07:42,- Oh my god.
00:07:42,00:07:43,- But genuinely radioactive toys
00:07:43,00:07:45,were placed inside cereal boxes.
00:07:45,00:07:47,"- Well, then you know where it is in the packet"
00:07:47,00:07:48,'cause you can see the glow.
00:07:48,00:07:49,- Yeah.
00:07:49,00:07:51,"- When I was a kid that was at first,"
00:07:51,00:07:52,"if you were at ReadyBrat,"
00:07:52,00:07:54,you would always have a glow around your whole body.
00:07:54,00:07:55,I didn't realize it was a ReadyBrat.
00:07:55,00:07:56,- Please.
00:07:56,00:07:57,(laughing)
00:07:57,00:07:59,"- I remember if you had too much sunny delight,"
00:07:59,00:08:01,"you sort of glowed orange,"
00:08:01,00:08:02,but I was a complete thing.
00:08:02,00:08:03,- You were all showing that right here.
00:08:03,00:08:04,"- Yeah, yeah, totally."
00:08:04,00:08:08,But this toy was called the Lone Ranger Atomic Bomb Ring.
00:08:08,00:08:09,- genuinely.
00:08:09,00:08:10,- Oh my god.
00:08:10,00:08:11,"- And you would get this inside Kix cereal,"
00:08:11,00:08:14,which you could get for 15 cents is in the US.
00:08:14,00:08:15,- Wow.
00:08:15,00:08:16,- It was a gold adjustable ring.
00:08:16,00:08:18,There was a little removable cap
00:08:18,00:08:20,"at the back, a little red cap that you could take off,"
00:08:20,00:08:23,and that's where you could hide secret messages.
00:08:23,00:08:26,"But then it contained something called,"
00:08:26,00:08:27,"now I think I'm saying this right,"
00:08:27,00:08:28,but a spin tharoscope.
00:08:28,00:08:30,I don't know if anyone's heard of that before.
00:08:30,00:08:32,It's basically a little device
00:08:32,00:08:35,that would contain a small amount of radioactive material.
00:08:35,00:08:37,"So in this case, it's something called Pallonium 210."
00:08:37,00:08:38,- I've heard of Pallonium.
00:08:38,00:08:39,"- There we go, Pallonium."
00:08:39,00:08:40,(laughing)
00:08:40,00:08:42,"- Yeah, normally like Pallonium has been deployed"
00:08:42,00:08:43,"on the streets of London,"
00:08:43,00:08:45,"not free Pallonium, and you'll say, what?"
00:08:45,00:08:47,"- So this was, you know, radioactive material"
00:08:47,00:08:48,discovered by Marikiri.
00:08:48,00:08:51,"Tiny small amounts of it were placed inside this ring,"
00:08:51,00:08:54,and then you would look into the atomic bomb
00:08:54,00:08:57,through a little sort of lens that contains ink sulfide.
00:08:57,00:08:58,- Right.
00:08:58,00:09:00,"- And as the Pallonium was decaying,"
00:09:00,00:09:03,"obviously you've got alpha particles that are shedding,"
00:09:03,00:09:05,"they're hitting the zinc sulfide screen,"
00:09:05,00:09:06,creating little flashes.
00:09:06,00:09:08,So the idea is your child could look inside the ring
00:09:08,00:09:11,and actually see the simulations
00:09:11,00:09:12,of this radioactive material.
00:09:12,00:09:13,"- Yeah, it's the flute we recall."
00:09:13,00:09:15,(laughing)
00:09:15,00:09:16,"- And because it had choking pieces,"
00:09:16,00:09:18,yet this ring could be sort of taken apart
00:09:18,00:09:19,"with small caps and things,"
00:09:19,00:09:21,and apparently that's fine.
00:09:21,00:09:23,- That's extraordinary.
00:09:23,00:09:25,"- I read this about this on Snopes, the website,"
00:09:25,00:09:28,and they said that there wasn't enough in it
00:09:28,00:09:29,to do you any harm?
00:09:29,00:09:29,- Right.
00:09:29,00:09:33,- Can I tell you guys my favorite serial promotion ever?
00:09:33,00:09:33,- Please do.
00:09:33,00:09:34,"- Yeah, we all have one."
00:09:34,00:09:37,- It's done by Quaker Oats.
00:09:37,00:09:38,- Okay.
00:09:38,00:09:39,- It's 1954.
00:09:39,00:09:45,"They bought 19 acres of land in Yukon,"
00:09:45,00:09:49,"in the Yukon territory, gold rush country in Canada,"
00:09:49,00:09:52,and they divided up these 19 acres into
00:09:52,00:09:55,21 million square inches.
00:09:55,00:09:55,- Right.
00:09:55,00:10:00,"- 21 million property deeds, each one for one square inch,"
00:10:00,00:10:02,"and if you sent in a box top,"
00:10:02,00:10:04,you would be sent a square inch of the Yukon.
00:10:04,00:10:05,- Wow.
00:10:05,00:10:06,- Wow.
00:10:06,00:10:07,- How interesting.
00:10:07,00:10:08,"- When was this, Sandy?"
00:10:08,00:10:09,- 1954.
00:10:09,00:10:10,- Okay. - It was not legally binding.
00:10:10,00:10:11,- I'll come.
00:10:11,00:10:12,- Oh really?
00:10:12,00:10:13,- What does that mean?
00:10:13,00:10:15,Could you go along and dig in that tiny little hatch?
00:10:15,00:10:16,"- Yeah, let's go."
00:10:16,00:10:19,"- We're like a team of your teaspoon,"
00:10:19,00:10:21,"but you got in a serial box, man."
00:10:21,00:10:23,- One boy who got one sent in four toothpicks
00:10:23,00:10:24,"on some string and he said,"
00:10:24,00:10:26,"""Can you fence my end drop please?"""
00:10:26,00:10:28,(all laughing)
00:10:28,00:10:30,- That's amazing. - So sweet.
00:10:30,00:10:31,- People do collect these ties.
00:10:31,00:10:32,Still don't they?
00:10:32,00:10:36,I went on to eBay to see what kind of things I could buy
00:10:36,00:10:38,"from some little package. - Yeah, I did too."
00:10:38,00:10:39,(all laughing)
00:10:39,00:10:40,"- Okay, what have we found?"
00:10:40,00:10:41,"Maddie, what have you found?"
00:10:41,00:10:44,"- Well, actually, it was the ring, the atomic bomb ring."
00:10:44,00:10:48,I found with the box was going for $645.
00:10:48,00:10:49,"- The box makes a difference, doesn't it?"
00:10:49,00:10:51,"- Yeah, it's huge difference."
00:10:51,00:10:54,"- And it's not like, you know, if you buy like a Marvel"
00:10:54,00:10:55,"superhero figurine or something,"
00:10:55,00:10:57,it has to be inside the box.
00:10:57,00:11:01,You just have the box next to it flattened with the tie next.
00:11:01,00:11:04,"- Oh, is that so that's the inside, the box or anything?"
00:11:04,00:11:08,I found one which was some cause monsters
00:11:08,00:11:11,"from Frank and Barry serial in America,"
00:11:11,00:11:14,"and there were 1,700 pounds."
00:11:14,00:11:15,- Wow. - Wow.
00:11:15,00:11:17,- I don't see anything happening.
00:11:17,00:11:18,- It feels like a lot.
00:11:18,00:11:18,- Frank and Barry.
00:11:18,00:11:21,"- You know, Frank and Barry, if you come across them,"
00:11:21,00:11:23,was it the 90s I think in America they had them?
00:11:23,00:11:25,"And they were a bit like, what are those serials"
00:11:25,00:11:27,"that have little marshmallows in that have like,"
00:11:27,00:11:28,got leprechauns on?
00:11:28,00:11:29,"- Lucky charms. - Lucky charms, yeah, yeah."
00:11:29,00:11:31,So it was like that when it was monsters.
00:11:31,00:11:36,And the marshmallows were like pink and purple and stuff.
00:11:36,00:11:38,"And the kids reat in it, and this die would go straight"
00:11:38,00:11:40,through them and come out of the toilet.
00:11:40,00:11:42,"And it looked like, you know, I've had this"
00:11:42,00:11:44,when my daughter eats beetroot.
00:11:44,00:11:46,"And I'm like, to my wife, believe it,"
00:11:46,00:11:48,"believe it, we need to go to any of these."
00:11:48,00:11:50,"No, she had beetroot yesterday."
00:11:50,00:11:52,But like it would come out and they had a thing called
00:11:52,00:11:55,Frank and Barry stool that was in like medical papers
00:11:55,00:11:57,"saying, this is right."
00:11:57,00:11:59,- It looks like people had blood in the paper.
00:11:59,00:12:00,- Was this one of the serials
00:12:00,00:12:04,that was basically 95% of sugar?
00:12:04,00:12:04,- Yes.
00:12:04,00:12:06,"- With some, like, I don't want to say,"
00:12:06,00:12:08,'cause I think they might still be extant.
00:12:08,00:12:10,"But yeah, I think there was a lot of sugar in them."
00:12:10,00:12:12,"But the interesting thing about that is,"
00:12:12,00:12:15,"so serials, Kellogg's, like the Kellogg's brothers,"
00:12:15,00:12:19,they had a sanatorium in North of America somewhere.
00:12:19,00:12:20,- That's crazy.
00:12:20,00:12:21,"- But like, Battle Creek, that's it."
00:12:21,00:12:22,"And there were two brothers,"
00:12:22,00:12:24,and one of the brothers decided
00:12:24,00:12:26,we're gonna start putting sugar in it
00:12:26,00:12:29,in order to attract younger people to eat it
00:12:29,00:12:30,"and not just be a health food,"
00:12:30,00:12:32,and they really fell out over that.
00:12:32,00:12:33,And they properly fell out.
00:12:33,00:12:35,"- But ultimately, it was the fact"
00:12:35,00:12:36,"that these were sugary serials,"
00:12:36,00:12:40,which is why we stopped getting serial box toys.
00:12:40,00:12:41,"It was meant there were many factors,"
00:12:41,00:12:44,but one of them was the fact that these were
00:12:44,00:12:47,slightly less nutritious foods.
00:12:47,00:12:48,"I think there was, there was a pledge,"
00:12:48,00:12:50,"it was a voluntary pledge,"
00:12:50,00:12:52,"which included the likes of General Mills and Kellogg's,"
00:12:52,00:12:53,"they got together and they said,"
00:12:53,00:12:55,"""Hey, you know what, it's not right for us"
00:12:55,00:12:57,"""to push less nutritious foods at children,"
00:12:57,00:13:00,"""which is why they started taking toys away."""
00:13:00,00:13:03,"Although, first, they removed toys for children,"
00:13:03,00:13:05,but that's when they started putting in things
00:13:05,00:13:09,like pedometers and reflective bike stickers.
00:13:09,00:13:12,So they didn't sort of remove things on it.
00:13:12,00:13:13,- Tell me more.
00:13:13,00:13:16,(laughing)
00:13:16,00:13:18,"- But yeah, so that was kind of their attempt to be like,"
00:13:18,00:13:19,"""Okay, we're not putting toys in them,"
00:13:19,00:13:23,"""but we've had sports-related gifts in."""
00:13:23,00:13:26,- Can I tell you guys something about a friend of the podcast?
00:13:26,00:13:28,"- Yes. - So, Henry Perky,"
00:13:28,00:13:29,you guys might remember?
00:13:29,00:13:30,- Yeah.
00:13:30,00:13:31,"- ""Eventer of Shredded Wheat."""
00:13:31,00:13:33,- Yeah. - And father of the man
00:13:33,00:13:35,who then invented round shredded wheat.
00:13:35,00:13:36,"- Okay. - Yeah, yeah."
00:13:36,00:13:38,- Very much at Nipo-Serie last minute.
00:13:38,00:13:38,- Absolutely.
00:13:38,00:13:40,(laughing)
00:13:40,00:13:41,- I thought it was knitted by Granny's.
00:13:41,00:13:43,Can't believe it. (laughing)
00:13:43,00:13:44,- A myth busted.
00:13:44,00:13:45,(laughing)
00:13:45,00:13:48,- But his initial intention was not
00:13:48,00:13:50,making shredded wheat to sell them to people.
00:13:50,00:13:53,He wanted everyone to buy shredded wheat making machines.
00:13:53,00:13:54,This was his big thing.
00:13:54,00:13:55,- Okay.
00:13:55,00:13:57,- He created a machine which shredded wheat.
00:13:57,00:13:58,"And then people just said,"
00:13:58,00:14:00,"""Can we have some more of the shredded wheat, please?"""
00:14:00,00:14:02,"And he said, ""Anyone of the machine that makes it?"""
00:14:02,00:14:05,"So they could've been, well, we'll be all hedge on our counter."
00:14:05,00:14:06,- Like a soda stream.
00:14:06,00:14:07,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:14:07,00:14:08,- Or an average.
00:14:08,00:14:10,"- I just slightly ran him a question for you, Maddie."
00:14:10,00:14:13,"So when I first moved to Australia when I was 12,"
00:14:13,00:14:16,I became star-struck when I met the voice
00:14:16,00:14:19,of the Australian cocoa pop monkey.
00:14:19,00:14:20,- I know the British one.
00:14:20,00:14:22,"- Well, this is what I was gonna ask."
00:14:22,00:14:23,You must know all of these people
00:14:23,00:14:25,because of what you do.
00:14:25,00:14:25,- Yeah.
00:14:25,00:14:28,- The world of voices for these iconic characters.
00:14:28,00:14:30,- This is so bizarre that you've asked me this
00:14:30,00:14:32,because genuinely one of my best friends
00:14:32,00:14:34,is the voice of the cocoa pop monkey.
00:14:34,00:14:35,- Oh my God.
00:14:35,00:14:36,"- No, I'm not even kidding."
00:14:36,00:14:36,- Oh my gosh.
00:14:36,00:14:37,"- I'm genuinely, yeah."
00:14:37,00:14:38,- Why?
00:14:38,00:14:40,"- Yeah, he does really well from it."
00:14:40,00:14:43,But the cocoa pop monkey doesn't talk so much anymore.
00:14:43,00:14:46,"So as far as I'm aware, every couple of years,"
00:14:46,00:14:48,"they'll say, ""Hey, can you come to the recording booth"
00:14:48,00:14:51,"""and he'll just have to record a giggle?"""
00:14:51,00:14:51,(laughing)
00:14:51,00:14:52,"- Yeah, I was gonna say,"
00:14:52,00:14:54,I know that cocoa would recognize his voice.
00:14:54,00:14:56,"- No, Tony the Tiger is the one that I'm gonna say."
00:14:56,00:14:56,- I would recognize it.
00:14:56,00:14:58,"If he was in the room next door,"
00:14:58,00:14:59,"if I was in a restaurant,"
00:14:59,00:15:01,Tony the Tiger was at the next table.
00:15:01,00:15:02,- You'd ask to be moved.
00:15:02,00:15:03,"- No, I would recognize it."
00:15:03,00:15:05,"- Oh, I think so, you know what I mean?"
00:15:05,00:15:06,(laughing)
00:15:06,00:15:07,"- Guy, he thinks everything's great."
00:15:07,00:15:08,- Yeah.
00:15:08,00:15:09,- The guy's soup is not great.
00:15:09,00:15:12,(laughing)
00:15:12,00:15:14,- Yeah.
00:15:14,00:15:17,- As far as I know that in his many years
00:15:17,00:15:19,"of being the voice of the cocoa pop monkey, cocoa,"
00:15:19,00:15:21,I don't think the monkey talks much.
00:15:21,00:15:24,"Chocolatey goodness, something about 10 to the milk chocolatey."
00:15:24,00:15:26,"- Oh, you said that, yeah."
00:15:26,00:15:28,- I think that was kind of the catchphrase.
00:15:28,00:15:30,- That was a song when they briefly
00:15:30,00:15:32,and ill-fatedly changed their name to chocolate crispies
00:15:32,00:15:34,and then realized too late it didn't scan
00:15:34,00:15:37,when I'd rather have a bowl of chocolate crispies.
00:15:37,00:15:39,(laughing)
00:15:39,00:15:40,"- Thank you, back."
00:15:40,00:15:42,(upbeat music)
00:15:42,00:15:46,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two"
00:15:46,00:15:47,and that is my fact.
00:15:47,00:15:51,My fact this week is that after years of publicly arguing
00:15:51,00:15:53,"that the Milky Way is the only galaxy in the universe,"
00:15:53,00:15:56,one of Harvard University's head astronomers
00:15:56,00:15:58,realized that actually he was wrong
00:15:58,00:16:02,"and then went on to map 76,000 galaxies."
00:16:02,00:16:03,- So awkward.
00:16:03,00:16:05,(laughing)
00:16:05,00:16:06,- Who was he?
00:16:06,00:16:08,- His name was Harlow Shapley.
00:16:08,00:16:11,"He lived 1885 to 1972, American astronomer,"
00:16:11,00:16:15,and he served as the head of the Harvard College Observatory.
00:16:15,00:16:18,"Now, what's amazing is up until the 1920s,"
00:16:18,00:16:21,most astronomers believe that our galaxy
00:16:21,00:16:23,was the single galaxy in the universe.
00:16:23,00:16:24,That was it.
00:16:24,00:16:25,"If we were expanding, it would have been into that."
00:16:25,00:16:27,That was the idea of the time.
00:16:27,00:16:30,"So, suddenly a few scientists started coming up"
00:16:30,00:16:33,saying actually I think it might be a bit bigger.
00:16:33,00:16:35,One of whom was Edwin Hubble.
00:16:35,00:16:39,And Shapley really thought that this was junk science.
00:16:39,00:16:41,He took part in a debate with a man called Curtis
00:16:41,00:16:43,where they both presented their findings
00:16:43,00:16:45,to say whether or not it was the case
00:16:45,00:16:46,and he stuck with it.
00:16:46,00:16:50,And so it wasn't until Hubble eventually showed him proof
00:16:50,00:16:54,by sending him a letter of something that he discovered
00:16:54,00:16:57,that he then said this is completely destroyed my universe
00:16:57,00:16:59,"and accepted it, which is the wonderful thing about science."
00:16:59,00:17:00,It's not opinion.
00:17:00,00:17:04,"If the facts are in front of you, you can go onto map 76,000 galaxies."
00:17:04,00:17:05,"So, it's quite nice."
00:17:05,00:17:07,That is such a good quote as well.
00:17:07,00:17:11,This is the letter that destroyed my universe quite literally
00:17:11,00:17:12,"and in many, many ways."
00:17:12,00:17:13,I love that.
00:17:13,00:17:14,It's really cool.
00:17:14,00:17:17,This debate they had is known as the Great Debate
00:17:17,00:17:19,between Shapley and Curtis.
00:17:19,00:17:23,"And basically, Curtis thought that there was extra galaxies."
00:17:23,00:17:25,And Shapley thought that there was only one galaxy
00:17:25,00:17:27,but that we weren't in the middle of it.
00:17:27,00:17:29,We were kind of on the side of it.
00:17:29,00:17:31,And Curtis thought that we were in the middle of our galaxy
00:17:31,00:17:33,and it turned out they were both wrong
00:17:33,00:17:37,"or both right at the same time, which again is quite good about science."
00:17:37,00:17:40,"It's like you might be right, you might be wrong or more likely."
00:17:40,00:17:43,You might be kind of right in some ways and wrong in some ways.
00:17:43,00:17:45,"Yeah, because we're not in the middle of our galaxy."
00:17:45,00:17:46,"We're on an arm, right?"
00:17:46,00:17:49,We're on an outer tentacle.
00:17:49,00:17:50,Exactly.
00:17:50,00:17:51,The giant great octopus.
00:17:51,00:17:52,Thank you.
00:17:52,00:17:58,The center of our galaxy is within the Sagittarius constellation
00:17:58,00:18:01,and actually it's the part of the Sagittarius constellation.
00:18:01,00:18:02,I think it's the five brightest stars
00:18:02,00:18:04,that make up the shape of a teapot.
00:18:04,00:18:07,"So actually, the center of our galaxy, the Milky Way,"
00:18:07,00:18:10,is sort of just above the spout of a teapot.
00:18:10,00:18:11,"I know, it looks like a teapot."
00:18:11,00:18:13,Shine British flag at the same time.
00:18:13,00:18:15,"Yeah, it's a very British flag."
00:18:15,00:18:16,Yeah.
00:18:16,00:18:20,So it was Edwin Hubble that basically proved Shapley that he was wrong.
00:18:20,00:18:23,But this isn't the first time that Edwin Hubble has proved somebody wrong.
00:18:23,00:18:24,"Oh, really?"
00:18:24,00:18:27,"In fact, he also proved Einstein wrong."
00:18:27,00:18:28,At one point as well.
00:18:28,00:18:32,"Back then, Albert Einstein was looking at his calculations of space"
00:18:32,00:18:34,"and going, this doesn't really quite make sense"
00:18:34,00:18:37,"because if gravity is such a big, important thing,"
00:18:37,00:18:40,then surely everything should be coming towards each other.
00:18:40,00:18:42,Surely the galaxy should be shrinking.
00:18:42,00:18:43,"So to make sense of the math,"
00:18:43,00:18:46,"he introduced this thing called a constant,"
00:18:46,00:18:48,"a cosmological constant, which is just from now on."
00:18:48,00:18:50,Space is static.
00:18:50,00:18:52,I say it's still because that's what makes sense.
00:18:52,00:18:53,Wow.
00:18:53,00:18:55,"And then Hubble came along and was like,"
00:18:55,00:18:59,"oh, really sorry, but actually look at this, here's my proof."
00:18:59,00:19:01,We now know about looking at the way light moves
00:19:01,00:19:02,and looking at redshift.
00:19:02,00:19:05,I can tell you that the universe is in fact expanding.
00:19:05,00:19:07,"So I'm sorry, you're wrong."
00:19:07,00:19:10,"And Einstein said, yeah, that was probably my greatest blunder."
00:19:10,00:19:12,"Why knock some down, doesn't he?"
00:19:12,00:19:13,Yeah.
00:19:13,00:19:15,Hubble didn't have a funeral.
00:19:15,00:19:19,His wife wouldn't tell anyone what had happened to him.
00:19:19,00:19:20,I just find this mysterious.
00:19:20,00:19:22,"Oh, we know how he died, right?"
00:19:22,00:19:24,Like it was in a mysterious death.
00:19:24,00:19:25,I don't know. But I know that he died.
00:19:25,00:19:28,"I think, yeah, I think probably he died normally."
00:19:28,00:19:31,And then she just didn't tell us the location.
00:19:31,00:19:32,"What Einstein is, we're not saying"
00:19:32,00:19:35,there's anything nefarious going on with his wife.
00:19:35,00:19:36,"Yeah, I'm not saying there isn't, though."
00:19:36,00:19:37,Are you?
00:19:37,00:19:38,"Well, I'm just not saying, I mean, it's a cold case."
00:19:38,00:19:40,"I'm saying, we don't know."
00:19:40,00:19:41,And that's actually the scientific method
00:19:41,00:19:45,"to just saying, don't know, and then hope someone else does the work."
00:19:45,00:19:47,"No, he didn't have a funeral."
00:19:47,00:19:49,And his wife refused to say either where he was buried
00:19:49,00:19:51,or whether his ashes had been scattered or where
00:19:51,00:19:52,or anything like that.
00:19:52,00:19:56,And he was making lots of enemies of scientists
00:19:56,00:19:57,by proving them wrong every day.
00:19:57,00:19:58,Exactly.
00:19:58,00:19:59,Exactly.
00:19:59,00:20:01,"There's no way to visit, but I guess he does have a fairly big telescope."
00:20:01,00:20:04,"Well, you know, it's just like the observatory up there now"
00:20:04,00:20:06,that we can all remember him by his face.
00:20:06,00:20:07,"Yes, you're right."
00:20:07,00:20:09,He didn't start out as a scientist.
00:20:09,00:20:11,He started out thanks to family pressure studying law.
00:20:11,00:20:12,"Oh, yeah."
00:20:12,00:20:16,Because his family taught him like there's no future in this science thing.
00:20:16,00:20:20,"And then he spent a year teaching high school physics, which I love."
00:20:20,00:20:22,Imagine if Mr. Hubble was your...
00:20:22,00:20:23,"Yes, he did."
00:20:23,00:20:24,Just pretty cool.
00:20:24,00:20:25,And basketball as well.
00:20:25,00:20:26,And he was very nifty on the basketball court.
00:20:26,00:20:27,And not just Nifty.
00:20:27,00:20:30,He was a major basketball player for his college.
00:20:30,00:20:33,And a lot of people said he could have become a professional
00:20:33,00:20:34,in a couple of different sports.
00:20:34,00:20:36,So he had that little decision to make.
00:20:36,00:20:37,"Well, those guys."
00:20:37,00:20:38,Good evening.
00:20:38,00:20:39,Good evening.
00:20:39,00:20:40,Yeah.
00:20:40,00:20:42,Shapley also had an interesting beginning
00:20:42,00:20:45,because he was an incredibly clever kid.
00:20:45,00:20:47,"He advanced in his school years, you know, those kids"
00:20:47,00:20:50,"that you hear that graduate, you know, their high school"
00:20:50,00:20:51,when they're like nine.
00:20:51,00:20:54,He was that kind of kid.
00:20:54,00:20:56,And he didn't know what he wanted to study.
00:20:56,00:21:00,And he decided I'm going to just study and do in life what I see first
00:21:00,00:21:03,"on the list, the alphabetical list of subjects for college."
00:21:03,00:21:05,He said he kept an acrobat.
00:21:05,00:21:09,"Yeah, but only because advox studies were full."
00:21:09,00:21:10,Yeah.
00:21:10,00:21:14,"Yeah, he said he rejected archaeology because he couldn't pronounce it properly."
00:21:14,00:21:16,So he picked astronomy.
00:21:16,00:21:21,"It's probably a nice mythology he's created for himself, but that's his claim."
00:21:21,00:21:26,"In the 40s, he rescued lots of his colleagues from the Nazis."
00:21:26,00:21:31,"So lots of scientists in Germany, especially Jewish ones, were being victimized."
00:21:31,00:21:36,"And he got them out of there and brought them over to America and sort of signed, said,"
00:21:36,00:21:39,"oh, they're going to be really important for our university."
00:21:39,00:21:41,So I'm going to get them out here.
00:21:41,00:21:44,And they reckon he saved up at least a thousand families from the Nazis.
00:21:44,00:21:45,Wow.
00:21:45,00:21:46,That was Shapley.
00:21:46,00:21:47,That was Shapley.
00:21:47,00:21:52,So the stars will not be of much good to us if we do not preserve the minds with which to
00:21:52,00:21:54,comprehend them.
00:21:54,00:21:58,"And then after that, he was accused of being a communist."
00:21:58,00:22:04,"And that's because in those days, you could be accused of being a premature anti-fascist."
00:22:04,00:22:10,"If you, if you, like, you were lads and not like you, this never happens."
00:22:10,00:22:17,"So, like, the idea is like you, if you didn't like the fascists in 1945, that was fine."
00:22:17,00:22:21,"But if you didn't like them in the 30s, that was dodgy in America."
00:22:21,00:22:25,"Because they were still, the idea was that Hitler was the one who saved Germany from communism."
00:22:25,00:22:29,"Generally speaking, in America, people were not massively anti the Nazis until the war."
00:22:29,00:22:30,Yeah.
00:22:30,00:22:34,"And so if you could be seen to be anti them before the war, people thought you were a communist."
00:22:34,00:22:35,"Oh, gosh."
00:22:35,00:22:36,Isn't that amazing?
00:22:36,00:22:40,"So you had a narrow window to say, you know what?"
00:22:40,00:22:41,I'm not sure about these guys.
00:22:41,00:22:43,I hear about these.
00:22:43,00:22:49,"Well, yeah, he appeared before the Un-American Activities Committee, the McCarthy Committee."
00:22:49,00:22:50,"Oh, sure."
00:22:50,00:22:51,But yeah.
00:22:51,00:22:53,"Yeah, really interesting guy."
00:22:53,00:22:54,Yeah.
00:22:54,00:22:55,That's fascinating.
00:22:55,00:23:02,"So the, the star that was spotted by Hubble is arguably the second most important star"
00:23:02,00:23:03,in the universe.
00:23:03,00:23:05,So is this the one that proved that we are?
00:23:05,00:23:06,"Yeah, right."
00:23:06,00:23:08,"Yeah, it's called V1."
00:23:08,00:23:10,And it's located in the Andromeda Nebula.
00:23:10,00:23:13,It's 2.2 million light years away.
00:23:13,00:23:18,And it has 1/100th of the brightness of the faintest star that is visible to our naked eye.
00:23:18,00:23:19,Right.
00:23:19,00:23:24,And I've read that it's often used as a marker for when you're judging other galaxies now.
00:23:24,00:23:27,Because you need a marker point to go where it's further and where it's not.
00:23:27,00:23:28,Yeah.
00:23:28,00:23:32,"So because it's a little bit dimmer, they can go that is definitely really far away."
00:23:32,00:23:33,Yeah.
00:23:33,00:23:35,"Way, way further away than anything that could be within our galaxy."
00:23:35,00:23:36,Exactly.
00:23:36,00:23:37,Yeah.
00:23:37,00:23:38,Yeah.
00:23:38,00:23:39,Yeah.
00:23:39,00:23:40,It's pretty amazing.
00:23:40,00:23:44,"The naked eye, if you really, really, really look, it just looks like a smudge if it's really"
00:23:44,00:23:45,dark.
00:23:45,00:23:46,Right.
00:23:46,00:23:48,"They thought it was a star for a long time, and then it was only of course when they got these"
00:23:48,00:23:51,"really good telescopes, you could tell that it was a group of stars."
00:23:51,00:23:53,"That's quite a close galaxy, I presume."
00:23:53,00:23:54,"Closest, I think."
00:23:54,00:23:55,Is it?
00:23:55,00:23:56,Maybe.
00:23:56,00:23:57,It's one of our closest.
00:23:57,00:23:59,I think one day the Andromeda is going to crash into ours.
00:23:59,00:24:00,All right.
00:24:00,00:24:03,You don't need to worry about it because it'll be like in millions and millions and millions
00:24:03,00:24:04,of years.
00:24:04,00:24:05,Yeah.
00:24:05,00:24:07,"But I've also read that if two galaxies are going to crash into each other, the size of"
00:24:07,00:24:10,galaxies would mean that you would just pass through each other and not notice.
00:24:10,00:24:11,What?
00:24:11,00:24:12,"Oh, that's cool."
00:24:12,00:24:13,Yeah.
00:24:13,00:24:16,The space in between each place in a galaxy is so great.
00:24:16,00:24:17,Yeah.
00:24:17,00:24:18,It's so easy to be some collisions.
00:24:18,00:24:19,We've all just...
00:24:19,00:24:23,"What's playing in the alley, I think, is that the gravity would pull them kind of together"
00:24:23,00:24:26,and they would join the mass of the stars.
00:24:26,00:24:27,Right.
00:24:27,00:24:30,"There'll be some dents in the fender, I'm sure, at the end of the process."
00:24:30,00:24:31,Yes.
00:24:31,00:24:36,"50 billion of the stars in our galaxy now, they arrived here eight billion years ago"
00:24:36,00:24:41,when our galaxy collided with another galaxy called the sausage galaxy.
00:24:41,00:24:42,Amazing.
00:24:42,00:24:43,Amazing.
00:24:43,00:24:48,I don't even know where to believe you.
00:24:48,00:24:49,It's true.
00:24:49,00:24:50,It's true.
00:24:50,00:24:51,It's sometimes...
00:24:51,00:24:54,It's sometimes called the Gaia Enceladus Galaxy.
00:24:54,00:24:55,Definitely.
00:24:55,00:25:00,And some places called the sausage galaxy and it collided with ours and we've got a lot
00:25:00,00:25:01,of stars from around here.
00:25:01,00:25:02,The sausage and teapot.
00:25:02,00:25:03,It's basically what we're talking about.
00:25:03,00:25:04,It's an English breakfast.
00:25:04,00:25:09,It's just one giant full English that we're living in.
00:25:09,00:25:13,"But on the sausage front, I do think some astronauts have reported just generally space"
00:25:13,00:25:18,"to smell a little bit like barbeque and barbeque, yeah, because when they've come back in"
00:25:18,00:25:24,"after a spacewalk, they've noticed the scent of barbeque on their spacesuits."
00:25:24,00:25:25,Wow.
00:25:25,00:25:28,But also in terms of what does space smell like.
00:25:28,00:25:33,"If we actually look at the Milky Way, so our galaxy, there is an area within the Milky"
00:25:33,00:25:37,"Way, got this giant cloud of gas and dust, you've got this a star forming region."
00:25:37,00:25:41,"And they discover that it was packed full of this chemical known as Ethyl Formates, which"
00:25:41,00:25:45,"is responsible for giving both raspberries and rum, their flavour."
00:25:45,00:25:46,Oh.
00:25:46,00:25:51,"So not only do we have the teapot and sausages, we also have rum and raspberries as well."
00:25:51,00:25:52,"Oh, and milk."
00:25:52,00:25:53,Milk for the tea.
00:25:53,00:25:54,The Milky Way.
00:25:54,00:25:55,Of course.
00:25:55,00:25:56,Yeah.
00:25:56,00:25:57,How exciting.
00:25:57,00:26:04,"See, we should acknowledge as well a quick shout out to Henrietta Swan Levit, who was known"
00:26:04,00:26:08,"as a human computer, and at one point also worked at Harvard University's observatory many,"
00:26:08,00:26:11,many years before Shapley got there.
00:26:11,00:26:17,"She's the person who worked out a thing about the rate of pulses coming out of the star,"
00:26:17,00:26:19,which was then used by Hubble.
00:26:19,00:26:20,Now I see.
00:26:20,00:26:24,So she kind of like came up with a standard of this is how you can work out how far away
00:26:24,00:26:28,the star is by measuring the luminosity of its pulses.
00:26:28,00:26:35,"Now you measure luminosity and crabs, I think, which is the crab nebula has a certain"
00:26:35,00:26:36,luminosity.
00:26:36,00:26:38,It's a certain luminosity.
00:26:38,00:26:41,"And it's like, is it brighter or less bright than the crab nebula?"
00:26:41,00:26:45,"So something seven crabs, it's seven times brighter than the crab nebula."
00:26:45,00:26:50,"Is this just a big, like, bar and grill restaurant out of space?"
00:26:50,00:26:51,Yeah.
00:26:51,00:26:52,I don't mind it.
00:26:52,00:26:53,We should start a themed restaurant.
00:26:53,00:26:56,"The menu is looking really, really good."
00:26:56,00:27:01,"I guess, I don't know, but with these, the pulsars, with these stars and a pulsing, the"
00:27:01,00:27:04,"sephid stars that we're able to measure distance with, I'm assuming that they're very,"
00:27:04,00:27:09,"very unlikely to have life around them, because the light they're emitting is so, so unreliable."
00:27:09,00:27:13,"I've got a room at the moment with a bulb, which is dodgy, and you can't be in that room."
00:27:13,00:27:18,"It's on one of the old dimmer switches, and we put a new dimmer bulb in, and it's just"
00:27:18,00:27:19,an absolute nightmare to be in.
00:27:19,00:27:20,I hate that.
00:27:20,00:27:21,Yeah.
00:27:21,00:27:23,That makes sense to me.
00:27:23,00:27:24,That's crazy.
00:27:24,00:27:25,But it's not really hot.
00:27:25,00:27:27,"Thank you, Professor."
00:27:27,00:27:32,Why really like about this thing about chaply and Hubble is they suddenly increased the size
00:27:32,00:27:33,of the universe?
00:27:33,00:27:34,Yes.
00:27:34,00:27:35,Right?
00:27:35,00:27:41,"So we start with Tollamy all the way back in ancient times, and he thought that the entire"
00:27:41,00:27:44,"universe was 20,000 times the Earth's radius."
00:27:44,00:27:45,"20,000?"
00:27:45,00:27:46,Okay.
00:27:46,00:27:50,"And he worked out out by saying, okay, well, the Earth is here in the middle."
00:27:50,00:27:54,"Everything goes round us, and then there's Mercury and Venus and the Sun and Mars and Jupiter,"
00:27:54,00:27:58,"and then there's something else and something else, and eventually you get to the stars."
00:27:58,00:28:02,"And he had this nice little sort of nesting tables where everything goes, and he worked"
00:28:02,00:28:03,that out.
00:28:03,00:28:07,"And then Newton comes along and says, okay, well, the stars don't seem to move much according"
00:28:07,00:28:15,"to each other, so they don't have parallax, which is parallax is like if you put your thumb"
00:28:15,00:28:20,"in front of your face and then close one eye and close the other, it seems to move, but"
00:28:20,00:28:23,"if you do it with something far away, it moves much less."
00:28:23,00:28:26,"So he worked out with the stars, they're not doing that, so they must be really far away."
00:28:26,00:28:29,"So that got the universe much, much bigger."
00:28:29,00:28:34,"And then the guy called Friedrich Bessel, he managed to work out the parallax, so there"
00:28:34,00:28:40,"is slight parallax and worked out that the, now the universe is light years in size."
00:28:40,00:28:41,And then we got this great debate.
00:28:41,00:28:46,"We worked out that there's more than one galaxy, and then they found background radiation,"
00:28:46,00:28:51,"which meant that suddenly the universe is, we don't know how big it is, but the observable"
00:28:51,00:28:55,universe is as far as light could get to us from when the universe started.
00:28:55,00:28:56,Yes.
00:28:56,00:28:57,And I've heard that.
00:28:57,00:28:59,I just love how it kind of inspires.
00:28:59,00:29:00,It's really cool.
00:29:00,00:29:01,Yeah.
00:29:01,00:29:02,How much further should we go?
00:29:02,00:29:03,I'm sure it wouldn't be at some stage.
00:29:03,00:29:04,It'll get bigger still.
00:29:04,00:29:05,We just don't know how.
00:29:05,00:29:06,We don't know how.
00:29:06,00:29:07,Yeah.
00:29:07,00:29:08,So cool.
00:29:08,00:29:09,"Well, this is I think, you know, the new James Webb Space Telescope."
00:29:09,00:29:10,Yeah.
00:29:10,00:29:11,"Very, very big telescope."
00:29:11,00:29:14,"I've pushed into orbit for, for better views and things like that."
00:29:14,00:29:20,"And it has found six enormous ancient galaxies, which would be nicknamed the universe breakers."
00:29:20,00:29:21,And I love this.
00:29:21,00:29:22,"And they shouldn't exist, right?"
00:29:22,00:29:23,Wow.
00:29:23,00:29:24,Wow.
00:29:24,00:29:28,"There should only be, from the point of where they are, you know, we know how long the light"
00:29:28,00:29:29,has taken to travel to us.
00:29:29,00:29:31,We know the rough age they are.
00:29:31,00:29:35,"They should not have had time to form, because they date to 500 million years after the"
00:29:35,00:29:36,big bang.
00:29:36,00:29:39,"There should only be tiny baby galaxies there, but they're very well developed."
00:29:39,00:29:44,And please tell me they look like a Hushbrown.
00:29:44,00:29:52,We need it on the menu.
00:29:52,00:29:53,Okay.
00:29:53,00:29:55,"There's time for fact number three, and that is Andy."
00:29:55,00:30:03,"My fact is, the first ever geothermal power station powered five light bulbs or some"
00:30:03,00:30:07,"sources say full, but I prefer that I'm backing it."
00:30:07,00:30:08,I think it's the source I found.
00:30:08,00:30:09,Yeah.
00:30:09,00:30:14,"And fifth one, it was liable, but it kept going on and off, and it was really a way."
00:30:14,00:30:17,I just have to tell it off after working the dark.
00:30:17,00:30:23,"This was in 1904, and we're in Tuscany, or lovely, lovely, but with an anti-painter picture."
00:30:23,00:30:24,Absolutely.
00:30:24,00:30:29,"Well, just hear those Tuscany, local animals and flora and fauna."
00:30:29,00:30:31,Glass of Montipolciano.
00:30:31,00:30:32,Beautiful.
00:30:32,00:30:34,Overlooking the Tower of Pisa.
00:30:34,00:30:35,Probably.
00:30:35,00:30:41,The Taurus kind of pretending to hold it up.
00:30:41,00:30:44,And this is in an area called the Devil's Valley.
00:30:44,00:30:48,"Oh, it's not the Tower of Pisa."
00:30:48,00:30:52,But I suppose it's appropriate that it was the Devil's Valley because we're going underground
00:30:52,00:30:54,into the warm.
00:30:54,00:31:01,And this was where a guy called Prince Piano or Ginori Conti lit up the first ever geothermal
00:31:01,00:31:02,power station.
00:31:02,00:31:04,So that is taking.
00:31:04,00:31:07,"We need from underground, bringing it above ground."
00:31:07,00:31:10,And there are various different ways you can harness the power.
00:31:10,00:31:15,"One of them is by directly using steam from underground to turn a turbine, which then spins"
00:31:15,00:31:17,up and generates electricity.
00:31:17,00:31:20,"There are lots of different methods of doing it, which I'm sure we'll get into."
00:31:20,00:31:23,But this first little experiment did four or five light bulbs.
00:31:23,00:31:24,That's so tiny.
00:31:24,00:31:25,That's so cool.
00:31:25,00:31:29,"But it's the cradle of geothermal, which is now being talked of as a big solution to"
00:31:29,00:31:33,"lots of power shortages and a much, much cleaner way of powering the world than fossil."
00:31:33,00:31:35,So there's a lot of renewed excitement about it.
00:31:35,00:31:36,"And it's still going, isn't it?"
00:31:36,00:31:40,"Over a hundred years later, that exact spot they have a huge factory that is producing"
00:31:40,00:31:41,geothermal.
00:31:41,00:31:42,Yeah.
00:31:42,00:31:47,That Devil's Valley was the landscape that inspired Dante to make hell in divine comedy.
00:31:47,00:31:50,"So when he writes about hell, he's talking about that place."
00:31:50,00:31:51,Oh my goodness.
00:31:51,00:31:52,That's cool.
00:31:52,00:31:53,That's so cool.
00:31:53,00:31:56,So not the picture I've seen painting for his at all.
00:31:56,00:31:57,That's wrong.
00:31:57,00:31:59,It'd be opposite.
00:31:59,00:32:00,"Yeah, really amazing."
00:32:00,00:32:01,"This guy was here, Prince."
00:32:01,00:32:04,So I read he was Prince of Trevich Nano.
00:32:04,00:32:05,I think he was.
00:32:05,00:32:06,I couldn't get to the bottom of that either.
00:32:06,00:32:09,It's sort of in some places it didn't mention it and then other places suddenly Prince was attached
00:32:09,00:32:10,to his name.
00:32:10,00:32:11,I think he was.
00:32:11,00:32:13,I think he was narrows the correct.
00:32:13,00:32:14,He was.
00:32:14,00:32:15,I'm afraid.
00:32:15,00:32:20,"Second mention for the fascist in the show, he was made for the Mussolini before or after"
00:32:20,00:32:21,it all went wrong.
00:32:21,00:32:24,He was friends when it was fashionable in Italy to be friends with Mussolini.
00:32:24,00:32:26,I don't know what happened after the war.
00:32:26,00:32:27,Okay.
00:32:27,00:32:28,Yeah.
00:32:28,00:32:29,"Well, I know what happened to Mussolini."
00:32:29,00:32:30,"Oh, I know."
00:32:30,00:32:33,But he was processing Boracacid.
00:32:33,00:32:34,Yes.
00:32:34,00:32:35,Where is that?
00:32:35,00:32:36,Boracacid.
00:32:36,00:32:37,Boracacid.
00:32:37,00:32:38,From this particular area.
00:32:38,00:32:39,"Yeah, exactly."
00:32:39,00:32:45,And then he realised that he could make electricity from it and then started this geothermal
00:32:45,00:32:46,company afterwards.
00:32:46,00:32:47,Didn't he?
00:32:47,00:32:48,Right.
00:32:48,00:32:52,I'm surprised it's first happened in Tuscany actually because when I think of areas of geothermal
00:32:52,00:32:57,"activity, I immediately think of Iceland and that's kind of where I immediately go."
00:32:57,00:33:03,"I think Italy's a relatively big user of geothermal, despite it's a tiny, tiny percentage"
00:33:03,00:33:04,of its power.
00:33:04,00:33:06,"They do have a few volcanoes there, don't they?"
00:33:06,00:33:07,"Oh, yeah."
00:33:07,00:33:08,That's what I suppose.
00:33:08,00:33:09,Yeah.
00:33:09,00:33:10,"And basically, that's the thing."
00:33:10,00:33:16,"Traditional geothermal relies on very specific conditions, which is it's tectonic things, lots"
00:33:16,00:33:19,of heat close to the surface so you don't need to drill down for miles and miles.
00:33:19,00:33:22,So Iceland is brilliant because it's got exactly that.
00:33:22,00:33:24,Kenya is very good for it.
00:33:24,00:33:30,"Iceland has installed underfloor heating outdoors, nice outdoors, like, under the roads and"
00:33:30,00:33:31,tables.
00:33:31,00:33:32,Yeah.
00:33:32,00:33:35,It's got so much warm water just you just place the surface.
00:33:35,00:33:37,"They just have, they're stunning."
00:33:37,00:33:38,That's very clever.
00:33:38,00:33:39,Yeah.
00:33:39,00:33:40,It's very clever.
00:33:40,00:33:45,"They also have the, they grow more bananas in glass houses in Iceland than they do anywhere"
00:33:45,00:33:46,"else, which I think."
00:33:46,00:33:47,Really?
00:33:47,00:33:48,Yeah.
00:33:48,00:33:49,I know they don't.
00:33:49,00:33:53,So they aren't growing bananas commercially to sell because they don't actually have enough
00:33:53,00:33:59,"light to sort of the turnover of bananas to be good enough, but they do have a lot of geothermally"
00:33:59,00:34:00,heated greenhouses.
00:34:00,00:34:01,Right.
00:34:01,00:34:02,So I think they can get enough heat going.
00:34:02,00:34:08,"I think the greenhouses have to be around 20 degrees permanently to get the bananas to grow,"
00:34:08,00:34:12,but then to also be using the geothermal energy to provide enough light that the bananas
00:34:12,00:34:13,would also need.
00:34:13,00:34:14,Yeah.
00:34:14,00:34:15,It's just not commercially viable.
00:34:15,00:34:17,So they're like dark bananas that you can harvest?
00:34:17,00:34:18,Dark.
00:34:18,00:34:19,In the eight-month night.
00:34:19,00:34:26,"They'll put a bit of light on, but I just don't think it's enough because they need so much"
00:34:26,00:34:27,light.
00:34:27,00:34:28,Okay.
00:34:28,00:34:32,"But also tomatoes, various tropical fruits, algae, they've grown a lot of algae now using geothermal"
00:34:32,00:34:33,energy in Iceland.
00:34:33,00:34:34,Lovely.
00:34:34,00:34:37,Just scrape it off to get your spoon relieved of the superfood.
00:34:37,00:34:38,Yeah.
00:34:38,00:34:41,"In case you haven't picked it up really, I've got a reputation as the guy on the show who likes"
00:34:41,00:34:42,the boring stuff.
00:34:42,00:34:43,Oh.
00:34:43,00:34:48,It's just slightly unfair because we all like the barring stuff.
00:34:48,00:34:49,Yeah.
00:34:49,00:34:51,"They really get excited, don't they?"
00:34:51,00:34:55,"Underfloor heating, invented by the Romans."
00:34:55,00:35:00,They had like your house or your villa would be maybe a few metres above the ground or a
00:35:00,00:35:05,"metre above the ground, and then people would set fires or boil water underneath and that"
00:35:05,00:35:07,would get you on.
00:35:07,00:35:13,"But they put geothermal underfloor heating in Bath in the city of Bath in the UK, because"
00:35:13,00:35:16,down there there's quite a lot of hot springs and stuff.
00:35:16,00:35:20,"They could actually have, there's a few villas in Bath where you would get their geothermal"
00:35:20,00:35:21,stuff.
00:35:21,00:35:22,It's amazing.
00:35:22,00:35:26,"Isn't it incredible that ancient Rome 2,000 years ago has underfloor heating and yet I"
00:35:26,00:35:27,don't.
00:35:27,00:35:28,You don't know what I mean.
00:35:28,00:35:29,You can do it.
00:35:29,00:35:30,You can do it.
00:35:30,00:35:33,"It's such a pain of the bum to put in, you know?"
00:35:33,00:35:34,Yeah.
00:35:34,00:35:35,Yes.
00:35:35,00:35:37,Like why didn't they put it into my home whenever they were building it?
00:35:37,00:35:38,Yes.
00:35:38,00:35:39,What's going on?
00:35:39,00:35:40,Why is that?
00:35:40,00:35:42,"I think in the UK we don't necessarily need it that much, because we don't really get"
00:35:42,00:35:45,"very hot, very cold days."
00:35:45,00:35:52,"I had it in my home in South East London when I lived there in our bathroom, but as the"
00:35:52,00:35:56,builder was putting the final tile down he accidentally shredded one of the wires and
00:35:56,00:35:58,there was too expensive to do anything about it.
00:35:58,00:35:59,What do you mean?
00:35:59,00:36:00,We have read it.
00:36:00,00:36:01,He just said one of the shredded wheat machines.
00:36:01,00:36:02,That's amazing.
00:36:02,00:36:07,Basically he said that he did something to one of the wires and so it never worked.
00:36:07,00:36:08,Oh yeah.
00:36:08,00:36:09,But it was there.
00:36:09,00:36:10,So it's all there.
00:36:10,00:36:11,It's all there.
00:36:11,00:36:12,Just it never worked.
00:36:12,00:36:14,So we technically had it.
00:36:14,00:36:15,And we would always think about it.
00:36:15,00:36:20,It's been a big consolation as you walked in onto the freezing cold floor in the winter morning.
00:36:20,00:36:21,We would tell people who visited.
00:36:21,00:36:22,Then we got under a floor heating.
00:36:22,00:36:23,It doesn't work.
00:36:23,00:36:24,But we have it.
00:36:24,00:36:25,Yeah.
00:36:25,00:36:26,Did he still pay him?
00:36:26,00:36:27,Yeah.
00:36:27,00:36:28,Yeah.
00:36:28,00:36:29,"I mean, he was."
00:36:29,00:36:30,He's still working.
00:36:30,00:36:31,It doesn't work.
00:36:31,00:36:32,It's a scary trait.
00:36:32,00:36:33,It's fault wires break.
00:36:33,00:36:34,Wow.
00:36:34,00:36:35,Wow.
00:36:35,00:36:36,It doesn't make me think though.
00:36:36,00:36:41,"You know, like if someone in the past had made a slightly different decision, it would"
00:36:41,00:36:45,we be using geothermal energy more across the world because obviously there are some places
00:36:45,00:36:48,where it makes sense to use it because it's easier to access.
00:36:48,00:36:54,"But I guess if you drill down deep enough, eventually you are going to tap into geothermal"
00:36:54,00:36:55,energy.
00:36:55,00:36:58,So why is it we're not using it more because it does make an awful lot of sense?
00:36:58,00:36:59,It's just a pain to get down.
00:36:59,00:37:00,It's just a pain to drill.
00:37:00,00:37:01,It's an initial pain.
00:37:01,00:37:02,That's the process.
00:37:02,00:37:04,It's very expensive to set up.
00:37:04,00:37:05,Exactly.
00:37:05,00:37:09,And if you do it the old way where you're looking for quite a hot magma field.
00:37:09,00:37:10,Yeah.
00:37:10,00:37:13,"If you go deep enough anywhere, you're going to get hot."
00:37:13,00:37:17,But what they want to do is find somewhere that's not that deep and dig down.
00:37:17,00:37:19,Those places are really hard to find.
00:37:19,00:37:23,"It's not like, you know, it's obvious because these trees grow there, so it's going to be"
00:37:23,00:37:24,there.
00:37:24,00:37:27,But you basically have to keep digging until you find the right place.
00:37:27,00:37:28,Right.
00:37:28,00:37:34,"And there's recently, they've used AI in Nevada to find these zones where you can dig"
00:37:34,00:37:35,into.
00:37:35,00:37:37,And they don't really know how the AI's found it.
00:37:37,00:37:41,They're basically putting all the information of all the different zones around the world
00:37:41,00:37:45,where you can get this easy geothermal energy.
00:37:45,00:37:48,And the AI models have just found the signal out of the noise.
00:37:48,00:37:52,It's just like they've worked out where it is even though they're not quite sure how they
00:37:52,00:37:53,did it.
00:37:53,00:37:54,But it does work.
00:37:54,00:37:55,Wow.
00:37:55,00:37:56,It's one good use of it.
00:37:56,00:37:57,Yeah.
00:37:57,00:38:03,And now they've got enough energy from the geothermal to pay for one AI question.
00:38:03,00:38:09,"As we said, it's tricky to do everywhere because digging down is expensive and it's more economical"
00:38:09,00:38:13,"if there's lots of heat closer to the surface, which is only true in a few places."
00:38:13,00:38:16,So there are lots of things being tried to get around this now.
00:38:16,00:38:20,One of them is just most heat you need unless it's like industrial heat for a factory is
00:38:20,00:38:21,actually pretty low.
00:38:21,00:38:26,"And so that's these boreholes, the ground source heat pump thing, like China's going gangbusters"
00:38:26,00:38:27,on that.
00:38:27,00:38:30,And there are other kind of wacky versions of geothermal.
00:38:30,00:38:35,"There's enhanced, there's advanced, and there's super critical hot rock."
00:38:35,00:38:36,Okay.
00:38:36,00:38:37,I'm going to choose the last one.
00:38:37,00:38:39,That's a cool kind of rock music.
00:38:39,00:38:40,Yeah.
00:38:40,00:38:41,That should be a genre.
00:38:41,00:38:42,"Yeah, I should know."
00:38:42,00:38:46,So here's an idea that's being experimented with.
00:38:46,00:38:51,"You drill a couple of holes, you drill down a mile or two, right?"
00:38:51,00:38:53,Two separate shafts.
00:38:53,00:38:56,"You then drill sideways between the shafts, okay?"
00:38:56,00:38:57,So you've joined them up.
00:38:57,00:38:59,You've made a sort of like a U shape.
00:38:59,00:39:00,Like a U shape.
00:39:00,00:39:02,Exactly.
00:39:02,00:39:08,"Then you pump water down hole one, and you pumping it towards hole number two, and you're sort"
00:39:08,00:39:11,of cracking the rocks along the way.
00:39:11,00:39:15,"And the water is taking all the heat out of these rather hot rocks, and then the water is"
00:39:15,00:39:19,"pumped out of a second well, and it's at 200 degrees Celsius."
00:39:19,00:39:23,"How can it be at 200 degrees water, boils at 100 degrees?"
00:39:23,00:39:25,"Ah, must be high pressure."
00:39:25,00:39:27,It's high pressure.
00:39:27,00:39:28,It's really high pressure.
00:39:28,00:39:35,"So you get this thing, you get super heated, sort of super critical steam, which can drive"
00:39:35,00:39:39,"a turbine extremely well, or you just use that heat to actually heat up other water,"
00:39:39,00:39:40,which then drives a turbine.
00:39:40,00:39:42,Like there are different methods of doing it.
00:39:42,00:39:43,"It's very, very cool."
00:39:43,00:39:46,"It's actually quite similar to fracking, isn't it?"
00:39:46,00:39:47,It's basically fracking.
00:39:47,00:39:48,It's basically fracking.
00:39:48,00:39:52,"So they use the technology that fracking did to get oil out, but instead of doing that,"
00:39:52,00:39:54,they put water in and heated it up.
00:39:54,00:39:55,Exactly.
00:39:55,00:39:56,Exactly.
00:39:56,00:39:59,"Well, that happy about it, because fracking can cause earthquakes."
00:39:59,00:40:00,Yes.
00:40:00,00:40:01,Right.
00:40:01,00:40:02,So yeah.
00:40:02,00:40:03,But is it a better way to use fracking technology potentially?
00:40:03,00:40:04,"Well, undoubtedly."
00:40:04,00:40:05,Yeah.
00:40:05,00:40:08,"Because you're getting, it's much greener."
00:40:08,00:40:12,"Another way you can do it is instead of using water, you might be able to use hydrogen."
00:40:12,00:40:16,This is something called the Johnson Thermoelectric Energy Converter.
00:40:16,00:40:20,"And the best thing about it is it's solid state, so you put it into the water, and it's just"
00:40:20,00:40:25,"one object, you put it in, and then it gets electricity out of it."
00:40:25,00:40:30,"And it was invented by a guy called Lonnie Johnson, who also invented the super-soaker."
00:40:30,00:40:32,Isn't that amazing?
00:40:32,00:40:36,I thought I recognized that name for someone.
00:40:36,00:40:37,Yeah.
00:40:37,00:40:38,Wow.
00:40:38,00:40:43,"It's very, very, at the moment, they're not using it, but it might be used in the future."
00:40:43,00:40:50,"And this guy is, wants to use it in L.A., where they have a lot of, like, old oil wells,"
00:40:50,00:40:54,"so they've already got the holes down there, so you can just put stuff down there."
00:40:54,00:40:57,"The moment the temperature in those oil wells is too low, and you can't really get much"
00:40:57,00:41:01,"geothermal out, but because this is so efficient, you might be able to use it."
00:41:01,00:41:02,That's interesting.
00:41:02,00:41:05,"By anyway, he invented the super-soaker, so I mean, yeah."
00:41:05,00:41:09,"The difference in those two inventions is, like, the equivalent of Einstein doing E equals"
00:41:09,00:41:10,M to E square.
00:41:10,00:41:13,"It's, like, what are you going to do for his next equation?"
00:41:13,00:41:15,Viva 6 afraid of 7.
00:41:15,00:41:16,789?
00:41:16,00:41:19,"Like, that's that similarity."
00:41:19,00:41:28,"Okay, it's time for our final fact to the show, and that is James."
00:41:28,00:41:29,Okay.
00:41:29,00:41:37,"My fact this week is that in Peru, you can be sued by a B."
00:41:37,00:41:45,And he's got 20 million witnesses.
00:41:45,00:41:49,I don't really know. It has to be a stingless B.
00:41:49,00:41:56,"It has to be in one of two parts of Peru, the town of Sapito, or the Loretto department,"
00:41:56,00:41:59,but they're both in the Amazon.
00:41:59,00:42:05,"And it turns out that these areas have stingless bees that are very, very important to indigenous"
00:42:05,00:42:11,"communities, and they've been hurt by pollution, climate change, habitat loss, all that kind"
00:42:11,00:42:12,of stuff.
00:42:12,00:42:16,"So, these two areas of Peru have given them rights."
00:42:16,00:42:22,"And while the B cup fill out the paperwork, a human can act on their behalf."
00:42:22,00:42:26,"And so, if, like, let's say, a tree-felling company comes into the Amazon, cuts down a load"
00:42:26,00:42:35,"of habitat of these bees, then a environmental company can go over and sue them on behalf"
00:42:35,00:42:36,of the bees.
00:42:36,00:42:38,Can I sue a B?
00:42:38,00:42:39,"Yeah, if they have rights."
00:42:39,00:42:42,And just those two places.
00:42:42,00:42:43,They're stingless.
00:42:43,00:42:46,"So, I think the best they could do is give you a little nibble."
00:42:46,00:42:47,They can bite.
00:42:47,00:42:48,Those bees can bite.
00:42:48,00:42:49,Why are you going to sue them?
00:42:49,00:42:53,I'm just trying to work out what this new right has given them as a flip-byde coin.
00:42:53,00:42:54,It's fine.
00:42:54,00:42:55,It's fine.
00:42:55,00:42:56,It's fine.
00:42:56,00:42:57,It's fine.
00:42:57,00:42:58,Yeah.
00:42:58,00:42:59,Sorry.
00:42:59,00:43:00,It's a cup breakdown.
00:43:00,00:43:01,But classic.
00:43:01,00:43:02,A hive chaser.
00:43:02,00:43:06,"But also, can you sue a single B? Or does it have to be the colony?"
00:43:06,00:43:07,Oh.
00:43:07,00:43:12,"See, I wonder if you can take up a personal agreement with A-B."
00:43:12,00:43:13,A-B.
00:43:13,00:43:16,"Rowan Atkinson has just made a very successful series about this, isn't it?"
00:43:16,00:43:17,"Oh, yeah."
00:43:17,00:43:18,Man vs B.
00:43:18,00:43:22,"They don't cover series two of Man vs B, which is just the legal battle after this."
00:43:22,00:43:23,Set in the Amazon.
00:43:23,00:43:24,Yeah.
00:43:24,00:43:26,They did some cool these bees.
00:43:26,00:43:27,They're amazing.
00:43:27,00:43:29,There's one big lie about stingless bees.
00:43:29,00:43:30,Yeah.
00:43:30,00:43:31,They do have stings.
00:43:31,00:43:32,What?
00:43:32,00:43:33,"Yes, they do."
00:43:33,00:43:34,I didn't know this.
00:43:34,00:43:36,"I mean, I didn't know the stingless bee was a thing until this week."
00:43:36,00:43:39,That's a roller coaster that you've been on.
00:43:39,00:43:40,"Oh, my God."
00:43:40,00:43:41,There's a thing called a stingless bee.
00:43:41,00:43:42,"Oh, my God."
00:43:42,00:43:43,They have stings.
00:43:43,00:43:44,I know.
00:43:44,00:43:45,I did.
00:43:45,00:43:46,I thought are the harmless.
00:43:46,00:43:47,But they're not.
00:43:47,00:43:50,"So the stings are called degenerate stings, because they're so small and ineffective that"
00:43:50,00:43:51,they don't count.
00:43:51,00:43:52,No.
00:43:52,00:43:53,I know.
00:43:53,00:43:56,"But they do, as you said, Dan, they bite like the devil."
00:43:56,00:44:01,"They'll do suicidal biting, which is a biological term, which is where they bite and bite"
00:44:01,00:44:02,and bite and bite.
00:44:02,00:44:03,Yeah.
00:44:03,00:44:04,You.
00:44:04,00:44:05,Just you.
00:44:05,00:44:06,Yeah.
00:44:06,00:44:14,"Going after the bees, they're coming view Dan."
00:44:14,00:44:18,"And basically, they will keep biting and if you try and pull them away, yeah."
00:44:18,00:44:21,They will suffer fatal damage to their body rather than stop biting.
00:44:21,00:44:22,Okay.
00:44:22,00:44:23,They head off.
00:44:23,00:44:24,"Yeah, exactly."
00:44:24,00:44:25,Yeah.
00:44:25,00:44:30,So they will just clamp down their jaws with so much vigor that they just will not let
00:44:30,00:44:31,go.
00:44:31,00:44:33,Like a dangerous dog.
00:44:33,00:44:34,Like a dangerous dog.
00:44:34,00:44:37,"You know, they always say that the dogs will clamp onto you and they won't like go unless"
00:44:37,00:44:39,you put your finger up the body.
00:44:39,00:44:40,That is true.
00:44:40,00:44:43,And I don't suppose you could do that with a bee.
00:44:43,00:44:44,No.
00:44:44,00:44:48,And there's a useless thing in the way.
00:44:48,00:44:50,But those are suicidal tendencies.
00:44:50,00:44:52,We see that in bees' withstings as well.
00:44:52,00:44:53,"Oh, really?"
00:44:53,00:44:59,"So the bees that we have in here in Europe, in UK, aethysmelaferra, they will sting you."
00:44:59,00:45:03,"But sadly, when they sting you, the sting will, the barbs will get stuck in your skin"
00:45:03,00:45:05,and this essentially rips out their abdomen.
00:45:05,00:45:06,Right.
00:45:06,00:45:09,So I guess we're seeing the same behavior in the stingless bee.
00:45:09,00:45:13,It's just that they are physically choosing to not let go when they could.
00:45:13,00:45:18,"So that instinct to protect is so intense that, yeah, you're a beekeeper, aren't you?"
00:45:18,00:45:19,Yeah.
00:45:19,00:45:20,How many?
00:45:20,00:45:21,How many have you got?
00:45:21,00:45:22,"70,000."
00:45:22,00:45:23,What?
00:45:23,00:45:24,It's all there.
00:45:24,00:45:25,And their names are.
00:45:25,00:45:26,"70,000."
00:45:26,00:45:27,"Yeah, I'd say."
00:45:27,00:45:28,I'd say that.
00:45:28,00:45:29,Yeah.
00:45:29,00:45:30,How many hives is that?
00:45:30,00:45:35,"That's at the moment because it's January, so the hives, they significantly decrease in numbers"
00:45:35,00:45:36,over the winter.
00:45:36,00:45:39,"But yeah, I would say in the height of the summer, around 70,000."
00:45:39,00:45:40,So cool.
00:45:40,00:45:41,And gals.
00:45:41,00:45:43,Have you been stung?
00:45:43,00:45:44,Many times.
00:45:44,00:45:45,I've seen you.
00:45:45,00:45:46,Many times.
00:45:46,00:45:47,Yeah.
00:45:47,00:45:48,So certainly do have stings.
00:45:48,00:45:50,Where's the most painful spot?
00:45:50,00:45:51,"Oh, painful."
00:45:51,00:45:53,The most annoying was on my forehead.
00:45:53,00:45:55,I sort of looked like a Star Trek character.
00:45:55,00:45:57,I remember that for quite some time.
00:45:57,00:45:58,That took a long time to go down.
00:45:58,00:46:02,"I do have to be careful, though, because every time I get stung, I think I'm reacting a little"
00:46:02,00:46:05,"bit more every single time, so I do need to be cautious."
00:46:05,00:46:06,Yeah.
00:46:06,00:46:07,That's very cool.
00:46:07,00:46:09,And do you use the honey for yourself?
00:46:09,00:46:12,Do you sell it in local shops and farm markets?
00:46:12,00:46:13,"No, no."
00:46:13,00:46:18,"I would say, I would say, only just about get enough honey to sort of maybe get me through"
00:46:18,00:46:19,a few months.
00:46:19,00:46:20,Okay.
00:46:20,00:46:26,"So me, extracting the honey is, it's something that has been developed over hundreds and"
00:46:26,00:46:30,"more than thousands of years, the bees, they will store their honey in honeycomb."
00:46:30,00:46:36,We encourage them to store that honey in frames that can be easily removed from the hive.
00:46:36,00:46:39,"But stingless bees, you can also harvest their honey."
00:46:39,00:46:44,"It's just much harder, because stingless bees don't make honeycomb."
00:46:44,00:46:49,"Instead, they store their honey in little sort of tiny honey pots that are about the size"
00:46:49,00:46:54,"of grapes, and they're all, yeah, so they're all sort of like a little Winnie the Pooh."
00:46:54,00:46:55,Yeah.
00:46:55,00:46:56,They're all nested together.
00:46:56,00:46:57,What's it made of?
00:46:57,00:46:58,What's the pot?
00:46:58,00:47:03,"So it's, it's similar to a sort of a sticky substance that European bees make, which is"
00:47:03,00:47:09,"called propolis, which is a combination of wax, but you also get various tree sats and"
00:47:09,00:47:15,"resins as well in the mix, so it kind of makes a bee polypillar material."
00:47:15,00:47:19,"And, but if you want to harvest the honey, to not destroy the hive, you would have to"
00:47:19,00:47:24,go in with a pipette or a syringe and individually sort of go into these little honey pots and take
00:47:24,00:47:25,them and take the honey out.
00:47:25,00:47:26,That's amazing.
00:47:26,00:47:28,"You can't harvest it, just a lot more time can see."
00:47:28,00:47:31,"And I think that people buy it and it's very, very expensive, right?"
00:47:31,00:47:32,Yeah.
00:47:32,00:47:35,"I would assume so, because it's so labelled as stingless bee honey."
00:47:35,00:47:40,"Yeah, and it's been used like for medicine by, you know, indigenous people for hundreds"
00:47:40,00:47:41,"of years, I'm sure."
00:47:41,00:47:42,Yeah.
00:47:42,00:47:45,"They use it for, what do they use it for?"
00:47:45,00:47:49,"They use it for, if you've got like a cough, if you've got some flam on your, on your"
00:47:49,00:47:53,"chest, they use it for that, like we would with honey, I suppose, but also for infertility"
00:47:53,00:47:58,"rheumatism, anemia and arthritis, and they make alcohol out of it."
00:47:58,00:47:59,Right.
00:47:59,00:48:05,"And if you want to go and harvest it, according to locals, if on a full moon night you grab"
00:48:05,00:48:10,"a queen bee, squeeze her abdomen and smear the liquid that comes out of it, her onto your"
00:48:10,00:48:17,"eyelids, then you'll be able to temporarily see every bee's nest in the forest in the dark."
00:48:17,00:48:18,Right.
00:48:18,00:48:19,Right.
00:48:19,00:48:23,"If you're ever in the Amazon, that's pretty cool."
00:48:23,00:48:24,I'm not sure it's entirely true.
00:48:24,00:48:26,I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure I love it though.
00:48:26,00:48:27,Sounds legit.
00:48:27,00:48:29,"And your bees are all gals, do you say?"
00:48:29,00:48:30,Yeah.
00:48:30,00:48:35,"Well, I mean, because you've got a queen and then all the girls and they're the drones, workers,"
00:48:35,00:48:36,workers.
00:48:36,00:48:41,"So all the work bees are female and then she'll keep a couple of lads around, but really"
00:48:41,00:48:46,their only purpose is to go off and mate with a queen from another hive.
00:48:46,00:48:48,"So to be honest, the boys don't do anything."
00:48:48,00:48:50,They are really very useless.
00:48:50,00:48:51,Have you met the boys?
00:48:51,00:48:54,"You can see them, they're sort of they're much larger, they're quite clumsy, they kind of"
00:48:54,00:48:57,"just daughter about really doing anything, getting in the way."
00:48:57,00:49:03,"They're the bees, Maddie, the bees, you know what I'm talking about."
00:49:03,00:49:04,"So yeah, there aren't many."
00:49:04,00:49:07,"And actually the girls will kick them out, come September."
00:49:07,00:49:08,Yeah.
00:49:08,00:49:09,They get them out.
00:49:09,00:49:10,They're not useful anymore.
00:49:10,00:49:11,Where did they go?
00:49:11,00:49:12,They die.
00:49:12,00:49:13,They're on the floor.
00:49:13,00:49:14,Yeah.
00:49:14,00:49:19,"So it's actually, it's the cleaner bees or the undertaker bees."
00:49:19,00:49:22,"In fact, they get called, it's their responsibility to take out the dead."
00:49:22,00:49:26,"So quite often, sort of as you're approaching the winter months, you'll just see just a graveyard"
00:49:26,00:49:29,"of bees in front of the hive, so they've all been taken out just to make sure things are"
00:49:29,00:49:30,clean for the winter.
00:49:30,00:49:31,Yeah.
00:49:31,00:49:32,Wow.
00:49:32,00:49:35,I've got the case of a goat suing a pig here.
00:49:35,00:49:36,Oh yeah.
00:49:36,00:49:37,Okay.
00:49:37,00:49:38,Yep.
00:49:38,00:49:39,Gone.
00:49:39,00:49:40,2014.
00:49:40,00:49:41,The pig is pepper pig.
00:49:41,00:49:42,Oh yeah.
00:49:42,00:49:43,And the goat is Gabriela Capra.
00:49:43,00:49:44,Oh yes.
00:49:44,00:49:45,Capra.
00:49:45,00:49:50,"Who's name in Italian means Gabriela Goat, and the character in pepper pig called Gabriela"
00:49:50,00:49:55,"Goat, and then the Italian pepper pig, she's Gabriela Capra, and she said, she needed a hundred"
00:49:55,00:49:57,thousand euros to compensate her because she was annoyed.
00:49:57,00:49:58,And use her name.
00:49:58,00:49:59,Use her name.
00:49:59,00:50:00,Oh right.
00:50:00,00:50:02,It doesn't look like she got it.
00:50:02,00:50:05,"The case goes very, very quiet after a blizzard of publicity."
00:50:05,00:50:06,Yeah.
00:50:06,00:50:12,"But in 2022, the owners of pepper pig themselves sued a Vietnamese firm, which had made a very,"
00:50:12,00:50:16,"very, very similar looking and feeling franchise, called Wolfu."
00:50:16,00:50:20,So that's three little pigs suing a wolf.
00:50:20,00:50:21,Oh.
00:50:21,00:50:22,That's good for it.
00:50:22,00:50:23,Yeah.
00:50:23,00:50:25,"I was a family of four in pepper pig, but yeah, that's..."
00:50:25,00:50:26,Yeah.
00:50:26,00:50:27,I don't think the younger kids.
00:50:27,00:50:28,"Someone says, part of the morsi."
00:50:28,00:50:29,I was trying to...
00:50:29,00:50:30,Sorry.
00:50:30,00:50:31,The pepper is.
00:50:31,00:50:33,Oh my god.
00:50:33,00:50:34,You're trying to do something.
00:50:34,00:50:36,You're trying to do something.
00:50:36,00:50:41,"I started looking at just generally the rights of other animals, and I couldn't find"
00:50:41,00:50:46,many examples where animals had been given the equivalent to human rights.
00:50:46,00:50:52,"There certainly are some that exist, but I was able to find quite a few examples where"
00:50:52,00:50:57,animals are being protected from humans doing stupid things in Alaska to protect these
00:50:57,00:50:59,hibernating bears.
00:50:59,00:51:05,"The US have enacted a law saying it's completely illegal to wake a bear for a photo, but it is"
00:51:05,00:51:06,okay to hunt them.
00:51:06,00:51:07,Okay.
00:51:07,00:51:13,That feels like it's protecting the photographer.
00:51:13,00:51:14,Yeah.
00:51:14,00:51:15,"Yeah, of course, of course."
00:51:15,00:51:16,You can't be allowed to shoot a hibernating bear.
00:51:16,00:51:17,You would hope so.
00:51:17,00:51:19,You would hope that a hibernating bear is protected regardless of...
00:51:19,00:51:26,"If you're out there right now, listening, as you take aim, for two feet away, grow up, mate."
00:51:26,00:51:31,They said it's okay to take a photo selfie with a completely awake bear.
00:51:31,00:51:32,"Yeah, fine."
00:51:32,00:51:33,All right.
00:51:33,00:51:34,Actively encouraged.
00:51:34,00:51:40,"But also in Alaska, not just thinking about the bears here, we're also protecting moose."
00:51:40,00:51:42,You are not allowed to push one out of an aeroplane.
00:51:42,00:51:44,Just in case you ever had it.
00:51:44,00:51:45,You ever considered it.
00:51:45,00:51:46,"Oh, yeah."
00:51:46,00:51:47,Not allowed.
00:51:47,00:51:48,I'm police ready to go now.
00:51:48,00:51:49,Yeah.
00:51:49,00:51:50,Yeah.
00:51:50,00:51:51,Yeah.
00:51:51,00:51:52,Okay.
00:51:52,00:51:53,That's it.
