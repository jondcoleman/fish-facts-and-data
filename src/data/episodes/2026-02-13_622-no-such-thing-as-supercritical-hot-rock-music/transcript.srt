00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:06,240
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Things A Fish,

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,400
 where we were joined by the brilliant Maddie Motte.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,400
 Now, if you have children of a certain age,

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,320
 then you will know exactly who Maddie is.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,480
 She is often seen on the BBC doing various kid shows,

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,360
 especially once related to science communication.

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,600
 But if you want to know more about her having heard her today on this show,

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,640
 and I'm absolutely certain you will, then the best thing to do

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,880
 is to go to her YouTube channel.

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,880
 So Maddie's YouTube channel is all about curiosity.

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,680
 It's all about animals, about plants, about travel,

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,120
 about technology.

14
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,360
 She is really right up her street.

15
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,040
 She loves everything about knowledge,

16
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,120
 and her videos are absolutely fantastic.

17
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,400
 And if you want to find them,

18
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,960
 then go to youtube.com/maddiemote,

19
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,320
 that's M-A-A-D-I-E-M-O-A-T-E,

20
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,800
 or just search for Maddie's name on the internet.

21
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,280

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,840
 and what we're up to at the moment and in the future,

23
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,800

00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,160

25
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,600
 you can sign up there.

27
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,960
 It is a place to get little free bits of pieces here and there

28
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,560
 and learn about what's going on.

29
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,840
 And then, of course, on top of that,

30
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,440
 we do have our various tiers.

 really hope you enjoyed this show,

42
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,640
 with the Fantastic Maddie Mote.

43
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,840
 On with the podcast.

44
00:01:45,840 --> 00:02:02,960
 [Music]

45
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,080
 Hello and welcome to another episode

46
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,680
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

47
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,360
 a weekly podcast coming to you

48
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,440
 from the QI offices in Hobern.

49
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,560
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

50
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,640
 I'm sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

51
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,720
 James Harkin, and Maddie Mote.

52
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,720
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

53
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,440
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

54
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,400
 And in a particular order, here we go.

55
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,440
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Maddie.

56
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,360
 Okay, so I thought I could pose this fact as a question,

57
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,040
 sort of a bit of a guessing game.

58
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,800
 So the fact is, in 1988,

59
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,320
 one particular company had to recall 30 million flutes.

60
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,240
 That is obviously important.

61
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,520
 It's a lot of instruments.

62
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,000
 Yeah, yeah.

63
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,120
 So the question is,

64
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,880
 who is this company?

65
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,920
 - Flute makers. - Flute makers.

66
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,200
 - Flute makers. - Obviously.

67
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,000
 - Yeah. - Flute makers.

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,080
 - And they didn't put all the holes in.

69
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,000
 - They didn't, okay. - Oh, good call.

70
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,200
 It's all those flutes.

71
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,280
 It's just a stick, really, that they say now.

72
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,800
 - I was thinking too many holes.

73
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,800
 - Oh, okay. - Can you have too many holes

74
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,240
 in a flute, definitely.

75
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,680
 - Yeah. - Can you?

76
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,960
 - Absolutely. - I think so.

77
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,320
 I think it becomes a different instrument.

78
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,720
 - It's only a better flute up to a point.

79
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,480
 - Yeah, yeah. - I think so.

80
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,800
 - I mean, you need your hands over the holes, don't you?

81
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,320
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - So you'd run out of fingers.

82
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,000
 - Oh, but if you had a spare set of hands,

83
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,520
 like a pantomine flute, you know,

84
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,640
 there's someone running the lower bit of the flute.

85
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,680
 - A double flute.

86
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,160
 Is that not a flute that go in both directions?

87
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,000
 - Like Darth Maul's lightsaber.

88
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,880
 - Yeah. (laughing)

89
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,720
 - I feel we've stepped away for another question.

90
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,840
 - To help you out, these flutes

91
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,000
 were actually branded cool flutes.

92
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,960
 So I don't know if that has anything to do with helmets.

93
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,360
 For kids, yeah, yeah, well for younger people.

94
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,160
 And actually, it wasn't just flutes that were recalled,

95
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,880
 but also binoculars that were a little cardboard boxes

96
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,840
 with plastic lenses.

97
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,360
 They were recalled at the same time.

98
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,640
 - Okay, McDonald's.

99
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,760
 - Yeah, I think you're on the mat track.

100
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,440
 - Okay, Burger King.

101
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,440
 (laughing)

102
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,800
 - So I could take, I'll go on out.

103
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,000
 - Used to get toys in cereal.

104
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,080
 - Absolutely, so there you go, bingo.

105
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,800
 So these cool flutes, they were actually found

106
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,560
 in boxes of corn pops.

107
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,640
 And they were recalled by Kellogg's, Kellogg cereal.

108
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,640
 So it turns out these cool flutes,

109
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,480
 they were made up of two little tubes

110
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,800
 that sort of went into a mouthpiece.

111
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,640
 And these tubes, they could fall out

112
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,160
 and they were a choking hazard.

113
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,760
 So they had to recall 30--

114
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,520
 - You know what, they could have done with those flutes.

115
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,320
 Mar holes.

116
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,440
 (laughing)

117
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,360
 - So the reason I was looking at this in the first place

118
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,160
 is because I've been, I guess, fairly interested

119
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,560
 in just this whole world of collectible toys recently

120
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,960
 because it feels like we're getting a bit of a resurgence,

121
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,400
 the idea of blind boxes, toy collectibles is coming back.

122
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,200
 - Oh, yeah.

123
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,880
 - I was thinking, it was so, you know,

124
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,640
 what was my equivalent when I was younger

125
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,800
 in that for me was cereal box toys.

126
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,400
 But then I sort of just started looking

127
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,560
 at the history of cereal box toys

128
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,880
 and the toys were kind of fascinating.

129
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,160
 Like, do you remember any particular toys?

130
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,880
 - I think maybe my earliest ever memory

131
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,600
 is getting some Ghostbusters stickers

132
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,880
 from out of the cereal when the film came out.

133
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,480
 - Wow. - So that was like early 80s, right?

134
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,280
 - Yeah.

135
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,240
 I don't think I was allowed to get the kind of cereals

136
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,840
 which came with toys in them.

137
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,000
 - Oh, no, they didn't have them in all branded day.

138
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,080
 (laughing)

139
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,320
 - They just give you a little leaflet about your mortgage.

140
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,960
 And that's the fun for you to read and find out.

141
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,720
 - It's time for that me to fix this.

142
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,560
 - What about you, Daniel?

143
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,560
 Did you ever get any?

144
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,280
 - I remember the whole enjoyment and excitement

145
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,120
 of getting them.

146
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,560
 Right now I'm drawing a blank on the exact toys.

147
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,560
 But I do remember, like, quite often

148
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,240
 they were within the pack itself.

149
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,560
 You had to open up the plastic

150
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,280
 and you had to go through the fruit loops

151
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,280
 and a lot of families had a policy

152
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,160
 that you had to wait till it fell out during a war.

153
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,560
 As opposed to just getting right in and grabbing it.

154
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,760
 - Totally, it was whoever poured it into their bowl.

155
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,080
 So that was the unwritten rule in our society.

156
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,960
 - And you're an only child, aren't you?

157
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,360
 So you wouldn't have had this issue.

158
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,640
 But obviously, if you've got three or four kids

159
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,560
 and you've only got one tie in a pack.

160
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,400
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

161
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,400
 - Yeah, that's a big deal.

162
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,320
 - Yeah, but I think that's fair enough

163
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,160
 the pouring out thing.

164
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,240
 Like, you don't allow to plunge your hand

165
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,160
 into the Christmas pudding

166
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,840
 to allow the sick to sleep in.

167
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,840
 That's not allowed.

168
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,680
 (laughing)

169
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,920
 - I think I'd more incited to add these childhood.

170
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,000
 (laughing)

171
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,920
 Like, one really interesting thing is

172
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,320
 the people who made them had to make them a certain weight.

173
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,680
 And that is because of something

174
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,160
 called the Brazil Nut Effect.

175
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,280
 That if you get lots of things

176
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,920
 that are different sizes and different weights

177
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,120
 and you jiggle them around,

178
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,680
 eventually the bigger things will end up at the top

179
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,840
 and the smaller things will end up at the bottom.

180
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,120
 And this is something that's,

181
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,520
 you see this in all sorts of places,

182
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,360
 even like in avalanches,

183
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,440
 like the big bits of snow

184
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,280
 will be at the top and the small bits of the bottom.

185
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,080
 But they had this specific size and weight of these toys

186
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,120
 so that they knew that if they were jiggled around

187
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,120
 in transport, the toy would always be kind of in the middle.

188
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,120
 - Ah, that was nice.

189
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,160
 - Ah, I didn't know that.

190
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,640
 - Yes, what was yours?

191
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,480
 You haven't given us your idea.

192
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,200
 - Well, so I remember the color changing spoon

193
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,480
 that I got in cocoa pops.

194
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,480
 - It's you. - Thank you.

195
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,480
 - Yeah, so when it would go into the cold milk,

196
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,520
 it would change color.

197
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,360
 - Oh my god.

198
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,840
 - But actually, one of those looking

199
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,400
 at the various toys they have been over the years,

200
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,160
 it very much started out as China cereal bowls

201
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,360
 that you would have to send off by collecting tokens

202
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,920
 on the back of boxes.

203
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,440
 Then Kellogg sort of saw that they were doing

204
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,000
 this with quaker oats and Kellogg's were like,

205
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,080
 we can get on the back of this.

206
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,680
 So they started making these farm yard story books

207
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,440
 with various flaps that you could make

208
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,200
 funny animals out of.

209
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,800
 And then that sort of like started the spiral of,

210
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,800
 okay, well, what else,

211
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,320
 what toys can we put inside the packets?

212
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,520
 And actually, this was sort of,

213
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,440
 I guess it became extremely popular

214
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,560
 after the Second World War.

215
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,800
 So it's sort of looking at the atomic age.

216
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,560
 So a lot of early cereal box toys are quite,

217
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,680
 literally yes.

218
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,000
 - No, no, no.

219
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,840
 - What?

220
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,160
 - It's genuinely.

221
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,000
 - Oh my god.

222
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,960
 - But genuinely radioactive toys

223
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,960
 were placed inside cereal boxes.

224
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,200
 - Well, then you know where it is in the packet

225
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,360
 'cause you can see the glow.

226
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,520
 - Yeah.

227
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,120
 - When I was a kid that was at first,

228
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,120
 if you were at ReadyBrat,

229
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,280
 you would always have a glow around your whole body.

230
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,680
 I didn't realize it was a ReadyBrat.

231
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,520
 - Please.

232
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,920
 (laughing)

233
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,880
 - I remember if you had too much sunny delight,

234
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,320
 you sort of glowed orange,

235
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,160
 but I was a complete thing.

236
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,440
 - You were all showing that right here.

237
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,600
 - Yeah, yeah, totally.

238
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,560
 But this toy was called the Lone Ranger Atomic Bomb Ring.

239
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,560
 - genuinely.

240
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,400
 - Oh my god.

241
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,400
 - And you would get this inside Kix cereal,

242
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,160
 which you could get for 15 cents is in the US.

243
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,000
 - Wow.

244
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,320
 - It was a gold adjustable ring.

245
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,320
 There was a little removable cap

246
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,560
 at the back, a little red cap that you could take off,

247
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,280
 and that's where you could hide secret messages.

248
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,040
 But then it contained something called,

249
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,400
 now I think I'm saying this right,

250
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,760
 but a spin tharoscope.

251
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,760
 I don't know if anyone's heard of that before.

252
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,240
 It's basically a little device

253
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,000
 that would contain a small amount of radioactive material.

254
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,520
 So in this case, it's something called Pallonium 210.

255
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,360
 - I've heard of Pallonium.

256
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,520
 - There we go, Pallonium.

257
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,360
 (laughing)

258
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,480
 - Yeah, normally like Pallonium has been deployed

259
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,360
 on the streets of London,

260
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,680
 not free Pallonium, and you'll say, what?

261
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,600
 - So this was, you know, radioactive material

262
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,840
 discovered by Marikiri.

263
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,680
 Tiny small amounts of it were placed inside this ring,

264
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,280
 and then you would look into the atomic bomb

265
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,600
 through a little sort of lens that contains ink sulfide.

266
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,440
 - Right.

267
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,920
 - And as the Pallonium was decaying,

268
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,240
 obviously you've got alpha particles that are shedding,

269
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,200
 they're hitting the zinc sulfide screen,

270
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,520
 creating little flashes.

271
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,880
 So the idea is your child could look inside the ring

272
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,000
 and actually see the simulations

273
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,320
 of this radioactive material.

274
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,920
 - Yeah, it's the flute we recall.

275
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,080
 (laughing)

276
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,520
 - And because it had choking pieces,

277
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,720
 yet this ring could be sort of taken apart

278
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,720
 with small caps and things,

279
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,520
 and apparently that's fine.

280
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,200
 - That's extraordinary.

281
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,920
 - I read this about this on Snopes, the website,

282
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,000
 and they said that there wasn't enough in it

283
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,080
 to do you any harm?

284
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,920
 - Right.

285
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,000
 - Can I tell you guys my favorite serial promotion ever?

286
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,840
 - Please do.

287
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,680
 - Yeah, we all have one.

288
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,640
 - It's done by Quaker Oats.

289
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,480
 - Okay.

290
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,320
 - It's 1954.

291
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:45,720
 They bought 19 acres of land in Yukon,

292
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,600
 in the Yukon territory, gold rush country in Canada,

293
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,080
 and they divided up these 19 acres into

294
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,040
 21 million square inches.

295
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,880
 - Right.

296
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:00,760
 - 21 million property deeds, each one for one square inch,

297
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,440
 and if you sent in a box top,

298
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,720
 you would be sent a square inch of the Yukon.

299
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,560
 - Wow.

300
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,400
 - Wow.

301
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,240
 - How interesting.

302
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,080
 - When was this, Sandy?

303
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,080
 - 1954.

304
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,600
 - Okay. - It was not legally binding.

305
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,440
 - I'll come.

306
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,280
 - Oh really?

307
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,120
 - What does that mean?

308
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,400
 Could you go along and dig in that tiny little hatch?

309
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,920
 - Yeah, let's go.

310
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,120
 - We're like a team of your teaspoon,

311
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,480
 but you got in a serial box, man.

312
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,960
 - One boy who got one sent in four toothpicks

313
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,800
 on some string and he said,

314
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,600
 "Can you fence my end drop please?"

315
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,480
 (all laughing)

316
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,520
 - That's amazing. - So sweet.

317
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,840
 - People do collect these ties.

318
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,680
 Still don't they?

319
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,400
 I went on to eBay to see what kind of things I could buy

320
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,320
 from some little package. - Yeah, I did too.

321
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,400
 (all laughing)

322
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,480
 - Okay, what have we found?

323
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,680
 Maddie, what have you found?

324
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,080
 - Well, actually, it was the ring, the atomic bomb ring.

325
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:48,400
 I found with the box was going for $645.

326
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,920
 - The box makes a difference, doesn't it?

327
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,320
 - Yeah, it's huge difference.

328
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,000
 - And it's not like, you know, if you buy like a Marvel

329
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,960
 superhero figurine or something,

330
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,640
 it has to be inside the box.

331
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:01,360
 You just have the box next to it flattened with the tie next.

332
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,640
 - Oh, is that so that's the inside, the box or anything?

333
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,400
 I found one which was some cause monsters

334
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,600
 from Frank and Barry serial in America,

335
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,120
 and there were 1,700 pounds.

336
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,800
 - Wow. - Wow.

337
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,120
 - I don't see anything happening.

338
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,120
 - It feels like a lot.

339
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,960
 - Frank and Barry.

340
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,040
 - You know, Frank and Barry, if you come across them,

341
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,280
 was it the 90s I think in America they had them?

342
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,320
 And they were a bit like, what are those serials

343
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,520
 that have little marshmallows in that have like,

344
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,520
 got leprechauns on?

345
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,840
 - Lucky charms. - Lucky charms, yeah, yeah.

346
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,560
 So it was like that when it was monsters.

347
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,000
 And the marshmallows were like pink and purple and stuff.

348
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,920
 And the kids reat in it, and this die would go straight

349
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,920
 through them and come out of the toilet.

350
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,960
 And it looked like, you know, I've had this

351
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,440
 when my daughter eats beetroot.

352
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,440
 And I'm like, to my wife, believe it,

353
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,680
 believe it, we need to go to any of these.

354
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,440
 No, she had beetroot yesterday.

355
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,400
 But like it would come out and they had a thing called

356
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,560
 Frank and Barry stool that was in like medical papers

357
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,520
 saying, this is right.

358
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,720
 - It looks like people had blood in the paper.

359
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,720
 - Was this one of the serials

360
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,120
 that was basically 95% of sugar?

361
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:04,960
 - Yes.

362
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,720
 - With some, like, I don't want to say,

363
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,440
 'cause I think they might still be extant.

364
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,800
 But yeah, I think there was a lot of sugar in them.

365
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,600
 But the interesting thing about that is,

366
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,560
 so serials, Kellogg's, like the Kellogg's brothers,

367
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:19,200
 they had a sanatorium in North of America somewhere.

368
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,040
 - That's crazy.

369
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,400
 - But like, Battle Creek, that's it.

370
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,880
 And there were two brothers,

371
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,520
 and one of the brothers decided

372
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,360
 we're gonna start putting sugar in it

373
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,200
 in order to attract younger people to eat it

374
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,600
 and not just be a health food,

375
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,160
 and they really fell out over that.

376
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,800
 And they properly fell out.

377
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,040
 - But ultimately, it was the fact

378
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,400
 that these were sugary serials,

379
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,200
 which is why we stopped getting serial box toys.

380
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,920
 It was meant there were many factors,

381
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,800
 but one of them was the fact that these were

382
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,160
 slightly less nutritious foods.

383
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,800
 I think there was, there was a pledge,

384
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,000
 it was a voluntary pledge,

385
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,280
 which included the likes of General Mills and Kellogg's,

386
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,880
 they got together and they said,

387
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,400
 "Hey, you know what, it's not right for us

388
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,960
 "to push less nutritious foods at children,

389
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,920
 "which is why they started taking toys away."

390
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,880
 Although, first, they removed toys for children,

391
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,480
 but that's when they started putting in things

392
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,720
 like pedometers and reflective bike stickers.

393
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,480
 So they didn't sort of remove things on it.

394
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,480
 - Tell me more.

395
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,240
 (laughing)

396
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,440
 - But yeah, so that was kind of their attempt to be like,

397
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,840
 "Okay, we're not putting toys in them,

398
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,560
 "but we've had sports-related gifts in."

399
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,200
 - Can I tell you guys something about a friend of the podcast?

400
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,600
 - Yes. - So, Henry Perky,

401
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,680
 you guys might remember?

402
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,520
 - Yeah.

403
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,880
 - "Eventer of Shredded Wheat."

404
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,320
 - Yeah. - And father of the man

405
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,720
 who then invented round shredded wheat.

406
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,560
 - Okay. - Yeah, yeah.

407
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,080
 - Very much at Nipo-Serie last minute.

408
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,920
 - Absolutely.

409
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,080
 (laughing)

410
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,520
 - I thought it was knitted by Granny's.

411
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,720
 Can't believe it. (laughing)

412
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,880
 - A myth busted.

413
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,920
 (laughing)

414
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,840
 - But his initial intention was not

415
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,280
 making shredded wheat to sell them to people.

416
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,080
 He wanted everyone to buy shredded wheat making machines.

417
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,440
 This was his big thing.

418
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,280
 - Okay.

419
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,520
 - He created a machine which shredded wheat.

420
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,360
 And then people just said,

421
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,960
 "Can we have some more of the shredded wheat, please?"

422
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,920
 And he said, "Anyone of the machine that makes it?"

423
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,400
 So they could've been, well, we'll be all hedge on our counter.

424
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,440
 - Like a soda stream.

425
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,680
 - Yeah, exactly.

426
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,520
 - Or an average.

427
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,440
 - I just slightly ran him a question for you, Maddie.

428
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,600
 So when I first moved to Australia when I was 12,

429
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,800
 I became star-struck when I met the voice

430
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,120
 of the Australian cocoa pop monkey.

431
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,440
 - I know the British one.

432
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,000
 - Well, this is what I was gonna ask.

433
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,960
 You must know all of these people

434
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,120
 because of what you do.

435
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,960
 - Yeah.

436
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,400
 - The world of voices for these iconic characters.

437
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,240
 - This is so bizarre that you've asked me this

438
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,040
 because genuinely one of my best friends

439
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,200
 is the voice of the cocoa pop monkey.

440
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,040
 - Oh my God.

441
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,040
 - No, I'm not even kidding.

442
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,880
 - Oh my gosh.

443
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,880
 - I'm genuinely, yeah.

444
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,720
 - Why?

445
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,120
 - Yeah, he does really well from it.

446
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,680
 But the cocoa pop monkey doesn't talk so much anymore.

447
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,480
 So as far as I'm aware, every couple of years,

448
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,480
 they'll say, "Hey, can you come to the recording booth

449
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,080
 "and he'll just have to record a giggle?"

450
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,920
 (laughing)

451
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,760
 - Yeah, I was gonna say,

452
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,480
 I know that cocoa would recognize his voice.

453
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,000
 - No, Tony the Tiger is the one that I'm gonna say.

454
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,840
 - I would recognize it.

455
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,560
 If he was in the room next door,

456
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,920
 if I was in a restaurant,

457
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,800
 Tony the Tiger was at the next table.

458
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,800
 - You'd ask to be moved.

459
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,800
 - No, I would recognize it.

460
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,280
 - Oh, I think so, you know what I mean?

461
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,120
 (laughing)

462
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,400
 - Guy, he thinks everything's great.

463
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,720
 - Yeah.

464
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,960
 - The guy's soup is not great.

465
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,560
 (laughing)

466
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,680
 - Yeah.

467
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,120
 - As far as I know that in his many years

468
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,800
 of being the voice of the cocoa pop monkey, cocoa,

469
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,800
 I don't think the monkey talks much.

470
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,880
 Chocolatey goodness, something about 10 to the milk chocolatey.

471
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,400
 - Oh, you said that, yeah.

472
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,480
 - I think that was kind of the catchphrase.

473
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,440
 - That was a song when they briefly

474
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,720
 and ill-fatedly changed their name to chocolate crispies

475
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,600
 and then realized too late it didn't scan

476
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,800
 when I'd rather have a bowl of chocolate crispies.

477
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,520
 (laughing)

478
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,360
 - Thank you, back.

479
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,960
 (upbeat music)

480
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,480
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two

481
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,720
 and that is my fact.

482
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,200
 My fact this week is that after years of publicly arguing

483
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,920
 that the Milky Way is the only galaxy in the universe,

484
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,400
 one of Harvard University's head astronomers

485
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,400
 realized that actually he was wrong

486
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,600
 and then went on to map 76,000 galaxies.

487
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,440
 - So awkward.

488
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,440
 (laughing)

489
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,280
 - Who was he?

490
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,280
 - His name was Harlow Shapley.

491
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,560
 He lived 1885 to 1972, American astronomer,

492
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:15,120
 and he served as the head of the Harvard College Observatory.

493
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,720
 Now, what's amazing is up until the 1920s,

494
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,240
 most astronomers believe that our galaxy

495
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,440
 was the single galaxy in the universe.

496
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,280
 That was it.

497
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,920
 If we were expanding, it would have been into that.

498
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,640
 That was the idea of the time.

499
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,840
 So, suddenly a few scientists started coming up

500
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,560
 saying actually I think it might be a bit bigger.

501
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,640
 One of whom was Edwin Hubble.

502
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:39,520
 And Shapley really thought that this was junk science.

503
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,680
 He took part in a debate with a man called Curtis

504
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,360
 where they both presented their findings

505
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,480
 to say whether or not it was the case

506
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,640
 and he stuck with it.

507
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:50,920
 And so it wasn't until Hubble eventually showed him proof

508
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,040
 by sending him a letter of something that he discovered

509
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,360
 that he then said this is completely destroyed my universe

510
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,800
 and accepted it, which is the wonderful thing about science.

511
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,640
 It's not opinion.

512
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,920
 If the facts are in front of you, you can go onto map 76,000 galaxies.

513
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,720
 So, it's quite nice.

514
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,640
 That is such a good quote as well.

515
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,160
 This is the letter that destroyed my universe quite literally

516
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,440
 and in many, many ways.

517
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,400
 I love that.

518
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,160
 It's really cool.

519
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,120
 This debate they had is known as the Great Debate

520
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,080
 between Shapley and Curtis.

521
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:23,120
 And basically, Curtis thought that there was extra galaxies.

522
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,320
 And Shapley thought that there was only one galaxy

523
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,600
 but that we weren't in the middle of it.

524
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,120
 We were kind of on the side of it.

525
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,680
 And Curtis thought that we were in the middle of our galaxy

526
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,840
 and it turned out they were both wrong

527
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,000
 or both right at the same time, which again is quite good about science.

528
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,200
 It's like you might be right, you might be wrong or more likely.

529
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,120
 You might be kind of right in some ways and wrong in some ways.

530
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,240
 Yeah, because we're not in the middle of our galaxy.

531
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,840
 We're on an arm, right?

532
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,080
 We're on an outer tentacle.

533
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,080
 Exactly.

534
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,600
 The giant great octopus.

535
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,840
 Thank you.

536
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:58,000
 The center of our galaxy is within the Sagittarius constellation

537
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 and actually it's the part of the Sagittarius constellation.

538
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,840
 I think it's the five brightest stars

539
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,760
 that make up the shape of a teapot.

540
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,480
 So actually, the center of our galaxy, the Milky Way,

541
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,120
 is sort of just above the spout of a teapot.

542
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,520
 I know, it looks like a teapot.

543
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,240
 Shine British flag at the same time.

544
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,320
 Yeah, it's a very British flag.

545
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,560
 Yeah.

546
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:20,760
 So it was Edwin Hubble that basically proved Shapley that he was wrong.

547
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,560
 But this isn't the first time that Edwin Hubble has proved somebody wrong.

548
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,560
 Oh, really?

549
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,560
 In fact, he also proved Einstein wrong.

550
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,800
 At one point as well.

551
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,480
 Back then, Albert Einstein was looking at his calculations of space

552
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,400
 and going, this doesn't really quite make sense

553
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,280
 because if gravity is such a big, important thing,

554
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,080
 then surely everything should be coming towards each other.

555
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,040
 Surely the galaxy should be shrinking.

556
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,320
 So to make sense of the math,

557
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,160
 he introduced this thing called a constant,

558
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,720
 a cosmological constant, which is just from now on.

559
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,080
 Space is static.

560
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,600
 I say it's still because that's what makes sense.

561
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,600
 Wow.

562
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,720
 And then Hubble came along and was like,

563
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,360
 oh, really sorry, but actually look at this, here's my proof.

564
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,960
 We now know about looking at the way light moves

565
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,960
 and looking at redshift.

566
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,560
 I can tell you that the universe is in fact expanding.

567
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,240
 So I'm sorry, you're wrong.

568
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,320
 And Einstein said, yeah, that was probably my greatest blunder.

569
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,040
 Why knock some down, doesn't he?

570
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,360
 Yeah.

571
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,520
 Hubble didn't have a funeral.

572
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,160
 His wife wouldn't tell anyone what had happened to him.

573
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,440
 I just find this mysterious.

574
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,520
 Oh, we know how he died, right?

575
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,040
 Like it was in a mysterious death.

576
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,800
 I don't know. But I know that he died.

577
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,960
 I think, yeah, I think probably he died normally.

578
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,480
 And then she just didn't tell us the location.

579
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,960
 What Einstein is, we're not saying

580
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,000
 there's anything nefarious going on with his wife.

581
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,160
 Yeah, I'm not saying there isn't, though.

582
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,160
 Are you?

583
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,920
 Well, I'm just not saying, I mean, it's a cold case.

584
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,000
 I'm saying, we don't know.

585
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,840
 And that's actually the scientific method

586
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,920
 to just saying, don't know, and then hope someone else does the work.

587
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,720
 No, he didn't have a funeral.

588
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,720
 And his wife refused to say either where he was buried

589
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,560
 or whether his ashes had been scattered or where

590
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,360
 or anything like that.

591
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:56,080
 And he was making lots of enemies of scientists

592
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,400
 by proving them wrong every day.

593
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,400
 Exactly.

594
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,200
 Exactly.

595
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,840
 There's no way to visit, but I guess he does have a fairly big telescope.

596
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,440
 Well, you know, it's just like the observatory up there now

597
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,320
 that we can all remember him by his face.

598
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,400
 Yes, you're right.

599
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,120
 He didn't start out as a scientist.

600
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,840
 He started out thanks to family pressure studying law.

601
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,360
 Oh, yeah.

602
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:16,240
 Because his family taught him like there's no future in this science thing.

603
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,200
 And then he spent a year teaching high school physics, which I love.

604
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,000
 Imagine if Mr. Hubble was your...

605
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 Yes, he did.

606
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 Just pretty cool.

607
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 And basketball as well.

608
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,800
 And he was very nifty on the basketball court.

609
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,800
 And not just Nifty.

610
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,200
 He was a major basketball player for his college.

611
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,000
 And a lot of people said he could have become a professional

612
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,320
 in a couple of different sports.

613
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,840
 So he had that little decision to make.

614
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,840
 Well, those guys.

615
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,840
 Good evening.

616
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,840
 Good evening.

617
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,840
 Yeah.

618
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,840
 Shapley also had an interesting beginning

619
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,200
 because he was an incredibly clever kid.

620
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,720
 He advanced in his school years, you know, those kids

621
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,320
 that you hear that graduate, you know, their high school

622
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,680
 when they're like nine.

623
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,040
 He was that kind of kid.

624
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,720
 And he didn't know what he wanted to study.

625
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,400
 And he decided I'm going to just study and do in life what I see first

626
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,840
 on the list, the alphabetical list of subjects for college.

627
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,640
 He said he kept an acrobat.

628
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,240
 Yeah, but only because advox studies were full.

629
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,240
 Yeah.

630
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,600
 Yeah, he said he rejected archaeology because he couldn't pronounce it properly.

631
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,040
 So he picked astronomy.

632
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:21,200
 It's probably a nice mythology he's created for himself, but that's his claim.

633
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:26,480
 In the 40s, he rescued lots of his colleagues from the Nazis.

634
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,800
 So lots of scientists in Germany, especially Jewish ones, were being victimized.

635
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:36,200
 And he got them out of there and brought them over to America and sort of signed, said,

636
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,200
 oh, they're going to be really important for our university.

637
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,520
 So I'm going to get them out here.

638
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,520
 And they reckon he saved up at least a thousand families from the Nazis.

639
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,520
 Wow.

640
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,520
 That was Shapley.

641
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,520
 That was Shapley.

642
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:52,480
 So the stars will not be of much good to us if we do not preserve the minds with which to

643
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,640
 comprehend them.

644
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,160
 And then after that, he was accused of being a communist.

645
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:04,680
 And that's because in those days, you could be accused of being a premature anti-fascist.

646
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:10,440
 If you, if you, like, you were lads and not like you, this never happens.

647
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:17,160
 So, like, the idea is like you, if you didn't like the fascists in 1945, that was fine.

648
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:21,120
 But if you didn't like them in the 30s, that was dodgy in America.

649
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,000
 Because they were still, the idea was that Hitler was the one who saved Germany from communism.

650
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,680
 Generally speaking, in America, people were not massively anti the Nazis until the war.

651
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,680
 Yeah.

652
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:34,320
 And so if you could be seen to be anti them before the war, people thought you were a communist.

653
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,320
 Oh, gosh.

654
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,320
 Isn't that amazing?

655
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,040
 So you had a narrow window to say, you know what?

656
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,760
 I'm not sure about these guys.

657
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,760
 I hear about these.

658
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:49,920
 Well, yeah, he appeared before the Un-American Activities Committee, the McCarthy Committee.

659
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,920
 Oh, sure.

660
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,920
 But yeah.

661
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,200
 Yeah, really interesting guy.

662
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,200
 Yeah.

663
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,600
 That's fascinating.

664
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:02,640
 So the, the star that was spotted by Hubble is arguably the second most important star

665
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,640
 in the universe.

666
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,440
 So is this the one that proved that we are?

667
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,440
 Yeah, right.

668
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,080
 Yeah, it's called V1.

669
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,840
 And it's located in the Andromeda Nebula.

670
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,240
 It's 2.2 million light years away.

671
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:18,200
 And it has 1/100th of the brightness of the faintest star that is visible to our naked eye.

672
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,200
 Right.

673
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,800
 And I've read that it's often used as a marker for when you're judging other galaxies now.

674
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,720
 Because you need a marker point to go where it's further and where it's not.

675
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,720
 Yeah.

676
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,080
 So because it's a little bit dimmer, they can go that is definitely really far away.

677
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,080
 Yeah.

678
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,960
 Way, way further away than anything that could be within our galaxy.

679
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,960
 Exactly.

680
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,960
 Yeah.

681
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,960
 Yeah.

682
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,960
 Yeah.

683
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,960
 It's pretty amazing.

684
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,640
 The naked eye, if you really, really, really look, it just looks like a smudge if it's really

685
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,640
 dark.

686
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,640
 Right.

687
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,480
 They thought it was a star for a long time, and then it was only of course when they got these

688
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,320
 really good telescopes, you could tell that it was a group of stars.

689
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,240
 That's quite a close galaxy, I presume.

690
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,240
 Closest, I think.

691
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,240
 Is it?

692
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,240
 Maybe.

693
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,240
 It's one of our closest.

694
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,080
 I think one day the Andromeda is going to crash into ours.

695
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,080
 All right.

696
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,240
 You don't need to worry about it because it'll be like in millions and millions and millions

697
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,240
 of years.

698
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,240
 Yeah.

699
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,640
 But I've also read that if two galaxies are going to crash into each other, the size of

700
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,760
 galaxies would mean that you would just pass through each other and not notice.

701
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,760
 What?

702
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,760
 Oh, that's cool.

703
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,760
 Yeah.

704
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,520
 The space in between each place in a galaxy is so great.

705
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,520
 Yeah.

706
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,520
 It's so easy to be some collisions.

707
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,520
 We've all just...

708
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,960
 What's playing in the alley, I think, is that the gravity would pull them kind of together

709
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,480
 and they would join the mass of the stars.

710
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,480
 Right.

711
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,680
 There'll be some dents in the fender, I'm sure, at the end of the process.

712
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,680
 Yes.

713
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:36,760
 50 billion of the stars in our galaxy now, they arrived here eight billion years ago

714
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:41,000
 when our galaxy collided with another galaxy called the sausage galaxy.

715
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 Amazing.

716
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 Amazing.

717
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 I don't even know where to believe you.

718
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 It's true.

719
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 It's true.

720
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 It's sometimes...

721
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,640
 It's sometimes called the Gaia Enceladus Galaxy.

722
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,640
 Definitely.

723
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:00,120
 And some places called the sausage galaxy and it collided with ours and we've got a lot

724
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,120
 of stars from around here.

725
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,120
 The sausage and teapot.

726
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,120
 It's basically what we're talking about.

727
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,120
 It's an English breakfast.

728
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:09,760
 It's just one giant full English that we're living in.

729
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,800
 But on the sausage front, I do think some astronauts have reported just generally space

730
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:18,800
 to smell a little bit like barbeque and barbeque, yeah, because when they've come back in

731
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:24,080
 after a spacewalk, they've noticed the scent of barbeque on their spacesuits.

732
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,080
 Wow.

733
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,320
 But also in terms of what does space smell like.

734
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,120
 If we actually look at the Milky Way, so our galaxy, there is an area within the Milky

735
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,880
 Way, got this giant cloud of gas and dust, you've got this a star forming region.

736
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,840
 And they discover that it was packed full of this chemical known as Ethyl Formates, which

737
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,720
 is responsible for giving both raspberries and rum, their flavour.

738
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,720
 Oh.

739
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,880
 So not only do we have the teapot and sausages, we also have rum and raspberries as well.

740
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,880
 Oh, and milk.

741
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,880
 Milk for the tea.

742
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,880
 The Milky Way.

743
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,880
 Of course.

744
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,880
 Yeah.

745
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,880
 How exciting.

746
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:04,200
 See, we should acknowledge as well a quick shout out to Henrietta Swan Levit, who was known

747
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,800
 as a human computer, and at one point also worked at Harvard University's observatory many,

748
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,840
 many years before Shapley got there.

749
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:17,560
 She's the person who worked out a thing about the rate of pulses coming out of the star,

750
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,880
 which was then used by Hubble.

751
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,880
 Now I see.

752
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,600
 So she kind of like came up with a standard of this is how you can work out how far away

753
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,680
 the star is by measuring the luminosity of its pulses.

754
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:35,200
 Now you measure luminosity and crabs, I think, which is the crab nebula has a certain

755
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,200
 luminosity.

756
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,080
 It's a certain luminosity.

757
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,160
 And it's like, is it brighter or less bright than the crab nebula?

758
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:45,160
 So something seven crabs, it's seven times brighter than the crab nebula.

759
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:50,240
 Is this just a big, like, bar and grill restaurant out of space?

760
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,240
 Yeah.

761
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,240
 I don't mind it.

762
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,240
 We should start a themed restaurant.

763
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,320
 The menu is looking really, really good.

764
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:01,480
 I guess, I don't know, but with these, the pulsars, with these stars and a pulsing, the

765
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,840
 sephid stars that we're able to measure distance with, I'm assuming that they're very,

766
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:09,480
 very unlikely to have life around them, because the light they're emitting is so, so unreliable.

767
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,400
 I've got a room at the moment with a bulb, which is dodgy, and you can't be in that room.

768
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:18,400
 It's on one of the old dimmer switches, and we put a new dimmer bulb in, and it's just

769
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,880
 an absolute nightmare to be in.

770
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,880
 I hate that.

771
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,880
 Yeah.

772
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,880
 That makes sense to me.

773
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,880
 That's crazy.

774
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,880
 But it's not really hot.

775
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,680
 Thank you, Professor.

776
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:32,880
 Why really like about this thing about chaply and Hubble is they suddenly increased the size

777
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,880
 of the universe?

778
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,880
 Yes.

779
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,880
 Right?

780
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:41,040
 So we start with Tollamy all the way back in ancient times, and he thought that the entire

781
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,800
 universe was 20,000 times the Earth's radius.

782
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,800
 20,000?

783
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,800
 Okay.

784
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,640
 And he worked out out by saying, okay, well, the Earth is here in the middle.

785
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,480
 Everything goes round us, and then there's Mercury and Venus and the Sun and Mars and Jupiter,

786
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,160
 and then there's something else and something else, and eventually you get to the stars.

787
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:02,080
 And he had this nice little sort of nesting tables where everything goes, and he worked

788
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,080
 that out.

789
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:07,040
 And then Newton comes along and says, okay, well, the stars don't seem to move much according

790
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:15,600
 to each other, so they don't have parallax, which is parallax is like if you put your thumb

791
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,920
 in front of your face and then close one eye and close the other, it seems to move, but

792
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,560
 if you do it with something far away, it moves much less.

793
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,760
 So he worked out with the stars, they're not doing that, so they must be really far away.

794
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,600
 So that got the universe much, much bigger.

795
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:34,160
 And then the guy called Friedrich Bessel, he managed to work out the parallax, so there

796
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:40,160
 is slight parallax and worked out that the, now the universe is light years in size.

797
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,760
 And then we got this great debate.

798
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,880
 We worked out that there's more than one galaxy, and then they found background radiation,

799
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,640
 which meant that suddenly the universe is, we don't know how big it is, but the observable

800
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:55,560
 universe is as far as light could get to us from when the universe started.

801
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,560
 Yes.

802
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,560
 And I've heard that.

803
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,360
 I just love how it kind of inspires.

804
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,360
 It's really cool.

805
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,360
 Yeah.

806
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,360
 How much further should we go?

807
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,360
 I'm sure it wouldn't be at some stage.

808
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,360
 It'll get bigger still.

809
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,360
 We just don't know how.

810
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,360
 We don't know how.

811
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,360
 Yeah.

812
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,360
 So cool.

813
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,360
 Well, this is I think, you know, the new James Webb Space Telescope.

814
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,360
 Yeah.

815
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,360
 Very, very big telescope.

816
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,400
 I've pushed into orbit for, for better views and things like that.

817
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:20,200
 And it has found six enormous ancient galaxies, which would be nicknamed the universe breakers.

818
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,200
 And I love this.

819
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,720
 And they shouldn't exist, right?

820
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,720
 Wow.

821
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,720
 Wow.

822
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,520
 There should only be, from the point of where they are, you know, we know how long the light

823
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,520
 has taken to travel to us.

824
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,040
 We know the rough age they are.

825
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:35,520
 They should not have had time to form, because they date to 500 million years after the

826
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,520
 big bang.

827
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,640
 There should only be tiny baby galaxies there, but they're very well developed.

828
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:44,560
 And please tell me they look like a Hushbrown.

829
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:52,400
 We need it on the menu.

830
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,400
 Okay.

831
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,440
 There's time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

832
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:03,720
 My fact is, the first ever geothermal power station powered five light bulbs or some

833
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,040
 sources say full, but I prefer that I'm backing it.

834
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,560
 I think it's the source I found.

835
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,560
 Yeah.

836
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:14,440
 And fifth one, it was liable, but it kept going on and off, and it was really a way.

837
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,640
 I just have to tell it off after working the dark.

838
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:23,880
 This was in 1904, and we're in Tuscany, or lovely, lovely, but with an anti-painter picture.

839
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,880
 Absolutely.

840
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,760
 Well, just hear those Tuscany, local animals and flora and fauna.

841
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,760
 Glass of Montipolciano.

842
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,760
 Beautiful.

843
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,040
 Overlooking the Tower of Pisa.

844
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,040
 Probably.

845
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:41,440
 The Taurus kind of pretending to hold it up.

846
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,160
 And this is in an area called the Devil's Valley.

847
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:48,640
 Oh, it's not the Tower of Pisa.

848
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,600
 But I suppose it's appropriate that it was the Devil's Valley because we're going underground

849
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,560
 into the warm.

850
00:30:54,560 --> 00:31:01,960
 And this was where a guy called Prince Piano or Ginori Conti lit up the first ever geothermal

851
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,960
 power station.

852
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,960
 So that is taking.

853
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,800
 We need from underground, bringing it above ground.

854
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,400
 And there are various different ways you can harness the power.

855
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:15,520
 One of them is by directly using steam from underground to turn a turbine, which then spins

856
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,400
 up and generates electricity.

857
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,200
 There are lots of different methods of doing it, which I'm sure we'll get into.

858
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,840
 But this first little experiment did four or five light bulbs.

859
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,840
 That's so tiny.

860
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,840
 That's so cool.

861
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,480
 But it's the cradle of geothermal, which is now being talked of as a big solution to

862
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:33,840
 lots of power shortages and a much, much cleaner way of powering the world than fossil.

863
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,760
 So there's a lot of renewed excitement about it.

864
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,760
 And it's still going, isn't it?

865
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,920
 Over a hundred years later, that exact spot they have a huge factory that is producing

866
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,920
 geothermal.

867
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,920
 Yeah.

868
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:47,440
 That Devil's Valley was the landscape that inspired Dante to make hell in divine comedy.

869
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,680
 So when he writes about hell, he's talking about that place.

870
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,680
 Oh my goodness.

871
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,680
 That's cool.

872
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,680
 That's so cool.

873
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,320
 So not the picture I've seen painting for his at all.

874
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,320
 That's wrong.

875
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,320
 It'd be opposite.

876
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,320
 Yeah, really amazing.

877
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,320
 This guy was here, Prince.

878
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,080
 So I read he was Prince of Trevich Nano.

879
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,080
 I think he was.

880
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,280
 I couldn't get to the bottom of that either.

881
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,760
 It's sort of in some places it didn't mention it and then other places suddenly Prince was attached

882
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,760
 to his name.

883
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,760
 I think he was.

884
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,240
 I think he was narrows the correct.

885
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,240
 He was.

886
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,240
 I'm afraid.

887
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:20,600
 Second mention for the fascist in the show, he was made for the Mussolini before or after

888
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,800
 it all went wrong.

889
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,800
 He was friends when it was fashionable in Italy to be friends with Mussolini.

890
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,800
 I don't know what happened after the war.

891
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,800
 Okay.

892
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,800
 Yeah.

893
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,800
 Well, I know what happened to Mussolini.

894
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,800
 Oh, I know.

895
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,600
 But he was processing Boracacid.

896
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,600
 Yes.

897
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,600
 Where is that?

898
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,600
 Boracacid.

899
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,600
 Boracacid.

900
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,600
 From this particular area.

901
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,600
 Yeah, exactly.

902
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:45,540
 And then he realised that he could make electricity from it and then started this geothermal

903
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,540
 company afterwards.

904
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,540
 Didn't he?

905
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,540
 Right.

906
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:52,040
 I'm surprised it's first happened in Tuscany actually because when I think of areas of geothermal

907
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:57,320
 activity, I immediately think of Iceland and that's kind of where I immediately go.

908
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:03,220
 I think Italy's a relatively big user of geothermal, despite it's a tiny, tiny percentage

909
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,220
 of its power.

910
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,600
 They do have a few volcanoes there, don't they?

911
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,600
 Oh, yeah.

912
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,600
 That's what I suppose.

913
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,600
 Yeah.

914
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,600
 And basically, that's the thing.

915
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:16,160
 Traditional geothermal relies on very specific conditions, which is it's tectonic things, lots

916
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,760
 of heat close to the surface so you don't need to drill down for miles and miles.

917
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,240
 So Iceland is brilliant because it's got exactly that.

918
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,640
 Kenya is very good for it.

919
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:30,680
 Iceland has installed underfloor heating outdoors, nice outdoors, like, under the roads and

920
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,680
 tables.

921
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,680
 Yeah.

922
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,360
 It's got so much warm water just you just place the surface.

923
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,360
 They just have, they're stunning.

924
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,360
 That's very clever.

925
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,360
 Yeah.

926
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,360
 It's very clever.

927
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:45,720
 They also have the, they grow more bananas in glass houses in Iceland than they do anywhere

928
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,720
 else, which I think.

929
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,720
 Really?

930
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,720
 Yeah.

931
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,720
 I know they don't.

932
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:53,200
 So they aren't growing bananas commercially to sell because they don't actually have enough

933
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:59,000
 light to sort of the turnover of bananas to be good enough, but they do have a lot of geothermally

934
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 heated greenhouses.

935
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 Right.

936
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,520
 So I think they can get enough heat going.

937
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:08,040
 I think the greenhouses have to be around 20 degrees permanently to get the bananas to grow,

938
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:12,040
 but then to also be using the geothermal energy to provide enough light that the bananas

939
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,040
 would also need.

940
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,040
 Yeah.

941
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,040
 It's just not commercially viable.

942
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,760
 So they're like dark bananas that you can harvest?

943
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,760
 Dark.

944
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,760
 In the eight-month night.

945
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:26,360
 They'll put a bit of light on, but I just don't think it's enough because they need so much

946
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,360
 light.

947
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,360
 Okay.

948
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:32,720
 But also tomatoes, various tropical fruits, algae, they've grown a lot of algae now using geothermal

949
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,720
 energy in Iceland.

950
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,720
 Lovely.

951
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:37,520
 Just scrape it off to get your spoon relieved of the superfood.

952
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,520
 Yeah.

953
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:41,480
 In case you haven't picked it up really, I've got a reputation as the guy on the show who likes

954
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,480
 the boring stuff.

955
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,480
 Oh.

956
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:48,240
 It's just slightly unfair because we all like the barring stuff.

957
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,240
 Yeah.

958
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,720
 They really get excited, don't they?

959
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,320
 Underfloor heating, invented by the Romans.

960
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:00,320
 They had like your house or your villa would be maybe a few metres above the ground or a

961
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:05,800
 metre above the ground, and then people would set fires or boil water underneath and that

962
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,480
 would get you on.

963
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:13,560
 But they put geothermal underfloor heating in Bath in the city of Bath in the UK, because

964
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,160
 down there there's quite a lot of hot springs and stuff.

965
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,480
 They could actually have, there's a few villas in Bath where you would get their geothermal

966
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,480
 stuff.

967
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,480
 It's amazing.

968
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,720
 Isn't it incredible that ancient Rome 2,000 years ago has underfloor heating and yet I

969
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,720
 don't.

970
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,720
 You don't know what I mean.

971
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,720
 You can do it.

972
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,720
 You can do it.

973
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,440
 It's such a pain of the bum to put in, you know?

974
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,440
 Yeah.

975
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,440
 Yes.

976
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,200
 Like why didn't they put it into my home whenever they were building it?

977
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,200
 Yes.

978
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,200
 What's going on?

979
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,200
 Why is that?

980
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,880
 I think in the UK we don't necessarily need it that much, because we don't really get

981
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,360
 very hot, very cold days.

982
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:52,000
 I had it in my home in South East London when I lived there in our bathroom, but as the

983
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,480
 builder was putting the final tile down he accidentally shredded one of the wires and

984
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,400
 there was too expensive to do anything about it.

985
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,400
 What do you mean?

986
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,400
 We have read it.

987
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,920
 He just said one of the shredded wheat machines.

988
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,920
 That's amazing.

989
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:07,520
 Basically he said that he did something to one of the wires and so it never worked.

990
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,520
 Oh yeah.

991
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,520
 But it was there.

992
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,520
 So it's all there.

993
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,520
 It's all there.

994
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,520
 Just it never worked.

995
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,520
 So we technically had it.

996
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,520
 And we would always think about it.

997
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:20,480
 It's been a big consolation as you walked in onto the freezing cold floor in the winter morning.

998
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,480
 We would tell people who visited.

999
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,800
 Then we got under a floor heating.

1000
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,800
 It doesn't work.

1001
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,800
 But we have it.

1002
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,800
 Yeah.

1003
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,800
 Did he still pay him?

1004
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,800
 Yeah.

1005
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,800
 Yeah.

1006
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,800
 I mean, he was.

1007
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,800
 He's still working.

1008
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,800
 It doesn't work.

1009
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,800
 It's a scary trait.

1010
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,800
 It's fault wires break.

1011
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,800
 Wow.

1012
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,800
 Wow.

1013
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,800
 It doesn't make me think though.

1014
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,920
 You know, like if someone in the past had made a slightly different decision, it would

1015
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,880
 we be using geothermal energy more across the world because obviously there are some places

1016
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,880
 where it makes sense to use it because it's easier to access.

1017
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:54,320
 But I guess if you drill down deep enough, eventually you are going to tap into geothermal

1018
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,320
 energy.

1019
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:58,760
 So why is it we're not using it more because it does make an awful lot of sense?

1020
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,760
 It's just a pain to get down.

1021
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,760
 It's just a pain to drill.

1022
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,760
 It's an initial pain.

1023
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,760
 That's the process.

1024
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,760
 It's very expensive to set up.

1025
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,760
 Exactly.

1026
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,600
 And if you do it the old way where you're looking for quite a hot magma field.

1027
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,600
 Yeah.

1028
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,520
 If you go deep enough anywhere, you're going to get hot.

1029
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,760
 But what they want to do is find somewhere that's not that deep and dig down.

1030
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,480
 Those places are really hard to find.

1031
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:23,040
 It's not like, you know, it's obvious because these trees grow there, so it's going to be

1032
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,040
 there.

1033
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:27,800
 But you basically have to keep digging until you find the right place.

1034
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,800
 Right.

1035
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:34,720
 And there's recently, they've used AI in Nevada to find these zones where you can dig

1036
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,720
 into.

1037
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,760
 And they don't really know how the AI's found it.

1038
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,320
 They're basically putting all the information of all the different zones around the world

1039
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:45,520
 where you can get this easy geothermal energy.

1040
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,400
 And the AI models have just found the signal out of the noise.

1041
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,360
 It's just like they've worked out where it is even though they're not quite sure how they

1042
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,360
 did it.

1043
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,360
 But it does work.

1044
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,360
 Wow.

1045
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,360
 It's one good use of it.

1046
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,360
 Yeah.

1047
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:03,600
 And now they've got enough energy from the geothermal to pay for one AI question.

1048
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:09,560
 As we said, it's tricky to do everywhere because digging down is expensive and it's more economical

1049
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:13,480
 if there's lots of heat closer to the surface, which is only true in a few places.

1050
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,360
 So there are lots of things being tried to get around this now.

1051
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:20,480
 One of them is just most heat you need unless it's like industrial heat for a factory is

1052
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,480
 actually pretty low.

1053
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:26,000
 And so that's these boreholes, the ground source heat pump thing, like China's going gangbusters

1054
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 on that.

1055
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,880
 And there are other kind of wacky versions of geothermal.

1056
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:35,440
 There's enhanced, there's advanced, and there's super critical hot rock.

1057
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,440
 Okay.

1058
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,440
 I'm going to choose the last one.

1059
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,440
 That's a cool kind of rock music.

1060
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,440
 Yeah.

1061
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,440
 That should be a genre.

1062
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,840
 Yeah, I should know.

1063
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:46,800
 So here's an idea that's being experimented with.

1064
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,760
 You drill a couple of holes, you drill down a mile or two, right?

1065
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,560
 Two separate shafts.

1066
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,440
 You then drill sideways between the shafts, okay?

1067
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,440
 So you've joined them up.

1068
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,240
 You've made a sort of like a U shape.

1069
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,240
 Like a U shape.

1070
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,240
 Exactly.

1071
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:08,840
 Then you pump water down hole one, and you pumping it towards hole number two, and you're sort

1072
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,000
 of cracking the rocks along the way.

1073
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,640
 And the water is taking all the heat out of these rather hot rocks, and then the water is

1074
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:19,480
 pumped out of a second well, and it's at 200 degrees Celsius.

1075
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:23,720
 How can it be at 200 degrees water, boils at 100 degrees?

1076
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,680
 Ah, must be high pressure.

1077
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,080
 It's high pressure.

1078
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,800
 It's really high pressure.

1079
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:35,080
 So you get this thing, you get super heated, sort of super critical steam, which can drive

1080
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:39,560
 a turbine extremely well, or you just use that heat to actually heat up other water,

1081
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,560
 which then drives a turbine.

1082
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,680
 Like there are different methods of doing it.

1083
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,680
 It's very, very cool.

1084
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,080
 It's actually quite similar to fracking, isn't it?

1085
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,080
 It's basically fracking.

1086
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,080
 It's basically fracking.

1087
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:52,280
 So they use the technology that fracking did to get oil out, but instead of doing that,

1088
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,280
 they put water in and heated it up.

1089
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,280
 Exactly.

1090
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,280
 Exactly.

1091
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,920
 Well, that happy about it, because fracking can cause earthquakes.

1092
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,920
 Yes.

1093
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,920
 Right.

1094
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,920
 So yeah.

1095
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,920
 But is it a better way to use fracking technology potentially?

1096
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,920
 Well, undoubtedly.

1097
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,920
 Yeah.

1098
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,160
 Because you're getting, it's much greener.

1099
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:12,600
 Another way you can do it is instead of using water, you might be able to use hydrogen.

1100
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:16,760
 This is something called the Johnson Thermoelectric Energy Converter.

1101
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:20,640
 And the best thing about it is it's solid state, so you put it into the water, and it's just

1102
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:25,440
 one object, you put it in, and then it gets electricity out of it.

1103
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:30,520
 And it was invented by a guy called Lonnie Johnson, who also invented the super-soaker.

1104
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,520
 Isn't that amazing?

1105
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:36,520
 I thought I recognized that name for someone.

1106
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,520
 Yeah.

1107
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,520
 Wow.

1108
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:43,720
 It's very, very, at the moment, they're not using it, but it might be used in the future.

1109
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:50,160
 And this guy is, wants to use it in L.A., where they have a lot of, like, old oil wells,

1110
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,360
 so they've already got the holes down there, so you can just put stuff down there.

1111
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:57,680
 The moment the temperature in those oil wells is too low, and you can't really get much

1112
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,280
 geothermal out, but because this is so efficient, you might be able to use it.

1113
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,280
 That's interesting.

1114
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:05,760
 By anyway, he invented the super-soaker, so I mean, yeah.

1115
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,800
 The difference in those two inventions is, like, the equivalent of Einstein doing E equals

1116
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,800
 M to E square.

1117
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,280
 It's, like, what are you going to do for his next equation?

1118
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,280
 Viva 6 afraid of 7.

1119
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,280
 789?

1120
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:19,320
 Like, that's that similarity.

1121
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:28,800
 Okay, it's time for our final fact to the show, and that is James.

1122
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,800
 Okay.

1123
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:37,840
 My fact this week is that in Peru, you can be sued by a B.

1124
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:45,960
 And he's got 20 million witnesses.

1125
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:49,680
 I don't really know. It has to be a stingless B.

1126
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:56,760
 It has to be in one of two parts of Peru, the town of Sapito, or the Loretto department,

1127
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,080
 but they're both in the Amazon.

1128
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:05,040
 And it turns out that these areas have stingless bees that are very, very important to indigenous

1129
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:11,600
 communities, and they've been hurt by pollution, climate change, habitat loss, all that kind

1130
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,600
 of stuff.

1131
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:16,400
 So, these two areas of Peru have given them rights.

1132
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:22,200
 And while the B cup fill out the paperwork, a human can act on their behalf.

1133
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:26,680
 And so, if, like, let's say, a tree-felling company comes into the Amazon, cuts down a load

1134
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:35,160
 of habitat of these bees, then a environmental company can go over and sue them on behalf

1135
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,160
 of the bees.

1136
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,080
 Can I sue a B?

1137
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,880
 Yeah, if they have rights.

1138
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:42,880
 And just those two places.

1139
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,880
 They're stingless.

1140
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:46,240
 So, I think the best they could do is give you a little nibble.

1141
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,240
 They can bite.

1142
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,240
 Those bees can bite.

1143
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,520
 Why are you going to sue them?

1144
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:53,480
 I'm just trying to work out what this new right has given them as a flip-byde coin.

1145
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,480
 It's fine.

1146
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,480
 It's fine.

1147
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,480
 It's fine.

1148
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,480
 It's fine.

1149
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,480
 Yeah.

1150
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,480
 Sorry.

1151
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,480
 It's a cup breakdown.

1152
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,480
 But classic.

1153
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,480
 A hive chaser.

1154
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,480
 But also, can you sue a single B? Or does it have to be the colony?

1155
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,480
 Oh.

1156
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:12,080
 See, I wonder if you can take up a personal agreement with A-B.

1157
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,080
 A-B.

1158
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:16,080
 Rowan Atkinson has just made a very successful series about this, isn't it?

1159
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,080
 Oh, yeah.

1160
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,080
 Man vs B.

1161
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:22,240
 They don't cover series two of Man vs B, which is just the legal battle after this.

1162
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,240
 Set in the Amazon.

1163
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,240
 Yeah.

1164
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,240
 They did some cool these bees.

1165
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,240
 They're amazing.

1166
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,880
 There's one big lie about stingless bees.

1167
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:30,880
 Yeah.

1168
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:31,880
 They do have stings.

1169
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,880
 What?

1170
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:33,880
 Yes, they do.

1171
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:34,880
 I didn't know this.

1172
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,880
 I mean, I didn't know the stingless bee was a thing until this week.

1173
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,480
 That's a roller coaster that you've been on.

1174
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,480
 Oh, my God.

1175
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,480
 There's a thing called a stingless bee.

1176
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,480
 Oh, my God.

1177
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,480
 They have stings.

1178
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,480
 I know.

1179
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,480
 I did.

1180
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,480
 I thought are the harmless.

1181
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,480
 But they're not.

1182
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:50,320
 So the stings are called degenerate stings, because they're so small and ineffective that

1183
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,320
 they don't count.

1184
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,320
 No.

1185
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,320
 I know.

1186
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:56,800
 But they do, as you said, Dan, they bite like the devil.

1187
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,680
 They'll do suicidal biting, which is a biological term, which is where they bite and bite

1188
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,680
 and bite and bite.

1189
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:03,680
 Yeah.

1190
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,680
 You.

1191
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:05,680
 Just you.

1192
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:06,680
 Yeah.

1193
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:14,440
 Going after the bees, they're coming view Dan.

1194
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:18,440
 And basically, they will keep biting and if you try and pull them away, yeah.

1195
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:21,480
 They will suffer fatal damage to their body rather than stop biting.

1196
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,480
 Okay.

1197
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,480
 They head off.

1198
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,480
 Yeah, exactly.

1199
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,480
 Yeah.

1200
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:30,680
 So they will just clamp down their jaws with so much vigor that they just will not let

1201
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,680
 go.

1202
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,080
 Like a dangerous dog.

1203
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,080
 Like a dangerous dog.

1204
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:37,640
 You know, they always say that the dogs will clamp onto you and they won't like go unless

1205
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,240
 you put your finger up the body.

1206
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,240
 That is true.

1207
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,280
 And I don't suppose you could do that with a bee.

1208
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,280
 No.

1209
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:48,280
 And there's a useless thing in the way.

1210
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,760
 But those are suicidal tendencies.

1211
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,720
 We see that in bees' withstings as well.

1212
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:53,720
 Oh, really?

1213
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:59,200
 So the bees that we have in here in Europe, in UK, aethysmelaferra, they will sting you.

1214
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:03,080
 But sadly, when they sting you, the sting will, the barbs will get stuck in your skin

1215
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,080
 and this essentially rips out their abdomen.

1216
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,080
 Right.

1217
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:09,120
 So I guess we're seeing the same behavior in the stingless bee.

1218
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:13,800
 It's just that they are physically choosing to not let go when they could.

1219
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:18,320
 So that instinct to protect is so intense that, yeah, you're a beekeeper, aren't you?

1220
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,320
 Yeah.

1221
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,320
 How many?

1222
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,320
 How many have you got?

1223
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,320
 70,000.

1224
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,320
 What?

1225
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,320
 It's all there.

1226
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,320
 And their names are.

1227
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,320
 70,000.

1228
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,320
 Yeah, I'd say.

1229
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,320
 I'd say that.

1230
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,320
 Yeah.

1231
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,320
 How many hives is that?

1232
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:35,120
 That's at the moment because it's January, so the hives, they significantly decrease in numbers

1233
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,120
 over the winter.

1234
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:39,280
 But yeah, I would say in the height of the summer, around 70,000.

1235
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,280
 So cool.

1236
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,280
 And gals.

1237
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,120
 Have you been stung?

1238
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,120
 Many times.

1239
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,120
 I've seen you.

1240
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,120
 Many times.

1241
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,120
 Yeah.

1242
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,120
 So certainly do have stings.

1243
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,120
 Where's the most painful spot?

1244
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,120
 Oh, painful.

1245
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:53,120
 The most annoying was on my forehead.

1246
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,160
 I sort of looked like a Star Trek character.

1247
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:57,560
 I remember that for quite some time.

1248
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:58,880
 That took a long time to go down.

1249
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:02,680
 I do have to be careful, though, because every time I get stung, I think I'm reacting a little

1250
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:05,400
 bit more every single time, so I do need to be cautious.

1251
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,400
 Yeah.

1252
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,400
 That's very cool.

1253
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,440
 And do you use the honey for yourself?

1254
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,080
 Do you sell it in local shops and farm markets?

1255
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:13,080
 No, no.

1256
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:18,720
 I would say, I would say, only just about get enough honey to sort of maybe get me through

1257
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:19,720
 a few months.

1258
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:20,720
 Okay.

1259
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:26,080
 So me, extracting the honey is, it's something that has been developed over hundreds and

1260
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:30,760
 more than thousands of years, the bees, they will store their honey in honeycomb.

1261
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:36,200
 We encourage them to store that honey in frames that can be easily removed from the hive.

1262
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:39,800
 But stingless bees, you can also harvest their honey.

1263
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:44,320
 It's just much harder, because stingless bees don't make honeycomb.

1264
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:49,080
 Instead, they store their honey in little sort of tiny honey pots that are about the size

1265
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:54,120
 of grapes, and they're all, yeah, so they're all sort of like a little Winnie the Pooh.

1266
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,120
 Yeah.

1267
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,120
 They're all nested together.

1268
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:57,120
 What's it made of?

1269
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:58,120
 What's the pot?

1270
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:03,640
 So it's, it's similar to a sort of a sticky substance that European bees make, which is

1271
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:09,240
 called propolis, which is a combination of wax, but you also get various tree sats and

1272
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:15,240
 resins as well in the mix, so it kind of makes a bee polypillar material.

1273
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:19,480
 And, but if you want to harvest the honey, to not destroy the hive, you would have to

1274
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:24,840
 go in with a pipette or a syringe and individually sort of go into these little honey pots and take

1275
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:25,840
 them and take the honey out.

1276
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:26,840
 That's amazing.

1277
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,200
 You can't harvest it, just a lot more time can see.

1278
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,960
 And I think that people buy it and it's very, very expensive, right?

1279
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:32,960
 Yeah.

1280
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,960
 I would assume so, because it's so labelled as stingless bee honey.

1281
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:40,800
 Yeah, and it's been used like for medicine by, you know, indigenous people for hundreds

1282
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:41,800
 of years, I'm sure.

1283
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:42,800
 Yeah.

1284
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,320
 They use it for, what do they use it for?

1285
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:49,640
 They use it for, if you've got like a cough, if you've got some flam on your, on your

1286
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:53,840
 chest, they use it for that, like we would with honey, I suppose, but also for infertility

1287
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:58,680
 rheumatism, anemia and arthritis, and they make alcohol out of it.

1288
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:59,680
 Right.

1289
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:05,780
 And if you want to go and harvest it, according to locals, if on a full moon night you grab

1290
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:10,800
 a queen bee, squeeze her abdomen and smear the liquid that comes out of it, her onto your

1291
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:17,000
 eyelids, then you'll be able to temporarily see every bee's nest in the forest in the dark.

1292
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
 Right.

1293
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
 Right.

1294
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,240
 If you're ever in the Amazon, that's pretty cool.

1295
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,880
 I'm not sure it's entirely true.

1296
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,760
 I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure I love it though.

1297
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:27,760
 Sounds legit.

1298
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,680
 And your bees are all gals, do you say?

1299
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:30,680
 Yeah.

1300
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:35,680
 Well, I mean, because you've got a queen and then all the girls and they're the drones, workers,

1301
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:36,680
 workers.

1302
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:41,640
 So all the work bees are female and then she'll keep a couple of lads around, but really

1303
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:46,160
 their only purpose is to go off and mate with a queen from another hive.

1304
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,200
 So to be honest, the boys don't do anything.

1305
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,120
 They are really very useless.

1306
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,360
 Have you met the boys?

1307
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:54,960
 You can see them, they're sort of they're much larger, they're quite clumsy, they kind of

1308
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,760
 just daughter about really doing anything, getting in the way.

1309
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:03,320
 They're the bees, Maddie, the bees, you know what I'm talking about.

1310
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:04,880
 So yeah, there aren't many.

1311
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,720
 And actually the girls will kick them out, come September.

1312
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:08,720
 Yeah.

1313
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:09,720
 They get them out.

1314
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:10,720
 They're not useful anymore.

1315
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:11,720
 Where did they go?

1316
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:12,720
 They die.

1317
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:13,720
 They're on the floor.

1318
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:14,720
 Yeah.

1319
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:19,040
 So it's actually, it's the cleaner bees or the undertaker bees.

1320
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:22,360
 In fact, they get called, it's their responsibility to take out the dead.

1321
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:26,600
 So quite often, sort of as you're approaching the winter months, you'll just see just a graveyard

1322
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:29,880
 of bees in front of the hive, so they've all been taken out just to make sure things are

1323
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:30,880
 clean for the winter.

1324
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:31,880
 Yeah.

1325
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:32,880
 Wow.

1326
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,480
 I've got the case of a goat suing a pig here.

1327
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:36,480
 Oh yeah.

1328
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,480
 Okay.

1329
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:38,480
 Yep.

1330
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,480
 Gone.

1331
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,480
 2014.

1332
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,480
 The pig is pepper pig.

1333
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,480
 Oh yeah.

1334
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,480
 And the goat is Gabriela Capra.

1335
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,480
 Oh yes.

1336
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,480
 Capra.

1337
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:50,440
 Who's name in Italian means Gabriela Goat, and the character in pepper pig called Gabriela

1338
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:55,520
 Goat, and then the Italian pepper pig, she's Gabriela Capra, and she said, she needed a hundred

1339
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,840
 thousand euros to compensate her because she was annoyed.

1340
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:58,840
 And use her name.

1341
00:49:58,840 --> 00:49:59,840
 Use her name.

1342
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:00,840
 Oh right.

1343
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:02,480
 It doesn't look like she got it.

1344
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,320
 The case goes very, very quiet after a blizzard of publicity.

1345
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:06,320
 Yeah.

1346
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:12,280
 But in 2022, the owners of pepper pig themselves sued a Vietnamese firm, which had made a very,

1347
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:16,680
 very, very similar looking and feeling franchise, called Wolfu.

1348
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:20,080
 So that's three little pigs suing a wolf.

1349
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,080
 Oh.

1350
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:22,080
 That's good for it.

1351
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,080
 Yeah.

1352
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:25,080
 I was a family of four in pepper pig, but yeah, that's...

1353
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,080
 Yeah.

1354
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,080
 I don't think the younger kids.

1355
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:28,080
 Someone says, part of the morsi.

1356
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:29,080
 I was trying to...

1357
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:30,080
 Sorry.

1358
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:31,080
 The pepper is.

1359
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:33,080
 Oh my god.

1360
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,880
 You're trying to do something.

1361
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,880
 You're trying to do something.

1362
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:41,800
 I started looking at just generally the rights of other animals, and I couldn't find

1363
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:46,320
 many examples where animals had been given the equivalent to human rights.

1364
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:52,040
 There certainly are some that exist, but I was able to find quite a few examples where

1365
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:57,480
 animals are being protected from humans doing stupid things in Alaska to protect these

1366
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:59,480
 hibernating bears.

1367
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:05,600
 The US have enacted a law saying it's completely illegal to wake a bear for a photo, but it is

1368
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:06,600
 okay to hunt them.

1369
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:07,600
 Okay.

1370
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:13,600
 That feels like it's protecting the photographer.

1371
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:14,600
 Yeah.

1372
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:15,600
 Yeah, of course, of course.

1373
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,600
 You can't be allowed to shoot a hibernating bear.

1374
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:17,600
 You would hope so.

1375
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:19,600
 You would hope that a hibernating bear is protected regardless of...

1376
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:26,840
 If you're out there right now, listening, as you take aim, for two feet away, grow up, mate.

1377
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:31,040
 They said it's okay to take a photo selfie with a completely awake bear.

1378
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,040
 Yeah, fine.

1379
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,040
 All right.

1380
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,040
 Actively encouraged.

1381
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:40,120
 But also in Alaska, not just thinking about the bears here, we're also protecting moose.

1382
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:42,320
 You are not allowed to push one out of an aeroplane.

1383
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,320
 Just in case you ever had it.

1384
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:45,320
 You ever considered it.

1385
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:46,320
 Oh, yeah.

1386
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:47,320
 Not allowed.

1387
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:48,320
 I'm police ready to go now.

1388
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,320
 Yeah.

1389
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,320
 Yeah.

1390
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:51,320
 Yeah.

1391
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,320
 Okay.

1392
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:53,320
 That's it.

1393
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:54,320
 That is all of our facts.

1394
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:57,320
 Thank you so much for listening.

1395
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:00,320
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us about the things we've said over the

1396
