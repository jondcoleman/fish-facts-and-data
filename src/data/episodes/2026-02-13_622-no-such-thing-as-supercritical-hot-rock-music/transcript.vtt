00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.240
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Things A Fish,

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.400
 where we were joined by the brilliant Maddie Motte.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.400
 Now, if you have children of a certain age,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.320
 then you will know exactly who Maddie is.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.480
 She is often seen on the BBC doing various kid shows,

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.360
 especially once related to science communication.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.600
 But if you want to know more about her having heard her today on this show,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.640
 and I'm absolutely certain you will, then the best thing to do

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.880
 is to go to her YouTube channel.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.880
 So Maddie's YouTube channel is all about curiosity.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.680
 It's all about animals, about plants, about travel,

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.120
 about technology.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.360
 She is really right up her street.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.040
 She loves everything about knowledge,

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.120
 and her videos are absolutely fantastic.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.400
 And if you want to find them,

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.960
 then go to youtube.com/maddiemote,

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.320
 that's M-A-A-D-I-E-M-O-A-T-E,

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.800
 or just search for Maddie's name on the internet.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.280
 If you'd like to learn more about us,

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.840
 and what we're up to at the moment and in the future,

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.800
 then the best place probably at the moment is to go to Patreon.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.600
 you can sign up there.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.840
 You don't have to pay anything if you sign up.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.960
 It is a place to get little free bits of pieces here and there

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.560
 and learn about what's going on.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.840
 And then, of course, on top of that,

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.440
 we do have our various tiers.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.320

 you will get all sorts of amazing things.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.800

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.320
 really hope you enjoyed this show,

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.640
 with the Fantastic Maddie Mote.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.840
 On with the podcast.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:02:02.960
 [Music]

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.080
 Hello and welcome to another episode

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.680
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.360
 a weekly podcast coming to you

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.440
 from the QI offices in Hobern.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.560
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.640
 I'm sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.720
 James Harkin, and Maddie Mote.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.720
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.440
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.400
 And in a particular order, here we go.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.440
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Maddie.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.360
 Okay, so I thought I could pose this fact as a question,

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.040
 sort of a bit of a guessing game.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.800
 So the fact is, in 1988,

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.320
 one particular company had to recall 30 million flutes.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.240
 That is obviously important.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.520
 It's a lot of instruments.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.120
 So the question is,

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.880
 who is this company?

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.920
 - Flute makers. - Flute makers.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.200
 - Flute makers. - Obviously.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.000
 - Yeah. - Flute makers.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.080
 - And they didn't put all the holes in.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.000
 - They didn't, okay. - Oh, good call.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.200
 It's all those flutes.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.280
 It's just a stick, really, that they say now.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.800
 - I was thinking too many holes.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.800
 - Oh, okay. - Can you have too many holes

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.240
 in a flute, definitely.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.680
 - Yeah. - Can you?

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.960
 - Absolutely. - I think so.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.320
 I think it becomes a different instrument.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.720
 - It's only a better flute up to a point.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.480
 - Yeah, yeah. - I think so.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.800
 - I mean, you need your hands over the holes, don't you?

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.320
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - So you'd run out of fingers.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.000
 - Oh, but if you had a spare set of hands,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.520
 like a pantomine flute, you know,

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.640
 there's someone running the lower bit of the flute.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.680
 - A double flute.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.160
 Is that not a flute that go in both directions?

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.000
 - Like Darth Maul's lightsaber.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.880
 - Yeah. (laughing)

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.720
 - I feel we've stepped away for another question.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.840
 - To help you out, these flutes

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.000
 were actually branded cool flutes.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.960
 So I don't know if that has anything to do with helmets.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.360
 For kids, yeah, yeah, well for younger people.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.160
 And actually, it wasn't just flutes that were recalled,

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.880
 but also binoculars that were a little cardboard boxes

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:49.840
 with plastic lenses.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.360
 They were recalled at the same time.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.640
 - Okay, McDonald's.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.760
 - Yeah, I think you're on the mat track.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.440
 - Okay, Burger King.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.440
 (laughing)

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.800
 - So I could take, I'll go on out.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.000
 - Used to get toys in cereal.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.080
 - Absolutely, so there you go, bingo.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.800
 So these cool flutes, they were actually found

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.560
 in boxes of corn pops.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.640
 And they were recalled by Kellogg's, Kellogg cereal.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.640
 So it turns out these cool flutes,

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.480
 they were made up of two little tubes

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.800
 that sort of went into a mouthpiece.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.640
 And these tubes, they could fall out

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.160
 and they were a choking hazard.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.760
 So they had to recall 30--

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.520
 - You know what, they could have done with those flutes.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.320
 Mar holes.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.440
 (laughing)

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.360
 - So the reason I was looking at this in the first place

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.160
 is because I've been, I guess, fairly interested

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.560
 in just this whole world of collectible toys recently

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.960
 because it feels like we're getting a bit of a resurgence,

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.400
 the idea of blind boxes, toy collectibles is coming back.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.200
 - Oh, yeah.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.880
 - I was thinking, it was so, you know,

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.640
 what was my equivalent when I was younger

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.800
 in that for me was cereal box toys.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.400
 But then I sort of just started looking

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.560
 at the history of cereal box toys

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.880
 and the toys were kind of fascinating.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.160
 Like, do you remember any particular toys?

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.880
 - I think maybe my earliest ever memory

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.600
 is getting some Ghostbusters stickers

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.880
 from out of the cereal when the film came out.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.480
 - Wow. - So that was like early 80s, right?

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.280
 - Yeah.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.240
 I don't think I was allowed to get the kind of cereals

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.840
 which came with toys in them.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.000
 - Oh, no, they didn't have them in all branded day.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.080
 (laughing)

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.320
 - They just give you a little leaflet about your mortgage.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.960
 And that's the fun for you to read and find out.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.720
 - It's time for that me to fix this.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.560
 - What about you, Daniel?

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.560
 Did you ever get any?

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.280
 - I remember the whole enjoyment and excitement

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.120
 of getting them.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.560
 Right now I'm drawing a blank on the exact toys.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.560
 But I do remember, like, quite often

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.240
 they were within the pack itself.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.560
 You had to open up the plastic

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.280
 and you had to go through the fruit loops

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.280
 and a lot of families had a policy

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.160
 that you had to wait till it fell out during a war.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.560
 As opposed to just getting right in and grabbing it.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.760
 - Totally, it was whoever poured it into their bowl.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.080
 So that was the unwritten rule in our society.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.960
 - And you're an only child, aren't you?

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.360
 So you wouldn't have had this issue.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.640
 But obviously, if you've got three or four kids

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.560
 and you've only got one tie in a pack.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.400
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.400
 - Yeah, that's a big deal.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.320
 - Yeah, but I think that's fair enough

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.160
 the pouring out thing.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.240
 Like, you don't allow to plunge your hand

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.160
 into the Christmas pudding

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.840
 to allow the sick to sleep in.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:02.840
 That's not allowed.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.680
 (laughing)

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.920
 - I think I'd more incited to add these childhood.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.000
 (laughing)

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.920
 Like, one really interesting thing is

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.320
 the people who made them had to make them a certain weight.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.680
 And that is because of something

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.160
 called the Brazil Nut Effect.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.280
 That if you get lots of things

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.920
 that are different sizes and different weights

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.120
 and you jiggle them around,

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.680
 eventually the bigger things will end up at the top

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.840
 and the smaller things will end up at the bottom.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.120
 And this is something that's,

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.520
 you see this in all sorts of places,

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.360
 even like in avalanches,

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.440
 like the big bits of snow

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.280
 will be at the top and the small bits of the bottom.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.080
 But they had this specific size and weight of these toys

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.120
 so that they knew that if they were jiggled around

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.120
 in transport, the toy would always be kind of in the middle.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.120
 - Ah, that was nice.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.160
 - Ah, I didn't know that.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.640
 - Yes, what was yours?

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.480
 You haven't given us your idea.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.200
 - Well, so I remember the color changing spoon

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.480
 that I got in cocoa pops.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.480
 - It's you. - Thank you.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.480
 - Yeah, so when it would go into the cold milk,

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.520
 it would change color.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.360
 - Oh my god.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.840
 - But actually, one of those looking

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.400
 at the various toys they have been over the years,

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.160
 it very much started out as China cereal bowls

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.360
 that you would have to send off by collecting tokens

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.920
 on the back of boxes.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.440
 Then Kellogg sort of saw that they were doing

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.000
 this with quaker oats and Kellogg's were like,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.080
 we can get on the back of this.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.680
 So they started making these farm yard story books

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.440
 with various flaps that you could make

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.200
 funny animals out of.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.800
 And then that sort of like started the spiral of,

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.800
 okay, well, what else,

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.320
 what toys can we put inside the packets?

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.520
 And actually, this was sort of,

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.440
 I guess it became extremely popular

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.560
 after the Second World War.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.800
 So it's sort of looking at the atomic age.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.560
 So a lot of early cereal box toys are quite,

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.680
 literally yes.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.000
 - No, no, no.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:39.840
 - What?

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.160
 - It's genuinely.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.000
 - Oh my god.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.960
 - But genuinely radioactive toys

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.960
 were placed inside cereal boxes.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.200
 - Well, then you know where it is in the packet

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.360
 'cause you can see the glow.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.520
 - Yeah.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.120
 - When I was a kid that was at first,

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.120
 if you were at ReadyBrat,

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.280
 you would always have a glow around your whole body.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.680
 I didn't realize it was a ReadyBrat.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.520
 - Please.

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:57.920
 (laughing)

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.880
 - I remember if you had too much sunny delight,

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.320
 you sort of glowed orange,

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:02.160
 but I was a complete thing.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.440
 - You were all showing that right here.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.600
 - Yeah, yeah, totally.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:08.560
 But this toy was called the Lone Ranger Atomic Bomb Ring.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.560
 - genuinely.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.400
 - Oh my god.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.400
 - And you would get this inside Kix cereal,

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.160
 which you could get for 15 cents is in the US.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.000
 - Wow.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.320
 - It was a gold adjustable ring.

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.320
 There was a little removable cap

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.560
 at the back, a little red cap that you could take off,

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.280
 and that's where you could hide secret messages.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:26.040
 But then it contained something called,

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.400
 now I think I'm saying this right,

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:28.760
 but a spin tharoscope.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.760
 I don't know if anyone's heard of that before.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.240
 It's basically a little device

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.000
 that would contain a small amount of radioactive material.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.520
 So in this case, it's something called Pallonium 210.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:38.360
 - I've heard of Pallonium.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.520
 - There we go, Pallonium.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.360
 (laughing)

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.480
 - Yeah, normally like Pallonium has been deployed

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.360
 on the streets of London,

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.680
 not free Pallonium, and you'll say, what?

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.600
 - So this was, you know, radioactive material

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.840
 discovered by Marikiri.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.680
 Tiny small amounts of it were placed inside this ring,

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.280
 and then you would look into the atomic bomb

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.600
 through a little sort of lens that contains ink sulfide.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.440
 - Right.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.920
 - And as the Pallonium was decaying,

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.240
 obviously you've got alpha particles that are shedding,

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.200
 they're hitting the zinc sulfide screen,

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.520
 creating little flashes.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.880
 So the idea is your child could look inside the ring

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.000
 and actually see the simulations

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.320
 of this radioactive material.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.920
 - Yeah, it's the flute we recall.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.080
 (laughing)

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.520
 - And because it had choking pieces,

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.720
 yet this ring could be sort of taken apart

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:19.720
 with small caps and things,

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.520
 and apparently that's fine.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.200
 - That's extraordinary.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.920
 - I read this about this on Snopes, the website,

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.000
 and they said that there wasn't enough in it

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.080
 to do you any harm?

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:29.920
 - Right.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:33.000
 - Can I tell you guys my favorite serial promotion ever?

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:33.840
 - Please do.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:34.680
 - Yeah, we all have one.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.640
 - It's done by Quaker Oats.

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:38.480
 - Okay.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:39.320
 - It's 1954.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:45.720
 They bought 19 acres of land in Yukon,

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:49.600
 in the Yukon territory, gold rush country in Canada,

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.080
 and they divided up these 19 acres into

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:55.040
 21 million square inches.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:55.880
 - Right.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:00.760
 - 21 million property deeds, each one for one square inch,

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.440
 and if you sent in a box top,

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.720
 you would be sent a square inch of the Yukon.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:05.560
 - Wow.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:06.400
 - Wow.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.240
 - How interesting.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.080
 - When was this, Sandy?

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.080
 - 1954.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.600
 - Okay. - It was not legally binding.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:11.440
 - I'll come.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.280
 - Oh really?

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:13.120
 - What does that mean?

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.400
 Could you go along and dig in that tiny little hatch?

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.920
 - Yeah, let's go.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.120
 - We're like a team of your teaspoon,

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.480
 but you got in a serial box, man.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.960
 - One boy who got one sent in four toothpicks

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:24.800
 on some string and he said,

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.600
 "Can you fence my end drop please?"

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.480
 (all laughing)

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.520
 - That's amazing. - So sweet.

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:31.840
 - People do collect these ties.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:32.680
 Still don't they?

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:36.400
 I went on to eBay to see what kind of things I could buy

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.320
 from some little package. - Yeah, I did too.

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.400
 (all laughing)

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.480
 - Okay, what have we found?

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.680
 Maddie, what have you found?

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.080
 - Well, actually, it was the ring, the atomic bomb ring.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:48.400
 I found with the box was going for $645.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.920
 - The box makes a difference, doesn't it?

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.320
 - Yeah, it's huge difference.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.000
 - And it's not like, you know, if you buy like a Marvel

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.960
 superhero figurine or something,

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.640
 it has to be inside the box.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:01.360
 You just have the box next to it flattened with the tie next.

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:04.640
 - Oh, is that so that's the inside, the box or anything?

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:08.400
 I found one which was some cause monsters

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:11.600
 from Frank and Barry serial in America,

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.120
 and there were 1,700 pounds.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.800
 - Wow. - Wow.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.120
 - I don't see anything happening.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.120
 - It feels like a lot.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:18.960
 - Frank and Barry.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.040
 - You know, Frank and Barry, if you come across them,

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.280
 was it the 90s I think in America they had them?

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.320
 And they were a bit like, what are those serials

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.520
 that have little marshmallows in that have like,

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:28.520
 got leprechauns on?

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:29.840
 - Lucky charms. - Lucky charms, yeah, yeah.

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.560
 So it was like that when it was monsters.

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:36.000
 And the marshmallows were like pink and purple and stuff.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.920
 And the kids reat in it, and this die would go straight

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.920
 through them and come out of the toilet.

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.960
 And it looked like, you know, I've had this

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.440
 when my daughter eats beetroot.

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:46.440
 And I'm like, to my wife, believe it,

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.680
 believe it, we need to go to any of these.

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.440
 No, she had beetroot yesterday.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.400
 But like it would come out and they had a thing called

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.560
 Frank and Barry stool that was in like medical papers

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.520
 saying, this is right.

00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:59.720
 - It looks like people had blood in the paper.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:00.720
 - Was this one of the serials

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:04.120
 that was basically 95% of sugar?

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:04.960
 - Yes.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.720
 - With some, like, I don't want to say,

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.440
 'cause I think they might still be extant.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:10.800
 But yeah, I think there was a lot of sugar in them.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.600
 But the interesting thing about that is,

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.560
 so serials, Kellogg's, like the Kellogg's brothers,

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:19.200
 they had a sanatorium in North of America somewhere.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.040
 - That's crazy.

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.400
 - But like, Battle Creek, that's it.

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.880
 And there were two brothers,

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.520
 and one of the brothers decided

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.360
 we're gonna start putting sugar in it

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:29.200
 in order to attract younger people to eat it

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.600
 and not just be a health food,

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.160
 and they really fell out over that.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.800
 And they properly fell out.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.040
 - But ultimately, it was the fact

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.400
 that these were sugary serials,

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.200
 which is why we stopped getting serial box toys.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.920
 It was meant there were many factors,

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.800
 but one of them was the fact that these were

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.160
 slightly less nutritious foods.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.800
 I think there was, there was a pledge,

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.000
 it was a voluntary pledge,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.280
 which included the likes of General Mills and Kellogg's,

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.880
 they got together and they said,

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.400
 "Hey, you know what, it's not right for us

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.960
 "to push less nutritious foods at children,

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.920
 "which is why they started taking toys away."

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.880
 Although, first, they removed toys for children,

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:05.480
 but that's when they started putting in things

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:09.720
 like pedometers and reflective bike stickers.

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.480
 So they didn't sort of remove things on it.

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:13.480
 - Tell me more.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.240
 (laughing)

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.440
 - But yeah, so that was kind of their attempt to be like,

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:19.840
 "Okay, we're not putting toys in them,

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:23.560
 "but we've had sports-related gifts in."

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.200
 - Can I tell you guys something about a friend of the podcast?

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.600
 - Yes. - So, Henry Perky,

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:29.680
 you guys might remember?

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:30.520
 - Yeah.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:31.880
 - "Eventer of Shredded Wheat."

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:33.320
 - Yeah. - And father of the man

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:35.720
 who then invented round shredded wheat.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:36.560
 - Okay. - Yeah, yeah.

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.080
 - Very much at Nipo-Serie last minute.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:38.920
 - Absolutely.

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:40.080
 (laughing)

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:41.520
 - I thought it was knitted by Granny's.

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.720
 Can't believe it. (laughing)

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:44.880
 - A myth busted.

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:45.920
 (laughing)

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.840
 - But his initial intention was not

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:50.280
 making shredded wheat to sell them to people.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:53.080
 He wanted everyone to buy shredded wheat making machines.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:54.440
 This was his big thing.

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:55.280
 - Okay.

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:57.520
 - He created a machine which shredded wheat.

00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:58.360
 And then people just said,

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.960
 "Can we have some more of the shredded wheat, please?"

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.920
 And he said, "Anyone of the machine that makes it?"

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:05.400
 So they could've been, well, we'll be all hedge on our counter.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.440
 - Like a soda stream.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.680
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:08.520
 - Or an average.

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:10.440
 - I just slightly ran him a question for you, Maddie.

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:13.600
 So when I first moved to Australia when I was 12,

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:16.800
 I became star-struck when I met the voice

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.120
 of the Australian cocoa pop monkey.

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.440
 - I know the British one.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.000
 - Well, this is what I was gonna ask.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.960
 You must know all of these people

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.120
 because of what you do.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:25.960
 - Yeah.

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.400
 - The world of voices for these iconic characters.

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.240
 - This is so bizarre that you've asked me this

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.040
 because genuinely one of my best friends

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:34.200
 is the voice of the cocoa pop monkey.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.040
 - Oh my God.

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.040
 - No, I'm not even kidding.

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:36.880
 - Oh my gosh.

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:37.880
 - I'm genuinely, yeah.

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:38.720
 - Why?

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.120
 - Yeah, he does really well from it.

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:43.680
 But the cocoa pop monkey doesn't talk so much anymore.

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:46.480
 So as far as I'm aware, every couple of years,

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.480
 they'll say, "Hey, can you come to the recording booth

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:51.080
 "and he'll just have to record a giggle?"

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:51.920
 (laughing)

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:52.760
 - Yeah, I was gonna say,

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.480
 I know that cocoa would recognize his voice.

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.000
 - No, Tony the Tiger is the one that I'm gonna say.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:56.840
 - I would recognize it.

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.560
 If he was in the room next door,

00:14:58.560 --> 00:14:59.920
 if I was in a restaurant,

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.800
 Tony the Tiger was at the next table.

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:02.800
 - You'd ask to be moved.

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:03.800
 - No, I would recognize it.

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.280
 - Oh, I think so, you know what I mean?

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:06.120
 (laughing)

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.400
 - Guy, he thinks everything's great.

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:08.720
 - Yeah.

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:09.960
 - The guy's soup is not great.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.560
 (laughing)

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.680
 - Yeah.

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.120
 - As far as I know that in his many years

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.800
 of being the voice of the cocoa pop monkey, cocoa,

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.800
 I don't think the monkey talks much.

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:24.880
 Chocolatey goodness, something about 10 to the milk chocolatey.

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:26.400
 - Oh, you said that, yeah.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.480
 - I think that was kind of the catchphrase.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.440
 - That was a song when they briefly

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:32.720
 and ill-fatedly changed their name to chocolate crispies

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.600
 and then realized too late it didn't scan

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.800
 when I'd rather have a bowl of chocolate crispies.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.520
 (laughing)

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:40.360
 - Thank you, back.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:42.960
 (upbeat music)

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:46.480
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:47.720
 and that is my fact.

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:51.200
 My fact this week is that after years of publicly arguing

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.920
 that the Milky Way is the only galaxy in the universe,

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:56.400
 one of Harvard University's head astronomers

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:58.400
 realized that actually he was wrong

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:02.600
 and then went on to map 76,000 galaxies.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:03.440
 - So awkward.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.440
 (laughing)

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.280
 - Who was he?

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:08.280
 - His name was Harlow Shapley.

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:11.560
 He lived 1885 to 1972, American astronomer,

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:15.120
 and he served as the head of the Harvard College Observatory.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:18.720
 Now, what's amazing is up until the 1920s,

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:21.240
 most astronomers believe that our galaxy

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.440
 was the single galaxy in the universe.

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.280
 That was it.

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:25.920
 If we were expanding, it would have been into that.

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.640
 That was the idea of the time.

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:30.840
 So, suddenly a few scientists started coming up

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:33.560
 saying actually I think it might be a bit bigger.

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:35.640
 One of whom was Edwin Hubble.

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:39.520
 And Shapley really thought that this was junk science.

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:41.680
 He took part in a debate with a man called Curtis

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:43.360
 where they both presented their findings

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.480
 to say whether or not it was the case

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:46.640
 and he stuck with it.

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:50.920
 And so it wasn't until Hubble eventually showed him proof

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:54.040
 by sending him a letter of something that he discovered

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:57.360
 that he then said this is completely destroyed my universe

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:59.800
 and accepted it, which is the wonderful thing about science.

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:00.640
 It's not opinion.

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:04.920
 If the facts are in front of you, you can go onto map 76,000 galaxies.

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:05.720
 So, it's quite nice.

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.640
 That is such a good quote as well.

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:11.160
 This is the letter that destroyed my universe quite literally

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:12.440
 and in many, many ways.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.400
 I love that.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.160
 It's really cool.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:17.120
 This debate they had is known as the Great Debate

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:19.080
 between Shapley and Curtis.

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:23.120
 And basically, Curtis thought that there was extra galaxies.

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.320
 And Shapley thought that there was only one galaxy

00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:27.600
 but that we weren't in the middle of it.

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:29.120
 We were kind of on the side of it.

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:31.680
 And Curtis thought that we were in the middle of our galaxy

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.840
 and it turned out they were both wrong

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:37.000
 or both right at the same time, which again is quite good about science.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.200
 It's like you might be right, you might be wrong or more likely.

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:43.120
 You might be kind of right in some ways and wrong in some ways.

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:45.240
 Yeah, because we're not in the middle of our galaxy.

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:46.840
 We're on an arm, right?

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:49.080
 We're on an outer tentacle.

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:50.080
 Exactly.

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.600
 The giant great octopus.

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:52.840
 Thank you.

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:58.000
 The center of our galaxy is within the Sagittarius constellation

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 and actually it's the part of the Sagittarius constellation.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.840
 I think it's the five brightest stars

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:04.760
 that make up the shape of a teapot.

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:07.480
 So actually, the center of our galaxy, the Milky Way,

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:10.120
 is sort of just above the spout of a teapot.

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:11.520
 I know, it looks like a teapot.

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.240
 Shine British flag at the same time.

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:15.320
 Yeah, it's a very British flag.

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:16.560
 Yeah.

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:20.760
 So it was Edwin Hubble that basically proved Shapley that he was wrong.

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:23.560
 But this isn't the first time that Edwin Hubble has proved somebody wrong.

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:24.560
 Oh, really?

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:27.560
 In fact, he also proved Einstein wrong.

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:28.800
 At one point as well.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:32.480
 Back then, Albert Einstein was looking at his calculations of space

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:34.400
 and going, this doesn't really quite make sense

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:37.280
 because if gravity is such a big, important thing,

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:40.080
 then surely everything should be coming towards each other.

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.040
 Surely the galaxy should be shrinking.

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:43.320
 So to make sense of the math,

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:46.160
 he introduced this thing called a constant,

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.720
 a cosmological constant, which is just from now on.

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.080
 Space is static.

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:52.600
 I say it's still because that's what makes sense.

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:53.600
 Wow.

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.720
 And then Hubble came along and was like,

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:59.360
 oh, really sorry, but actually look at this, here's my proof.

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.960
 We now know about looking at the way light moves

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:02.960
 and looking at redshift.

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:05.560
 I can tell you that the universe is in fact expanding.

00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:07.240
 So I'm sorry, you're wrong.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.320
 And Einstein said, yeah, that was probably my greatest blunder.

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.040
 Why knock some down, doesn't he?

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:13.360
 Yeah.

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.520
 Hubble didn't have a funeral.

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:19.160
 His wife wouldn't tell anyone what had happened to him.

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:20.440
 I just find this mysterious.

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:22.520
 Oh, we know how he died, right?

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.040
 Like it was in a mysterious death.

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:25.800
 I don't know. But I know that he died.

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:28.960
 I think, yeah, I think probably he died normally.

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.480
 And then she just didn't tell us the location.

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:32.960
 What Einstein is, we're not saying

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.000
 there's anything nefarious going on with his wife.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.160
 Yeah, I'm not saying there isn't, though.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.160
 Are you?

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.920
 Well, I'm just not saying, I mean, it's a cold case.

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.000
 I'm saying, we don't know.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.840
 And that's actually the scientific method

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:45.920
 to just saying, don't know, and then hope someone else does the work.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.720
 No, he didn't have a funeral.

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:49.720
 And his wife refused to say either where he was buried

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.560
 or whether his ashes had been scattered or where

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:52.360
 or anything like that.

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:56.080
 And he was making lots of enemies of scientists

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:57.400
 by proving them wrong every day.

00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:58.400
 Exactly.

00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:59.200
 Exactly.

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.840
 There's no way to visit, but I guess he does have a fairly big telescope.

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:04.440
 Well, you know, it's just like the observatory up there now

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:06.320
 that we can all remember him by his face.

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:07.400
 Yes, you're right.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.120
 He didn't start out as a scientist.

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:11.840
 He started out thanks to family pressure studying law.

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:12.360
 Oh, yeah.

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:16.240
 Because his family taught him like there's no future in this science thing.

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:20.200
 And then he spent a year teaching high school physics, which I love.

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:22.000
 Imagine if Mr. Hubble was your...

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 Yes, he did.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000
 Just pretty cool.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 And basketball as well.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.800
 And he was very nifty on the basketball court.

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:27.800
 And not just Nifty.

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:30.200
 He was a major basketball player for his college.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:33.000
 And a lot of people said he could have become a professional

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.320
 in a couple of different sports.

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.840
 So he had that little decision to make.

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:37.840
 Well, those guys.

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:38.840
 Good evening.

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:39.840
 Good evening.

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:40.840
 Yeah.

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.840
 Shapley also had an interesting beginning

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:45.200
 because he was an incredibly clever kid.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.720
 He advanced in his school years, you know, those kids

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:50.320
 that you hear that graduate, you know, their high school

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:51.680
 when they're like nine.

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:54.040
 He was that kind of kid.

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:56.720
 And he didn't know what he wanted to study.

00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:00.400
 And he decided I'm going to just study and do in life what I see first

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:03.840
 on the list, the alphabetical list of subjects for college.

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:05.640
 He said he kept an acrobat.

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:09.240
 Yeah, but only because advox studies were full.

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:10.240
 Yeah.

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:14.600
 Yeah, he said he rejected archaeology because he couldn't pronounce it properly.

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:16.040
 So he picked astronomy.

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:21.200
 It's probably a nice mythology he's created for himself, but that's his claim.

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:26.480
 In the 40s, he rescued lots of his colleagues from the Nazis.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:31.800
 So lots of scientists in Germany, especially Jewish ones, were being victimized.

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:36.200
 And he got them out of there and brought them over to America and sort of signed, said,

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:39.200
 oh, they're going to be really important for our university.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.520
 So I'm going to get them out here.

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:44.520
 And they reckon he saved up at least a thousand families from the Nazis.

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:45.520
 Wow.

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:46.520
 That was Shapley.

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:47.520
 That was Shapley.

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:52.480
 So the stars will not be of much good to us if we do not preserve the minds with which to

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.640
 comprehend them.

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:58.160
 And then after that, he was accused of being a communist.

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:04.680
 And that's because in those days, you could be accused of being a premature anti-fascist.

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:10.440
 If you, if you, like, you were lads and not like you, this never happens.

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:17.160
 So, like, the idea is like you, if you didn't like the fascists in 1945, that was fine.

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:21.120
 But if you didn't like them in the 30s, that was dodgy in America.

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:25.000
 Because they were still, the idea was that Hitler was the one who saved Germany from communism.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.680
 Generally speaking, in America, people were not massively anti the Nazis until the war.

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:30.680
 Yeah.

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:34.320
 And so if you could be seen to be anti them before the war, people thought you were a communist.

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:35.320
 Oh, gosh.

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:36.320
 Isn't that amazing?

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:40.040
 So you had a narrow window to say, you know what?

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.760
 I'm not sure about these guys.

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:43.760
 I hear about these.

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:49.920
 Well, yeah, he appeared before the Un-American Activities Committee, the McCarthy Committee.

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:50.920
 Oh, sure.

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:51.920
 But yeah.

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.200
 Yeah, really interesting guy.

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:54.200
 Yeah.

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.600
 That's fascinating.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:23:02.640
 So the, the star that was spotted by Hubble is arguably the second most important star

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:03.640
 in the universe.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:05.440
 So is this the one that proved that we are?

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.440
 Yeah, right.

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:08.080
 Yeah, it's called V1.

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:10.840
 And it's located in the Andromeda Nebula.

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:13.240
 It's 2.2 million light years away.

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:18.200
 And it has 1/100th of the brightness of the faintest star that is visible to our naked eye.

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:19.200
 Right.

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:24.800
 And I've read that it's often used as a marker for when you're judging other galaxies now.

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:27.720
 Because you need a marker point to go where it's further and where it's not.

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:28.720
 Yeah.

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:32.080
 So because it's a little bit dimmer, they can go that is definitely really far away.

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:33.080
 Yeah.

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:35.960
 Way, way further away than anything that could be within our galaxy.

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:36.960
 Exactly.

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:37.960
 Yeah.

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:38.960
 Yeah.

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:39.960
 Yeah.

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:40.960
 It's pretty amazing.

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:44.640
 The naked eye, if you really, really, really look, it just looks like a smudge if it's really

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:45.640
 dark.

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:46.640
 Right.

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.480
 They thought it was a star for a long time, and then it was only of course when they got these

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:51.320
 really good telescopes, you could tell that it was a group of stars.

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.240
 That's quite a close galaxy, I presume.

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:54.240
 Closest, I think.

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.240
 Is it?

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.240
 Maybe.

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.240
 It's one of our closest.

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:59.080
 I think one day the Andromeda is going to crash into ours.

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:00.080
 All right.

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:03.240
 You don't need to worry about it because it'll be like in millions and millions and millions

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:04.240
 of years.

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:05.240
 Yeah.

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:07.640
 But I've also read that if two galaxies are going to crash into each other, the size of

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:10.760
 galaxies would mean that you would just pass through each other and not notice.

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:11.760
 What?

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:12.760
 Oh, that's cool.

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:13.760
 Yeah.

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:16.520
 The space in between each place in a galaxy is so great.

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:17.520
 Yeah.

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:18.520
 It's so easy to be some collisions.

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:19.520
 We've all just...

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:23.960
 What's playing in the alley, I think, is that the gravity would pull them kind of together

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:26.480
 and they would join the mass of the stars.

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:27.480
 Right.

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:30.680
 There'll be some dents in the fender, I'm sure, at the end of the process.

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:31.680
 Yes.

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:36.760
 50 billion of the stars in our galaxy now, they arrived here eight billion years ago

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:41.000
 when our galaxy collided with another galaxy called the sausage galaxy.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.000
 Amazing.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 Amazing.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:48.000
 I don't even know where to believe you.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 It's true.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000
 It's true.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 It's sometimes...

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.640
 It's sometimes called the Gaia Enceladus Galaxy.

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:55.640
 Definitely.

00:24:55.640 --> 00:25:00.120
 And some places called the sausage galaxy and it collided with ours and we've got a lot

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:01.120
 of stars from around here.

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:02.120
 The sausage and teapot.

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:03.120
 It's basically what we're talking about.

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:04.120
 It's an English breakfast.

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:09.760
 It's just one giant full English that we're living in.

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:13.800
 But on the sausage front, I do think some astronauts have reported just generally space

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:18.800
 to smell a little bit like barbeque and barbeque, yeah, because when they've come back in

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:24.080
 after a spacewalk, they've noticed the scent of barbeque on their spacesuits.

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:25.080
 Wow.

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:28.320
 But also in terms of what does space smell like.

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:33.120
 If we actually look at the Milky Way, so our galaxy, there is an area within the Milky

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:37.880
 Way, got this giant cloud of gas and dust, you've got this a star forming region.

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:41.840
 And they discover that it was packed full of this chemical known as Ethyl Formates, which

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:45.720
 is responsible for giving both raspberries and rum, their flavour.

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:46.720
 Oh.

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:51.880
 So not only do we have the teapot and sausages, we also have rum and raspberries as well.

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:52.880
 Oh, and milk.

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:53.880
 Milk for the tea.

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:54.880
 The Milky Way.

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:55.880
 Of course.

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:56.880
 Yeah.

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:57.880
 How exciting.

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:04.200
 See, we should acknowledge as well a quick shout out to Henrietta Swan Levit, who was known

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:08.800
 as a human computer, and at one point also worked at Harvard University's observatory many,

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:11.840
 many years before Shapley got there.

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:17.560
 She's the person who worked out a thing about the rate of pulses coming out of the star,

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:19.880
 which was then used by Hubble.

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:20.880
 Now I see.

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:24.600
 So she kind of like came up with a standard of this is how you can work out how far away

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:28.680
 the star is by measuring the luminosity of its pulses.

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:35.200
 Now you measure luminosity and crabs, I think, which is the crab nebula has a certain

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.200
 luminosity.

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:38.080
 It's a certain luminosity.

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:41.160
 And it's like, is it brighter or less bright than the crab nebula?

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:45.160
 So something seven crabs, it's seven times brighter than the crab nebula.

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:50.240
 Is this just a big, like, bar and grill restaurant out of space?

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:51.240
 Yeah.

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:52.240
 I don't mind it.

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:53.240
 We should start a themed restaurant.

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:56.320
 The menu is looking really, really good.

00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:01.480
 I guess, I don't know, but with these, the pulsars, with these stars and a pulsing, the

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:04.840
 sephid stars that we're able to measure distance with, I'm assuming that they're very,

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:09.480
 very unlikely to have life around them, because the light they're emitting is so, so unreliable.

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:13.400
 I've got a room at the moment with a bulb, which is dodgy, and you can't be in that room.

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:18.400
 It's on one of the old dimmer switches, and we put a new dimmer bulb in, and it's just

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:19.880
 an absolute nightmare to be in.

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:20.880
 I hate that.

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:21.880
 Yeah.

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:23.880
 That makes sense to me.

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:24.880
 That's crazy.

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:25.880
 But it's not really hot.

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:27.680
 Thank you, Professor.

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:32.880
 Why really like about this thing about chaply and Hubble is they suddenly increased the size

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:33.880
 of the universe?

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:34.880
 Yes.

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:35.880
 Right?

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:41.040
 So we start with Tollamy all the way back in ancient times, and he thought that the entire

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:44.800
 universe was 20,000 times the Earth's radius.

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:45.800
 20,000?

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:46.800
 Okay.

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:50.640
 And he worked out out by saying, okay, well, the Earth is here in the middle.

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:54.480
 Everything goes round us, and then there's Mercury and Venus and the Sun and Mars and Jupiter,

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:58.160
 and then there's something else and something else, and eventually you get to the stars.

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:02.080
 And he had this nice little sort of nesting tables where everything goes, and he worked

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:03.080
 that out.

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:07.040
 And then Newton comes along and says, okay, well, the stars don't seem to move much according

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:15.600
 to each other, so they don't have parallax, which is parallax is like if you put your thumb

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:20.920
 in front of your face and then close one eye and close the other, it seems to move, but

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:23.560
 if you do it with something far away, it moves much less.

00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:26.760
 So he worked out with the stars, they're not doing that, so they must be really far away.

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:29.600
 So that got the universe much, much bigger.

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:34.160
 And then the guy called Friedrich Bessel, he managed to work out the parallax, so there

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:40.160
 is slight parallax and worked out that the, now the universe is light years in size.

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:41.760
 And then we got this great debate.

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:46.880
 We worked out that there's more than one galaxy, and then they found background radiation,

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:51.640
 which meant that suddenly the universe is, we don't know how big it is, but the observable

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:55.560
 universe is as far as light could get to us from when the universe started.

00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:56.560
 Yes.

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:57.560
 And I've heard that.

00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:59.360
 I just love how it kind of inspires.

00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:00.360
 It's really cool.

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:01.360
 Yeah.

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:02.360
 How much further should we go?

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:03.360
 I'm sure it wouldn't be at some stage.

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:04.360
 It'll get bigger still.

00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:05.360
 We just don't know how.

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:06.360
 We don't know how.

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:07.360
 Yeah.

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:08.360
 So cool.

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:09.360
 Well, this is I think, you know, the new James Webb Space Telescope.

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:10.360
 Yeah.

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:11.360
 Very, very big telescope.

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:14.400
 I've pushed into orbit for, for better views and things like that.

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:20.200
 And it has found six enormous ancient galaxies, which would be nicknamed the universe breakers.

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:21.200
 And I love this.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.720
 And they shouldn't exist, right?

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:23.720
 Wow.

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:24.720
 Wow.

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:28.520
 There should only be, from the point of where they are, you know, we know how long the light

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:29.520
 has taken to travel to us.

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:31.040
 We know the rough age they are.

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:35.520
 They should not have had time to form, because they date to 500 million years after the

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:36.520
 big bang.

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:39.640
 There should only be tiny baby galaxies there, but they're very well developed.

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:44.560
 And please tell me they look like a Hushbrown.

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:52.400
 We need it on the menu.

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:53.400
 Okay.

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:55.440
 There's time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

00:29:55.440 --> 00:30:03.720
 My fact is, the first ever geothermal power station powered five light bulbs or some

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:07.040
 sources say full, but I prefer that I'm backing it.

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:08.560
 I think it's the source I found.

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:09.560
 Yeah.

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:14.440
 And fifth one, it was liable, but it kept going on and off, and it was really a way.

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:17.640
 I just have to tell it off after working the dark.

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:23.880
 This was in 1904, and we're in Tuscany, or lovely, lovely, but with an anti-painter picture.

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:24.880
 Absolutely.

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:29.760
 Well, just hear those Tuscany, local animals and flora and fauna.

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:31.760
 Glass of Montipolciano.

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:32.760
 Beautiful.

00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:34.040
 Overlooking the Tower of Pisa.

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:35.040
 Probably.

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:41.440
 The Taurus kind of pretending to hold it up.

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:44.160
 And this is in an area called the Devil's Valley.

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:48.640
 Oh, it's not the Tower of Pisa.

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:52.600
 But I suppose it's appropriate that it was the Devil's Valley because we're going underground

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:54.560
 into the warm.

00:30:54.560 --> 00:31:01.960
 And this was where a guy called Prince Piano or Ginori Conti lit up the first ever geothermal

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:02.960
 power station.

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:04.960
 So that is taking.

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:07.800
 We need from underground, bringing it above ground.

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:10.400
 And there are various different ways you can harness the power.

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:15.520
 One of them is by directly using steam from underground to turn a turbine, which then spins

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:17.400
 up and generates electricity.

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:20.200
 There are lots of different methods of doing it, which I'm sure we'll get into.

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:23.840
 But this first little experiment did four or five light bulbs.

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:24.840
 That's so tiny.

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:25.840
 That's so cool.

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:29.480
 But it's the cradle of geothermal, which is now being talked of as a big solution to

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:33.840
 lots of power shortages and a much, much cleaner way of powering the world than fossil.

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:35.760
 So there's a lot of renewed excitement about it.

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:36.760
 And it's still going, isn't it?

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:40.920
 Over a hundred years later, that exact spot they have a huge factory that is producing

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:41.920
 geothermal.

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:42.920
 Yeah.

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:47.440
 That Devil's Valley was the landscape that inspired Dante to make hell in divine comedy.

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:50.680
 So when he writes about hell, he's talking about that place.

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:51.680
 Oh my goodness.

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:52.680
 That's cool.

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:53.680
 That's so cool.

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:56.320
 So not the picture I've seen painting for his at all.

00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:57.320
 That's wrong.

00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:59.320
 It'd be opposite.

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:00.320
 Yeah, really amazing.

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:01.320
 This guy was here, Prince.

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:04.080
 So I read he was Prince of Trevich Nano.

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:05.080
 I think he was.

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:06.280
 I couldn't get to the bottom of that either.

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:09.760
 It's sort of in some places it didn't mention it and then other places suddenly Prince was attached

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:10.760
 to his name.

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:11.760
 I think he was.

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.240
 I think he was narrows the correct.

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:14.240
 He was.

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:15.240
 I'm afraid.

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:20.600
 Second mention for the fascist in the show, he was made for the Mussolini before or after

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:21.800
 it all went wrong.

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:24.800
 He was friends when it was fashionable in Italy to be friends with Mussolini.

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:26.800
 I don't know what happened after the war.

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:27.800
 Okay.

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:28.800
 Yeah.

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:29.800
 Well, I know what happened to Mussolini.

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:30.800
 Oh, I know.

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:33.600
 But he was processing Boracacid.

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:34.600
 Yes.

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:35.600
 Where is that?

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:36.600
 Boracacid.

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:37.600
 Boracacid.

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:38.600
 From this particular area.

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:39.600
 Yeah, exactly.

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:45.540
 And then he realised that he could make electricity from it and then started this geothermal

00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:46.540
 company afterwards.

00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:47.540
 Didn't he?

00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:48.540
 Right.

00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:52.040
 I'm surprised it's first happened in Tuscany actually because when I think of areas of geothermal

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:57.320
 activity, I immediately think of Iceland and that's kind of where I immediately go.

00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:03.220
 I think Italy's a relatively big user of geothermal, despite it's a tiny, tiny percentage

00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:04.220
 of its power.

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:06.600
 They do have a few volcanoes there, don't they?

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:07.600
 Oh, yeah.

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:08.600
 That's what I suppose.

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:09.600
 Yeah.

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:10.600
 And basically, that's the thing.

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:16.160
 Traditional geothermal relies on very specific conditions, which is it's tectonic things, lots

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:19.760
 of heat close to the surface so you don't need to drill down for miles and miles.

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:22.240
 So Iceland is brilliant because it's got exactly that.

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:24.640
 Kenya is very good for it.

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:30.680
 Iceland has installed underfloor heating outdoors, nice outdoors, like, under the roads and

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:31.680
 tables.

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:32.680
 Yeah.

00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:35.360
 It's got so much warm water just you just place the surface.

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:37.360
 They just have, they're stunning.

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:38.360
 That's very clever.

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:39.360
 Yeah.

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:40.360
 It's very clever.

00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:45.720
 They also have the, they grow more bananas in glass houses in Iceland than they do anywhere

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:46.720
 else, which I think.

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:47.720
 Really?

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:48.720
 Yeah.

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:49.720
 I know they don't.

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:53.200
 So they aren't growing bananas commercially to sell because they don't actually have enough

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:59.000
 light to sort of the turnover of bananas to be good enough, but they do have a lot of geothermally

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.000
 heated greenhouses.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.000
 Right.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.520
 So I think they can get enough heat going.

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:08.040
 I think the greenhouses have to be around 20 degrees permanently to get the bananas to grow,

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:12.040
 but then to also be using the geothermal energy to provide enough light that the bananas

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:13.040
 would also need.

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:14.040
 Yeah.

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:15.040
 It's just not commercially viable.

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:17.760
 So they're like dark bananas that you can harvest?

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:18.760
 Dark.

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:19.760
 In the eight-month night.

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:26.360
 They'll put a bit of light on, but I just don't think it's enough because they need so much

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:27.360
 light.

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:28.360
 Okay.

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:32.720
 But also tomatoes, various tropical fruits, algae, they've grown a lot of algae now using geothermal

00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:33.720
 energy in Iceland.

00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:34.720
 Lovely.

00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:37.520
 Just scrape it off to get your spoon relieved of the superfood.

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:38.520
 Yeah.

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:41.480
 In case you haven't picked it up really, I've got a reputation as the guy on the show who likes

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:42.480
 the boring stuff.

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:43.480
 Oh.

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:48.240
 It's just slightly unfair because we all like the barring stuff.

00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:49.240
 Yeah.

00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:51.720
 They really get excited, don't they?

00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:55.320
 Underfloor heating, invented by the Romans.

00:34:55.320 --> 00:35:00.320
 They had like your house or your villa would be maybe a few metres above the ground or a

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:05.800
 metre above the ground, and then people would set fires or boil water underneath and that

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:07.480
 would get you on.

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:13.560
 But they put geothermal underfloor heating in Bath in the city of Bath in the UK, because

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:16.160
 down there there's quite a lot of hot springs and stuff.

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:20.480
 They could actually have, there's a few villas in Bath where you would get their geothermal

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:21.480
 stuff.

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:22.480
 It's amazing.

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:26.720
 Isn't it incredible that ancient Rome 2,000 years ago has underfloor heating and yet I

00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:27.720
 don't.

00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:28.720
 You don't know what I mean.

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:29.720
 You can do it.

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:30.720
 You can do it.

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:33.440
 It's such a pain of the bum to put in, you know?

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:34.440
 Yeah.

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:35.440
 Yes.

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:37.200
 Like why didn't they put it into my home whenever they were building it?

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:38.200
 Yes.

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:39.200
 What's going on?

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:40.200
 Why is that?

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:42.880
 I think in the UK we don't necessarily need it that much, because we don't really get

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:45.360
 very hot, very cold days.

00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:52.000
 I had it in my home in South East London when I lived there in our bathroom, but as the

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.480
 builder was putting the final tile down he accidentally shredded one of the wires and

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:58.400
 there was too expensive to do anything about it.

00:35:58.400 --> 00:35:59.400
 What do you mean?

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:00.400
 We have read it.

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:01.920
 He just said one of the shredded wheat machines.

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:02.920
 That's amazing.

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:07.520
 Basically he said that he did something to one of the wires and so it never worked.

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:08.520
 Oh yeah.

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:09.520
 But it was there.

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:10.520
 So it's all there.

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:11.520
 It's all there.

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:12.520
 Just it never worked.

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:14.520
 So we technically had it.

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:15.520
 And we would always think about it.

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:20.480
 It's been a big consolation as you walked in onto the freezing cold floor in the winter morning.

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:21.480
 We would tell people who visited.

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:22.800
 Then we got under a floor heating.

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:23.800
 It doesn't work.

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:24.800
 But we have it.

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:25.800
 Yeah.

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:26.800
 Did he still pay him?

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:27.800
 Yeah.

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:28.800
 Yeah.

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:29.800
 I mean, he was.

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:30.800
 He's still working.

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:31.800
 It doesn't work.

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:32.800
 It's a scary trait.

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:33.800
 It's fault wires break.

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:34.800
 Wow.

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:35.800
 Wow.

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:36.800
 It doesn't make me think though.

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:41.920
 You know, like if someone in the past had made a slightly different decision, it would

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:45.880
 we be using geothermal energy more across the world because obviously there are some places

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:48.880
 where it makes sense to use it because it's easier to access.

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:54.320
 But I guess if you drill down deep enough, eventually you are going to tap into geothermal

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:55.320
 energy.

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:58.760
 So why is it we're not using it more because it does make an awful lot of sense?

00:36:58.760 --> 00:36:59.760
 It's just a pain to get down.

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:00.760
 It's just a pain to drill.

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:01.760
 It's an initial pain.

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:02.760
 That's the process.

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:04.760
 It's very expensive to set up.

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:05.760
 Exactly.

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:09.600
 And if you do it the old way where you're looking for quite a hot magma field.

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:10.600
 Yeah.

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:13.520
 If you go deep enough anywhere, you're going to get hot.

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:17.760
 But what they want to do is find somewhere that's not that deep and dig down.

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:19.480
 Those places are really hard to find.

00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:23.040
 It's not like, you know, it's obvious because these trees grow there, so it's going to be

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.040
 there.

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:27.800
 But you basically have to keep digging until you find the right place.

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:28.800
 Right.

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:34.720
 And there's recently, they've used AI in Nevada to find these zones where you can dig

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:35.720
 into.

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:37.760
 And they don't really know how the AI's found it.

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:41.320
 They're basically putting all the information of all the different zones around the world

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:45.520
 where you can get this easy geothermal energy.

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:48.400
 And the AI models have just found the signal out of the noise.

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:52.360
 It's just like they've worked out where it is even though they're not quite sure how they

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:53.360
 did it.

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:54.360
 But it does work.

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:55.360
 Wow.

00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:56.360
 It's one good use of it.

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:57.360
 Yeah.

00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:03.600
 And now they've got enough energy from the geothermal to pay for one AI question.

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:09.560
 As we said, it's tricky to do everywhere because digging down is expensive and it's more economical

00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:13.480
 if there's lots of heat closer to the surface, which is only true in a few places.

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:16.360
 So there are lots of things being tried to get around this now.

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:20.480
 One of them is just most heat you need unless it's like industrial heat for a factory is

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:21.480
 actually pretty low.

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:26.000
 And so that's these boreholes, the ground source heat pump thing, like China's going gangbusters

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.000
 on that.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.880
 And there are other kind of wacky versions of geothermal.

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:35.440
 There's enhanced, there's advanced, and there's super critical hot rock.

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.440
 Okay.

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:37.440
 I'm going to choose the last one.

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:39.440
 That's a cool kind of rock music.

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:40.440
 Yeah.

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:41.440
 That should be a genre.

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:42.840
 Yeah, I should know.

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:46.800
 So here's an idea that's being experimented with.

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:51.760
 You drill a couple of holes, you drill down a mile or two, right?

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:53.560
 Two separate shafts.

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:56.440
 You then drill sideways between the shafts, okay?

00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:57.440
 So you've joined them up.

00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:59.240
 You've made a sort of like a U shape.

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:00.240
 Like a U shape.

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:02.240
 Exactly.

00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:08.840
 Then you pump water down hole one, and you pumping it towards hole number two, and you're sort

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:11.000
 of cracking the rocks along the way.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.640
 And the water is taking all the heat out of these rather hot rocks, and then the water is

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:19.480
 pumped out of a second well, and it's at 200 degrees Celsius.

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:23.720
 How can it be at 200 degrees water, boils at 100 degrees?

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:25.680
 Ah, must be high pressure.

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:27.080
 It's high pressure.

00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:28.800
 It's really high pressure.

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:35.080
 So you get this thing, you get super heated, sort of super critical steam, which can drive

00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:39.560
 a turbine extremely well, or you just use that heat to actually heat up other water,

00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:40.560
 which then drives a turbine.

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:42.680
 Like there are different methods of doing it.

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:43.680
 It's very, very cool.

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:46.080
 It's actually quite similar to fracking, isn't it?

00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:47.080
 It's basically fracking.

00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:48.080
 It's basically fracking.

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:52.280
 So they use the technology that fracking did to get oil out, but instead of doing that,

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:54.280
 they put water in and heated it up.

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:55.280
 Exactly.

00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:56.280
 Exactly.

00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:59.920
 Well, that happy about it, because fracking can cause earthquakes.

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:00.920
 Yes.

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:01.920
 Right.

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:02.920
 So yeah.

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:03.920
 But is it a better way to use fracking technology potentially?

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:04.920
 Well, undoubtedly.

00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:05.920
 Yeah.

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:08.160
 Because you're getting, it's much greener.

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:12.600
 Another way you can do it is instead of using water, you might be able to use hydrogen.

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:16.760
 This is something called the Johnson Thermoelectric Energy Converter.

00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:20.640
 And the best thing about it is it's solid state, so you put it into the water, and it's just

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:25.440
 one object, you put it in, and then it gets electricity out of it.

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:30.520
 And it was invented by a guy called Lonnie Johnson, who also invented the super-soaker.

00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:32.520
 Isn't that amazing?

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:36.520
 I thought I recognized that name for someone.

00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:37.520
 Yeah.

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:38.520
 Wow.

00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:43.720
 It's very, very, at the moment, they're not using it, but it might be used in the future.

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:50.160
 And this guy is, wants to use it in L.A., where they have a lot of, like, old oil wells,

00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:54.360
 so they've already got the holes down there, so you can just put stuff down there.

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:57.680
 The moment the temperature in those oil wells is too low, and you can't really get much

00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:01.280
 geothermal out, but because this is so efficient, you might be able to use it.

00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:02.280
 That's interesting.

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:05.760
 By anyway, he invented the super-soaker, so I mean, yeah.

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:09.800
 The difference in those two inventions is, like, the equivalent of Einstein doing E equals

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:10.800
 M to E square.

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:13.280
 It's, like, what are you going to do for his next equation?

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:15.280
 Viva 6 afraid of 7.

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:16.280
 789?

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:19.320
 Like, that's that similarity.

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:28.800
 Okay, it's time for our final fact to the show, and that is James.

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:29.800
 Okay.

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:37.840
 My fact this week is that in Peru, you can be sued by a B.

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:45.960
 And he's got 20 million witnesses.

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:49.680
 I don't really know. It has to be a stingless B.

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:56.760
 It has to be in one of two parts of Peru, the town of Sapito, or the Loretto department,

00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:59.080
 but they're both in the Amazon.

00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:05.040
 And it turns out that these areas have stingless bees that are very, very important to indigenous

00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:11.600
 communities, and they've been hurt by pollution, climate change, habitat loss, all that kind

00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:12.600
 of stuff.

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:16.400
 So, these two areas of Peru have given them rights.

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:22.200
 And while the B cup fill out the paperwork, a human can act on their behalf.

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:26.680
 And so, if, like, let's say, a tree-felling company comes into the Amazon, cuts down a load

00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:35.160
 of habitat of these bees, then a environmental company can go over and sue them on behalf

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:36.160
 of the bees.

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:38.080
 Can I sue a B?

00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:39.880
 Yeah, if they have rights.

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:42.880
 And just those two places.

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:43.880
 They're stingless.

00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:46.240
 So, I think the best they could do is give you a little nibble.

00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:47.240
 They can bite.

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:48.240
 Those bees can bite.

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:49.520
 Why are you going to sue them?

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:53.480
 I'm just trying to work out what this new right has given them as a flip-byde coin.

00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:54.480
 It's fine.

00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:55.480
 It's fine.

00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:56.480
 It's fine.

00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:57.480
 It's fine.

00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:58.480
 Yeah.

00:42:58.480 --> 00:42:59.480
 Sorry.

00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:00.480
 It's a cup breakdown.

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:01.480
 But classic.

00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:02.480
 A hive chaser.

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:06.480
 But also, can you sue a single B? Or does it have to be the colony?

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:07.480
 Oh.

00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:12.080
 See, I wonder if you can take up a personal agreement with A-B.

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:13.080
 A-B.

00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:16.080
 Rowan Atkinson has just made a very successful series about this, isn't it?

00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:17.080
 Oh, yeah.

00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:18.080
 Man vs B.

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:22.240
 They don't cover series two of Man vs B, which is just the legal battle after this.

00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:23.240
 Set in the Amazon.

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:24.240
 Yeah.

00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:26.240
 They did some cool these bees.

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:27.240
 They're amazing.

00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:29.880
 There's one big lie about stingless bees.

00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:30.880
 Yeah.

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:31.880
 They do have stings.

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:32.880
 What?

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:33.880
 Yes, they do.

00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:34.880
 I didn't know this.

00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:36.880
 I mean, I didn't know the stingless bee was a thing until this week.

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:39.480
 That's a roller coaster that you've been on.

00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:40.480
 Oh, my God.

00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:41.480
 There's a thing called a stingless bee.

00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:42.480
 Oh, my God.

00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:43.480
 They have stings.

00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:44.480
 I know.

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:45.480
 I did.

00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:46.480
 I thought are the harmless.

00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:47.480
 But they're not.

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:50.320
 So the stings are called degenerate stings, because they're so small and ineffective that

00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:51.320
 they don't count.

00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:52.320
 No.

00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:53.320
 I know.

00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:56.800
 But they do, as you said, Dan, they bite like the devil.

00:43:56.800 --> 00:44:01.680
 They'll do suicidal biting, which is a biological term, which is where they bite and bite

00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:02.680
 and bite and bite.

00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:03.680
 Yeah.

00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:04.680
 You.

00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:05.680
 Just you.

00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:06.680
 Yeah.

00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:14.440
 Going after the bees, they're coming view Dan.

00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:18.440
 And basically, they will keep biting and if you try and pull them away, yeah.

00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:21.480
 They will suffer fatal damage to their body rather than stop biting.

00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:22.480
 Okay.

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:23.480
 They head off.

00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:24.480
 Yeah, exactly.

00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:25.480
 Yeah.

00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:30.680
 So they will just clamp down their jaws with so much vigor that they just will not let

00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:31.680
 go.

00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:33.080
 Like a dangerous dog.

00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:34.080
 Like a dangerous dog.

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:37.640
 You know, they always say that the dogs will clamp onto you and they won't like go unless

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:39.240
 you put your finger up the body.

00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:40.240
 That is true.

00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:43.280
 And I don't suppose you could do that with a bee.

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:44.280
 No.

00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:48.280
 And there's a useless thing in the way.

00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:50.760
 But those are suicidal tendencies.

00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:52.720
 We see that in bees' withstings as well.

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:53.720
 Oh, really?

00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:59.200
 So the bees that we have in here in Europe, in UK, aethysmelaferra, they will sting you.

00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:03.080
 But sadly, when they sting you, the sting will, the barbs will get stuck in your skin

00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:05.080
 and this essentially rips out their abdomen.

00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:06.080
 Right.

00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:09.120
 So I guess we're seeing the same behavior in the stingless bee.

00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:13.800
 It's just that they are physically choosing to not let go when they could.

00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:18.320
 So that instinct to protect is so intense that, yeah, you're a beekeeper, aren't you?

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:19.320
 Yeah.

00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:20.320
 How many?

00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:21.320
 How many have you got?

00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:22.320
 70,000.

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:23.320
 What?

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:24.320
 It's all there.

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:25.320
 And their names are.

00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:26.320
 70,000.

00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:27.320
 Yeah, I'd say.

00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:28.320
 I'd say that.

00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:29.320
 Yeah.

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:30.320
 How many hives is that?

00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:35.120
 That's at the moment because it's January, so the hives, they significantly decrease in numbers

00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:36.120
 over the winter.

00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:39.280
 But yeah, I would say in the height of the summer, around 70,000.

00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:40.280
 So cool.

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:41.280
 And gals.

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:43.120
 Have you been stung?

00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:44.120
 Many times.

00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:45.120
 I've seen you.

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:46.120
 Many times.

00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:47.120
 Yeah.

00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:48.120
 So certainly do have stings.

00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:50.120
 Where's the most painful spot?

00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:51.120
 Oh, painful.

00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:53.120
 The most annoying was on my forehead.

00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:55.160
 I sort of looked like a Star Trek character.

00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:57.560
 I remember that for quite some time.

00:45:57.560 --> 00:45:58.880
 That took a long time to go down.

00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:02.680
 I do have to be careful, though, because every time I get stung, I think I'm reacting a little

00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:05.400
 bit more every single time, so I do need to be cautious.

00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:06.400
 Yeah.

00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:07.400
 That's very cool.

00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:09.440
 And do you use the honey for yourself?

00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:12.080
 Do you sell it in local shops and farm markets?

00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:13.080
 No, no.

00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:18.720
 I would say, I would say, only just about get enough honey to sort of maybe get me through

00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:19.720
 a few months.

00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:20.720
 Okay.

00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:26.080
 So me, extracting the honey is, it's something that has been developed over hundreds and

00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:30.760
 more than thousands of years, the bees, they will store their honey in honeycomb.

00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:36.200
 We encourage them to store that honey in frames that can be easily removed from the hive.

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:39.800
 But stingless bees, you can also harvest their honey.

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:44.320
 It's just much harder, because stingless bees don't make honeycomb.

00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:49.080
 Instead, they store their honey in little sort of tiny honey pots that are about the size

00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:54.120
 of grapes, and they're all, yeah, so they're all sort of like a little Winnie the Pooh.

00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:55.120
 Yeah.

00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:56.120
 They're all nested together.

00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:57.120
 What's it made of?

00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:58.120
 What's the pot?

00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:03.640
 So it's, it's similar to a sort of a sticky substance that European bees make, which is

00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:09.240
 called propolis, which is a combination of wax, but you also get various tree sats and

00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:15.240
 resins as well in the mix, so it kind of makes a bee polypillar material.

00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:19.480
 And, but if you want to harvest the honey, to not destroy the hive, you would have to

00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:24.840
 go in with a pipette or a syringe and individually sort of go into these little honey pots and take

00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:25.840
 them and take the honey out.

00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:26.840
 That's amazing.

00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:28.200
 You can't harvest it, just a lot more time can see.

00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:31.960
 And I think that people buy it and it's very, very expensive, right?

00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:32.960
 Yeah.

00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:35.960
 I would assume so, because it's so labelled as stingless bee honey.

00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:40.800
 Yeah, and it's been used like for medicine by, you know, indigenous people for hundreds

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:41.800
 of years, I'm sure.

00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:42.800
 Yeah.

00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:45.320
 They use it for, what do they use it for?

00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:49.640
 They use it for, if you've got like a cough, if you've got some flam on your, on your

00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:53.840
 chest, they use it for that, like we would with honey, I suppose, but also for infertility

00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:58.680
 rheumatism, anemia and arthritis, and they make alcohol out of it.

00:47:58.680 --> 00:47:59.680
 Right.

00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:05.780
 And if you want to go and harvest it, according to locals, if on a full moon night you grab

00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:10.800
 a queen bee, squeeze her abdomen and smear the liquid that comes out of it, her onto your

00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:17.000
 eyelids, then you'll be able to temporarily see every bee's nest in the forest in the dark.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:18.000
 Right.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.000
 Right.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:23.240
 If you're ever in the Amazon, that's pretty cool.

00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:24.880
 I'm not sure it's entirely true.

00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:26.760
 I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure I love it though.

00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:27.760
 Sounds legit.

00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:29.680
 And your bees are all gals, do you say?

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:30.680
 Yeah.

00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:35.680
 Well, I mean, because you've got a queen and then all the girls and they're the drones, workers,

00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:36.680
 workers.

00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:41.640
 So all the work bees are female and then she'll keep a couple of lads around, but really

00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:46.160
 their only purpose is to go off and mate with a queen from another hive.

00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:48.200
 So to be honest, the boys don't do anything.

00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:50.120
 They are really very useless.

00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:51.360
 Have you met the boys?

00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:54.960
 You can see them, they're sort of they're much larger, they're quite clumsy, they kind of

00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:57.760
 just daughter about really doing anything, getting in the way.

00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:03.320
 They're the bees, Maddie, the bees, you know what I'm talking about.

00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:04.880
 So yeah, there aren't many.

00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:07.720
 And actually the girls will kick them out, come September.

00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:08.720
 Yeah.

00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:09.720
 They get them out.

00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:10.720
 They're not useful anymore.

00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:11.720
 Where did they go?

00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:12.720
 They die.

00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:13.720
 They're on the floor.

00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:14.720
 Yeah.

00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:19.040
 So it's actually, it's the cleaner bees or the undertaker bees.

00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:22.360
 In fact, they get called, it's their responsibility to take out the dead.

00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:26.600
 So quite often, sort of as you're approaching the winter months, you'll just see just a graveyard

00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:29.880
 of bees in front of the hive, so they've all been taken out just to make sure things are

00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:30.880
 clean for the winter.

00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:31.880
 Yeah.

00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:32.880
 Wow.

00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:35.480
 I've got the case of a goat suing a pig here.

00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:36.480
 Oh yeah.

00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:37.480
 Okay.

00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:38.480
 Yep.

00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:39.480
 Gone.

00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:40.480
 2014.

00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:41.480
 The pig is pepper pig.

00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:42.480
 Oh yeah.

00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:43.480
 And the goat is Gabriela Capra.

00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:44.480
 Oh yes.

00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:45.480
 Capra.

00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:50.440
 Who's name in Italian means Gabriela Goat, and the character in pepper pig called Gabriela

00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:55.520
 Goat, and then the Italian pepper pig, she's Gabriela Capra, and she said, she needed a hundred

00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:57.840
 thousand euros to compensate her because she was annoyed.

00:49:57.840 --> 00:49:58.840
 And use her name.

00:49:58.840 --> 00:49:59.840
 Use her name.

00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:00.840
 Oh right.

00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:02.480
 It doesn't look like she got it.

00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:05.320
 The case goes very, very quiet after a blizzard of publicity.

00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:06.320
 Yeah.

00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:12.280
 But in 2022, the owners of pepper pig themselves sued a Vietnamese firm, which had made a very,

00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:16.680
 very, very similar looking and feeling franchise, called Wolfu.

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:20.080
 So that's three little pigs suing a wolf.

00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:21.080
 Oh.

00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:22.080
 That's good for it.

00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:23.080
 Yeah.

00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:25.080
 I was a family of four in pepper pig, but yeah, that's...

00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:26.080
 Yeah.

00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:27.080
 I don't think the younger kids.

00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:28.080
 Someone says, part of the morsi.

00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:29.080
 I was trying to...

00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:30.080
 Sorry.

00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:31.080
 The pepper is.

00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:33.080
 Oh my god.

00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:34.880
 You're trying to do something.

00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:36.880
 You're trying to do something.

00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:41.800
 I started looking at just generally the rights of other animals, and I couldn't find

00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:46.320
 many examples where animals had been given the equivalent to human rights.

00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:52.040
 There certainly are some that exist, but I was able to find quite a few examples where

00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:57.480
 animals are being protected from humans doing stupid things in Alaska to protect these

00:50:57.480 --> 00:50:59.480
 hibernating bears.

00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:05.600
 The US have enacted a law saying it's completely illegal to wake a bear for a photo, but it is

00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:06.600
 okay to hunt them.

00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:07.600
 Okay.

00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:13.600
 That feels like it's protecting the photographer.

00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:14.600
 Yeah.

00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:15.600
 Yeah, of course, of course.

00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:16.600
 You can't be allowed to shoot a hibernating bear.

00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:17.600
 You would hope so.

00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:19.600
 You would hope that a hibernating bear is protected regardless of...

00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:26.840
 If you're out there right now, listening, as you take aim, for two feet away, grow up, mate.

00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:31.040
 They said it's okay to take a photo selfie with a completely awake bear.

00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:32.040
 Yeah, fine.

00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:33.040
 All right.

00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:34.040
 Actively encouraged.

00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:40.120
 But also in Alaska, not just thinking about the bears here, we're also protecting moose.

00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:42.320
 You are not allowed to push one out of an aeroplane.

00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:44.320
 Just in case you ever had it.

00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:45.320
 You ever considered it.

00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:46.320
 Oh, yeah.

00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:47.320
 Not allowed.

00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:48.320
 I'm police ready to go now.

00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:49.320
 Yeah.

00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:50.320
 Yeah.

00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:51.320
 Yeah.

00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:52.320
 Okay.

00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:53.320
 That's it.

00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:54.320
 That is all of our facts.

00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:57.320
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:51:57.320 --> 00:52:00.320

00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:17.200
 It's incredible.

00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:21.120
 If you've got kids in your life, honestly, it's the place to go.

00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:24.520
 So yeah, you can get to us, by the way, as a group on podcast@ky.com.

00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:25.520
 That's our email.

00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:27.000
 All those emails go to Andy.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:31.960
 We read out the best on Drop Us Align, aka Jewel.

00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:35.800
 And that is part of a clubfish, which is our Patreon Secret Members Club.

00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:40.800
 So if you want to check that out, go to patreon.com/nosuchthingasaffish, lots of fun things going

00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:41.800
 on there.

00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:45.600
 Otherwise, just come back next week because we're going to have another episode for you.

00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:51.160
 Thank you, as ever, to the fish team, Lee and Lee and Ethan Rupert Relia, as well as

00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:53.840
 the larger fish busters in the office here.

00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:55.480
 And we'll see you again next week.

00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:56.480
 Good bye.

00:52:56.480 --> 00:53:06.480
