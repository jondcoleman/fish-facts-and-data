1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
 We don't want that, we don't want that, guess it?

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:16,200
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

3
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,720
 to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,720
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,000
 I'm sitting here with Annotes at Speed, James Harkin, and Andy Murray.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,960
 We're also joined by special guest, Rufus Hound, and once again, we have gathered around

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,240
 the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days in an open-tacular

8
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,240
 order.

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,240
 Here we go.

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,240
 Starting with you, Mr Hound.

11
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,240
 Well done.

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:41,360
 Twice in its history, America has been run by a shepherd.

13
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,360
 Wow.

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,360
 Really?

15
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,360
 That is.

16
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,600
 So we got that fact through, and I have no idea what that means.

17
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,600
 Yes, I could.

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,600
 What does that mean?

19
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,880
 Twice, the resident of the White House, has also been a keeper of sheep.

20
00:00:53,880 --> 00:01:00,200
 The first of them was Thomas Jefferson, who, when he lived on his plantation, had corn

21
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:07,920
 and wheat and tried to rotate them, but found that the soil was rapidly blitzed, essentially.

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,920
 And then realized that sheep were the way forward, that they fertilized the soil.

23
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,160
 They were super animals.

24
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:19,520
 And so when he was president, he actually bought sheep with him to the White House.

25
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,280
 And the ram that he was most pleased with in terms of the sheep that he thought would become

26
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,760
 America's sheep was a shetland ram.

27
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:32,400
 Now, in the early days of America, when we think of the White House, we're obviously thinking

28
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,240
 of something behind layers and layers and layers of security, but it used to be a house

29
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,720
 and you could walk on those grounds.

30
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,800
 So the sheep were in the White House grounds, in the lawn or whatever.

31
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:48,000
 But this ram was incredibly violent.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,760
 There were official letters from William Kew, who states that he was left black and blue

33
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,080
 by this ram.

34
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:59,760
 And in another letter, it transpires that actually a small boy was killed by one of Jefferson's

35
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,760
 rooms.

36
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,760
 No.

37
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,760
 Yeah.

38
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,760
 Oh man.

39
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,760
 Very hard to imagine that happening today.

40
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,760
 Today with the White House.

41
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,760
 But that's true.

42
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,560
 Because I was looking into when George Washington, because obviously he was the first resident

43
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,560
 in the White House.

44
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,000
 And it was exactly like that, like people could just come and go, however they wanted.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,560
 And he had to put a law and that stopped people just wandering in off the street to go, "Hey,

46
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,560
 how's it going?"

47
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,200
 He said that he'd be doing work and people would walk in and just going, "Hey, it's just

48
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,200
 passing.

49
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,200
 Are you going good?

50
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,880
 It seems to be going great."

51
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,880
 Bill Clinton was attacked by a sheep, wasn't he?

52
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,880
 Remember that?

53
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,880
 And we were talking about that early, weren't we?

54
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,880
 Yes.

55
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,880
 And I can't remember when.

56
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,520
 It was just a child and he's ever since been scared of sheep.

57
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,520
 Really?

58
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,520
 Yeah, apparently.

59
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,840
 He said it was the awfulest beating I ever took, but I don't know if that was before

60
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:46,560
 after the whole moniker attack.

61
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:54,960
 The other president was Woodrow Wilson, who, when he declared war on Germany in 1917, the

62
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:59,240
 ground staff, by this point, they were ground staff for the White House.

63
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,080
 And because it was, you know, we are one nation.

64
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:11,480
 He freed them to all join the American military and bought sheep instead because the sheep

65
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,440
 would nibble the grass and it would be a sort of cheap upkeep.

66
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,760
 I mean, they can't sculpt hedges as beautifully as some expensive White House ground staff, can

67
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,760
 they?

68
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,800
 I like, yeah, I read that they were as replacement for all of his garden staff.

69
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,000
 How good are they at planting, you know, a nice bed of roses?

70
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,040
 Yeah, but to be fair, they are definitely much worse.

71
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,040
 In a wall.

72
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,040
 Let's do it.

73
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,040
 A human men.

74
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,040
 Very hard, sheep's thighs.

75
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:46,120
 Did anyone call him Woodrow Wilson at the time?

76
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,120
 They should have done.

77
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,120
 They were known as Wilson's Woolies.

78
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,120
 Oh, no.

79
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,120
 Oh, really?

80
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:58,320
 And the ram of this flock was incredibly well known.

81
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,320
 He was known as...

82
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,320
 Is that old egg?

83
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,320
 Old egg.

84
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,320
 Yes.

85
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,320
 Who...

86
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,320
 Smoked.

87
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,320
 So who...

88
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,320
 Well, who loved tobacco?

89
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:11,880
 And anybody who dropped cigar butts in the White House grounds, he would make a bead line

90
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,880
 from him.

91
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,880
 I don't think he smoked, really.

92
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,880
 No, that was an exaggeration, you're right.

93
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,360
 He was chewing the tobacco, wasn't he?

94
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,360
 Yeah.

95
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,800
 One interesting thing about Woodrow Wilson is he had a stroke in, after the war.

96
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,800
 I think it was in 1919 or 1920.

97
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,440
 And his wife took over the de facto running of the country.

98
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,440
 And she was in charge when the 19th Amendment was passed, which was votes for women.

99
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,440
 Really?

100
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,440
 Yeah, she was officially the president, but she was like de facto president.

101
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,440
 That's amazing.

102
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,440
 Because of that sort of invalidates the whole votes for women thing, doesn't it?

103
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,480
 There wasn't even a man in jobs at the time.

104
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:50,360
 Right, we're going to have to go back and recount all the votes, very calibrate.

105
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,600
 Who was the president who basically died post his inauguration?

106
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
 Oh.

107
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
 Because he did an hour and forty...

108
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,600
 Will you have Henry Harrison?

109
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,600
 Yeah.

110
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,600
 I hadn't heard of that until I read the presidency.

111
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,600
 Did you know about this very first?

112
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,600
 Well, yes.

113
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,400
 He was already ill at his inauguration, but he stood outside for so long that it exacerbated the

114
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,400
 symptom and he can't...

115
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,400
 He should have had a nice woolen jumper, shouldn't he?

116
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,400
 Yes.

117
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,400
 He didn't wear a coat or a hat.

118
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,400
 Did he not?

119
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,400
 He was being...

120
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,400
 I don't know.

121
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,400
 I have no gloves.

122
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,400
 He was trying to show...

123
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,200
 Because there were all these reports that he wasn't strong enough, that he wasn't interesting

124
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,200
 enough, that he didn't do long enough speeches.

125
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:30,960
 I'll show them with my naked 10 hour speech and with the snow.

126
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,600
 I read it as well, because I've just been looking at the presidents at the White House and

127
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,440
 sort of interesting things that they did while they were there, so keeping sheep.

128
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,720
 One, and this isn't properly confirmed, but a lot of people seem to think it's true.

129
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,240
 Grover Cleveland used to piss out the window in the Oval Office.

130
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,640
 Yeah, it used to pop the window up.

131
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,640
 Yeah.

132
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,640
 It's a rumor.

133
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:54,640
 It wouldn't be good when the public were just walking through the grounds at the time.

134
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,640
 When you say it's a rumor...

135
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,640
 Why the sheep yellow?

136
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,640
 What's going on?

137
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,640
 Well, you know that you can find a bright yellow sheep in Devon.

138
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,640
 What?

139
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,640
 I mean, yes.

140
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:10,640
 This one of the things I looked up was about sheep rustling, that actually it's going through

141
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:17,640
 the roof over the last 10 years, sheep rustling, and what do they call it, rural crime, has gone

142
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:23,600
 up to something like 125 percent, and whole flocks have been going missing, but one of the

143
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,640
 things is if you take a flock of any kind of size, you actually need a field to put them

144
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,640
 in.

145
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,640
 You know what I mean?

146
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,640
 You can't just leave them in a lock-up.

147
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,640
 Yeah.

148
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:38,400
 So there must be farms that are basically hiding these sheep, and there's so much open green

149
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,160
 space, you know, where are they?

150
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:46,120
 So farmers have taken to dying their sheep, neon yellow, neon blue, neon pink.

151
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:53,120
 That way, if their flock ever goes missing, and then, you know, five hills away, whatever,

152
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,120
 whatever.

153
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,120
 I just saw a bright pink sheep in Devon.

154
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,120
 This was a news article in Turkey earlier this year.

155
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,120
 There were some Turkish shepherds who were in a field, and they...

156
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,120
 Turkey shepherds.

157
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,120
 Oh, boy.

158
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,120
 Wow.

159
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,040
 They were in a field, and the field was next to a cliff.

160
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,280
 And one of the sheep, there were 1,500 sheep in this field.

161
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,280
 And one of them was off a cliff, and all the other sheep followed.

162
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,280
 So all 1,500 sheep in this village climbed fell off a cliff.

163
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:28,280
 And the first 400 died, but then the next 1,100 survived because they landed on the dead bodies

164
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,280
 of the sheep.

165
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,280
 Oh, my God.

166
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,280
 I mean, I know that the sheep are quite fluffy, but I didn't think they were that fluffy.

167
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,280
 That's something if you landed at speed on the sheep.

168
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,280
 You could be really bad.

169
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,280
 You think so, wouldn't you?

170
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,280
 They're not like clouds, you know.

171
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,280
 But define fluffing.

172
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,280
 Like 400 of them had to die first.

173
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,280
 Yeah, that's true.

174
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,280
 Sure, if you pile 400 hedgehogs off a cliff.

175
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:55,280
 Like, the 401st one's going to basically be landing on meaty squelch.

176
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:03,280
 Meaty squelch does make it sound like a less appealing prospect than the big pull of fluff.

177
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,280
 Yeah, I was a bit ashamed.

178
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,280
 Have we ever mentioned on the podcast the idea that sheep just used to shear themselves?

179
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,280
 What?

180
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,280
 They just used to just want and then got laid down.

181
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,280
 They used to shear each other is what you mean.

182
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:20,280
 No, they used to shed their wool on their own.

183
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,280
 And we've breaded out of them because we've wanted to make it a thing where we could do it when we want.

184
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:30,280
 Well, sheep peeling is going to be a thing in the future where you kind of put a protein into the sheep

185
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,280
 and it makes the wool kind of detach itself.

186
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,280
 And then instead of shearing it, you just kind of peel it off.

187
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,280
 Is that like an apple and if you peel it off, can you throw it in the air?

188
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:43,280
 And whatever lesser shape it lands in, is the initial of who you're going to marry?

189
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,280
 Well, for try other things.

190
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,280
 I mean, I know, e-harmony isn't working for you.

191
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,280
 I've been through so many apples. It's just not working.

192
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,280
 Did they come, do you peel it in one big chunk or...

193
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,280
 Yeah, I think that's the idea, yeah.

194
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:07,280
 Well, maybe you just make a tunnel out of the scratchy side of Velcro and run the sheep on both the other end.

195
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,280
 Fire it through, you just can't, innit?

196
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,280
 What can we get that for us?

197
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:18,280
 So instead of getting your hair cut, you just inject something under your skin

198
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:23,280
 and then you just peel your whole hair off and then it saves time.

199
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,280
 I mean, middle aged men around the world are spending billions of pounds

200
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,280
 front of the exact opposite of the thing you just described.

201
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,280
 Yeah, that's the most redundant invention.

202
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:39,280
 It's something to make men bold, yeah, order now and get these three impotent hills.

203
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:46,280
 Okay, time for back number two and that is Harkin.

204
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:55,280
 Okay, my fact this week is that there is a village in Russia where every single person knows how to tightrope walk.

205
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,280
 Is it just a coincidence, like, they're in a pub one day?

206
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,280
 I was like, you know, I can do this really weird thing.

207
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,280
 Oh my god, me too.

208
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,280
 They can all wiggle their ears or something like that, that'd be good.

209
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:12,280
 This is a village called Sofkuladian and it's in Dagestan, so it's in the south of Russia.

210
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:16,280
 The population is about 400 and everyone knows how to tightrope walk.

211
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,280
 The most popular story of how it happened is that a hundred years ago,

212
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:23,280
 the young men had to go to another village to find girls and to do that,

213
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,280
 they had to go up and down a mountain.

214
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:30,280
 And instead of doing that, they would set up a tightrope walk and then they would do it.

215
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:35,280
 But the most common, most likely explanation is it was just bad weather in the area

216
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,280
 and they needed a fix to get over rivers and things like that.

217
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:43,280
 So they did it when the foot bridges would get washed away, they would use tightrope.

218
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,280
 But what's interesting is you say 400 people there.

219
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:51,280
 I've read the article as well and it's quite depressing because this guy is saying,

220
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:56,280
 he used to have 7,000 people there.

221
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:02,280
 Actually only the first 2,000 died.

222
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:08,280
 Yeah, he's really upset because this was the place for tightrope walking and now it's endangered.

223
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:12,280
 It's an endangered tightrope walking village and he's saying we have no funding.

224
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,280
 So if anyone wants to start a Kickstarter for them, they need money.

225
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,280
 Actually, all the villages in Russia are pretty much empty these days.

226
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,280
 Everybody's gone to the cities and I think there's like, I don't know,

227
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,280
 hundreds of thousands of villages with fewer than the dozen people in them know.

228
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,280
 In Russia.

229
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:32,280
 I have a fact on that, which is that there are 23 villages in the Krasnoyarsk region with only men in them.

230
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,280
 Really?

231
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:38,280
 Yeah, and the article about this from a Russian website says that several have only one resident,

232
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,280
 which I don't know if that makes it a village or not.

233
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,280
 I think that's almost been demoted to a hamlet by that point.

234
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,280
 Just a house, isn't it?

235
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,280
 Weirdly, in all of those villages, top gear.

236
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:55,280
 Absolutely correct.

237
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,280
 But the opposite of that, you said that's a town full of men, right?

238
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:05,280
 There's a town of only ladies in Brazil could noiva de Cordereo, I can't say it properly.

239
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,280
 But it's about 600 women in this town.

240
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:12,280
 And the reason it's only women is that the men go away during the weekdays and they work

241
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,280
 and they only come back on the weekends.

242
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:18,280
 And as soon as you hit 18 as a boy and you become a man, you have to leave the village.

243
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,280
 So it's an entire town full of ladies.

244
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,280
 And it's been advertised as like single ladies looking.

245
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:29,280
 So he's suggesting we maybe build a tightrope between Andes all male village and your female village.

246
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,280
 Yeah, that's a long walk.

247
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:35,280
 You've really earned your woman at the end of the day.

248
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:41,280
 I mean, it's a long way, but it is a straight line.

249
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,280
 This is just a village fact.

250
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:51,280
 There's this little village in Kazakhstan called Kalachi, where this sickness has just like afflicted the quarter of the population,

251
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,280
 which is a sleeping sickness, where people keep inexplicably falling into brief comers.

252
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,280
 So people keep on just falling asleep.

253
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,280
 They have complete memory loss.

254
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,280
 They're left with kind of dizziness, nausea, headaches.

255
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,280
 And no one knows what it is.

256
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,280
 They just keep asking how it's narrow uranium plants.

257
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:12,280
 So people are like, "What about that?" But apart from that, it's completely normal little village.

258
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:18,280
 No explanation for these very sleepy people and these very bright yellow sheep.

259
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:25,280
 I was looking into, because I love that idea of everyone in the village does a thing.

260
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:30,280
 So I started looking into villages and towns where everyone does that one thing.

261
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,280
 And I found a couple.

262
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:41,280
 So one is that, this is quite nice. There's a town in Spain, which is there's only 318 residents, and they've all been scanned as 3D models.

263
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,280
 Every resident is a 3D toy now.

264
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:49,280
 And you can go and look at the town of all the people living there just as 3D models, which is quite cool.

265
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,280
 There's a really good one, which was in Jakarta, an entire town.

266
00:13:53,280 --> 00:14:01,280
 Basically, the police took and decided to burn 3.3 tons of marijuana, because they were like, "We're going to be taking this away."

267
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:05,280
 They got an entire village high, the wind blew the smoke.

268
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,280
 And so this entire village would just off their heads for ages.

269
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:17,280
 Have you seen that video of the BBC reporter trying to do the link mix of the pile of burning heroin?

270
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,280
 Wow!

271
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:22,280
 I'm in Google it now. Pause this podcast and go look at it.

272
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:26,280
 He literally cannot hold it together past the first four words.

273
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:30,280
 I think the exceptional reporting is so good.

274
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,280
 Some stuff on tightrope.

275
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,280
 Yes, yeah.

276
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,280
 Why not?

277
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:42,280
 In 5th century France, the tightrope walkers were forbidden to go near churches for some reason.

278
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,280
 Was it in case they set up a line?

279
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:48,280
 Because some people did go from Notre Dame's to towers between them.

280
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,280
 That was a big thing in France.

281
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:54,280
 No, it was mostly like the church used to look down on actors as well.

282
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,280
 You can't look down on a tightrope walker.

283
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,280
 Well, they're doing it wrong.

284
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:06,280
 But the thing is that all the fares were held near churches, and the fares were the places where the tightrope walkers did their thing.

285
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:11,280
 So basically, it was a ban on all of tightrope walking in the 5th century France.

286
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:15,280
 Didn't work. Did it? We've still got it today. Yes.

287
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,280
 Does anyone else find it really surprising that it was only...

288
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:23,280
 Was it last year or the year before that someone walked on a tightrope across the Grand Canyon?

289
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,280
 It seemed like the most obvious thing you'd do.

290
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:25,280
 Oh, yeah.

291
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,280
 And then Knicksick or London was the fares.

292
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,280
 It's so obvious.

293
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,280
 It's so obvious.

294
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:35,280
 I like the fact that they had to put a 10-second delay that was shown live,

295
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,280
 except that there was a 10-second delay on the footage wasn't there.

296
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,280
 In case it felt.

297
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,280
 In case something happened. So I mean, I don't know what they would have done.

298
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,280
 I guess they just black out the programme and go, "Well, that's done."

299
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,280
 Up to the next.

300
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,280
 So Nick Wellender is a very, very famous tightrope walker.

301
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:53,280
 But you know he's from a family dating back generations of tightrope walkers.

302
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:59,280
 So the Wellender's Carl Wellender was one of the most famous, but he was going in the 1920s.

303
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,280
 And he set up the...

304
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:05,280
 One of the hardest things to do is a human pyramid on a tightrope, unsurprisingly.

305
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,280
 So you have two walkers on a rope, one in front of the other.

306
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:12,280
 They have a bar on their shoulders, and you have a third walker on the bar.

307
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,280
 Wow.

308
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,280
 It gets even better.

309
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:20,280
 The Wellender family did a seven-person pyramid.

310
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,280
 Right? So you have four men at the bottom going in pairs.

311
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,280
 There are two lines. So you've got a square.

312
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,280
 They both have a bar on each of them.

313
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,280
 And there are two men on the next level up on each of those bars.

314
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:38,280
 Those two men have a chair between them on their shoulders, and a woman is standing on the chair or sitting on the chair.

315
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,280
 Right.

316
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,280
 And they did this for decades without incident.

317
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:46,280
 And then in 1962, they did have an accident, and two of them fell and died, and one of them fell and was paralyzed.

318
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,280
 And the other four managed to cling onto the rope.

319
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,280
 Of the Wellenders?

320
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,280
 Yeah, of the Wellenders.

321
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,280
 They lost two Wellenders.

322
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,280
 Yeah, they were a family.

323
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,280
 Yeah, they did that.

324
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:58,280
 What I like about tightrope is how basically they just make it as difficult as possible.

325
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:04,280
 And then in this human pyramid or going over a line cage, it's just like it's not enough that you're walking from one place to another.

326
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,280
 You have to do something done.

327
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,280
 On the Lions.

328
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,280
 Oh, yeah.

329
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:15,280
 Blondon, who was one of the great tightrope walkers ever, he once did a tightrope walk with a lion cub in a wheelbarrow.

330
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,280
 So he combined the lion and the tightrope.

331
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,280
 Wow.

332
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:23,280
 But that was very dangerous, and he very nearly fell and died, because it was, line cubs are not light.

333
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,280
 Yeah.

334
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:31,280
 And there are wheelbarrows, and it, obviously the line, you know, will bend a bit or it'll dip in the middle because you've got a wheelbarrow and a line.

335
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:39,280
 What you want to have is a wheelbarrow with two giraffes in it, with the next sticking out either way.

336
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:45,280
 Okay, I found someone called William Leonard Hunt, who performed under the state name, The Great Farini.

337
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:52,280
 One of his best ever tricks, this was in 1860, was crossing Niagara Falls with a washing machine tied to his back.

338
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:57,280
 And I don't know what that would have looked like, because in 1860 they didn't have modern washing machine.

339
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,280
 It wouldn't have been a massive one, like we have, but in the middle he stopped to wash several handkerchiefs.

340
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,280
 And then when he got to the other side, he gave them to, you know, his admirers.

341
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,280
 I don't know, it feels like washing machines would have been bigger in those days.

342
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:12,280
 Like those massive ones, which you open at the top and you shovel your stuff.

343
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,280
 Yeah.

344
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,280
 Like, hang on.

345
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,280
 Surely it was just like a bucket to the mangoes.

346
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:27,280
 I think your idea of what these wash machines are doing is like, they're only one step up from the Flintstones.

347
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,280
 It's herodactyl with a mouthful of soap.

348
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:37,280
 Is this the same guy, or is it Blondon, who did the type of walk over Niagara, where?

349
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,280
 That was Blondon.

350
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,280
 Is it Blondon?

351
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:45,280
 So he went over with his son, strapped to him at one point, within manager, giving his manager a piggyback.

352
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:50,280
 I wrote a report where they said that they didn't like the safety side of that, because someone else could get hurt.

353
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,280
 So could he instead cook an omelette when he goes out on the stove?

354
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,280
 It needs to be.

355
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,280
 Which he did, yeah.

356
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,280
 But how did he cook it?

357
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,280
 How did he make that suggestion?

358
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,280
 He had a little stove.

359
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,280
 He had a miniature stove, and he had a pan.

360
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,280
 And to be fair, he didn't just fry an egg or something.

361
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,280
 He went omelette.

362
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,280
 Oh, I can't stop.

363
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,280
 Yeah.

364
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:10,280
 Chopped a few china chives, yeah.

365
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:15,280
 Oh, needs cumin, had to go back.

366
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,280
 Yeah, so it's only a little stove.

367
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,280
 It's not like an hour ago.

368
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,280
 He was carrying on his back.

369
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,280
 No, it took a full kitchen.

370
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:26,280
 So Nick Wollenders says he refuses to use safety nets.

371
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,280
 He never has done.

372
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,280
 He's had to once, because he had to buy lots when he was going over Niagara Falls, I think.

373
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:35,280
 And he says, my great-grandfather taught that safety nets offer a full sense of security.

374
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,280
 So I never used them.

375
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,280
 I mean, how full is that sense of security?

376
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,280
 I don't see.

377
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,280
 Are they just an illusion of safety nets?

378
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,280
 Well, no, but I met Philip Petit once years ago.

379
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,280
 Philip Petit was the guy who walked the twin towers.

380
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,280
 Oh, wow.

381
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,280
 If you've seen, yeah, man on wire, that documentary.

382
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:58,280
 And so he came, the QI used to have a building in Oxford, and he came and did a book signing there.

383
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,280
 So he arrived.

384
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,280
 Do you know what?

385
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,280
 He starts all of his features on the top of the ladder.

386
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,280
 So he came and he was like, do you have a ladder?

387
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,280
 So we got him a ladder.

388
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:10,280
 And so as everyone came in, he was just perched at the top of the ladder.

389
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:15,280
 And someone asked him in the Q&A section, at any point when you were walking between the twin towers,

390
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,280
 did you think, oh my god, I'm going to fall?

391
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,280
 And he got furious at them.

392
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,280
 He said he doesn't acknowledge the idea of falling.

393
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:24,280
 He said that just, you would never do it if that was even thought to be a possibility.

394
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,280
 And then he said, and if I did fall, I would fly.

395
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,280
 I thought, hmm.

396
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,280
 Okay.

397
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:39,280
 There's a pin-line between confidence and mental instability.

398
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,280
 Time for fact, number three, and that is Chazinsky.

399
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,280
 My fight is that in Britain, pedestrians step to the right to avoid each other.

400
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,280
 And in Japan, they step to the left.

401
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,280
 And nobody knows why.

402
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,280
 It's just weird.

403
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,280
 So it's totally, yeah.

404
00:20:53,280 --> 00:21:02,280
 So it actually is like every country has pedestrians tend to have a strong preference for stepping to a certain side when they're about to walk into another pedestrian.

405
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:09,280
 But it bears no relation to what side of the road they drive on or what side of the road you're supposed to walk on.

406
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,280
 Because in Japan, the drive on the left as well.

407
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,280
 So you would expect it to be the same way.

408
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,280
 Yeah.

409
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,280
 So you can get really obsessed, as I did, with pedestrian behaviour.

410
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:22,280
 And I really do recommend reading the thousands of reports that have been put out, mainly by the two same guys.

411
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:28,280
 So for instance, we act differently if we are going to collide with someone on a staircase.

412
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:34,280
 So when we're walking along a pavement, we tend to only put into action avoidance behaviour when we're about a metre away.

413
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:38,280
 But if people meet on a staircase, they do it right at the start of the staircase.

414
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,280
 So you see someone right at the bottom and you decide there.

415
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,280
 Okay, I'm going to step to the right now to avoid them.

416
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:48,280
 So Richard Wiseman did a study about how quickly people walk in cities.

417
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:56,280
 And he asked people to send him data and whatever. And he found that the fastest city in the world for people walking 20 yards is Singapore.

418
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:02,280
 And they, on average, walk at 10 seconds, 10.55 seconds to walk 20 yards.

419
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,280
 Copenhagen was next. London was about halfway down.

420
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,280
 It takes about 12.17 seconds to walk 20 yards.

421
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:15,280
 And everyone's between about 10 and 17 seconds, apart from one place called Blantire in Malawi.

422
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,280
 I've been there.

423
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,280
 Have you?

424
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:23,280
 I walk at 31.6 seconds per 20 yards, which is more than twice as much as anyone else.

425
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,280
 Oh my god.

426
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,280
 It's just like really like very pedestrian.

427
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,280
 Did you notice that?

428
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,280
 Did you notice that?

429
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,280
 So I went on Wikipedia to see what reason there could be behind that.

430
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:37,280
 And it says the most conspicuous and dominant physical feature of the city is a numerous hills.

431
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,280
 So it could be that.

432
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,280
 Oh, yeah.

433
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,280
 They're walking up.

434
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:48,280
 So surely that would average out.

435
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,280
 Just with things going right and left.

436
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:55,280
 I read a thing and actually, Rufus, you might know more about this because you've done a lot of stage acting.

437
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,280
 Villains exit stage left.

438
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,280
 Yes.

439
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,280
 Is that a true thing?

440
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,280
 It's in Pantamine.

441
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,280
 Okay.

442
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,280
 More than in sort of all theatre.

443
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:08,280
 But yeah, obviously the Latin for left was sinister.

444
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:12,280
 And so that's where we get things on the left being sinister.

445
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,280
 Oh really?

446
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,280
 Yeah, all Pantamine Villains exit stage left and the goodies exit stage right.

447
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,280
 Or enter and exit stage left and right.

448
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,280
 So is that how you spot the villain in a pantomime?

449
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,280
 Because I've never been quite sure.

450
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,280
 They're very subtle about that.

451
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,280
 Yeah, it's fine by that.

452
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,280
 Those are the clues you're looking for.

453
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,280
 You're always leaving pantomimes going.

454
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,280
 I liked it.

455
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:34,280
 I thought it was very powerful and ambiguous.

456
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:39,280
 But yeah, so I read that even Hershey with Tintin, he used to do that as well.

457
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:44,280
 If you would face a certain way, so you would face right if you were progressing as a character.

458
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:47,280
 And then you would face left if things were suddenly going against you.

459
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,280
 Yeah.

460
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,280
 Didn't we do something about cowboy films?

461
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,280
 Yeah, we did.

462
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:56,280
 That the good guys go from left to right, I think, on the screen.

463
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,280
 And really, this is in really early cowboy films, which is mostly, you know, it's...

464
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,280
 Yeah.

465
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:05,280
 And also usually the bad guy dresses in black, I think, and the bad guy dresses in white.

466
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,280
 That would have been a technical thing, wouldn't it?

467
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,280
 And like a cultural thing that in black and white.

468
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:17,280
 Have you seen the old makeup that film actresses used to wear in black and white movies?

469
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,280
 Oh, I think so.

470
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,280
 So they had like green paint on their faces.

471
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:24,280
 And then the lips were like bright blue.

472
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:33,280
 Because the way it registered on old chromatic black and white film was that it looked most likely to be red and...

473
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,280
 And things were registered in that way.

474
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,280
 That must have been so hard to act.

475
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,280
 Is that why they're all a little bit less believable in black and white films?

476
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:44,280
 As long as Olivia is looking at someone like fluorescent face.

477
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,280
 Wow.

478
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,280
 Darling, I love you very much.

479
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,280
 You look ridiculous.

480
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:55,280
 I read horses, apparently, are better at running if you have a race horse.

481
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:59,280
 It depends over the distance.

482
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,280
 There is an annual man-v-horse race.

483
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,280
 In Wales, isn't it?

484
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,280
 Yeah.

485
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,280
 And we kill it over the ten-yard dash.

486
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,280
 We kill it, well then, obviously we win.

487
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:13,280
 The way that that works is it's over.

488
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,280
 It's round lots of tight corners, isn't it?

489
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,280
 So the horse struggles to get round those.

490
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,280
 And there are bits of up and down.

491
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,280
 It's done in a way that makes it almost equal between human and horse.

492
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,280
 It's quite exciting.

493
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,280
 So is it always been a human win?

494
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,280
 No, the human win.

495
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,280
 For the first time quite about four or five years ago.

496
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,280
 I think it's generally the horse that wins.

497
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,280
 Yeah.

498
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:37,280
 But yeah, apparently if they go one way around a racetrack, is an advantage to most horses.

499
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,280
 If you suddenly sent them around the other way.

500
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,280
 Oh, really?

501
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,280
 Because yeah, there's something about being right foot to being.

502
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,280
 Of course, it's a right foot to be.

503
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,280
 You learn like anyone knows if you've ridden that you, when you go into a canter,

504
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,280
 you have to get it on its right leg.

505
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,280
 So you have to, when you're trotting and you go into a canter,

506
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,280
 you have to sit down at the right moment.

507
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,280
 Otherwise, you're on its wrong leg because they're right most of the right footed.

508
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,280
 And you can tell it feels wrong if you sit down at the wrong time.

509
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,280
 You can feel that it's really awkward.

510
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,280
 Very weirdly looking into pedestrian behaviour for this,

511
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,280
 I found an article on the Chicago Tribune website which said,

512
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:11,280
 "In Britain simply stepping off a curb means pedestrians walk a tightrope."

513
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,280
 Not very interesting, but true.

514
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,280
 Good link.

515
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:18,280
 Well, if we're doing sort of pavement style behaviour,

516
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:22,280
 do you know why French actors say "melt" to each other?

517
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,280
 No.

518
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,280
 So we say "break a leg."

519
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,280
 Do you know what "break a leg" means?

520
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,280
 No.

521
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:31,280
 So the levers that lift the front curtain up and down,

522
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,280
 they're actually called legs.

523
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:36,280
 And so if you've got lots and lots of standing ovations

524
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,280
 and the curtain had to come up and down on them,

525
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,280
 you would break a leg.

526
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,280
 So when actors wish each other "break a leg" that's where that comes from.

527
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:50,280
 But French actors say "melt" because if your run was going to be incredibly long,

528
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:53,280
 if the play was going to be a huge success,

529
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,280
 then you would have lots of people coming into the theatre.

530
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,280
 And before there were pavements, the reason that we have pavements

531
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:03,280
 was that the horses would go in the road and that's where all the poo would go.

532
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,280
 And the pedestrians could walk on the pavement.

533
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,280
 And that was a raised thing to send us off from the poo.

534
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,280
 But before that, you were just trampling in poo all the time.

535
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,280
 So if your play ran for a long time,

536
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,280
 people would be treading poo into the theatre.

537
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:20,280
 So French actors wish each other "melt" meaning dragging a lot of...

538
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,280
 I hope the theatre is full of shit.

539
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,280
 It's so great.

540
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,280
 Who came up with, like, they must have had an actor's meeting

541
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,280
 the last thing about three hours going,

542
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,280
 well, the processes and the horses are outside for ages,

543
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:35,280
 and so they poo and then we'll...

544
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,280
 Probably I doubt there was a meeting.

545
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,280
 There wasn't a meeting.

546
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,280
 Someone in Cabernet said, "Okay, there's news from England.

547
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,280
 They've got this new breaker leg thing.

548
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,280
 We need to get on to this now."

549
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:47,280
 So they did experiments on, again, on pedestrians

550
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,280
 and seeing what distracts people.

551
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:53,280
 And they gathered up test walkers, as they called them,

552
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,280
 into a virtual street crossing simulator,

553
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,280
 which I really like.

554
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,280
 And they pumped in the noise of traffic through speakers.

555
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,280
 And they measured how well these people crossed a virtual road

556
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,280
 while having a phone conversation.

557
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,280
 Because obviously you don't want to test it in the real world

558
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,280
 with actual traffic, so fair enough.

559
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,280
 But it was a real phone call, so they were speaking to one of the scientists.

560
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:16,280
 And they did look both ways when they were crossing this virtual road.

561
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,280
 But they still were walking much more dangerously,

562
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,280
 so they had less time to spare.

563
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,280
 They missed more chances to cross safely

564
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,280
 and they had more close calls.

565
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,280
 And I love this.

566
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:30,280
 Some even got hit by a virtual car.

567
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,280
 We're just kind of the best car to be hit by, but still.

568
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:36,280
 And it basically, they compared it with doing other things.

569
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,280
 So listening to music seems to distract people much less,

570
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,280
 maybe because it's a song you know, I don't know,

571
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,280
 or maybe just because you don't know what the other person will say.

572
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,280
 But also, it's as distracting to talk on your mobile phone

573
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,280
 as it is to do complicated mental arithmetic

574
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,280
 while you're crossing the road.

575
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,280
 Right.

576
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,280
 They have the same effect on your cognitive ability.

577
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:57,280
 But this is why they banned being on the phone while you're driving,

578
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:01,280
 like holding the phone to your ear, things like that, wasn't it?

579
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:05,280
 Because largely it seems that your brain processes language,

580
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:11,280
 like the way in which your brain processes language interferes

581
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:15,280
 with your other processes in a way that listen to music doesn't.

582
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,280
 Which is why, if you're studying,

583
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,280
 but you want music on at the same time,

584
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,280
 you should listen to classical musical dance music

585
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:26,280
 without a vocal, because the moment there's a vocal,

586
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:29,280
 your brain processes get infused.

587
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:34,280
 In Chongqing, in China, they've now got a cell phone lane on pavements

588
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,280
 so that people who are using their phones go in that lane.

589
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,280
 So I guess at least they just bump into each other.

590
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,280
 Wow.

591
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:43,280
 Some theatres in Broadway now have a cell phone section of seating

592
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:47,280
 so that you can tweak and look at Facebook while the show is on.

593
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,280
 That makes so much sense.

594
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,280
 No, it doesn't.

595
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,280
 No, it does not.

596
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:55,280
 Wow, I mean, it's a borne, if you're a sort of pure theatre,

597
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,280
 go about that stage, yeah.

598
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:01,280
 But actually, there are some suggestions that producers are quite keen on this

599
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:06,280
 because people do spend time, it turns out, tweeting about how much they're enjoying the show

600
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,280
 and it's bars and things like that.

601
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:10,280
 So they've got roped off sort of sections that, you know.

602
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,280
 I'm into this.

603
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,280
 I'm very into it.

604
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,280
 I don't want to sound I'll kick and with Andy on this, but that's that.

605
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,280
 That is disgusting.

606
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,280
 The last thing anybody would want me with Andy on there.

607
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:30,280
 Okay, time for our final fact of the show and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

608
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:37,280
 My fact is that half of all California condors were raised by glove puppets.

609
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:43,280
 So condors are massive birds and it's sort of 10 feet wingspanes

610
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,280
 and they evolved millions and millions of years ago.

611
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,280
 They're fantastic things.

612
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:54,280
 They can fly 100 miles a day looking for food, but they were not very well suited to the 20th century.

613
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,280
 They were shot a lot and they would fly into power lines and things like that.

614
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:01,280
 And in 1987, there were just 22 left of these birds.

615
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,280
 And they were all taken into captivity.

616
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,280
 They were rounded up because they just weren't safe.

617
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,280
 They couldn't be guaranteed that they'd survive.

618
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:12,280
 And they were bred in zoos and they were bred by puppets.

619
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,280
 So why?

620
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:19,280
 Well, the good thing about condors is that when they lay an egg, if you take the egg away,

621
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,280
 they assume that the egg has smashed on the ground or that it's not survived somehow.

622
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,280
 And so they will be able to lay another one within that breeding season.

623
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:29,280
 And if you do that again, they'll lay another one the next breeding season quite quickly.

624
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,280
 So basically you can quadruple the number of eggs that they lay.

625
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:35,280
 They'll really twist them off in the process.

626
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:42,280
 They will annoy them, but three eggs that humans can raise and you'll have the fourth egg which the condor parents can raise.

627
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,280
 So that's what they did.

628
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,280
 They took the three eggs, they incubated them.

629
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,280
 And when they were born, they made leather glove puppets.

630
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,280
 And you have to look them up, the pictures are incredible.

631
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,280
 I'll put them on my Twitter.

632
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:58,280
 And it's really weird seeing them interacting with also puppet-looking baby condors.

633
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,280
 Which don't they look really rubbery and strange and odd.

634
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:06,280
 And they drowned out the noise by playing the sounds of rivers and streams.

635
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,280
 And they poked the puppets through a one-way screen.

636
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,280
 So you couldn't see the human behind.

637
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:17,280
 One of the people who cares for them, this guy, I think, a quote from a guy called Ron Webb,

638
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:23,280
 who's a senior condor keeper, explained that he raises these baby condors with the help of a condor hand puppet.

639
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:27,280
 And then he goes on to say, "The puppet is like a fancy glove."

640
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:33,280
 Who ever needs an explanation for what hand puppet is.

641
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,280
 I love a good one.

642
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,280
 It is a fancy glove, isn't it?

643
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,280
 It's not like I go to the ball wearing this.

644
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:45,280
 Well, Contessa, your city is looking especially delightful this evening.

645
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:50,280
 Hey, speaking of city, I looked into city because I was just going into the glove puppet territory.

646
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,280
 Do you know how city came about?

647
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,280
 Does anyone know the origin story?

648
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:57,280
 It was a hit bitten by a radio actor.

649
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,280
 Wasn't it a gift?

650
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:04,280
 No, so a reality show on the BBC called BBC's Talent Night.

651
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:07,280
 Effectively, Britain's got talent back in the 1950s.

652
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:11,280
 And on that show stood a man with the city puppet.

653
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,280
 And he just, I don't even know what he did.

654
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,280
 When that have been Harry Corbett.

655
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,280
 Harry Corbett, yeah.

656
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,280
 So Harry Corbett went on, he had Sutty.

657
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,280
 That's what made it through the heat.

658
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,280
 Yeah, he made it to the final.

659
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,280
 Sutty is a reality TV star.

660
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,280
 He's effectively the Susan Boyle of his time.

661
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,280
 He's a, like, he's a...

662
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,280
 He got voted.

663
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,280
 That was his actor with Sutty singing.

664
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,280
 I dreamed a dream.

665
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,280
 Yeah.

666
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,280
 But into Harry Corbett's here.

667
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:35,280
 I've met Matthew Corbett.

668
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,280
 Matthew Corbett's son worked on QI.

669
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,280
 Yeah, thank Corbett.

670
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,280
 Thank Corbett worked on QI.

671
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,280
 He's our sound technician, QI.

672
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,280
 Yeah.

673
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,280
 Ironically, given his family trade.

674
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,280
 He was involved in helping to amplify people.

675
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,280
 Well, that's arguably what the apparently...

676
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,280
 Yes.

677
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,280
 What's that you say, Sutty?

678
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,280
 Oh, yeah.

679
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,280
 Yeah.

680
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,280
 So it's just carrying...

681
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,280
 Oh, that's...

682
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,280
 I like that.

683
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,280
 And he listens, by the way.

684
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,280
 Oh, hello, Ben.

685
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,280
 Hey, Ben.

686
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,280
 They're away.

687
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,280
 That's so cool.

688
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,280
 So Condos.

689
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,280
 So the thing is all the...

690
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:08,280
 All the condos which have been raised by these puppets.

691
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,280
 They started behaving really weirdly.

692
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,280
 So instead of staying in the wild and doing condos stuff.

693
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,280
 They started posing for photos with...

694
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,280
 I mean, not posing, but, you know...

695
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,280
 They started completely being in photos with people.

696
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,280
 They started attacking hikers shoelaces.

697
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,280
 And they also started experimenting with group sex.

698
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,280
 Which is not normal condo behavior, I believe.

699
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,280
 Hey, who are you to judge?

700
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,280
 Oh, yeah.

701
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,280
 Normal.

702
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,280
 Sure.

703
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,280
 She's got only herself around that.

704
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:40,280
 So the theory was because they hadn't been raised by wild birds.

705
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,280
 That they didn't have proper role models for how to behave like a condo.

706
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,280
 But the puppets...

707
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,280
 The cranes, because they've also done it with cranes.

708
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,280
 And when they did the puppet reading with cranes.

709
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:54,280
 The puppet read cranes would often abandon their eggs days before they were due to hatch.

710
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,280
 But really, really not long before.

711
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,280
 So they just didn't have any idea of how to bring up...

712
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,280
 A check, the same way.

713
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:08,280
 So to fix this situation, the humans had to start behaving like condos with these glove puppets.

714
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,280
 So that's when they showed them the screens.

715
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,280
 But also they would sort of...

716
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,280
 They would...

717
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,280
 This isn't nice, but they had to sort of hit the child condos a bit, the checks.

718
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,280
 When they miss behave.

719
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,280
 That must be the weirdest thing slapping a condor.

720
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,280
 And being paid, being paid to do that.

721
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:25,280
 Because that's not a voluntary job, you know.

722
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,280
 Can I explain a rabbit hole that I went down looking at the...

723
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,280
 Yes, of course.

724
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,280
 ...was that the California condor went extinct in the world in 1987.

725
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,280
 So I was like, oh, let's see what else went extinct in 1987.

726
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,280
 Oh, cool.

727
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,280
 And that led me to discover that there's this thing called de-extinction,

728
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,280
 which is the attempt to bring back...

729
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,280
 That Jurassic Park.

730
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,280
 Like Jurassic Park, essentially, to bring back extinct species.

731
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:52,280
 And this year was the fifth generation of the Quagga.

732
00:35:52,280 --> 00:36:00,280
 And the Quagga is a specifically patterned zebra, which had gone extinct.

733
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:03,280
 And Quagga became a slang term just to mean all zebras.

734
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:10,280
 So the last Quagga, that genuine Quagga, died in 1883 in a zoo.

735
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,280
 But nobody realised she was the last of her kind.

736
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,280
 And then it was realised that it wasn't a specific species,

737
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,280
 as much as a subspecies.

738
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:28,280
 So you could selectively breed plain zebras to have the same markings and elements as a Quagga.

739
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,280
 And they've done that successfully.

740
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,280
 And now the fifth generation of Quagga has been reborn.

741
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,280
 And then I found a list of likely candidates for de-extinction.

742
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:44,280
 So there's the Carolina parakeet, the passenger pigeon, which is the most common pigeon in America.

743
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:48,280
 And was largely just like if they saw one they'd shoot it for a love.

744
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,280
 That went the woolly mammoth.

745
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,280
 I think we've all been expecting that for a while now.

746
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,280
 And the thing that I had no idea even ever existed,

747
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,280
 when extinct 10,000 years ago, the woolly rhino.

748
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,280
 Oh, that sounds really cool.

749
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,280
 Doesn't it?

750
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,280
 Yeah.

751
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,280
 Should have found those.

752
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,280
 Oh, yeah.

753
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,280
 Just heal a rhino.

754
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,280
 Yeah.

755
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,280
 It would have been very hot, though, wouldn't it?

756
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,280
 It would have been hot.

757
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,280
 Is that what made it extinct?

758
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,280
 It's just too hot.

759
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,280
 What's the use?

760
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:26,280
 So one thing about surrogates is for giant pandas, they sometimes use rabbits.

761
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:31,280
 So they'll put the giant panda clone eggs inside a rabbit.

762
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,280
 Oh, really?

763
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,280
 So the rabbit could give birth to a panda and they're like, oh my god.

764
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:38,280
 That's going to be one braggie rabbit mom at the school gates, isn't it?

765
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,280
 And also--

766
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,280
 That's my boy.

767
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,280
 I'm not a rabbit.

768
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,280
 Because they look-- they're tiny and gross at first, aren't they?

769
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:48,280
 So it'll give birth at first, and it's like a two-millimeter tall lump of skin

770
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,280
 and the other rabbits are going to take the piss.

771
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,280
 It's like a new version of the ugly--

772
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,280
 The ugly duckling.

773
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,280
 Yeah.

774
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,280
 The giant panda.

775
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,280
 Yeah.

776
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,280
 Speaking of--

777
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,280
 It once was a hideous rabbit.

778
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,280
 Yeah.

779
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,280
 With ears, all stubby and short.

780
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,280
 And all the other bunnies and so many words said,

781
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,280
 bloody hell, you're wearing a lot of bamboo.

782
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:11,280
 Oh my god.

783
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,280
 Just back to condors very quickly.

784
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,280
 They don't eat for days because they fly and they obviously go for huge meals.

785
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,280
 So they'll look for the carcass of a deer or whatever.

786
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:22,280
 And when they do eat, sometimes they go overboard on it, eat too much

787
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,280
 that they can't actually take off again.

788
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,280
 Yeah.

789
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,280
 So that's true?

790
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,280
 That's how they used to catch them in like South America and stuff.

791
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,280
 They would put like a dead horse or something on the ground or a dead animal.

792
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:38,280
 And then the condors would come down and they'd eat so much that they couldn't eat anymore.

793
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,280
 And then they won't be able to fly because they were so happy.

794
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:44,280
 And then you just sort of run after them and rather than the noose and then pull them off.

795
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:50,280
 And often, like they try and fly and they throw up because they were so exhausted and so full.

796
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,280
 Is that an evolutionary response?

797
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:59,280
 Because the reason that we want to we when we get nervous is supposedly because there's a--

798
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:05,280
 I think a reptile, you know, so the evolution of the brain is that we start off with a very simple brain

799
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:10,280
 and then we get a bit of the brain that becomes like reptilian and then it becomes mammalian.

800
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,280
 And it's basically layer on layer.

801
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:17,280
 And the reason we want to we when we get nervous is you want to make yourself as light as possible

802
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,280
 so that when you start to run away, you can get further.

803
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,280
 I would think that would probably be the time of the condol, wouldn't it?

804
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:28,280
 That you throw up because you want to then you'd be lighter and then you could arguably get away.

805
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:34,280
 Oh, there's some animals that throw up so that something chasing them will eat whatever they've thrown up instead of eating them.

806
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,280
 Diversionary vomit.

807
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:43,280
 So when eating corpses, condos always start with that eyes and tongue which is their favourite part.

808
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:48,280
 You don't know that, it might be their least favourite part and they're just getting it over with.

809
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,280
 That's so true.

810
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,280
 You eat your eyes and tongue young lady.

811
00:39:51,280 --> 00:40:00,280
 Oh, come on, it's just in the heart.

812
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,280
 There is a reddit thread.

813
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:07,280
 Do you prefer sex with or without a condor, which is a typo?

814
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,280
 That's the best typo.

815
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,280
 Did anyone reply?

816
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,280
 Lots of people have replied.

817
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,280
 Yeah, but with.

818
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,280
 Love it.

819
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:19,280
 Okay, that's it.

820
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,280
 That's all of our facts.

821
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,280
 Thank you so much for listening.

822
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:26,280

 I've just always wanted her to say that.

832
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,280
 I was into every episode.

833
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,280
 No, I've got email.

834
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,280
 It's like, come on.

835
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,280
 Join the Twitter.

836
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:45,280
 Just for the neatness of this wrapper.

837
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,280
 Yeah.

838
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,280
 It's not allowed.

839
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,280
 It's in my contract.

840
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,280
 It's a thing now.

841
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,280
 Yeah.

842
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,280
 In which case, you could probably find me at Rufus.

843
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,280
 Yep.

844
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,280
 And Juzinsky.

845
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,280
 You can email podcast@QI.com.

846
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,280
 And we'll be back again next week with another episode of No Such Things and Fish.

847
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,280
 See you then.

848
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,280
 Good bye.
