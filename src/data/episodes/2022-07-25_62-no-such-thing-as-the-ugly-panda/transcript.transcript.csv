00:00:00,00:00:05,"We don't want that, we don't want that, guess it?"
00:00:05,00:00:16,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:16,00:00:18,to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.
00:00:18,00:00:19,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:19,00:00:23,"I'm sitting here with Annotes at Speed, James Harkin, and Andy Murray."
00:00:23,00:00:26,"We're also joined by special guest, Rufus Hound, and once again, we have gathered around"
00:00:26,00:00:31,the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days in an open-tacular
00:00:31,00:00:32,order.
00:00:32,00:00:33,Here we go.
00:00:33,00:00:35,"Starting with you, Mr Hound."
00:00:35,00:00:36,Well done.
00:00:36,00:00:41,"Twice in its history, America has been run by a shepherd."
00:00:41,00:00:42,Wow.
00:00:42,00:00:43,Really?
00:00:43,00:00:44,That is.
00:00:44,00:00:46,"So we got that fact through, and I have no idea what that means."
00:00:46,00:00:47,"Yes, I could."
00:00:47,00:00:48,What does that mean?
00:00:48,00:00:53,"Twice, the resident of the White House, has also been a keeper of sheep."
00:00:53,00:01:00,"The first of them was Thomas Jefferson, who, when he lived on his plantation, had corn"
00:01:00,00:01:07,"and wheat and tried to rotate them, but found that the soil was rapidly blitzed, essentially."
00:01:07,00:01:11,"And then realized that sheep were the way forward, that they fertilized the soil."
00:01:11,00:01:14,They were super animals.
00:01:14,00:01:19,"And so when he was president, he actually bought sheep with him to the White House."
00:01:19,00:01:24,And the ram that he was most pleased with in terms of the sheep that he thought would become
00:01:24,00:01:27,America's sheep was a shetland ram.
00:01:27,00:01:32,"Now, in the early days of America, when we think of the White House, we're obviously thinking"
00:01:32,00:01:37,"of something behind layers and layers and layers of security, but it used to be a house"
00:01:37,00:01:39,and you could walk on those grounds.
00:01:39,00:01:43,"So the sheep were in the White House grounds, in the lawn or whatever."
00:01:43,00:01:48,But this ram was incredibly violent.
00:01:48,00:01:52,"There were official letters from William Kew, who states that he was left black and blue"
00:01:52,00:01:54,by this ram.
00:01:54,00:01:59,"And in another letter, it transpires that actually a small boy was killed by one of Jefferson's"
00:01:59,00:02:00,rooms.
00:02:00,00:02:01,No.
00:02:01,00:02:02,Yeah.
00:02:02,00:02:03,Oh man.
00:02:03,00:02:04,Very hard to imagine that happening today.
00:02:04,00:02:05,Today with the White House.
00:02:05,00:02:06,But that's true.
00:02:06,00:02:10,"Because I was looking into when George Washington, because obviously he was the first resident"
00:02:10,00:02:11,in the White House.
00:02:11,00:02:15,"And it was exactly like that, like people could just come and go, however they wanted."
00:02:15,00:02:18,"And he had to put a law and that stopped people just wandering in off the street to go, ""Hey,"
00:02:18,00:02:19,"how's it going?"""
00:02:19,00:02:22,"He said that he'd be doing work and people would walk in and just going, ""Hey, it's just"
00:02:22,00:02:23,passing.
00:02:23,00:02:24,Are you going good?
00:02:24,00:02:25,"It seems to be going great."""
00:02:25,00:02:27,"Bill Clinton was attacked by a sheep, wasn't he?"
00:02:27,00:02:28,Remember that?
00:02:28,00:02:29,"And we were talking about that early, weren't we?"
00:02:29,00:02:30,Yes.
00:02:30,00:02:31,And I can't remember when.
00:02:31,00:02:35,It was just a child and he's ever since been scared of sheep.
00:02:35,00:02:36,Really?
00:02:36,00:02:37,"Yeah, apparently."
00:02:37,00:02:40,"He said it was the awfulest beating I ever took, but I don't know if that was before"
00:02:40,00:02:46,after the whole moniker attack.
00:02:46,00:02:54,"The other president was Woodrow Wilson, who, when he declared war on Germany in 1917, the"
00:02:54,00:02:59,"ground staff, by this point, they were ground staff for the White House."
00:02:59,00:03:02,"And because it was, you know, we are one nation."
00:03:02,00:03:11,He freed them to all join the American military and bought sheep instead because the sheep
00:03:11,00:03:15,would nibble the grass and it would be a sort of cheap upkeep.
00:03:15,00:03:20,"I mean, they can't sculpt hedges as beautifully as some expensive White House ground staff, can"
00:03:20,00:03:21,they?
00:03:21,00:03:24,"I like, yeah, I read that they were as replacement for all of his garden staff."
00:03:24,00:03:29,"How good are they at planting, you know, a nice bed of roses?"
00:03:29,00:03:32,"Yeah, but to be fair, they are definitely much worse."
00:03:32,00:03:33,In a wall.
00:03:33,00:03:34,Let's do it.
00:03:34,00:03:35,A human men.
00:03:35,00:03:38,"Very hard, sheep's thighs."
00:03:38,00:03:46,Did anyone call him Woodrow Wilson at the time?
00:03:46,00:03:47,They should have done.
00:03:47,00:03:49,They were known as Wilson's Woolies.
00:03:49,00:03:50,"Oh, no."
00:03:50,00:03:51,"Oh, really?"
00:03:51,00:03:58,And the ram of this flock was incredibly well known.
00:03:58,00:03:59,He was known as...
00:03:59,00:04:00,Is that old egg?
00:04:00,00:04:01,Old egg.
00:04:01,00:04:02,Yes.
00:04:02,00:04:03,Who...
00:04:03,00:04:04,Smoked.
00:04:04,00:04:05,So who...
00:04:05,00:04:06,"Well, who loved tobacco?"
00:04:06,00:04:11,"And anybody who dropped cigar butts in the White House grounds, he would make a bead line"
00:04:11,00:04:12,from him.
00:04:12,00:04:13,"I don't think he smoked, really."
00:04:13,00:04:15,"No, that was an exaggeration, you're right."
00:04:15,00:04:17,"He was chewing the tobacco, wasn't he?"
00:04:17,00:04:18,Yeah.
00:04:18,00:04:21,"One interesting thing about Woodrow Wilson is he had a stroke in, after the war."
00:04:21,00:04:24,I think it was in 1919 or 1920.
00:04:24,00:04:29,And his wife took over the de facto running of the country.
00:04:29,00:04:33,"And she was in charge when the 19th Amendment was passed, which was votes for women."
00:04:33,00:04:34,Really?
00:04:34,00:04:37,"Yeah, she was officially the president, but she was like de facto president."
00:04:37,00:04:38,That's amazing.
00:04:38,00:04:41,"Because of that sort of invalidates the whole votes for women thing, doesn't it?"
00:04:41,00:04:43,There wasn't even a man in jobs at the time.
00:04:43,00:04:50,"Right, we're going to have to go back and recount all the votes, very calibrate."
00:04:50,00:04:54,Who was the president who basically died post his inauguration?
00:04:54,00:04:55,Oh.
00:04:55,00:04:56,Because he did an hour and forty...
00:04:56,00:04:57,Will you have Henry Harrison?
00:04:57,00:04:58,Yeah.
00:04:58,00:05:00,I hadn't heard of that until I read the presidency.
00:05:00,00:05:02,Did you know about this very first?
00:05:02,00:05:03,"Well, yes."
00:05:03,00:05:09,"He was already ill at his inauguration, but he stood outside for so long that it exacerbated the"
00:05:09,00:05:10,symptom and he can't...
00:05:10,00:05:12,"He should have had a nice woolen jumper, shouldn't he?"
00:05:12,00:05:13,Yes.
00:05:13,00:05:15,He didn't wear a coat or a hat.
00:05:15,00:05:16,Did he not?
00:05:16,00:05:17,He was being...
00:05:17,00:05:18,I don't know.
00:05:18,00:05:19,I have no gloves.
00:05:19,00:05:20,He was trying to show...
00:05:20,00:05:22,"Because there were all these reports that he wasn't strong enough, that he wasn't interesting"
00:05:22,00:05:24,"enough, that he didn't do long enough speeches."
00:05:24,00:05:30,I'll show them with my naked 10 hour speech and with the snow.
00:05:30,00:05:33,"I read it as well, because I've just been looking at the presidents at the White House and"
00:05:33,00:05:37,"sort of interesting things that they did while they were there, so keeping sheep."
00:05:37,00:05:41,"One, and this isn't properly confirmed, but a lot of people seem to think it's true."
00:05:41,00:05:45,Grover Cleveland used to piss out the window in the Oval Office.
00:05:45,00:05:47,"Yeah, it used to pop the window up."
00:05:47,00:05:48,Yeah.
00:05:48,00:05:49,It's a rumor.
00:05:49,00:05:54,It wouldn't be good when the public were just walking through the grounds at the time.
00:05:54,00:05:55,When you say it's a rumor...
00:05:55,00:05:56,Why the sheep yellow?
00:05:56,00:05:57,What's going on?
00:05:57,00:06:01,"Well, you know that you can find a bright yellow sheep in Devon."
00:06:01,00:06:02,What?
00:06:02,00:06:04,"I mean, yes."
00:06:04,00:06:10,"This one of the things I looked up was about sheep rustling, that actually it's going through"
00:06:10,00:06:17,"the roof over the last 10 years, sheep rustling, and what do they call it, rural crime, has gone"
00:06:17,00:06:23,"up to something like 125 percent, and whole flocks have been going missing, but one of the"
00:06:23,00:06:27,"things is if you take a flock of any kind of size, you actually need a field to put them"
00:06:27,00:06:28,in.
00:06:28,00:06:29,You know what I mean?
00:06:29,00:06:30,You can't just leave them in a lock-up.
00:06:30,00:06:31,Yeah.
00:06:31,00:06:38,"So there must be farms that are basically hiding these sheep, and there's so much open green"
00:06:38,00:06:40,"space, you know, where are they?"
00:06:40,00:06:46,"So farmers have taken to dying their sheep, neon yellow, neon blue, neon pink."
00:06:46,00:06:53,"That way, if their flock ever goes missing, and then, you know, five hills away, whatever,"
00:06:53,00:06:54,whatever.
00:06:54,00:06:57,I just saw a bright pink sheep in Devon.
00:06:57,00:07:00,This was a news article in Turkey earlier this year.
00:07:00,00:07:04,"There were some Turkish shepherds who were in a field, and they..."
00:07:04,00:07:05,Turkey shepherds.
00:07:05,00:07:06,"Oh, boy."
00:07:06,00:07:07,Wow.
00:07:07,00:07:11,"They were in a field, and the field was next to a cliff."
00:07:11,00:07:13,"And one of the sheep, there were 1,500 sheep in this field."
00:07:13,00:07:17,"And one of them was off a cliff, and all the other sheep followed."
00:07:17,00:07:21,"So all 1,500 sheep in this village climbed fell off a cliff."
00:07:21,00:07:28,"And the first 400 died, but then the next 1,100 survived because they landed on the dead bodies"
00:07:28,00:07:29,of the sheep.
00:07:29,00:07:30,"Oh, my God."
00:07:30,00:07:34,"I mean, I know that the sheep are quite fluffy, but I didn't think they were that fluffy."
00:07:34,00:07:37,That's something if you landed at speed on the sheep.
00:07:37,00:07:38,You could be really bad.
00:07:38,00:07:39,"You think so, wouldn't you?"
00:07:39,00:07:41,"They're not like clouds, you know."
00:07:41,00:07:43,But define fluffing.
00:07:43,00:07:46,Like 400 of them had to die first.
00:07:46,00:07:47,"Yeah, that's true."
00:07:47,00:07:50,"Sure, if you pile 400 hedgehogs off a cliff."
00:07:50,00:07:55,"Like, the 401st one's going to basically be landing on meaty squelch."
00:07:55,00:08:03,Meaty squelch does make it sound like a less appealing prospect than the big pull of fluff.
00:08:03,00:08:05,"Yeah, I was a bit ashamed."
00:08:05,00:08:09,Have we ever mentioned on the podcast the idea that sheep just used to shear themselves?
00:08:09,00:08:11,What?
00:08:11,00:08:13,They just used to just want and then got laid down.
00:08:13,00:08:16,They used to shear each other is what you mean.
00:08:16,00:08:20,"No, they used to shed their wool on their own."
00:08:20,00:08:24,And we've breaded out of them because we've wanted to make it a thing where we could do it when we want.
00:08:24,00:08:30,"Well, sheep peeling is going to be a thing in the future where you kind of put a protein into the sheep"
00:08:30,00:08:33,and it makes the wool kind of detach itself.
00:08:33,00:08:35,"And then instead of shearing it, you just kind of peel it off."
00:08:35,00:08:38,"Is that like an apple and if you peel it off, can you throw it in the air?"
00:08:38,00:08:43,"And whatever lesser shape it lands in, is the initial of who you're going to marry?"
00:08:43,00:08:46,"Well, for try other things."
00:08:46,00:08:50,"I mean, I know, e-harmony isn't working for you."
00:08:50,00:08:54,I've been through so many apples. It's just not working.
00:08:54,00:08:58,"Did they come, do you peel it in one big chunk or..."
00:08:58,00:09:00,"Yeah, I think that's the idea, yeah."
00:09:00,00:09:07,"Well, maybe you just make a tunnel out of the scratchy side of Velcro and run the sheep on both the other end."
00:09:07,00:09:09,"Fire it through, you just can't, innit?"
00:09:09,00:09:12,What can we get that for us?
00:09:12,00:09:18,"So instead of getting your hair cut, you just inject something under your skin"
00:09:18,00:09:23,and then you just peel your whole hair off and then it saves time.
00:09:23,00:09:26,"I mean, middle aged men around the world are spending billions of pounds"
00:09:26,00:09:29,front of the exact opposite of the thing you just described.
00:09:29,00:09:32,"Yeah, that's the most redundant invention."
00:09:32,00:09:39,"It's something to make men bold, yeah, order now and get these three impotent hills."
00:09:39,00:09:46,"Okay, time for back number two and that is Harkin."
00:09:46,00:09:55,"Okay, my fact this week is that there is a village in Russia where every single person knows how to tightrope walk."
00:09:55,00:09:58,"Is it just a coincidence, like, they're in a pub one day?"
00:09:58,00:10:01,"I was like, you know, I can do this really weird thing."
00:10:01,00:10:03,"Oh my god, me too."
00:10:03,00:10:06,"They can all wiggle their ears or something like that, that'd be good."
00:10:06,00:10:12,"This is a village called Sofkuladian and it's in Dagestan, so it's in the south of Russia."
00:10:12,00:10:16,The population is about 400 and everyone knows how to tightrope walk.
00:10:16,00:10:19,"The most popular story of how it happened is that a hundred years ago,"
00:10:19,00:10:23,"the young men had to go to another village to find girls and to do that,"
00:10:23,00:10:26,they had to go up and down a mountain.
00:10:26,00:10:30,"And instead of doing that, they would set up a tightrope walk and then they would do it."
00:10:30,00:10:35,"But the most common, most likely explanation is it was just bad weather in the area"
00:10:35,00:10:38,and they needed a fix to get over rivers and things like that.
00:10:38,00:10:43,"So they did it when the foot bridges would get washed away, they would use tightrope."
00:10:43,00:10:46,But what's interesting is you say 400 people there.
00:10:46,00:10:51,"I've read the article as well and it's quite depressing because this guy is saying,"
00:10:51,00:10:56,"he used to have 7,000 people there."
00:10:56,00:11:02,"Actually only the first 2,000 died."
00:11:02,00:11:08,"Yeah, he's really upset because this was the place for tightrope walking and now it's endangered."
00:11:08,00:11:12,It's an endangered tightrope walking village and he's saying we have no funding.
00:11:12,00:11:15,"So if anyone wants to start a Kickstarter for them, they need money."
00:11:15,00:11:18,"Actually, all the villages in Russia are pretty much empty these days."
00:11:18,00:11:22,"Everybody's gone to the cities and I think there's like, I don't know,"
00:11:22,00:11:25,hundreds of thousands of villages with fewer than the dozen people in them know.
00:11:25,00:11:26,In Russia.
00:11:26,00:11:32,"I have a fact on that, which is that there are 23 villages in the Krasnoyarsk region with only men in them."
00:11:32,00:11:33,Really?
00:11:33,00:11:38,"Yeah, and the article about this from a Russian website says that several have only one resident,"
00:11:38,00:11:41,which I don't know if that makes it a village or not.
00:11:41,00:11:44,I think that's almost been demoted to a hamlet by that point.
00:11:44,00:11:47,"Just a house, isn't it?"
00:11:47,00:11:51,"Weirdly, in all of those villages, top gear."
00:11:51,00:11:55,Absolutely correct.
00:11:55,00:11:58,"But the opposite of that, you said that's a town full of men, right?"
00:11:58,00:12:05,"There's a town of only ladies in Brazil could noiva de Cordereo, I can't say it properly."
00:12:05,00:12:08,But it's about 600 women in this town.
00:12:08,00:12:12,And the reason it's only women is that the men go away during the weekdays and they work
00:12:12,00:12:14,and they only come back on the weekends.
00:12:14,00:12:18,"And as soon as you hit 18 as a boy and you become a man, you have to leave the village."
00:12:18,00:12:20,So it's an entire town full of ladies.
00:12:20,00:12:23,And it's been advertised as like single ladies looking.
00:12:23,00:12:29,So he's suggesting we maybe build a tightrope between Andes all male village and your female village.
00:12:29,00:12:31,"Yeah, that's a long walk."
00:12:31,00:12:35,You've really earned your woman at the end of the day.
00:12:35,00:12:41,"I mean, it's a long way, but it is a straight line."
00:12:41,00:12:43,This is just a village fact.
00:12:43,00:12:51,"There's this little village in Kazakhstan called Kalachi, where this sickness has just like afflicted the quarter of the population,"
00:12:51,00:12:55,"which is a sleeping sickness, where people keep inexplicably falling into brief comers."
00:12:55,00:12:57,So people keep on just falling asleep.
00:12:57,00:12:59,They have complete memory loss.
00:12:59,00:13:02,"They're left with kind of dizziness, nausea, headaches."
00:13:02,00:13:04,And no one knows what it is.
00:13:04,00:13:06,They just keep asking how it's narrow uranium plants.
00:13:06,00:13:12,"So people are like, ""What about that?"" But apart from that, it's completely normal little village."
00:13:12,00:13:18,No explanation for these very sleepy people and these very bright yellow sheep.
00:13:18,00:13:25,"I was looking into, because I love that idea of everyone in the village does a thing."
00:13:25,00:13:30,So I started looking into villages and towns where everyone does that one thing.
00:13:30,00:13:31,And I found a couple.
00:13:31,00:13:41,"So one is that, this is quite nice. There's a town in Spain, which is there's only 318 residents, and they've all been scanned as 3D models."
00:13:41,00:13:43,Every resident is a 3D toy now.
00:13:43,00:13:49,"And you can go and look at the town of all the people living there just as 3D models, which is quite cool."
00:13:49,00:13:53,"There's a really good one, which was in Jakarta, an entire town."
00:13:53,00:14:01,"Basically, the police took and decided to burn 3.3 tons of marijuana, because they were like, ""We're going to be taking this away."""
00:14:01,00:14:05,"They got an entire village high, the wind blew the smoke."
00:14:05,00:14:09,And so this entire village would just off their heads for ages.
00:14:09,00:14:17,Have you seen that video of the BBC reporter trying to do the link mix of the pile of burning heroin?
00:14:17,00:14:18,Wow!
00:14:18,00:14:22,I'm in Google it now. Pause this podcast and go look at it.
00:14:22,00:14:26,He literally cannot hold it together past the first four words.
00:14:26,00:14:30,I think the exceptional reporting is so good.
00:14:30,00:14:32,Some stuff on tightrope.
00:14:32,00:14:33,"Yes, yeah."
00:14:33,00:14:34,Why not?
00:14:34,00:14:42,"In 5th century France, the tightrope walkers were forbidden to go near churches for some reason."
00:14:42,00:14:44,Was it in case they set up a line?
00:14:44,00:14:48,Because some people did go from Notre Dame's to towers between them.
00:14:48,00:14:50,That was a big thing in France.
00:14:50,00:14:54,"No, it was mostly like the church used to look down on actors as well."
00:14:54,00:14:56,You can't look down on a tightrope walker.
00:14:56,00:14:58,"Well, they're doing it wrong."
00:14:58,00:15:06,"But the thing is that all the fares were held near churches, and the fares were the places where the tightrope walkers did their thing."
00:15:06,00:15:11,"So basically, it was a ban on all of tightrope walking in the 5th century France."
00:15:11,00:15:15,Didn't work. Did it? We've still got it today. Yes.
00:15:15,00:15:17,Does anyone else find it really surprising that it was only...
00:15:17,00:15:23,Was it last year or the year before that someone walked on a tightrope across the Grand Canyon?
00:15:23,00:15:25,It seemed like the most obvious thing you'd do.
00:15:25,00:15:25,"Oh, yeah."
00:15:25,00:15:27,And then Knicksick or London was the fares.
00:15:27,00:15:29,It's so obvious.
00:15:29,00:15:31,It's so obvious.
00:15:31,00:15:35,"I like the fact that they had to put a 10-second delay that was shown live,"
00:15:35,00:15:37,except that there was a 10-second delay on the footage wasn't there.
00:15:37,00:15:38,In case it felt.
00:15:38,00:15:41,"In case something happened. So I mean, I don't know what they would have done."
00:15:41,00:15:44,"I guess they just black out the programme and go, ""Well, that's done."""
00:15:44,00:15:46,Up to the next.
00:15:46,00:15:49,"So Nick Wellender is a very, very famous tightrope walker."
00:15:49,00:15:53,But you know he's from a family dating back generations of tightrope walkers.
00:15:53,00:15:59,"So the Wellender's Carl Wellender was one of the most famous, but he was going in the 1920s."
00:15:59,00:16:01,And he set up the...
00:16:01,00:16:05,"One of the hardest things to do is a human pyramid on a tightrope, unsurprisingly."
00:16:05,00:16:08,"So you have two walkers on a rope, one in front of the other."
00:16:08,00:16:12,"They have a bar on their shoulders, and you have a third walker on the bar."
00:16:12,00:16:13,Wow.
00:16:13,00:16:15,It gets even better.
00:16:15,00:16:20,The Wellender family did a seven-person pyramid.
00:16:20,00:16:23,Right? So you have four men at the bottom going in pairs.
00:16:23,00:16:25,There are two lines. So you've got a square.
00:16:25,00:16:28,They both have a bar on each of them.
00:16:28,00:16:32,And there are two men on the next level up on each of those bars.
00:16:32,00:16:38,"Those two men have a chair between them on their shoulders, and a woman is standing on the chair or sitting on the chair."
00:16:38,00:16:39,Right.
00:16:39,00:16:40,And they did this for decades without incident.
00:16:40,00:16:46,"And then in 1962, they did have an accident, and two of them fell and died, and one of them fell and was paralyzed."
00:16:46,00:16:48,And the other four managed to cling onto the rope.
00:16:48,00:16:49,Of the Wellenders?
00:16:49,00:16:50,"Yeah, of the Wellenders."
00:16:50,00:16:51,They lost two Wellenders.
00:16:51,00:16:52,"Yeah, they were a family."
00:16:52,00:16:53,"Yeah, they did that."
00:16:53,00:16:58,What I like about tightrope is how basically they just make it as difficult as possible.
00:16:58,00:17:04,"And then in this human pyramid or going over a line cage, it's just like it's not enough that you're walking from one place to another."
00:17:04,00:17:06,You have to do something done.
00:17:06,00:17:07,On the Lions.
00:17:07,00:17:08,"Oh, yeah."
00:17:08,00:17:15,"Blondon, who was one of the great tightrope walkers ever, he once did a tightrope walk with a lion cub in a wheelbarrow."
00:17:15,00:17:17,So he combined the lion and the tightrope.
00:17:17,00:17:18,Wow.
00:17:18,00:17:23,"But that was very dangerous, and he very nearly fell and died, because it was, line cubs are not light."
00:17:23,00:17:24,Yeah.
00:17:24,00:17:31,"And there are wheelbarrows, and it, obviously the line, you know, will bend a bit or it'll dip in the middle because you've got a wheelbarrow and a line."
00:17:31,00:17:39,"What you want to have is a wheelbarrow with two giraffes in it, with the next sticking out either way."
00:17:39,00:17:45,"Okay, I found someone called William Leonard Hunt, who performed under the state name, The Great Farini."
00:17:45,00:17:52,"One of his best ever tricks, this was in 1860, was crossing Niagara Falls with a washing machine tied to his back."
00:17:52,00:17:57,"And I don't know what that would have looked like, because in 1860 they didn't have modern washing machine."
00:17:57,00:18:01,"It wouldn't have been a massive one, like we have, but in the middle he stopped to wash several handkerchiefs."
00:18:01,00:18:05,"And then when he got to the other side, he gave them to, you know, his admirers."
00:18:05,00:18:08,"I don't know, it feels like washing machines would have been bigger in those days."
00:18:08,00:18:12,"Like those massive ones, which you open at the top and you shovel your stuff."
00:18:12,00:18:13,Yeah.
00:18:13,00:18:14,"Like, hang on."
00:18:14,00:18:17,Surely it was just like a bucket to the mangoes.
00:18:17,00:18:27,"I think your idea of what these wash machines are doing is like, they're only one step up from the Flintstones."
00:18:27,00:18:31,It's herodactyl with a mouthful of soap.
00:18:31,00:18:37,"Is this the same guy, or is it Blondon, who did the type of walk over Niagara, where?"
00:18:37,00:18:38,That was Blondon.
00:18:38,00:18:39,Is it Blondon?
00:18:39,00:18:45,"So he went over with his son, strapped to him at one point, within manager, giving his manager a piggyback."
00:18:45,00:18:50,"I wrote a report where they said that they didn't like the safety side of that, because someone else could get hurt."
00:18:50,00:18:53,So could he instead cook an omelette when he goes out on the stove?
00:18:53,00:18:54,It needs to be.
00:18:54,00:18:55,"Which he did, yeah."
00:18:55,00:18:56,But how did he cook it?
00:18:56,00:18:57,How did he make that suggestion?
00:18:57,00:18:59,He had a little stove.
00:18:59,00:19:01,"He had a miniature stove, and he had a pan."
00:19:01,00:19:03,"And to be fair, he didn't just fry an egg or something."
00:19:03,00:19:04,He went omelette.
00:19:04,00:19:05,"Oh, I can't stop."
00:19:05,00:19:06,Yeah.
00:19:06,00:19:10,"Chopped a few china chives, yeah."
00:19:10,00:19:15,"Oh, needs cumin, had to go back."
00:19:15,00:19:16,"Yeah, so it's only a little stove."
00:19:16,00:19:17,It's not like an hour ago.
00:19:17,00:19:18,He was carrying on his back.
00:19:18,00:19:20,"No, it took a full kitchen."
00:19:20,00:19:26,So Nick Wollenders says he refuses to use safety nets.
00:19:26,00:19:27,He never has done.
00:19:27,00:19:30,"He's had to once, because he had to buy lots when he was going over Niagara Falls, I think."
00:19:30,00:19:35,"And he says, my great-grandfather taught that safety nets offer a full sense of security."
00:19:35,00:19:36,So I never used them.
00:19:36,00:19:39,"I mean, how full is that sense of security?"
00:19:39,00:19:40,I don't see.
00:19:40,00:19:42,Are they just an illusion of safety nets?
00:19:42,00:19:45,"Well, no, but I met Philip Petit once years ago."
00:19:45,00:19:48,Philip Petit was the guy who walked the twin towers.
00:19:48,00:19:49,"Oh, wow."
00:19:49,00:19:52,"If you've seen, yeah, man on wire, that documentary."
00:19:52,00:19:58,"And so he came, the QI used to have a building in Oxford, and he came and did a book signing there."
00:19:58,00:19:59,So he arrived.
00:19:59,00:20:00,Do you know what?
00:20:00,00:20:02,He starts all of his features on the top of the ladder.
00:20:02,00:20:05,"So he came and he was like, do you have a ladder?"
00:20:05,00:20:06,So we got him a ladder.
00:20:06,00:20:10,"And so as everyone came in, he was just perched at the top of the ladder."
00:20:10,00:20:15,"And someone asked him in the Q&A section, at any point when you were walking between the twin towers,"
00:20:15,00:20:17,"did you think, oh my god, I'm going to fall?"
00:20:17,00:20:18,And he got furious at them.
00:20:18,00:20:20,He said he doesn't acknowledge the idea of falling.
00:20:20,00:20:24,"He said that just, you would never do it if that was even thought to be a possibility."
00:20:24,00:20:27,"And then he said, and if I did fall, I would fly."
00:20:27,00:20:28,"I thought, hmm."
00:20:28,00:20:30,Okay.
00:20:30,00:20:39,There's a pin-line between confidence and mental instability.
00:20:39,00:20:43,"Time for fact, number three, and that is Chazinsky."
00:20:43,00:20:47,"My fight is that in Britain, pedestrians step to the right to avoid each other."
00:20:47,00:20:49,"And in Japan, they step to the left."
00:20:49,00:20:50,And nobody knows why.
00:20:50,00:20:51,It's just weird.
00:20:51,00:20:53,"So it's totally, yeah."
00:20:53,00:21:02,So it actually is like every country has pedestrians tend to have a strong preference for stepping to a certain side when they're about to walk into another pedestrian.
00:21:02,00:21:09,But it bears no relation to what side of the road they drive on or what side of the road you're supposed to walk on.
00:21:09,00:21:11,"Because in Japan, the drive on the left as well."
00:21:11,00:21:13,So you would expect it to be the same way.
00:21:13,00:21:14,Yeah.
00:21:14,00:21:17,"So you can get really obsessed, as I did, with pedestrian behaviour."
00:21:17,00:21:22,"And I really do recommend reading the thousands of reports that have been put out, mainly by the two same guys."
00:21:22,00:21:28,"So for instance, we act differently if we are going to collide with someone on a staircase."
00:21:28,00:21:34,"So when we're walking along a pavement, we tend to only put into action avoidance behaviour when we're about a metre away."
00:21:34,00:21:38,"But if people meet on a staircase, they do it right at the start of the staircase."
00:21:38,00:21:41,So you see someone right at the bottom and you decide there.
00:21:41,00:21:43,"Okay, I'm going to step to the right now to avoid them."
00:21:43,00:21:48,So Richard Wiseman did a study about how quickly people walk in cities.
00:21:48,00:21:56,And he asked people to send him data and whatever. And he found that the fastest city in the world for people walking 20 yards is Singapore.
00:21:56,00:22:02,"And they, on average, walk at 10 seconds, 10.55 seconds to walk 20 yards."
00:22:02,00:22:05,Copenhagen was next. London was about halfway down.
00:22:05,00:22:09,It takes about 12.17 seconds to walk 20 yards.
00:22:09,00:22:15,"And everyone's between about 10 and 17 seconds, apart from one place called Blantire in Malawi."
00:22:15,00:22:16,I've been there.
00:22:16,00:22:17,Have you?
00:22:17,00:22:23,"I walk at 31.6 seconds per 20 yards, which is more than twice as much as anyone else."
00:22:23,00:22:24,Oh my god.
00:22:24,00:22:27,It's just like really like very pedestrian.
00:22:27,00:22:28,Did you notice that?
00:22:28,00:22:29,Did you notice that?
00:22:29,00:22:32,So I went on Wikipedia to see what reason there could be behind that.
00:22:32,00:22:37,And it says the most conspicuous and dominant physical feature of the city is a numerous hills.
00:22:37,00:22:39,So it could be that.
00:22:39,00:22:40,"Oh, yeah."
00:22:40,00:22:41,They're walking up.
00:22:41,00:22:48,So surely that would average out.
00:22:48,00:22:50,Just with things going right and left.
00:22:50,00:22:55,"I read a thing and actually, Rufus, you might know more about this because you've done a lot of stage acting."
00:22:55,00:22:57,Villains exit stage left.
00:22:57,00:22:58,Yes.
00:22:58,00:22:59,Is that a true thing?
00:22:59,00:23:00,It's in Pantamine.
00:23:00,00:23:01,Okay.
00:23:01,00:23:03,More than in sort of all theatre.
00:23:03,00:23:08,"But yeah, obviously the Latin for left was sinister."
00:23:08,00:23:12,And so that's where we get things on the left being sinister.
00:23:12,00:23:13,Oh really?
00:23:13,00:23:17,"Yeah, all Pantamine Villains exit stage left and the goodies exit stage right."
00:23:17,00:23:19,Or enter and exit stage left and right.
00:23:19,00:23:21,So is that how you spot the villain in a pantomime?
00:23:21,00:23:22,Because I've never been quite sure.
00:23:22,00:23:24,They're very subtle about that.
00:23:24,00:23:26,"Yeah, it's fine by that."
00:23:26,00:23:27,Those are the clues you're looking for.
00:23:27,00:23:29,You're always leaving pantomimes going.
00:23:29,00:23:30,I liked it.
00:23:30,00:23:34,I thought it was very powerful and ambiguous.
00:23:34,00:23:39,"But yeah, so I read that even Hershey with Tintin, he used to do that as well."
00:23:39,00:23:44,"If you would face a certain way, so you would face right if you were progressing as a character."
00:23:44,00:23:47,And then you would face left if things were suddenly going against you.
00:23:47,00:23:48,Yeah.
00:23:48,00:23:51,Didn't we do something about cowboy films?
00:23:51,00:23:52,"Yeah, we did."
00:23:52,00:23:56,"That the good guys go from left to right, I think, on the screen."
00:23:56,00:23:59,"And really, this is in really early cowboy films, which is mostly, you know, it's..."
00:23:59,00:24:00,Yeah.
00:24:00,00:24:05,"And also usually the bad guy dresses in black, I think, and the bad guy dresses in white."
00:24:05,00:24:08,"That would have been a technical thing, wouldn't it?"
00:24:08,00:24:11,And like a cultural thing that in black and white.
00:24:11,00:24:17,Have you seen the old makeup that film actresses used to wear in black and white movies?
00:24:17,00:24:18,"Oh, I think so."
00:24:18,00:24:21,So they had like green paint on their faces.
00:24:21,00:24:24,And then the lips were like bright blue.
00:24:24,00:24:33,Because the way it registered on old chromatic black and white film was that it looked most likely to be red and...
00:24:33,00:24:35,And things were registered in that way.
00:24:35,00:24:37,That must have been so hard to act.
00:24:37,00:24:40,Is that why they're all a little bit less believable in black and white films?
00:24:40,00:24:44,As long as Olivia is looking at someone like fluorescent face.
00:24:44,00:24:45,Wow.
00:24:45,00:24:47,"Darling, I love you very much."
00:24:47,00:24:49,You look ridiculous.
00:24:49,00:24:55,"I read horses, apparently, are better at running if you have a race horse."
00:24:55,00:24:59,It depends over the distance.
00:24:59,00:25:02,There is an annual man-v-horse race.
00:25:02,00:25:03,"In Wales, isn't it?"
00:25:03,00:25:04,Yeah.
00:25:04,00:25:07,And we kill it over the ten-yard dash.
00:25:07,00:25:10,"We kill it, well then, obviously we win."
00:25:10,00:25:13,The way that that works is it's over.
00:25:13,00:25:15,"It's round lots of tight corners, isn't it?"
00:25:15,00:25:18,So the horse struggles to get round those.
00:25:18,00:25:20,And there are bits of up and down.
00:25:20,00:25:23,It's done in a way that makes it almost equal between human and horse.
00:25:23,00:25:24,It's quite exciting.
00:25:24,00:25:26,So is it always been a human win?
00:25:26,00:25:27,"No, the human win."
00:25:27,00:25:30,For the first time quite about four or five years ago.
00:25:30,00:25:32,I think it's generally the horse that wins.
00:25:32,00:25:33,Yeah.
00:25:33,00:25:37,"But yeah, apparently if they go one way around a racetrack, is an advantage to most horses."
00:25:37,00:25:39,If you suddenly sent them around the other way.
00:25:39,00:25:40,"Oh, really?"
00:25:40,00:25:42,"Because yeah, there's something about being right foot to being."
00:25:42,00:25:45,"Of course, it's a right foot to be."
00:25:45,00:25:47,"You learn like anyone knows if you've ridden that you, when you go into a canter,"
00:25:47,00:25:49,you have to get it on its right leg.
00:25:49,00:25:51,"So you have to, when you're trotting and you go into a canter,"
00:25:51,00:25:53,you have to sit down at the right moment.
00:25:53,00:25:56,"Otherwise, you're on its wrong leg because they're right most of the right footed."
00:25:56,00:25:59,And you can tell it feels wrong if you sit down at the wrong time.
00:25:59,00:26:01,You can feel that it's really awkward.
00:26:01,00:26:04,"Very weirdly looking into pedestrian behaviour for this,"
00:26:04,00:26:07,"I found an article on the Chicago Tribune website which said,"
00:26:07,00:26:11,"""In Britain simply stepping off a curb means pedestrians walk a tightrope."""
00:26:11,00:26:13,"Not very interesting, but true."
00:26:13,00:26:14,Good link.
00:26:14,00:26:18,"Well, if we're doing sort of pavement style behaviour,"
00:26:18,00:26:22,"do you know why French actors say ""melt"" to each other?"
00:26:22,00:26:23,No.
00:26:23,00:26:24,"So we say ""break a leg."""
00:26:24,00:26:26,"Do you know what ""break a leg"" means?"
00:26:26,00:26:27,No.
00:26:27,00:26:31,"So the levers that lift the front curtain up and down,"
00:26:31,00:26:33,they're actually called legs.
00:26:33,00:26:36,And so if you've got lots and lots of standing ovations
00:26:36,00:26:38,"and the curtain had to come up and down on them,"
00:26:38,00:26:40,you would break a leg.
00:26:40,00:26:43,"So when actors wish each other ""break a leg"" that's where that comes from."
00:26:43,00:26:50,"But French actors say ""melt"" because if your run was going to be incredibly long,"
00:26:50,00:26:53,"if the play was going to be a huge success,"
00:26:53,00:26:56,then you would have lots of people coming into the theatre.
00:26:56,00:26:59,"And before there were pavements, the reason that we have pavements"
00:26:59,00:27:03,was that the horses would go in the road and that's where all the poo would go.
00:27:03,00:27:05,And the pedestrians could walk on the pavement.
00:27:05,00:27:08,And that was a raised thing to send us off from the poo.
00:27:08,00:27:11,"But before that, you were just trampling in poo all the time."
00:27:11,00:27:13,"So if your play ran for a long time,"
00:27:13,00:27:16,people would be treading poo into the theatre.
00:27:16,00:27:20,"So French actors wish each other ""melt"" meaning dragging a lot of..."
00:27:20,00:27:23,I hope the theatre is full of shit.
00:27:23,00:27:25,It's so great.
00:27:25,00:27:28,"Who came up with, like, they must have had an actor's meeting"
00:27:28,00:27:30,"the last thing about three hours going,"
00:27:30,00:27:32,"well, the processes and the horses are outside for ages,"
00:27:32,00:27:35,and so they poo and then we'll...
00:27:35,00:27:37,Probably I doubt there was a meeting.
00:27:37,00:27:38,There wasn't a meeting.
00:27:38,00:27:40,"Someone in Cabernet said, ""Okay, there's news from England."
00:27:40,00:27:42,They've got this new breaker leg thing.
00:27:42,00:27:44,"We need to get on to this now."""
00:27:44,00:27:47,"So they did experiments on, again, on pedestrians"
00:27:47,00:27:49,and seeing what distracts people.
00:27:49,00:27:53,"And they gathered up test walkers, as they called them,"
00:27:53,00:27:56,"into a virtual street crossing simulator,"
00:27:56,00:27:57,which I really like.
00:27:57,00:28:00,And they pumped in the noise of traffic through speakers.
00:28:00,00:28:03,And they measured how well these people crossed a virtual road
00:28:03,00:28:04,while having a phone conversation.
00:28:04,00:28:07,Because obviously you don't want to test it in the real world
00:28:07,00:28:09,"with actual traffic, so fair enough."
00:28:09,00:28:12,"But it was a real phone call, so they were speaking to one of the scientists."
00:28:12,00:28:16,And they did look both ways when they were crossing this virtual road.
00:28:16,00:28:19,"But they still were walking much more dangerously,"
00:28:19,00:28:21,so they had less time to spare.
00:28:21,00:28:23,They missed more chances to cross safely
00:28:23,00:28:25,and they had more close calls.
00:28:25,00:28:26,And I love this.
00:28:26,00:28:30,Some even got hit by a virtual car.
00:28:30,00:28:33,"We're just kind of the best car to be hit by, but still."
00:28:33,00:28:36,"And it basically, they compared it with doing other things."
00:28:36,00:28:39,"So listening to music seems to distract people much less,"
00:28:39,00:28:41,"maybe because it's a song you know, I don't know,"
00:28:41,00:28:43,or maybe just because you don't know what the other person will say.
00:28:43,00:28:46,"But also, it's as distracting to talk on your mobile phone"
00:28:46,00:28:49,as it is to do complicated mental arithmetic
00:28:49,00:28:51,while you're crossing the road.
00:28:51,00:28:52,Right.
00:28:52,00:28:54,They have the same effect on your cognitive ability.
00:28:54,00:28:57,"But this is why they banned being on the phone while you're driving,"
00:28:57,00:29:01,"like holding the phone to your ear, things like that, wasn't it?"
00:29:01,00:29:05,"Because largely it seems that your brain processes language,"
00:29:05,00:29:11,like the way in which your brain processes language interferes
00:29:11,00:29:15,with your other processes in a way that listen to music doesn't.
00:29:15,00:29:18,"Which is why, if you're studying,"
00:29:18,00:29:20,"but you want music on at the same time,"
00:29:20,00:29:22,you should listen to classical musical dance music
00:29:22,00:29:26,"without a vocal, because the moment there's a vocal,"
00:29:26,00:29:29,your brain processes get infused.
00:29:29,00:29:34,"In Chongqing, in China, they've now got a cell phone lane on pavements"
00:29:34,00:29:36,so that people who are using their phones go in that lane.
00:29:36,00:29:38,So I guess at least they just bump into each other.
00:29:38,00:29:39,Wow.
00:29:39,00:29:43,Some theatres in Broadway now have a cell phone section of seating
00:29:43,00:29:47,so that you can tweak and look at Facebook while the show is on.
00:29:47,00:29:49,That makes so much sense.
00:29:49,00:29:50,"No, it doesn't."
00:29:50,00:29:51,"No, it does not."
00:29:51,00:29:55,"Wow, I mean, it's a borne, if you're a sort of pure theatre,"
00:29:55,00:29:56,"go about that stage, yeah."
00:29:56,00:30:01,"But actually, there are some suggestions that producers are quite keen on this"
00:30:01,00:30:06,"because people do spend time, it turns out, tweeting about how much they're enjoying the show"
00:30:06,00:30:07,and it's bars and things like that.
00:30:07,00:30:10,"So they've got roped off sort of sections that, you know."
00:30:10,00:30:11,I'm into this.
00:30:11,00:30:12,I'm very into it.
00:30:12,00:30:15,"I don't want to sound I'll kick and with Andy on this, but that's that."
00:30:15,00:30:17,That is disgusting.
00:30:17,00:30:20,The last thing anybody would want me with Andy on there.
00:30:20,00:30:30,"Okay, time for our final fact of the show and that is Andrew Hunter Murray."
00:30:30,00:30:37,My fact is that half of all California condors were raised by glove puppets.
00:30:37,00:30:43,So condors are massive birds and it's sort of 10 feet wingspanes
00:30:43,00:30:46,and they evolved millions and millions of years ago.
00:30:46,00:30:47,They're fantastic things.
00:30:47,00:30:54,"They can fly 100 miles a day looking for food, but they were not very well suited to the 20th century."
00:30:54,00:30:57,They were shot a lot and they would fly into power lines and things like that.
00:30:57,00:31:01,"And in 1987, there were just 22 left of these birds."
00:31:01,00:31:03,And they were all taken into captivity.
00:31:03,00:31:05,They were rounded up because they just weren't safe.
00:31:05,00:31:08,They couldn't be guaranteed that they'd survive.
00:31:08,00:31:12,And they were bred in zoos and they were bred by puppets.
00:31:12,00:31:14,So why?
00:31:14,00:31:19,"Well, the good thing about condors is that when they lay an egg, if you take the egg away,"
00:31:19,00:31:22,they assume that the egg has smashed on the ground or that it's not survived somehow.
00:31:22,00:31:25,And so they will be able to lay another one within that breeding season.
00:31:25,00:31:29,"And if you do that again, they'll lay another one the next breeding season quite quickly."
00:31:29,00:31:32,So basically you can quadruple the number of eggs that they lay.
00:31:32,00:31:35,They'll really twist them off in the process.
00:31:35,00:31:42,"They will annoy them, but three eggs that humans can raise and you'll have the fourth egg which the condor parents can raise."
00:31:42,00:31:44,So that's what they did.
00:31:44,00:31:46,"They took the three eggs, they incubated them."
00:31:46,00:31:49,"And when they were born, they made leather glove puppets."
00:31:49,00:31:51,"And you have to look them up, the pictures are incredible."
00:31:51,00:31:53,I'll put them on my Twitter.
00:31:53,00:31:58,And it's really weird seeing them interacting with also puppet-looking baby condors.
00:31:58,00:32:01,Which don't they look really rubbery and strange and odd.
00:32:01,00:32:06,And they drowned out the noise by playing the sounds of rivers and streams.
00:32:06,00:32:08,And they poked the puppets through a one-way screen.
00:32:08,00:32:11,So you couldn't see the human behind.
00:32:11,00:32:17,"One of the people who cares for them, this guy, I think, a quote from a guy called Ron Webb,"
00:32:17,00:32:23,"who's a senior condor keeper, explained that he raises these baby condors with the help of a condor hand puppet."
00:32:23,00:32:27,"And then he goes on to say, ""The puppet is like a fancy glove."""
00:32:27,00:32:33,Who ever needs an explanation for what hand puppet is.
00:32:33,00:32:35,I love a good one.
00:32:35,00:32:37,"It is a fancy glove, isn't it?"
00:32:37,00:32:40,It's not like I go to the ball wearing this.
00:32:40,00:32:45,"Well, Contessa, your city is looking especially delightful this evening."
00:32:45,00:32:50,"Hey, speaking of city, I looked into city because I was just going into the glove puppet territory."
00:32:50,00:32:52,Do you know how city came about?
00:32:52,00:32:54,Does anyone know the origin story?
00:32:54,00:32:57,It was a hit bitten by a radio actor.
00:32:57,00:32:59,Wasn't it a gift?
00:32:59,00:33:04,"No, so a reality show on the BBC called BBC's Talent Night."
00:33:04,00:33:07,"Effectively, Britain's got talent back in the 1950s."
00:33:07,00:33:11,And on that show stood a man with the city puppet.
00:33:11,00:33:13,"And he just, I don't even know what he did."
00:33:13,00:33:15,When that have been Harry Corbett.
00:33:15,00:33:16,"Harry Corbett, yeah."
00:33:16,00:33:18,"So Harry Corbett went on, he had Sutty."
00:33:18,00:33:20,That's what made it through the heat.
00:33:20,00:33:21,"Yeah, he made it to the final."
00:33:21,00:33:23,Sutty is a reality TV star.
00:33:23,00:33:25,He's effectively the Susan Boyle of his time.
00:33:25,00:33:26,"He's a, like, he's a..."
00:33:26,00:33:27,He got voted.
00:33:27,00:33:28,That was his actor with Sutty singing.
00:33:28,00:33:29,I dreamed a dream.
00:33:29,00:33:30,Yeah.
00:33:30,00:33:32,But into Harry Corbett's here.
00:33:32,00:33:35,I've met Matthew Corbett.
00:33:35,00:33:38,Matthew Corbett's son worked on QI.
00:33:38,00:33:39,"Yeah, thank Corbett."
00:33:39,00:33:40,Thank Corbett worked on QI.
00:33:40,00:33:42,"He's our sound technician, QI."
00:33:42,00:33:43,Yeah.
00:33:43,00:33:45,"Ironically, given his family trade."
00:33:45,00:33:47,He was involved in helping to amplify people.
00:33:47,00:33:49,"Well, that's arguably what the apparently..."
00:33:49,00:33:50,Yes.
00:33:50,00:33:51,"What's that you say, Sutty?"
00:33:51,00:33:52,"Oh, yeah."
00:33:52,00:33:53,Yeah.
00:33:53,00:33:54,So it's just carrying...
00:33:54,00:33:55,"Oh, that's..."
00:33:55,00:33:56,I like that.
00:33:56,00:33:57,"And he listens, by the way."
00:33:57,00:33:58,"Oh, hello, Ben."
00:33:58,00:33:59,"Hey, Ben."
00:33:59,00:34:00,They're away.
00:34:00,00:34:01,That's so cool.
00:34:01,00:34:03,So Condos.
00:34:03,00:34:05,So the thing is all the...
00:34:05,00:34:08,All the condos which have been raised by these puppets.
00:34:08,00:34:10,They started behaving really weirdly.
00:34:10,00:34:13,So instead of staying in the wild and doing condos stuff.
00:34:13,00:34:15,They started posing for photos with...
00:34:15,00:34:17,"I mean, not posing, but, you know..."
00:34:17,00:34:19,They started completely being in photos with people.
00:34:19,00:34:22,They started attacking hikers shoelaces.
00:34:22,00:34:25,And they also started experimenting with group sex.
00:34:25,00:34:28,"Which is not normal condo behavior, I believe."
00:34:28,00:34:30,"Hey, who are you to judge?"
00:34:30,00:34:31,"Oh, yeah."
00:34:31,00:34:32,Normal.
00:34:32,00:34:33,Sure.
00:34:33,00:34:36,She's got only herself around that.
00:34:36,00:34:40,So the theory was because they hadn't been raised by wild birds.
00:34:40,00:34:43,That they didn't have proper role models for how to behave like a condo.
00:34:43,00:34:45,But the puppets...
00:34:45,00:34:48,"The cranes, because they've also done it with cranes."
00:34:48,00:34:50,And when they did the puppet reading with cranes.
00:34:50,00:34:54,The puppet read cranes would often abandon their eggs days before they were due to hatch.
00:34:54,00:34:56,"But really, really not long before."
00:34:56,00:34:59,So they just didn't have any idea of how to bring up...
00:34:59,00:35:02,"A check, the same way."
00:35:02,00:35:08,"So to fix this situation, the humans had to start behaving like condos with these glove puppets."
00:35:08,00:35:10,So that's when they showed them the screens.
00:35:10,00:35:12,But also they would sort of...
00:35:12,00:35:13,They would...
00:35:13,00:35:17,"This isn't nice, but they had to sort of hit the child condos a bit, the checks."
00:35:17,00:35:18,When they miss behave.
00:35:18,00:35:20,That must be the weirdest thing slapping a condor.
00:35:20,00:35:22,"And being paid, being paid to do that."
00:35:22,00:35:25,"Because that's not a voluntary job, you know."
00:35:25,00:35:28,Can I explain a rabbit hole that I went down looking at the...
00:35:28,00:35:29,"Yes, of course."
00:35:29,00:35:33,...was that the California condor went extinct in the world in 1987.
00:35:33,00:35:36,"So I was like, oh, let's see what else went extinct in 1987."
00:35:36,00:35:37,"Oh, cool."
00:35:37,00:35:40,"And that led me to discover that there's this thing called de-extinction,"
00:35:40,00:35:42,which is the attempt to bring back...
00:35:42,00:35:43,That Jurassic Park.
00:35:43,00:35:47,"Like Jurassic Park, essentially, to bring back extinct species."
00:35:47,00:35:52,And this year was the fifth generation of the Quagga.
00:35:52,00:36:00,"And the Quagga is a specifically patterned zebra, which had gone extinct."
00:36:00,00:36:03,And Quagga became a slang term just to mean all zebras.
00:36:03,00:36:10,"So the last Quagga, that genuine Quagga, died in 1883 in a zoo."
00:36:10,00:36:13,But nobody realised she was the last of her kind.
00:36:13,00:36:16,"And then it was realised that it wasn't a specific species,"
00:36:16,00:36:17,as much as a subspecies.
00:36:17,00:36:28,So you could selectively breed plain zebras to have the same markings and elements as a Quagga.
00:36:28,00:36:30,And they've done that successfully.
00:36:30,00:36:33,And now the fifth generation of Quagga has been reborn.
00:36:33,00:36:37,And then I found a list of likely candidates for de-extinction.
00:36:37,00:36:44,"So there's the Carolina parakeet, the passenger pigeon, which is the most common pigeon in America."
00:36:44,00:36:48,And was largely just like if they saw one they'd shoot it for a love.
00:36:48,00:36:51,That went the woolly mammoth.
00:36:51,00:36:54,I think we've all been expecting that for a while now.
00:36:54,00:36:57,"And the thing that I had no idea even ever existed,"
00:36:57,00:37:00,"when extinct 10,000 years ago, the woolly rhino."
00:37:00,00:37:02,"Oh, that sounds really cool."
00:37:02,00:37:03,Doesn't it?
00:37:03,00:37:04,Yeah.
00:37:04,00:37:05,Should have found those.
00:37:05,00:37:08,"Oh, yeah."
00:37:08,00:37:09,Just heal a rhino.
00:37:09,00:37:10,Yeah.
00:37:10,00:37:12,"It would have been very hot, though, wouldn't it?"
00:37:12,00:37:14,It would have been hot.
00:37:14,00:37:16,Is that what made it extinct?
00:37:16,00:37:18,It's just too hot.
00:37:18,00:37:20,What's the use?
00:37:20,00:37:26,"So one thing about surrogates is for giant pandas, they sometimes use rabbits."
00:37:26,00:37:31,So they'll put the giant panda clone eggs inside a rabbit.
00:37:31,00:37:32,"Oh, really?"
00:37:32,00:37:34,"So the rabbit could give birth to a panda and they're like, oh my god."
00:37:34,00:37:38,"That's going to be one braggie rabbit mom at the school gates, isn't it?"
00:37:38,00:37:39,And also--
00:37:39,00:37:40,That's my boy.
00:37:40,00:37:42,I'm not a rabbit.
00:37:42,00:37:44,"Because they look-- they're tiny and gross at first, aren't they?"
00:37:44,00:37:48,"So it'll give birth at first, and it's like a two-millimeter tall lump of skin"
00:37:48,00:37:50,and the other rabbits are going to take the piss.
00:37:50,00:37:51,It's like a new version of the ugly--
00:37:51,00:37:52,The ugly duckling.
00:37:52,00:37:53,Yeah.
00:37:53,00:37:54,The giant panda.
00:37:54,00:37:55,Yeah.
00:37:55,00:37:56,Speaking of--
00:37:56,00:37:57,It once was a hideous rabbit.
00:37:57,00:37:58,Yeah.
00:37:58,00:38:00,"With ears, all stubby and short."
00:38:00,00:38:03,"And all the other bunnies and so many words said,"
00:38:03,00:38:05,"bloody hell, you're wearing a lot of bamboo."
00:38:05,00:38:11,Oh my god.
00:38:11,00:38:13,Just back to condors very quickly.
00:38:13,00:38:16,They don't eat for days because they fly and they obviously go for huge meals.
00:38:16,00:38:18,So they'll look for the carcass of a deer or whatever.
00:38:18,00:38:22,"And when they do eat, sometimes they go overboard on it, eat too much"
00:38:22,00:38:24,that they can't actually take off again.
00:38:24,00:38:25,Yeah.
00:38:25,00:38:26,So that's true?
00:38:26,00:38:29,That's how they used to catch them in like South America and stuff.
00:38:29,00:38:33,They would put like a dead horse or something on the ground or a dead animal.
00:38:33,00:38:38,And then the condors would come down and they'd eat so much that they couldn't eat anymore.
00:38:38,00:38:40,And then they won't be able to fly because they were so happy.
00:38:40,00:38:44,And then you just sort of run after them and rather than the noose and then pull them off.
00:38:44,00:38:50,"And often, like they try and fly and they throw up because they were so exhausted and so full."
00:38:50,00:38:52,Is that an evolutionary response?
00:38:52,00:38:59,Because the reason that we want to we when we get nervous is supposedly because there's a--
00:38:59,00:39:05,"I think a reptile, you know, so the evolution of the brain is that we start off with a very simple brain"
00:39:05,00:39:10,and then we get a bit of the brain that becomes like reptilian and then it becomes mammalian.
00:39:10,00:39:12,And it's basically layer on layer.
00:39:12,00:39:17,And the reason we want to we when we get nervous is you want to make yourself as light as possible
00:39:17,00:39:21,"so that when you start to run away, you can get further."
00:39:21,00:39:24,"I would think that would probably be the time of the condol, wouldn't it?"
00:39:24,00:39:28,That you throw up because you want to then you'd be lighter and then you could arguably get away.
00:39:28,00:39:34,"Oh, there's some animals that throw up so that something chasing them will eat whatever they've thrown up instead of eating them."
00:39:34,00:39:37,Diversionary vomit.
00:39:37,00:39:43,"So when eating corpses, condos always start with that eyes and tongue which is their favourite part."
00:39:43,00:39:48,"You don't know that, it might be their least favourite part and they're just getting it over with."
00:39:48,00:39:49,That's so true.
00:39:49,00:39:51,You eat your eyes and tongue young lady.
00:39:51,00:40:00,"Oh, come on, it's just in the heart."
00:40:00,00:40:02,There is a reddit thread.
00:40:02,00:40:07,"Do you prefer sex with or without a condor, which is a typo?"
00:40:07,00:40:09,That's the best typo.
00:40:09,00:40:10,Did anyone reply?
00:40:10,00:40:12,Lots of people have replied.
00:40:12,00:40:13,"Yeah, but with."
00:40:13,00:40:14,Love it.
00:40:14,00:40:19,"Okay, that's it."
00:40:19,00:40:20,That's all of our facts.
