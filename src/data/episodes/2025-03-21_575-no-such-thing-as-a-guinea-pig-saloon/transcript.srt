00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,560
 Hi everybody, Anna and Andy here. Just before this week's show, we have a little announcement

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:11,320
 to make, which is that our colleagues, Jack and Manu, have started their own podcast,

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,680
 which is about food and it's called Lunchbox Envy.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:24,120
 Yes, they have and it is, it's spicy, it's salty, it's saucy, it's sweet, it's vinegary.

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:29,160
 It's great, it's a food-based podcast jam-packed with really amazing, interesting facts about

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,000
 food that, I mean, I didn't know, we've been researching for ten years. Why our own babies

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,120
 don't just drink our blood? Do you want to know the answer to that?

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,400
 I do, I'm happy that they don't, but yeah, every episode is about a different kind of

9
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,760
 food, so they've done all sorts so far, they've done garlic and sausage and chicken. They

10
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,760
 co-host it with Rosy McKean, the pasta queen, all three of them, every week they bring something

11
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,480
 new to the table in their lunchboxes about that particular food they talk about. It's

12
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:58,160
 great fun, it's the most umami podcast I've heard for ages.

13
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,280
 Every staff and everyone who listens to it loves it, it's got five stars by 97% of listeners.

14
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,040
 It's been featured by Amazon and Apple Podcasts already. You've got to get listening for

15
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,600
 your food fix, so wherever you get your podcasts, look for Lunchbox Envy.

16
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:18,360
 All right, pack your lunch up, squash that sandwich down, give that a listen and on with

17
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,360
 the show.

18
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,360
 On with the show.

19
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:42,560
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

20
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,680
 to you from the QI offices in Hoburn. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Andrew

21
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,680
 Hunter Murray, Anna Tyshinski and James Harkin, and once again we have gathered around the

22
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,280
 microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular

23
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:03,200
 order, here we go. Starting with fact number one, that is Andy.

24
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,120
 My fact is, there's a city in Alaska where almost the entire population lives in one

25
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,120
 building.

26
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,120
 Big building?

27
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,400
 Yeah, they call it the One House Town.

28
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,400
 Very good.

29
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,400
 Very clever.

30
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,640
 I thought it was everyone, it turns out there's another tiny block of flats nearby where there's

31
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:24,600
 a little bit of overspill, which is so annoying, and if the city of Whittier, Alaska could shut

32
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,600
 that down.

33
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,600
 Yeah.

34
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,600
 One building would be a much better fact.

35
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,280
 Do we know who, is it the sort of the social rejects who live in the smaller building?

36
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,280
 Almost certainly.

37
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,280
 The people who have pissed somebody off.

38
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,400
 Actually, I found a few people who live in that second building. One of them is the mayor.

39
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,400
 Oh really?

40
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,400
 No.

41
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,280
 And another one is an artist called Brenda Tolman, who used to live in this big building,

42
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,780
 which I think is called BTI, which we'll get to in a minute, but she moved to the other

43
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:52,640
 complex because of what she called the forced socialization of this building, which is basically

44
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,560
 people will just come over in their socks and pants and just go, "Oh, how's it going?"

45
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,960
 It is pretty amazing, because there's about 300 people that live in this building.

46
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:07,480
 So that's your teachers, that's law enforcement, that's the grocers, and they do literally,

47
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,320
 if they want to hang out, just stay in the elevator, you're bound to bump into everyone,

48
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,320
 because that's your social life.

49
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,240
 And that's why I'm afraid of lifts.

50
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:18,560
 No, but rush hour in the morning is when there's a queue for every lift in the building,

51
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,080
 because everyone's getting to work, and the anyway is up and down.

52
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,080
 That's right.

53
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,320
 And work is in the building, right?

54
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,600
 Like the doctors and the shops and the school and everything you need.

55
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,080
 The school isn't in the building, the school is on the other side of the road.

56
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,240
 I don't know if you've been on Google Maps and had a look at the whole area.

57
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,520
 Yes, because don't you get to it by a tunnel, actually?

58
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,240
 So you have to go down in that building to the bottom floor, to the basement, and then

59
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,800
 you go in the little tunnel you get to the school.

60
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,960
 I half count that.

61
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,960
 Yeah.

62
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,960
 You don't have to go outside.

63
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,960
 Yeah.

64
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:52,520
 And it does sound like the school times were changed because of what Andy just said, the

65
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,320
 congestion in the elevator, you couldn't get all the kids to school in time.

66
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,880
 So they had to, yeah, everything has moved around the elevator service, basically.

67
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,520
 I've got a slight quibble.

68
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,080
 We say that they're all living in one building.

69
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,760
 I would argue it's three buildings.

70
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,760
 Uh-oh.

71
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,760
 Okay.

72
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,040
 Because it's a sort of three-tower thing, but they're joined together.

73
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,040
 Yeah, exactly.

74
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,760
 So it's actually a 20-centimeter space between three separate buildings for earthquake purposes.

75
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,840
 So they needed for it to have sway because it survived one of the greatest, most powerful

76
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,320
 earthquakes, a 9.2er.

77
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,320
 It survived.

78
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,320
 But are they joined together?

79
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,640
 Well, there's a few platings.

80
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,640
 Yes, they are.

81
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,160
 There's a few platings here joined together.

82
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,400
 And we'll retract it.

83
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,400
 Thank you.

84
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,400
 We'll deny it.

85
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,280
 And the history of it is very cool.

86
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,200
 This place was developed in the second world war as a military harbour, basically, and

87
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:43,400
 a logistics base, because it's in Alaska, so it's quite near Russia, quite near Japan.

88
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,720
 And Japan actually occupied a little bit of Alaska in the second world war, but quite

89
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,720
 near is a bit of a stretch.

90
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,720
 But you know what I mean?

91
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,720
 Relatively.

92
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,280
 It's a good bit for Japan to try and evade if they're going to go for it.

93
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,480
 So two buildings were built in the town.

94
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,040
 This one, this is opened in 1957, the BTI Tower.

95
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,360
 And they planned loads more, but they only built two in the end.

96
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:07,760
 And the other one is abandoned now, and it's just sitting there next to the one-house town.

97
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:12,200
 And it's so creepy, like it was a military base, and it was quite secret, and they had

98
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,680
 all sorts of stuff in it.

99
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,680
 The Buckner Building.

100
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,680
 The Buckner Building, exactly.

101
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,040
 And it had a theatre and a bowling alley and a library and a barbershop and a church and

102
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,040
 a rifle range.

103
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,160
 It was lovely.

104
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,640
 And then it was very quickly abandoned because it was damaged by this earthquake in 1964,

105
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,520
 the big Alaska earthquake.

106
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,440
 Sometimes people break in and ski through the corridors of that building.

107
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,440
 That's cool.

108
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,240
 Apparently one of the hazards, hibernating bears is the issue in that one.

109
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,240
 Wow.

110
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,920
 It is very snowy there, isn't it?

111
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:45,280
 Which I maybe you'd expect from Alaska generally, but I think it gets a thousand times more

112
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,680
 snow than the US average, which obviously a lot of the US doesn't get very much snow

113
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,680
 at all.

114
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,680
 There's a lot though.

115
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,680
 There's a lot.

116
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,680
 Yes.

117
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,280
 But also nicely, it's named Whittier, as you said, and it's sort of named after this

118
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,360
 poet called John Greenleaf Whittier.

119
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,560
 And well, a glacier nearby was named after him, and then it was named after the glacier.

120
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,280
 And his most famous work was about snow.

121
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,560
 I think it was called snowed in by coincidence.

122
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,560
 Oh.

123
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,560
 So there you go.

124
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,560
 That's pretty cool.

125
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,560
 That is very cool.

126
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,600
 I found a Reddit which had asked me anything by someone who lived in this building, a guy

127
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,600
 called Spankadelic.

128
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,600
 Oh, yeah.

129
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,720
 Imagine you're locked in a building and that's one of your neighbours.

130
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,320
 I would more be worried about having the next door flat for him, trying to get it asleep

131
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,320
 at night.

132
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:35,280
 Keep it down a bit, please, Spankadelic.

133
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:41,140
 So Spankadelic said, "I lived in Whittier, A.K., in a building which has the entire town

134
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:45,240
 of 200 people, ask me anything," a rainy sunbun said.

135
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,280
 So what about the sex lives?

136
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,960
 Is it mostly families who live there?

137
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:54,440
 I'd imagine everyone is just having sex with everyone, to which Spankadelic replied, "It

138
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:59,080
 was mostly families and really old people, so no, it was not like that at all."

139
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,840
 And then Hard Spank 916.

140
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,840
 What?

141
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,320
 This is a normal Reddit thread.

142
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,280
 It's not some kind of weird layer of Reddit.

143
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,800
 Is this a relation?

144
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:15,240
 Hard Spank said, "Isn't Alaska A.L. an Arkansas A.K.?" to which Spankadelic replied, "Nope.

145
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,520
 Understandable mistake, though.

146
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,520
 Nice username."

147
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,560
 That was the entire interesting bit.

148
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,560
 Wow.

149
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,560
 We had it.

150
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,120
 One of the most fascinating things about people living in this building is if they want to

151
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:35,200
 go to the major local town, Anchorage, you can only get to it via this tunnel, the Anton

152
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,260
 Anderson Memorial Tunnel.

153
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,120
 It's four kilometers long.

154
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,440
 You're not allowed to walk through it.

155
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,640
 You're not allowed to bike through it.

156
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:46,160
 It's for trains and cars only, and it shuts every night at about 10.30.

157
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,080
 So if you go to the movies, you've got to be back before 10.30, otherwise they just shut

158
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,080
 it down.

159
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,080
 That's fantastic.

160
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,280
 And you've got to sleep in your car and wait for it to open in the morning.

161
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,280
 As people do, right?

162
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,440
 There are sort of huge people who've lost it, and the tunnel doesn't seem to have been

163
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,200
 built to accommodate what it's meant for.

164
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,200
 No, it wasn't.

165
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,760
 So it was built for a train.

166
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:08,520
 It was initially, you could only get there by boat and by, when this tunnel opened by

167
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:13,200
 train, and then they adapted the tunnel in 2000 to be a road tunnel as well, but they

168
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,560
 didn't add an extra lane or anything.

169
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,640
 They just put a bit of tarmac down in between the train tracks, and so now you can either

170
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,960
 drive or get the train, and there are very strict timings, obviously, of when you're

171
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,960
 allowed to drive.

172
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,360
 And it's also one lane, isn't it?

173
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,920
 So the train's coming all the time, so every hour the direction switches.

174
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:35,480
 So you arrive there, you've got a 15-minute window, you can go through that, and then

175
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:39,320
 they have to air it out after every single line of traffic that's gone through.

176
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,320
 They've got massive fans all the way through.

177
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,820
 I give that five minutes ago.

178
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,120
 I've always wondered why they have big fans in tunnels.

179
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,120
 Can anyone tell me that?

180
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,120
 I can.

181
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,720
 It's to suck out the fumes.

182
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,040
 If you get stuck in the tunnel and the tunnel's shut down and people's car engines are on,

183
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,480
 the air can get very toxic very quickly.

184
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,920
 And so this tunnel has a few little safe house bits, and it's got huge fans to blow out the

185
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,920
 fumes.

186
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,280
 I was going back to when they were building the access tunnel, and most of them seemed

187
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,920
 to be hugely against it.

188
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:09,640
 There was a lot of protest, because they pride themselves on being this place you could not

189
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,200
 access by road, you know, we're on our own here, we don't want you.

190
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,400
 It was famous as like the real middle of nowhere city, wasn't it?

191
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,120
 And I think quite a lot of people moved there because they wanted to get away from it all.

192
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,120
 Yeah.

193
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,120
 I think you kind of hear stories of people who lived there, who said, "Yeah, I was having

194
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:29,260
 a bad time in LA, and I decided to come here instead," kind of thing.

195
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:33,600
 That earthquake in 1964, which trashed the other building, and which the main building

196
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,400
 survived, that sounds extraordinary, as in it was a lot of Alaska it hit.

197
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,520
 About 140 people were killed by it.

198
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:44,440
 I think it was the second largest earthquake in recorded history.

199
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,800
 And it was on Good Friday in 1964.

200
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,800
 Some places got 30 feet higher because of the tectonic plates.

201
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,280
 Because the ground shifted up.

202
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,280
 Yeah.

203
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,280
 Cool.

204
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,280
 And it was impressive.

205
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:58,280
 Some salmon could no longer jump up to their spawning grounds, because the cliff they had

206
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,280
 to jump up had just gone...

207
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,120
 30 feet is a long way for a salmon.

208
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,040
 No one ever thinks about the salmon in earthquakes, do they?

209
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,040
 No.

210
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,040
 And there might be another one one day.

211
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,920
 There's a receding glacier, which is 50 kilometers away, and that's destabilized a mountain

212
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,920
 side.

213
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,320
 And they think that mountain, if there's any earthquake, that mountain's going to slip

214
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,120
 and cause a tsunami.

215
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,880
 And even though it is two hours away by boat, this mountain side, it'll hit Whittier in

216
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,360
 about 20 minutes.

217
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,360
 The tsunami.

218
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,360
 Wow.

219
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,360
 Thanks.

220
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,360
 Yeah.

221
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,360
 So everyone in the tunnel.

222
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,360
 Yeah.

223
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,480
 And also the building's reaching its end of use date, really.

224
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,480
 Is it?

225
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,720
 It's what they keep saying structurally, this might be, you know, not for a very long.

226
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,720
 Interesting.

227
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,360
 You know how it's on Prince William Sound?

228
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,360
 Yeah.

229
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,360
 Well, I was...

230
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,360
 So Prince William Sound...

231
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,360
 What is a sound?

232
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,360
 What is a sound?

233
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,360
 Well, the F is a sound.

234
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,360
 I just thought...

235
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,080
 Prince William Sound is the one thing you'll never hear Prince Harry say.

236
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,080
 That's probably...

237
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,080
 Yeah.

238
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,440
 So Prince William Sound is a very important piece of water.

239
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,680
 And we should say the reason it was...

240
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,480
 The military base was put there is because it was the only non-freezing harbour.

241
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,760
 So it was really militarily important.

242
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,760
 So it doesn't freeze in the winter.

243
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,760
 It doesn't freeze over.

244
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,760
 Yeah.

245
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,240
 So it was the only place you could get boats to repel, maybe a Japanese attack and get

246
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,240
 supplies over.

247
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,240
 But yeah.

248
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,240
 I was like, what is a sound?

249
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,320
 I'm going to do everyone the favor of telling you so you don't have to wonder next time.

250
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,720
 So I bloody mentioned it.

251
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,400
 It's actually not very well defined.

252
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,360
 It's a number of options.

253
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,600
 So a narrow passage of water between a mainland and an inland or like a recessed bit of ocean,

254
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,200
 which I guess is what we all imagine.

255
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,200
 But it comes...

256
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,200
 You show big hills on each side.

257
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,200
 I always imagine.

258
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,200
 I don't know why.

259
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,200
 Yes, me too.

260
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,880
 I actually wonder if I imagine that because I imagine them being an echo because it's

261
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,880
 got the word sound.

262
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,460
 What's the most famous sound?

263
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,460
 Is it Long Island?

264
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,460
 Is there a Long Island sound?

265
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,460
 I feel like there is.

266
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,460
 I don't know.

267
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,460
 For me, it's...

268
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,460
 Is it Pudget Sound?

269
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,460
 Pudget Sound, yes.

270
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:53,840
 There are lots in Alaska, but it comes from an old Norse word, sund, which means to swim.

271
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,440
 And so it's because it was like a portion of water that you could swim across.

272
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,240
 So from one bit of land to another.

273
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,560
 And that also used to be the name for a fish's swim bladder.

274
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,960
 Do you think I could find that?

275
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,960
 You'd call it sound.

276
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,960
 That's such solid research.

277
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,960
 It's so sad I went too deep.

278
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,960
 That's really good.

279
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,960
 Do you know why Juno...

280
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,840
 You know Juno, the capital of Alaska in fact.

281
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,840
 Yes.

282
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,840
 Do you know why that's called Juno?

283
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,840
 Juno.

284
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,840
 Yeah.

285
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,840
 Exactly.

286
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,840
 I've been to Juno.

287
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,840
 You?

288
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,840
 Yeah.

289
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,840
 That's quite cool.

290
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,840
 That's...

291
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,340
 No, it's a really nice place to be.

292
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,580
 But I thought it was named after a person.

293
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,580
 It is.

294
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,300
 It's named after Joe Juno, but there's more to it.

295
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,420
 So Juno is the capital and you can't get to it by road.

296
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,100
 You can only get by boat or plane.

297
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:38,940
 And named after Joe Juno, because it was founded by him and Richard Harris, I don't think the

298
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:45,040
 actor played Dumbledore because it was in the 1880s, because they found gold there.

299
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,800
 And then a whole bunch of other people like flocked there to find gold, a guy called Rockwell

300
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:54,180
 took over and it was originally called Harrisburg after Richard Harris, because Juno was French

301
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:57,280
 Canadian so couldn't write English, so Harris was just like, "Well, I'll just write down

302
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,800
 my name then."

303
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,400
 But then there was a winter in 1881 where all the leading figures in the area left for

304
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:08,440
 winter to do other stuff, except Joe Juno, who was a man's man and kind of a really fun

305
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,440
 guy.

306
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,120
 He stayed with all the miners and he spent the entire winter in the saloons buying them

307
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,080
 all drinks throughout the winter.

308
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,640
 So at the end of that winter, the miners all took a vote amongst themselves to change the

309
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,640
 name to Juno.

310
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,640
 Wow, that is cool.

311
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:30,760
 I don't think I've said this before, they have sawdust on the floor, do you know why

312
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,360
 they have sawdust on the floor?

313
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:38,340
 To soak up spit and urine, is that not genuinely why?

314
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,340
 Unbomb it.

315
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,340
 Yeah, that's what people are doing.

316
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:44,960
 They don't have any toilets and when you ask them, they say, "Oh, just go there."

317
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:51,680
 It's a litter tray-based system.

318
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,680
 Especially all guinea pigs that live there, we so mentioned.

319
00:13:54,680 --> 00:14:01,900
 So if people drop their food, they don't act like animals and re-eat it.

320
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,280
 So it's about dropping things, think about what Anna said about why people went to Juno

321
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,280
 in the first place.

322
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:12,640
 Mine is, mine for gold, and if you drop your gold, you will lose it in the sawdust.

323
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,640
 Yes.

324
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,640
 And then, what does the owner do?

325
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,560
 Then the barman gets to sweep it up at the end of the day.

326
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,640
 Sweeps it all up, puts it in a big barrel, the sawdust floats on top of the barrel, but

327
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,640
 the gold goes to the bottom.

328
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,640
 Brilliant.

329
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,640
 Take it out.

330
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,640
 Brilliant.

331
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,640
 Is that true?

332
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,640
 That's true, yeah.

333
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,640
 That's great.

334
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,640
 That's very cool.

335
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,640
 Do you know, actually, I said there are two ways.

336
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,640
 There are three ways to get into Juno.

337
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,640
 Oh, a boat.

338
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,640
 I don't think they are.

339
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,640
 So we've got boat and plane.

340
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,640
 Yeah, boat and plane.

341
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,860
 I know there's no roads that go in because I was told that if you want to borrow someone's

342
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,640
 car, you can just ask them and they'll just let you borrow it because they don't.

343
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,640
 You can't drive that.

344
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,640
 That's okay.

345
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,640
 I was told that.

346
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,640
 I never tried it.

347
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,640
 But yeah.

348
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,640
 You're so totally, can't you?

349
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,640
 So it's not his boat.

350
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,640
 It's air.

351
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,640
 There's no road.

352
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,640
 So it's a tunnel.

353
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,640
 I'll give you a clue.

354
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,640
 It's sort of tunnel.

355
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,640
 It's a canal.

356
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,960
 But what I actually, this is just a trick question.

357
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,640
 What kind of canal?

358
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,640
 Narrowboat canal.

359
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,640
 A berth canal.

360
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,640
 You know what?

361
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,640
 I should be annoyed about that question, but I really like it.

362
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,640
 You could be gone there.

363
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:15,640
 Okay.

364
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,640
 It is time for fact number two, and that is James.

365
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,640
 Okay.

366
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:24,240
 My fact this week is that the earliest known kids birthday party included the sacrifice

367
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,360
 of a sheep.

368
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,360
 When was this?

369
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:33,240
 This was during the reign of King Lugalanda in a city called Lagash, which was in ancient

370
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,240
 Sumer.

371
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,920
 And the reason we know about it is because there are cuneiform tablets, which describe

372
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,920
 it.

373
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,800
 And there's a historian called Vladimir Emilianov, at St. Petersburg University, who studied

374
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,800
 these tablets.

375
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:50,760
 And he found that there is a mention of celebrating the births of the rulers children.

376
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:56,200
 And when they celebrated the birthdays, they sacrificed an animal and shared it with their

377
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,200
 deceased ancestors.

378
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,200
 So.

379
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,200
 Interested party bags that were left on the tune.

380
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,200
 You got a blower.

381
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,200
 A hat.

382
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,200
 A liver.

383
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,200
 So yeah.

384
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,200
 Lucky kids.

385
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,920
 Lucky little Sumerian kids.

386
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,880
 When he was taken away from power, Lugalanda, because he was quite corrupt, we kind of

387
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,600
 lose the birthday party for a while, and we don't have anything more on them until, you

388
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,600
 know.

389
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,600
 Really recently.

390
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,600
 Not really in ancient Egypt.

391
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,600
 They didn't really do it.

392
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,600
 And.

393
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:30,160
 I read that there were birthday parties in ancient Rome, but they were only for the

394
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,760
 male head of the family.

395
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,160
 So only the dad basically got a birthday party.

396
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,680
 It was incredibly unfair for the children.

397
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,680
 So funny.

398
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,000
 Herodotus wrote about the Persians celebrating their birthdays, but the fact that he was

399
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,440
 writing about the Persians and going, "Isn't this weird that they do it?" suggests that

400
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,560
 probably in the Greek and Roman world it was quite unusual.

401
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,560
 Yeah.

402
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,560
 Yeah.

403
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,560
 You might celebrate the gods.

404
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,560
 Yeah, you celebrate the gods.

405
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,560
 There's a day with the gods.

406
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,640
 Like you give Artemis a cake on her birthday.

407
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,640
 But that's not.

408
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,640
 What a waste of cake.

409
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,480
 Imagine the only time you make a cake is for a fictional being who doesn't eat it.

410
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,520
 We're just like, "How long did they sit there?"

411
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,960
 Because right now you can just go to a supermarket and buy a birthday cake, even while it's

412
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,960
 not your birthday.

413
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,960
 It's unbelievable.

414
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,960
 I think we've gone too far the other way.

415
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,960
 We have gone too far.

416
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,960
 There it is.

417
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,120
 When you put it like that, it sounds insane.

418
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,240
 There's nothing stopping you, Andy.

419
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,120
 You can do it right now, after the show.

420
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,400
 Just my programming just wouldn't let me buy a Colin the Calf Biller.

421
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:26,800
 Honestly, nothing's stopping you doing that and putting candles on it.

422
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:33,480
 The earliest surviving handwritten Latin message by a woman, quite a lot of caveats

423
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,720
 to that, was an invitation to a birthday party.

424
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,360
 It was by someone called Claudius Severa.

425
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,400
 It was found at Hadrian's Wall, in fact, in the first century, almost 2000 years ago.

426
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,760
 She was the wife of an officer and she was inviting her friend, Leppardina, to her party.

427
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,240
 She said, "On the 11th of September, please come.

428
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,840
 I give you a warm invitation to make sure you come to us.

429
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,760
 To make the day more enjoyable for me by your arrival."

430
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:04,200
 It's pretty amazing because that is the oldest now date that we have for a birthday party

431
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,720
 and it happened about 100 AD, right?

432
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,840
 But on top of it, it's September the 11th as the birthday party.

433
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,440
 We can't necessarily assume that was her actual birthday, but that's when the party

434
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,440
 was.

435
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,440
 It might have been the weekend.

436
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,440
 It might have been the weekend, exactly.

437
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,440
 You have it.

438
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,940
 I don't want to assume.

439
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,880
 Everyone at the party will have asked it in Latin.

440
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,880
 Is it today?

441
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,640
 No, it was Thursday.

442
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,160
 But that date is almost bang on for when the most popular birthdays tend to be.

443
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,360
 September the 16th comes out most likely, but if you look at the top 10 most likely

444
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,480
 dates of birthdays, they're all September.

445
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,600
 Because people have sex when it's cold and dark and off his parties and stuff.

446
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,460
 And then nine months later.

447
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:44,160
 But so that's the birthday of the birthday, isn't it, really?

448
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,160
 Exactly.

449
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:49,680
 But unfortunately, it's September 11th, so I thought we could really do a massive party.

450
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,080
 No, for the world.

451
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:57,760
 In Europe, I think you wouldn't have birthdays until the 19th century was sort of like proper

452
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,760
 birthday parties.

453
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,920
 Not really.

454
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,200
 And there are loads of theories as to why.

455
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,720
 So in the 19th century, you everyone had 18 children and it's exhausting celebrating

456
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,720
 them all.

457
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,860
 When that started to come down a bit, you've got two or three children, you think, okay,

458
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,760
 fine, we can do birthdays now.

459
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,760
 Where's one theory?

460
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,760
 Yeah.

461
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,480
 And also there's a big change because it used to be name days.

462
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,480
 So I love this.

463
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,120
 A day used to be every name, every common name would have a day.

464
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,520
 And it's normally a saint's day.

465
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,560
 So Saint James's day or Saint Anna's day.

466
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,560
 Still that in some countries.

467
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,560
 Yeah.

468
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,560
 In Greece, for sure.

469
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:30,320
 Like my brother-in-law is Greek and he celebrates his name day.

470
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,320
 There you go.

471
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:35,840
 And so I think the theory is, everyone knows, oh, it's Saint Christopher's day.

472
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,800
 So if your name is Christopher, you get a lot more attention from strangers.

473
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,320
 They say, oh, people who know your name but don't know much about you, they say, oh,

474
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,960
 happy, happy, some Christopher's day is your name day.

475
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,960
 So you get more kind of general attention.

476
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,200
 Actually, I just remember we did that at primary school.

477
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,200
 Really?

478
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,200
 Yeah.

479
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,200
 Yeah.

480
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,200
 We went to a Catholic school.

481
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,200
 There we go.

482
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,200
 We'd all have a name day, wouldn't we?

483
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,200
 With our four names.

484
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,200
 Yeah.

485
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,200
 We would.

486
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,200
 Yes.

487
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,200
 And there are rare names, obviously.

488
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,200
 If your name is really unusual.

489
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,200
 I can't think of any unusual names now.

490
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,200
 You couldn't think of one.

491
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,200
 Could you?

492
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,200
 You couldn't think of one.

493
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,200
 Cersei.

494
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,200
 Cersei.

495
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,200
 Brilliant.

496
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,680
 If your name is Cersei, there is a tradition in some places like Latvia where the 22nd of

497
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,400
 May is the name day for people who don't have a name day.

498
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,400
 Oh, that's good.

499
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,400
 In a normal calendar.

500
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,400
 That's nice.

501
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,200
 So, they celebrated birthdays when they were being brought in.

502
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,200
 Pagan, isn't it?

503
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,200
 It's Pagan.

504
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,200
 Name days are saintly.

505
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,200
 That's proper.

506
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,200
 Yeah.

507
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,200
 And birthdays were a bit...

508
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,520
 Another reason they came in in kind of industrial revolution time is because dates and times

509
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,360
 became important, whereas they didn't used to be.

510
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,520
 So people started having clocks and we started knowing what date it was.

511
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,160
 And people had calendars that, you know, the printing had become much bigger so people

512
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,280
 could have calendars in their houses.

513
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,440
 And until then, you would be, you know, what's it like outside now at time of recording?

514
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,440
 It was the start of spring.

515
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,800
 And you just know it was the start of spring.

516
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,760
 You wouldn't necessarily know that it was the 5th of March or April.

517
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,760
 Yeah.

518
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,760
 No one knew what their birthday was, probably.

519
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,760
 No.

520
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,760
 Have you guys heard?

521
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,760
 There's a tradition in Germany.

522
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,760
 And birthdays are quite big in Germany.

523
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,760
 A lot of offices will have a birthday calendar in the kitchen.

524
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,480
 Oh, and you can't, under any circumstances, wish someone a happy birthday in advance.

525
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,480
 Very bad luck.

526
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,480
 That is bad luck in a few cultures.

527
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,480
 I completely agree.

528
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,080
 I say happy new year when it comes.

529
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,640
 People start throwing around happy new year on the 28th of December.

530
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,640
 I shut that down.

531
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,640
 Do you?

532
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,640
 Well, yeah.

533
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,640
 How do we know the new year is going to come?

534
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,640
 We're just going to get around.

535
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,640
 Well, that's the thing.

536
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,080
 In Russia, if you wish someone's happy birthday before the birthday, then the idea is that

537
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,320
 they'll die before the birthday.

538
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,320
 Yeah.

539
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,320
 It's just a fool's errand doing that.

540
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,480
 You think the earth will explode when someone says that to you.

541
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,480
 I'm not saying it will.

542
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,480
 I'm saying let's not take the risk.

543
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,480
 But there is a tradition.

544
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,480
 Please write it if you're German listening to this, and this is real.

545
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,960
 In the north and west of Germany, if you have a birthday after the age of 30, but you're

546
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:40,440
 an unmarried man, there's a tradition that you have to sweep the steps of your town hall

547
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,840
 dressed as a woman until you are kissed by a virgin.

548
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,680
 I don't think that happens.

549
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,680
 It can't do.

550
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,360
 It feels like we'd know about it, wouldn't we, if everyone was doing that.

551
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,120
 Like, Germany's a serious industrial life country.

552
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,000
 There simply isn't the time for people to take time off to do this.

553
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,660
 But it's a good way of finding love, I suppose, you know, if you don't want to go on the

554
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:00,660
 apps.

555
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,660
 Oh, my goodness.

556
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:07,280
 Germans, yes, big into birthdays, big into child's birthdays, big into childhood.

557
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,520
 I feel like Germany invented childhood in the kinder in the late 18th century.

558
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:17,520
 And in fact, the earliest birthday celebration I could find in Germany was in 1801, and it

559
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:23,480
 was Goethe describing it of, you know, Germany's answer to Shakespeare fame and friend of the

560
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,480
 podcast.

561
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,160
 And he was describing the birthday cake of Prince August of Saxgotha Altenberg.

562
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:34,160
 And he described it as a generous talk with colorful flaming candles amounting to 50 candles,

563
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,140
 which was for how old he was.

564
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:40,720
 So that's like the first time we have, you've got the number of candles to go with your

565
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,000
 age on a cake.

566
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 But he said that was weird, because usually in children's festivities of this kind, you

567
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,960
 have a number of candles indicating your upcoming years.

568
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:55,200
 Oh, and I found a couple of others also saying the candles on the cake would be the number

569
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,520
 of years you're estimated to have.

570
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,960
 But life expectancy in those days was quite low, wasn't it?

571
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,360
 So you didn't have to blow out as many, yeah.

572
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,720
 It must have been a bit of a shock, wouldn't it?

573
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,520
 You see the cake coming out of the kitchen.

574
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,820
 Why are there only four candles on there?

575
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:08,820
 Wow, that's amazing.

576
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,820
 I know, I know.

577
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,820
 Omniscient.

578
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,780
 You've always got to guess.

579
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,780
 Birthday songs.

580
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,900
 There's obviously a happy birthday song.

581
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,940
 What would you say is the most famous other birthday party song?

582
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,540
 Happy birthday to your shawty.

583
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,540
 It's your birthday.

584
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,540
 Okay.

585
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,540
 There's so many.

586
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,540
 I wasn't expecting that.

587
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,700
 It's my party and I cry if I want to.

588
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,700
 Leslie Gore.

589
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,700
 Leslie Gore.

590
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,700
 Incredible song.

591
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,700
 Gorgeous song.

592
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:35,720
 And so I'd never properly, I know the chorus never properly listened to the lyrics.

593
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,840
 It's about the singer Leslie Gore in the story.

594
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,840
 She is at a party.

595
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,840
 We should say 60s singer.

596
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,840
 Yeah.

597
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,840
 People who haven't heard of her these days.

598
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,840
 Yeah.

599
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,840
 Brilliant singer.

600
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,840
 She's a brilliant singer.

601
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,340
 And I'll cry if I want to.

602
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,340
 Exactly.

603
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,340
 And she was about 14 when that came out.

604
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,340
 She was so young.

605
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,340
 She was so young.

606
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:54,860
 And so the story is about her boyfriend, Johnny, disappearing from her birthday party, comes

607
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:59,640
 back with a girl called Judy and she's wearing his ring and it's this whole horrible thing,

608
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,640
 right?

609
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,640
 Did it really happen to Leslie?

610
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,640
 Yeah.

611
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,900
 It kind of happened to one of the songwriters, but it was his daughter being upset that her

612
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,520
 grandparents had been invited to the party and she was crying.

613
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,720
 And then he turned it into a more of a love triangle thing.

614
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,720
 Okay.

615
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,720
 Here's the interesting thing though.

616
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:17,420
 There was a sequel to that song called Judy's Turn to Cry.

617
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:23,620
 And so it's a follow on where Johnny then sees Leslie Gore kissing someone at that party

618
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:26,460
 and he gets jealous and he punches the guy and he goes back.

619
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,940
 Dan, can I get, can I show you guys something on my phone?

620
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:29,940
 Yeah.

621
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,940
 Yeah.

622
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:34,780
 So Andy's gone over to the cell for, he's pulled out some what sits and it's not that

623
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,280
 that he needs.

624
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:40,360
 He's pulled out, what's that, some greens of some sort up there's his phone.

625
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,360
 Okay.

626
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,040
 If this is just you on holiday last week, then you've got to save it.

627
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,920
 This series of phone isn't me crying.

628
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:49,360
 No, I have this album on my phone.

629
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,560
 I'm a big fan and she released an entire album of crying based songs off the back of this

630
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,560
 hit.

631
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,560
 Oh, wow.

632
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,560
 I'll cry if I want to.

633
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:00,240
 The tracks are Cry Me a River, Cry, Just Let Me Cry.

634
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,100
 Cry and You Cry Alone, No More Tears, Judy's Turn to Cry.

635
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,100
 Yep.

636
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,100
 I understand.

637
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,100
 I would.

638
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,100
 Misty, probably about crying.

639
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,100
 What kind of fool am I?

640
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,100
 And the party's over.

641
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:13,760
 Andy, is this your Spotify raps every year?

642
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,760
 It's a cracking album.

643
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,100
 But it is amazing that they basically went, this single is such a hit.

644
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,900
 You are now our cry singer.

645
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:20,900
 Yeah.

646
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,900
 And let's do a whole album of it.

647
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,900
 Yeah.

648
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:26,260
 And then there must have been a shift because there was one song which you mentioned there

649
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:29,660
 on that album, which is what kind of fool am I?

650
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,660
 Oh yeah.

651
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:34,520
 So her follow-up album, that was clearly a hit, is basically songs would fall in the

652
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,520
 title.

653
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,240
 She's a fool.

654
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,240
 My foolish heart.

655
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,240
 She's latching onto the wrong thing.

656
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,240
 Young foolish.

657
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,920
 You haven't got a number one because of the vocabulary you've used in your title.

658
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,440
 And Quincy Jones was the producer, which is why it's such an amazing sound.

659
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,600
 But yeah, what an amazing story.

660
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,040
 It's like a diss track sequel.

661
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,040
 It's so strange.

662
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,840
 She's the Kendrick Lamar of her own day, of her own song.

663
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,840
 I don't get that.

664
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,840
 Okay.

665
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,840
 And it's more of a Drake fan.

666
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:01,020
 I feel like we haven't innovated any birthday stuff, our generation.

667
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,500
 We've not moved the birthday along at all.

668
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,540
 Oh, well, your generation hasn't, but what's your favorite birthday game?

669
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,340
 I don't really have any favorite birthday games.

670
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,340
 Just name it one.

671
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,340
 Pass the Barter.

672
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,340
 Pass the Barter.

673
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,340
 It's both rubbish.

674
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:14,120
 I like the one where you go through the Times birthday announcements guessing the age of

675
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,200
 the celebrities and public figures whose birthdays are listed in that.

676
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,780
 What, the Richard Osmond birthday game?

677
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,500
 I do play that daily.

678
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:26,820
 Well, like I said, if you ask most adults, 67% of people will say that past the past

679
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:32,520
 was one of their favorite party games and 61% will say musical chairs.

680
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:36,200
 But in young children today, or in fact, this was 10 years ago.

681
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:42,480
 So this was a study in 2009, 31% of children age four to seven said they liked past the

682
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,240
 parcel and only 19% said they liked musical chairs.

683
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,280
 And they said that their favorite was playing the Nintendo Wii and the Sony PlayStation.

684
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,280
 I'm with them.

685
00:26:53,280 --> 00:27:04,580
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Anna.

686
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:08,260
 My fact this week is that saffron was invented by humans.

687
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,500
 I thought this is really interesting.

688
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:15,780
 I didn't know that saffron is in the very expensive spice that we can eat.

689
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:20,140
 Cannot grow in the wild at all, it cannot reproduce without humans intervening.

690
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,700
 So it's all propagated, harvested manually.

691
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:26,960
 And that's been the case for thousands of years, and there's no wild equivalent.

692
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,840
 There's something that people call wild saffron, which we think maybe it originally came from

693
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,320
 a mutation of that.

694
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:39,280
 But basically about 4,000 years ago, maybe in Crete, maybe in Persia, some people, I

695
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:44,680
 guess, found a mutated wild crocus and then tried hand breeding it with another one.

696
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,040
 And it came up with saffron.

697
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:50,660
 And then since then for 4,000 years, we've been having to hand pollinate or hand breed

698
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,660
 saffron.

699
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,660
 Is that the thing?

700
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,780
 It doesn't make seeds, yes.

701
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:59,720
 So it all has to be propagated with the bulb, which blossoms into lots of little bits underground.

702
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,220
 It's called a quorum, isn't it?

703
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,220
 A quorum, yes.

704
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,780
 It's like a bulb, but it's basically, it's very similar to a bulb.

705
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:09,940
 And they grow little offshoots, and you just pinch those off for replanting.

706
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,940
 But yeah, is this why it's so expensive?

707
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:12,940
 Yes.

708
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,100
 Yeah, it's quite labor-intensive, isn't it?

709
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:18,040
 Having to dig up every saffron bit, pluck some quorms off, replant them.

710
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,060
 And also because you need a lot of flowers to get not much saffron running.

711
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,060
 There's shed loads.

712
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:27,020
 Each one grows three of these little bits, which are basically the stigma, the stigma

713
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,420
 of the female bit of a plant.

714
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,500
 That's what the red threads are.

715
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,700
 Each one has three of them.

716
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:36,620
 It needs 200,000 flowers to produce one kilogram of dried saffron threads.

717
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:40,620
 And 200,000 flowers is the same as the entire number of flowers used at the World Cup of

718
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:43,540
 Florets in Manchester in 2023.

719
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,540
 That puts it into perspective.

720
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:48,660
 Well, it was the hundredth year of the competition, which is like...

721
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,660
 You don't need to tell me, Jax.

722
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:53,940
 And of course, like, being a World Cup, the Germans won.

723
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:54,940
 Oh, really?

724
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:55,940
 Yeah, yeah.

725
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,340
 It's an amazing process.

726
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,340
 It's so weird.

727
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,340
 It's so weird.

728
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,340
 And very time-consuming.

729
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:04,980
 So you hand-pick the flowers, and then you pick out the three bright red threads.

730
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:10,020
 And then you dry them out, and then they lose about 80% of their weight in the drying process.

731
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,780
 So you've got almost nothing left of them.

732
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:16,900
 And then you press those threads into a cake, I believe, or you can do, to pack it.

733
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,900
 Oh, right.

734
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,900
 Yeah.

735
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,300
 But like, quite often, you'll just buy them.

736
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:24,060
 If you go to a souk in Morocco or something, they'll just be a little sort of...

737
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,500
 It's almost like a petri dish with the men.

738
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,500
 Yeah.

739
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,500
 Have you heard of bastard saffron?

740
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,500
 Oh.

741
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:35,060
 Bastard saffron is fake saffron, which obviously is very profitable, because even if you're

742
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:40,220
 selling it cheaper than saffron, it can be ground petals of calendula or safflower.

743
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,380
 So they look a bit similar, I suppose.

744
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:45,420
 Maybe you had in some beef fibres or bits of Brazil nuts.

745
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,420
 Also quite expensive, actually.

746
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,420
 Yes.

747
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,580
 But it's not cheap.

748
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:53,240
 And then you store it in a damp location, and it gains a bit of weight, sort of absorbs

749
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,740
 a bit of water from the air.

750
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:55,740
 It does end up looking...

751
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,740
 Does it taste like saffron?

752
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,740
 No.

753
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:58,740
 Even though beef fibres are contributing to the saffron?

754
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,740
 No.

755
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:00,740
 You're being swizzed.

756
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,740
 Yeah.

757
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:04,220
 But Pliny recommends two methods to identify whether or not something's real saffron.

758
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:08,780
 One, you press the threads, and if they crackle, then it's not saffron.

759
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:12,380
 And secondly, you touch it on your face, and if it is saffron, it'll sting you a tiny

760
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,380
 bit.

761
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,380
 And is this true?

762
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,380
 Yeah.

763
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,380
 Oh.

764
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,380
 It's not true.

765
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,380
 He also said it was an aphrodisiac.

766
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,380
 Is it not?

767
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,380
 No.

768
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,380
 Nothing is.

769
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,380
 Everything's claimed, and nothing is.

770
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,380
 Well, they say, yeah.

771
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:27,420
 So the famous thing that will be mentioned is Cleopatra would use saffron-infused baths

772
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:30,580
 to sort of get her loins going and get into it.

773
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,180
 Did she not have baths of milk, Cleopatra?

774
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:35,300
 She did, with saffron, also as part of it, yeah.

775
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,620
 I thought something that was really interesting about a saffron was just how unbelievably

776
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,780
 widespread it is in meals across the world.

777
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:44,780
 Like, it doesn't seem to have a country or a region or even a continent that it's fixed

778
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,780
 to.

779
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:52,020
 So we've managed paella, Indian dishes in South America now and European dishes, and

780
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,940
 we seem to have been using it for ages.

781
00:30:53,940 --> 00:31:00,140
 It's reached us about 2,000 years ago in Britain even, and we even have saffron-waldon,

782
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:05,500
 the place, which is named after it, and that was back in the 16th century.

783
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,740
 It's in Essex, isn't it?

784
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,740
 Yes.

785
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:13,700
 And they changed the town seal to a picture of three saffron plants surrounded by a wall

786
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,340
 because saffron walled in.

787
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,340
 Oh, nice.

788
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,340
 Very nice.

789
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,340
 It was called something else, walled in before.

790
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,900
 It was called magna-waldon.

791
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:21,900
 Magna-waldon.

792
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,780
 And they're also known for their lavender in saffron.

793
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,780
 Really?

794
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:32,140
 Yeah, Ian Lavender, who played Pike on Dead's Army, is listed as a notable resident in this

795
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,140
 time.

796
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:35,220
 Saffron growers, croakers, called croakers.

797
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:37,380
 Oh, because a saffron is a type of crocus.

798
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,380
 Because it's a type of crocus?

799
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,380
 Is that why they're getting it?

800
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,380
 I assume that's where it came from.

801
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:44,740
 They were known as the worst complainers of two-to-times.

802
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:47,500
 Because of the labour-intensiveness of the work?

803
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,500
 Basically, they were always complaining about the price.

804
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:53,740
 It was written in a book about the table on a history of food, and it said, "The croakers,

805
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,340
 if the yield's too big, they complain.

806
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:58,380
 If the yield's too small, they complain that they can't grow enough."

807
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:01,180
 I see, because if the yield's too big, then the price goes down.

808
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,180
 Exactly.

809
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,540
 If the yield's too small, then they just don't have anything to sell.

810
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,540
 Exactly.

811
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:09,420
 And so much so that by the 19th century, the word "croaker" was a word for a grumbler

812
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,420
 or a moaner.

813
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,420
 Really?

814
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,420
 Brilliant.

815
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,420
 Don't be a croaker, mate.

816
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,420
 Can I tell you about a complaining croaker?

817
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,420
 Yeah.

818
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:18,540
 This is from 1556, and it's about saffron walden.

819
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:24,040
 Such was the plenty of saffron in this year that the murmuring croakers envying the store

820
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:30,560
 said in blasphemous manner in and about walden in Essex that, "God did now shite saffron."

821
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:34,060
 That's good.

822
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:41,980
 The colour saffron, always like an orange colour, is on the flag of India, and it denotes disinterestedness.

823
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:42,980
 What?

824
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:43,980
 Yeah.

825
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:44,980
 Why?

826
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:51,140
 It's because the leaders of India must be indifferent to material gains and dedicate themselves

827
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,140
 to their work.

828
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:55,700
 So, wait, is the saffron representing material gains or the work?

829
00:32:55,700 --> 00:33:00,220
 It's because it's so labour-intensive to pick saffron that you need to be dedicated in

830
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:04,500
 order to pick that saffron, and you dedicate yourself to your work instead of material

831
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,500
 gains.

832
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,500
 That makes sense.

833
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,500
 That's very cool.

834
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,300
 Do you know what a saffron massages?

835
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:12,540
 It feels like one could guess.

836
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,540
 It's expensive.

837
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,540
 It's expensive.

838
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:16,620
 You tickle someone with those little saffron heads.

839
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:21,940
 You get massaged in three very specific spots as if they were plucking the three logs out.

840
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:22,940
 Interesting.

841
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:26,620
 When I tell you what it is, you can decide yourself who was closest.

842
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:32,540
 It's another word for what we would call scissoring between two lesbians, and it was written

843
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:39,980
 by 13th century Tunisian poet Shahib Aldin Ahmed Al-Tafashi, who was writing about lesbianism

844
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:45,860
 in the 13th century, North Africa, and he wrote about this community headed by a woman

845
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,900
 named Rose who was all doing this saffron massage.

846
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,900
 What?

847
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,180
 The saffron massage?

848
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:56,220
 So it's just, maybe it's because two legs look like one when you've got the four legs

849
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,220
 together.

850
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,220
 So it looks like a three legged thing.

851
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,220
 It could be.

852
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,220
 You know what?

853
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:05,860
 I could have worked out for all my googling, exactly where this came from.

854
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:10,300
 But I can tell you that the ancient medieval Arabic term for lesbians was Suhaqiyat, which

855
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,300
 meant rubbers.

856
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,300
 Really?

857
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,820
 People who rub things together.

858
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,540
 Oh, that makes sense.

859
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:20,220
 And it was believed that lesbianism was due to a hot itch in the genitals that could only

860
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:22,540
 be cured by rubbing clitoris to clitoris.

861
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:27,100
 Can't hold that.

862
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:33,020
 The idea was that heterosexual sex created a hot orgasm and lesbian sex produced a cold

863
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,100
 orgasm.

864
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:37,620
 And so the cold would be against the hot itch and that would cure it.

865
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,620
 Oh, okay.

866
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:42,500
 Whatever you've got to tell yourself, tell the police.

867
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,500
 And your husband.

868
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,500
 Yeah.

869
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:49,500
 Well, on the, just running on the sexual theme for a second, in 1967, saffron had quite a

870
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:54,380
 big moment in America as a result of Donovan and a song called Mellow Yellow.

871
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,380
 Off.

872
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,380
 Yeah.

873
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,380
 Back to Mandy's.

874
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,380
 Let me take out my Donovan.

875
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,380
 Yeah, yeah.

876
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,380
 Donovan, it's back to you.

877
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,380
 Go on, Mellow Yellow.

878
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,380
 It's a great song.

879
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,380
 Yeah, absolutely awesome.

880
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:07,020
 Well, there's a line that opens it, which is I'm just mad about saffron.

881
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,540
 Saffron's mad about me.

882
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:12,540
 And no one knew at the time if he was talking about the spice, if he was talking about a

883
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:17,100
 woman who was called saffron, there was a rumour went around that it was smoking banana

884
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,100
 skin.

885
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:21,780
 And that's sort of like, yeah, getting off on that.

886
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:27,140
 Mellow Yellow actually appears in one of James Joyce's books, Ulysses.

887
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:29,540
 It's a description of Molly Bloom's buttocks.

888
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,780
 So that's what Mellow Yellow is.

889
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:31,780
 Wow.

890
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,460
 So he describes her buttocks as Mellow Yellow.

891
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,980
 And then it's coincidence that there was a thought.

892
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:38,660
 I think that's a coincidence because he doesn't, I don't think he said that that's why.

893
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:42,980
 But what he says is where he got the idea for the song was when he saw an advert for a

894
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:48,380
 yellow vibrator and there was the line, electrical banana is going to be a sudden craze.

895
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,860
 And so yeah, Mellow Yellow is...

896
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,340
 Well, that's the line of the song, isn't it?

897
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,340
 Yeah.

898
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,100
 So then he came up with Mellow Yellow because he thought that was a good description of

899
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,700
 what this vibrator might achieve for you, a Mellow Yellow.

900
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:59,740
 I think in most of these cases, it's just Mellow Rives with Yellow.

901
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,740
 Yeah.

902
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:01,740
 Exactly.

903
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:02,740
 It's quite a nice phrase.

904
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,740
 And it's just floating a lot of theories here.

905
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:04,740
 I don't even know.

906
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:05,740
 Yeah.

907
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:06,740
 I'm just saying what people have thought.

908
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,620
 But saffron got a moment off the back of it.

909
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,620
 Did it?

910
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,620
 Did it sales?

911
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:11,620
 Do we have it sales?

912
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,620
 Sort of rocket skyrocketed.

913
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:15,260
 The croakers were furious.

914
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:18,780
 You know that gardening books used to rhyme.

915
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,980
 So this is really good.

916
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:23,700
 I was reading about instructions of how you plant saffron and how you grow it.

917
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:28,060
 And there's a 1440s book, The Feet of Gardening, which is by John Gardner.

918
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,060
 Very nice.

919
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,060
 Very lovely.

920
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:32,060
 So here's an example.

921
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:36,140
 With a dibble, thou shall them set, that the dibble before be blunt and gret.

922
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:40,420
 Three inches deep they must set be, and thus master John Gardner said to me.

923
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,500
 Was he Indian?

924
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,540
 No, no, no.

925
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:47,340
 What was that accent there?

926
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,340
 It was such a weird one.

927
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,340
 It was old-timey.

928
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,340
 So you're holding this.

929
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,340
 That's old.

930
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,340
 Old ancient Syrian.

931
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,940
 So you put your dibble in the ground, which makes a hole.

932
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:55,940
 It's like a log stick, right?

933
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:56,940
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

934
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:57,940
 And it has to be three inches.

935
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:02,540
 And basically it's for people who are not literate to remember gardening instructions

936
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,540
 is better.

937
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,540
 That's great.

938
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,860
 A big faff writing the books though, isn't it?

939
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:06,860
 Oh, yeah.

940
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:10,260
 If you can't make the rhyme work, then you just have to tell people to plant everything

941
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,260
 in December.

942
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:13,460
 And it's just as a nightmare.

943
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:16,420
 I think so many months' rhyme with December on.

944
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:18,940
 I think the words are wrong.

945
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:19,940
 Sorry.

946
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:24,260
 That's the worst gardening writer, 15th century multidontist.

947
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,860
 I can't think of a rhyme for November.

948
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:30,940
 Is that why no oranges were grown in that period as well?

949
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:31,940
 Yeah.

950
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:38,580
 Users of saffron in the old days, saffron in breast milk is good for eye complaints.

951
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:41,580
 According to him.

952
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:42,580
 Perverts.

953
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:45,420
 Good for seasickness.

954
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,420
 Great for plague.

955
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:48,620
 It really perks you up if you've got plague.

956
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:52,220
 Nones would send their veils with saffron to perk themselves up a bit, apparently.

957
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,220
 Okay.

958
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,220
 But there's also this thing.

959
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,380
 Have you heard of a philosopher's egg?

960
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,380
 I know.

961
00:37:56,380 --> 00:38:01,620
 So you get an egg, make a hole in the top, take out the stuff, and then you fill the

962
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:06,820
 shell with saffron, then you roast the shell and the saffron together in charcoal's until

963
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,500
 the shell becomes yellow.

964
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:12,300
 Then you beat it all together in a mortar with some mustard seed.

965
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:17,940
 Then you, as soon as any suspicion is had of infection, dissolve the weight of a French

966
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:23,020
 crown of that stuff in 10 spoonfuls of posset ale, drink it lukewarm and sweat upon it in

967
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:25,500
 your naked bed, and then you become immortal.

968
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,340
 Isn't that good?

969
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,340
 That's good.

970
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:32,060
 Is the idea that they just make it so complicated that if you die, they're like, "Oh, I just

971
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,060
 didn't do it right."

972
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,060
 Yeah, exactly.

973
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:35,060
 Yeah.

974
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:38,460
 And then nine spoonfuls of posset ale.

975
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:41,200
 Put one extra candle on it.

976
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,300
 Ancient Egyptians used saffron.

977
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,460
 They used them in their head cones.

978
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:49,340
 I wasn't really familiar with these ancient Egyptian head cones, but they're very cool.

979
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,900
 Like a dunce's cap?

980
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:53,460
 It's sort of a more sexy version of a dunce's cap.

981
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:56,060
 What could be more sexy than a dunce's cap?

982
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,060
 Come on.

983
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,380
 Let's get in the corner of the room together.

984
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:00,380
 Okay.

985
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,380
 Face the wall.

986
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:09,260
 It's not here anymore about your Catholic school days, James.

987
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:17,300
 That's what I say when I want the D. I'm referring to the letter on the code.

988
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:20,340
 This was head cones that were scented.

989
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:25,380
 So there are lots of images in tombs of people entering parties wearing these cones.

990
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:29,380
 Or you'd actually go to a party as an ancient Egyptian, if you're a posh one, and you'd

991
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:32,660
 be given a head cone, a bit like being given a cocktail or a canapé at the start.

992
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:38,580
 You'd be given a head cone, which was made of ox tallow, which was a sort of fax-y wax,

993
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:42,860
 infused with saffron, and over the course of the evening, the heat of your body would melt

994
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:43,860
 it gradually.

995
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:47,380
 So, and as it ran down your face, you'd emit the scent of saffron.

996
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,380
 It's so weird.

997
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,380
 Yeah.

998
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,380
 It's incredible.

999
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,380
 That's bizarre.

1000
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,380
 Delicious.

1001
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:53,380
 I've never heard of that before.

1002
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:54,380
 Who doesn't like the smell of beef-jipping?

1003
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,380
 Come on.

1004
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,380
 I mean, I'm from the North.

1005
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,380
 So obviously I do like that.

1006
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,380
 And that's who they were targeting.

1007
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,380
 People from Bolton.

1008
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,380
 And everyone gets one.

1009
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:03,380
 Everyone at the party, I think, gets one.

1010
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,380
 Yeah.

1011
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,380
 You'd have a servant come up and pop your head.

1012
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,380
 Oh, I'm sorry.

1013
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,380
 I'm doing non-beefy January, I'm afraid.

1014
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:13,380
 You have a vegan cone.

1015
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:17,380
 OK.

1016
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:21,060
 It is time for our final fact of the show, and that is my fact.

1017
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:27,340
 My fact this week is that in order to achieve tears in a scene, actors are often shot in

1018
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,580
 the face with a crying stick.

1019
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,580
 OK.

1020
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:35,740
 Why don't they get our Andy Spotify playlist?

1021
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:42,260
 So I saw this in quite a few places now, where it's a behind-the-scenes trick of the trade,

1022
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:46,500
 whereby if an actor needs to cry in a scene, but they can't force themselves to bring up

1023
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:51,780
 real tears, you have a few methods available to you, one of which is this crying stick,

1024
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:59,620
 which you point at the eye of someone and you blow a sort of methanol odor into their

1025
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,620
 eye.

1026
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,620
 Mental.

1027
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,620
 Sorry, sorry.

1028
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,620
 Mental.

1029
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:04,620
 Ah!

1030
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:05,620
 Well, it's just crying.

1031
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,620
 OK.

1032
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:09,460
 Can you tile it down a bit?

1033
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:16,580
 So why did your crying stick business get a blast at?

1034
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,580
 OK.

1035
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,580
 Mental.

1036
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:21,660
 And it creates tears.

1037
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:26,420
 And it's quite nice because it's not immediate tears, they sort of arrive, I guess, once

1038
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:30,460
 the director would say action, they sort of gradually appear, and so you can probably

1039
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:31,460
 time it perfectly.

1040
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,700
 So what you're talking about there is a tear-blower, I think.

1041
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:34,700
 Yeah.

1042
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:40,020
 So there's the crylon 3000 tear-blower, Nigel Beauty's Metfol tear-blower that are available

1043
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:44,820
 if you go to specialist shops, but there's also a tear-stick, which is basically like

1044
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:49,020
 a lipstick thing, which you kind of rub on your eyes and does the same job, but doesn't

1045
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,020
 have the blower.

1046
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:51,660
 So you don't put it on your bottom eyelid, actually.

1047
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:55,860
 Don't put it on your eye because there's different methods, aren't there?

1048
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:56,940
 Oh, there are so many.

1049
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:02,260
 The craziest one that I read is that stage actors, they'll keep a pair of tweezers on

1050
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:08,260
 them and they will pull a nostril hair out on both sides in order to get both eyes crying.

1051
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:10,140
 Just a good beefy tug on those, that'll do.

1052
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,140
 Yeah.

1053
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:13,980
 Kate Grandchette talks about this, she says on stage that would be a method that you would

1054
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:14,980
 do.

1055
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:15,980
 Absolutely.

1056
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:16,980
 Does it work, really?

1057
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:19,580
 Because I feel like I've tried that, but if I feel like it's mentioned in a sitcom,

1058
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,580
 I've tried it.

1059
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,220
 Does that make your eyes water?

1060
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:23,220
 I've never tried it.

1061
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:25,380
 If you get a good old deep-rooted one, it works, alright.

1062
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,380
 OK.

1063
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:30,180
 In fact, a lot of great actors will have a tiny piece of thread going to the front row of

1064
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:33,660
 the stalls where a member of the production company will be sitting, so they don't have

1065
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:34,660
 to pluck it themselves.

1066
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:35,660
 OK, yeah.

1067
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,660
 And at a certain moment, they'll just give a yank on the rod.

1068
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:39,660
 That does feel like the problem with a lot of these, right?

1069
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:43,420
 If you are doing a play, for instance, having to have someone sprint on with a crying stick

1070
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:45,780
 and blow in your face halfway through the scene.

1071
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:46,780
 Yeah, exactly.

1072
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:47,940
 Or it's also filmed in a long shot.

1073
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:52,420
 It feels like it will be very hard to puff a blow of mental into your eye from a distance.

1074
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,420
 Yeah.

1075
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:56,620
 That's the reason that the stick is quite useful, because you can sort of hide it about

1076
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:58,580
 your person and then just shove it in there.

1077
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:00,100
 Well also, how many nostril hairs do you have?

1078
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:02,860
 If you're in a long-running play, that is...

1079
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:03,860
 They regrow.

1080
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:08,060
 And as you get older, more and more, they regrow more quickly.

1081
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:11,940
 My friend, Diva, who's an actor, she said that she had a friend who would ask you to

1082
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:15,900
 list anything bad that had happened to you in your life, and they would read it and they

1083
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:18,020
 would use that to make them cry.

1084
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:19,860
 They'd read it to the person who created the list.

1085
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:22,500
 No, they would think about the bad things that had happened to you.

1086
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:26,500
 So if you and I are in a scene and I want to cry, I think about the bad things that have

1087
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,020
 happened to you and that will make me cry.

1088
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:29,020
 What?

1089
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:30,020
 That's very empathetic of you, isn't it?

1090
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:31,020
 It's very empathetic.

1091
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:34,700
 I would only laugh if I hear that bad things happening to other people.

1092
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:39,820
 That sounds like a you problem, you know?

1093
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:41,820
 And then you're crying with laughter.

1094
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:42,820
 Yes, yes, yes.

1095
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:46,020
 There's quite a common thing as you think about a bad thing that's happened to you,

1096
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:47,020
 right?

1097
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:48,020
 Probably the most common way of doing it.

1098
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:49,700
 That's the Stanislavski way of doing it.

1099
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:52,740
 Right, but for someone else, there's only the bad things that have happened to them.

1100
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:58,000
 Or there's a thing where you put, if I'm acting in a scene with you, Dan, I will put you in

1101
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,980
 a scene from my life, if you know what I mean.

1102
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:04,020
 Like, I'll imagine someone telling me that they're ill and then I'll think, okay, I'll

1103
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:06,180
 sort of recast you as that person in my life.

1104
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:09,820
 Imagine someone walking in with one candle on Dan's birthday cake.

1105
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:10,820
 Exactly, exactly.

1106
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:13,420
 There are some things that I just can't believe work.

1107
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:18,460
 The Toronto Film School website has a few tips and I tried the only one that was low

1108
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:24,900
 effort the yawning method, which was take a deep breath and slowly exhale while faking

1109
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:29,740
 a yawn, but keep your lips tightly pursed, which is where it becomes a bit more hard.

1110
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:33,340
 And then focus the yawn in the back of your throat like you're trying to swallow your

1111
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:34,340
 sadness.

1112
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:37,020
 But I found very difficult and hurt my throat quite a lot.

1113
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:39,620
 Okay, so I've just yawned and my eyes are watering a bit.

1114
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:41,260
 My eyes are watering as well.

1115
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:42,420
 Guys, you've actually done quite well.

1116
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,180
 But there's no tear coming out, but they are watering.

1117
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:45,180
 No, that's good.

1118
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:46,180
 I'm convinced.

1119
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:49,180
 But on camera, you want a bit of, you know, that subtle, yeah, that feels like, yeah.

1120
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:50,340
 No, I haven't wiped my eyes.

1121
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:51,340
 You're probably crying.

1122
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:52,340
 Yeah.

1123
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:53,340
 You okay?

1124
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:54,340
 Jesus.

1125
00:44:54,340 --> 00:45:00,180
 I was thinking about something bad that happened to me.

1126
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:01,740
 There's other methods.

1127
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,380
 There's a story of Natalie Wood.

1128
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:09,140
 She had to be able to cry on cue, but her mum solved the issue by ripping up a living

1129
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:12,860
 butterfly in front of her to ensure that she would cry.

1130
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:14,540
 So there's, there's an option.

1131
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:18,340
 They only live for a day, so it's like, you're not really cutting its life that short, are

1132
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:19,340
 you?

1133
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:21,980
 That's a Mayfly, you're thinking of.

1134
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:22,980
 Yeah.

1135
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:23,980
 Oh, shit.

1136
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:24,980
 Isn't that wild?

1137
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:25,980
 That's horrific.

1138
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:26,980
 Yeah.

1139
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:27,980
 There's another podcast called the rest is entertainment.

1140
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:28,980
 Have you guys heard of that?

1141
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:29,980
 No.

1142
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:30,980
 Okay.

1143
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:31,980
 So there's someone on that called Richard Osman.

1144
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:32,980
 Oh, the birthday game guy.

1145
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,620
 The birthday game guy, that's him.

1146
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:39,100
 And he said they spoke to an actor who said that they don't have to cry on demand.

1147
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:41,420
 They don't have to cry anymore because they do it in post on AI.

1148
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:43,820
 Oh, well, they, as in the CGI in.

1149
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:44,820
 Yeah.

1150
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:48,540
 So you could, you just kind of go like pull a face of someone who's crying, but you don't

1151
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:51,100
 have to do the actual tears because they'll, AI will do it.

1152
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:52,100
 That's really depressing.

1153
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:55,900
 I reckon a lot of the good actors still cry to silly the real cry, because you want the

1154
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:58,820
 realistic cry face, don't you?

1155
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:06,060
 Do you know that Ohio tried to ban fake crying, specifically in court in 2008?

1156
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,900
 Why might you try to ban crying in court?

1157
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:11,740
 Well, because it might influence the jury.

1158
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:12,740
 Exactly.

1159
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:17,140
 But it was, I think this is really interesting that they've assumed that fake crying exists.

1160
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:23,260
 And it was actually based on a case ruling by the Ohio Supreme Court in 1999 that said

1161
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:27,060
 it's improper to inflame a jury's emotions by crying.

1162
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:33,140
 And so there was a prosecutor called Jason Filibam, who was prosecuting people who were

1163
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:35,300
 up for the death penalty.

1164
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:40,460
 And he complained about the fact that defense attorneys would strategically cry on cue.

1165
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:44,020
 Oh, defense lawyers, not, okay, not people at the dock who might be lawyers.

1166
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:45,020
 No, sorry, defense lawyers.

1167
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:48,500
 So you'd be talking to the jury saying, this man does not deserve to die.

1168
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,020
 He's got a wife and kids and, you know, that is quite theatrical.

1169
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:53,580
 There's more theatrical than I think a British court would get.

1170
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:57,780
 Well, I think what the defense lawyers say is that they are quite attached to their case

1171
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:59,580
 and they believe strongly in what they're saying.

1172
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:02,380
 And they're very sad at the idea that a client might be killed for this.

1173
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:06,980
 I'd love it if they were busted by the court, who's the guy who does the drawings in the

1174
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:07,980
 court.

1175
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:11,500
 Yeah, you could just, there's this drawing that comes out of a lawyer with a tweezer

1176
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:12,500
 up his neck.

1177
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,500
 Right, a second.

1178
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:19,660
 Crying goes in and out of fashion, like in the medieval times, it could be a side of

1179
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:20,660
 manliness.

1180
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:26,620
 So if you read all the medieval romance stories of the Knights of Camelot, Galahad is always

1181
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:27,620
 bursting into tears.

1182
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:30,220
 You know, he's always crying and it's seen as a manly thing.

1183
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:31,380
 It's a virtue as well.

1184
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:34,380
 You know, they're very strong and powerful, but also they cry a lot and bishops would

1185
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:36,460
 always cry loads.

1186
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:40,060
 So there was an archbishop of Canterbury in the 13th century called Winchelsea and he

1187
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:43,580
 wept so much that the altar clots were sodden, supposedly.

1188
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:48,140
 Oh yeah, that's the reason.

1189
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:50,100
 We'll pop some sawdust on the altar next time.

1190
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:51,100
 It's fine.

1191
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:54,860
 But basically, eyesight was a kind of temptation because eyesight showed you all the sins of

1192
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:58,580
 the world and tears were bad for your eyesight.

1193
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:00,820
 You might even lose your eyesight if you cried so much.

1194
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:02,100
 So actually, it was, I mean...

1195
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:03,100
 You'll go blind.

1196
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:05,380
 You'll go blind if you keep doing that.

1197
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:08,820
 So a huge part of religious life was weeping because, you know, it might damage your eyesight.

1198
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:11,020
 Like Jesus wept in the Bible, of course.

1199
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:12,020
 Yeah.

1200
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:13,020
 And so...

1201
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:15,180
 Is that so you can go blind to the temptations of the world?

1202
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:16,180
 Kind of, yeah.

1203
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:19,660
 And that was seen as a, you know, that was a very holy thing to do.

1204
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:25,280
 And also you had to be celibate and non-violent, so tears kind of were, they stood in for combat.

1205
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:31,220
 You were in conflict against temptation, particularly sexual temptation, and tears were a part of

1206
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:34,820
 the response to the temptations of the world.

1207
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:37,540
 Like rather than have sex, but it's a kind of thing.

1208
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:38,540
 Yeah.

1209
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,820
 Or listen to a Spotify playlist.

1210
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:45,220
 Isn't it a bit of a giveaway if you're sort of standing with your wife and there's a woman

1211
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:50,580
 across and you're just filling up with tears because you're trying to not be tempted into

1212
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:51,580
 doing something?

1213
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:54,940
 If you're a medieval bishop, you won't be standing with your wife much, look at that.

1214
00:48:54,940 --> 00:49:00,840
 The little meme is a bishop and of none, and he's turning out looking at another of none,

1215
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:04,760
 and he's crying his eyes out.

1216
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:05,760
 Babies fake crying.

1217
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:06,760
 Okay.

1218
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:07,760
 Babies fake they're crying quite a lot.

1219
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:11,600
 So some babies are really crying, and you can tell they're really crying if you get to

1220
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:16,000
 a baby and comfort it and it stays, you know, a little upset for a little while, but sometimes

1221
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,440
 a baby will be crying, and if you go over and sue it, it immediately is...

1222
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:21,440
 It's all smiles.

1223
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:22,440
 Yeah.

1224
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:26,340
 And that's not really fake, and I mean, well, I suppose it is a manipulative way.

1225
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:31,180
 It is learned that that is a thing to do that prompts a response from a nearby grown-up.

1226
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:35,460
 But I guess in that case, they're crying because they want a grown-up there, so it's kind of

1227
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:36,460
 real.

1228
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:37,820
 Like they might feel lonely or...

1229
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:38,820
 Completely.

1230
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:39,820
 Yeah.

1231
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:40,820
 Worrying.

1232
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:41,820
 But it's not that proper emotional...

1233
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:43,980
 They're not in distress, but they are making, they're going through the motions of being

1234
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:44,980
 in distress.

1235
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:45,980
 They're pissed off, aren't they?

1236
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:46,980
 They're very strong difference.

1237
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:50,700
 It's very evident as soon as you do give them the thing back and they grin.

1238
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:56,760
 Other just reasons people cry that aren't to do with being sad.

1239
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:00,680
 Mice cry to prove how manly they are.

1240
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:05,920
 And this is because they release pheromones in their tears, and they're an aphrodisiac.

1241
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:09,360
 So quite opposite to humans, where I think there have been studies that show that if

1242
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:15,200
 human males smell women's tears, it stops them from being sexually aroused.

1243
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:18,200
 It's a study that found that.

1244
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:23,140
 Mice get sexually aroused by these pheromones, and they found that contact with tears mean

1245
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:28,060
 that a female mouse is three times more likely to engage in lordosis, which is that thing

1246
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:33,020
 where you thrust your rump in the air, asking for someone to have it.

1247
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:35,380
 I've never heard that phrase.

1248
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:36,380
 Lordosis.

1249
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:37,380
 I know it's a good one, isn't it?

1250
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:38,380
 Oh, wow.

1251
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:41,420
 Also, have you ever thought of doing chili-cooper audio butts?

1252
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:42,420
 Oh, yeah.

1253
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:43,420
 Have that rump.

1254
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:44,420
 Yes.

1255
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:54,160

1256
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:55,160
