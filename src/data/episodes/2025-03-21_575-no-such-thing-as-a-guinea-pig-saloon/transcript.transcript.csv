00:00:00,00:00:05,"Hi everybody, Anna and Andy here. Just before this week's show, we have a little announcement"
00:00:05,00:00:11,"to make, which is that our colleagues, Jack and Manu, have started their own podcast,"
00:00:11,00:00:13,which is about food and it's called Lunchbox Envy.
00:00:13,00:00:24,"Yes, they have and it is, it's spicy, it's salty, it's saucy, it's sweet, it's vinegary."
00:00:24,00:00:29,"It's great, it's a food-based podcast jam-packed with really amazing, interesting facts about"
00:00:29,00:00:34,"food that, I mean, I didn't know, we've been researching for ten years. Why our own babies"
00:00:34,00:00:37,don't just drink our blood? Do you want to know the answer to that?
00:00:37,00:00:41,"I do, I'm happy that they don't, but yeah, every episode is about a different kind of"
00:00:41,00:00:44,"food, so they've done all sorts so far, they've done garlic and sausage and chicken. They"
00:00:44,00:00:49,"co-host it with Rosy McKean, the pasta queen, all three of them, every week they bring something"
00:00:49,00:00:53,new to the table in their lunchboxes about that particular food they talk about. It's
00:00:53,00:00:58,"great fun, it's the most umami podcast I've heard for ages."
00:00:58,00:01:03,"Every staff and everyone who listens to it loves it, it's got five stars by 97% of listeners."
00:01:03,00:01:08,It's been featured by Amazon and Apple Podcasts already. You've got to get listening for
00:01:08,00:01:12,"your food fix, so wherever you get your podcasts, look for Lunchbox Envy."
00:01:12,00:01:18,"All right, pack your lunch up, squash that sandwich down, give that a listen and on with"
00:01:18,00:01:19,the show.
00:01:19,00:01:20,On with the show.
00:01:20,00:01:42,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:01:42,00:01:47,"to you from the QI offices in Hoburn. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Andrew"
00:01:47,00:01:52,"Hunter Murray, Anna Tyshinski and James Harkin, and once again we have gathered around the"
00:01:52,00:01:57,"microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular"
00:01:57,00:02:03,"order, here we go. Starting with fact number one, that is Andy."
00:02:03,00:02:07,"My fact is, there's a city in Alaska where almost the entire population lives in one"
00:02:07,00:02:08,building.
00:02:08,00:02:09,Big building?
00:02:09,00:02:13,"Yeah, they call it the One House Town."
00:02:13,00:02:14,Very good.
00:02:14,00:02:15,Very clever.
00:02:15,00:02:19,"I thought it was everyone, it turns out there's another tiny block of flats nearby where there's"
00:02:19,00:02:24,"a little bit of overspill, which is so annoying, and if the city of Whittier, Alaska could shut"
00:02:24,00:02:25,that down.
00:02:25,00:02:26,Yeah.
00:02:26,00:02:27,One building would be a much better fact.
00:02:27,00:02:31,"Do we know who, is it the sort of the social rejects who live in the smaller building?"
00:02:31,00:02:32,Almost certainly.
00:02:32,00:02:33,The people who have pissed somebody off.
00:02:33,00:02:37,"Actually, I found a few people who live in that second building. One of them is the mayor."
00:02:37,00:02:38,Oh really?
00:02:38,00:02:39,No.
00:02:39,00:02:43,"And another one is an artist called Brenda Tolman, who used to live in this big building,"
00:02:43,00:02:46,"which I think is called BTI, which we'll get to in a minute, but she moved to the other"
00:02:46,00:02:52,"complex because of what she called the forced socialization of this building, which is basically"
00:02:52,00:02:57,"people will just come over in their socks and pants and just go, ""Oh, how's it going?"""
00:02:57,00:03:01,"It is pretty amazing, because there's about 300 people that live in this building."
00:03:01,00:03:07,"So that's your teachers, that's law enforcement, that's the grocers, and they do literally,"
00:03:07,00:03:11,"if they want to hang out, just stay in the elevator, you're bound to bump into everyone,"
00:03:11,00:03:12,because that's your social life.
00:03:12,00:03:14,And that's why I'm afraid of lifts.
00:03:14,00:03:18,"No, but rush hour in the morning is when there's a queue for every lift in the building,"
00:03:18,00:03:22,"because everyone's getting to work, and the anyway is up and down."
00:03:22,00:03:23,That's right.
00:03:23,00:03:24,"And work is in the building, right?"
00:03:24,00:03:28,Like the doctors and the shops and the school and everything you need.
00:03:28,00:03:33,"The school isn't in the building, the school is on the other side of the road."
00:03:33,00:03:36,I don't know if you've been on Google Maps and had a look at the whole area.
00:03:36,00:03:38,"Yes, because don't you get to it by a tunnel, actually?"
00:03:38,00:03:42,"So you have to go down in that building to the bottom floor, to the basement, and then"
00:03:42,00:03:43,you go in the little tunnel you get to the school.
00:03:43,00:03:44,I half count that.
00:03:44,00:03:45,Yeah.
00:03:45,00:03:46,You don't have to go outside.
00:03:46,00:03:47,Yeah.
00:03:47,00:03:52,"And it does sound like the school times were changed because of what Andy just said, the"
00:03:52,00:03:56,"congestion in the elevator, you couldn't get all the kids to school in time."
00:03:56,00:03:59,"So they had to, yeah, everything has moved around the elevator service, basically."
00:03:59,00:04:01,I've got a slight quibble.
00:04:01,00:04:04,We say that they're all living in one building.
00:04:04,00:04:05,I would argue it's three buildings.
00:04:05,00:04:06,Uh-oh.
00:04:06,00:04:07,Okay.
00:04:07,00:04:10,"Because it's a sort of three-tower thing, but they're joined together."
00:04:10,00:04:11,"Yeah, exactly."
00:04:11,00:04:16,So it's actually a 20-centimeter space between three separate buildings for earthquake purposes.
00:04:16,00:04:20,"So they needed for it to have sway because it survived one of the greatest, most powerful"
00:04:20,00:04:23,"earthquakes, a 9.2er."
00:04:23,00:04:24,It survived.
00:04:24,00:04:25,But are they joined together?
00:04:25,00:04:26,"Well, there's a few platings."
00:04:26,00:04:27,"Yes, they are."
00:04:27,00:04:29,There's a few platings here joined together.
00:04:29,00:04:30,And we'll retract it.
00:04:30,00:04:31,Thank you.
00:04:31,00:04:32,We'll deny it.
00:04:32,00:04:35,And the history of it is very cool.
00:04:35,00:04:38,"This place was developed in the second world war as a military harbour, basically, and"
00:04:38,00:04:43,"a logistics base, because it's in Alaska, so it's quite near Russia, quite near Japan."
00:04:43,00:04:46,"And Japan actually occupied a little bit of Alaska in the second world war, but quite"
00:04:46,00:04:47,near is a bit of a stretch.
00:04:47,00:04:48,But you know what I mean?
00:04:48,00:04:49,Relatively.
00:04:49,00:04:53,It's a good bit for Japan to try and evade if they're going to go for it.
00:04:53,00:04:55,So two buildings were built in the town.
00:04:55,00:04:59,"This one, this is opened in 1957, the BTI Tower."
00:04:59,00:05:02,"And they planned loads more, but they only built two in the end."
00:05:02,00:05:07,"And the other one is abandoned now, and it's just sitting there next to the one-house town."
00:05:07,00:05:12,"And it's so creepy, like it was a military base, and it was quite secret, and they had"
00:05:12,00:05:13,all sorts of stuff in it.
00:05:13,00:05:14,The Buckner Building.
00:05:14,00:05:15,"The Buckner Building, exactly."
00:05:15,00:05:19,And it had a theatre and a bowling alley and a library and a barbershop and a church and
00:05:19,00:05:20,a rifle range.
00:05:20,00:05:21,It was lovely.
00:05:21,00:05:25,"And then it was very quickly abandoned because it was damaged by this earthquake in 1964,"
00:05:25,00:05:27,the big Alaska earthquake.
00:05:27,00:05:30,Sometimes people break in and ski through the corridors of that building.
00:05:30,00:05:31,That's cool.
00:05:31,00:05:36,"Apparently one of the hazards, hibernating bears is the issue in that one."
00:05:36,00:05:37,Wow.
00:05:37,00:05:40,"It is very snowy there, isn't it?"
00:05:40,00:05:45,"Which I maybe you'd expect from Alaska generally, but I think it gets a thousand times more"
00:05:45,00:05:48,"snow than the US average, which obviously a lot of the US doesn't get very much snow"
00:05:48,00:05:49,at all.
00:05:49,00:05:50,There's a lot though.
00:05:50,00:05:51,There's a lot.
00:05:51,00:05:52,Yes.
00:05:52,00:05:56,"But also nicely, it's named Whittier, as you said, and it's sort of named after this"
00:05:56,00:05:59,poet called John Greenleaf Whittier.
00:05:59,00:06:03,"And well, a glacier nearby was named after him, and then it was named after the glacier."
00:06:03,00:06:06,And his most famous work was about snow.
00:06:06,00:06:08,I think it was called snowed in by coincidence.
00:06:08,00:06:09,Oh.
00:06:09,00:06:10,So there you go.
00:06:10,00:06:11,That's pretty cool.
00:06:11,00:06:12,That is very cool.
00:06:12,00:06:17,"I found a Reddit which had asked me anything by someone who lived in this building, a guy"
00:06:17,00:06:18,called Spankadelic.
00:06:18,00:06:19,"Oh, yeah."
00:06:19,00:06:24,Imagine you're locked in a building and that's one of your neighbours.
00:06:24,00:06:28,"I would more be worried about having the next door flat for him, trying to get it asleep"
00:06:28,00:06:29,at night.
00:06:29,00:06:35,"Keep it down a bit, please, Spankadelic."
00:06:35,00:06:41,"So Spankadelic said, ""I lived in Whittier, A.K., in a building which has the entire town"
00:06:41,00:06:45,"of 200 people, ask me anything,"" a rainy sunbun said."
00:06:45,00:06:47,So what about the sex lives?
00:06:47,00:06:48,Is it mostly families who live there?
00:06:48,00:06:54,"I'd imagine everyone is just having sex with everyone, to which Spankadelic replied, ""It"
00:06:54,00:06:59,"was mostly families and really old people, so no, it was not like that at all."""
00:06:59,00:07:00,And then Hard Spank 916.
00:07:00,00:07:01,What?
00:07:01,00:07:03,This is a normal Reddit thread.
00:07:03,00:07:05,It's not some kind of weird layer of Reddit.
00:07:05,00:07:06,Is this a relation?
00:07:06,00:07:15,"Hard Spank said, ""Isn't Alaska A.L. an Arkansas A.K.?"" to which Spankadelic replied, ""Nope."
00:07:15,00:07:16,"Understandable mistake, though."
00:07:16,00:07:17,"Nice username."""
00:07:17,00:07:22,That was the entire interesting bit.
00:07:22,00:07:23,Wow.
00:07:23,00:07:24,We had it.
00:07:24,00:07:28,One of the most fascinating things about people living in this building is if they want to
00:07:28,00:07:35,"go to the major local town, Anchorage, you can only get to it via this tunnel, the Anton"
00:07:35,00:07:37,Anderson Memorial Tunnel.
00:07:37,00:07:39,It's four kilometers long.
00:07:39,00:07:40,You're not allowed to walk through it.
00:07:40,00:07:41,You're not allowed to bike through it.
00:07:41,00:07:46,"It's for trains and cars only, and it shuts every night at about 10.30."
00:07:46,00:07:51,"So if you go to the movies, you've got to be back before 10.30, otherwise they just shut"
00:07:51,00:07:52,it down.
00:07:52,00:07:53,That's fantastic.
00:07:53,00:07:55,And you've got to sleep in your car and wait for it to open in the morning.
00:07:55,00:07:56,"As people do, right?"
00:07:56,00:08:00,"There are sort of huge people who've lost it, and the tunnel doesn't seem to have been"
00:08:00,00:08:02,built to accommodate what it's meant for.
00:08:02,00:08:03,"No, it wasn't."
00:08:03,00:08:04,So it was built for a train.
00:08:04,00:08:08,"It was initially, you could only get there by boat and by, when this tunnel opened by"
00:08:08,00:08:13,"train, and then they adapted the tunnel in 2000 to be a road tunnel as well, but they"
00:08:13,00:08:15,didn't add an extra lane or anything.
00:08:15,00:08:19,"They just put a bit of tarmac down in between the train tracks, and so now you can either"
00:08:19,00:08:23,"drive or get the train, and there are very strict timings, obviously, of when you're"
00:08:23,00:08:24,allowed to drive.
00:08:24,00:08:26,"And it's also one lane, isn't it?"
00:08:26,00:08:30,"So the train's coming all the time, so every hour the direction switches."
00:08:30,00:08:35,"So you arrive there, you've got a 15-minute window, you can go through that, and then"
00:08:35,00:08:39,they have to air it out after every single line of traffic that's gone through.
00:08:39,00:08:40,They've got massive fans all the way through.
00:08:40,00:08:41,I give that five minutes ago.
00:08:41,00:08:45,I've always wondered why they have big fans in tunnels.
00:08:45,00:08:46,Can anyone tell me that?
00:08:46,00:08:47,I can.
00:08:47,00:08:48,It's to suck out the fumes.
00:08:48,00:08:52,"If you get stuck in the tunnel and the tunnel's shut down and people's car engines are on,"
00:08:52,00:08:54,the air can get very toxic very quickly.
00:08:54,00:08:58,"And so this tunnel has a few little safe house bits, and it's got huge fans to blow out the"
00:08:58,00:08:59,fumes.
00:08:59,00:09:03,"I was going back to when they were building the access tunnel, and most of them seemed"
00:09:03,00:09:04,to be hugely against it.
00:09:04,00:09:09,"There was a lot of protest, because they pride themselves on being this place you could not"
00:09:09,00:09:13,"access by road, you know, we're on our own here, we don't want you."
00:09:13,00:09:16,"It was famous as like the real middle of nowhere city, wasn't it?"
00:09:16,00:09:20,And I think quite a lot of people moved there because they wanted to get away from it all.
00:09:20,00:09:21,Yeah.
00:09:21,00:09:24,"I think you kind of hear stories of people who lived there, who said, ""Yeah, I was having"
00:09:24,00:09:29,"a bad time in LA, and I decided to come here instead,"" kind of thing."
00:09:29,00:09:33,"That earthquake in 1964, which trashed the other building, and which the main building"
00:09:33,00:09:38,"survived, that sounds extraordinary, as in it was a lot of Alaska it hit."
00:09:38,00:09:40,About 140 people were killed by it.
00:09:40,00:09:44,I think it was the second largest earthquake in recorded history.
00:09:44,00:09:46,And it was on Good Friday in 1964.
00:09:46,00:09:49,Some places got 30 feet higher because of the tectonic plates.
00:09:49,00:09:51,Because the ground shifted up.
00:09:51,00:09:52,Yeah.
00:09:52,00:09:53,Cool.
00:09:53,00:09:54,And it was impressive.
00:09:54,00:09:58,"Some salmon could no longer jump up to their spawning grounds, because the cliff they had"
00:09:58,00:09:59,to jump up had just gone...
00:09:59,00:10:01,30 feet is a long way for a salmon.
00:10:01,00:10:06,"No one ever thinks about the salmon in earthquakes, do they?"
00:10:06,00:10:07,No.
00:10:07,00:10:08,And there might be another one one day.
00:10:08,00:10:12,"There's a receding glacier, which is 50 kilometers away, and that's destabilized a mountain"
00:10:12,00:10:13,side.
00:10:13,00:10:17,"And they think that mountain, if there's any earthquake, that mountain's going to slip"
00:10:17,00:10:19,and cause a tsunami.
00:10:19,00:10:23,"And even though it is two hours away by boat, this mountain side, it'll hit Whittier in"
00:10:23,00:10:25,about 20 minutes.
00:10:25,00:10:26,The tsunami.
00:10:26,00:10:27,Wow.
00:10:27,00:10:28,Thanks.
00:10:28,00:10:29,Yeah.
00:10:29,00:10:30,So everyone in the tunnel.
00:10:30,00:10:31,Yeah.
00:10:31,00:10:33,"And also the building's reaching its end of use date, really."
00:10:33,00:10:34,Is it?
00:10:34,00:10:38,"It's what they keep saying structurally, this might be, you know, not for a very long."
00:10:38,00:10:39,Interesting.
00:10:39,00:10:42,You know how it's on Prince William Sound?
00:10:42,00:10:43,Yeah.
00:10:43,00:10:44,"Well, I was..."
00:10:44,00:10:45,So Prince William Sound...
00:10:45,00:10:46,What is a sound?
00:10:46,00:10:47,What is a sound?
00:10:47,00:10:48,"Well, the F is a sound."
00:10:48,00:10:49,I just thought...
00:10:49,00:10:53,Prince William Sound is the one thing you'll never hear Prince Harry say.
00:10:53,00:10:54,That's probably...
00:10:54,00:10:55,Yeah.
00:10:55,00:10:56,So Prince William Sound is a very important piece of water.
00:10:56,00:10:57,And we should say the reason it was...
00:10:57,00:11:01,The military base was put there is because it was the only non-freezing harbour.
00:11:01,00:11:03,So it was really militarily important.
00:11:03,00:11:04,So it doesn't freeze in the winter.
00:11:04,00:11:05,It doesn't freeze over.
00:11:05,00:11:06,Yeah.
00:11:06,00:11:09,"So it was the only place you could get boats to repel, maybe a Japanese attack and get"
00:11:09,00:11:10,supplies over.
00:11:10,00:11:11,But yeah.
00:11:11,00:11:12,"I was like, what is a sound?"
00:11:12,00:11:15,I'm going to do everyone the favor of telling you so you don't have to wonder next time.
00:11:15,00:11:16,So I bloody mentioned it.
00:11:16,00:11:18,It's actually not very well defined.
00:11:18,00:11:21,It's a number of options.
00:11:21,00:11:25,"So a narrow passage of water between a mainland and an inland or like a recessed bit of ocean,"
00:11:25,00:11:28,which I guess is what we all imagine.
00:11:28,00:11:29,But it comes...
00:11:29,00:11:30,You show big hills on each side.
00:11:30,00:11:31,I always imagine.
00:11:31,00:11:32,I don't know why.
00:11:32,00:11:33,"Yes, me too."
00:11:33,00:11:35,I actually wonder if I imagine that because I imagine them being an echo because it's
00:11:35,00:11:36,got the word sound.
00:11:36,00:11:39,What's the most famous sound?
00:11:39,00:11:40,Is it Long Island?
00:11:40,00:11:41,Is there a Long Island sound?
00:11:41,00:11:42,I feel like there is.
00:11:42,00:11:43,I don't know.
00:11:43,00:11:44,"For me, it's..."
00:11:44,00:11:45,Is it Pudget Sound?
00:11:45,00:11:46,"Pudget Sound, yes."
00:11:46,00:11:53,"There are lots in Alaska, but it comes from an old Norse word, sund, which means to swim."
00:11:53,00:11:57,And so it's because it was like a portion of water that you could swim across.
00:11:57,00:12:00,So from one bit of land to another.
00:12:00,00:12:02,And that also used to be the name for a fish's swim bladder.
00:12:02,00:12:03,Do you think I could find that?
00:12:03,00:12:04,You'd call it sound.
00:12:04,00:12:06,That's such solid research.
00:12:06,00:12:08,It's so sad I went too deep.
00:12:08,00:12:09,That's really good.
00:12:09,00:12:10,Do you know why Juno...
00:12:10,00:12:12,"You know Juno, the capital of Alaska in fact."
00:12:12,00:12:13,Yes.
00:12:13,00:12:14,Do you know why that's called Juno?
00:12:14,00:12:15,Juno.
00:12:15,00:12:16,Yeah.
00:12:16,00:12:17,Exactly.
00:12:17,00:12:18,I've been to Juno.
00:12:18,00:12:19,You?
00:12:19,00:12:20,Yeah.
00:12:20,00:12:21,That's quite cool.
00:12:21,00:12:22,That's...
00:12:22,00:12:24,"No, it's a really nice place to be."
00:12:24,00:12:25,But I thought it was named after a person.
00:12:25,00:12:26,It is.
00:12:26,00:12:29,"It's named after Joe Juno, but there's more to it."
00:12:29,00:12:31,So Juno is the capital and you can't get to it by road.
00:12:31,00:12:34,You can only get by boat or plane.
00:12:34,00:12:38,"And named after Joe Juno, because it was founded by him and Richard Harris, I don't think the"
00:12:38,00:12:45,"actor played Dumbledore because it was in the 1880s, because they found gold there."
00:12:45,00:12:48,"And then a whole bunch of other people like flocked there to find gold, a guy called Rockwell"
00:12:48,00:12:54,"took over and it was originally called Harrisburg after Richard Harris, because Juno was French"
00:12:54,00:12:57,"Canadian so couldn't write English, so Harris was just like, ""Well, I'll just write down"
00:12:57,00:12:58,"my name then."""
00:12:58,00:13:03,But then there was a winter in 1881 where all the leading figures in the area left for
00:13:03,00:13:08,"winter to do other stuff, except Joe Juno, who was a man's man and kind of a really fun"
00:13:08,00:13:09,guy.
00:13:09,00:13:14,He stayed with all the miners and he spent the entire winter in the saloons buying them
00:13:14,00:13:16,all drinks throughout the winter.
00:13:16,00:13:19,"So at the end of that winter, the miners all took a vote amongst themselves to change the"
00:13:19,00:13:20,name to Juno.
00:13:20,00:13:21,"Wow, that is cool."
00:13:21,00:13:30,"I don't think I've said this before, they have sawdust on the floor, do you know why"
00:13:30,00:13:32,they have sawdust on the floor?
00:13:32,00:13:38,"To soak up spit and urine, is that not genuinely why?"
00:13:38,00:13:39,Unbomb it.
00:13:39,00:13:40,"Yeah, that's what people are doing."
00:13:40,00:13:44,"They don't have any toilets and when you ask them, they say, ""Oh, just go there."""
00:13:44,00:13:51,It's a litter tray-based system.
00:13:51,00:13:54,"Especially all guinea pigs that live there, we so mentioned."
00:13:54,00:14:01,"So if people drop their food, they don't act like animals and re-eat it."
00:14:01,00:14:05,"So it's about dropping things, think about what Anna said about why people went to Juno"
00:14:05,00:14:06,in the first place.
00:14:06,00:14:12,"Mine is, mine for gold, and if you drop your gold, you will lose it in the sawdust."
00:14:12,00:14:13,Yes.
00:14:13,00:14:14,"And then, what does the owner do?"
00:14:14,00:14:16,Then the barman gets to sweep it up at the end of the day.
00:14:16,00:14:20,"Sweeps it all up, puts it in a big barrel, the sawdust floats on top of the barrel, but"
00:14:20,00:14:21,the gold goes to the bottom.
00:14:21,00:14:22,Brilliant.
00:14:22,00:14:23,Take it out.
00:14:23,00:14:24,Brilliant.
00:14:24,00:14:25,Is that true?
00:14:25,00:14:26,"That's true, yeah."
00:14:26,00:14:27,That's great.
00:14:27,00:14:28,That's very cool.
00:14:28,00:14:29,"Do you know, actually, I said there are two ways."
00:14:29,00:14:30,There are three ways to get into Juno.
00:14:30,00:14:31,"Oh, a boat."
00:14:31,00:14:32,I don't think they are.
00:14:32,00:14:33,So we've got boat and plane.
00:14:33,00:14:34,"Yeah, boat and plane."
00:14:34,00:14:38,I know there's no roads that go in because I was told that if you want to borrow someone's
00:14:38,00:14:41,"car, you can just ask them and they'll just let you borrow it because they don't."
00:14:41,00:14:42,You can't drive that.
00:14:42,00:14:43,That's okay.
00:14:43,00:14:44,I was told that.
00:14:44,00:14:45,I never tried it.
00:14:45,00:14:46,But yeah.
00:14:46,00:14:47,"You're so totally, can't you?"
00:14:47,00:14:48,So it's not his boat.
00:14:48,00:14:49,It's air.
00:14:49,00:14:50,There's no road.
00:14:50,00:14:51,So it's a tunnel.
00:14:51,00:14:52,I'll give you a clue.
00:14:52,00:14:53,It's sort of tunnel.
00:14:53,00:14:54,It's a canal.
00:14:54,00:14:56,"But what I actually, this is just a trick question."
00:14:56,00:14:58,What kind of canal?
00:14:58,00:14:59,Narrowboat canal.
00:14:59,00:15:00,A berth canal.
00:15:00,00:15:01,You know what?
00:15:01,00:15:03,"I should be annoyed about that question, but I really like it."
00:15:03,00:15:04,You could be gone there.
00:15:04,00:15:15,Okay.
00:15:15,00:15:18,"It is time for fact number two, and that is James."
00:15:18,00:15:19,Okay.
00:15:19,00:15:24,My fact this week is that the earliest known kids birthday party included the sacrifice
00:15:24,00:15:26,of a sheep.
00:15:26,00:15:27,When was this?
00:15:27,00:15:33,"This was during the reign of King Lugalanda in a city called Lagash, which was in ancient"
00:15:33,00:15:34,Sumer.
00:15:34,00:15:38,"And the reason we know about it is because there are cuneiform tablets, which describe"
00:15:38,00:15:39,it.
00:15:39,00:15:44,"And there's a historian called Vladimir Emilianov, at St. Petersburg University, who studied"
00:15:44,00:15:45,these tablets.
00:15:45,00:15:50,And he found that there is a mention of celebrating the births of the rulers children.
00:15:50,00:15:56,"And when they celebrated the birthdays, they sacrificed an animal and shared it with their"
00:15:56,00:15:57,deceased ancestors.
00:15:57,00:15:58,So.
00:15:58,00:16:01,Interested party bags that were left on the tune.
00:16:01,00:16:02,You got a blower.
00:16:02,00:16:03,A hat.
00:16:03,00:16:04,A liver.
00:16:04,00:16:05,So yeah.
00:16:05,00:16:06,Lucky kids.
00:16:06,00:16:10,Lucky little Sumerian kids.
00:16:10,00:16:14,"When he was taken away from power, Lugalanda, because he was quite corrupt, we kind of"
00:16:14,00:16:19,"lose the birthday party for a while, and we don't have anything more on them until, you"
00:16:19,00:16:20,know.
00:16:20,00:16:21,Really recently.
00:16:21,00:16:22,Not really in ancient Egypt.
00:16:22,00:16:23,They didn't really do it.
00:16:23,00:16:24,And.
00:16:24,00:16:30,"I read that there were birthday parties in ancient Rome, but they were only for the"
00:16:30,00:16:31,male head of the family.
00:16:31,00:16:34,So only the dad basically got a birthday party.
00:16:34,00:16:36,It was incredibly unfair for the children.
00:16:36,00:16:37,So funny.
00:16:37,00:16:42,"Herodotus wrote about the Persians celebrating their birthdays, but the fact that he was"
00:16:42,00:16:45,"writing about the Persians and going, ""Isn't this weird that they do it?"" suggests that"
00:16:45,00:16:48,probably in the Greek and Roman world it was quite unusual.
00:16:48,00:16:49,Yeah.
00:16:49,00:16:50,Yeah.
00:16:50,00:16:51,You might celebrate the gods.
00:16:51,00:16:52,"Yeah, you celebrate the gods."
00:16:52,00:16:53,There's a day with the gods.
00:16:53,00:16:55,Like you give Artemis a cake on her birthday.
00:16:55,00:16:56,But that's not.
00:16:56,00:16:57,What a waste of cake.
00:16:57,00:17:01,Imagine the only time you make a cake is for a fictional being who doesn't eat it.
00:17:01,00:17:03,"We're just like, ""How long did they sit there?"""
00:17:03,00:17:06,"Because right now you can just go to a supermarket and buy a birthday cake, even while it's"
00:17:06,00:17:07,not your birthday.
00:17:07,00:17:08,It's unbelievable.
00:17:08,00:17:09,I think we've gone too far the other way.
00:17:09,00:17:10,We have gone too far.
00:17:10,00:17:11,There it is.
00:17:11,00:17:13,"When you put it like that, it sounds insane."
00:17:13,00:17:15,"There's nothing stopping you, Andy."
00:17:15,00:17:17,"You can do it right now, after the show."
00:17:17,00:17:20,Just my programming just wouldn't let me buy a Colin the Calf Biller.
00:17:20,00:17:26,"Honestly, nothing's stopping you doing that and putting candles on it."
00:17:26,00:17:33,"The earliest surviving handwritten Latin message by a woman, quite a lot of caveats"
00:17:33,00:17:36,"to that, was an invitation to a birthday party."
00:17:36,00:17:39,It was by someone called Claudius Severa.
00:17:39,00:17:44,"It was found at Hadrian's Wall, in fact, in the first century, almost 2000 years ago."
00:17:44,00:17:49,"She was the wife of an officer and she was inviting her friend, Leppardina, to her party."
00:17:49,00:17:53,"She said, ""On the 11th of September, please come."
00:17:53,00:17:55,I give you a warm invitation to make sure you come to us.
00:17:55,00:17:58,"To make the day more enjoyable for me by your arrival."""
00:17:58,00:18:04,It's pretty amazing because that is the oldest now date that we have for a birthday party
00:18:04,00:18:06,"and it happened about 100 AD, right?"
00:18:06,00:18:10,"But on top of it, it's September the 11th as the birthday party."
00:18:10,00:18:13,"We can't necessarily assume that was her actual birthday, but that's when the party"
00:18:13,00:18:14,was.
00:18:14,00:18:15,It might have been the weekend.
00:18:15,00:18:16,"It might have been the weekend, exactly."
00:18:16,00:18:17,You have it.
00:18:17,00:18:18,I don't want to assume.
00:18:18,00:18:20,Everyone at the party will have asked it in Latin.
00:18:20,00:18:21,Is it today?
00:18:21,00:18:24,"No, it was Thursday."
00:18:24,00:18:29,But that date is almost bang on for when the most popular birthdays tend to be.
00:18:29,00:18:33,"September the 16th comes out most likely, but if you look at the top 10 most likely"
00:18:33,00:18:35,"dates of birthdays, they're all September."
00:18:35,00:18:39,Because people have sex when it's cold and dark and off his parties and stuff.
00:18:39,00:18:41,And then nine months later.
00:18:41,00:18:44,"But so that's the birthday of the birthday, isn't it, really?"
00:18:44,00:18:45,Exactly.
00:18:45,00:18:49,"But unfortunately, it's September 11th, so I thought we could really do a massive party."
00:18:49,00:18:52,"No, for the world."
00:18:52,00:18:57,"In Europe, I think you wouldn't have birthdays until the 19th century was sort of like proper"
00:18:57,00:18:58,birthday parties.
00:18:58,00:18:59,Not really.
00:18:59,00:19:01,And there are loads of theories as to why.
00:19:01,00:19:04,"So in the 19th century, you everyone had 18 children and it's exhausting celebrating"
00:19:04,00:19:05,them all.
00:19:05,00:19:08,"When that started to come down a bit, you've got two or three children, you think, okay,"
00:19:08,00:19:11,"fine, we can do birthdays now."
00:19:11,00:19:12,Where's one theory?
00:19:12,00:19:13,Yeah.
00:19:13,00:19:15,And also there's a big change because it used to be name days.
00:19:15,00:19:16,So I love this.
00:19:16,00:19:20,"A day used to be every name, every common name would have a day."
00:19:20,00:19:21,And it's normally a saint's day.
00:19:21,00:19:23,So Saint James's day or Saint Anna's day.
00:19:23,00:19:24,Still that in some countries.
00:19:24,00:19:25,Yeah.
00:19:25,00:19:26,"In Greece, for sure."
00:19:26,00:19:30,Like my brother-in-law is Greek and he celebrates his name day.
00:19:30,00:19:31,There you go.
00:19:31,00:19:35,"And so I think the theory is, everyone knows, oh, it's Saint Christopher's day."
00:19:35,00:19:38,"So if your name is Christopher, you get a lot more attention from strangers."
00:19:38,00:19:41,"They say, oh, people who know your name but don't know much about you, they say, oh,"
00:19:41,00:19:42,"happy, happy, some Christopher's day is your name day."
00:19:42,00:19:44,So you get more kind of general attention.
00:19:44,00:19:47,"Actually, I just remember we did that at primary school."
00:19:47,00:19:48,Really?
00:19:48,00:19:49,Yeah.
00:19:49,00:19:50,Yeah.
00:19:50,00:19:51,We went to a Catholic school.
00:19:51,00:19:52,There we go.
00:19:52,00:19:53,"We'd all have a name day, wouldn't we?"
00:19:53,00:19:54,With our four names.
00:19:54,00:19:55,Yeah.
00:19:55,00:19:56,We would.
00:19:56,00:19:57,Yes.
00:19:57,00:19:58,"And there are rare names, obviously."
00:19:58,00:19:59,If your name is really unusual.
00:19:59,00:20:00,I can't think of any unusual names now.
00:20:00,00:20:01,You couldn't think of one.
00:20:01,00:20:02,Could you?
00:20:02,00:20:03,You couldn't think of one.
00:20:03,00:20:04,Cersei.
00:20:04,00:20:05,Cersei.
00:20:05,00:20:06,Brilliant.
00:20:06,00:20:08,"If your name is Cersei, there is a tradition in some places like Latvia where the 22nd of"
00:20:08,00:20:11,May is the name day for people who don't have a name day.
00:20:11,00:20:12,"Oh, that's good."
00:20:12,00:20:13,In a normal calendar.
00:20:13,00:20:14,That's nice.
00:20:14,00:20:17,"So, they celebrated birthdays when they were being brought in."
00:20:17,00:20:18,"Pagan, isn't it?"
00:20:18,00:20:19,It's Pagan.
00:20:19,00:20:20,Name days are saintly.
00:20:20,00:20:21,That's proper.
00:20:21,00:20:22,Yeah.
00:20:22,00:20:23,And birthdays were a bit...
00:20:23,00:20:27,Another reason they came in in kind of industrial revolution time is because dates and times
00:20:27,00:20:30,"became important, whereas they didn't used to be."
00:20:30,00:20:33,So people started having clocks and we started knowing what date it was.
00:20:33,00:20:37,"And people had calendars that, you know, the printing had become much bigger so people"
00:20:37,00:20:39,could have calendars in their houses.
00:20:39,00:20:43,"And until then, you would be, you know, what's it like outside now at time of recording?"
00:20:43,00:20:44,It was the start of spring.
00:20:44,00:20:45,And you just know it was the start of spring.
00:20:45,00:20:48,You wouldn't necessarily know that it was the 5th of March or April.
00:20:48,00:20:49,Yeah.
00:20:49,00:20:50,"No one knew what their birthday was, probably."
00:20:50,00:20:51,No.
00:20:51,00:20:52,Have you guys heard?
00:20:52,00:20:53,There's a tradition in Germany.
00:20:53,00:20:54,And birthdays are quite big in Germany.
00:20:54,00:20:57,A lot of offices will have a birthday calendar in the kitchen.
00:20:57,00:21:01,"Oh, and you can't, under any circumstances, wish someone a happy birthday in advance."
00:21:01,00:21:02,Very bad luck.
00:21:02,00:21:03,That is bad luck in a few cultures.
00:21:03,00:21:04,I completely agree.
00:21:04,00:21:06,I say happy new year when it comes.
00:21:06,00:21:08,People start throwing around happy new year on the 28th of December.
00:21:08,00:21:09,I shut that down.
00:21:09,00:21:10,Do you?
00:21:10,00:21:11,"Well, yeah."
00:21:11,00:21:12,How do we know the new year is going to come?
00:21:12,00:21:13,We're just going to get around.
00:21:13,00:21:14,"Well, that's the thing."
00:21:14,00:21:18,"In Russia, if you wish someone's happy birthday before the birthday, then the idea is that"
00:21:18,00:21:19,they'll die before the birthday.
00:21:19,00:21:20,Yeah.
00:21:20,00:21:22,It's just a fool's errand doing that.
00:21:22,00:21:25,You think the earth will explode when someone says that to you.
00:21:25,00:21:26,I'm not saying it will.
00:21:26,00:21:27,I'm saying let's not take the risk.
00:21:27,00:21:28,But there is a tradition.
00:21:28,00:21:31,"Please write it if you're German listening to this, and this is real."
00:21:31,00:21:34,"In the north and west of Germany, if you have a birthday after the age of 30, but you're"
00:21:34,00:21:40,"an unmarried man, there's a tradition that you have to sweep the steps of your town hall"
00:21:40,00:21:43,dressed as a woman until you are kissed by a virgin.
00:21:43,00:21:46,I don't think that happens.
00:21:46,00:21:47,It can't do.
00:21:47,00:21:50,"It feels like we'd know about it, wouldn't we, if everyone was doing that."
00:21:50,00:21:52,"Like, Germany's a serious industrial life country."
00:21:52,00:21:55,There simply isn't the time for people to take time off to do this.
00:21:55,00:21:59,"But it's a good way of finding love, I suppose, you know, if you don't want to go on the"
00:21:59,00:22:00,apps.
00:22:00,00:22:01,"Oh, my goodness."
00:22:01,00:22:07,"Germans, yes, big into birthdays, big into child's birthdays, big into childhood."
00:22:07,00:22:11,I feel like Germany invented childhood in the kinder in the late 18th century.
00:22:11,00:22:17,"And in fact, the earliest birthday celebration I could find in Germany was in 1801, and it"
00:22:17,00:22:23,"was Goethe describing it of, you know, Germany's answer to Shakespeare fame and friend of the"
00:22:23,00:22:24,podcast.
00:22:24,00:22:29,And he was describing the birthday cake of Prince August of Saxgotha Altenberg.
00:22:29,00:22:34,"And he described it as a generous talk with colorful flaming candles amounting to 50 candles,"
00:22:34,00:22:36,which was for how old he was.
00:22:36,00:22:40,"So that's like the first time we have, you've got the number of candles to go with your"
00:22:40,00:22:42,age on a cake.
00:22:42,00:22:47,"But he said that was weird, because usually in children's festivities of this kind, you"
00:22:47,00:22:49,have a number of candles indicating your upcoming years.
00:22:49,00:22:55,"Oh, and I found a couple of others also saying the candles on the cake would be the number"
00:22:55,00:22:57,of years you're estimated to have.
00:22:57,00:22:59,"But life expectancy in those days was quite low, wasn't it?"
00:22:59,00:23:01,"So you didn't have to blow out as many, yeah."
00:23:01,00:23:02,"It must have been a bit of a shock, wouldn't it?"
00:23:02,00:23:04,You see the cake coming out of the kitchen.
00:23:04,00:23:07,Why are there only four candles on there?
00:23:07,00:23:08,"Wow, that's amazing."
00:23:08,00:23:09,"I know, I know."
00:23:09,00:23:10,Omniscient.
00:23:10,00:23:12,You've always got to guess.
00:23:12,00:23:13,Birthday songs.
00:23:13,00:23:15,There's obviously a happy birthday song.
00:23:15,00:23:18,What would you say is the most famous other birthday party song?
00:23:18,00:23:21,Happy birthday to your shawty.
00:23:21,00:23:22,It's your birthday.
00:23:22,00:23:23,Okay.
00:23:23,00:23:24,There's so many.
00:23:24,00:23:25,I wasn't expecting that.
00:23:25,00:23:27,It's my party and I cry if I want to.
00:23:27,00:23:28,Leslie Gore.
00:23:28,00:23:29,Leslie Gore.
00:23:29,00:23:30,Incredible song.
00:23:30,00:23:31,Gorgeous song.
00:23:31,00:23:35,"And so I'd never properly, I know the chorus never properly listened to the lyrics."
00:23:35,00:23:38,It's about the singer Leslie Gore in the story.
00:23:38,00:23:39,She is at a party.
00:23:39,00:23:40,We should say 60s singer.
00:23:40,00:23:41,Yeah.
00:23:41,00:23:42,People who haven't heard of her these days.
00:23:42,00:23:43,Yeah.
00:23:43,00:23:44,Brilliant singer.
00:23:44,00:23:45,She's a brilliant singer.
00:23:45,00:23:47,And I'll cry if I want to.
00:23:47,00:23:48,Exactly.
00:23:48,00:23:49,And she was about 14 when that came out.
00:23:49,00:23:50,She was so young.
00:23:50,00:23:51,She was so young.
00:23:51,00:23:54,"And so the story is about her boyfriend, Johnny, disappearing from her birthday party, comes"
00:23:54,00:23:59,"back with a girl called Judy and she's wearing his ring and it's this whole horrible thing,"
00:23:59,00:24:00,right?
00:24:00,00:24:01,Did it really happen to Leslie?
00:24:01,00:24:02,Yeah.
00:24:02,00:24:06,"It kind of happened to one of the songwriters, but it was his daughter being upset that her"
00:24:06,00:24:09,grandparents had been invited to the party and she was crying.
00:24:09,00:24:11,And then he turned it into a more of a love triangle thing.
00:24:11,00:24:12,Okay.
00:24:12,00:24:13,Here's the interesting thing though.
00:24:13,00:24:17,There was a sequel to that song called Judy's Turn to Cry.
00:24:17,00:24:23,And so it's a follow on where Johnny then sees Leslie Gore kissing someone at that party
00:24:23,00:24:26,and he gets jealous and he punches the guy and he goes back.
00:24:26,00:24:28,"Dan, can I get, can I show you guys something on my phone?"
00:24:28,00:24:29,Yeah.
00:24:29,00:24:30,Yeah.
00:24:30,00:24:34,"So Andy's gone over to the cell for, he's pulled out some what sits and it's not that"
00:24:34,00:24:36,that he needs.
00:24:36,00:24:40,"He's pulled out, what's that, some greens of some sort up there's his phone."
00:24:40,00:24:41,Okay.
00:24:41,00:24:44,"If this is just you on holiday last week, then you've got to save it."
00:24:44,00:24:45,This series of phone isn't me crying.
00:24:45,00:24:49,"No, I have this album on my phone."
00:24:49,00:24:53,I'm a big fan and she released an entire album of crying based songs off the back of this
00:24:53,00:24:54,hit.
00:24:54,00:24:55,"Oh, wow."
00:24:55,00:24:56,I'll cry if I want to.
00:24:56,00:25:00,"The tracks are Cry Me a River, Cry, Just Let Me Cry."
00:25:00,00:25:04,"Cry and You Cry Alone, No More Tears, Judy's Turn to Cry."
00:25:04,00:25:05,Yep.
00:25:05,00:25:06,I understand.
00:25:06,00:25:07,I would.
00:25:07,00:25:08,"Misty, probably about crying."
00:25:08,00:25:09,What kind of fool am I?
00:25:09,00:25:10,And the party's over.
00:25:10,00:25:13,"Andy, is this your Spotify raps every year?"
00:25:13,00:25:14,It's a cracking album.
00:25:14,00:25:18,"But it is amazing that they basically went, this single is such a hit."
00:25:18,00:25:19,You are now our cry singer.
00:25:19,00:25:20,Yeah.
00:25:20,00:25:21,And let's do a whole album of it.
00:25:21,00:25:22,Yeah.
00:25:22,00:25:26,And then there must have been a shift because there was one song which you mentioned there
00:25:26,00:25:29,"on that album, which is what kind of fool am I?"
00:25:29,00:25:30,Oh yeah.
00:25:30,00:25:34,"So her follow-up album, that was clearly a hit, is basically songs would fall in the"
00:25:34,00:25:35,title.
00:25:35,00:25:37,She's a fool.
00:25:37,00:25:38,My foolish heart.
00:25:38,00:25:39,She's latching onto the wrong thing.
00:25:39,00:25:40,Young foolish.
00:25:40,00:25:43,You haven't got a number one because of the vocabulary you've used in your title.
00:25:43,00:25:47,"And Quincy Jones was the producer, which is why it's such an amazing sound."
00:25:47,00:25:49,"But yeah, what an amazing story."
00:25:49,00:25:51,It's like a diss track sequel.
00:25:51,00:25:52,It's so strange.
00:25:52,00:25:53,"She's the Kendrick Lamar of her own day, of her own song."
00:25:53,00:25:54,I don't get that.
00:25:54,00:25:55,Okay.
00:25:55,00:25:56,And it's more of a Drake fan.
00:25:56,00:26:01,"I feel like we haven't innovated any birthday stuff, our generation."
00:26:01,00:26:02,We've not moved the birthday along at all.
00:26:02,00:26:05,"Oh, well, your generation hasn't, but what's your favorite birthday game?"
00:26:05,00:26:07,I don't really have any favorite birthday games.
00:26:07,00:26:08,Just name it one.
00:26:08,00:26:09,Pass the Barter.
00:26:09,00:26:10,Pass the Barter.
00:26:10,00:26:11,It's both rubbish.
00:26:11,00:26:14,I like the one where you go through the Times birthday announcements guessing the age of
00:26:14,00:26:17,the celebrities and public figures whose birthdays are listed in that.
00:26:17,00:26:18,"What, the Richard Osmond birthday game?"
00:26:18,00:26:20,I do play that daily.
00:26:20,00:26:26,"Well, like I said, if you ask most adults, 67% of people will say that past the past"
00:26:26,00:26:32,was one of their favorite party games and 61% will say musical chairs.
00:26:32,00:26:36,"But in young children today, or in fact, this was 10 years ago."
00:26:36,00:26:42,"So this was a study in 2009, 31% of children age four to seven said they liked past the"
00:26:42,00:26:46,parcel and only 19% said they liked musical chairs.
00:26:46,00:26:51,And they said that their favorite was playing the Nintendo Wii and the Sony PlayStation.
00:26:51,00:26:53,I'm with them.
00:26:53,00:27:04,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Anna."
00:27:04,00:27:08,My fact this week is that saffron was invented by humans.
00:27:08,00:27:10,I thought this is really interesting.
00:27:10,00:27:15,I didn't know that saffron is in the very expensive spice that we can eat.
00:27:15,00:27:20,"Cannot grow in the wild at all, it cannot reproduce without humans intervening."
00:27:20,00:27:22,"So it's all propagated, harvested manually."
00:27:22,00:27:26,"And that's been the case for thousands of years, and there's no wild equivalent."
00:27:26,00:27:31,"There's something that people call wild saffron, which we think maybe it originally came from"
00:27:31,00:27:33,a mutation of that.
00:27:33,00:27:39,"But basically about 4,000 years ago, maybe in Crete, maybe in Persia, some people, I"
00:27:39,00:27:44,"guess, found a mutated wild crocus and then tried hand breeding it with another one."
00:27:44,00:27:46,And it came up with saffron.
00:27:46,00:27:50,"And then since then for 4,000 years, we've been having to hand pollinate or hand breed"
00:27:50,00:27:51,saffron.
00:27:51,00:27:52,Is that the thing?
00:27:52,00:27:53,"It doesn't make seeds, yes."
00:27:53,00:27:59,"So it all has to be propagated with the bulb, which blossoms into lots of little bits underground."
00:27:59,00:28:01,"It's called a quorum, isn't it?"
00:28:01,00:28:02,"A quorum, yes."
00:28:02,00:28:04,"It's like a bulb, but it's basically, it's very similar to a bulb."
00:28:04,00:28:09,"And they grow little offshoots, and you just pinch those off for replanting."
00:28:09,00:28:11,"But yeah, is this why it's so expensive?"
00:28:11,00:28:12,Yes.
00:28:12,00:28:14,"Yeah, it's quite labor-intensive, isn't it?"
00:28:14,00:28:18,"Having to dig up every saffron bit, pluck some quorms off, replant them."
00:28:18,00:28:21,And also because you need a lot of flowers to get not much saffron running.
00:28:21,00:28:22,There's shed loads.
00:28:22,00:28:27,"Each one grows three of these little bits, which are basically the stigma, the stigma"
00:28:27,00:28:28,of the female bit of a plant.
00:28:28,00:28:30,That's what the red threads are.
00:28:30,00:28:31,Each one has three of them.
00:28:31,00:28:36,"It needs 200,000 flowers to produce one kilogram of dried saffron threads."
00:28:36,00:28:40,"And 200,000 flowers is the same as the entire number of flowers used at the World Cup of"
00:28:40,00:28:43,Florets in Manchester in 2023.
00:28:43,00:28:45,That puts it into perspective.
00:28:45,00:28:48,"Well, it was the hundredth year of the competition, which is like..."
00:28:48,00:28:50,"You don't need to tell me, Jax."
00:28:50,00:28:53,"And of course, like, being a World Cup, the Germans won."
00:28:53,00:28:54,"Oh, really?"
00:28:54,00:28:55,"Yeah, yeah."
00:28:55,00:28:57,It's an amazing process.
00:28:57,00:28:58,It's so weird.
00:28:58,00:28:59,It's so weird.
00:28:59,00:29:00,And very time-consuming.
00:29:00,00:29:04,"So you hand-pick the flowers, and then you pick out the three bright red threads."
00:29:04,00:29:10,"And then you dry them out, and then they lose about 80% of their weight in the drying process."
00:29:10,00:29:12,So you've got almost nothing left of them.
00:29:12,00:29:16,"And then you press those threads into a cake, I believe, or you can do, to pack it."
00:29:16,00:29:17,"Oh, right."
00:29:17,00:29:18,Yeah.
00:29:18,00:29:20,"But like, quite often, you'll just buy them."
00:29:20,00:29:24,"If you go to a souk in Morocco or something, they'll just be a little sort of..."
00:29:24,00:29:26,It's almost like a petri dish with the men.
00:29:26,00:29:27,Yeah.
00:29:27,00:29:28,Have you heard of bastard saffron?
00:29:28,00:29:29,Oh.
00:29:29,00:29:35,"Bastard saffron is fake saffron, which obviously is very profitable, because even if you're"
00:29:35,00:29:40,"selling it cheaper than saffron, it can be ground petals of calendula or safflower."
00:29:40,00:29:42,"So they look a bit similar, I suppose."
00:29:42,00:29:45,Maybe you had in some beef fibres or bits of Brazil nuts.
00:29:45,00:29:46,"Also quite expensive, actually."
00:29:46,00:29:47,Yes.
00:29:47,00:29:49,But it's not cheap.
00:29:49,00:29:53,"And then you store it in a damp location, and it gains a bit of weight, sort of absorbs"
00:29:53,00:29:54,a bit of water from the air.
00:29:54,00:29:55,It does end up looking...
00:29:55,00:29:56,Does it taste like saffron?
00:29:56,00:29:57,No.
00:29:57,00:29:58,Even though beef fibres are contributing to the saffron?
00:29:58,00:29:59,No.
00:29:59,00:30:00,You're being swizzed.
00:30:00,00:30:01,Yeah.
00:30:01,00:30:04,But Pliny recommends two methods to identify whether or not something's real saffron.
00:30:04,00:30:08,"One, you press the threads, and if they crackle, then it's not saffron."
00:30:08,00:30:12,"And secondly, you touch it on your face, and if it is saffron, it'll sting you a tiny"
00:30:12,00:30:13,bit.
00:30:13,00:30:14,And is this true?
00:30:14,00:30:15,Yeah.
00:30:15,00:30:16,Oh.
00:30:16,00:30:17,It's not true.
00:30:17,00:30:18,He also said it was an aphrodisiac.
00:30:18,00:30:19,Is it not?
00:30:19,00:30:20,No.
00:30:20,00:30:21,Nothing is.
00:30:21,00:30:22,"Everything's claimed, and nothing is."
00:30:22,00:30:23,"Well, they say, yeah."
00:30:23,00:30:27,So the famous thing that will be mentioned is Cleopatra would use saffron-infused baths
00:30:27,00:30:30,to sort of get her loins going and get into it.
00:30:30,00:30:32,"Did she not have baths of milk, Cleopatra?"
00:30:32,00:30:35,"She did, with saffron, also as part of it, yeah."
00:30:35,00:30:38,I thought something that was really interesting about a saffron was just how unbelievably
00:30:38,00:30:40,widespread it is in meals across the world.
00:30:40,00:30:44,"Like, it doesn't seem to have a country or a region or even a continent that it's fixed"
00:30:44,00:30:45,to.
00:30:45,00:30:52,"So we've managed paella, Indian dishes in South America now and European dishes, and"
00:30:52,00:30:53,we seem to have been using it for ages.
00:30:53,00:31:00,"It's reached us about 2,000 years ago in Britain even, and we even have saffron-waldon,"
00:31:00,00:31:05,"the place, which is named after it, and that was back in the 16th century."
00:31:05,00:31:06,"It's in Essex, isn't it?"
00:31:06,00:31:07,Yes.
00:31:07,00:31:13,And they changed the town seal to a picture of three saffron plants surrounded by a wall
00:31:13,00:31:16,because saffron walled in.
00:31:16,00:31:17,"Oh, nice."
00:31:17,00:31:18,Very nice.
00:31:18,00:31:19,"It was called something else, walled in before."
00:31:19,00:31:20,It was called magna-waldon.
00:31:20,00:31:21,Magna-waldon.
00:31:21,00:31:24,And they're also known for their lavender in saffron.
00:31:24,00:31:25,Really?
00:31:25,00:31:32,"Yeah, Ian Lavender, who played Pike on Dead's Army, is listed as a notable resident in this"
00:31:32,00:31:33,time.
00:31:33,00:31:35,"Saffron growers, croakers, called croakers."
00:31:35,00:31:37,"Oh, because a saffron is a type of crocus."
00:31:37,00:31:38,Because it's a type of crocus?
00:31:38,00:31:39,Is that why they're getting it?
00:31:39,00:31:40,I assume that's where it came from.
00:31:40,00:31:44,They were known as the worst complainers of two-to-times.
00:31:44,00:31:47,Because of the labour-intensiveness of the work?
00:31:47,00:31:49,"Basically, they were always complaining about the price."
00:31:49,00:31:53,"It was written in a book about the table on a history of food, and it said, ""The croakers,"
00:31:53,00:31:55,"if the yield's too big, they complain."
00:31:55,00:31:58,"If the yield's too small, they complain that they can't grow enough."""
00:31:58,00:32:01,"I see, because if the yield's too big, then the price goes down."
00:32:01,00:32:02,Exactly.
00:32:02,00:32:04,"If the yield's too small, then they just don't have anything to sell."
00:32:04,00:32:05,Exactly.
00:32:05,00:32:09,"And so much so that by the 19th century, the word ""croaker"" was a word for a grumbler"
00:32:09,00:32:10,or a moaner.
00:32:10,00:32:11,Really?
00:32:11,00:32:12,Brilliant.
00:32:12,00:32:13,"Don't be a croaker, mate."
00:32:13,00:32:14,Can I tell you about a complaining croaker?
00:32:14,00:32:15,Yeah.
00:32:15,00:32:18,"This is from 1556, and it's about saffron walden."
00:32:18,00:32:24,Such was the plenty of saffron in this year that the murmuring croakers envying the store
00:32:24,00:32:30,"said in blasphemous manner in and about walden in Essex that, ""God did now shite saffron."""
00:32:30,00:32:34,That's good.
00:32:34,00:32:41,"The colour saffron, always like an orange colour, is on the flag of India, and it denotes disinterestedness."
00:32:41,00:32:42,What?
00:32:42,00:32:43,Yeah.
00:32:43,00:32:44,Why?
00:32:44,00:32:51,It's because the leaders of India must be indifferent to material gains and dedicate themselves
00:32:51,00:32:52,to their work.
00:32:52,00:32:55,"So, wait, is the saffron representing material gains or the work?"
00:32:55,00:33:00,It's because it's so labour-intensive to pick saffron that you need to be dedicated in
00:33:00,00:33:04,"order to pick that saffron, and you dedicate yourself to your work instead of material"
00:33:04,00:33:05,gains.
00:33:05,00:33:06,That makes sense.
00:33:06,00:33:07,That's very cool.
00:33:07,00:33:09,Do you know what a saffron massages?
00:33:09,00:33:12,It feels like one could guess.
00:33:12,00:33:13,It's expensive.
00:33:13,00:33:14,It's expensive.
00:33:14,00:33:16,You tickle someone with those little saffron heads.
00:33:16,00:33:21,You get massaged in three very specific spots as if they were plucking the three logs out.
00:33:21,00:33:22,Interesting.
00:33:22,00:33:26,"When I tell you what it is, you can decide yourself who was closest."
00:33:26,00:33:32,"It's another word for what we would call scissoring between two lesbians, and it was written"
00:33:32,00:33:39,"by 13th century Tunisian poet Shahib Aldin Ahmed Al-Tafashi, who was writing about lesbianism"
00:33:39,00:33:45,"in the 13th century, North Africa, and he wrote about this community headed by a woman"
00:33:45,00:33:48,named Rose who was all doing this saffron massage.
00:33:48,00:33:49,What?
00:33:49,00:33:52,The saffron massage?
00:33:52,00:33:56,"So it's just, maybe it's because two legs look like one when you've got the four legs"
00:33:56,00:33:57,together.
00:33:57,00:33:58,So it looks like a three legged thing.
00:33:58,00:33:59,It could be.
00:33:59,00:34:00,You know what?
00:34:00,00:34:05,"I could have worked out for all my googling, exactly where this came from."
00:34:05,00:34:10,"But I can tell you that the ancient medieval Arabic term for lesbians was Suhaqiyat, which"
00:34:10,00:34:11,meant rubbers.
00:34:11,00:34:12,Really?
00:34:12,00:34:13,People who rub things together.
00:34:13,00:34:15,"Oh, that makes sense."
00:34:15,00:34:20,And it was believed that lesbianism was due to a hot itch in the genitals that could only
00:34:20,00:34:22,be cured by rubbing clitoris to clitoris.
00:34:22,00:34:27,Can't hold that.
00:34:27,00:34:33,The idea was that heterosexual sex created a hot orgasm and lesbian sex produced a cold
00:34:33,00:34:34,orgasm.
00:34:34,00:34:37,And so the cold would be against the hot itch and that would cure it.
00:34:37,00:34:38,"Oh, okay."
00:34:38,00:34:42,"Whatever you've got to tell yourself, tell the police."
00:34:42,00:34:43,And your husband.
00:34:43,00:34:44,Yeah.
00:34:44,00:34:49,"Well, on the, just running on the sexual theme for a second, in 1967, saffron had quite a"
00:34:49,00:34:54,big moment in America as a result of Donovan and a song called Mellow Yellow.
00:34:54,00:34:55,Off.
00:34:55,00:34:56,Yeah.
00:34:56,00:34:57,Back to Mandy's.
00:34:57,00:34:58,Let me take out my Donovan.
00:34:58,00:34:59,"Yeah, yeah."
00:34:59,00:35:00,"Donovan, it's back to you."
00:35:00,00:35:01,"Go on, Mellow Yellow."
00:35:01,00:35:02,It's a great song.
00:35:02,00:35:03,"Yeah, absolutely awesome."
00:35:03,00:35:07,"Well, there's a line that opens it, which is I'm just mad about saffron."
00:35:07,00:35:08,Saffron's mad about me.
00:35:08,00:35:12,"And no one knew at the time if he was talking about the spice, if he was talking about a"
00:35:12,00:35:17,"woman who was called saffron, there was a rumour went around that it was smoking banana"
00:35:17,00:35:18,skin.
00:35:18,00:35:21,"And that's sort of like, yeah, getting off on that."
00:35:21,00:35:27,"Mellow Yellow actually appears in one of James Joyce's books, Ulysses."
00:35:27,00:35:29,It's a description of Molly Bloom's buttocks.
00:35:29,00:35:30,So that's what Mellow Yellow is.
00:35:30,00:35:31,Wow.
00:35:31,00:35:33,So he describes her buttocks as Mellow Yellow.
00:35:33,00:35:34,And then it's coincidence that there was a thought.
00:35:34,00:35:38,"I think that's a coincidence because he doesn't, I don't think he said that that's why."
00:35:38,00:35:42,But what he says is where he got the idea for the song was when he saw an advert for a
00:35:42,00:35:48,"yellow vibrator and there was the line, electrical banana is going to be a sudden craze."
00:35:48,00:35:49,"And so yeah, Mellow Yellow is..."
00:35:49,00:35:51,"Well, that's the line of the song, isn't it?"
00:35:51,00:35:52,Yeah.
00:35:52,00:35:54,So then he came up with Mellow Yellow because he thought that was a good description of
00:35:54,00:35:56,"what this vibrator might achieve for you, a Mellow Yellow."
00:35:56,00:35:59,"I think in most of these cases, it's just Mellow Rives with Yellow."
00:35:59,00:36:00,Yeah.
00:36:00,00:36:01,Exactly.
00:36:01,00:36:02,It's quite a nice phrase.
00:36:02,00:36:03,And it's just floating a lot of theories here.
00:36:03,00:36:04,I don't even know.
00:36:04,00:36:05,Yeah.
00:36:05,00:36:06,I'm just saying what people have thought.
00:36:06,00:36:08,But saffron got a moment off the back of it.
00:36:08,00:36:09,Did it?
00:36:09,00:36:10,Did it sales?
00:36:10,00:36:11,Do we have it sales?
00:36:11,00:36:12,Sort of rocket skyrocketed.
00:36:12,00:36:15,The croakers were furious.
00:36:15,00:36:18,You know that gardening books used to rhyme.
00:36:18,00:36:19,So this is really good.
00:36:19,00:36:23,I was reading about instructions of how you plant saffron and how you grow it.
00:36:23,00:36:28,"And there's a 1440s book, The Feet of Gardening, which is by John Gardner."
00:36:28,00:36:29,Very nice.
00:36:29,00:36:30,Very lovely.
00:36:30,00:36:32,So here's an example.
00:36:32,00:36:36,"With a dibble, thou shall them set, that the dibble before be blunt and gret."
00:36:36,00:36:40,"Three inches deep they must set be, and thus master John Gardner said to me."
00:36:40,00:36:42,Was he Indian?
00:36:42,00:36:44,"No, no, no."
00:36:44,00:36:47,What was that accent there?
00:36:47,00:36:48,It was such a weird one.
00:36:48,00:36:49,It was old-timey.
00:36:49,00:36:50,So you're holding this.
00:36:50,00:36:51,That's old.
00:36:51,00:36:52,Old ancient Syrian.
00:36:52,00:36:54,"So you put your dibble in the ground, which makes a hole."
00:36:54,00:36:55,"It's like a log stick, right?"
00:36:55,00:36:56,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:36:56,00:36:57,And it has to be three inches.
00:36:57,00:37:02,And basically it's for people who are not literate to remember gardening instructions
00:37:02,00:37:03,is better.
00:37:03,00:37:04,That's great.
00:37:04,00:37:05,"A big faff writing the books though, isn't it?"
00:37:05,00:37:06,"Oh, yeah."
00:37:06,00:37:10,"If you can't make the rhyme work, then you just have to tell people to plant everything"
00:37:10,00:37:11,in December.
00:37:11,00:37:13,And it's just as a nightmare.
00:37:13,00:37:16,I think so many months' rhyme with December on.
00:37:16,00:37:18,I think the words are wrong.
00:37:18,00:37:19,Sorry.
00:37:19,00:37:24,"That's the worst gardening writer, 15th century multidontist."
00:37:24,00:37:26,I can't think of a rhyme for November.
00:37:26,00:37:30,Is that why no oranges were grown in that period as well?
00:37:30,00:37:31,Yeah.
00:37:31,00:37:38,"Users of saffron in the old days, saffron in breast milk is good for eye complaints."
00:37:38,00:37:41,According to him.
00:37:41,00:37:42,Perverts.
00:37:42,00:37:45,Good for seasickness.
00:37:45,00:37:46,Great for plague.
00:37:46,00:37:48,It really perks you up if you've got plague.
00:37:48,00:37:52,"Nones would send their veils with saffron to perk themselves up a bit, apparently."
00:37:52,00:37:53,Okay.
00:37:53,00:37:54,But there's also this thing.
00:37:54,00:37:55,Have you heard of a philosopher's egg?
00:37:55,00:37:56,I know.
00:37:56,00:38:01,"So you get an egg, make a hole in the top, take out the stuff, and then you fill the"
00:38:01,00:38:06,"shell with saffron, then you roast the shell and the saffron together in charcoal's until"
00:38:06,00:38:08,the shell becomes yellow.
00:38:08,00:38:12,Then you beat it all together in a mortar with some mustard seed.
00:38:12,00:38:17,"Then you, as soon as any suspicion is had of infection, dissolve the weight of a French"
00:38:17,00:38:23,"crown of that stuff in 10 spoonfuls of posset ale, drink it lukewarm and sweat upon it in"
00:38:23,00:38:25,"your naked bed, and then you become immortal."
00:38:25,00:38:28,Isn't that good?
00:38:28,00:38:29,That's good.
00:38:29,00:38:32,"Is the idea that they just make it so complicated that if you die, they're like, ""Oh, I just"
00:38:32,00:38:33,"didn't do it right."""
00:38:33,00:38:34,"Yeah, exactly."
00:38:34,00:38:35,Yeah.
00:38:35,00:38:38,And then nine spoonfuls of posset ale.
00:38:38,00:38:41,Put one extra candle on it.
00:38:41,00:38:43,Ancient Egyptians used saffron.
00:38:43,00:38:44,They used them in their head cones.
00:38:44,00:38:49,"I wasn't really familiar with these ancient Egyptian head cones, but they're very cool."
00:38:49,00:38:50,Like a dunce's cap?
00:38:50,00:38:53,It's sort of a more sexy version of a dunce's cap.
00:38:53,00:38:56,What could be more sexy than a dunce's cap?
00:38:56,00:38:57,Come on.
00:38:57,00:38:59,Let's get in the corner of the room together.
00:38:59,00:39:00,Okay.
00:39:00,00:39:01,Face the wall.
00:39:01,00:39:09,"It's not here anymore about your Catholic school days, James."
00:39:09,00:39:17,That's what I say when I want the D. I'm referring to the letter on the code.
00:39:17,00:39:20,This was head cones that were scented.
00:39:20,00:39:25,So there are lots of images in tombs of people entering parties wearing these cones.
00:39:25,00:39:29,"Or you'd actually go to a party as an ancient Egyptian, if you're a posh one, and you'd"
00:39:29,00:39:32,"be given a head cone, a bit like being given a cocktail or a canapé at the start."
00:39:32,00:39:38,"You'd be given a head cone, which was made of ox tallow, which was a sort of fax-y wax,"
00:39:38,00:39:42,"infused with saffron, and over the course of the evening, the heat of your body would melt"
00:39:42,00:39:43,it gradually.
00:39:43,00:39:47,"So, and as it ran down your face, you'd emit the scent of saffron."
00:39:47,00:39:48,It's so weird.
00:39:48,00:39:49,Yeah.
00:39:49,00:39:50,It's incredible.
00:39:50,00:39:51,That's bizarre.
00:39:51,00:39:52,Delicious.
00:39:52,00:39:53,I've never heard of that before.
00:39:53,00:39:54,Who doesn't like the smell of beef-jipping?
00:39:54,00:39:55,Come on.
00:39:55,00:39:56,"I mean, I'm from the North."
00:39:56,00:39:57,So obviously I do like that.
00:39:57,00:39:58,And that's who they were targeting.
00:39:58,00:39:59,People from Bolton.
00:39:59,00:40:01,And everyone gets one.
00:40:01,00:40:03,"Everyone at the party, I think, gets one."
00:40:03,00:40:04,Yeah.
00:40:04,00:40:05,You'd have a servant come up and pop your head.
00:40:05,00:40:06,"Oh, I'm sorry."
00:40:06,00:40:08,"I'm doing non-beefy January, I'm afraid."
00:40:08,00:40:13,You have a vegan cone.
00:40:13,00:40:17,OK.
00:40:17,00:40:21,"It is time for our final fact of the show, and that is my fact."
00:40:21,00:40:27,"My fact this week is that in order to achieve tears in a scene, actors are often shot in"
00:40:27,00:40:29,the face with a crying stick.
00:40:29,00:40:30,OK.
00:40:30,00:40:35,Why don't they get our Andy Spotify playlist?
00:40:35,00:40:42,"So I saw this in quite a few places now, where it's a behind-the-scenes trick of the trade,"
00:40:42,00:40:46,"whereby if an actor needs to cry in a scene, but they can't force themselves to bring up"
00:40:46,00:40:51,"real tears, you have a few methods available to you, one of which is this crying stick,"
00:40:51,00:40:59,which you point at the eye of someone and you blow a sort of methanol odor into their
00:40:59,00:41:00,eye.
00:41:00,00:41:01,Mental.
00:41:01,00:41:02,"Sorry, sorry."
00:41:02,00:41:03,Mental.
00:41:03,00:41:04,Ah!
00:41:04,00:41:05,"Well, it's just crying."
00:41:05,00:41:06,OK.
00:41:06,00:41:09,Can you tile it down a bit?
00:41:09,00:41:16,So why did your crying stick business get a blast at?
00:41:16,00:41:17,OK.
00:41:17,00:41:18,Mental.
00:41:18,00:41:21,And it creates tears.
00:41:21,00:41:26,"And it's quite nice because it's not immediate tears, they sort of arrive, I guess, once"
00:41:26,00:41:30,"the director would say action, they sort of gradually appear, and so you can probably"
00:41:30,00:41:31,time it perfectly.
00:41:31,00:41:33,"So what you're talking about there is a tear-blower, I think."
00:41:33,00:41:34,Yeah.
00:41:34,00:41:40,"So there's the crylon 3000 tear-blower, Nigel Beauty's Metfol tear-blower that are available"
00:41:40,00:41:44,"if you go to specialist shops, but there's also a tear-stick, which is basically like"
00:41:44,00:41:49,"a lipstick thing, which you kind of rub on your eyes and does the same job, but doesn't"
00:41:49,00:41:50,have the blower.
00:41:50,00:41:51,"So you don't put it on your bottom eyelid, actually."
00:41:51,00:41:55,"Don't put it on your eye because there's different methods, aren't there?"
00:41:55,00:41:56,"Oh, there are so many."
00:41:56,00:42:02,"The craziest one that I read is that stage actors, they'll keep a pair of tweezers on"
00:42:02,00:42:08,them and they will pull a nostril hair out on both sides in order to get both eyes crying.
00:42:08,00:42:10,"Just a good beefy tug on those, that'll do."
00:42:10,00:42:11,Yeah.
00:42:11,00:42:13,"Kate Grandchette talks about this, she says on stage that would be a method that you would"
00:42:13,00:42:14,do.
00:42:14,00:42:15,Absolutely.
00:42:15,00:42:16,"Does it work, really?"
00:42:16,00:42:19,"Because I feel like I've tried that, but if I feel like it's mentioned in a sitcom,"
00:42:19,00:42:20,I've tried it.
00:42:20,00:42:22,Does that make your eyes water?
00:42:22,00:42:23,I've never tried it.
00:42:23,00:42:25,"If you get a good old deep-rooted one, it works, alright."
00:42:25,00:42:26,OK.
00:42:26,00:42:30,"In fact, a lot of great actors will have a tiny piece of thread going to the front row of"
00:42:30,00:42:33,"the stalls where a member of the production company will be sitting, so they don't have"
00:42:33,00:42:34,to pluck it themselves.
00:42:34,00:42:35,"OK, yeah."
00:42:35,00:42:37,"And at a certain moment, they'll just give a yank on the rod."
00:42:37,00:42:39,"That does feel like the problem with a lot of these, right?"
00:42:39,00:42:43,"If you are doing a play, for instance, having to have someone sprint on with a crying stick"
00:42:43,00:42:45,and blow in your face halfway through the scene.
00:42:45,00:42:46,"Yeah, exactly."
00:42:46,00:42:47,Or it's also filmed in a long shot.
00:42:47,00:42:52,It feels like it will be very hard to puff a blow of mental into your eye from a distance.
00:42:52,00:42:53,Yeah.
00:42:53,00:42:56,"That's the reason that the stick is quite useful, because you can sort of hide it about"
00:42:56,00:42:58,your person and then just shove it in there.
00:42:58,00:43:00,"Well also, how many nostril hairs do you have?"
00:43:00,00:43:02,"If you're in a long-running play, that is..."
00:43:02,00:43:03,They regrow.
00:43:03,00:43:08,"And as you get older, more and more, they regrow more quickly."
00:43:08,00:43:11,"My friend, Diva, who's an actor, she said that she had a friend who would ask you to"
00:43:11,00:43:15,"list anything bad that had happened to you in your life, and they would read it and they"
00:43:15,00:43:18,would use that to make them cry.
00:43:18,00:43:19,They'd read it to the person who created the list.
00:43:19,00:43:22,"No, they would think about the bad things that had happened to you."
00:43:22,00:43:26,"So if you and I are in a scene and I want to cry, I think about the bad things that have"
00:43:26,00:43:28,happened to you and that will make me cry.
00:43:28,00:43:29,What?
00:43:29,00:43:30,"That's very empathetic of you, isn't it?"
00:43:30,00:43:31,It's very empathetic.
00:43:31,00:43:34,I would only laugh if I hear that bad things happening to other people.
00:43:34,00:43:39,"That sounds like a you problem, you know?"
00:43:39,00:43:41,And then you're crying with laughter.
00:43:41,00:43:42,"Yes, yes, yes."
00:43:42,00:43:46,"There's quite a common thing as you think about a bad thing that's happened to you,"
00:43:46,00:43:47,right?
00:43:47,00:43:48,Probably the most common way of doing it.
00:43:48,00:43:49,That's the Stanislavski way of doing it.
00:43:49,00:43:52,"Right, but for someone else, there's only the bad things that have happened to them."
00:43:52,00:43:58,"Or there's a thing where you put, if I'm acting in a scene with you, Dan, I will put you in"
00:43:58,00:43:59,"a scene from my life, if you know what I mean."
00:43:59,00:44:04,"Like, I'll imagine someone telling me that they're ill and then I'll think, okay, I'll"
00:44:04,00:44:06,sort of recast you as that person in my life.
00:44:06,00:44:09,Imagine someone walking in with one candle on Dan's birthday cake.
00:44:09,00:44:10,"Exactly, exactly."
00:44:10,00:44:13,There are some things that I just can't believe work.
00:44:13,00:44:18,The Toronto Film School website has a few tips and I tried the only one that was low
00:44:18,00:44:24,"effort the yawning method, which was take a deep breath and slowly exhale while faking"
00:44:24,00:44:29,"a yawn, but keep your lips tightly pursed, which is where it becomes a bit more hard."
00:44:29,00:44:33,And then focus the yawn in the back of your throat like you're trying to swallow your
00:44:33,00:44:34,sadness.
00:44:34,00:44:37,But I found very difficult and hurt my throat quite a lot.
00:44:37,00:44:39,"Okay, so I've just yawned and my eyes are watering a bit."
00:44:39,00:44:41,My eyes are watering as well.
00:44:41,00:44:42,"Guys, you've actually done quite well."
00:44:42,00:44:44,"But there's no tear coming out, but they are watering."
00:44:44,00:44:45,"No, that's good."
00:44:45,00:44:46,I'm convinced.
00:44:46,00:44:49,"But on camera, you want a bit of, you know, that subtle, yeah, that feels like, yeah."
00:44:49,00:44:50,"No, I haven't wiped my eyes."
00:44:50,00:44:51,You're probably crying.
00:44:51,00:44:52,Yeah.
00:44:52,00:44:53,You okay?
00:44:53,00:44:54,Jesus.
00:44:54,00:45:00,I was thinking about something bad that happened to me.
00:45:00,00:45:01,There's other methods.
00:45:01,00:45:03,There's a story of Natalie Wood.
00:45:03,00:45:09,"She had to be able to cry on cue, but her mum solved the issue by ripping up a living"
00:45:09,00:45:12,butterfly in front of her to ensure that she would cry.
00:45:12,00:45:14,"So there's, there's an option."
00:45:14,00:45:18,"They only live for a day, so it's like, you're not really cutting its life that short, are"
00:45:18,00:45:19,you?
00:45:19,00:45:21,"That's a Mayfly, you're thinking of."
00:45:21,00:45:22,Yeah.
00:45:22,00:45:23,"Oh, shit."
00:45:23,00:45:24,Isn't that wild?
00:45:24,00:45:25,That's horrific.
00:45:25,00:45:26,Yeah.
00:45:26,00:45:27,There's another podcast called the rest is entertainment.
00:45:27,00:45:28,Have you guys heard of that?
00:45:28,00:45:29,No.
00:45:29,00:45:30,Okay.
00:45:30,00:45:31,So there's someone on that called Richard Osman.
00:45:31,00:45:32,"Oh, the birthday game guy."
00:45:32,00:45:35,"The birthday game guy, that's him."
00:45:35,00:45:39,And he said they spoke to an actor who said that they don't have to cry on demand.
00:45:39,00:45:41,They don't have to cry anymore because they do it in post on AI.
00:45:41,00:45:43,"Oh, well, they, as in the CGI in."
00:45:43,00:45:44,Yeah.
00:45:44,00:45:48,"So you could, you just kind of go like pull a face of someone who's crying, but you don't"
00:45:48,00:45:51,"have to do the actual tears because they'll, AI will do it."
00:45:51,00:45:52,That's really depressing.
00:45:52,00:45:55,"I reckon a lot of the good actors still cry to silly the real cry, because you want the"
00:45:55,00:45:58,"realistic cry face, don't you?"
00:45:58,00:46:06,"Do you know that Ohio tried to ban fake crying, specifically in court in 2008?"
00:46:06,00:46:08,Why might you try to ban crying in court?
00:46:08,00:46:11,"Well, because it might influence the jury."
00:46:11,00:46:12,Exactly.
00:46:12,00:46:17,"But it was, I think this is really interesting that they've assumed that fake crying exists."
00:46:17,00:46:23,And it was actually based on a case ruling by the Ohio Supreme Court in 1999 that said
00:46:23,00:46:27,it's improper to inflame a jury's emotions by crying.
00:46:27,00:46:33,"And so there was a prosecutor called Jason Filibam, who was prosecuting people who were"
00:46:33,00:46:35,up for the death penalty.
00:46:35,00:46:40,And he complained about the fact that defense attorneys would strategically cry on cue.
00:46:40,00:46:44,"Oh, defense lawyers, not, okay, not people at the dock who might be lawyers."
00:46:44,00:46:45,"No, sorry, defense lawyers."
00:46:45,00:46:48,"So you'd be talking to the jury saying, this man does not deserve to die."
00:46:48,00:46:51,"He's got a wife and kids and, you know, that is quite theatrical."
00:46:51,00:46:53,There's more theatrical than I think a British court would get.
00:46:53,00:46:57,"Well, I think what the defense lawyers say is that they are quite attached to their case"
00:46:57,00:46:59,and they believe strongly in what they're saying.
00:46:59,00:47:02,And they're very sad at the idea that a client might be killed for this.
00:47:02,00:47:06,"I'd love it if they were busted by the court, who's the guy who does the drawings in the"
00:47:06,00:47:07,court.
00:47:07,00:47:11,"Yeah, you could just, there's this drawing that comes out of a lawyer with a tweezer"
00:47:11,00:47:12,up his neck.
00:47:12,00:47:14,"Right, a second."
00:47:14,00:47:19,"Crying goes in and out of fashion, like in the medieval times, it could be a side of"
00:47:19,00:47:20,manliness.
00:47:20,00:47:26,"So if you read all the medieval romance stories of the Knights of Camelot, Galahad is always"
00:47:26,00:47:27,bursting into tears.
00:47:27,00:47:30,"You know, he's always crying and it's seen as a manly thing."
00:47:30,00:47:31,It's a virtue as well.
00:47:31,00:47:34,"You know, they're very strong and powerful, but also they cry a lot and bishops would"
00:47:34,00:47:36,always cry loads.
00:47:36,00:47:40,So there was an archbishop of Canterbury in the 13th century called Winchelsea and he
00:47:40,00:47:43,"wept so much that the altar clots were sodden, supposedly."
00:47:43,00:47:48,"Oh yeah, that's the reason."
00:47:48,00:47:50,We'll pop some sawdust on the altar next time.
00:47:50,00:47:51,It's fine.
00:47:51,00:47:54,"But basically, eyesight was a kind of temptation because eyesight showed you all the sins of"
00:47:54,00:47:58,the world and tears were bad for your eyesight.
00:47:58,00:48:00,You might even lose your eyesight if you cried so much.
00:48:00,00:48:02,"So actually, it was, I mean..."
00:48:02,00:48:03,You'll go blind.
00:48:03,00:48:05,You'll go blind if you keep doing that.
00:48:05,00:48:08,"So a huge part of religious life was weeping because, you know, it might damage your eyesight."
00:48:08,00:48:11,"Like Jesus wept in the Bible, of course."
00:48:11,00:48:12,Yeah.
00:48:12,00:48:13,And so...
00:48:13,00:48:15,Is that so you can go blind to the temptations of the world?
00:48:15,00:48:16,"Kind of, yeah."
00:48:16,00:48:19,"And that was seen as a, you know, that was a very holy thing to do."
00:48:19,00:48:25,"And also you had to be celibate and non-violent, so tears kind of were, they stood in for combat."
00:48:25,00:48:31,"You were in conflict against temptation, particularly sexual temptation, and tears were a part of"
00:48:31,00:48:34,the response to the temptations of the world.
00:48:34,00:48:37,"Like rather than have sex, but it's a kind of thing."
00:48:37,00:48:38,Yeah.
00:48:38,00:48:39,Or listen to a Spotify playlist.
00:48:39,00:48:45,Isn't it a bit of a giveaway if you're sort of standing with your wife and there's a woman
00:48:45,00:48:50,across and you're just filling up with tears because you're trying to not be tempted into
00:48:50,00:48:51,doing something?
00:48:51,00:48:54,"If you're a medieval bishop, you won't be standing with your wife much, look at that."
00:48:54,00:49:00,"The little meme is a bishop and of none, and he's turning out looking at another of none,"
00:49:00,00:49:04,and he's crying his eyes out.
00:49:04,00:49:05,Babies fake crying.
00:49:05,00:49:06,Okay.
00:49:06,00:49:07,Babies fake they're crying quite a lot.
00:49:07,00:49:11,"So some babies are really crying, and you can tell they're really crying if you get to"
00:49:11,00:49:16,"a baby and comfort it and it stays, you know, a little upset for a little while, but sometimes"
00:49:16,00:49:20,"a baby will be crying, and if you go over and sue it, it immediately is..."
00:49:20,00:49:21,It's all smiles.
00:49:21,00:49:22,Yeah.
00:49:22,00:49:26,"And that's not really fake, and I mean, well, I suppose it is a manipulative way."
00:49:26,00:49:31,It is learned that that is a thing to do that prompts a response from a nearby grown-up.
00:49:31,00:49:35,"But I guess in that case, they're crying because they want a grown-up there, so it's kind of"
00:49:35,00:49:36,real.
00:49:36,00:49:37,Like they might feel lonely or...
00:49:37,00:49:38,Completely.
00:49:38,00:49:39,Yeah.
00:49:39,00:49:40,Worrying.
00:49:40,00:49:41,But it's not that proper emotional...
00:49:41,00:49:43,"They're not in distress, but they are making, they're going through the motions of being"
00:49:43,00:49:44,in distress.
00:49:44,00:49:45,"They're pissed off, aren't they?"
00:49:45,00:49:46,They're very strong difference.
00:49:46,00:49:50,It's very evident as soon as you do give them the thing back and they grin.
00:49:50,00:49:56,Other just reasons people cry that aren't to do with being sad.
00:49:56,00:50:00,Mice cry to prove how manly they are.
00:50:00,00:50:05,"And this is because they release pheromones in their tears, and they're an aphrodisiac."
00:50:05,00:50:09,"So quite opposite to humans, where I think there have been studies that show that if"
00:50:09,00:50:15,"human males smell women's tears, it stops them from being sexually aroused."
00:50:15,00:50:18,It's a study that found that.
00:50:18,00:50:23,"Mice get sexually aroused by these pheromones, and they found that contact with tears mean"
00:50:23,00:50:28,"that a female mouse is three times more likely to engage in lordosis, which is that thing"
00:50:28,00:50:33,"where you thrust your rump in the air, asking for someone to have it."
00:50:33,00:50:35,I've never heard that phrase.
00:50:35,00:50:36,Lordosis.
00:50:36,00:50:37,"I know it's a good one, isn't it?"
00:50:37,00:50:38,"Oh, wow."
00:50:38,00:50:41,"Also, have you ever thought of doing chili-cooper audio butts?"
00:50:41,00:50:42,"Oh, yeah."
00:50:42,00:50:43,Have that rump.
00:50:43,00:50:44,Yes.
00:50:44,00:50:54,I have available for voice work.
