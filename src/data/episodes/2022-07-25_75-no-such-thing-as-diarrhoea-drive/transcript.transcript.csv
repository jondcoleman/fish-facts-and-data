00:00:00,00:00:04,The following show you're about to listen to is slightly different to the ones we normally do.
00:00:04,00:00:11,This show was a live one recorded at the Aces and Aids bar in Tofno Park a couple of months ago
00:00:11,00:00:15,"and rather than being our four favourite facts, it was the favourite facts of the audience."
00:00:15,00:00:20,"So we did no prep for this at all, it was the first time we'd heard a lot of these facts"
00:00:20,00:00:24,so it's a bit ropey around the edges but stick with it because we think it's a really funny one
00:00:24,00:00:29,and I hope you will enjoy it. We'll put it out this week in preparation for our
00:00:29,00:00:32,Edinburgh Festival shows which begin next week.
00:00:32,00:00:57,"Hello and welcome to another episode and no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast this week"
00:00:57,00:01:01,coming to you live from the Aces and Aids bar in Tofno Park. My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:01:01,00:01:06,"I am sitting here with Anich Zinsky, James Harkin and Andy Murray and once again we've gathered"
00:01:06,00:01:10,around the microphone but this time it's not with our four favourite facts from the last seven days.
00:01:10,00:01:16,"It's your favourite facts and in no particular order, here we go. Starting with,"
00:01:16,00:01:22,"okay you were told to put your name, this price is not for the name, it's an absolute disaster."
00:01:22,00:01:25,"Why don't we, I reckon people are going to remember what their facts were."
00:01:25,00:01:29,"That's true, Max Walker. Wicked, okay Max."
00:01:29,00:01:35,So my fact is about the Scrooge effect which is if you make somebody think about death
00:01:35,00:01:43,they then increase how charitable they are and also when they do donations they then get more
00:01:43,00:01:47,satisfaction from it as well. Oh wow. That's good. Okay.
00:01:47,00:01:52,Do we assume because they're thinking I really hope someone gives money to charity when I die
00:01:52,00:01:59,"so that it's not as bad? I think that's what people suspect, yeah. It also makes people spend more"
00:01:59,00:02:05,material goods in general. Okay. What is this famous effect called where you buy something green?
00:02:05,00:02:09,Oh you're so you're doing something really good for the environment and then because you've done that
00:02:09,00:02:13,then you do something really not very nice afterwards. It's called moral licensing. Okay.
00:02:13,00:02:17,So where you let yourself do something bad so this sounds a bit like the opposite of that I suppose.
00:02:17,00:02:20,You're reminded of something bad that's going to happen to you so you then do something good.
00:02:20,00:02:25,Yeah. What's moral licensing? What's a good example? If you don't have a shower to save water
00:02:25,00:02:29,later on you'll leave the hob on longer. Yeah.
00:02:29,00:02:37,Yeah. Or you'll fill up the kettle slightly less than normal so it uses less energy and then you'll
00:02:37,00:02:45,go out and brutally murder three people. Yeah. moral licensing. I weirdly today I read a story about
00:02:45,00:02:52,a show that has been named the worst show of all time. In which show? In which the prizes were all
00:02:52,00:02:57,charity prizes and the idea was that it was four celebrities and it was a show hosted by a
00:02:57,00:03:02,comedian back in the day called Jackie Gleason and the idea was that if the celebrity got the question
00:03:02,00:03:07,right a bunch of care packages would go to their choice of charity. If they got it wrong it would
00:03:07,00:03:12,go in Jackie Gleason's name so it looked like he was this amazing. It's like wow this Jackie Gleason
00:03:12,00:03:18,guy is incredible he cares so much. So here's the thing the show was terrible it was absolutely terrible
00:03:18,00:03:23,and it got cancelled after two shows but the second show and as far as I know it's the only time in
00:03:23,00:03:28,history this has happened the second show was Jackie Gleason sitting on a stripped-down set and it was
00:03:28,00:03:34,half an hour of him apologizing to the audience at home. The entire second show was him going we totally
00:03:34,00:03:38,messed up that was horrible we can't believe we did that to you we can't believe we spent so much
00:03:38,00:03:42,money on it and then they cancelled the show but it's known as the worst show of all time. Yeah that sounds
00:03:42,00:03:48,tedious. It's really interesting the stuff that has a psychological effect on you that you're not
00:03:48,00:03:52,realizing and they're always doing studies sometimes quite dubious about it but there's that study
00:03:52,00:03:56,that says that if there's pop music playing in a shop I think I'm all ready to spend more money
00:03:56,00:04:02,and also the fact that they start playing classical music in places that are high crime
00:04:02,00:04:06,haven't they? Because then it stops people it deters people from going to crime stations they do
00:04:06,00:04:11,that. To stations yeah and dodgy parts of town play classical music people. Okay should we go on to
00:04:11,00:04:17,the next fact? Yeah yeah go for it. Cool and so I think it's from someone called Coralie or Coralie
00:04:17,00:04:23,ah yes so if you could pass that over I'll also read a tweet at the same time yeah go for it
00:04:23,00:04:30,and so we have a tweet by someone called @olegranger and they said my fact is that if you like grilled
00:04:30,00:04:38,cheese you'll have 32% more sex. What was this um an experiment you did yourself for?
00:04:38,00:04:45,It was on BBC News. Oh was it amazing. And is that going to turn into a sexy food now when you
00:04:45,00:04:51,sort of like bringing a date home and going grilled cheese or champagne oysters and rare bit?
00:04:55,00:05:01,Okay let's move on to Coralie. Is it Coralie or Coralie? Coralie. Coralie what was your fact?
00:05:01,00:05:13,In 1567 the man with the longest feud um died. Trapped over it running away from a fire.
00:05:13,00:05:21,Okay when you trip it's quite easy to get back up straight away right? It depends where you trip.
00:05:21,00:05:29,It was a fire next to the Grand Canyon so I think this guy with the beard I think I've heard
00:05:29,00:05:33,about him and I think he used to tuck his beard in a pocket didn't he? He had a little pocket and
00:05:33,00:05:38,he used to tuck it in there so he didn't trip over and presumably this time the fire was on and he
00:05:38,00:05:45,sort of put his hands in the air not his beard out of his pocket and then trips up wow I'm speculating
00:05:47,00:05:52,and I accepted that as true anytime James tells me something you're like wow okay that's good that's
00:05:52,00:05:59,knowledge now. Abraham Lincoln had a beard famously yeah not for most of his life though did he?
00:05:59,00:06:04,The reason he grew a beard I don't know if people know about this is because a young girl wrote him a
00:06:04,00:06:09,letter saying that if he grew a beard then some of her brothers would vote for him um because he'd
00:06:09,00:06:15,made a speech or he'd made a statement in some way saying I think it's so like reminiscent of
00:06:15,00:06:19,kind of shortage trendy people today he said a thing saying do you think people might think I'm a
00:06:19,00:06:24,bit pretentious if I grow this beard now this whole whiskery thing and this girl wrote him saying look
00:06:24,00:06:28,I've got this brother he's saying he won't vote for you unless you have facial hair and so he did
00:06:28,00:06:33,it and then he met her a few years later a station didn't he and said this beard's for you wow
00:06:33,00:06:41,it was a different time wasn't it it was a more innocent time the 1860s
00:06:45,00:06:50,um I go I just to move on quickly there's a really good tweet here that I got from at Finneyland
00:06:50,00:06:56,which is that in 2009 two French mayors declared the same street one way but in different directions
00:06:56,00:07:06,that is such a fantastic moment in history I remember that happening actually
00:07:06,00:07:11,do you yeah was it in it's like near Paris or Paris yeah yeah yeah and it was like a big argument
00:07:11,00:07:16,between these two mugs and they just decided right we're going to do it my uncle used to be a mayor
00:07:16,00:07:23,in Bolton did he okay yeah what what what did he declare well he declared of his counterpart
00:07:23,00:07:28,he declared that this was actually when it was a council around in the mayor but
00:07:28,00:07:35,they wanted to build some houses in Bolton and the no one wanted them to build these houses and
00:07:35,00:07:38,they tried to stop them but they couldn't stop them because they had the law on their side
00:07:38,00:07:45,and my uncle thought well we can't stop them but what we can do is we can rename the streets
00:07:45,00:07:51,things that they don't want to put houses on and so they came up with the idea of making a diarrhea
00:07:51,00:07:58,drive and Hitler grows and they were genuinely they actually had plans that they were going to
00:07:58,00:08:03,make these streets but then in the end I think what someone backed out of yeah just on the the
00:08:03,00:08:11,subjects of of things being named Hitler there used to be a guy who lived in Ohio in he was living
00:08:11,00:08:16,around World War II his name was Adolf Hitler right and he was living in America in Ohio refused
00:08:16,00:08:21,to change his name and when the guy asked him why have you not changed your name he said I'm not going
00:08:21,00:08:32,to let one guy ruin the good name of Adolf Hitler and so he kept the name and I always for years
00:08:32,00:08:36,I've known this as a kind of QIish kind of thing and I've never kind of thought to think of whatever
00:08:36,00:08:42,happened to his dream did it work I looked into it Ohio in America is the only place now that has
00:08:42,00:08:46,Hitler named landmarks they've got a Hitler lake they've got a Hitler church they have a Hitler
00:08:46,00:08:51,park it worked it worked Hitler brought the name background wow because what was he was he like
00:08:51,00:08:56,give me two months I'll bring this back this will be a fine name again like Hitler did have
00:08:56,00:09:05,nephews in Liverpool didn't they yeah and one of them hit one of his nephews wrote an article in 1939
00:09:05,00:09:16,with the headline why I hate my uncle he's really bad presence at Christmas shall we move on
00:09:16,00:09:25,yeah let's move on to our dexfacts okay our next fact is from Otte no oh sorry no uh Diane
00:09:25,00:09:34,that they are similar to be fair do I do pond is that a name that yeah I think oh can you pass
00:09:34,00:09:39,the microphone over okay so while you pass that on I'll read one of these facts that we have from
00:09:40,00:09:49,at a patu and they said that canadian one dollar coins are called lunis and two dollar coins are called
00:09:49,00:09:57,tunis that's really cool good today I'll tell you something about Canada margarine was illegal in
00:09:57,00:10:04,Canada from around 1880 to around 1930 something like that what was the reason it was a very powerful
00:10:04,00:10:09,lobbying from the dairy manufacturers they wanted it to be banned because they thought that they
00:10:09,00:10:13,would bring taken away the butter business and they banned it and then they brought it back for a
00:10:13,00:10:18,little time dream first world war because they needed something yeah in the bread but yeah for a long
00:10:18,00:10:21,time and actually in some parts of America as well in Maine it was I think there were seven states
00:10:21,00:10:27,where my dream was illegal at the start the 20th century yeah Wisconsin yeah and people would
00:10:27,00:10:33,smuggle it over the border they had to die blue they had to die blue they had to die blue yeah
00:10:33,00:10:39,blue and pink why did they even come back to die packets so it's not to be confused with butter
00:10:39,00:10:45,oh wow so once again this is just an example of the type of audience that we have when we do a comedy
00:10:45,00:10:51,game most other gigs is just people going you suck get off we have corrections in a in a told off
00:10:51,00:10:55,sort of matter I wrote a tweet earlier and I got corrected on it in four different ways
00:10:55,00:11:02,within 10 minutes two mathematical one simple counting thing which I hadn't done and one scriptural
00:11:02,00:11:12,pretty good that's great does this lady Diane Stroke Otto Stroke have you got a mic yeah
00:11:12,00:11:18,I do cool what was your fact the date work for 58 is actually short for eight and half three 20s
00:11:18,00:11:27,58 is eight eight and half three 20s it follows like a Roman logical numerologic that's why it's
00:11:27,00:11:34,semi-similar but much more complicated to a French isn't it which does you know catch a van yeah whatever
00:11:34,00:11:39,this is much better but I need brackets to understand yeah I'm gonna put out there I literally don't
00:11:39,00:11:45,understand what that means I'm not even gonna attempt to try and comprehend it did anyone try that
00:11:45,00:11:50,maths quiz there was all over the news yesterday that logic quiz it was good wasn't it it was was
00:11:50,00:11:59,in Sweden no Singapore S countries confused we could do this whole thing in call and response like
00:11:59,00:12:06,like a queen gig so what was it it was a logic it was a logic puzzle it was where a girl and her two
00:12:06,00:12:10,friends were she was trying to make them guess when her birthday was and she told one friend a date
00:12:10,00:12:14,of her birthday and the other friend the month of her birthday and then there's a conversation
00:12:14,00:12:19,where I mean you look it up yeah I'm not gonna give it to you yeah do you want to hear a really lame logic
00:12:19,00:12:28,joke no it's tough it goes it's not mine three logicians walk into a bar and the farmer says do you
00:12:28,00:12:33,all want to drink and the first guy says I don't know the second guy says I don't know the third guy goes
00:12:33,00:12:42,yes I don't think it's that type of crowd James I'm gonna go for that kind of stuff tonight
00:12:42,00:12:53,yeah the logic material didn't quite work it's a good one okay I have another fact here and it
00:12:53,00:12:58,doesn't have a nail it has a name on the back from Josephine Josephine all right so while that's
00:12:58,00:13:05,making it over here's another fact we got from Twitter from @itimpilgram jelly babies were
00:13:05,00:13:17,originally marketed under the name unwanted babies okay Josephine have you got a microphone
00:13:17,00:13:25,yes what would you like to tell us um rhinoceros beetle it's towing capacity is the same as a man
00:13:25,00:13:32,lifting nine male elephants over his head how are they wow yeah are they doing it to show off or is
00:13:32,00:13:42,it like I because I I've I've not even lifted one elephant I could I just never felt the need
00:13:42,00:13:48,that's yeah I mean well the idea with this with with insects is actually it's because
00:13:48,00:13:54,if you're a lot smaller it's a lot easier to do stronger things and that's because your muscle
00:13:54,00:14:00,strength depends on the cross section of your muscle which is a two-dimensional thing and your
00:14:00,00:14:04,size a three-dimensional thing and so it goes up quicker because you're also playing it three times
00:14:04,00:14:08,rather than two times and I explain that very well no no that's good I've always felt inferior
00:14:08,00:14:13,to ants because of this kind of thing and that's it's not because of that kind of thing and they
00:14:13,00:14:29,work in a team there is one thing which is and it's I think the strongest organism in nature and
00:14:29,00:14:35,it's a lot it's even smaller than the rhinoceros beetle but it's gonorrhea gonorrhea can tow
00:14:35,00:14:42,something like a hundred thousand times its own weight which is um which is probably why it's so
00:14:42,00:14:48,successful we not from our perspective but it has these uh filaments all the all around it called
00:14:48,00:14:53,pilly which it sort of like it crawls along things with them and it has this huge huge pulling capacity
00:14:53,00:14:59,it's very good wouldn't Andy make the most fantastic STI doctor just as you're getting the news that
00:14:59,00:15:09,you got gonorrhea do you know which uh Dan which is your strongest muscle in your body um what would
00:15:09,00:15:18,you say my tongue oh muscle it's a reasonable guess but it's wrong and so the strongest absolutely
00:15:18,00:15:22,will be your ass your glutes is maximus and that's pretty much because it's the biggest got the biggest
00:15:22,00:15:30,cross section I don't know you but the biggest by um by actual like got by size but the biggest
00:15:30,00:15:36,by like square centimeter is not in your body but it is in Anna's body it's the uterus is really
00:15:36,00:15:45,strongest your uterus is actually very weak sounds like a challenge let's get your uterus out
00:15:45,00:15:54,let's do this every live show every live show he does this and a uterus has the strength equivalent
00:15:54,00:16:01,of a crossbow now I don't understand what that means I mean medieval castles when perceived
00:16:01,00:16:11,did not go to the uterus cabinet does that so is that saying if we like rigged up an arrow somehow
00:16:11,00:16:16,to our uterus then we could propel it further than a crossbow or not really a crossbow is much bigger
00:16:16,00:16:23,so it's like per square area that is a good fact just while we're talking about the body quickly
00:16:23,00:16:29,I've developed a new thing on oh dear Dan I have to tell you from the diseases perspective
00:16:29,00:16:39,it's doing great no it's just it's an odd new thing I've just in the last six months every time I
00:16:39,00:16:48,wake up I'm woken up by the sound of my own body from my face going every time I wake up now like I
00:16:48,00:16:56,swear to God every morning every morning I've woken up go what's happening to me that's my question
00:16:56,00:17:00,I don't know what's happening to you but have you considered donating to charity
00:17:00,00:17:08,swearing there was a man in America I don't know what made me think of this who was I think he was
00:17:08,00:17:14,executed and what happened was they thought that he'd had sex with a pig and the reason that they
00:17:14,00:17:19,thought they'd had said he'd had sex with a pig is because a pig had given birth to a piglet
00:17:19,00:17:20,that looks a bit like him
00:17:20,00:17:32,even though he knows it's not true that's the most insulting thing there's no winning that one so
00:17:32,00:17:39,ever that really reminds me of a story that I remember Richard Maidley of Richard and Judy telling
00:17:39,00:17:47,years ago he went up to a woman in a bus stop and he went bill high and this woman turned round
00:17:47,00:17:50,and then what are you talking about he said bill right he was like we knew each other at school and
00:17:50,00:17:54,she was like no I'm Jane and he said oh sorry you just look so much like bill I assumed you'd
00:17:54,00:18:01,had a sex change and it was you it was all a thing to do say what you're like about Richard Maidley he's
00:18:01,00:18:09,confident oh should we move on to our next facts okay this fact is from Chris R was at Nax Fish
00:18:09,00:18:14,do we have it do we have Chris uh hello in the meantime shall I show my baby the fact that I got
00:18:14,00:18:20,via email because I assume it's from someone who wasn't on Twitter Lauren Gilbert in 1958
00:18:20,00:18:26,Chris Jeff went to Beijing to meet with Mao Mao proceeded to suggest a meeting while swimming
00:18:26,00:18:31,knowing full well that Chris Jeff couldn't swim AIDS instantly appeared with water wings for Chris
00:18:31,00:18:35,Jeff and the meeting took place with Mao swimming up and down and Chris Jeff flailing around in his
00:18:35,00:18:48,arm bands okay who has the microphone hey hello hello go for it right um the police department in
00:18:48,00:18:53,Cambridge Massachusetts requested that when the Harvard Bridge between Cambridge and Boston
00:18:53,00:19:00,was refurbished in the 1980s that the graffiti on it was maintained by the people who created it
00:19:00,00:19:04,because it became beautifully and identifying where accidents were on the bridge so they would say
00:19:04,00:19:14,by the penis it's quite nerdy graffiti to be honest okay oh yeah okay my favorite fact about
00:19:14,00:19:23,graffiti oh graffiti is which is it James which is it this is about graffiti okay and it is that there
00:19:23,00:19:30,was a Christian group I think it was in the south of France I think and they were um cleared cleaning
00:19:30,00:19:35,up graffiti uh and they were doing it because they were very nice people and they started cleaning
00:19:35,00:19:39,and cleaning and cleaning and cleaning and then only afterwards did they found out they'd actually
00:19:39,00:19:47,cleaned off a lot of prehistoric cave paintings oh my god how did that I mean surely there's a
00:19:47,00:19:52,difference that you can tell between that is true although you know I think that a lot of prehistoric
00:19:52,00:19:57,cave paintings were done by teenage boys right actually and a lot of French graffiti is of buffaloes
00:19:57,00:20:04,being killed can I read out because we got sent in so we got an email when we said we need
00:20:04,00:20:08,facts for tonight and we got an email from a lady called Lauren Gilbert who we just had this fact
00:20:08,00:20:14,from Anna about Krushchev which is that so she gave us ten and this was my favorite one I'm going to
00:20:14,00:20:19,read it out exactly word for word what she's written F. Scott Fitzgerald bitched to Hemingway
00:20:19,00:20:26,that is Dick was too small then went to the bathroom and Hemingway looked at it and pronounced it
00:20:26,00:20:32,fine he had a terrible injury didn't he to his up I'm going of memory here Hemingway had a very bad
00:20:32,00:20:38,shrapnel wound possibly in the first world war which so which dealt severe damage to that region
00:20:38,00:20:45,like the top of his thighs and his parts and private parts and that there is a theory that that's
00:20:45,00:20:50,why he was so err about the big game hunting and the fishing and so when so when Fitzgerald showed him
00:20:50,00:20:55,it was sort of like half hanging off and bleeding a bit and he went looks absolutely normal to me
00:20:57,00:21:08,you're doing fine mate let's move on and Steve at Croyd where are you okay can someone give
00:21:08,00:21:16,the microphone to Steve there we are Steve what is your fact so the name Garrett is now as of 2013
00:21:16,00:21:22,less popular in the UK that's by people born within that year than both the name Thor and Loki
00:21:24,00:21:31,wow what that is incredible wow but Gary actually isn't like and it's isn't an old name is it the
00:21:31,00:21:36,first Gary was a country singer wasn't he someone's going to shout out who it was Gary Cooper
00:21:36,00:21:40,Gary Cooper yeah that's the very Cooper he was the first person pretty much I think called Gary and
00:21:40,00:21:45,I think he might have been named after a place called Gary in America okay and in the other you see
00:21:45,00:21:53,the world expert on Gary's isn't he what other name knowledge do you have then it's kind of
00:21:53,00:21:59,limited to basically that and I definitely learned from a different podcast you brought someone else's
00:21:59,00:22:08,fact from another podcast or so good do that all I thought it needs to raise the bar you know how many
00:22:08,00:22:17,people in North Croyd you think are called Kim Jong Un do you know the answer is correct yeah there's
00:22:17,00:22:24,only one person called Kim Jong Un because he made it all no he made the law that everyone else
00:22:24,00:22:29,who had that name had to change their name to something else to Gary to be fair I don't
00:22:29,00:22:35,reckon there are many Queen Elizabeth the seconds in Britain yeah I guess it would be Elizabeth
00:22:35,00:22:39,Windsor with all the Elizabeth Windsors would have to change their name does anyone here know anyone
00:22:39,00:22:44,called Elizabeth Windsor there we see nobody see nobody knows anyone called Elizabeth Windsor
00:22:44,00:22:49,and that is a scientific experiment happened right in front of your eyes I got sent a fact by someone
00:22:49,00:22:54,for tonight and it was a fantastic fact it was really good but I got so distracted by his name but I
00:22:54,00:23:01,forgot to write his fact down so I don't have his fact now but I do have his name and his name is
00:23:01,00:23:09,Andrew his surname go to bed as one word he's called Andrew go to bed and he goes by Andy and he has
00:23:09,00:23:14,a middle name which is William but he goes by Will so Andy will go to bed is his full name is that
00:23:14,00:23:19,great I found something about names the other day this is just completely random now but the first
00:23:19,00:23:26,English the first teacher of the English language in Japan was called Ronald McDonald
00:23:26,00:23:38,why did he move to Japan that's great okay another one let's keep going yeah let's pick another
00:23:38,00:23:45,effects and to us by Twitter this is from @83_biss when the tooth of a mastodon was found in North America
00:23:45,00:23:51,it was identified as the tooth of a giant now that's very exciting to me because if you've
00:23:51,00:23:57,listened to this podcast we talk I talk a lot about yeties and so on I worked out that's the period
00:23:57,00:24:02,I should have been born in when someone's finding a big thing and going well it's obviously the tooth
00:24:02,00:24:08,of a giant that's that's right there that's when I should have been born I would have been the man who
00:24:08,00:24:13,went what's clearly a giant and there we go mr. Schreiber you are well there was the other thing
00:24:13,00:24:18,the first dinosaur bone which they thought was a scrotum of a giant and they called it scrotum
00:24:18,00:24:25,humanum and it turned out to be a meglis I think but by the strict rules of nomenclature they should
00:24:25,00:24:29,still call it scrotum humanum because you're supposed to call it the first thing that you called it
00:24:29,00:24:35,are you yeah wow so meglis or I still call it a scrotum humanum actually but you as we've
00:24:35,00:24:43,ascertained call it graffito that is true um sharks teeth when they were just got fossilized
00:24:43,00:24:48,sharks teeth sharks obviously go really many many millions of years back and often their teeth are
00:24:48,00:24:52,the only bit of them which survives because they are all cartilage they don't have any bones so
00:24:52,00:24:57,we know we only really know about fossil fossil sharks or ancient sharks from their teeth but they
00:24:57,00:25:03,were thought to be a dragon's teeth unsurprisingly and they were crushed into powder and sold as a medicine
00:25:03,00:25:09,wow yeah and people still take bits of shark as medicine to this day but they shouldn't please
00:25:09,00:25:15,don't do it because it doesn't work just got a dead shark then and you're not any better
00:25:15,00:25:23,okay another one um esta Clark I really like the fact that people say alcohol is not a solution
00:25:23,00:25:33,but according to chemistry alcohol is a solution that's very good all right so you like the chemistry
00:25:33,00:25:40,jokes we don't like the logic jokes I hope you don't work at a DA said so that would be all right
00:25:40,00:25:46,alcohol is not the solution except of course that it is the solution okay okay something's dissolved
00:25:46,00:25:51,in something to make it alcohol yeah you could have pure alcohol but it's really hard to get
00:25:51,00:25:59,out of most about most alcohol is in water so alcoholic drinks are the solution yeah pure alcohol
00:25:59,00:26:03,is not pure alcohol's poisonous well that's very responsible so you're not advocating pure alcohol
00:26:03,00:26:11,no I think that's okay so I think if you put water and alcohol together like 40% is about the best
00:26:11,00:26:16,kind of solution for alcohol and water and the person you found that out was Mendelayev who did
00:26:16,00:26:21,the periodic table and I think he did it for his dissertation or something like that and he worked
00:26:21,00:26:26,that out so he was the first person to do it how did Mendelayev work out that 40% was the best he
00:26:26,00:26:31,was a chemist and he tried lots out and that's yeah so there's no there's notebooks increasingly
00:26:31,00:26:39,spidery and slurred towards the 55 to 45 that's okay if the joint ages that age used to have been in
00:26:39,00:26:42,I should have lived in the age where you could just drink loads of alcohol and claim you're a chemist
00:26:42,00:26:51,and this also reminds you of another brilliant fact that was sent in by email by Lauren I think
00:26:51,00:26:58,which was that the first ICBMs the ballistic missiles placed by the USSR outside of the USSR
00:26:58,00:27:02,which were placed in East Germany could never have been used because the soldiers in charge of them
00:27:02,00:27:09,drank the rocket fuel because it was made of alcohol oh no that's like with the when
00:27:10,00:27:17,it was they sent up a bit of bark from the tree that Newton was apparently sitting under when he
00:27:17,00:27:22,had the apple and he realized the idea of gravity they sent that up into space with an apple and the
00:27:22,00:27:25,idea was that they were going to drop the apple and they were going to drop the bit of bark together
00:27:25,00:27:30,so that they could experience a lack of gravity so it was a very exciting moment but they forgot
00:27:30,00:27:34,to tell some of the astronauts why the apple was up there and so they ate it and then they were like
00:27:34,00:27:40,okay so I'm to do the experiments and they were going what experiment so they ended up doing the
00:27:40,00:27:46,experiment with a bit of bark and a pair that they had no one likes pairs of the international
00:27:46,00:27:54,should we move on to another fact? Yes and then you've got one I think. Yes I have this is from Adam
00:27:54,00:27:59,hey Adam. Okay so I'll pass the mic over and while we're doing that I got a a tweet from someone
00:27:59,00:28:06,called Olivia Annie at Olivia Annie and she sent me this fact that Bucharest and Budapest are the
00:28:06,00:28:14,fifth most mixed up places in the world and she didn't say what the first fall were okay. Surely
00:28:14,00:28:18,Slovenia is the back here. Yeah you're going to see. I don't know what the other was up but so I
00:28:18,00:28:26,googled it and I found there was sites called Bucharest not Budapest.com which collects all the
00:28:26,00:28:32,"different times when people have mixed it up and Iron Maiden, Moor Chiba, Metallica, and Lenny Kravitz"
00:28:32,00:28:39,have all mistaken Bucharest for Budapest on stage. Cool okay where's the microphone?
00:28:39,00:28:46,The wages in Chelsea and Fulham are so high that it's the only constituency in the UK where the
00:28:46,00:28:54,average wage is higher than the wage of their MP. Wow. So their MP is like the working man.
00:28:55,00:29:01,I know something about I think it's the constituency of Kensington which is nearby it's not not a
00:29:01,00:29:10,million miles away and it has the highest proportion of miners as in MIN ERS in any constituency
00:29:10,00:29:22,in the country and it's because it's a lot of people who own mines basically they say occupation
00:29:22,00:29:30,mining. Okay let's move on let's try to get some more in before we finish so Chris who worries Chris.
00:29:30,00:29:37,Okay so Apollo 13 nearly ended in disaster before it even got to space because of a malfunction
00:29:37,00:29:41,that happened but a second malfunction occurred that saved the ship from being destroyed.
00:29:41,00:29:47,What did it fix the first malfunction? Yeah pretty much. What? That's very rare.
00:29:51,00:29:57,Good thing we have an asteroid physicist on the panel today. That's why I should have been born
00:29:57,00:30:06,the age of space. That's incredible. That's amazing so okay so because there's a Apollo 13 my
00:30:06,00:30:11,favorite movie of all time there it genuinely is. Was it a real thing that happened as well as the
00:30:11,00:30:17,movie? Yeah yeah yeah yeah. Is it it's not your favorite event of all time is it? It kind of is
00:30:17,00:30:23,actually no because it's to me Apollo 13 is the greatest story ever told you have a tin heading
00:30:23,00:30:28,out into deep space. An explosion happens they're told they have something like an hour left of
00:30:28,00:30:33,oxygen and they're going to die and everyone on the earth and three men and a tin can have to solve
00:30:33,00:30:38,it and the only way that they can get back home is to go that way towards the moon. It's insane
00:30:38,00:30:44,that is and they made it home with spoiler alert they made it home alive and that is incredible
00:30:44,00:30:48,and then obviously there's a big line in the movie where as they're going up there is a malfunction
00:30:48,00:30:53,and they say there was a glitch what was the line it was something like uh yeah so they say we just
00:30:53,00:30:56,had our glitch for this mission. We just had our glitch for this mission not knowing that there
00:30:56,00:31:02,was going to be this explosion. Obviously why would they have known? But so but this is an
00:31:02,00:31:07,interesting fact as well about about glitches and things going wrong when you go into space.
00:31:07,00:31:11,There was a book called Moon Dust and in it someone from NASA was saying that on a good successful
00:31:11,00:31:19,space flight 99.99 percent of things work which means a typical ship is six million parts that means
00:31:19,00:31:24,"on a good flight they expect 6,000 things to break as they're going up. Did you just do that in your"
00:31:24,00:31:32,"head right then? No. I was trying to style that out and my mouth didn't let me. 6,000. Yeah that's"
00:31:32,00:31:37,"incredible. 6,000 things. Can you imagine any other job on the first time you use something?"
00:31:37,00:31:42,"If I had 6,000 things break if I was running it I would take 6,000 very tiny very breakable glass"
00:31:42,00:31:48,plates. I'd smash all of them as we set off and then presumably everything else would work.
00:31:48,00:31:58,Then then you understand probability at all. Just another fact about things going wrong in space.
00:31:58,00:32:04,My wife told me this today in fact and that is that the two biggest disasters in
00:32:05,00:32:11,rockets in Russian history both happened on the 24th of October on different years but they
00:32:11,00:32:16,happened on the same day and so to this day in all the rocket fields and stuff in Russia they
00:32:16,00:32:20,always turn all the electricity off and close everything down on that day just so it doesn't happen
00:32:20,00:32:29,again. Really? Wow. There are lots of Russian cosmonauts and astronaut superstitions so lots of
00:32:29,00:32:35,things have built up over the gears at the Russian space rocket. So I think on the final drive
00:32:35,00:32:40,"to the what is it the lift off point to the to the rocket ship? To the rocket ship, thank you."
00:32:40,00:32:46,On the final drive the astronauts will get out they'll stop the car they'll get out and they'll
00:32:46,00:32:53,have a wee against the right back wheel I think it is of the truck or the car. And that's a good
00:32:53,00:32:57,guarantee that the first time you're a good guy I did it the first time. What if you get performance
00:32:57,00:33:02,anxiety and you can't go? I presume that we need a launch. I'm trying! I'm trying!
00:33:03,00:33:09,F's got Fitzgeralds going what the fuck is that? I mean we like to be!
00:33:09,00:33:19,Okay should we keep going? Yeah let's see. Well this one is from Sophie S.
00:33:19,00:33:24,Where are you Sophie S? I'll write in the corners so let's find another fact while we're doing that.
00:33:24,00:33:32,Okay so here is the fact from @the_imageSmith and that is if you wanted to recreate the entire
00:33:32,00:33:39,"Lego movie with actual Lego you would need 15 million 80,330 Lego pieces."
00:33:39,00:33:47,I mean yeah but why would you want to do that? We've got the Lego movie and it's the best
00:33:47,00:33:56,thing it's ever been done. Yeah exactly. Have we got the microphone? So my fact is when a dog enters
00:33:56,00:34:05,the room it knows what happened two hours before. What are you talking about? Did you learn this
00:34:05,00:34:11,fact from me because I don't think. So you know what food was on the floor and who was on
00:34:11,00:34:18,in the room before? Is it through smell or through smell? Oh it's through smell but I can't tell anyone
00:34:18,00:34:32,that's so nuts. What are you saying buddy? I think he's hungry. Oh no but of course what a curse.
00:34:32,00:34:39,The idea is that once we got dogs our brain shrunk isn't it? Oh yeah. And that is because when we were
00:34:39,00:34:44,hunting we needed to be really good at picking up scents and really good at hearing things etc etc.
00:34:44,00:34:49,And so then we got dogs and domesticated them and then we didn't need to smell those things anymore
00:34:49,00:34:52,so that smell bit of our brain shrunk and then we didn't need to hear things and so they're hearing
00:34:52,00:34:57,bit of our brain shrunk and it's been shown that humans that were around before dogs were domesticated
00:34:57,00:35:06,did have bigger brains. Yeah. Wow that was just a fact. So there is a thing about anteaters which is
00:35:06,00:35:13,that when anteaters eat ants they don't digest the ants that they eat. The ants digest themselves.
00:35:14,00:35:19,Because the anteaters they don't have the proper acid in their stomach but ants obviously
00:35:19,00:35:26,have lots of formic acid inside them so they just digest themselves. Wait so they do that as a kind of
00:35:26,00:35:33,like Harry carry kind of thing? When they die they be eaten. They start to produce this form of
00:35:33,00:35:38,acid and that then mulches the whole load of ants down. So anteaters have now again got rid of that
00:35:38,00:35:43,unnecessary bit of their digestive system which they don't need anymore. That is actually a bit like
00:35:43,00:35:47,and I actually I think someone also wrote this fact down today that baby pandas can't digest
00:35:47,00:35:54,eucalyptus can they but it's koala sorry sorry. Baby pandas. Who's fat was that? Come up here quickly
00:35:54,00:35:59,and say it was a baby koala is kind of just eucalyptus when they're first born so they have to get
00:35:59,00:36:04,the bacteria from their mother's kind of poo to be able to digest eucalyptus. I don't reckon humans
00:36:04,00:36:09,would be able to digest stuff without the bacteria in their stomachs and you get the bacteria from
00:36:09,00:36:15,your mother through their breast milk. So like a baby probably wouldn't be able to digest you know
00:36:15,00:36:21,Ben and Jerry's ice cream are. Damn it. It's not whether that's the most indigestible thing I could
00:36:21,00:36:27,think of. Yeah yeah yeah. Do you think what's the thing that's least like baby food in the world?
00:36:27,00:36:36,Colder milk. You've got to say steak or salmon on crude. We actually put out on Twitter. We said
00:36:36,00:36:42,you could win two tickets tonight if you come up with the fact which is who was that? Was that you?
00:36:42,00:36:47,Can you just yell out your fact because it's about Ben and Jerry's isn't it? Ben and Jerry's milk
00:36:47,00:36:52,comes from massaged cows. What? So and I read into it basically Ben and Jerry's they have a big
00:36:52,00:36:56,farm and they really look after their cows including before they milk them they're just like how are
00:36:56,00:37:09,you today sir? Oh man I guess. That's not milk. That's why I was kicked out of the bullwrecks.
00:37:09,00:37:17,Who's got the microphone? We had another fact coming out then we? Oh no we don't let's
00:37:17,00:37:25,go. Okay Anna. I think it's another Anna. There's another other at the front. Okay let's find another
00:37:25,00:37:34,fact from our Twitter list. Okay so I got one here. At Timothy underscore Johnson the motto of the
00:37:34,00:37:43,Salvation Army is blood and fire. They were very unpopular for a while. People really didn't like
00:37:43,00:37:49,a Salvation Army. Maybe that was the branding issue. No they were they're a Christian organisation
00:37:49,00:37:54,and I think it was William Booth who set up the Salvation Army and he was known as the General. He
00:37:54,00:37:59,was an incredibly organised and strict man and there was another army which was set up in opposition
00:37:59,00:38:06,to the Salvation Army called I think the Skeleton Army and they made it their business to disrupt
00:38:06,00:38:10,the Salvation Army in all their good works and they were bastards they were yeah they're really
00:38:10,00:38:14,unpleasant people and they threw rocks at them and they threw you know burning stuff at the Salvation
00:38:14,00:38:20,and whenever they turned up trying to help. Yeah wow not not funny but you know but was there also flowers
00:38:20,00:38:30,and candy? I know what was your fight? Actually Tom says better. Well how one you tell us both and
00:38:30,00:38:37,we'll decide which is the better fact. Okay so since 1945 our British tanks must come equipped
00:38:37,00:38:47,with team-making supplies. That's how I imagine you exist in life Andy you you're in a tank
00:38:47,00:38:52,and there's tea in there. That's that's a bad week milk you tea by the way of its Andy but
00:38:52,00:38:56,I mean that's an office. This is off this stuff. This is why I say you can't work in a team.
00:38:56,00:39:04,You're constantly throwing shade on my team. The worst thing is the milk came from Dan.
00:39:04,00:39:19,So we let's hear the second fact. Okay no also I've read that all that is it JCBs are so popular
00:39:19,00:39:22,as digging machines because they all have cattle's inside and that was the main feature.
00:39:22,00:39:26,Wasn't that they dug better? Wasn't they could carry more stuff? They just have a cattle on board
00:39:26,00:39:33,so you can make a cup of tea. Yeah I see. So what's the rival facts? Yeah. I didn't know it was a rival
00:39:33,00:39:43,effects. It is how? Okay so Joseph Stalin had some Russian scientists attempt to create an
00:39:43,00:39:48,ape human hybrid because he thought it would be useful in Russian industry and we'll be able to
00:39:48,00:39:59,battle with stun pain. And how are you getting on them? Whoa I call a foul. How far down the
00:39:59,00:40:05,process did he get? I don't know. They enjoyed the dinner but the bedroom was a complete disaster.
00:40:05,00:40:16,But it was ultimately a failure. No. I mean he had the scientist who was leading the project
00:40:16,00:40:23,exiled to Kazakhstan for failing. Wow that's tough because he probably didn't want that project
00:40:23,00:40:29,in the first place. There was a there was a prediction. You know these cool old predictions they have
00:40:29,00:40:33,of how life is going to be in the 21st century from a hundred years ago and they're always either
00:40:33,00:40:38,spookly right or ridiculous. And one of them said that we won't have to drive our cars anymore.
00:40:38,00:40:42,This is from I think the 20s from going off memory. We won't have to drive our cars anymore because
00:40:42,00:40:49,we will have a race of hyper intelligent monkey butler creatures which will do the driving for us.
00:40:49,00:40:52,That's the only thing we'll have told them to do. Well this ties in nicely with the twitter
00:40:52,00:40:58,fact that we got sent by a guy called you and Taylor which is sorry this is Facebook. In 1953
00:40:58,00:41:03,NASCAR driver Tim Flock raced for eight races with a racist monkey named Jocco Flocko
00:41:03,00:41:12,as his co-driver. So maybe he was trying to start the revolution there or the evolution I don't know
00:41:12,00:41:17,whatever. Let's do one more and we should wrap up as well. Why don't you choose Anna?
00:41:17,00:41:20,Yeah Anna go for it. Yeah sorry I think I forgot about the whole fact choosing thing.
00:41:22,00:41:28,"Okay. It's from Steve. Steve, yeah. What about particle accelerators? Yes. This is the kind of"
00:41:28,00:41:33,crowd in which we could have two Steve's who both brought a fact about that. All right true.
00:41:33,00:41:40,Okay let's read something out. I've got one. This is from at T.B. UK 2 to back 2.
00:41:40,00:41:47,It's a twitter name. You may have already done this one. A consultant urologist at Musgrove Park
00:41:47,00:41:57,"Hospital in Taunton, Somerset is named Nicholas Burns Cox. He's my friend's dad. No. Really?"
00:41:57,00:42:04,Hello. Did you send us that fact? No. Oh my god. It's cool. Very cool.
00:42:04,00:42:10,"From Taunton. He's really nice. Wow. My mum's done the Taunton veil. Yeah, it's nice place."
00:42:10,00:42:16,Can I just say we're focusing on the wrong bit of the fact.
00:42:16,00:42:29,"Talk to his nice, isn't it? Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Bridgewater said more of that."
00:42:29,00:42:35,"Oh no. Are urologist granddaughter or daughter owns Napoleon's penis now, doesn't she?"
00:42:35,00:42:40,"What? I think yes, you're right. Yes, there's been bought and re-bought over the years and"
00:42:40,00:42:44,disappeared and then it was left with a urologist who died and he left it in his wilderness daughter.
00:42:44,00:42:49,"Yeah, there's a lot, so there's a lot of famous historical male penises that have been passed"
00:42:49,00:42:53,"down through families, sold in orchid. Just male penises. Yeah, just the male ones."
00:42:53,00:42:59,An email uterus is there. Napoleon's was described at auction as a mummified
00:42:59,00:43:04,"tendon, which is quite a delicate way of putting it. But it was an inch long. But it was described"
00:43:04,00:43:15,"by Scott Fitzgerald. There's a very, very good size. Okay, okay, last fight. Final fact is from Steve."
00:43:15,00:43:22,"So the only man to ever stick his head in the path of particle accelerator, not only lived to"
00:43:22,00:43:30,"complete his PhD, but also seems sort of not aged since the accident. What? Wait, was the accident"
00:43:30,00:43:38,this week? It was in 1978. What? Anatoly Bikorski was a researcher at
00:43:38,00:43:44,something that I can't remember the name of because I'm an abacement and my notes have vanished
00:43:44,00:43:49,"up there with the Wi-Fi. Yeah, I think how we feel. Yeah, basically he was a researcher at an"
00:43:49,00:43:57,institute trying to complete his PhD and it was time to fix the particle accelerator. He stuck his head
00:43:57,00:44:04,"in it. Yeah, and the safety was apparently not working as well as it should have. And all of a sudden"
00:44:04,00:44:10,"the particle accelerator fired and a beam passed through his head. And he, according to John"
00:44:10,00:44:16,"words, he didn't feel any pain, but he did see a light brighter than a thousand suns. Yeah, wow."
00:44:16,00:44:24,And the left side of his face is pretty much no wrinkles. Is he begging to shove the other side
00:44:24,00:44:29,"of his head into there? No, he's not. He's actually been interested for Western"
00:44:29,00:44:34,"scientists to come over and say, hang out with him and say, ""What's going on in my brain?"""
00:44:34,00:44:40,But he kind of thought it. Wow. I think this is crying out for a kickstart. We'll go.
00:44:40,00:44:45,"Spacey, dyno man, and the logician."
00:44:45,00:44:53,"All right, well, let's wrap up the show and visit him. Thank you so much, guys, for coming to"
00:44:53,00:44:58,"this experiment tonight. We know it was going to be chaotic, but actually, I'm just putting this"
00:44:58,00:45:03,out there as someone who edits stuff. That's going to edit down really awesomely. It'll be a great
00:45:03,00:45:10,three minutes look. But thank you so much for coming. I'm going to do the ending of the show. That's
00:45:10,00:45:15,it. That's all of your facts. If you want to reach any of the people who said their facts during
00:45:15,00:45:20,"the show, you're all probably on Twitter on Facebook. Hunt them down and question their sources."
00:45:20,00:45:24,"We can be got on our regular Twitter handles. I'm on our tribal land, Andy."
