1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
 The following show you're about to listen to is slightly different to the ones we normally do.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:11,040
 This show was a live one recorded at the Aces and Aids bar in Tofno Park a couple of months ago

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,920
 and rather than being our four favourite facts, it was the favourite facts of the audience.

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,000
 So we did no prep for this at all, it was the first time we'd heard a lot of these facts

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,880
 so it's a bit ropey around the edges but stick with it because we think it's a really funny one

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,040
 and I hope you will enjoy it. We'll put it out this week in preparation for our

7
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,320
 Edinburgh Festival shows which begin next week.

8
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:57,760
 Hello and welcome to another episode and no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast this week

9
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,760
 coming to you live from the Aces and Aids bar in Tofno Park. My name is Dan Schreiber.

10
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,640
 I am sitting here with Anich Zinsky, James Harkin and Andy Murray and once again we've gathered

11
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,640
 around the microphone but this time it's not with our four favourite facts from the last seven days.

12
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:16,480
 It's your favourite facts and in no particular order, here we go. Starting with,

13
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:22,560
 okay you were told to put your name, this price is not for the name, it's an absolute disaster.

14
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,040
 Why don't we, I reckon people are going to remember what their facts were.

15
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,040
 That's true, Max Walker. Wicked, okay Max.

16
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:35,120
 So my fact is about the Scrooge effect which is if you make somebody think about death

17
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:43,040
 they then increase how charitable they are and also when they do donations they then get more

18
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,600
 satisfaction from it as well. Oh wow. That's good. Okay.

19
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,240
 Do we assume because they're thinking I really hope someone gives money to charity when I die

20
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:59,520
 so that it's not as bad? I think that's what people suspect, yeah. It also makes people spend more

21
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,600
 material goods in general. Okay. What is this famous effect called where you buy something green?

22
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,440
 Oh you're so you're doing something really good for the environment and then because you've done that

23
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,840
 then you do something really not very nice afterwards. It's called moral licensing. Okay.

24
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,600
 So where you let yourself do something bad so this sounds a bit like the opposite of that I suppose.

25
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,560
 You're reminded of something bad that's going to happen to you so you then do something good.

26
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,680
 Yeah. What's moral licensing? What's a good example? If you don't have a shower to save water

27
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,440
 later on you'll leave the hob on longer. Yeah.

28
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:37,440
 Yeah. Or you'll fill up the kettle slightly less than normal so it uses less energy and then you'll

29
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:45,440
 go out and brutally murder three people. Yeah. moral licensing. I weirdly today I read a story about

30
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:52,720
 a show that has been named the worst show of all time. In which show? In which the prizes were all

31
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,440
 charity prizes and the idea was that it was four celebrities and it was a show hosted by a

32
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,240
 comedian back in the day called Jackie Gleason and the idea was that if the celebrity got the question

33
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:07,360
 right a bunch of care packages would go to their choice of charity. If they got it wrong it would

34
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,800
 go in Jackie Gleason's name so it looked like he was this amazing. It's like wow this Jackie Gleason

35
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,880
 guy is incredible he cares so much. So here's the thing the show was terrible it was absolutely terrible

36
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,280
 and it got cancelled after two shows but the second show and as far as I know it's the only time in

37
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,000
 history this has happened the second show was Jackie Gleason sitting on a stripped-down set and it was

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,720
 half an hour of him apologizing to the audience at home. The entire second show was him going we totally

39
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,640
 messed up that was horrible we can't believe we did that to you we can't believe we spent so much

40
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,960
 money on it and then they cancelled the show but it's known as the worst show of all time. Yeah that sounds

41
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:48,240
 tedious. It's really interesting the stuff that has a psychological effect on you that you're not

42
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,720
 realizing and they're always doing studies sometimes quite dubious about it but there's that study

43
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,880
 that says that if there's pop music playing in a shop I think I'm all ready to spend more money

44
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:02,240
 and also the fact that they start playing classical music in places that are high crime

45
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,640
 haven't they? Because then it stops people it deters people from going to crime stations they do

46
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,600
 that. To stations yeah and dodgy parts of town play classical music people. Okay should we go on to

47
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:17,120
 the next fact? Yeah yeah go for it. Cool and so I think it's from someone called Coralie or Coralie

48
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:23,520
 ah yes so if you could pass that over I'll also read a tweet at the same time yeah go for it

49
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:30,240
 and so we have a tweet by someone called @olegranger and they said my fact is that if you like grilled

50
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:38,320
 cheese you'll have 32% more sex. What was this um an experiment you did yourself for?

51
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:45,280
 It was on BBC News. Oh was it amazing. And is that going to turn into a sexy food now when you

52
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:51,040
 sort of like bringing a date home and going grilled cheese or champagne oysters and rare bit?

53
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:01,440
 Okay let's move on to Coralie. Is it Coralie or Coralie? Coralie. Coralie what was your fact?

54
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:13,600
 In 1567 the man with the longest feud um died. Trapped over it running away from a fire.

55
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:21,760
 Okay when you trip it's quite easy to get back up straight away right? It depends where you trip.

56
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:29,280
 It was a fire next to the Grand Canyon so I think this guy with the beard I think I've heard

57
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,280
 about him and I think he used to tuck his beard in a pocket didn't he? He had a little pocket and

58
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,320
 he used to tuck it in there so he didn't trip over and presumably this time the fire was on and he

59
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:45,120
 sort of put his hands in the air not his beard out of his pocket and then trips up wow I'm speculating

60
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,960
 and I accepted that as true anytime James tells me something you're like wow okay that's good that's

61
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:59,520
 knowledge now. Abraham Lincoln had a beard famously yeah not for most of his life though did he?

62
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,560
 The reason he grew a beard I don't know if people know about this is because a young girl wrote him a

63
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,760
 letter saying that if he grew a beard then some of her brothers would vote for him um because he'd

64
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:15,360
 made a speech or he'd made a statement in some way saying I think it's so like reminiscent of

65
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,920
 kind of shortage trendy people today he said a thing saying do you think people might think I'm a

66
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:24,320
 bit pretentious if I grow this beard now this whole whiskery thing and this girl wrote him saying look

67
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,640
 I've got this brother he's saying he won't vote for you unless you have facial hair and so he did

68
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,600
 it and then he met her a few years later a station didn't he and said this beard's for you wow

69
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:41,120
 it was a different time wasn't it it was a more innocent time the 1860s

70
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,160
 um I go I just to move on quickly there's a really good tweet here that I got from at Finneyland

71
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:56,880
 which is that in 2009 two French mayors declared the same street one way but in different directions

72
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:06,160
 that is such a fantastic moment in history I remember that happening actually

73
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,280
 do you yeah was it in it's like near Paris or Paris yeah yeah yeah and it was like a big argument

74
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,560
 between these two mugs and they just decided right we're going to do it my uncle used to be a mayor

75
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:23,600
 in Bolton did he okay yeah what what what did he declare well he declared of his counterpart

76
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:28,400
 he declared that this was actually when it was a council around in the mayor but

77
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:35,520
 they wanted to build some houses in Bolton and the no one wanted them to build these houses and

78
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,640
 they tried to stop them but they couldn't stop them because they had the law on their side

79
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:45,200
 and my uncle thought well we can't stop them but what we can do is we can rename the streets

80
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:51,200
 things that they don't want to put houses on and so they came up with the idea of making a diarrhea

81
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:58,560
 drive and Hitler grows and they were genuinely they actually had plans that they were going to

82
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,760
 make these streets but then in the end I think what someone backed out of yeah just on the the

83
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:11,360
 subjects of of things being named Hitler there used to be a guy who lived in Ohio in he was living

84
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,400
 around World War II his name was Adolf Hitler right and he was living in America in Ohio refused

85
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,680
 to change his name and when the guy asked him why have you not changed your name he said I'm not going

86
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:32,000
 to let one guy ruin the good name of Adolf Hitler and so he kept the name and I always for years

87
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,320
 I've known this as a kind of QIish kind of thing and I've never kind of thought to think of whatever

88
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:42,080
 happened to his dream did it work I looked into it Ohio in America is the only place now that has

89
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,560
 Hitler named landmarks they've got a Hitler lake they've got a Hitler church they have a Hitler

90
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,760
 park it worked it worked Hitler brought the name background wow because what was he was he like

91
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,640
 give me two months I'll bring this back this will be a fine name again like Hitler did have

92
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:05,440
 nephews in Liverpool didn't they yeah and one of them hit one of his nephews wrote an article in 1939

93
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:16,320
 with the headline why I hate my uncle he's really bad presence at Christmas shall we move on

94
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:25,280
 yeah let's move on to our dexfacts okay our next fact is from Otte no oh sorry no uh Diane

95
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:34,080
 that they are similar to be fair do I do pond is that a name that yeah I think oh can you pass

96
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,440
 the microphone over okay so while you pass that on I'll read one of these facts that we have from

97
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:49,440
 at a patu and they said that canadian one dollar coins are called lunis and two dollar coins are called

98
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:57,200
 tunis that's really cool good today I'll tell you something about Canada margarine was illegal in

99
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:04,960
 Canada from around 1880 to around 1930 something like that what was the reason it was a very powerful

100
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:09,520
 lobbying from the dairy manufacturers they wanted it to be banned because they thought that they

101
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,200
 would bring taken away the butter business and they banned it and then they brought it back for a

102
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,160
 little time dream first world war because they needed something yeah in the bread but yeah for a long

103
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,520
 time and actually in some parts of America as well in Maine it was I think there were seven states

104
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:27,680
 where my dream was illegal at the start the 20th century yeah Wisconsin yeah and people would

105
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:33,120
 smuggle it over the border they had to die blue they had to die blue they had to die blue yeah

106
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:39,360
 blue and pink why did they even come back to die packets so it's not to be confused with butter

107
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:45,360
 oh wow so once again this is just an example of the type of audience that we have when we do a comedy

108
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:51,920
 game most other gigs is just people going you suck get off we have corrections in a in a told off

109
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,920
 sort of matter I wrote a tweet earlier and I got corrected on it in four different ways

110
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:02,480
 within 10 minutes two mathematical one simple counting thing which I hadn't done and one scriptural

111
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:12,160
 pretty good that's great does this lady Diane Stroke Otto Stroke have you got a mic yeah

112
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:18,880
 I do cool what was your fact the date work for 58 is actually short for eight and half three 20s

113
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:27,440
 58 is eight eight and half three 20s it follows like a Roman logical numerologic that's why it's

114
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:34,320
 semi-similar but much more complicated to a French isn't it which does you know catch a van yeah whatever

115
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,120
 this is much better but I need brackets to understand yeah I'm gonna put out there I literally don't

116
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:45,760
 understand what that means I'm not even gonna attempt to try and comprehend it did anyone try that

117
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,640
 maths quiz there was all over the news yesterday that logic quiz it was good wasn't it it was was

118
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:59,360
 in Sweden no Singapore S countries confused we could do this whole thing in call and response like

119
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:06,400
 like a queen gig so what was it it was a logic it was a logic puzzle it was where a girl and her two

120
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,880
 friends were she was trying to make them guess when her birthday was and she told one friend a date

121
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,880
 of her birthday and the other friend the month of her birthday and then there's a conversation

122
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,120
 where I mean you look it up yeah I'm not gonna give it to you yeah do you want to hear a really lame logic

123
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:28,320
 joke no it's tough it goes it's not mine three logicians walk into a bar and the farmer says do you

124
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,760
 all want to drink and the first guy says I don't know the second guy says I don't know the third guy goes

125
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:42,800
 yes I don't think it's that type of crowd James I'm gonna go for that kind of stuff tonight

126
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:53,520
 yeah the logic material didn't quite work it's a good one okay I have another fact here and it

127
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:58,400
 doesn't have a nail it has a name on the back from Josephine Josephine all right so while that's

128
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:05,040
 making it over here's another fact we got from Twitter from @itimpilgram jelly babies were

129
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:17,840
 originally marketed under the name unwanted babies okay Josephine have you got a microphone

130
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:25,920
 yes what would you like to tell us um rhinoceros beetle it's towing capacity is the same as a man

131
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:32,960
 lifting nine male elephants over his head how are they wow yeah are they doing it to show off or is

132
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:42,880
 it like I because I I've I've not even lifted one elephant I could I just never felt the need

133
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:48,640
 that's yeah I mean well the idea with this with with insects is actually it's because

134
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:54,640
 if you're a lot smaller it's a lot easier to do stronger things and that's because your muscle

135
00:13:54,640 --> 00:14:00,080
 strength depends on the cross section of your muscle which is a two-dimensional thing and your

136
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:04,000
 size a three-dimensional thing and so it goes up quicker because you're also playing it three times

137
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,160
 rather than two times and I explain that very well no no that's good I've always felt inferior

138
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,760
 to ants because of this kind of thing and that's it's not because of that kind of thing and they

139
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:29,200
 work in a team there is one thing which is and it's I think the strongest organism in nature and

140
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:35,200
 it's a lot it's even smaller than the rhinoceros beetle but it's gonorrhea gonorrhea can tow

141
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:42,080
 something like a hundred thousand times its own weight which is um which is probably why it's so

142
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:48,320
 successful we not from our perspective but it has these uh filaments all the all around it called

143
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,680
 pilly which it sort of like it crawls along things with them and it has this huge huge pulling capacity

144
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:59,200
 it's very good wouldn't Andy make the most fantastic STI doctor just as you're getting the news that

145
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:09,600
 you got gonorrhea do you know which uh Dan which is your strongest muscle in your body um what would

146
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:18,800
 you say my tongue oh muscle it's a reasonable guess but it's wrong and so the strongest absolutely

147
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,640
 will be your ass your glutes is maximus and that's pretty much because it's the biggest got the biggest

148
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:30,560
 cross section I don't know you but the biggest by um by actual like got by size but the biggest

149
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:36,960
 by like square centimeter is not in your body but it is in Anna's body it's the uterus is really

150
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:45,200
 strongest your uterus is actually very weak sounds like a challenge let's get your uterus out

151
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:54,800
 let's do this every live show every live show he does this and a uterus has the strength equivalent

152
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:01,120
 of a crossbow now I don't understand what that means I mean medieval castles when perceived

153
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:11,200
 did not go to the uterus cabinet does that so is that saying if we like rigged up an arrow somehow

154
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:16,320
 to our uterus then we could propel it further than a crossbow or not really a crossbow is much bigger

155
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:23,280
 so it's like per square area that is a good fact just while we're talking about the body quickly

156
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:29,440
 I've developed a new thing on oh dear Dan I have to tell you from the diseases perspective

157
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:39,840
 it's doing great no it's just it's an odd new thing I've just in the last six months every time I

158
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:48,640
 wake up I'm woken up by the sound of my own body from my face going every time I wake up now like I

159
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:56,080
 swear to God every morning every morning I've woken up go what's happening to me that's my question

160
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:00,160
 I don't know what's happening to you but have you considered donating to charity

161
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:08,480
 swearing there was a man in America I don't know what made me think of this who was I think he was

162
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:14,720
 executed and what happened was they thought that he'd had sex with a pig and the reason that they

163
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,040
 thought they'd had said he'd had sex with a pig is because a pig had given birth to a piglet

164
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,240
 that looks a bit like him

165
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:32,480
 even though he knows it's not true that's the most insulting thing there's no winning that one so

166
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:39,280
 ever that really reminds me of a story that I remember Richard Maidley of Richard and Judy telling

167
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:47,200
 years ago he went up to a woman in a bus stop and he went bill high and this woman turned round

168
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,960
 and then what are you talking about he said bill right he was like we knew each other at school and

169
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,320
 she was like no I'm Jane and he said oh sorry you just look so much like bill I assumed you'd

170
00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:01,040
 had a sex change and it was you it was all a thing to do say what you're like about Richard Maidley he's

171
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:09,760
 confident oh should we move on to our next facts okay this fact is from Chris R was at Nax Fish

172
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,960
 do we have it do we have Chris uh hello in the meantime shall I show my baby the fact that I got

173
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:20,320
 via email because I assume it's from someone who wasn't on Twitter Lauren Gilbert in 1958

174
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:26,080
 Chris Jeff went to Beijing to meet with Mao Mao proceeded to suggest a meeting while swimming

175
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:31,520
 knowing full well that Chris Jeff couldn't swim AIDS instantly appeared with water wings for Chris

176
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,600
 Jeff and the meeting took place with Mao swimming up and down and Chris Jeff flailing around in his

177
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:48,560
 arm bands okay who has the microphone hey hello hello go for it right um the police department in

178
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:53,680
 Cambridge Massachusetts requested that when the Harvard Bridge between Cambridge and Boston

179
00:18:53,680 --> 00:19:00,160
 was refurbished in the 1980s that the graffiti on it was maintained by the people who created it

180
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,800
 because it became beautifully and identifying where accidents were on the bridge so they would say

181
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:14,640
 by the penis it's quite nerdy graffiti to be honest okay oh yeah okay my favorite fact about

182
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:23,360
 graffiti oh graffiti is which is it James which is it this is about graffiti okay and it is that there

183
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:30,480
 was a Christian group I think it was in the south of France I think and they were um cleared cleaning

184
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,680
 up graffiti uh and they were doing it because they were very nice people and they started cleaning

185
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:39,280
 and cleaning and cleaning and cleaning and then only afterwards did they found out they'd actually

186
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:47,680
 cleaned off a lot of prehistoric cave paintings oh my god how did that I mean surely there's a

187
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:52,640
 difference that you can tell between that is true although you know I think that a lot of prehistoric

188
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,920
 cave paintings were done by teenage boys right actually and a lot of French graffiti is of buffaloes

189
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:04,960
 being killed can I read out because we got sent in so we got an email when we said we need

190
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,800
 facts for tonight and we got an email from a lady called Lauren Gilbert who we just had this fact

191
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:14,400
 from Anna about Krushchev which is that so she gave us ten and this was my favorite one I'm going to

192
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,920
 read it out exactly word for word what she's written F. Scott Fitzgerald bitched to Hemingway

193
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:26,000
 that is Dick was too small then went to the bathroom and Hemingway looked at it and pronounced it

194
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:32,800
 fine he had a terrible injury didn't he to his up I'm going of memory here Hemingway had a very bad

195
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:38,400
 shrapnel wound possibly in the first world war which so which dealt severe damage to that region

196
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:45,120
 like the top of his thighs and his parts and private parts and that there is a theory that that's

197
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:50,160
 why he was so err about the big game hunting and the fishing and so when so when Fitzgerald showed him

198
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:55,680
 it was sort of like half hanging off and bleeding a bit and he went looks absolutely normal to me

199
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:08,640
 you're doing fine mate let's move on and Steve at Croyd where are you okay can someone give

200
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:16,400
 the microphone to Steve there we are Steve what is your fact so the name Garrett is now as of 2013

201
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:22,880
 less popular in the UK that's by people born within that year than both the name Thor and Loki

202
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:31,120
 wow what that is incredible wow but Gary actually isn't like and it's isn't an old name is it the

203
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:36,080
 first Gary was a country singer wasn't he someone's going to shout out who it was Gary Cooper

204
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,000
 Gary Cooper yeah that's the very Cooper he was the first person pretty much I think called Gary and

205
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,600
 I think he might have been named after a place called Gary in America okay and in the other you see

206
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:53,600
 the world expert on Gary's isn't he what other name knowledge do you have then it's kind of

207
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:59,360
 limited to basically that and I definitely learned from a different podcast you brought someone else's

208
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:08,960
 fact from another podcast or so good do that all I thought it needs to raise the bar you know how many

209
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:17,680
 people in North Croyd you think are called Kim Jong Un do you know the answer is correct yeah there's

210
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:24,320
 only one person called Kim Jong Un because he made it all no he made the law that everyone else

211
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,280
 who had that name had to change their name to something else to Gary to be fair I don't

212
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:35,280
 reckon there are many Queen Elizabeth the seconds in Britain yeah I guess it would be Elizabeth

213
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,360
 Windsor with all the Elizabeth Windsors would have to change their name does anyone here know anyone

214
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,800
 called Elizabeth Windsor there we see nobody see nobody knows anyone called Elizabeth Windsor

215
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:49,600
 and that is a scientific experiment happened right in front of your eyes I got sent a fact by someone

216
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,960
 for tonight and it was a fantastic fact it was really good but I got so distracted by his name but I

217
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:01,040
 forgot to write his fact down so I don't have his fact now but I do have his name and his name is

218
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:09,280
 Andrew his surname go to bed as one word he's called Andrew go to bed and he goes by Andy and he has

219
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:14,400
 a middle name which is William but he goes by Will so Andy will go to bed is his full name is that

220
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,760
 great I found something about names the other day this is just completely random now but the first

221
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:26,160
 English the first teacher of the English language in Japan was called Ronald McDonald

222
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:38,320
 why did he move to Japan that's great okay another one let's keep going yeah let's pick another

223
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:45,200
 effects and to us by Twitter this is from @83_biss when the tooth of a mastodon was found in North America

224
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:51,840
 it was identified as the tooth of a giant now that's very exciting to me because if you've

225
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:57,920
 listened to this podcast we talk I talk a lot about yeties and so on I worked out that's the period

226
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:02,160
 I should have been born in when someone's finding a big thing and going well it's obviously the tooth

227
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:08,000
 of a giant that's that's right there that's when I should have been born I would have been the man who

228
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,280
 went what's clearly a giant and there we go mr. Schreiber you are well there was the other thing

229
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:18,720
 the first dinosaur bone which they thought was a scrotum of a giant and they called it scrotum

230
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:25,520
 humanum and it turned out to be a meglis I think but by the strict rules of nomenclature they should

231
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,440
 still call it scrotum humanum because you're supposed to call it the first thing that you called it

232
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:35,760
 are you yeah wow so meglis or I still call it a scrotum humanum actually but you as we've

233
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:43,120
 ascertained call it graffito that is true um sharks teeth when they were just got fossilized

234
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:48,000
 sharks teeth sharks obviously go really many many millions of years back and often their teeth are

235
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,720
 the only bit of them which survives because they are all cartilage they don't have any bones so

236
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,280
 we know we only really know about fossil fossil sharks or ancient sharks from their teeth but they

237
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:03,760
 were thought to be a dragon's teeth unsurprisingly and they were crushed into powder and sold as a medicine

238
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:09,360
 wow yeah and people still take bits of shark as medicine to this day but they shouldn't please

239
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:15,120
 don't do it because it doesn't work just got a dead shark then and you're not any better

240
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:23,040
 okay another one um esta Clark I really like the fact that people say alcohol is not a solution

241
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:33,440
 but according to chemistry alcohol is a solution that's very good all right so you like the chemistry

242
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:40,640
 jokes we don't like the logic jokes I hope you don't work at a DA said so that would be all right

243
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:46,560
 alcohol is not the solution except of course that it is the solution okay okay something's dissolved

244
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:51,120
 in something to make it alcohol yeah you could have pure alcohol but it's really hard to get

245
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:59,600
 out of most about most alcohol is in water so alcoholic drinks are the solution yeah pure alcohol

246
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,840
 is not pure alcohol's poisonous well that's very responsible so you're not advocating pure alcohol

247
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:11,120
 no I think that's okay so I think if you put water and alcohol together like 40% is about the best

248
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:16,480
 kind of solution for alcohol and water and the person you found that out was Mendelayev who did

249
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,280
 the periodic table and I think he did it for his dissertation or something like that and he worked

250
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:26,240
 that out so he was the first person to do it how did Mendelayev work out that 40% was the best he

251
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,520
 was a chemist and he tried lots out and that's yeah so there's no there's notebooks increasingly

252
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:39,280
 spidery and slurred towards the 55 to 45 that's okay if the joint ages that age used to have been in

253
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,560
 I should have lived in the age where you could just drink loads of alcohol and claim you're a chemist

254
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:51,520
 and this also reminds you of another brilliant fact that was sent in by email by Lauren I think

255
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:58,160
 which was that the first ICBMs the ballistic missiles placed by the USSR outside of the USSR

256
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:02,800
 which were placed in East Germany could never have been used because the soldiers in charge of them

257
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:09,680
 drank the rocket fuel because it was made of alcohol oh no that's like with the when

258
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:17,200
 it was they sent up a bit of bark from the tree that Newton was apparently sitting under when he

259
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:22,480
 had the apple and he realized the idea of gravity they sent that up into space with an apple and the

260
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,600
 idea was that they were going to drop the apple and they were going to drop the bit of bark together

261
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:30,400
 so that they could experience a lack of gravity so it was a very exciting moment but they forgot

262
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,960
 to tell some of the astronauts why the apple was up there and so they ate it and then they were like

263
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:40,480
 okay so I'm to do the experiments and they were going what experiment so they ended up doing the

264
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:46,480
 experiment with a bit of bark and a pair that they had no one likes pairs of the international

265
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:54,400
 should we move on to another fact? Yes and then you've got one I think. Yes I have this is from Adam

266
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:59,040
 hey Adam. Okay so I'll pass the mic over and while we're doing that I got a a tweet from someone

267
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:06,560
 called Olivia Annie at Olivia Annie and she sent me this fact that Bucharest and Budapest are the

268
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:14,080
 fifth most mixed up places in the world and she didn't say what the first fall were okay. Surely

269
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,480
 Slovenia is the back here. Yeah you're going to see. I don't know what the other was up but so I

270
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:26,240
 googled it and I found there was sites called Bucharest not Budapest.com which collects all the

271
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:32,640
 different times when people have mixed it up and Iron Maiden, Moor Chiba, Metallica, and Lenny Kravitz

272
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:39,120
 have all mistaken Bucharest for Budapest on stage. Cool okay where's the microphone?

273
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:46,960
 The wages in Chelsea and Fulham are so high that it's the only constituency in the UK where the

274
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:54,400
 average wage is higher than the wage of their MP. Wow. So their MP is like the working man.

275
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:01,280
 I know something about I think it's the constituency of Kensington which is nearby it's not not a

276
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:10,240
 million miles away and it has the highest proportion of miners as in MIN ERS in any constituency

277
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:22,560
 in the country and it's because it's a lot of people who own mines basically they say occupation

278
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:30,480
 mining. Okay let's move on let's try to get some more in before we finish so Chris who worries Chris.

279
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:37,040
 Okay so Apollo 13 nearly ended in disaster before it even got to space because of a malfunction

280
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:41,840
 that happened but a second malfunction occurred that saved the ship from being destroyed.

281
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:47,760
 What did it fix the first malfunction? Yeah pretty much. What? That's very rare.

282
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:57,120
 Good thing we have an asteroid physicist on the panel today. That's why I should have been born

283
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:06,800
 the age of space. That's incredible. That's amazing so okay so because there's a Apollo 13 my

284
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:11,200
 favorite movie of all time there it genuinely is. Was it a real thing that happened as well as the

285
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:17,600
 movie? Yeah yeah yeah yeah. Is it it's not your favorite event of all time is it? It kind of is

286
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:23,120
 actually no because it's to me Apollo 13 is the greatest story ever told you have a tin heading

287
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:28,560
 out into deep space. An explosion happens they're told they have something like an hour left of

288
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:33,360
 oxygen and they're going to die and everyone on the earth and three men and a tin can have to solve

289
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:38,640
 it and the only way that they can get back home is to go that way towards the moon. It's insane

290
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:44,640
 that is and they made it home with spoiler alert they made it home alive and that is incredible

291
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,640
 and then obviously there's a big line in the movie where as they're going up there is a malfunction

292
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,280
 and they say there was a glitch what was the line it was something like uh yeah so they say we just

293
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,880
 had our glitch for this mission. We just had our glitch for this mission not knowing that there

294
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:02,400
 was going to be this explosion. Obviously why would they have known? But so but this is an

295
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:07,200
 interesting fact as well about about glitches and things going wrong when you go into space.

296
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,760
 There was a book called Moon Dust and in it someone from NASA was saying that on a good successful

297
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:19,520
 space flight 99.99 percent of things work which means a typical ship is six million parts that means

298
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:24,480
 on a good flight they expect 6,000 things to break as they're going up. Did you just do that in your

299
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:32,800
 head right then? No. I was trying to style that out and my mouth didn't let me. 6,000. Yeah that's

300
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:37,520
 incredible. 6,000 things. Can you imagine any other job on the first time you use something?

301
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:42,800
 If I had 6,000 things break if I was running it I would take 6,000 very tiny very breakable glass

302
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:48,640
 plates. I'd smash all of them as we set off and then presumably everything else would work.

303
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:58,720
 Then then you understand probability at all. Just another fact about things going wrong in space.

304
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:04,880
 My wife told me this today in fact and that is that the two biggest disasters in

305
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:11,440
 rockets in Russian history both happened on the 24th of October on different years but they

306
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:16,320
 happened on the same day and so to this day in all the rocket fields and stuff in Russia they

307
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:20,640
 always turn all the electricity off and close everything down on that day just so it doesn't happen

308
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:29,520
 again. Really? Wow. There are lots of Russian cosmonauts and astronaut superstitions so lots of

309
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:35,040
 things have built up over the gears at the Russian space rocket. So I think on the final drive

310
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:40,080
 to the what is it the lift off point to the to the rocket ship? To the rocket ship, thank you.

311
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:46,480
 On the final drive the astronauts will get out they'll stop the car they'll get out and they'll

312
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:53,040
 have a wee against the right back wheel I think it is of the truck or the car. And that's a good

313
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:57,200
 guarantee that the first time you're a good guy I did it the first time. What if you get performance

314
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:02,320
 anxiety and you can't go? I presume that we need a launch. I'm trying! I'm trying!

315
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:09,520
 F's got Fitzgeralds going what the fuck is that? I mean we like to be!

316
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:19,200
 Okay should we keep going? Yeah let's see. Well this one is from Sophie S.

317
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:24,800
 Where are you Sophie S? I'll write in the corners so let's find another fact while we're doing that.

318
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:32,960
 Okay so here is the fact from @the_imageSmith and that is if you wanted to recreate the entire

319
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:39,920
 Lego movie with actual Lego you would need 15 million 80,330 Lego pieces.

320
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:47,760
 I mean yeah but why would you want to do that? We've got the Lego movie and it's the best

321
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:56,880
 thing it's ever been done. Yeah exactly. Have we got the microphone? So my fact is when a dog enters

322
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:05,920
 the room it knows what happened two hours before. What are you talking about? Did you learn this

323
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:11,680
 fact from me because I don't think. So you know what food was on the floor and who was on

324
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:18,960
 in the room before? Is it through smell or through smell? Oh it's through smell but I can't tell anyone

325
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:32,240
 that's so nuts. What are you saying buddy? I think he's hungry. Oh no but of course what a curse.

326
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:39,440
 The idea is that once we got dogs our brain shrunk isn't it? Oh yeah. And that is because when we were

327
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:44,160
 hunting we needed to be really good at picking up scents and really good at hearing things etc etc.

328
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:49,440
 And so then we got dogs and domesticated them and then we didn't need to smell those things anymore

329
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,880
 so that smell bit of our brain shrunk and then we didn't need to hear things and so they're hearing

330
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:57,680
 bit of our brain shrunk and it's been shown that humans that were around before dogs were domesticated

331
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:06,080
 did have bigger brains. Yeah. Wow that was just a fact. So there is a thing about anteaters which is

332
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:13,280
 that when anteaters eat ants they don't digest the ants that they eat. The ants digest themselves.

333
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:19,440
 Because the anteaters they don't have the proper acid in their stomach but ants obviously

334
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:26,240
 have lots of formic acid inside them so they just digest themselves. Wait so they do that as a kind of

335
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:33,760
 like Harry carry kind of thing? When they die they be eaten. They start to produce this form of

336
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,720
 acid and that then mulches the whole load of ants down. So anteaters have now again got rid of that

337
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:43,040
 unnecessary bit of their digestive system which they don't need anymore. That is actually a bit like

338
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,120
 and I actually I think someone also wrote this fact down today that baby pandas can't digest

339
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:54,320
 eucalyptus can they but it's koala sorry sorry. Baby pandas. Who's fat was that? Come up here quickly

340
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:59,360
 and say it was a baby koala is kind of just eucalyptus when they're first born so they have to get

341
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:04,720
 the bacteria from their mother's kind of poo to be able to digest eucalyptus. I don't reckon humans

342
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:09,360
 would be able to digest stuff without the bacteria in their stomachs and you get the bacteria from

343
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:15,680
 your mother through their breast milk. So like a baby probably wouldn't be able to digest you know

344
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:21,680
 Ben and Jerry's ice cream are. Damn it. It's not whether that's the most indigestible thing I could

345
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:27,600
 think of. Yeah yeah yeah. Do you think what's the thing that's least like baby food in the world?

346
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:36,560
 Colder milk. You've got to say steak or salmon on crude. We actually put out on Twitter. We said

347
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:42,720
 you could win two tickets tonight if you come up with the fact which is who was that? Was that you?

348
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:47,280
 Can you just yell out your fact because it's about Ben and Jerry's isn't it? Ben and Jerry's milk

349
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:52,960
 comes from massaged cows. What? So and I read into it basically Ben and Jerry's they have a big

350
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,880
 farm and they really look after their cows including before they milk them they're just like how are

351
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:09,360
 you today sir? Oh man I guess. That's not milk. That's why I was kicked out of the bullwrecks.

352
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:17,600
 Who's got the microphone? We had another fact coming out then we? Oh no we don't let's

353
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:25,760
 go. Okay Anna. I think it's another Anna. There's another other at the front. Okay let's find another

354
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:34,080
 fact from our Twitter list. Okay so I got one here. At Timothy underscore Johnson the motto of the

355
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:43,120
 Salvation Army is blood and fire. They were very unpopular for a while. People really didn't like

356
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:49,760
 a Salvation Army. Maybe that was the branding issue. No they were they're a Christian organisation

357
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:54,400
 and I think it was William Booth who set up the Salvation Army and he was known as the General. He

358
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:59,920
 was an incredibly organised and strict man and there was another army which was set up in opposition

359
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:06,080
 to the Salvation Army called I think the Skeleton Army and they made it their business to disrupt

360
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:10,800
 the Salvation Army in all their good works and they were bastards they were yeah they're really

361
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,640
 unpleasant people and they threw rocks at them and they threw you know burning stuff at the Salvation

362
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:20,960
 and whenever they turned up trying to help. Yeah wow not not funny but you know but was there also flowers

363
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:30,880
 and candy? I know what was your fight? Actually Tom says better. Well how one you tell us both and

364
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:37,680
 we'll decide which is the better fact. Okay so since 1945 our British tanks must come equipped

365
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:47,120
 with team-making supplies. That's how I imagine you exist in life Andy you you're in a tank

366
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:52,640
 and there's tea in there. That's that's a bad week milk you tea by the way of its Andy but

367
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,560
 I mean that's an office. This is off this stuff. This is why I say you can't work in a team.

368
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:04,320
 You're constantly throwing shade on my team. The worst thing is the milk came from Dan.

369
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:19,200
 So we let's hear the second fact. Okay no also I've read that all that is it JCBs are so popular

370
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,640
 as digging machines because they all have cattle's inside and that was the main feature.

371
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,240
 Wasn't that they dug better? Wasn't they could carry more stuff? They just have a cattle on board

372
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:33,520
 so you can make a cup of tea. Yeah I see. So what's the rival facts? Yeah. I didn't know it was a rival

373
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:43,520
 effects. It is how? Okay so Joseph Stalin had some Russian scientists attempt to create an

374
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:48,640
 ape human hybrid because he thought it would be useful in Russian industry and we'll be able to

375
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:59,840
 battle with stun pain. And how are you getting on them? Whoa I call a foul. How far down the

376
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:05,120
 process did he get? I don't know. They enjoyed the dinner but the bedroom was a complete disaster.

377
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:16,960
 But it was ultimately a failure. No. I mean he had the scientist who was leading the project

378
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:23,200
 exiled to Kazakhstan for failing. Wow that's tough because he probably didn't want that project

379
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:29,360
 in the first place. There was a there was a prediction. You know these cool old predictions they have

380
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:33,440
 of how life is going to be in the 21st century from a hundred years ago and they're always either

381
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:38,560
 spookly right or ridiculous. And one of them said that we won't have to drive our cars anymore.

382
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,640
 This is from I think the 20s from going off memory. We won't have to drive our cars anymore because

383
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:49,360
 we will have a race of hyper intelligent monkey butler creatures which will do the driving for us.

384
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,400
 That's the only thing we'll have told them to do. Well this ties in nicely with the twitter

385
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:58,000
 fact that we got sent by a guy called you and Taylor which is sorry this is Facebook. In 1953

386
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,760
 NASCAR driver Tim Flock raced for eight races with a racist monkey named Jocco Flocko

387
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:12,320
 as his co-driver. So maybe he was trying to start the revolution there or the evolution I don't know

388
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:17,520
 whatever. Let's do one more and we should wrap up as well. Why don't you choose Anna?

389
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,800
 Yeah Anna go for it. Yeah sorry I think I forgot about the whole fact choosing thing.

390
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:28,480
 Okay. It's from Steve. Steve, yeah. What about particle accelerators? Yes. This is the kind of

391
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:33,360
 crowd in which we could have two Steve's who both brought a fact about that. All right true.

392
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:40,880
 Okay let's read something out. I've got one. This is from at T.B. UK 2 to back 2.

393
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:47,920
 It's a twitter name. You may have already done this one. A consultant urologist at Musgrove Park

394
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:57,120
 Hospital in Taunton, Somerset is named Nicholas Burns Cox. He's my friend's dad. No. Really?

395
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:04,960
 Hello. Did you send us that fact? No. Oh my god. It's cool. Very cool.

396
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:10,960
 From Taunton. He's really nice. Wow. My mum's done the Taunton veil. Yeah, it's nice place.

397
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:16,160
 Can I just say we're focusing on the wrong bit of the fact.

398
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:29,120
 Talk to his nice, isn't it? Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Bridgewater said more of that.

399
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:35,440
 Oh no. Are urologist granddaughter or daughter owns Napoleon's penis now, doesn't she?

400
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:40,080
 What? I think yes, you're right. Yes, there's been bought and re-bought over the years and

401
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:44,400
 disappeared and then it was left with a urologist who died and he left it in his wilderness daughter.

402
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:49,680
 Yeah, there's a lot, so there's a lot of famous historical male penises that have been passed

403
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:53,920
 down through families, sold in orchid. Just male penises. Yeah, just the male ones.

404
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:59,280
 An email uterus is there. Napoleon's was described at auction as a mummified

405
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:04,560
 tendon, which is quite a delicate way of putting it. But it was an inch long. But it was described

406
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:15,040
 by Scott Fitzgerald. There's a very, very good size. Okay, okay, last fight. Final fact is from Steve.

407
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:22,080
 So the only man to ever stick his head in the path of particle accelerator, not only lived to

408
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:30,560
 complete his PhD, but also seems sort of not aged since the accident. What? Wait, was the accident

409
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:38,960
 this week? It was in 1978. What? Anatoly Bikorski was a researcher at

410
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:44,160
 something that I can't remember the name of because I'm an abacement and my notes have vanished

411
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:49,680
 up there with the Wi-Fi. Yeah, I think how we feel. Yeah, basically he was a researcher at an

412
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:57,360
 institute trying to complete his PhD and it was time to fix the particle accelerator. He stuck his head

413
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:04,640
 in it. Yeah, and the safety was apparently not working as well as it should have. And all of a sudden

414
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:10,560
 the particle accelerator fired and a beam passed through his head. And he, according to John

415
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:16,640
 words, he didn't feel any pain, but he did see a light brighter than a thousand suns. Yeah, wow.

416
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:24,080
 And the left side of his face is pretty much no wrinkles. Is he begging to shove the other side

417
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:29,360
 of his head into there? No, he's not. He's actually been interested for Western

418
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:34,800
 scientists to come over and say, hang out with him and say, "What's going on in my brain?"

419
