00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:20,000
 Hello and welcome to a new feature for Club Fish Members called "Dan Eats a Biscuit" while we are

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:29,520
 watching. No this feature is called "Memory Like a Fish" and what we're gonna do is we're gonna test

4
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:35,200
 Dan Schreiber and Anna Tyshinski about how well they remember episodes of No Such Things a Fish

5
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,960
 with a few little quiz questions and up against them is a man who was not on the episodes in

6
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,720
 question Mr John Lloyd and you can play along at home as well and the idea is to see how much

7
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,480
 these two remember about the shows compared to people who have listened to the shows or perhaps

8
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,040
 not even listened to the shows in Mr Lloyd's case. It is quite disconcerting that you've brought our

9
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:00,320
 boss here for this what seems to be a memory test about our work. Is this which one of us gets fired

10
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:08,960
 at the end of it? Yeah this is your annual review Anna. Jesus. So first of all I need to decide what

11
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:16,320
 episode we're gonna look at so Anna can you give me a number between one and ten? Four. Dan? Seven.

12
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:23,120
 Okay seven four and John can you give me a number one two or three please? Two. Two so we have two

13
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:31,840
 seven four. Okay so I'm going to look at episode 274. That felt so rigged. It's just a real Derren

14
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:40,080
 Brown move. Pick a card, any card. Is this your number? Okay so what I'm going to do is I'm going

15
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:45,840
 to read one of the facts because Andrew Hunter Murray who's not here today he keeps a spreadsheet

16
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:52,880
 of every fact that we've ever said. Now there are more than 25,000 facts in here but each

17
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,800
 show will have probably around you know 30 or 40. I'm going to choose a few of them. I'm going to

18
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:04,160
 miss out one of the words and you're going to tell me what the word is. Okay. Let's see if you remember

19
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:09,680
 them. Question number one this was the first fact in this show. But not the headline. This was the

20
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:19,920
 headline. So babies who live in London are more rude than blank. French. That's a good guess.

21
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,720
 Do you mean French people as in the entirety of French people are French babies? The concept.

22
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,080
 It sounds like you mean the French language. They're more rude than French.

23
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:37,280
 No I burp. I want to go for a serious answer here. Okay. Babies in the north. Oh yeah okay.

24
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,080
 Now there was only just one word. Is it? No it could be more than one word. You might expect?

25
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,800
 Then you might expect. Babies in London are more rude than you might expect.

26
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:56,560
 I think that's very good. Can I just say now since we did this episode I now have a baby who lives

27
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,560
 in London. And she's a real gobby cow, isn't she?

28
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:07,920
 That is true. We live near the Arsenal stadium or not far from it and at the moment whenever she

29
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:14,880
 kicks a football she says Arsenal! Arsenal! And your team is Tremere? Tremere Rovers.

30
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,640
 Yeah. I think it's child abuse if I make her support Tremere Rovers.

31
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,600
 That's good for her language skills. It's a tough set of words. Yeah well you struggled.

32
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:31,760
 Babies who live in London are more rude than... Is it specific? Is it Birmingham? Babies who live

33
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,200
 in Birmingham? I think Hannah's going to have to get the point here. Oh really? It's babies from the

34
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,800
 West Midlands of which Birmingham I would say is part. Damn it! I would say so too!

35
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:49,680
 Rude are in what way James? What doesn't it say? Well it is that a study of 2,500 babies found that

36
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,280
 London and Welsh babies are least likely to include thank you in their first words whereas

37
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,240
 normally in children the word sorry crops up quite a lot but less so in babies from London.

38
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:06,960
 Okay so this was a fact by me in this section. Common early words for babies to say

39
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:12,720
 are and I have six if you can guess any of them. Okay so arsenal.

40
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:19,600
 George Orwell's first word was beastly. Was it one of those? Oh was it? Really what a great

41
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,280
 fact. If you haven't listened, has the show about George Orwell gone out yet? No but we have talked

42
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,000
 about him recently. No it's not beastly. There's slightly more common words than that I would say.

43
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,920
 My son Harry's first words were hello big daddy. It just came out so well.

44
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:42,640
 The wrestler came to visit. John Heistachs he said. Oh I thought you were John Heistachs.

45
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:53,360
 So first six words of a baby. No they're six common first words. Mama. Mama I think. Mama daddy and

46
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:59,360
 anti-disestablishmentarianism. Mama and daddy I think are taken so these are apart from that.

47
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:09,360
 My youngest kid is saying hiya. Hiya. That's his first word yeah. Hiya. Hiya. Yeah he wants a lot

48
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:19,360
 of tally. It's a lot of karate movies actually. Is it no? It's not no. No. Is it uh doggie?

49
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:29,200
 Change one of those letters. Doggy. Correct doggie is one of them along with carrot cake quack banana

50
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:36,320
 and bird poo. Is that carrot cake or two separate objects carrot and cake? If you grow up in North

51
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:44,160
 London yeah the carrot cake and latte is another one. Yeah I like children mangled words that become

52
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,600
 a thing for the rest of people's lives. Buzz Aldrin got buzz off the back of brother being said

53
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:56,560
 in a distorted way by the sibling and buzz. Yeah there's so often those I think like grandparents

54
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,440
 names are often just how the kid mispronounces it first. Our grandparents are Gamma and Gappa

55
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,600
 and now I think there's one is Leely. When the queen was Gary wasn't she? Yeah because either Harry

56
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,760
 or William called her that. Yeah it's so funny. What do people in Thailand do related to babies

57
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:24,480
 to scare ghosts away? Oh they blow. Do they blow somewhere into their bottoms? Wow. Into their

58
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:32,000
 ear lobes. Into their bottoms. Do you know that Gandhi one of the reasons that he stopped drinking

59
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,720
 milk was he found out that farmers in India were increasing yields by blowing into the cow's vaginas?

60
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:47,200
 Oh yeah that has put me off milk a tiny bit. I'm sure repsable dairy farmers don't do that

61
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,560
 anymore but yeah. Well I don't know if there's anything wrong with it you just don't want to be

62
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,400
 picturing it as you're drinking your tea do you? I want to be in a cafe get I'm sorry this tastes

63
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:01,760
 of vagina blowing. Do you want milk? Soy milk or vagina blown milk? Well it's a Billy Connelly

64
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,600
 pointed out I mean who's the first type of dairy who thought I'm going to milk one of those.

65
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:15,440
 See those dangly bits? Pull on them. There's a drink in there. But yeah not that what would

66
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,320
 you do with your baby to scare ghosts away in Thailand? This was a damn fact you'll be

67
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:26,320
 not surprised to hear. Oh and I don't I don't remember it how interesting. Right okay um.

68
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:32,560
 Tickle it. Oh no as in the laughter could scare the ghosts away I suppose but no it's not that.

69
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,160
 Put a sheet over the head put two eye holes in it dress them up as another ghost

70
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,640
 and then the ghost won't bother. The ghost comes in and goes well this place is already haunted.

71
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:51,760
 No it is that they would call their babies the name ugly so you'd say this baby is ugly

72
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:56,240
 and the ghost apparently would think well if there's an ugly baby here I don't want to be here.

73
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,920
 Wow this ghost is very judgmental. This is your fact dad. I have no memory of ever saying that

74
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,920
 that's amazing. How do you remember how can you possibly remember all those episodes all those

75
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,520
 facts? It is one of the weirdest things when you listen back to an old episode and you hear yourself

76
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,400
 talking and you're saying facts that you have no memory of you have no memory of the sentence

77
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,880
 being said. I know the actors have this a lot there's a story in Stephen Fry's autobiography

78
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:25,440
 where he is walking on the street and someone from the other side of the road yells really loudly

79
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:31,120
 you killed Speckle Jim and he goes what and this man it starts chasing him and Stephen's

80
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,840
 walking away and he says no no sorry sorry Speckle Jim Blackadder Blackadder goes forth

81
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:42,480
 that was your bird which you probably remember John but he didn't because for him that was

82
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:48,800
 a single line and a thing that he did all those years ago. Okay going on to the next fact now

83
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:54,960
 from that episode I hope you're keeping scars at home at the moment Anna has one point and no one

84
00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:01,920
 else has any points but Dan's fact in this episode was in 17th century Japan the super rich would

85
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:07,440
 protect their homes from burglars by what? Okay so I know the answer and I feel because I because

86
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:14,240
 it is my fact I'll sit it out for the purposes. Do you want to give a clue? Oh you get a point

87
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:20,480
 in a minute okay. Yeah I mean I could give a clue. Yeah give a clue. If you're at home at night

88
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:27,760
 you're often alerted to a presence by noise. Oh so 10 cans or something like that. You're in

89
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:36,640
 the kind of right zone. No 10 cans in 17th century Japan. No. Swords. Oh that's a nice idea. What are

90
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:43,840
 the other things that what what are the animals that was it an animal? No. It's like an alarm system.

91
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:48,160
 Is it like they used to put buckets full of baked beans on top of the door and then when they open

92
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:54,720
 the door it falls on their heads. They go oh fuck baked beans. Yeah. I always love that idea that

93
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,600
 burglars always knock on the front door before they enter before they burgle. Obviously they would.

94
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,600
 Yeah that does make sense. Yeah that's so funny. But that is interesting because I don't really like

95
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,560
 cancering my front door very often. If someone comes to my front door I'm like oh I don't want to

96
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,520
 answer that. There's a thing I saw on Instagram that was one of those intelligence tests which says

97
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:20,560
 a woman's in her hotel room and there's a knock at the door and she opens it and the guy says

98
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,600
 I'm so sorry I thought it was my room and and then she calls the police why she calls reception.

99
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:32,880
 Did he have a um stripy shirt and a big bag? No no but of course you don't knock on your own

100
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:39,200
 hotel room do you? Oh very good. I do love the idea. Every time there's a knock on our door at

101
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,920
 home now I'm going to say actually can you get there because it might be a burglar.

102
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:51,520
 I'm going to get my point. Go on Dan. It's um you would deliberately make the floorboards or a

103
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:56,880
 few of the floorboards creaky and squeaky so that when the burglar was coming in you could hear the

104
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:02,320
 noise of the and they would do things like add bits of metal that would slap down the floorboard

105
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,560
 to amplify sounds and stuff. Absolutely right they were you called the musical floorboards

106
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,920
 and then you said that they were known as nightingale floors. Yes that's right because they tweeted

107
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:20,080
 like nightingales so Dan gets a point unless we edit this bit out. So this is another one from

108
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:26,800
 Dan see if you remember this Dan. It was about a man whose house had been burgled and the burglar

109
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,040
 was found. I know exactly which house it was. Do you? How do you remember this? This is because

110
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:37,120
 one of the best stories I've ever heard in ten years of doing fish. So it's related to a computer.

111
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,760
 Sorry the burglar was found. Different one, different one. I want to hear the one that Dan's

112
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,560
 got. Go on Dan tell us which one yours is. I love that there's a story that a burglar was in a house

113
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:52,160
 and thought the house was going to be empty for quite some time and then suddenly the front door

114
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,760
 goes and the couple come back. So it quickly goes what do I do? Runs upstairs and hides in the bedroom

115
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,320
 I think under the bed just waiting there thinking oh what do I do? They discover that he's in the

116
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,280
 house because he can hear the couple chatting downstairs and the husband says or the wife says

117
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:13,440
 do you want to hear a joke? Tells the joke and afterwards they hear upstairs some are going

118
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:22,160
 That was you have said that but that wasn't in this episode. So this was something else

119
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,120
 it was something to do with computers and this guy got caught after having burgled someone's house.

120
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:33,280
 So it's either he took um deleting his search history he took screen grab to himself or like

121
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:38,880
 photos you know with where you can make your head go you know like a like an hourglass. Lisa looking

122
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:46,720
 for an hourglass head. No but you're definitely in the right tracks. John said google history yeah

123
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,440
 we're getting there getting close okay signed into facebook. What checked all of his messages

124
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:59,120
 checked all of his emails. I forgot to log out. You're too relaxed as a burglar if you're just

125
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:06,320
 catching up on your tweets. The next fact was mine and it was according to its ingredients list

126
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:14,880
 pepperami contains 108% pork. Yes. Now my question for you is one of Andy's facts he said that pepper

127
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:20,080
ami launched a mass porking ad campaign. I'd like you to tell me what that entailed.

128
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:28,160
 Well a lot of people are still receiving treatment results of it. It was a lot of trouble for that.

129
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:35,520
 It was called mass porking and it was like helping society in a way pepperami was doing.

130
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:41,680
 I remember because weirdly that your fact is almost like a classic fact that we that we said I think

131
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,520
 it's even appeared in like a photo or something where we used to write facts down something like

132
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:50,560
 that but then it's making me think of Andy's this won't be it but Andy's classic fact if we have

133
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:56,880
 sweet as meatballs. No of the remember the sausage gun that could shoot however many sausages per

134
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,040
 minute. How interesting I thought you're going to say in German if you don't understand something

135
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,600
 you might say it's sausage to me. Yeah it's all sausage to me yeah. This was one do you remember

136
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,760
 before Andy was Andy was really obsessed with mass he was obsessed with sausages. Yeah he's had

137
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:17,120
 it before he went vegetarian. It was you're right we could almost bracket eras of the podcast

138
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:24,240
 based on like the sausage dynasty the moss dynasty. Yeah yeah like Picasso's blue period yeah sausage

139
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:32,480
 period. What do you think the mass porking might have been? Do they sort of wave them at each other?

140
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,520
 Do you have to wave them in public that kind of thing? Okay you're getting there because it is

141
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:43,520
 about drawing attention. To do with roads I don't know if people listening can hear there's a bit

142
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:48,480
 of clanking going on outside there's some building work happening. With they used kind of like you

143
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,840
 know that old fact that it's almost like one of the first QI facts I ever heard about Mills and Boone

144
00:14:53,840 --> 00:15:01,920
 books being the basis for yeah for a highway. Yeah to fill in potholes? Anna has got it. Wow!

145
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:08,160
 They filled a hundred potholes with pepperamis to highlight the problem of potholes and they

146
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:15,280
 called it a mass porking. Wow that's good. I do sort of feel like I'm kicking over a header for you

147
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:20,880
 you know I said the north you said Birmingham. Dan I'm sorry but on the score sheet it's just

148
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:27,360
 about the gold in the end. Exactly there are no diagrams on the score sheet. Let's go on to the

149
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:33,840
 final fact of the show which was Anna's. Baby songbirds have inbuilt blank. Do you remember

150
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:41,440
 it Anna? You think I would? Well they've got inbuilt lots of things haven't they? Yeah inbuilt scores

151
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:53,680
 to all of Mozart in there. Oh yeah yeah yeah Greensleeves. Ringtones. There's a U2 album inside

152
00:15:53,680 --> 00:16:00,880
 them. This is tough I must say. Pockets? I want to say pockets. Oh okay we are getting very close

153
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:09,120
 very very close. Oh well here you go Anna aren't you? I mean this I would say this is a pocket

154
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:16,000
 apart from you wouldn't want to mistake it for a pocket. Ah secret anus. So close. Like a second anus.

155
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,760
 So close. A second vagina. Colossomy bag. As close as you could possibly get without being

156
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,600
 correct. An inbuilt colostomy bag is surely just a large intestine.

157
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:39,040
 That's an excellent point. I think younger. Nappies. Nappies yes. They have fecal sacs especially

158
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:44,640
 passerine birds including robins and bluebirds. When in the nest they turn their rear end at their

159
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:50,160
 parent and eject a white bag of poo encased in A and then I can't read the rest of it because

160
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:56,400
 the spreadsheet doesn't have enough space. I could scroll but I think. Do I get a point then?

161
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:03,520
 Yeah yes. Oh you do. I really don't remember that at all. Wow. Okay so the Egyptian vulture

162
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:13,920
 it likes to eat something to enhance its colour. What is that? Strawberries.

163
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:23,120
 Brilliant. Bananas. What colour are they? They're kind of yellowish. Okay so lemons.

164
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:31,120
 I mean what I. I think it's vomit. No not vomit. They do vomit. There are various vomit

165
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,560
 vulture related facts and then there's always that thing about vultures and I don't know if this is

166
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:39,600
 a clue to this but where they've got no hair on their necks have they and that's so they can stick

167
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:45,440
 their head into the soft openings of animals that they're scavenging without getting poo all over

168
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:51,360
 there. Yes that's right. Neck hair so it's not poo because that is quite yellow sometimes if you've

169
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:57,840
 recently had a curry. Yeah you're absolutely right it's yellow cow dung. Oh wow. So they find some

170
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:03,680
 yellow cow dung and they will roll around in it just rub their beak in it and eat it and that

171
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:08,080
 enhances their yellow colour and makes them more yellow. It would be super cool if we all turned

172
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,360
 the colour of the food that we were eating there. Yeah what what food would you eat a lot of?

173
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:17,280
 Oh god great question. Blueberries I think it's gotta be. That would be fun yeah if you're going

174
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:23,440
 for a smurfy sort of work. Yeah yeah avocado. Oh you'd go green. Yeah would you? I mean just for

175
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,360
 the sake of not being cancelled I'm gonna stay away from things like Vegemite I would say.

176
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:37,200
 You're right that would be out of fun. Shame. And then let's do one more this was the final fact

177
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:45,760
 that we mentioned in the entire show and it was an anaphact in 2012 a study in Vietnam found that

178
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:53,520
 all Vietnamese mothers all Vietnamese mothers we say. I'm worried about this. Train their children

179
00:18:53,520 --> 00:19:01,520
 to we on command. At a whistle. Sorry I've cheated. You didn't cheat unless you looked at the answer.

180
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,080
 Oh I suppose I looked at it once five years ago when I first said this fact. Is it whistling?

181
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,400
 You're absolutely right. Right. And do you still stand by the fact that all Vietnamese women

182
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,280
 train their children so we on whistle? Stand by it and if you're if you're Vietnamese and you

183
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:21,840
 don't then you're not really Vietnamese. Check your genealogy. Horses get trained to pee on whistles

184
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:28,720
 as well don't they? Not pee on whistles but like to hear a whistle and yeah. Do you remember we

185
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:34,080
 did that fact about there was the roof of a church that needed restoration and they needed

186
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:40,560
 horse urine in order to. Oh the one in Scandinavia somewhere. Yeah and someone volunteered their

187
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:47,440
 old horse who used to pee in a bucket and I think whistling was maybe I've conflated

188
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:56,240
 the children with the horses. No I feel like you're right. Easily done. And that is the end

189
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:02,880
 of our little quiz and I can say after that assuming that we don't edit anything out that Anna has to

190
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:08,720
 be the winner I think Mr Lloyd got one, Mr Shriver got one or two. There was one where it just the

191
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:15,120
 point wasn't acknowledged and we moved on and so you got one then. But Anna I think got two or

192
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:21,520
 three or maybe even four thanks to Dan crossing them in and out and nodding them home. If you are

193
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,080
 listening and you know where our discord is then why don't you tell us how you did in the quiz.

194
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:31,760
 You can find it if you don't know it's going to discord and it is called fish cord. I think

195
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:37,120
 if you go to knowsichsingersoffish.com/fishcord you can find out where that is. So let us know how

196
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:44,800
 you did especially if you beat these idiots. But maybe we'll try this again sometime and see

197
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:50,160
 how well we remember our facts. Thank you very much for listening. We'll see you again soon.

198
00:20:50,160 --> 00:21:01,360
 Goodbye.
