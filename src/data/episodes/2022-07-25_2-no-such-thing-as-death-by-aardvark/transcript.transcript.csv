00:00:00,00:00:01,We run it on QI a few years ago.
00:00:01,00:00:02,Yeah.
00:00:02,00:00:04,"Um, which was, there's no such thing as a fish."
00:00:04,00:00:05,You didn't know such thing as a fish.
00:00:05,00:00:09,"No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life."
00:00:09,00:00:11,"He says it right there, first paragraph."
00:00:11,00:00:12,No such thing as a fish.
00:00:12,00:00:15,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:00:15,00:00:24,"Oh, and welcome to the second episode of ""No Such Thing as a Fish."""
00:00:24,00:00:27,This is a QIELF podcast coming to you from our office
00:00:27,00:00:29,is in Covenant Garden.
00:00:29,00:00:30,"We want to say, first of all, thanks to everyone who"
00:00:30,00:00:33,listened to the first episode that we put out last week.
00:00:33,00:00:34,Got huge numbers.
00:00:34,00:00:35,We weren't expecting it.
00:00:35,00:00:37,And really great feedback.
00:00:37,00:00:40,There's a lot of technical hiccups that we are sorting out.
00:00:40,00:00:42,We're going to get on with this second podcast now.
00:00:42,00:00:43,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:43,00:00:46,I am sitting here with three other QIELs--
00:00:46,00:00:49,James Harkin and H. Azinsky and Andy Murray.
00:00:49,00:00:51,"And once again, we're huddled around our microphone."
00:00:51,00:00:53,And these are the best facts that we found out
00:00:53,00:00:54,from the last seven days.
00:00:54,00:00:56,"So in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:56,00:01:00,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:01:00,00:01:01,"OK, first fact."
00:01:01,00:01:03,"And let's go with you, Anna."
00:01:03,00:01:06,"Yeah, I found out this week that the first ever sandwich"
00:01:06,00:01:08,that we know about contained wine.
00:01:08,00:01:10,"Yeah, but it was a wine sandwich."
00:01:10,00:01:11,What?
00:01:11,00:01:11,"Well, it is."
00:01:11,00:01:12,It's a sandwich.
00:01:12,00:01:13,I think it's a bread with wine.
00:01:13,00:01:15,"We had had other stuff in it, but wine was one of the ingredients."
00:01:15,00:01:19,"Yeah, so the first recorded sandwich was actually more of a wrap."
00:01:19,00:01:20,It was called a correction.
00:01:20,00:01:24,"It was invented by Hillel, who's a Jewish religious leader from,"
00:01:24,00:01:25,"like, 100 BC."
00:01:25,00:01:28,"So the Jews have been, like, at this festival eating wine"
00:01:28,00:01:32,"and figs and spices and stuff all mixed up together for about 1,000 years."
00:01:32,00:01:35,And he decided to just shove it between some flatbread.
00:01:35,00:01:38,And part of the concoction was wine and mixed up--
00:01:38,00:01:41,So this isn't the Earl of Sandwich's invention.
00:01:41,00:01:43,"I'm doing the inverted colors side there,"
00:01:43,00:01:44,and I say that.
00:01:44,00:01:46,So this is way before that.
00:01:46,00:01:47,This is way before that.
00:01:47,00:01:50,The Earl of Sandwich claims credit where it's not G.
00:01:50,00:01:51,"Yeah, I never heard that."
00:01:51,00:01:53,And that's actually-- I don't think we've
00:01:53,00:01:56,"done that genig on QI who invented the sandwich, have we?"
00:01:56,00:01:59,"No, but what did the other sandwich do, if anything?"
00:01:59,00:02:01,I think he was the first person to--
00:02:01,00:02:04,"I mean, he probably wasn't, but he was known for shoving meat"
00:02:04,00:02:05,between bread and the West.
00:02:05,00:02:09,"People say it's because he was a, like, a gracious gambler, yeah."
00:02:09,00:02:12,"Well, there's no way that he invented the sandwich anyway,"
00:02:12,00:02:15,"is that because, like, obviously, for, like you say,"
00:02:15,00:02:18,"for ever, people have been putting things in between two slices of meat."
00:02:18,00:02:19,"Yeah, it's so obvious."
00:02:19,00:02:23,I think I'd like this idea of people just putting their name to something
00:02:23,00:02:25,which has been invented for so long.
00:02:25,00:02:30,"Like, in 1999 in Japan, someone patented curry."
00:02:30,00:02:31,Wow.
00:02:31,00:02:31,Yeah.
00:02:31,00:02:34,"What happened was the very next year, 80 people"
00:02:34,00:02:36,"tried to patent pizza after this, huh?"
00:02:36,00:02:37,"Really, yeah."
00:02:37,00:02:39,"Well, there was a guy in Australia who successfully"
00:02:39,00:02:41,"painted in the wheel, right?"
00:02:41,00:02:42,"Oh, yeah."
00:02:42,00:02:43,Successfully?
00:02:43,00:02:44,"Yeah, successfully."
00:02:44,00:02:46,But that was actually the first wheel in Australia.
00:02:46,00:02:47,It was just 20 years ago.
00:02:47,00:02:50,[LAUGHTER]
00:02:50,00:02:51,"Yeah, he did."
00:02:51,00:02:52,He successfully did it.
00:02:52,00:02:53,And it made it past.
00:02:53,00:02:58,And he did it as a kind of parody protest
00:02:58,00:03:02,to show how things were getting through the net when it came to patents.
00:03:02,00:03:02,"Oh, thank you."
00:03:02,00:03:05,Because I think to a lot of people getting stuff stolen in Australia
00:03:05,00:03:06,as an invention.
00:03:06,00:03:07,And so--
00:03:07,00:03:08,OK.
00:03:08,00:03:08,"Yeah, he successfully did it."
00:03:08,00:03:13,I remember the guy in the '70s who patented the colmover.
00:03:13,00:03:14,"Oh, yeah."
00:03:14,00:03:17,"Obviously that's been happening forever, but yeah, yeah."
00:03:17,00:03:21,This is from the Wikipedia about the sandwich full disclosure.
00:03:21,00:03:23,"But what it says is, before being known as sandwiches,"
00:03:23,00:03:25,this food combination seems to simply
00:03:25,00:03:27,have been known as bread and meat.
00:03:27,00:03:30,[LAUGHTER]
00:03:30,00:03:31,Or meat and bread.
00:03:31,00:03:33,"Or meat and bread, cheese."
00:03:33,00:03:36,[LAUGHTER]
00:03:36,00:03:38,"Hang on, I just thought that would work for all fillings."
00:03:38,00:03:38,Yeah.
00:03:38,00:03:40,You just bread and--
00:03:40,00:03:41,"Yeah, bread and cheese and bread and cheese."
00:03:41,00:03:42,Yeah.
00:03:42,00:03:45,"I'm just going to go and have a cheese and ham, bread and cheese and ham."
00:03:45,00:03:48,[LAUGHTER]
00:03:48,00:03:54,I was thinking about-- because the idea of wine going into a sandwich
00:03:54,00:03:56,is it's a nice thing about what else goes into a sandwich
00:03:56,00:03:57,that you would not expect.
00:03:57,00:03:59,"But then I started thinking, oh, but there's a lot of stuff"
00:03:59,00:04:02,that goes into wine that we don't expect.
00:04:02,00:04:02,OK.
00:04:02,00:04:04,But there's a nettle wine.
00:04:04,00:04:06,So nettle being those stingy knives.
00:04:06,00:04:07,"Yeah, so you can get nettle."
00:04:07,00:04:09,"That's a cannabis wine, which is available,"
00:04:09,00:04:11,which has become really popular in the US.
00:04:11,00:04:12,This is my favorite one.
00:04:12,00:04:14,It's a chilean wine.
00:04:14,00:04:16,And it's been created using meaty right
00:04:16,00:04:18,for them during the birth of a solar system.
00:04:18,00:04:19,What?
00:04:19,00:04:22,"Yeah, so it's a-- it's been developed by a guy called Ian Hutchin."
00:04:22,00:04:24,He's an English guy working in Chile.
00:04:24,00:04:25,It's a meteorite that's believed to have
00:04:25,00:04:29,"crashed in the Atacama desert in northern Chile,"
00:04:29,00:04:31,"about 6,000 years ago."
00:04:31,00:04:34,And it's submerged in the wine during the fermentation process.
00:04:34,00:04:37,"Yeah, so it's a meaty right wine."
00:04:37,00:04:38,"I mean, that's--"
00:04:38,00:04:39,"Well, that's pretty cool."
00:04:39,00:04:41,"Yeah, I really want to tell you that."
00:04:41,00:04:44,"In China, you can get something called three penis wine."
00:04:44,00:04:45,Can you guess what's in that?
00:04:45,00:04:47,Two penises.
00:04:47,00:04:49,"No, three penises."
00:04:49,00:04:53,It does contain three different penises.
00:04:53,00:04:54,Of what?
00:04:54,00:04:55,"OK, so deer."
00:04:55,00:04:56,"Yeah, deer is one of them."
00:04:56,00:04:59,And it's supposed to be like a general pick me up kind of.
00:04:59,00:05:01,"But deer, maybe a bird?"
00:05:01,00:05:02,One of the birds with a penis?
00:05:02,00:05:04,"Yeah, most birds don't have penises today."
00:05:04,00:05:07,97% of bird species have no penises.
00:05:07,00:05:09,"But the other three, some of them"
00:05:09,00:05:12,"have very, very positive players."
00:05:12,00:05:13,Yeah.
00:05:13,00:05:14,The Argentinian lake dot.
00:05:14,00:05:17,45 centimeters and curled.
00:05:17,00:05:19,And that's just a blu-tit.
00:05:19,00:05:22,"If you're listening to this at home,"
00:05:22,00:05:25,Google Argentinian lake dot penis.
00:05:25,00:05:27,And you'll see exactly what Andy's talking about.
00:05:27,00:05:29,It is epic.
00:05:29,00:05:29,Wow.
00:05:29,00:05:31,"Well, what's the third penis?"
00:05:31,00:05:32,I can't remember.
00:05:32,00:05:33,History penis.
00:05:33,00:05:34,History penis.
00:05:34,00:05:35,History.
00:05:35,00:05:36,Lucky did penis.
00:05:36,00:05:39,Penis du jour.
00:05:39,00:05:40,There is one other wine.
00:05:40,00:05:43,"It's a Japanese wine, which is called Japanese feces wine."
00:05:44,00:05:47,It's no-dose tongsul.
00:05:47,00:05:51,And it's primarily made using human or animal feces.
00:05:51,00:05:55,So what's the third kind of feces?
00:05:55,00:05:59,I'm going to give you one.
00:05:59,00:06:02,I'm going to trump that even for a disgusting wine.
00:06:02,00:06:05,"In 1495, it was reported that the Spanish"
00:06:05,00:06:08,were mixing the blood of lepers with their wine
00:06:08,00:06:11,and feeding it to the French as a only kind of biological
00:06:11,00:06:14,warfare.
00:06:14,00:06:15,"Well, they're war at the time."
00:06:15,00:06:16,It wasn't a preemptive.
00:06:16,00:06:18,OK.
00:06:18,00:06:19,"No, sorry, leper war."
00:06:19,00:06:20,Lepper's blood.
00:06:20,00:06:22,But it probably wouldn't have done any harm.
00:06:22,00:06:23,No.
00:06:23,00:06:28,"Because 90% of people, 95, are immune to Hansen's disease."
00:06:28,00:06:30,Hansen's disease are leprosy anyway.
00:06:30,00:06:31,And a lot of people will probably
00:06:31,00:06:35,misidentifying leprosy even then as other skin conditions.
00:06:35,00:06:36,I'd really like to quickly say a word
00:06:36,00:06:40,"for about the Earl of Sandwich, because I love him."
00:06:40,00:06:41,It's actually the current Earl of Sandwich.
00:06:41,00:06:43,"I wanted to mention the 11th Earl of Sandwich,"
00:06:43,00:06:46,"who's direct descendant of the Earl of Sandwich, because he--"
00:06:46,00:06:49,"so he's obviously thought, I'm the Earl of Sandwich."
00:06:49,00:06:51,And I've got this son called Orlando.
00:06:51,00:06:53,So he's got Orlando who's going to be the Earl of Sandwich.
00:06:53,00:06:55,So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go and set up
00:06:55,00:06:59,a sandwich shop and go into business with this guy called
00:06:59,00:07:02,"Robert Earl, and it's going to be in Orlando."
00:07:02,00:07:03,And so that's what he did.
00:07:03,00:07:05,So the current Earl of Sandwich owns the sandwich shop
00:07:05,00:07:07,"in Disneyland, Orlando."
00:07:07,00:07:08,Called Orlando Blumas.
00:07:08,00:07:10,It should be.
00:07:10,00:07:11,It should be.
00:07:11,00:07:12,It's called the Earl of Sandwich.
00:07:12,00:07:16,"The good thing about the Disneyland in Tokyo,"
00:07:16,00:07:18,"you'll know this better than me, Andy,"
00:07:18,00:07:23,"but didn't the not one of the North Korean Kim Jong, you know, this guy?"
00:07:23,00:07:26,One of Kim Jong Il's three sons was disinherited
00:07:26,00:07:28,for going to one of the Disneyland's.
00:07:28,00:07:29,Really?
00:07:29,00:07:30,"Yeah, right?"
00:07:30,00:07:32,"He had three sons, and the first two botched it."
00:07:32,00:07:34,"And I can't remember how the other one did,"
00:07:34,00:07:37,but Kim Jong Nam is the eldest son of Kim Jong Il.
00:07:37,00:07:44,And he was detained in Japan with a fraudulent passport in 2001.
00:07:44,00:07:47,He was trying to pass himself off as a Dominican named
00:07:47,00:07:51,"Pang Xiong, which translates as Fat Bear in Chinese."
00:07:51,00:07:53,And so they deported him.
00:07:53,00:07:57,"But he was trying to visit Tokyo, Disneyland, with his family."
00:07:57,00:08:00,I got told the other day that who is this?
00:08:00,00:08:02,"Someone I know went to South Korea,"
00:08:02,00:08:05,and they stood at the border of South Korea and North Korea.
00:08:05,00:08:09,And apparently what you see when you're at the South looking at the North
00:08:09,00:08:12,is a huge cardboard cutout of a city
00:08:12,00:08:14,that North Korea has put up to give the impression
00:08:14,00:08:17,that they're a huge metropolis from South Korea.
00:08:17,00:08:20,"Oh, OK, they call them Potemkin towns, don't they?"
00:08:20,00:08:22,"Yeah, but it's just, it's like, literally like,"
00:08:22,00:08:25,"imagine the Hollywood sign, but done as a ginormous looking city."
00:08:25,00:08:27,So that's what you see when you--
00:08:27,00:08:29,What happens when it rains?
00:08:29,00:08:31,"What's made of, like, I'm sure they laminated it, for some reason."
00:08:31,00:08:33,"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:08:33,00:08:34,What's the--
00:08:34,00:08:37,There isn't an extra area at the border where they both work.
00:08:37,00:08:39,That was where there were a lot of recent tension.
00:08:39,00:08:42,And they shut down called the Kaisom industrial area.
00:08:42,00:08:43,And actually workers from both countries
00:08:43,00:08:46,"go into it every day, thousands of them work together."
00:08:46,00:08:47,So there's this one weird point of contact
00:08:47,00:08:49,between the two countries.
00:08:49,00:08:51,What my favorite fact about that part of the world
00:08:51,00:08:54,"is it's called the demilitarized zone, isn't it?"
00:08:54,00:08:55,Yes.
00:08:55,00:08:57,But it's the world's most militarized zone.
00:08:57,00:08:59,"Yeah, that's it."
00:08:59,00:09:00,"That's all right, isn't it?"
00:09:00,00:09:02,Why isn't that the one in the house that it's on?
00:09:02,00:09:04,I can't say.
00:09:04,00:09:05,I missed out on so many opportunities.
00:09:05,00:09:06,Didn't scan.
00:09:06,00:09:08,[LAUGHTER]
00:09:08,00:09:10,We should have been written QI version.
00:09:10,00:09:11,I don't know.
00:09:11,00:09:12,I'll land it as more as that.
00:09:12,00:09:17,"OK, let's move on to fact two."
00:09:17,00:09:19,"James, this is your effect."
00:09:19,00:09:20,"Yeah, I like this one."
00:09:20,00:09:25,"It's in 2003, three people in Mexico died of acne."
00:09:25,00:09:26,So--
00:09:26,00:09:26,I love that.
00:09:26,00:09:28,I'm pretty sure you can't die of acne.
00:09:28,00:09:29,I know.
00:09:29,00:09:30,I don't know how they died.
00:09:30,00:09:34,This just came from a list of the ways that people died.
00:09:34,00:09:36,So it's on nationmaster.com.
00:09:36,00:09:39,And it gives all of the mortality stats
00:09:39,00:09:41,for all the different countries.
00:09:41,00:09:44,"And so if you looked for people dying of acne,"
00:09:44,00:09:47,"there were seven deaths worldwide, three of which"
00:09:47,00:09:48,occurred in Mexico.
00:09:48,00:09:50,"And what I think it is, it's just the way"
00:09:50,00:09:51,that they do their stats.
00:09:51,00:09:54,"And other countries might have people dying of the same thing,"
00:09:54,00:09:55,but they don't say it's a vaccine.
00:09:55,00:09:58,So they just died with acne?
00:09:58,00:09:59,Yeah.
00:09:59,00:10:01,Let's just say it's that.
00:10:01,00:10:02,Because I can see that.
00:10:02,00:10:04,And I don't have to cut a movie.
00:10:04,00:10:06,It looks to me like you died of being a five foot six male.
00:10:06,00:10:08,Yeah.
00:10:08,00:10:10,"Yeah, maybe they just, they have to write--"
00:10:10,00:10:13,they have to tick a box of what they died with and the acne
00:10:13,00:10:15,is right at the very top.
00:10:15,00:10:16,And they just lay eyes.
00:10:16,00:10:20,"The first answer was, yeah, it's an ailment right at the top."
00:10:20,00:10:21,"Is it on Varka, does he?"
00:10:21,00:10:21,No.
00:10:21,00:10:22,"So yeah, it's going to be--"
00:10:22,00:10:24,It could be killed by an arid vark.
00:10:24,00:10:24,Yeah.
00:10:24,00:10:25,Death.
00:10:25,00:10:28,They don't have a list of people who were killed by animals.
00:10:28,00:10:34,"27 worldwide in 2003, people killed by contact with millipedes,"
00:10:34,00:10:35,which is pretty cool.
00:10:35,00:10:36,Poisonous millipedes?
00:10:36,00:10:37,"Or, yeah, venomous ones."
00:10:37,00:10:40,And I think five of those were in El Salvador.
00:10:40,00:10:42,I seem to remember you telling me ages ago
00:10:42,00:10:46,"that in Australia, no one's died of this."
00:10:46,00:10:48,And no one's ever died in Australia.
00:10:48,00:10:49,It's really interesting.
00:10:49,00:10:49,Yeah.
00:10:49,00:10:51,But we don't have acne in Australia.
00:10:51,00:10:52,"So no, it's not."
00:10:52,00:10:54,But no one's been by spider or snake
00:10:54,00:10:56,has died in the last 50 years.
00:10:56,00:10:59,It's certainly been a long time since a spider bite killed anyone
00:10:59,00:11:03,"because they have very good antivenom, though, in Australia."
00:11:03,00:11:05,I think it was the 1980s.
00:11:05,00:11:06,"And I just remember looking this up,"
00:11:06,00:11:09,because I got paranoid that I'd been bitten by a black spider
00:11:09,00:11:11,in Tasmania.
00:11:11,00:11:13,Pretty sure that I was going to be the next case.
00:11:13,00:11:14,Wow.
00:11:14,00:11:18,What we do a lot on QI is find people with funny deaths.
00:11:18,00:11:19,"And I don't think that's bad, because death"
00:11:19,00:11:21,is just a part of life.
00:11:21,00:11:22,"And you know, we all die."
00:11:22,00:11:25,"And if it can be a funny thing, then that's good."
00:11:25,00:11:28,So you could have been in one of those lists of--
00:11:28,00:11:29,"You could have been a fat, famous death."
00:11:29,00:11:30,You would have liked it.
00:11:30,00:11:32,It would have been announced in the QI office.
00:11:32,00:11:33,"And you would have been like, that's awesome."
00:11:33,00:11:34,That's great.
00:11:34,00:11:35,"But no, my bad."
00:11:35,00:11:37,That's going on a series.
00:11:37,00:11:40,"I almost had a death, which I thought, if it happened,"
00:11:40,00:11:43,it would have made a nice list for you.
00:11:43,00:11:44,"Well, when I was living in Hampstead,"
00:11:44,00:11:46,we got evacuated from our apartment one day
00:11:46,00:11:47,because police were outside.
00:11:47,00:11:48,They didn't even tell us.
00:11:48,00:11:51,"But we went outside, and then they didn't let us back in."
00:11:51,00:11:52,"And I was like, what's going on?"
00:11:52,00:11:54,"And they said, we found in the basement of your flat"
00:11:54,00:11:56,an unexploded World War II bomb.
00:11:56,00:12:00,And so they had people inside detonating the bomb.
00:12:00,00:12:03,But it struck me that had that gone off.
00:12:03,00:12:05,"The person calling my parents, the police officer,"
00:12:05,00:12:07,"would have had to have said, your son's"
00:12:07,00:12:08,met with a tragic accident.
00:12:08,00:12:09,So how do you die?
00:12:09,00:12:11,"Well, he was blown up."
00:12:11,00:12:12,Who did this?
00:12:12,00:12:15,We believe it to be the work of the Nazi.
00:12:15,00:12:18,I would have become a victim of World War II.
00:12:18,00:12:19,I know that's Hitler would have killed him.
00:12:19,00:12:21,I haven't even worse one than that because there
00:12:21,00:12:24,was a Russian psychic in the '80s who
00:12:24,00:12:26,wanted to prove that he was psychic.
00:12:26,00:12:28,And so he stood in front of a moving train
00:12:28,00:12:31,and tried to stop it with his mind and was killed by the train.
00:12:31,00:12:32,"Oh, my God."
00:12:32,00:12:35,"I have one death, which I'd like to share."
00:12:35,00:12:36,"Please, wow."
00:12:36,00:12:39,This is the man who introduced the camel to Australia.
00:12:39,00:12:42,His name is John Ainsworth Horricks.
00:12:42,00:12:44,And he died in 1846.
00:12:44,00:12:46,And he brought the first camels there
00:12:46,00:12:48,because they were used to build the railways.
00:12:48,00:12:50,And the result is now that there
00:12:50,00:12:53,were a million feral camels in Australia.
00:12:53,00:12:55,"But anyway, the man who introduced him, John Ainsworth Horricks,"
00:12:55,00:12:57,was killed by his own camel.
00:12:57,00:12:58,What?
00:12:58,00:12:59,He trampled to death?
00:12:59,00:13:01,"No, he was riding it."
00:13:01,00:13:03,And he was reloading his gun.
00:13:03,00:13:06,It sort of lurched a bit as he did so.
00:13:06,00:13:10,"And the gun went off, blasted him in the arm and in the body."
00:13:10,00:13:13,He lived four days during which he ordered the camel to be shot.
00:13:13,00:13:15,[LAUGHTER]
00:13:15,00:13:18,What a bit in there.
00:13:18,00:13:22,"I looked at him so acne, just because I was so skeptical"
00:13:22,00:13:24,about the idea of acne killing you.
00:13:24,00:13:27,So and then got really caught up in theories about acne
00:13:27,00:13:29,"from the 19th century, what caused it?"
00:13:29,00:13:32,"So for like 150 years, they were referred to as chastity"
00:13:32,00:13:35,postures because it was thought that the reason you had acne
00:13:35,00:13:38,was because you weren't having sex.
00:13:38,00:13:39,And so like doctors wrote--
00:13:39,00:13:43,so I put this quote from a doctor in about 8 to the 1830s--
00:13:43,00:13:45,it is a fact that this affection disappears
00:13:45,00:13:47,in young girls immediately after marriage.
00:13:47,00:13:49,And there is especially seen in young men
00:13:49,00:13:51,who observe rigorous chastity.
00:13:51,00:13:52,"And so they thought, well, so first of all, doctors"
00:13:52,00:13:55,recommend that you marry as soon as possible to get rid of them.
00:13:55,00:13:58,And then they thought another way of like alleviating
00:13:58,00:14:01,it was to give people laxatives.
00:14:01,00:14:03,"Because that I guess, like, I don't know, excels--"
00:14:03,00:14:05,Courage is due in a similar way.
00:14:05,00:14:07,"But weirdly, they do actually work to cure acne."
00:14:07,00:14:09,So they try laxatives and laxatives do work.
00:14:09,00:14:10,OK.
00:14:10,00:14:12,I think I can tell you my acne cleanse.
00:14:12,00:14:15,"Gone from the Greek word ""knayon,"" meaning"
00:14:15,00:14:17,"I know, or I scrape."
00:14:17,00:14:18,"Oh, really?"
00:14:18,00:14:18,Yeah.
00:14:18,00:14:20,I have another cool death here.
00:14:20,00:14:23,This was a guy called Morton Norbury.
00:14:23,00:14:25,"And in 1910, all I know about him is he"
00:14:25,00:14:27,was killed after an argument over who
00:14:27,00:14:29,possessed the most handsome mustache.
00:14:29,00:14:32,[LAUGHTER]
00:14:32,00:14:33,That's such a good death.
00:14:33,00:14:34,That's wonderful.
00:14:34,00:14:34,What's his name?
00:14:34,00:14:35,Morton Norbury?
00:14:35,00:14:36,Morton Norbury.
00:14:36,00:14:36,It's a great name.
00:14:36,00:14:39,He sounds so like a guy with a huge mustache.
00:14:39,00:14:40,I wanted his life.
00:14:40,00:14:42,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:14:42,00:14:47,"OK, time for fact number three."
00:14:47,00:14:48,That is my fact.
00:14:48,00:14:51,"This week, I bought a copy of--"
00:14:51,00:14:53,"there's a new book out called ""This Is Improbable 2"""
00:14:53,00:14:54,by Mark Abrams.
00:14:54,00:14:56,Mark Abrams is the founder of the Ignobile Prizes.
00:14:56,00:14:58,He's also a good kind of QI family friend.
00:14:58,00:14:59,"Yeah, we love him."
00:14:59,00:15:01,We've-- he's been on museumic curiosity.
00:15:01,00:15:04,We often do talks at his Ignobile tours.
00:15:04,00:15:06,One's going to be happening this year.
00:15:06,00:15:08,"Yeah, if you go on to-- if you check out Mark Abram--"
00:15:08,00:15:10,he's at Mark Abram's.
00:15:10,00:15:11,I'll check out mine at X-Shake.
00:15:11,00:15:14,We'll post up when we're going to be appearing in that.
00:15:14,00:15:16,So he's so this book is basically a collection.
00:15:16,00:15:19,He runs as well as the Nobel Prizes
00:15:19,00:15:22,"a magazine, which is called ""The Annals of Improbable Research."""
00:15:22,00:15:25,And it's a kind of a collection of all the greatest research
00:15:25,00:15:27,projects have been undertaken by scientists around the world.
00:15:27,00:15:28,"He collects them, rewrites them."
00:15:28,00:15:30,And so I'm reading the book at the moment.
00:15:30,00:15:33,"And there was one story, which it's not so much a fact,"
00:15:33,00:15:35,but I'd really like the idea of it.
00:15:35,00:15:37,It's all the other notable Einstein's out there.
00:15:37,00:15:39,His point being that it's very hard
00:15:39,00:15:41,"to have the surname Einstein, if he worked in science,"
00:15:41,00:15:46,"because there's quite a famous one who worked in science,"
00:15:46,00:15:48,and he often overshadows the rest of them.
00:15:48,00:15:50,So the most notable ones that are out there
00:15:50,00:15:53,"is Emmy Einstein, who has set an equation"
00:15:53,00:15:57,that predicts the composition of a pork carcass.
00:15:57,00:15:59,"There's also a lady called Rosemary Einstein,"
00:15:59,00:16:02,who she and two other colleagues at the University
00:16:02,00:16:05,of Leeds investigated the use of cannabis and alcohol
00:16:05,00:16:08,and tobacco by 300 young persons at the university.
00:16:08,00:16:11,So these are two people who've published reports
00:16:11,00:16:13,that have been quite successful in the scientific community.
00:16:13,00:16:16,But it did get me thinking about other namesakes.
00:16:16,00:16:21,The other people with incredible shadows to jump over.
00:16:21,00:16:22,And--
00:16:22,00:16:23,"Yeah, it must be hard."
00:16:23,00:16:24,I'll maybe open some doors.
00:16:24,00:16:28,Or maybe it just puts a lot of pressure on you.
00:16:28,00:16:28,I think you're right.
00:16:28,00:16:30,I think it does open doors.
00:16:30,00:16:32,So are there any other old barmas out there at the moment?
00:16:32,00:16:34,"At the moment, not real."
00:16:34,00:16:36,"I mean, there's a prime minister in--"
00:16:36,00:16:39,"I can't remember what country, but he's Obama,"
00:16:39,00:16:40,and he's currently in power.
00:16:40,00:16:40,Really?
00:16:40,00:16:41,"Yeah, wow."
00:16:41,00:16:43,"Yeah, I don't think he's related, but he's--"
00:16:43,00:16:44,I'll see if I can--
00:16:44,00:16:46,"It's not actually Obama, just secretly"
00:16:46,00:16:47,running a thing on the side.
00:16:47,00:16:50,"I have one found in Obama, which I think is--"
00:16:50,00:16:51,"OK, better."
00:16:51,00:16:52,Then the current?
00:16:52,00:16:53,Then the current.
00:16:53,00:16:53,"Yes, Obama."
00:16:53,00:16:54,"Yes, Obama."
00:16:54,00:16:55,No way.
00:16:55,00:16:57,It's the city of Obama in Japan.
00:16:57,00:16:58,"Oh, yes."
00:16:58,00:16:59,Don't say-- come on.
00:16:59,00:17:00,"OK, I'll give you a chance."
00:17:00,00:17:02,"It's got a population of 32,000."
00:17:02,00:17:04,"So already, that's pretty good."
00:17:04,00:17:07,"Imagine they'll be quite productive, and they make 80% of Japan's"
00:17:07,00:17:09,total lack of chopsticks.
00:17:09,00:17:10,"Oh, that is great."
00:17:10,00:17:11,That is great.
00:17:11,00:17:12,Yeah.
00:17:12,00:17:14,So why can't the president say he's done that?
00:17:14,00:17:16,Made 80% of Japan's lack of chopsticks.
00:17:16,00:17:17,He can't.
00:17:17,00:17:21,"He's working two jobs as it is, of course."
00:17:21,00:17:24,"But yeah, I mean, it is one of those things."
00:17:24,00:17:26,"We all have names, so you, James Harkin,"
00:17:26,00:17:27,have a James Harkin do.
00:17:27,00:17:31,"Yeah, there's another James Harkin who writes for the Guardian,"
00:17:31,00:17:33,"I think, or some other newspapers."
00:17:33,00:17:36,And Molly from QI met him at a party once.
00:17:36,00:17:40,"And apparently, he doesn't correct people"
00:17:40,00:17:43,when they think he works for QI.
00:17:43,00:17:47,"And he said, if I ever want to claim any of his articles,"
00:17:47,00:17:49,"which I'm sure are very good, that I can do that as well."
00:17:49,00:17:50,It's nice.
00:17:50,00:17:54,I was going into a co-operative with someone else.
00:17:54,00:17:55,I should do that with the other Andy Murray.
00:17:55,00:17:56,"With the other Andy Murray, yeah."
00:17:56,00:17:58,"I would just do a straight split of everything,"
00:17:58,00:17:59,"you know, the money."
00:17:59,00:18:01,Start-accompanied.
00:18:01,00:18:02,"Or whatever, you know?"
00:18:02,00:18:04,"Andy, is your listening to this now?"
00:18:04,00:18:06,"Just please, please get in touch."
00:18:06,00:18:08,"Well, he needs to listen, because people are coming up,"
00:18:08,00:18:11,"going, hey, great work on the podcast."
00:18:11,00:18:12,"Yeah, thanks, cheers."
00:18:12,00:18:13,Yeah.
00:18:13,00:18:17,"My thing about the etymology of ACME, you know."
00:18:17,00:18:20,"This week, I've been trying to come up"
00:18:20,00:18:21,with some new facts for our books.
00:18:21,00:18:24,"So we did one, three, three, nine QI facts,"
00:18:24,00:18:27,"Albuquerismus, and we're selling it to America."
00:18:27,00:18:29,And we need to come up with some facts at work
00:18:29,00:18:32,for an American audience to replace the ones
00:18:32,00:18:33,that were for a British audience.
00:18:33,00:18:36,And one that I really liked was that the first ever player
00:18:36,00:18:39,drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers NFL team
00:18:39,00:18:41,was called William Shakespeare.
00:18:41,00:18:42,Oh.
00:18:42,00:18:43,Isn't that great?
00:18:43,00:18:43,Yeah.
00:18:43,00:18:44,I really love that.
00:18:44,00:18:45,"And it's great, and it's great as well,"
00:18:45,00:18:48,because you can imagine that any of the journalists
00:18:48,00:18:51,"who really struggle with running out of cliches, basically,"
00:18:51,00:18:52,that's just a gift.
00:18:52,00:18:54,"Like, you suddenly got Shakespeare as a baseball player."
00:18:54,00:18:55,Yeah.
00:18:55,00:18:57,And he's a football player.
00:18:57,00:18:58,And a foul player.
00:18:58,00:18:59,Not so good.
00:18:59,00:19:01,[LAUGHTER]
00:19:01,00:19:02,"Dad, I was drinking baseball."
00:19:02,00:19:03,"Oh, no."
00:19:03,00:19:04,Yeah.
00:19:04,00:19:07,That's what I was doing.
00:19:07,00:19:11,I tried to actually test out the theory of someone who
00:19:11,00:19:15,"was great, like, do my own kind of collection of Einstein's,"
00:19:15,00:19:15,as it were.
00:19:15,00:19:18,So I try to think of the most impressive person alive.
00:19:18,00:19:20,So I picked who I think is sometimes
00:19:20,00:19:22,pitted as the greatest living mind at the moment.
00:19:22,00:19:25,So the actor James Franco--
00:19:25,00:19:28,"James Franco is consistently-- if you read a paper on him,"
00:19:28,00:19:30,treated as some sort of great god of the intellectual--
00:19:30,00:19:32,"for example, this is a quote."
00:19:32,00:19:34,This is someone from an interview.
00:19:34,00:19:37,"He has an unusually high metabolism for productivity,"
00:19:37,00:19:39,a superhuman ability to focus.
00:19:39,00:19:42,"So anytime people write about him, they write about"
00:19:42,00:19:44,with these huge kind of descriptions on.
00:19:44,00:19:45,So check this out.
00:19:45,00:19:48,"OK, OK, OK, I'll justify why people think he's so impressive."
00:19:48,00:19:50,"He's not only an actor, he's an author,"
00:19:50,00:19:52,"he's a director, he's a poet, he's a painter."
00:19:52,00:19:54,"Despite having an acting career, which he's constantly doing,"
00:19:54,00:19:57,he's doing postgraduate courses and got permission
00:19:57,00:20:00,to take as many as 62 course credits per quarter
00:20:00,00:20:04,compared to the normal limit of 19 while continuing to act.
00:20:04,00:20:09,"He has an IQ of 140, which is considered to be a genius level."
00:20:09,00:20:10,"Although, when I was looking into that,"
00:20:10,00:20:11,I know it's a bit.
00:20:11,00:20:15,"It's very dubious, because the graph I saw had Mozart,"
00:20:15,00:20:18,"Beethoven, James Franco, Stephen Hawking."
00:20:18,00:20:20,"No, Shakira."
00:20:20,00:20:23,So it's a bit dubious.
00:20:23,00:20:25,"But so I kind of-- I started thinking, OK,"
00:20:25,00:20:27,that's the best Franco we have.
00:20:27,00:20:28,I want to see what that is.
00:20:28,00:20:29,A lot of my general Franco.
00:20:29,00:20:30,General Franco.
00:20:30,00:20:32,"I mean, is he better than James Franco?"
00:20:32,00:20:33,"Well, did he do more for it?"
00:20:33,00:20:34,Did he do more for it?
00:20:34,00:20:36,He did more.
00:20:36,00:20:39,"Maybe a few of movies, but was in charge of more countries."
00:20:39,00:20:40,"Yeah, I think that's fair."
00:20:40,00:20:42,I did find one other guy who is his name.
00:20:42,00:20:44,He might be a better Franco.
00:20:44,00:20:46,He's called Jesus Franco.
00:20:46,00:20:47,He's a Spanish director.
00:20:47,00:20:49,He was born in 1930.
00:20:49,00:20:52,"Actually, he died late last year, rather sadly."
00:20:52,00:20:54,He made over 180 movies.
00:20:54,00:20:56,So he made a cult movie in 1961 called
00:20:56,00:20:58,The Awful Doctor or Laugh.
00:20:58,00:21:00,But then his career kind of took a side-where extent.
00:21:00,00:21:03,So he made a movie called The Two Female Spies
00:21:03,00:21:05,with Flowered Panties.
00:21:05,00:21:08,A penis for three.
00:21:08,00:21:10,Not a three penis one.
00:21:10,00:21:17,"Night of the Open Virginers, and Lulu's Talking Bunghole."
00:21:17,00:21:19,And he was named by the Catholic Church
00:21:19,00:21:21,as the most dangerous director out there.
00:21:21,00:21:22,So he was called Jesus Franco.
00:21:22,00:21:27,And then Franco's the first name of the first Italian in space.
00:21:27,00:21:28,So we have an astronaut.
00:21:28,00:21:29,You know what that is?
00:21:29,00:21:30,The Jesus guy.
00:21:30,00:21:32,"He was originally called Terence, but as they saw his film,"
00:21:32,00:21:34,"they kept saying, ""Jesus Franco."""
00:21:34,00:21:36,God's sake.
00:21:36,00:21:40,But I think it's interesting.
00:21:40,00:21:42,"That's suddenly, you know, take one name, Franco."
00:21:42,00:21:44,And he's talking Bunghole.
00:21:44,00:21:45,Lulu's.
00:21:45,00:21:46,Lulu's.
00:21:46,00:21:47,Sorry.
00:21:47,00:21:48,Night of the Open Virginers.
00:21:48,00:21:50,I don't even know what that means.
00:21:50,00:21:52,Is it like neither the living dead?
00:21:52,00:21:53,Yeah.
00:21:53,00:21:54,I don't know.
00:21:54,00:21:55,It's a zombie vagina work.
00:21:55,00:21:56,The Earth of Night.
00:21:56,00:21:57,Yeah.
00:21:57,00:22:00,"Well, did you know that used to be the theory about vaginas?"
00:22:00,00:22:01,They moved around the body.
00:22:01,00:22:02,No.
00:22:02,00:22:04,They would disappear into the middle of the night to go get food.
00:22:04,00:22:05,What?
00:22:05,00:22:06,Yeah.
00:22:06,00:22:08,I read a book called It Should Be Here.
00:22:08,00:22:09,It should be here.
00:22:09,00:22:10,It should be here.
00:22:10,00:22:12,It was called The Story of B.
00:22:12,00:22:15,"And it was all about vaginas, the history of vaginas."
00:22:15,00:22:16,Okay.
00:22:16,00:22:17,History of vaginas.
00:22:17,00:22:18,The first notable vagina.
00:22:18,00:22:31,The best thing I'm sorry about people's names is I went on to Facebook and NPR had done
00:22:31,00:22:36,"this post on Facebook saying, do you have a name which is similar to someone famous?"
00:22:36,00:22:38,"If so, how is it affected your life?"
00:22:38,00:22:41,And there are 1100 comments on that.
00:22:41,00:22:43,I read through them all.
00:22:43,00:22:48,"But there was a girl called Sharon Stone who said, if I had a book for every time"
00:22:48,00:22:50,"someone said, are you wearing panties?"
00:22:50,00:22:52,I'd be as rich as the actress.
00:22:52,00:22:53,"Oh, a book."
00:22:53,00:22:54,I think so in a book.
00:22:54,00:22:56,I have a book for every time.
00:22:56,00:23:01,I'd be able to have a very successful secondhand bookshop.
00:23:01,00:23:06,"And there was a guy called Dave Apps, who had to get a special permission from Facebook"
00:23:06,00:23:08,to have an account because his name was Apps.
00:23:08,00:23:09,Oh.
00:23:09,00:23:11,"Yeah, which is pretty good."
00:23:11,00:23:14,And there's also a guy called Nicholas Dragon.
00:23:14,00:23:17,"And he said, I don't think there's anyone famous with my name."
00:23:17,00:23:20,"So anytime I meet someone new, they say, wow, that's a cool name."
00:23:20,00:23:24,"And a cool story, Nicholas."
00:23:24,00:23:27,You're not wrong.
00:23:27,00:23:30,Did you guys know that Samuel Johnson?
00:23:30,00:23:32,"I know we've got, so we found one."
00:23:32,00:23:33,We found the other.
00:23:33,00:23:34,We found the other Samuel Johnson.
00:23:34,00:23:35,"But actually, there was a third time."
00:23:35,00:23:36,So can you give a repeat of what?
00:23:36,00:23:37,"Yeah, of course."
00:23:37,00:23:41,So one of the other QI researchers found that there was another Samuel Johnson alive at
00:23:41,00:23:45,"the same time as Samuel Johnson, you know, the guy who wrote the dictionary, who was"
00:23:45,00:23:50,"a dramatist and entertainer performer, who was also known as Lord Flame."
00:23:50,00:23:52,"That's a great name, that is."
00:23:52,00:23:53,Yeah.
00:23:53,00:23:57,"But there was a third Samuel Johnson, who, so Samuel Johnson, the one we know about the"
00:23:57,00:24:01,"dictionary man, was asked to do a translation of this great work by Frau Paolo."
00:24:01,00:24:04,"I can't remember what it's called, but anyway, it was this great historical work."
00:24:04,00:24:05,It was big cheese at the time.
00:24:05,00:24:07,It was like the Harry Potter of its day.
00:24:07,00:24:10,"And so Samuel Johnson was like, yeah, I'll do that."
00:24:10,00:24:11,Started translating it.
00:24:11,00:24:15,"Then found out that they'd also asked another guy, also called Samuel Johnson, to"
00:24:15,00:24:16,do it.
00:24:16,00:24:17,And so he kind of was fronted.
00:24:17,00:24:20,"He was like, not only has someone else been asked to do it, but it's someone else called"
00:24:20,00:24:21,Samuel Johnson.
00:24:21,00:24:24,"And then there's this series of exchanges and newspapers, where Samuel Johnson won, is"
00:24:24,00:24:26,getting really angry with Samuel Johnson too.
00:24:26,00:24:28,"And eventually, noise of them translated the work."
00:24:28,00:24:31,"They just got this big skirmish, and they both went, well, I'll sort it then."
00:24:31,00:24:32,"Fine, I'm not doing it."
00:24:32,00:24:34,And then Lord Flame came along with him.
00:24:34,00:24:35,Hi.
00:24:35,00:24:36,Watch me do it somehow.
00:24:36,00:24:42,"Oh, don't do a translation."
00:24:42,00:24:50,Let's move on to our final fact.
00:24:50,00:24:51,"Andy, what's going to you?"
00:24:51,00:24:52,Yes.
00:24:52,00:24:53,Okay.
00:24:53,00:24:58,"The fact is, the first contact lenses cost as much as a car."
00:24:58,00:24:59,Wow.
00:24:59,00:25:00,What year was it?
00:25:00,00:25:03,"Well, they were invented in Germany in the late 1880s, originally, and Britain was a"
00:25:03,00:25:04,bit late to it.
00:25:04,00:25:05,That was in the 1930s.
00:25:05,00:25:09,"But even in the 20s and 30s in Britain, so even though they'd been around in benefit"
00:25:09,00:25:11,"50 years, they were still that expensive."
00:25:11,00:25:12,Wow.
00:25:12,00:25:15,"So, they weren't presumably things that you would change every day."
00:25:15,00:25:16,"No, no, no."
00:25:16,00:25:19,"These were hard contact lenses, proper sort of shell like ones, and they were very thick"
00:25:19,00:25:20,as well.
00:25:20,00:25:23,So they could only be one for two hours max at a time.
00:25:23,00:25:24,Wow.
00:25:24,00:25:27,And then the irritation in your eye was so great that you had to take them out.
00:25:27,00:25:30,"And initially, you had to have a mold taken of your eye."
00:25:30,00:25:33,"There are great videos, if you look up on British Pathay news."
00:25:33,00:25:36,There are photos of people's eyelids being pulled apart.
00:25:36,00:25:38,There's big mold being stuck in their eye.
00:25:38,00:25:43,"And they're sort of the promotional videos and the lady's saying, look, you look at how"
00:25:43,00:25:44,nice my eyes look.
00:25:44,00:25:46,"Now, I don't have to wear spectacles."
00:25:46,00:25:47,"And she's in the horizon, watery."
00:25:47,00:25:51,"It's really a great, little vein, it's really a great pain."
00:25:51,00:25:53,Of the margins of the gun to her head.
00:25:53,00:25:56,I just don't know if she's such clever and easy.
00:25:56,00:25:57,Wow.
00:25:57,00:25:58,It's really funny.
00:25:58,00:26:00,You should look them up if you're listening.
00:26:00,00:26:01,Maybe you could post it on your tablet.
00:26:01,00:26:02,"Yeah, as well."
00:26:02,00:26:06,"I'll put it on my Twitter, which is @AndrewHunterM, and you'll be able to see."
00:26:06,00:26:08,"So, yeah, that was the first contact lenses."
00:26:08,00:26:11,"Well, you actually found this out because you went to a museum, didn't you?"
00:26:11,00:26:17,"I went to the Museum of the British Optical Association, or British Optanvological Association."
00:26:17,00:26:20,"I didn't remember the name of it, but I did go to it."
00:26:20,00:26:22,It's in Sharon Cross.
00:26:22,00:26:23,It's great.
00:26:23,00:26:24,"Just on the same street, five doors apart."
00:26:24,00:26:28,There's Benjamin Franklin's house from when he lived here.
00:26:28,00:26:29,And this amazing museum.
00:26:29,00:26:31,But you can only go around it by appointment.
00:26:31,00:26:35,"So you have to email the curator and say, I'd like to see all your cool stuff."
00:26:35,00:26:36,And there's so much amazing stuff there.
00:26:36,00:26:41,"So not only that, the first ever soft contact lenses are much thinner and more comfortable."
00:26:41,00:26:44,"You had to, they came in a glass tube and to get access to the lenses, you had to break"
00:26:44,00:26:45,hope in the glass tube.
00:26:45,00:26:47,So there are now shards of glass.
00:26:47,00:26:48,And you're not.
00:26:48,00:26:50,And there are your contact lenses.
00:26:50,00:26:56,"The first I'm promoting them with just crying blood, so I'm not afraid of them."
00:26:56,00:27:02,They were invented not to help you see.
00:27:02,00:27:06,"They were invented to shield people's eyes, because there's a medical condition called"
00:27:06,00:27:07,carocotonous.
00:27:07,00:27:08,Carocotonous?
00:27:08,00:27:11,But very close.
00:27:11,00:27:12,It's called carocotonous.
00:27:12,00:27:15,"And it means you have a very, very sensitive, it's the core near, or is it at the front of"
00:27:15,00:27:16,the eye?
00:27:16,00:27:17,Yeah.
00:27:17,00:27:19,And it also becomes pointed.
00:27:19,00:27:23,And so they were invented to help people discover their lives without the intense pain
00:27:23,00:27:24,and irritation.
00:27:24,00:27:25,Yeah.
00:27:25,00:27:29,They were initially a medical thing in that sense rather than an eye second.
00:27:29,00:27:30,Yeah.
00:27:30,00:27:34,Did you guys know that Abraham Lincoln's contact lenses were made of wood?
00:27:34,00:27:36,That's just not true.
00:27:36,00:27:37,That's just not true.
00:27:37,00:27:38,No.
00:27:38,00:27:39,It's not.
00:27:39,00:27:40,I'm sorry.
00:27:40,00:27:41,"You see, you see, you see."
00:27:41,00:27:51,I read about supposedly René Descartes made some contact lenses that were made out of
00:27:51,00:27:56,"what they were fluid inside that would magnify things, but they stuck so far out of your"
00:27:56,00:27:59,eye that you couldn't blink when you had them in contact.
00:27:59,00:28:00,Wow.
00:28:00,00:28:01,That's great.
00:28:01,00:28:02,That's great.
00:28:02,00:28:09,"I tell you about that, the early snow goggles were made out of caribou antler, weren't they?"
00:28:09,00:28:10,Really?
00:28:10,00:28:11,Yeah.
00:28:11,00:28:12,And they weren't see-through.
00:28:12,00:28:16,They just had a very small slit that you would be able to see through and it would protect
00:28:16,00:28:17,your eyes when you were skiing.
00:28:17,00:28:18,That was great.
00:28:18,00:28:19,I guess that would work.
00:28:19,00:28:24,"I was surprised to read that 64% of people, supposedly, it's an estimate where glasses."
00:28:24,00:28:25,Have you got contacts?
00:28:25,00:28:26,"Yeah, yeah."
00:28:26,00:28:27,I've got them in now.
00:28:27,00:28:28,"Well, you wear contacts?"
00:28:28,00:28:29,Yeah.
00:28:29,00:28:30,Of course you've made them.
00:28:30,00:28:41,You're okay with that loan off.
00:28:41,00:28:42,Okay.
00:28:42,00:28:43,That's it for this week's episode.
00:28:43,00:28:44,That's all of our facts.
00:28:44,00:28:45,"Thanks so much, everyone, for listening."
