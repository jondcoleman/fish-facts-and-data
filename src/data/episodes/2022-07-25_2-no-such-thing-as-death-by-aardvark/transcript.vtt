WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680
 We run it on QI a few years ago.

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.200
 Yeah.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.360
 Um, which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.720
 You didn't know such thing as a fish.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.920
 No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.560
 He says it right there, first paragraph.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.720
 No such thing as a fish.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.880
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:24.360
 Oh, and welcome to the second episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish."

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.600
 This is a QIELF podcast coming to you from our office

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.040
 is in Covenant Garden.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.680
 We want to say, first of all, thanks to everyone who

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.320
 listened to the first episode that we put out last week.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.920
 Got huge numbers.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:35.920
 We weren't expecting it.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.440
 And really great feedback.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.120
 There's a lot of technical hiccups that we are sorting out.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.200
 We're going to get on with this second podcast now.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.440
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.080
 I am sitting here with three other QIELs--

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.000
 James Harkin and H. Azinsky and Andy Murray.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.240
 And once again, we're huddled around our microphone.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.560
 And these are the best facts that we found out

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.920
 from the last seven days.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.880
 So in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.120
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.080
 OK, first fact.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.720
 And let's go with you, Anna.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.360
 Yeah, I found out this week that the first ever sandwich

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.960
 that we know about contained wine.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.480
 Yeah, but it was a wine sandwich.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.080
 What?

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.880
 Well, it is.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.720
 It's a sandwich.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.560
 I think it's a bread with wine.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.520
 We had had other stuff in it, but wine was one of the ingredients.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.200
 Yeah, so the first recorded sandwich was actually more of a wrap.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.360
 It was called a correction.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.480
 It was invented by Hillel, who's a Jewish religious leader from,

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.920
 like, 100 BC.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.800
 So the Jews have been, like, at this festival eating wine

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.080
 and figs and spices and stuff all mixed up together for about 1,000 years.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.560
 And he decided to just shove it between some flatbread.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.120
 And part of the concoction was wine and mixed up--

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.960
 So this isn't the Earl of Sandwich's invention.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.800
 I'm doing the inverted colors side there,

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.600
 and I say that.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.200
 So this is way before that.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.800
 This is way before that.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.560
 The Earl of Sandwich claims credit where it's not G.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.760
 Yeah, I never heard that.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.600
 And that's actually-- I don't think we've

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.240
 done that genig on QI who invented the sandwich, have we?

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.280
 No, but what did the other sandwich do, if anything?

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.880
 I think he was the first person to--

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.200
 I mean, he probably wasn't, but he was known for shoving meat

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.600
 between bread and the West.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.840
 People say it's because he was a, like, a gracious gambler, yeah.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.080
 Well, there's no way that he invented the sandwich anyway,

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.120
 is that because, like, obviously, for, like you say,

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.240
 for ever, people have been putting things in between two slices of meat.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.160
 Yeah, it's so obvious.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.040
 I think I'd like this idea of people just putting their name to something

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.600
 which has been invented for so long.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.640
 Like, in 1999 in Japan, someone patented curry.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.320
 Wow.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.800
 Yeah.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.520
 What happened was the very next year, 80 people

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.880
 tried to patent pizza after this, huh?

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:37.960
 Really, yeah.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.600
 Well, there was a guy in Australia who successfully

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.480
 painted in the wheel, right?

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.080
 Oh, yeah.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.040
 Successfully?

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.200
 Yeah, successfully.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.200
 But that was actually the first wheel in Australia.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.760
 It was just 20 years ago.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.880
 [LAUGHTER]

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.400
 Yeah, he did.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.400
 He successfully did it.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.280
 And it made it past.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.080
 And he did it as a kind of parody protest

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.320
 to show how things were getting through the net when it came to patents.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.840
 Oh, thank you.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.880
 Because I think to a lot of people getting stuff stolen in Australia

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:06.840
 as an invention.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:07.720
 And so--

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.220
 OK.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.720
 Yeah, he successfully did it.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.240
 I remember the guy in the '70s who patented the colmover.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.240
 Oh, yeah.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.520
 Obviously that's been happening forever, but yeah, yeah.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.440
 This is from the Wikipedia about the sandwich full disclosure.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.800
 But what it says is, before being known as sandwiches,

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.640
 this food combination seems to simply

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.560
 have been known as bread and meat.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.920
 [LAUGHTER]

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:31.920
 Or meat and bread.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.160
 Or meat and bread, cheese.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.200
 [LAUGHTER]

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.440
 Hang on, I just thought that would work for all fillings.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.940
 Yeah.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.040
 You just bread and--

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.760
 Yeah, bread and cheese and bread and cheese.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.520
 Yeah.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.800
 I'm just going to go and have a cheese and ham, bread and cheese and ham.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.760
 [LAUGHTER]

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.120
 I was thinking about-- because the idea of wine going into a sandwich

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.920
 is it's a nice thing about what else goes into a sandwich

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:57.920
 that you would not expect.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.880
 But then I started thinking, oh, but there's a lot of stuff

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.400
 that goes into wine that we don't expect.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.900
 OK.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.160
 But there's a nettle wine.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.160
 So nettle being those stingy knives.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.280
 Yeah, so you can get nettle.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.720
 That's a cannabis wine, which is available,

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.640
 which has become really popular in the US.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.600
 This is my favorite one.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.040
 It's a chilean wine.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.160
 And it's been created using meaty right

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.440
 for them during the birth of a solar system.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.280
 What?

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.480
 Yeah, so it's a-- it's been developed by a guy called Ian Hutchin.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.320
 He's an English guy working in Chile.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.640
 It's a meteorite that's believed to have

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.200
 crashed in the Atacama desert in northern Chile,

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.000
 about 6,000 years ago.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.920
 And it's submerged in the wine during the fermentation process.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.760
 Yeah, so it's a meaty right wine.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:38.440
 I mean, that's--

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.680
 Well, that's pretty cool.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.140
 Yeah, I really want to tell you that.

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.800
 In China, you can get something called three penis wine.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.920
 Can you guess what's in that?

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.040
 Two penises.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.640
 No, three penises.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.160
 It does contain three different penises.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.160
 Of what?

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.400
 OK, so deer.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.560
 Yeah, deer is one of them.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.400
 And it's supposed to be like a general pick me up kind of.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.120
 But deer, maybe a bird?

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.240
 One of the birds with a penis?

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.040
 Yeah, most birds don't have penises today.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.720
 97% of bird species have no penises.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.440
 But the other three, some of them

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.360
 have very, very positive players.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.120
 Yeah.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.400
 The Argentinian lake dot.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.280
 45 centimeters and curled.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.680
 And that's just a blu-tit.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.080
 If you're listening to this at home,

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.440
 Google Argentinian lake dot penis.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.240
 And you'll see exactly what Andy's talking about.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.120
 It is epic.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.880
 Wow.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.320
 Well, what's the third penis?

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.480
 I can't remember.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.200
 History penis.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.200
 History penis.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.040
 History.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.080
 Lucky did penis.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.200
 Penis du jour.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.680
 There is one other wine.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.960
 It's a Japanese wine, which is called Japanese feces wine.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.200
 It's no-dose tongsul.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.400
 And it's primarily made using human or animal feces.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.120
 So what's the third kind of feces?

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.360
 I'm going to give you one.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.240
 I'm going to trump that even for a disgusting wine.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.400
 In 1495, it was reported that the Spanish

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.440
 were mixing the blood of lepers with their wine

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.520
 and feeding it to the French as a only kind of biological

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.280
 warfare.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.840
 Well, they're war at the time.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:16.880
 It wasn't a preemptive.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.280
 OK.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.480
 No, sorry, leper war.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.600
 Lepper's blood.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.440
 But it probably wouldn't have done any harm.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.040
 No.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:28.200
 Because 90% of people, 95, are immune to Hansen's disease.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.000
 Hansen's disease are leprosy anyway.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.200
 And a lot of people will probably

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.160
 misidentifying leprosy even then as other skin conditions.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.920
 I'd really like to quickly say a word

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.000
 for about the Earl of Sandwich, because I love him.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.440
 It's actually the current Earl of Sandwich.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.720
 I wanted to mention the 11th Earl of Sandwich,

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.280
 who's direct descendant of the Earl of Sandwich, because he--

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.840
 so he's obviously thought, I'm the Earl of Sandwich.

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.640
 And I've got this son called Orlando.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.880
 So he's got Orlando who's going to be the Earl of Sandwich.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.760
 So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go and set up

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.400
 a sandwich shop and go into business with this guy called

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.600
 Robert Earl, and it's going to be in Orlando.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:03.520
 And so that's what he did.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.520
 So the current Earl of Sandwich owns the sandwich shop

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.000
 in Disneyland, Orlando.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.760
 Called Orlando Blumas.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.560
 It should be.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.400
 It should be.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.720
 It's called the Earl of Sandwich.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.680
 The good thing about the Disneyland in Tokyo,

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.080
 you'll know this better than me, Andy,

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:23.480
 but didn't the not one of the North Korean Kim Jong, you know, this guy?

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.560
 One of Kim Jong Il's three sons was disinherited

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.840
 for going to one of the Disneyland's.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:29.360
 Really?

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.200
 Yeah, right?

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.400
 He had three sons, and the first two botched it.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.000
 And I can't remember how the other one did,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.440
 but Kim Jong Nam is the eldest son of Kim Jong Il.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:44.120
 And he was detained in Japan with a fraudulent passport in 2001.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.600
 He was trying to pass himself off as a Dominican named

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:51.640
 Pang Xiong, which translates as Fat Bear in Chinese.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.400
 And so they deported him.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:57.640
 But he was trying to visit Tokyo, Disneyland, with his family.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.280
 I got told the other day that who is this?

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.440
 Someone I know went to South Korea,

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.800
 and they stood at the border of South Korea and North Korea.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.240
 And apparently what you see when you're at the South looking at the North

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.200
 is a huge cardboard cutout of a city

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.680
 that North Korea has put up to give the impression

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.760
 that they're a huge metropolis from South Korea.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.800
 Oh, OK, they call them Potemkin towns, don't they?

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.840
 Yeah, but it's just, it's like, literally like,

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.800
 imagine the Hollywood sign, but done as a ginormous looking city.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.440
 So that's what you see when you--

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.480
 What happens when it rains?

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.840
 What's made of, like, I'm sure they laminated it, for some reason.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.440
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.560
 What's the--

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:37.240
 There isn't an extra area at the border where they both work.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.040
 That was where there were a lot of recent tension.

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:42.000
 And they shut down called the Kaisom industrial area.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.680
 And actually workers from both countries

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:46.200
 go into it every day, thousands of them work together.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.920
 So there's this one weird point of contact

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.800
 between the two countries.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.920
 What my favorite fact about that part of the world

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.880
 is it's called the demilitarized zone, isn't it?

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:55.400
 Yes.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.600
 But it's the world's most militarized zone.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.000
 Yeah, that's it.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.560
 That's all right, isn't it?

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.480
 Why isn't that the one in the house that it's on?

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.080
 I can't say.

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.880
 I missed out on so many opportunities.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:06.960
 Didn't scan.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.120
 [LAUGHTER]

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.240
 We should have been written QI version.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.000
 I don't know.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.200
 I'll land it as more as that.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:17.800
 OK, let's move on to fact two.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.400
 James, this is your effect.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:20.520
 Yeah, I like this one.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:25.400
 It's in 2003, three people in Mexico died of acne.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:26.200
 So--

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:26.960
 I love that.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.960
 I'm pretty sure you can't die of acne.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:29.960
 I know.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:30.920
 I don't know how they died.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:34.240
 This just came from a list of the ways that people died.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.600
 So it's on nationmaster.com.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.920
 And it gives all of the mortality stats

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.600
 for all the different countries.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.320
 And so if you looked for people dying of acne,

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:47.120
 there were seven deaths worldwide, three of which

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.600
 occurred in Mexico.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.240
 And what I think it is, it's just the way

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.720
 that they do their stats.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.120
 And other countries might have people dying of the same thing,

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.640
 but they don't say it's a vaccine.

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.000
 So they just died with acne?

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.400
 Yeah.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.960
 Let's just say it's that.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:02.960
 Because I can see that.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.080
 And I don't have to cut a movie.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.720
 It looks to me like you died of being a five foot six male.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.720
 Yeah.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.680
 Yeah, maybe they just, they have to write--

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.520
 they have to tick a box of what they died with and the acne

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.280
 is right at the very top.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:16.200
 And they just lay eyes.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:20.040
 The first answer was, yeah, it's an ailment right at the top.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.000
 Is it on Varka, does he?

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:21.600
 No.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.680
 So yeah, it's going to be--

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:24.200
 It could be killed by an arid vark.

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:24.720
 Yeah.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:25.480
 Death.

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.760
 They don't have a list of people who were killed by animals.

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:34.640
 27 worldwide in 2003, people killed by contact with millipedes,

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:35.400
 which is pretty cool.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.400
 Poisonous millipedes?

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.920
 Or, yeah, venomous ones.

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.800
 And I think five of those were in El Salvador.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.760
 I seem to remember you telling me ages ago

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:46.280
 that in Australia, no one's died of this.

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.160
 And no one's ever died in Australia.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.160
 It's really interesting.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:49.680
 Yeah.

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.120
 But we don't have acne in Australia.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.200
 So no, it's not.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.920
 But no one's been by spider or snake

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.760
 has died in the last 50 years.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.840
 It's certainly been a long time since a spider bite killed anyone

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.720
 because they have very good antivenom, though, in Australia.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.440
 I think it was the 1980s.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.520
 And I just remember looking this up,

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.520
 because I got paranoid that I'd been bitten by a black spider

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.680
 in Tasmania.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.680
 Pretty sure that I was going to be the next case.

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:14.440
 Wow.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:18.040
 What we do a lot on QI is find people with funny deaths.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.720
 And I don't think that's bad, because death

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.640
 is just a part of life.

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:22.720
 And you know, we all die.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.520
 And if it can be a funny thing, then that's good.

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:28.440
 So you could have been in one of those lists of--

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:29.840
 You could have been a fat, famous death.

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:30.800
 You would have liked it.

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.240
 It would have been announced in the QI office.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.840
 And you would have been like, that's awesome.

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:34.360
 That's great.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.040
 But no, my bad.

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.000
 That's going on a series.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.520
 I almost had a death, which I thought, if it happened,

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:43.000
 it would have made a nice list for you.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.440
 Well, when I was living in Hampstead,

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:46.640
 we got evacuated from our apartment one day

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:47.920
 because police were outside.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:48.760
 They didn't even tell us.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:51.200
 But we went outside, and then they didn't let us back in.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.120
 And I was like, what's going on?

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:54.320
 And they said, we found in the basement of your flat

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.680
 an unexploded World War II bomb.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:00.200
 And so they had people inside detonating the bomb.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:03.120
 But it struck me that had that gone off.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.440
 The person calling my parents, the police officer,

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.320
 would have had to have said, your son's

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.680
 met with a tragic accident.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:09.800
 So how do you die?

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.440
 Well, he was blown up.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.840
 Who did this?

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.600
 We believe it to be the work of the Nazi.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.160
 I would have become a victim of World War II.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.760
 I know that's Hitler would have killed him.

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.520
 I haven't even worse one than that because there

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:24.080
 was a Russian psychic in the '80s who

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.200
 wanted to prove that he was psychic.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.440
 And so he stood in front of a moving train

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:31.960
 and tried to stop it with his mind and was killed by the train.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:32.760
 Oh, my God.

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.640
 I have one death, which I'd like to share.

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:36.360
 Please, wow.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:39.920
 This is the man who introduced the camel to Australia.

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:42.560
 His name is John Ainsworth Horricks.

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.720
 And he died in 1846.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.640
 And he brought the first camels there

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.480
 because they were used to build the railways.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.600
 And the result is now that there

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:53.120
 were a million feral camels in Australia.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.280
 But anyway, the man who introduced him, John Ainsworth Horricks,

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:57.680
 was killed by his own camel.

00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:58.680
 What?

00:12:58.680 --> 00:12:59.840
 He trampled to death?

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.160
 No, he was riding it.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.480
 And he was reloading his gun.

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:06.800
 It sort of lurched a bit as he did so.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:10.840
 And the gun went off, blasted him in the arm and in the body.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.600
 He lived four days during which he ordered the camel to be shot.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.960
 [LAUGHTER]

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.840
 What a bit in there.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:22.160
 I looked at him so acne, just because I was so skeptical

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.360
 about the idea of acne killing you.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:27.800
 So and then got really caught up in theories about acne

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:29.400
 from the 19th century, what caused it?

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:32.400
 So for like 150 years, they were referred to as chastity

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.960
 postures because it was thought that the reason you had acne

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:38.280
 was because you weren't having sex.

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.880
 And so like doctors wrote--

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:43.680
 so I put this quote from a doctor in about 8 to the 1830s--

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.680
 it is a fact that this affection disappears

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:47.520
 in young girls immediately after marriage.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:49.080
 And there is especially seen in young men

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.160
 who observe rigorous chastity.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.920
 And so they thought, well, so first of all, doctors

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:55.840
 recommend that you marry as soon as possible to get rid of them.

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.920
 And then they thought another way of like alleviating

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.400
 it was to give people laxatives.

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.760
 Because that I guess, like, I don't know, excels--

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.360
 Courage is due in a similar way.

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.520
 But weirdly, they do actually work to cure acne.

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.640
 So they try laxatives and laxatives do work.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:10.160
 OK.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.320
 I think I can tell you my acne cleanse.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:15.040
 Gone from the Greek word "knayon," meaning

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:17.520
 I know, or I scrape.

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:18.120
 Oh, really?

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:18.640
 Yeah.

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:20.000
 I have another cool death here.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.160
 This was a guy called Morton Norbury.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.600
 And in 1910, all I know about him is he

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.600
 was killed after an argument over who

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.720
 possessed the most handsome mustache.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:32.280
 [LAUGHTER]

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:33.640
 That's such a good death.

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:34.440
 That's wonderful.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:34.800
 What's his name?

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:35.480
 Morton Norbury?

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.280
 Morton Norbury.

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:36.920
 It's a great name.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:39.080
 He sounds so like a guy with a huge mustache.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.160
 I wanted his life.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.720
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:47.960
 OK, time for fact number three.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:48.800
 That is my fact.

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.040
 This week, I bought a copy of--

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.200
 there's a new book out called "This Is Improbable 2"

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.160
 by Mark Abrams.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.720
 Mark Abrams is the founder of the Ignobile Prizes.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.600
 He's also a good kind of QI family friend.

00:14:58.600 --> 00:14:59.680
 Yeah, we love him.

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.480
 We've-- he's been on museumic curiosity.

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:04.600
 We often do talks at his Ignobile tours.

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.040
 One's going to be happening this year.

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.920
 Yeah, if you go on to-- if you check out Mark Abram--

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:10.280
 he's at Mark Abram's.

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.800
 I'll check out mine at X-Shake.

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:14.640
 We'll post up when we're going to be appearing in that.

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.960
 So he's so this book is basically a collection.

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:19.420
 He runs as well as the Nobel Prizes

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:22.360
 a magazine, which is called "The Annals of Improbable Research."

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.200
 And it's a kind of a collection of all the greatest research

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.520
 projects have been undertaken by scientists around the world.

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:28.840
 He collects them, rewrites them.

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:30.520
 And so I'm reading the book at the moment.

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:33.400
 And there was one story, which it's not so much a fact,

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.000
 but I'd really like the idea of it.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.520
 It's all the other notable Einstein's out there.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.360
 His point being that it's very hard

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.880
 to have the surname Einstein, if he worked in science,

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:46.080
 because there's quite a famous one who worked in science,

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:48.480
 and he often overshadows the rest of them.

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.480
 So the most notable ones that are out there

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:53.880
 is Emmy Einstein, who has set an equation

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:57.000
 that predicts the composition of a pork carcass.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.800
 There's also a lady called Rosemary Einstein,

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.680
 who she and two other colleagues at the University

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:05.920
 of Leeds investigated the use of cannabis and alcohol

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.880
 and tobacco by 300 young persons at the university.

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:11.320
 So these are two people who've published reports

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.760
 that have been quite successful in the scientific community.

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.440
 But it did get me thinking about other namesakes.

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:21.360
 The other people with incredible shadows to jump over.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.160
 And--

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.160
 Yeah, it must be hard.

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:24.920
 I'll maybe open some doors.

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:28.360
 Or maybe it just puts a lot of pressure on you.

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:28.920
 I think you're right.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.120
 I think it does open doors.

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.960
 So are there any other old barmas out there at the moment?

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:34.120
 At the moment, not real.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.600
 I mean, there's a prime minister in--

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.000
 I can't remember what country, but he's Obama,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.040
 and he's currently in power.

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:40.560
 Really?

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:41.440
 Yeah, wow.

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.880
 Yeah, I don't think he's related, but he's--

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:44.720
 I'll see if I can--

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.040
 It's not actually Obama, just secretly

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.440
 running a thing on the side.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:50.120
 I have one found in Obama, which I think is--

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:51.840
 OK, better.

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:52.640
 Then the current?

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:53.320
 Then the current.

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:53.840
 Yes, Obama.

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:54.840
 Yes, Obama.

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:55.680
 No way.

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:57.800
 It's the city of Obama in Japan.

00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:58.640
 Oh, yes.

00:16:58.640 --> 00:16:59.680
 Don't say-- come on.

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:00.760
 OK, I'll give you a chance.

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:02.840
 It's got a population of 32,000.

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.160
 So already, that's pretty good.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.120
 Imagine they'll be quite productive, and they make 80% of Japan's

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:09.680
 total lack of chopsticks.

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:10.640
 Oh, that is great.

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:11.560
 That is great.

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:12.080
 Yeah.

00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:14.440
 So why can't the president say he's done that?

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.720
 Made 80% of Japan's lack of chopsticks.

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:17.640
 He can't.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:21.680
 He's working two jobs as it is, of course.

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:24.360
 But yeah, I mean, it is one of those things.

00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:26.680
 We all have names, so you, James Harkin,

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:27.720
 have a James Harkin do.

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:31.120
 Yeah, there's another James Harkin who writes for the Guardian,

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.320
 I think, or some other newspapers.

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:36.640
 And Molly from QI met him at a party once.

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:40.360
 And apparently, he doesn't correct people

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:43.960
 when they think he works for QI.

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:47.560
 And he said, if I ever want to claim any of his articles,

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:49.880
 which I'm sure are very good, that I can do that as well.

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:50.680
 It's nice.

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:54.040
 I was going into a co-operative with someone else.

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.720
 I should do that with the other Andy Murray.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:56.800
 With the other Andy Murray, yeah.

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:58.640
 I would just do a straight split of everything,

00:17:58.640 --> 00:17:59.640
 you know, the money.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.160
 Start-accompanied.

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:02.440
 Or whatever, you know?

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:04.320
 Andy, is your listening to this now?

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.720
 Just please, please get in touch.

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.720
 Well, he needs to listen, because people are coming up,

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:11.160
 going, hey, great work on the podcast.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.520
 Yeah, thanks, cheers.

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:13.480
 Yeah.

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:17.640
 My thing about the etymology of ACME, you know.

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:20.080
 This week, I've been trying to come up

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:21.680
 with some new facts for our books.

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.440
 So we did one, three, three, nine QI facts,

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.760
 Albuquerismus, and we're selling it to America.

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:29.600
 And we need to come up with some facts at work

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:32.000
 for an American audience to replace the ones

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.760
 that were for a British audience.

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:36.280
 And one that I really liked was that the first ever player

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:39.480
 drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers NFL team

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:41.200
 was called William Shakespeare.

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.200
 Oh.

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.040
 Isn't that great?

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:43.880
 Yeah.

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:44.880
 I really love that.

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:45.880
 And it's great, and it's great as well,

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:48.240
 because you can imagine that any of the journalists

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:51.520
 who really struggle with running out of cliches, basically,

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:52.640
 that's just a gift.

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.760
 Like, you suddenly got Shakespeare as a baseball player.

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:55.760
 Yeah.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.120
 And he's a football player.

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.840
 And a foul player.

00:18:58.840 --> 00:18:59.880
 Not so good.

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.320
 [LAUGHTER]

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:02.640
 Dad, I was drinking baseball.

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:03.840
 Oh, no.

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:04.840
 Yeah.

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:07.640
 That's what I was doing.

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:11.160
 I tried to actually test out the theory of someone who

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:15.000
 was great, like, do my own kind of collection of Einstein's,

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:15.520
 as it were.

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:18.240
 So I try to think of the most impressive person alive.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.280
 So I picked who I think is sometimes

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:22.720
 pitted as the greatest living mind at the moment.

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.000
 So the actor James Franco--

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.120
 James Franco is consistently-- if you read a paper on him,

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:30.960
 treated as some sort of great god of the intellectual--

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:32.280
 for example, this is a quote.

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.080
 This is someone from an interview.

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:37.360
 He has an unusually high metabolism for productivity,

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.600
 a superhuman ability to focus.

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:42.240
 So anytime people write about him, they write about

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:44.680
 with these huge kind of descriptions on.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:45.560
 So check this out.

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:48.800
 OK, OK, OK, I'll justify why people think he's so impressive.

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:50.240
 He's not only an actor, he's an author,

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:52.400
 he's a director, he's a poet, he's a painter.

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.880
 Despite having an acting career, which he's constantly doing,

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:57.640
 he's doing postgraduate courses and got permission

00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:00.960
 to take as many as 62 course credits per quarter

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:04.880
 compared to the normal limit of 19 while continuing to act.

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:09.400
 He has an IQ of 140, which is considered to be a genius level.

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.840
 Although, when I was looking into that,

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:11.720
 I know it's a bit.

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:15.360
 It's very dubious, because the graph I saw had Mozart,

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:18.160
 Beethoven, James Franco, Stephen Hawking.

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:20.160
 No, Shakira.

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:23.040
 So it's a bit dubious.

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.360
 But so I kind of-- I started thinking, OK,

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:27.640
 that's the best Franco we have.

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:28.440
 I want to see what that is.

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:29.600
 A lot of my general Franco.

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:30.400
 General Franco.

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.280
 I mean, is he better than James Franco?

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:33.760
 Well, did he do more for it?

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:34.480
 Did he do more for it?

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:36.000
 He did more.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.360
 Maybe a few of movies, but was in charge of more countries.

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:40.560
 Yeah, I think that's fair.

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.960
 I did find one other guy who is his name.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.080
 He might be a better Franco.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:46.200
 He's called Jesus Franco.

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:47.360
 He's a Spanish director.

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:49.040
 He was born in 1930.

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:52.440
 Actually, he died late last year, rather sadly.

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:54.120
 He made over 180 movies.

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:56.280
 So he made a cult movie in 1961 called

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:58.200
 The Awful Doctor or Laugh.

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:00.960
 But then his career kind of took a side-where extent.

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.280
 So he made a movie called The Two Female Spies

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:05.760
 with Flowered Panties.

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:08.160
 A penis for three.

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:10.520
 Not a three penis one.

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:17.080
 Night of the Open Virginers, and Lulu's Talking Bunghole.

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.720
 And he was named by the Catholic Church

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:21.400
 as the most dangerous director out there.

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:22.920
 So he was called Jesus Franco.

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:27.920
 And then Franco's the first name of the first Italian in space.

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:28.920
 So we have an astronaut.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:29.920
 You know what that is?

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:30.920
 The Jesus guy.

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:32.920
 He was originally called Terence, but as they saw his film,

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:34.920
 they kept saying, "Jesus Franco."

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.920
 God's sake.

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:40.040
 But I think it's interesting.

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:42.440
 That's suddenly, you know, take one name, Franco.

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:44.320
 And he's talking Bunghole.

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:45.320
 Lulu's.

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:46.320
 Lulu's.

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:47.320
 Sorry.

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:48.320
 Night of the Open Virginers.

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.320
 I don't even know what that means.

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:52.720
 Is it like neither the living dead?

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:53.720
 Yeah.

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:54.720
 I don't know.

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:55.720
 It's a zombie vagina work.

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:56.720
 The Earth of Night.

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:57.720
 Yeah.

00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:00.120
 Well, did you know that used to be the theory about vaginas?

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:01.120
 They moved around the body.

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:02.120
 No.

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:04.120
 They would disappear into the middle of the night to go get food.

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:05.120
 What?

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:06.120
 Yeah.

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:08.120
 I read a book called It Should Be Here.

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:09.120
 It should be here.

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.120
 It should be here.

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:12.520
 It was called The Story of B.

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:15.520
 And it was all about vaginas, the history of vaginas.

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:16.520
 Okay.

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:17.520
 History of vaginas.

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:18.520
 The first notable vagina.

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:31.840
 The best thing I'm sorry about people's names is I went on to Facebook and NPR had done

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:36.400
 this post on Facebook saying, do you have a name which is similar to someone famous?

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:38.880
 If so, how is it affected your life?

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:41.440
 And there are 1100 comments on that.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.480
 I read through them all.

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:48.400
 But there was a girl called Sharon Stone who said, if I had a book for every time

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.680
 someone said, are you wearing panties?

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.440
 I'd be as rich as the actress.

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:53.440
 Oh, a book.

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.440
 I think so in a book.

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:56.960
 I have a book for every time.

00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:01.640
 I'd be able to have a very successful secondhand bookshop.

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:06.640
 And there was a guy called Dave Apps, who had to get a special permission from Facebook

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:08.840
 to have an account because his name was Apps.

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:09.840
 Oh.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.320
 Yeah, which is pretty good.

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:14.120
 And there's also a guy called Nicholas Dragon.

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:17.080
 And he said, I don't think there's anyone famous with my name.

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:20.800
 So anytime I meet someone new, they say, wow, that's a cool name.

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:24.320
 And a cool story, Nicholas.

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:27.680
 You're not wrong.

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:30.240
 Did you guys know that Samuel Johnson?

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.040
 I know we've got, so we found one.

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:33.040
 We found the other.

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.040
 We found the other Samuel Johnson.

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.040
 But actually, there was a third time.

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.040
 So can you give a repeat of what?

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:37.040
 Yeah, of course.

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:41.040
 So one of the other QI researchers found that there was another Samuel Johnson alive at

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:45.040
 the same time as Samuel Johnson, you know, the guy who wrote the dictionary, who was

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:50.600
 a dramatist and entertainer performer, who was also known as Lord Flame.

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:52.680
 That's a great name, that is.

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:53.680
 Yeah.

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:57.280
 But there was a third Samuel Johnson, who, so Samuel Johnson, the one we know about the

00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:01.600
 dictionary man, was asked to do a translation of this great work by Frau Paolo.

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:04.880
 I can't remember what it's called, but anyway, it was this great historical work.

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:05.880
 It was big cheese at the time.

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:07.880
 It was like the Harry Potter of its day.

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:10.000
 And so Samuel Johnson was like, yeah, I'll do that.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 Started translating it.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000
 Then found out that they'd also asked another guy, also called Samuel Johnson, to

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 do it.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 And so he kind of was fronted.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.240
 He was like, not only has someone else been asked to do it, but it's someone else called

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.240
 Samuel Johnson.

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:24.880
 And then there's this series of exchanges and newspapers, where Samuel Johnson won, is

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.880
 getting really angry with Samuel Johnson too.

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:28.720
 And eventually, noise of them translated the work.

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:31.160
 They just got this big skirmish, and they both went, well, I'll sort it then.

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.160
 Fine, I'm not doing it.

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:34.160
 And then Lord Flame came along with him.

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.160
 Hi.

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.160
 Watch me do it somehow.

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:42.160
 Oh, don't do a translation.

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:50.520
 Let's move on to our final fact.

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:51.520
 Andy, what's going to you?

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:52.520
 Yes.

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:53.520
 Okay.

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:58.040
 The fact is, the first contact lenses cost as much as a car.

00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:59.040
 Wow.

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:00.040
 What year was it?

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:03.480
 Well, they were invented in Germany in the late 1880s, originally, and Britain was a

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:04.800
 bit late to it.

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:05.800
 That was in the 1930s.

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:09.200
 But even in the 20s and 30s in Britain, so even though they'd been around in benefit

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.040
 50 years, they were still that expensive.

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:12.040
 Wow.

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:15.240
 So, they weren't presumably things that you would change every day.

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:16.240
 No, no, no.

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:19.840
 These were hard contact lenses, proper sort of shell like ones, and they were very thick

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:20.840
 as well.

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:23.840
 So they could only be one for two hours max at a time.

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:24.840
 Wow.

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:27.800
 And then the irritation in your eye was so great that you had to take them out.

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:30.080
 And initially, you had to have a mold taken of your eye.

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:33.600
 There are great videos, if you look up on British Pathay news.

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:36.440
 There are photos of people's eyelids being pulled apart.

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:38.960
 There's big mold being stuck in their eye.

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:43.520
 And they're sort of the promotional videos and the lady's saying, look, you look at how

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:44.520
 nice my eyes look.

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:46.240
 Now, I don't have to wear spectacles.

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:47.720
 And she's in the horizon, watery.

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:51.200
 It's really a great, little vein, it's really a great pain.

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.160
 Of the margins of the gun to her head.

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:56.000
 I just don't know if she's such clever and easy.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.000
 Wow.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.000
 It's really funny.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000
 You should look them up if you're listening.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.240
 Maybe you could post it on your tablet.

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:02.240
 Yeah, as well.

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:06.080
 I'll put it on my Twitter, which is @AndrewHunterM, and you'll be able to see.

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.040
 So, yeah, that was the first contact lenses.

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:11.480
 Well, you actually found this out because you went to a museum, didn't you?

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:17.040
 I went to the Museum of the British Optical Association, or British Optanvological Association.

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:20.920
 I didn't remember the name of it, but I did go to it.

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:22.240
 It's in Sharon Cross.

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:23.240
 It's great.

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:24.960
 Just on the same street, five doors apart.

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:28.080
 There's Benjamin Franklin's house from when he lived here.

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:29.080
 And this amazing museum.

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:31.120
 But you can only go around it by appointment.

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:35.200
 So you have to email the curator and say, I'd like to see all your cool stuff.

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.720
 And there's so much amazing stuff there.

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:41.080
 So not only that, the first ever soft contact lenses are much thinner and more comfortable.

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:44.880
 You had to, they came in a glass tube and to get access to the lenses, you had to break

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:45.880
 hope in the glass tube.

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:47.880
 So there are now shards of glass.

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:48.880
 And you're not.

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.920
 And there are your contact lenses.

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:56.200
 The first I'm promoting them with just crying blood, so I'm not afraid of them.

00:26:56.200 --> 00:27:02.560
 They were invented not to help you see.

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:06.080
 They were invented to shield people's eyes, because there's a medical condition called

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:07.080
 carocotonous.

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:08.080
 Carocotonous?

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:11.080
 But very close.

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:12.080
 It's called carocotonous.

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:15.920
 And it means you have a very, very sensitive, it's the core near, or is it at the front of

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:16.920
 the eye?

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:17.920
 Yeah.

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:19.840
 And it also becomes pointed.

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:23.640
 And so they were invented to help people discover their lives without the intense pain

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:24.640
 and irritation.

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:25.640
 Yeah.

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:29.920
 They were initially a medical thing in that sense rather than an eye second.

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:30.920
 Yeah.

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:34.200
 Did you guys know that Abraham Lincoln's contact lenses were made of wood?

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.200
 That's just not true.

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:37.200
 That's just not true.

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.200
 No.

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:39.200
 It's not.

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.200
 I'm sorry.

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.200
 You see, you see, you see.

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:51.580
 I read about supposedly René Descartes made some contact lenses that were made out of

00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:56.240
 what they were fluid inside that would magnify things, but they stuck so far out of your

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:59.440
 eye that you couldn't blink when you had them in contact.

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:00.440
 Wow.

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:01.440
 That's great.

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.440
 That's great.

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:09.320
 I tell you about that, the early snow goggles were made out of caribou antler, weren't they?

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:10.320
 Really?

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:11.320
 Yeah.

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:12.320
 And they weren't see-through.

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:16.120
 They just had a very small slit that you would be able to see through and it would protect

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:17.120
 your eyes when you were skiing.

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:18.120
 That was great.

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:19.120
 I guess that would work.

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:24.120
 I was surprised to read that 64% of people, supposedly, it's an estimate where glasses.

00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:25.120
 Have you got contacts?

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:26.120
 Yeah, yeah.

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:27.120
 I've got them in now.

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:28.120
 Well, you wear contacts?

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:29.120
 Yeah.

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:30.120
 Of course you've made them.

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:41.160
 You're okay with that loan off.

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:42.160
 Okay.

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:43.160
 That's it for this week's episode.

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.160
 That's all of our facts.

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:45.160
 Thanks so much, everyone, for listening.

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:46.160
 I hope you enjoyed it.

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:50.920
 We're going to be back again next week with a special edition of No Such Thing As A Fish.

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:55.640
 We've got two special guests, Greg Jenner, who's the historical consultant for the horrible

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:59.800
 history show, and we've got an American comedian called Alex Edelman.

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:03.120
 Until then, if you want to talk to us individually about some of the stuff that we set on the show,

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:08.640
 you can get me on @Sriberland, James can be got it on @egshaped, and he can be got it on

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:14.120
 @andrewhunterm, Anna is still not on Twitter, but if you want to get hold of her, @quickipedia,

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:18.120
 she answers all of those from there, or you could head straight away to our new podcast

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:20.120
 page, which is on qi.com/podcast.

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:21.120
 We're going to put up videos.

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:25.600
 We're going to put up pictures from this episode, Extra Facts, links to show you where

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:28.400
 we got some of the information on, there's a lot to play with.

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:32.080
 So again, send us your feedback, hopefully you enjoyed it, and we'll see you again next week.

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:33.080
 Good bye.
