1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
 We run it on QI a few years ago.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,200
 Yeah.

3
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,360
 Um, which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

4
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,720
 You didn't know such thing as a fish.

5
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:09,920
 No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,560
 He says it right there, first paragraph.

7
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,720
 No such thing as a fish.

8
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,880
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

9
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:24,360
 Oh, and welcome to the second episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish."

10
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,600
 This is a QIELF podcast coming to you from our office

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,040
 is in Covenant Garden.

12
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,680
 We want to say, first of all, thanks to everyone who

13
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,320
 listened to the first episode that we put out last week.

14
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,920
 Got huge numbers.

15
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,920
 We weren't expecting it.

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,440
 And really great feedback.

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,120
 There's a lot of technical hiccups that we are sorting out.

18
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,200
 We're going to get on with this second podcast now.

19
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,440
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

20
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,080
 I am sitting here with three other QIELs--

21
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,000
 James Harkin and H. Azinsky and Andy Murray.

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,240
 And once again, we're huddled around our microphone.

23
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,560
 And these are the best facts that we found out

24
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,920
 from the last seven days.

25
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,880
 So in no particular order, here we go.

26
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,120
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

27
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,080
 OK, first fact.

28
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,720
 And let's go with you, Anna.

29
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,360
 Yeah, I found out this week that the first ever sandwich

30
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,960
 that we know about contained wine.

31
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,480
 Yeah, but it was a wine sandwich.

32
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,080
 What?

33
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:11,880
 Well, it is.

34
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,720
 It's a sandwich.

35
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,560
 I think it's a bread with wine.

36
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,520
 We had had other stuff in it, but wine was one of the ingredients.

37
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,200
 Yeah, so the first recorded sandwich was actually more of a wrap.

38
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,360
 It was called a correction.

39
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,480
 It was invented by Hillel, who's a Jewish religious leader from,

40
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,920
 like, 100 BC.

41
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,800
 So the Jews have been, like, at this festival eating wine

42
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,080
 and figs and spices and stuff all mixed up together for about 1,000 years.

43
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,560
 And he decided to just shove it between some flatbread.

44
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,120
 And part of the concoction was wine and mixed up--

45
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,960
 So this isn't the Earl of Sandwich's invention.

46
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,800
 I'm doing the inverted colors side there,

47
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,600
 and I say that.

48
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,200
 So this is way before that.

49
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,800
 This is way before that.

50
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,560
 The Earl of Sandwich claims credit where it's not G.

51
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,760
 Yeah, I never heard that.

52
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,600
 And that's actually-- I don't think we've

53
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,240
 done that genig on QI who invented the sandwich, have we?

54
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,280
 No, but what did the other sandwich do, if anything?

55
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,880
 I think he was the first person to--

56
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,200
 I mean, he probably wasn't, but he was known for shoving meat

57
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,600
 between bread and the West.

58
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,840
 People say it's because he was a, like, a gracious gambler, yeah.

59
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,080
 Well, there's no way that he invented the sandwich anyway,

60
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,120
 is that because, like, obviously, for, like you say,

61
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,240
 for ever, people have been putting things in between two slices of meat.

62
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,160
 Yeah, it's so obvious.

63
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,040
 I think I'd like this idea of people just putting their name to something

64
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,600
 which has been invented for so long.

65
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,640
 Like, in 1999 in Japan, someone patented curry.

66
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,320
 Wow.

67
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:31,800
 Yeah.

68
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,520
 What happened was the very next year, 80 people

69
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,880
 tried to patent pizza after this, huh?

70
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,960
 Really, yeah.

71
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,600
 Well, there was a guy in Australia who successfully

72
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,480
 painted in the wheel, right?

73
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,080
 Oh, yeah.

74
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,040
 Successfully?

75
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,200
 Yeah, successfully.

76
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,200
 But that was actually the first wheel in Australia.

77
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,760
 It was just 20 years ago.

78
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,880
 [LAUGHTER]

79
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,400
 Yeah, he did.

80
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,400
 He successfully did it.

81
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,280
 And it made it past.

82
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,080
 And he did it as a kind of parody protest

83
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,320
 to show how things were getting through the net when it came to patents.

84
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:02,840
 Oh, thank you.

85
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,880
 Because I think to a lot of people getting stuff stolen in Australia

86
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,840
 as an invention.

87
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,720
 And so--

88
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,220
 OK.

89
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:08,720
 Yeah, he successfully did it.

90
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,240
 I remember the guy in the '70s who patented the colmover.

91
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,240
 Oh, yeah.

92
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,520
 Obviously that's been happening forever, but yeah, yeah.

93
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,440
 This is from the Wikipedia about the sandwich full disclosure.

94
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,800
 But what it says is, before being known as sandwiches,

95
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,640
 this food combination seems to simply

96
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,560
 have been known as bread and meat.

97
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,920
 [LAUGHTER]

98
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,920
 Or meat and bread.

99
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,160
 Or meat and bread, cheese.

100
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,200
 [LAUGHTER]

101
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,440
 Hang on, I just thought that would work for all fillings.

102
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:38,940
 Yeah.

103
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,040
 You just bread and--

104
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,760
 Yeah, bread and cheese and bread and cheese.

105
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,520
 Yeah.

106
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,800
 I'm just going to go and have a cheese and ham, bread and cheese and ham.

107
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,760
 [LAUGHTER]

108
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:54,120
 I was thinking about-- because the idea of wine going into a sandwich

109
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,920
 is it's a nice thing about what else goes into a sandwich

110
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,920
 that you would not expect.

111
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,880
 But then I started thinking, oh, but there's a lot of stuff

112
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,400
 that goes into wine that we don't expect.

113
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:02,900
 OK.

114
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,160
 But there's a nettle wine.

115
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,160
 So nettle being those stingy knives.

116
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,280
 Yeah, so you can get nettle.

117
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,720
 That's a cannabis wine, which is available,

118
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,640
 which has become really popular in the US.

119
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,600
 This is my favorite one.

120
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,040
 It's a chilean wine.

121
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,160
 And it's been created using meaty right

122
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,440
 for them during the birth of a solar system.

123
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,280
 What?

124
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,480
 Yeah, so it's a-- it's been developed by a guy called Ian Hutchin.

125
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,320
 He's an English guy working in Chile.

126
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,640
 It's a meteorite that's believed to have

127
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,200
 crashed in the Atacama desert in northern Chile,

128
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,000
 about 6,000 years ago.

129
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,920
 And it's submerged in the wine during the fermentation process.

130
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,760
 Yeah, so it's a meaty right wine.

131
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,440
 I mean, that's--

132
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,680
 Well, that's pretty cool.

133
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,140
 Yeah, I really want to tell you that.

134
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:44,800
 In China, you can get something called three penis wine.

135
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,920
 Can you guess what's in that?

136
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,040
 Two penises.

137
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,640
 No, three penises.

138
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:53,160
 It does contain three different penises.

139
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,160
 Of what?

140
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,400
 OK, so deer.

141
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,560
 Yeah, deer is one of them.

142
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,400
 And it's supposed to be like a general pick me up kind of.

143
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,120
 But deer, maybe a bird?

144
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,240
 One of the birds with a penis?

145
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,040
 Yeah, most birds don't have penises today.

146
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,720
 97% of bird species have no penises.

147
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,440
 But the other three, some of them

148
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,360
 have very, very positive players.

149
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,120
 Yeah.

150
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,400
 The Argentinian lake dot.

151
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,280
 45 centimeters and curled.

152
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,680
 And that's just a blu-tit.

153
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,080
 If you're listening to this at home,

154
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,440
 Google Argentinian lake dot penis.

155
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,240
 And you'll see exactly what Andy's talking about.

156
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,120
 It is epic.

157
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,880
 Wow.

158
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,320
 Well, what's the third penis?

159
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,480
 I can't remember.

160
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,200
 History penis.

161
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,200
 History penis.

162
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,040
 History.

163
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,080
 Lucky did penis.

164
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,200
 Penis du jour.

165
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,680
 There is one other wine.

166
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,960
 It's a Japanese wine, which is called Japanese feces wine.

167
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,200
 It's no-dose tongsul.

168
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,400
 And it's primarily made using human or animal feces.

169
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,120
 So what's the third kind of feces?

170
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,360
 I'm going to give you one.

171
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,240
 I'm going to trump that even for a disgusting wine.

172
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,400
 In 1495, it was reported that the Spanish

173
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,440
 were mixing the blood of lepers with their wine

174
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,520
 and feeding it to the French as a only kind of biological

175
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,280
 warfare.

176
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,840
 Well, they're war at the time.

177
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,880
 It wasn't a preemptive.

178
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,280
 OK.

179
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,480
 No, sorry, leper war.

180
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,600
 Lepper's blood.

181
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,440
 But it probably wouldn't have done any harm.

182
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,040
 No.

183
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:28,200
 Because 90% of people, 95, are immune to Hansen's disease.

184
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,000
 Hansen's disease are leprosy anyway.

185
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,200
 And a lot of people will probably

186
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,160
 misidentifying leprosy even then as other skin conditions.

187
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,920
 I'd really like to quickly say a word

188
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,000
 for about the Earl of Sandwich, because I love him.

189
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,440
 It's actually the current Earl of Sandwich.

190
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,720
 I wanted to mention the 11th Earl of Sandwich,

191
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,280
 who's direct descendant of the Earl of Sandwich, because he--

192
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,840
 so he's obviously thought, I'm the Earl of Sandwich.

193
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,640
 And I've got this son called Orlando.

194
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,880
 So he's got Orlando who's going to be the Earl of Sandwich.

195
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,760
 So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go and set up

196
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,400
 a sandwich shop and go into business with this guy called

197
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,600
 Robert Earl, and it's going to be in Orlando.

198
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,520
 And so that's what he did.

199
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,520
 So the current Earl of Sandwich owns the sandwich shop

200
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,000
 in Disneyland, Orlando.

201
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,760
 Called Orlando Blumas.

202
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,560
 It should be.

203
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,400
 It should be.

204
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,720
 It's called the Earl of Sandwich.

205
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,680
 The good thing about the Disneyland in Tokyo,

206
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,080
 you'll know this better than me, Andy,

207
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,480
 but didn't the not one of the North Korean Kim Jong, you know, this guy?

208
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,560
 One of Kim Jong Il's three sons was disinherited

209
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,840
 for going to one of the Disneyland's.

210
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,360
 Really?

211
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,200
 Yeah, right?

212
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,400
 He had three sons, and the first two botched it.

213
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,000
 And I can't remember how the other one did,

214
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,440
 but Kim Jong Nam is the eldest son of Kim Jong Il.

215
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:44,120
 And he was detained in Japan with a fraudulent passport in 2001.

216
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,600
 He was trying to pass himself off as a Dominican named

217
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,640
 Pang Xiong, which translates as Fat Bear in Chinese.

218
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,400
 And so they deported him.

219
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,640
 But he was trying to visit Tokyo, Disneyland, with his family.

220
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,280
 I got told the other day that who is this?

221
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,440
 Someone I know went to South Korea,

222
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,800
 and they stood at the border of South Korea and North Korea.

223
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,240
 And apparently what you see when you're at the South looking at the North

224
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,200
 is a huge cardboard cutout of a city

225
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,680
 that North Korea has put up to give the impression

226
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,760
 that they're a huge metropolis from South Korea.

227
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,800
 Oh, OK, they call them Potemkin towns, don't they?

228
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,840
 Yeah, but it's just, it's like, literally like,

229
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,800
 imagine the Hollywood sign, but done as a ginormous looking city.

230
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,440
 So that's what you see when you--

231
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,480
 What happens when it rains?

232
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,840
 What's made of, like, I'm sure they laminated it, for some reason.

233
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,440
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

234
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,560
 What's the--

235
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,240
 There isn't an extra area at the border where they both work.

236
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,040
 That was where there were a lot of recent tension.

237
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,000
 And they shut down called the Kaisom industrial area.

238
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,680
 And actually workers from both countries

239
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,200
 go into it every day, thousands of them work together.

240
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,920
 So there's this one weird point of contact

241
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,800
 between the two countries.

242
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,920
 What my favorite fact about that part of the world

243
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,880
 is it's called the demilitarized zone, isn't it?

244
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,400
 Yes.

245
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,600
 But it's the world's most militarized zone.

246
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,000
 Yeah, that's it.

247
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,560
 That's all right, isn't it?

248
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,480
 Why isn't that the one in the house that it's on?

249
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,080
 I can't say.

250
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,880
 I missed out on so many opportunities.

251
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,960
 Didn't scan.

252
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,120
 [LAUGHTER]

253
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,240
 We should have been written QI version.

254
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,000
 I don't know.

255
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,200
 I'll land it as more as that.

256
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:17,800
 OK, let's move on to fact two.

257
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,400
 James, this is your effect.

258
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,520
 Yeah, I like this one.

259
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:25,400
 It's in 2003, three people in Mexico died of acne.

260
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,200
 So--

261
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:26,960
 I love that.

262
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,960
 I'm pretty sure you can't die of acne.

263
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,960
 I know.

264
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,920
 I don't know how they died.

265
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,240
 This just came from a list of the ways that people died.

266
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,600
 So it's on nationmaster.com.

267
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,920
 And it gives all of the mortality stats

268
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,600
 for all the different countries.

269
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,320
 And so if you looked for people dying of acne,

270
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,120
 there were seven deaths worldwide, three of which

271
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,600
 occurred in Mexico.

272
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,240
 And what I think it is, it's just the way

273
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,720
 that they do their stats.

274
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,120
 And other countries might have people dying of the same thing,

275
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,640
 but they don't say it's a vaccine.

276
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,000
 So they just died with acne?

277
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,400
 Yeah.

278
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,960
 Let's just say it's that.

279
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,960
 Because I can see that.

280
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,080
 And I don't have to cut a movie.

281
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,720
 It looks to me like you died of being a five foot six male.

282
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,720
 Yeah.

283
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,680
 Yeah, maybe they just, they have to write--

284
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,520
 they have to tick a box of what they died with and the acne

285
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,280
 is right at the very top.

286
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,200
 And they just lay eyes.

287
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,040
 The first answer was, yeah, it's an ailment right at the top.

288
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,000
 Is it on Varka, does he?

289
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,600
 No.

290
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,680
 So yeah, it's going to be--

291
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,200
 It could be killed by an arid vark.

292
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,720
 Yeah.

293
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,480
 Death.

294
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,760
 They don't have a list of people who were killed by animals.

295
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:34,640
 27 worldwide in 2003, people killed by contact with millipedes,

296
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,400
 which is pretty cool.

297
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,400
 Poisonous millipedes?

298
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,920
 Or, yeah, venomous ones.

299
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,800
 And I think five of those were in El Salvador.

300
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,760
 I seem to remember you telling me ages ago

301
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,280
 that in Australia, no one's died of this.

302
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,160
 And no one's ever died in Australia.

303
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,160
 It's really interesting.

304
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:49,680
 Yeah.

305
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,120
 But we don't have acne in Australia.

306
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,200
 So no, it's not.

307
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,920
 But no one's been by spider or snake

308
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,760
 has died in the last 50 years.

309
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,840
 It's certainly been a long time since a spider bite killed anyone

310
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,720
 because they have very good antivenom, though, in Australia.

311
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,440
 I think it was the 1980s.

312
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,520
 And I just remember looking this up,

313
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,520
 because I got paranoid that I'd been bitten by a black spider

314
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,680
 in Tasmania.

315
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,680
 Pretty sure that I was going to be the next case.

316
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,440
 Wow.

317
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,040
 What we do a lot on QI is find people with funny deaths.

318
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,720
 And I don't think that's bad, because death

319
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,640
 is just a part of life.

320
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,720
 And you know, we all die.

321
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,520
 And if it can be a funny thing, then that's good.

322
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,440
 So you could have been in one of those lists of--

323
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,840
 You could have been a fat, famous death.

324
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,800
 You would have liked it.

325
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,240
 It would have been announced in the QI office.

326
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,840
 And you would have been like, that's awesome.

327
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,360
 That's great.

328
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,040
 But no, my bad.

329
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,000
 That's going on a series.

330
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,520
 I almost had a death, which I thought, if it happened,

331
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,000
 it would have made a nice list for you.

332
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,440
 Well, when I was living in Hampstead,

333
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,640
 we got evacuated from our apartment one day

334
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,920
 because police were outside.

335
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,760
 They didn't even tell us.

336
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,200
 But we went outside, and then they didn't let us back in.

337
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,120
 And I was like, what's going on?

338
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,320
 And they said, we found in the basement of your flat

339
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,680
 an unexploded World War II bomb.

340
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,200
 And so they had people inside detonating the bomb.

341
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,120
 But it struck me that had that gone off.

342
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,440
 The person calling my parents, the police officer,

343
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,320
 would have had to have said, your son's

344
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,680
 met with a tragic accident.

345
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,800
 So how do you die?

346
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,440
 Well, he was blown up.

347
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,840
 Who did this?

348
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,600
 We believe it to be the work of the Nazi.

349
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,160
 I would have become a victim of World War II.

350
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,760
 I know that's Hitler would have killed him.

351
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,520
 I haven't even worse one than that because there

352
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,080
 was a Russian psychic in the '80s who

353
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,200
 wanted to prove that he was psychic.

354
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,440
 And so he stood in front of a moving train

355
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,960
 and tried to stop it with his mind and was killed by the train.

356
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,760
 Oh, my God.

357
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,640
 I have one death, which I'd like to share.

358
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,360
 Please, wow.

359
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,920
 This is the man who introduced the camel to Australia.

360
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,560
 His name is John Ainsworth Horricks.

361
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,720
 And he died in 1846.

362
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,640
 And he brought the first camels there

363
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,480
 because they were used to build the railways.

364
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,600
 And the result is now that there

365
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,120
 were a million feral camels in Australia.

366
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,280
 But anyway, the man who introduced him, John Ainsworth Horricks,

367
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,680
 was killed by his own camel.

368
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,680
 What?

369
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,840
 He trampled to death?

370
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,160
 No, he was riding it.

371
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,480
 And he was reloading his gun.

372
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,800
 It sort of lurched a bit as he did so.

373
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,840
 And the gun went off, blasted him in the arm and in the body.

374
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,600
 He lived four days during which he ordered the camel to be shot.

375
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,960
 [LAUGHTER]

376
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,840
 What a bit in there.

377
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,160
 I looked at him so acne, just because I was so skeptical

378
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,360
 about the idea of acne killing you.

379
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,800
 So and then got really caught up in theories about acne

380
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,400
 from the 19th century, what caused it?

381
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,400
 So for like 150 years, they were referred to as chastity

382
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,960
 postures because it was thought that the reason you had acne

383
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,280
 was because you weren't having sex.

384
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,880
 And so like doctors wrote--

385
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,680
 so I put this quote from a doctor in about 8 to the 1830s--

386
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,680
 it is a fact that this affection disappears

387
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,520
 in young girls immediately after marriage.

388
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,080
 And there is especially seen in young men

389
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,160
 who observe rigorous chastity.

390
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,920
 And so they thought, well, so first of all, doctors

391
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,840
 recommend that you marry as soon as possible to get rid of them.

392
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,920
 And then they thought another way of like alleviating

393
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,400
 it was to give people laxatives.

394
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,760
 Because that I guess, like, I don't know, excels--

395
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,360
 Courage is due in a similar way.

396
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,520
 But weirdly, they do actually work to cure acne.

397
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,640
 So they try laxatives and laxatives do work.

398
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,160
 OK.

399
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,320
 I think I can tell you my acne cleanse.

400
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,040
 Gone from the Greek word "knayon," meaning

401
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,520
 I know, or I scrape.

402
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,120
 Oh, really?

403
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:18,640
 Yeah.

404
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,000
 I have another cool death here.

405
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,160
 This was a guy called Morton Norbury.

406
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,600
 And in 1910, all I know about him is he

407
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,600
 was killed after an argument over who

408
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,720
 possessed the most handsome mustache.

409
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,280
 [LAUGHTER]

410
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,640
 That's such a good death.

411
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,440
 That's wonderful.

412
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:34,800
 What's his name?

413
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,480
 Morton Norbury?

414
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,280
 Morton Norbury.

415
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:36,920
 It's a great name.

416
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,080
 He sounds so like a guy with a huge mustache.

417
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,160
 I wanted his life.

418
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,720
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

419
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,960
 OK, time for fact number three.

420
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,800
 That is my fact.

421
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,040
 This week, I bought a copy of--

422
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,200
 there's a new book out called "This Is Improbable 2"

423
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,160
 by Mark Abrams.

424
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,720
 Mark Abrams is the founder of the Ignobile Prizes.

425
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,600
 He's also a good kind of QI family friend.

426
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,680
 Yeah, we love him.

427
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,480
 We've-- he's been on museumic curiosity.

428
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,600
 We often do talks at his Ignobile tours.

429
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,040
 One's going to be happening this year.

430
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,920
 Yeah, if you go on to-- if you check out Mark Abram--

431
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,280
 he's at Mark Abram's.

432
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,800
 I'll check out mine at X-Shake.

433
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,640
 We'll post up when we're going to be appearing in that.

434
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,960
 So he's so this book is basically a collection.

435
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,420
 He runs as well as the Nobel Prizes

436
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:22,360
 a magazine, which is called "The Annals of Improbable Research."

437
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,200
 And it's a kind of a collection of all the greatest research

438
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,520
 projects have been undertaken by scientists around the world.

439
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,840
 He collects them, rewrites them.

440
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,520
 And so I'm reading the book at the moment.

441
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,400
 And there was one story, which it's not so much a fact,

442
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,000
 but I'd really like the idea of it.

443
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,520
 It's all the other notable Einstein's out there.

444
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,360
 His point being that it's very hard

445
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,880
 to have the surname Einstein, if he worked in science,

446
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:46,080
 because there's quite a famous one who worked in science,

447
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,480
 and he often overshadows the rest of them.

448
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,480
 So the most notable ones that are out there

449
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,880
 is Emmy Einstein, who has set an equation

450
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,000
 that predicts the composition of a pork carcass.

451
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,800
 There's also a lady called Rosemary Einstein,

452
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,680
 who she and two other colleagues at the University

453
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,920
 of Leeds investigated the use of cannabis and alcohol

454
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,880
 and tobacco by 300 young persons at the university.

455
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,320
 So these are two people who've published reports

456
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,760
 that have been quite successful in the scientific community.

457
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,440
 But it did get me thinking about other namesakes.

458
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:21,360
 The other people with incredible shadows to jump over.

459
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,160
 And--

460
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,160
 Yeah, it must be hard.

461
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,920
 I'll maybe open some doors.

462
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,360
 Or maybe it just puts a lot of pressure on you.

463
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:28,920
 I think you're right.

464
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,120
 I think it does open doors.

465
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,960
 So are there any other old barmas out there at the moment?

466
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,120
 At the moment, not real.

467
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,600
 I mean, there's a prime minister in--

468
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,000
 I can't remember what country, but he's Obama,

469
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,040
 and he's currently in power.

470
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:40,560
 Really?

471
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,440
 Yeah, wow.

472
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,880
 Yeah, I don't think he's related, but he's--

473
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,720
 I'll see if I can--

474
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,040
 It's not actually Obama, just secretly

475
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,440
 running a thing on the side.

476
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,120
 I have one found in Obama, which I think is--

477
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,840
 OK, better.

478
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,640
 Then the current?

479
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,320
 Then the current.

480
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:53,840
 Yes, Obama.

481
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,840
 Yes, Obama.

482
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,680
 No way.

483
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,800
 It's the city of Obama in Japan.

484
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,640
 Oh, yes.

485
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,680
 Don't say-- come on.

486
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,760
 OK, I'll give you a chance.

487
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,840
 It's got a population of 32,000.

488
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,160
 So already, that's pretty good.

489
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,120
 Imagine they'll be quite productive, and they make 80% of Japan's

490
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,680
 total lack of chopsticks.

491
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,640
 Oh, that is great.

492
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,560
 That is great.

493
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,080
 Yeah.

494
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,440
 So why can't the president say he's done that?

495
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,720
 Made 80% of Japan's lack of chopsticks.

496
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,640
 He can't.

497
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,680
 He's working two jobs as it is, of course.

498
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,360
 But yeah, I mean, it is one of those things.

499
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,680
 We all have names, so you, James Harkin,

500
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,720
 have a James Harkin do.

501
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,120
 Yeah, there's another James Harkin who writes for the Guardian,

502
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,320
 I think, or some other newspapers.

503
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,640
 And Molly from QI met him at a party once.

504
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,360
 And apparently, he doesn't correct people

505
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,960
 when they think he works for QI.

506
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,560
 And he said, if I ever want to claim any of his articles,

507
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,880
 which I'm sure are very good, that I can do that as well.

508
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,680
 It's nice.

509
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:54,040
 I was going into a co-operative with someone else.

510
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,720
 I should do that with the other Andy Murray.

511
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,800
 With the other Andy Murray, yeah.

512
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,640
 I would just do a straight split of everything,

513
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,640
 you know, the money.

514
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,160
 Start-accompanied.

515
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,440
 Or whatever, you know?

516
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,320
 Andy, is your listening to this now?

517
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,720
 Just please, please get in touch.

518
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,720
 Well, he needs to listen, because people are coming up,

519
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,160
 going, hey, great work on the podcast.

520
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,520
 Yeah, thanks, cheers.

521
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,480
 Yeah.

522
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,640
 My thing about the etymology of ACME, you know.

523
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,080
 This week, I've been trying to come up

524
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,680
 with some new facts for our books.

525
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,440
 So we did one, three, three, nine QI facts,

526
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,760
 Albuquerismus, and we're selling it to America.

527
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,600
 And we need to come up with some facts at work

528
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,000
 for an American audience to replace the ones

529
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,760
 that were for a British audience.

530
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,280
 And one that I really liked was that the first ever player

531
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,480
 drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers NFL team

532
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,200
 was called William Shakespeare.

533
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,200
 Oh.

534
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,040
 Isn't that great?

535
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:43,880
 Yeah.

536
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,880
 I really love that.

537
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,880
 And it's great, and it's great as well,

538
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,240
 because you can imagine that any of the journalists

539
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,520
 who really struggle with running out of cliches, basically,

540
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,640
 that's just a gift.

541
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,760
 Like, you suddenly got Shakespeare as a baseball player.

542
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,760
 Yeah.

543
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,120
 And he's a football player.

544
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,840
 And a foul player.

545
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,880
 Not so good.

546
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,320
 [LAUGHTER]

547
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,640
 Dad, I was drinking baseball.

548
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,840
 Oh, no.

549
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,840
 Yeah.

550
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,640
 That's what I was doing.

551
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,160
 I tried to actually test out the theory of someone who

552
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:15,000
 was great, like, do my own kind of collection of Einstein's,

553
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,520
 as it were.

554
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,240
 So I try to think of the most impressive person alive.

555
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,280
 So I picked who I think is sometimes

556
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,720
 pitted as the greatest living mind at the moment.

557
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,000
 So the actor James Franco--

558
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,120
 James Franco is consistently-- if you read a paper on him,

559
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,960
 treated as some sort of great god of the intellectual--

560
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,280
 for example, this is a quote.

561
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,080
 This is someone from an interview.

562
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,360
 He has an unusually high metabolism for productivity,

563
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,600
 a superhuman ability to focus.

564
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,240
 So anytime people write about him, they write about

565
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,680
 with these huge kind of descriptions on.

566
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,560
 So check this out.

567
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,800
 OK, OK, OK, I'll justify why people think he's so impressive.

568
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,240
 He's not only an actor, he's an author,

569
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,400
 he's a director, he's a poet, he's a painter.

570
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,880
 Despite having an acting career, which he's constantly doing,

571
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,640
 he's doing postgraduate courses and got permission

572
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,960
 to take as many as 62 course credits per quarter

573
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,880
 compared to the normal limit of 19 while continuing to act.

574
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,400
 He has an IQ of 140, which is considered to be a genius level.

575
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,840
 Although, when I was looking into that,

576
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,720
 I know it's a bit.

577
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,360
 It's very dubious, because the graph I saw had Mozart,

578
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,160
 Beethoven, James Franco, Stephen Hawking.

579
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,160
 No, Shakira.

580
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,040
 So it's a bit dubious.

581
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,360
 But so I kind of-- I started thinking, OK,

582
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,640
 that's the best Franco we have.

583
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,440
 I want to see what that is.

584
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,600
 A lot of my general Franco.

585
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,400
 General Franco.

586
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,280
 I mean, is he better than James Franco?

587
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,760
 Well, did he do more for it?

588
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,480
 Did he do more for it?

589
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,000
 He did more.

590
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,360
 Maybe a few of movies, but was in charge of more countries.

591
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,560
 Yeah, I think that's fair.

592
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,960
 I did find one other guy who is his name.

593
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,080
 He might be a better Franco.

594
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,200
 He's called Jesus Franco.

595
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,360
 He's a Spanish director.

596
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,040
 He was born in 1930.

597
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,440
 Actually, he died late last year, rather sadly.

598
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,120
 He made over 180 movies.

599
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,280
 So he made a cult movie in 1961 called

600
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,200
 The Awful Doctor or Laugh.

601
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,960
 But then his career kind of took a side-where extent.

602
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,280
 So he made a movie called The Two Female Spies

603
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,760
 with Flowered Panties.

604
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,160
 A penis for three.

605
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,520
 Not a three penis one.

606
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:17,080
 Night of the Open Virginers, and Lulu's Talking Bunghole.

607
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,720
 And he was named by the Catholic Church

608
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,400
 as the most dangerous director out there.

609
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,920
 So he was called Jesus Franco.

610
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:27,920
 And then Franco's the first name of the first Italian in space.

611
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,920
 So we have an astronaut.

612
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,920
 You know what that is?

613
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,920
 The Jesus guy.

614
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,920
 He was originally called Terence, but as they saw his film,

615
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,920
 they kept saying, "Jesus Franco."

616
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,920
 God's sake.

617
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,040
 But I think it's interesting.

618
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,440
 That's suddenly, you know, take one name, Franco.

619
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,320
 And he's talking Bunghole.

620
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,320
 Lulu's.

621
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,320
 Lulu's.

622
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,320
 Sorry.

623
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,320
 Night of the Open Virginers.

624
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,320
 I don't even know what that means.

625
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,720
 Is it like neither the living dead?

626
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,720
 Yeah.

627
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,720
 I don't know.

628
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,720
 It's a zombie vagina work.

629
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,720
 The Earth of Night.

630
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,720
 Yeah.

631
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,120
 Well, did you know that used to be the theory about vaginas?

632
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,120
 They moved around the body.

633
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,120
 No.

634
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,120
 They would disappear into the middle of the night to go get food.

635
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,120
 What?

636
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,120
 Yeah.

637
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,120
 I read a book called It Should Be Here.

638
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,120
 It should be here.

639
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,120
 It should be here.

640
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,520
 It was called The Story of B.

641
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:15,520
 And it was all about vaginas, the history of vaginas.

642
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,520
 Okay.

643
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,520
 History of vaginas.

644
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,520
 The first notable vagina.

645
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:31,840
 The best thing I'm sorry about people's names is I went on to Facebook and NPR had done

646
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,400
 this post on Facebook saying, do you have a name which is similar to someone famous?

647
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,880
 If so, how is it affected your life?

648
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,440
 And there are 1100 comments on that.

649
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,480
 I read through them all.

650
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:48,400
 But there was a girl called Sharon Stone who said, if I had a book for every time

651
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,680
 someone said, are you wearing panties?

652
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,440
 I'd be as rich as the actress.

653
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,440
 Oh, a book.

654
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,440
 I think so in a book.

655
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,960
 I have a book for every time.

656
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,640
 I'd be able to have a very successful secondhand bookshop.

657
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:06,640
 And there was a guy called Dave Apps, who had to get a special permission from Facebook

658
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,840
 to have an account because his name was Apps.

659
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,840
 Oh.

660
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,320
 Yeah, which is pretty good.

661
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,120
 And there's also a guy called Nicholas Dragon.

662
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,080
 And he said, I don't think there's anyone famous with my name.

663
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,800
 So anytime I meet someone new, they say, wow, that's a cool name.

664
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,320
 And a cool story, Nicholas.

665
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,680
 You're not wrong.

666
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,240
 Did you guys know that Samuel Johnson?

667
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,040
 I know we've got, so we found one.

668
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,040
 We found the other.

669
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,040
 We found the other Samuel Johnson.

670
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,040
 But actually, there was a third time.

671
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,040
 So can you give a repeat of what?

672
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,040
 Yeah, of course.

673
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:41,040
 So one of the other QI researchers found that there was another Samuel Johnson alive at

674
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:45,040
 the same time as Samuel Johnson, you know, the guy who wrote the dictionary, who was

675
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:50,600
 a dramatist and entertainer performer, who was also known as Lord Flame.

676
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,680
 That's a great name, that is.

677
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,680
 Yeah.

678
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:57,280
 But there was a third Samuel Johnson, who, so Samuel Johnson, the one we know about the

679
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:01,600
 dictionary man, was asked to do a translation of this great work by Frau Paolo.

680
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,880
 I can't remember what it's called, but anyway, it was this great historical work.

681
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,880
 It was big cheese at the time.

682
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,880
 It was like the Harry Potter of its day.

683
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,000
 And so Samuel Johnson was like, yeah, I'll do that.

684
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 Started translating it.

685
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 Then found out that they'd also asked another guy, also called Samuel Johnson, to

686
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 do it.

687
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 And so he kind of was fronted.

688
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,240
 He was like, not only has someone else been asked to do it, but it's someone else called

689
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,240
 Samuel Johnson.

690
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,880
 And then there's this series of exchanges and newspapers, where Samuel Johnson won, is

691
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,880
 getting really angry with Samuel Johnson too.

692
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,720
 And eventually, noise of them translated the work.

693
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,160
 They just got this big skirmish, and they both went, well, I'll sort it then.

694
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,160
 Fine, I'm not doing it.

695
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,160
 And then Lord Flame came along with him.

696
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,160
 Hi.

697
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,160
 Watch me do it somehow.

698
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:42,160
 Oh, don't do a translation.

699
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:50,520
 Let's move on to our final fact.

700
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,520
 Andy, what's going to you?

701
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,520
 Yes.

702
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,520
 Okay.

703
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,040
 The fact is, the first contact lenses cost as much as a car.

704
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,040
 Wow.

705
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,040
 What year was it?

706
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,480
 Well, they were invented in Germany in the late 1880s, originally, and Britain was a

707
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,800
 bit late to it.

708
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,800
 That was in the 1930s.

709
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:09,200
 But even in the 20s and 30s in Britain, so even though they'd been around in benefit

710
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,040
 50 years, they were still that expensive.

711
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,040
 Wow.

712
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:15,240
 So, they weren't presumably things that you would change every day.

713
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,240
 No, no, no.

714
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,840
 These were hard contact lenses, proper sort of shell like ones, and they were very thick

715
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,840
 as well.

716
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,840
 So they could only be one for two hours max at a time.

717
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,840
 Wow.

718
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,800
 And then the irritation in your eye was so great that you had to take them out.

719
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,080
 And initially, you had to have a mold taken of your eye.

720
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,600
 There are great videos, if you look up on British Pathay news.

721
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,440
 There are photos of people's eyelids being pulled apart.

722
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,960
 There's big mold being stuck in their eye.

723
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,520
 And they're sort of the promotional videos and the lady's saying, look, you look at how

724
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,520
 nice my eyes look.

725
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,240
 Now, I don't have to wear spectacles.

726
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,720
 And she's in the horizon, watery.

727
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,200
 It's really a great, little vein, it's really a great pain.

728
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,160
 Of the margins of the gun to her head.

729
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,000
 I just don't know if she's such clever and easy.

730
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 Wow.

731
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 It's really funny.

732
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 You should look them up if you're listening.

733
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,240
 Maybe you could post it on your tablet.

734
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,240
 Yeah, as well.

735
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,080
 I'll put it on my Twitter, which is @AndrewHunterM, and you'll be able to see.

736
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,040
 So, yeah, that was the first contact lenses.

737
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:11,480
 Well, you actually found this out because you went to a museum, didn't you?

738
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:17,040
 I went to the Museum of the British Optical Association, or British Optanvological Association.

739
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,920
 I didn't remember the name of it, but I did go to it.

740
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,240
 It's in Sharon Cross.

741
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,240
 It's great.

742
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,960
 Just on the same street, five doors apart.

743
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,080
 There's Benjamin Franklin's house from when he lived here.

744
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,080
 And this amazing museum.

745
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,120
 But you can only go around it by appointment.

746
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,200
 So you have to email the curator and say, I'd like to see all your cool stuff.

747
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,720
 And there's so much amazing stuff there.

748
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,080
 So not only that, the first ever soft contact lenses are much thinner and more comfortable.

749
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:44,880
 You had to, they came in a glass tube and to get access to the lenses, you had to break

750
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,880
 hope in the glass tube.

751
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,880
 So there are now shards of glass.

752
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,880
 And you're not.

753
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,920
 And there are your contact lenses.

754
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:56,200
 The first I'm promoting them with just crying blood, so I'm not afraid of them.

755
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:02,560
 They were invented not to help you see.

756
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:06,080
 They were invented to shield people's eyes, because there's a medical condition called

757
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,080
 carocotonous.

758
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,080
 Carocotonous?

759
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,080
 But very close.

760
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,080
 It's called carocotonous.

761
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,920
 And it means you have a very, very sensitive, it's the core near, or is it at the front of

762
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,920
 the eye?

763
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,920
 Yeah.

764
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,840
 And it also becomes pointed.

765
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,640
 And so they were invented to help people discover their lives without the intense pain

766
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,640
 and irritation.

767
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,640
 Yeah.

768
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:29,920
 They were initially a medical thing in that sense rather than an eye second.

769
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,920
 Yeah.

770
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:34,200
 Did you guys know that Abraham Lincoln's contact lenses were made of wood?

771
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,200
 That's just not true.

772
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,200
 That's just not true.

773
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,200
 No.

774
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,200
 It's not.

775
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,200
 I'm sorry.

776
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,200
 You see, you see, you see.

777
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:51,580
 I read about supposedly René Descartes made some contact lenses that were made out of

778
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:56,240
 what they were fluid inside that would magnify things, but they stuck so far out of your

779
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,440
 eye that you couldn't blink when you had them in contact.

780
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,440
 Wow.

781
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,440
 That's great.

782
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,440
 That's great.

783
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:09,320
 I tell you about that, the early snow goggles were made out of caribou antler, weren't they?

784
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,320
 Really?

785
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,320
 Yeah.

786
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,320
 And they weren't see-through.

787
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,120
 They just had a very small slit that you would be able to see through and it would protect

788
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,120
 your eyes when you were skiing.

789
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,120
 That was great.

790
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,120
 I guess that would work.

791
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:24,120
 I was surprised to read that 64% of people, supposedly, it's an estimate where glasses.

792
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,120
 Have you got contacts?

793
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,120
 Yeah, yeah.

794
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,120
 I've got them in now.

795
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,120
 Well, you wear contacts?

796
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,120
 Yeah.

797
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,120
 Of course you've made them.

798
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:41,160
 You're okay with that loan off.

799
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,160
 Okay.

800
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,160
 That's it for this week's episode.

801
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,160
 That's all of our facts.

802
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,160
 Thanks so much, everyone, for listening.

803
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,160
 I hope you enjoyed it.

804
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:50,920
 We're going to be back again next week with a special edition of No Such Thing As A Fish.

805
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:55,640
 We've got two special guests, Greg Jenner, who's the historical consultant for the horrible

806
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:59,800
 history show, and we've got an American comedian called Alex Edelman.

807
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:03,120
 Until then, if you want to talk to us individually about some of the stuff that we set on the show,

808
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:08,640
 you can get me on @Sriberland, James can be got it on @egshaped, and he can be got it on

809
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:14,120
 @andrewhunterm, Anna is still not on Twitter, but if you want to get hold of her, @quickipedia,

810
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:18,120
 she answers all of those from there, or you could head straight away to our new podcast

811
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,120
 page, which is on qi.com/podcast.

812
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,120
 We're going to put up videos.

813
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,600
 We're going to put up pictures from this episode, Extra Facts, links to show you where

814
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,400
 we got some of the information on, there's a lot to play with.

815
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:32,080
 So again, send us your feedback, hopefully you enjoyed it, and we'll see you again next week.

816
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,080
 Good bye.
