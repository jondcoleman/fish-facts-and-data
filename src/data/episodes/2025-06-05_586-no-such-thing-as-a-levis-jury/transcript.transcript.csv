00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:14,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:14,00:00:17,"of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast"
00:00:17,00:00:20,coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.
00:00:20,00:00:21,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:21,00:00:23,"I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:23,00:00:25,Anna Tyshinski and James Harkin.
00:00:25,00:00:28,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:28,00:00:30,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:00:30,00:00:34,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:34,00:00:37,Starting with fact number one and that is Anna.
00:00:37,00:00:41,- My fact this week is that when Socrates lost feeling
00:00:41,00:00:45,"in his penis, he asked his friend to sacrifice a cock."
00:00:45,00:00:46,- Wow.
00:00:46,00:00:49,"- When you say sacrifice is cock, does that mean"
00:00:49,00:00:53,he swaps it over for Socrates as well?
00:00:53,00:00:55,"- Like a battery swap, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:00:55,00:00:56,- Have you rubbed it?
00:00:56,00:00:57,"- Yeah, have you put it in the right way around?"
00:00:57,00:01:00,- It's like a literal auger donor.
00:01:00,00:01:03,- This is very immature wording of a very serious story
00:01:03,00:01:06,about someone who had to commit suicide.
00:01:06,00:01:07,So it's 399 BC.
00:01:07,00:01:09,"- Wow, I didn't actually read the story."
00:01:09,00:01:14,- He was executed by himself.
00:01:14,00:01:15,"- Yeah, I think that is a difference."
00:01:15,00:01:17,"- It is so bizarre, the, yeah,"
00:01:17,00:01:19,I don't know if we do this anymore in any countries
00:01:19,00:01:21,"that the state sentenced him to suicide,"
00:01:21,00:01:23,which I don't know if you can call it suicide
00:01:23,00:01:26,"when the state, but they gave him the hemlock and he took it."
00:01:26,00:01:28,"Anyway, and the effect of it,"
00:01:28,00:01:31,"because he was so hardcore, Socrates,"
00:01:31,00:01:34,"and he was so, had his shit together,"
00:01:34,00:01:36,"hemlock usually had quite violent effects on people,"
00:01:36,00:01:38,"but according to the people around him,"
00:01:38,00:01:40,"with him, it just made him go numb gradually"
00:01:40,00:01:43,"from the feet up, it crept up his legs,"
00:01:43,00:01:46,"and as it reached his groin,"
00:01:46,00:01:48,"the numbness of the hemlock as he was killing himself,"
00:01:48,00:01:51,"according to Plato, he spoke his last words,"
00:01:51,00:01:54,"which were, we owe a rooster to a sclipius,"
00:01:54,00:01:56,"we owe a cock to a sclipius,"
00:01:56,00:01:59,don't forget to pay that debt.
00:01:59,00:01:59,And then he died.
00:01:59,00:02:01,"- And a sclipius was a god,"
00:02:01,00:02:03,this is not a person he had borrowed a cockerel from.
00:02:03,00:02:05,"- Yes, sorry."
00:02:05,00:02:07,- And we should say we're in fourth century Athens.
00:02:07,00:02:08,That's the other thing we should say.
00:02:08,00:02:09,- BC.
00:02:09,00:02:12,"- In context, BC, sorry, fourth century BC Athens,"
00:02:12,00:02:13,a sclipius was the god of healing.
00:02:13,00:02:15,"- Yeah, and the idea is that whenever you were sick"
00:02:15,00:02:19,"and you got better, you sacrificed a cockerel to a sclipius,"
00:02:19,00:02:23,"but he saw his death as a recovery from life almost,"
00:02:23,00:02:25,like he wasn't scared of death was the point.
00:02:25,00:02:27,- It's been cured of the sickness of living.
00:02:27,00:02:29,- It's very cryptic.
00:02:29,00:02:31,"Like, and also you can't ask him,"
00:02:31,00:02:32,what did you mean by that exactly?
00:02:32,00:02:34,"Because he's just, he's literally just died."
00:02:34,00:02:36,"So there are a few theories of,"
00:02:36,00:02:39,or maybe he's making fun of the Pythagoreans
00:02:39,00:02:41,"because they saw cockerels as being sacred,"
00:02:41,00:02:43,or maybe he was alluding to something else.
00:02:43,00:02:45,"But it seems likely that exactly he was saying,"
00:02:45,00:02:48,"actually, life is the illness."
00:02:48,00:02:50,"- Yes, nice."
00:02:50,00:02:51,- Real chin stroker.
00:02:51,00:02:52,"- Well, he was a funny man, wasn't he?"
00:02:52,00:02:53,"- He was a funny guy, yeah."
00:02:53,00:02:57,- There's a big theory that he didn't die of hemlock really.
00:02:57,00:02:58,"I mean, he had died of hemlock,"
00:02:58,00:03:00,but it wasn't the hemlock that made him go numb
00:03:00,00:03:01,because hemlock doesn't make you go numb.
00:03:01,00:03:04,"- No, but as I said, he's a very special man."
00:03:04,00:03:05,- I think the-
00:03:05,00:03:06,- But then there are other theories.
00:03:06,00:03:07,- The suggestion is that he had a lot of opium
00:03:07,00:03:11,mixed in with it to kind of take the edge off a little bit.
00:03:11,00:03:12,- Okay.
00:03:12,00:03:14,- Because there was a guy in the 18th century
00:03:14,00:03:16,described the effects of hemlock.
00:03:16,00:03:18,"And there was a guy called Fergus Cadd,"
00:03:18,00:03:20,"and he was living in the village of Talisca,"
00:03:20,00:03:23,and he mistakenly ate some hemlock roots
00:03:23,00:03:24,thinking it was carrots.
00:03:24,00:03:26,"And he said, his eyes did roll about,"
00:03:26,00:03:28,"his countenance became very pale,"
00:03:28,00:03:30,"his sight had almost failed him,"
00:03:30,00:03:33,"the frame of his body was all in a strange convulsion,"
00:03:33,00:03:36,and his pudenda retired so inwardly
00:03:36,00:03:37,that there was no discerning
00:03:37,00:03:40,whether he had been male or female.
00:03:40,00:03:41,"- Okay, out."
00:03:41,00:03:42,"- But it was quite funny,"
00:03:42,00:03:44,it would make you convulse and stuff.
00:03:44,00:03:45,- Was he all right in the end?
00:03:45,00:03:46,- This guy actually got better.
00:03:46,00:03:48,"They basically, they gave him loads of stuff"
00:03:48,00:03:51,to make him vomit and make him shit himself
00:03:51,00:03:52,"until it all got out of his system,"
00:03:52,00:03:54,and he just about survived.
00:03:54,00:03:55,- What about his pudenda?
00:03:55,00:03:56,(all laughing)
00:03:56,00:03:58,Did they reinflate?
00:03:58,00:03:59,- Not recounted.
00:03:59,00:04:00,(all laughing)
00:04:00,00:04:01,"Don't get the wrong, the important stuff."
00:04:01,00:04:02,- That's interesting about the opium
00:04:02,00:04:04,because that kind of suggested
00:04:04,00:04:05,it's like the equivalent of a last meal
00:04:05,00:04:06,when you're on death row.
00:04:06,00:04:08,"It's like, you're gonna be drinking this,"
00:04:08,00:04:10,what would you like as your mixer?
00:04:10,00:04:11,- Yeah.
00:04:11,00:04:12,- What do you want in there to make it go down nicely
00:04:12,00:04:13,at the end?
00:04:13,00:04:14,- Can I have a hemlock and opium?
00:04:14,00:04:16,"Oh, we've already got Pepsi, is that okay?"
00:04:16,00:04:17,(all laughing)
00:04:17,00:04:20,"- Opium Max, unfortunately."
00:04:20,00:04:22,"- Well, we should say what he was sentenced to death for."
00:04:22,00:04:22,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:04:22,00:04:23,- So.
00:04:23,00:04:24,- Corrupting the youth.
00:04:24,00:04:27,- Corrupting the youth and also impiety.
00:04:27,00:04:30,"And he'd been teaching young people critical thinking,"
00:04:30,00:04:31,"which he was frowned on,"
00:04:31,00:04:34,and he'd also probably not been taking religion
00:04:34,00:04:35,"completely seriously,"
00:04:35,00:04:37,and Athens was a very religious society.
00:04:37,00:04:40,"And also, the other sort of context is like,"
00:04:40,00:04:42,Athens had had this really rough time.
00:04:42,00:04:44,"It was sort of, it was in the golden age of democracy,"
00:04:44,00:04:45,but they'd just been really walloped in a war
00:04:45,00:04:50,"by the Persians, and it was a very rough time."
00:04:50,00:04:52,And there's a theory that people were willing
00:04:52,00:04:53,"to put up with Socrates,"
00:04:53,00:04:56,"who famously asked provocative questions,"
00:04:56,00:04:58,"didn't accept the established version of things,"
00:04:58,00:05:00,"like he was a provocateur, he was a thinker."
00:05:00,00:05:02,And there was a theory that when it was going fine
00:05:02,00:05:04,"for Athens, people were willing to put up with that."
00:05:04,00:05:06,"And then when Athens was really doing badly,"
00:05:06,00:05:09,"people said, ""This is subversive now."
00:05:09,00:05:11,"""So you're gonna have to knock it off."""
00:05:11,00:05:12,- Interesting.
00:05:12,00:05:13,"- He was tried for that, you know?"
00:05:13,00:05:16,"He was tried by a jury, and it was a massive jury."
00:05:16,00:05:19,It's not like you're a classic 12 angry people.
00:05:19,00:05:22,It is 501 jury members.
00:05:22,00:05:23,- The Levi's jury.
00:05:23,00:05:25,- The Levi's jury.
00:05:25,00:05:26,(all laughing)
00:05:26,00:05:27,- Absolutely.
00:05:27,00:05:30,"And it was, the one extra is so that you don't get a tie"
00:05:30,00:05:31,when it comes to the fighting.
00:05:31,00:05:33,"- It'd be bad luck to get 250 all, wouldn't it?"
00:05:33,00:05:34,(all laughing)
00:05:34,00:05:35,- Exactly.
00:05:35,00:05:39,"He ended up with a close margin, 280 voted,"
00:05:39,00:05:41,that he was guilty versus 221.
00:05:41,00:05:42,- It's not that close.
00:05:42,00:05:44,"- Well, I guess it's--"
00:05:44,00:05:46,"- It's thump it in a modern democracy,"
00:05:46,00:05:47,that's a resounding mandate.
00:05:47,00:05:48,"- Okay, well he got thumped."
00:05:48,00:05:52,"Well, what's even crazier is that he lost it, 280 to 221."
00:05:52,00:05:53,That was just to find him guilty.
00:05:53,00:05:55,Then there was another vote to see
00:05:55,00:05:56,what the sentence should be.
00:05:56,00:05:58,"He said, ""Well, I think you should give me"
00:05:58,00:05:59,"""free lunch for life."""
00:05:59,00:06:00,"Like he was a joker, right?"
00:06:00,00:06:03,"That pissed off the members of the jury,"
00:06:03,00:06:05,including jury members who said that he was innocent.
00:06:05,00:06:08,"And even they voted for the death sentence,"
00:06:08,00:06:10,because I was so pissed off by that joke that he made.
00:06:10,00:06:11,- Yeah.
00:06:11,00:06:15,"- I think it's a weird thing to ask the newly guilty party,"
00:06:15,00:06:17,what do you think your punishment should be?
00:06:17,00:06:19,"It's a bit like asking a toddler, isn't it?"
00:06:19,00:06:20,- Yeah.
00:06:20,00:06:21,"- But maybe that was a little bit like twist,"
00:06:21,00:06:24,"playing your own game, Mr. Socrates."
00:06:24,00:06:26,"You're the one always asking us bloody questions,"
00:06:26,00:06:27,rather than giving us answers.
00:06:27,00:06:29,"Well, we'll ask you a question."
00:06:29,00:06:31,- Did anyone vote for the free lunches for life?
00:06:31,00:06:34,(all laughing)
00:06:34,00:06:37,"- To be fair, he did get free lunches for life, probably."
00:06:37,00:06:37,"- Oh, yeah."
00:06:37,00:06:38,"- I mean, I don't imagine he had to pay"
00:06:38,00:06:39,for the hemlock and opium.
00:06:39,00:06:41,"- Maybe it was his clever way of saying,"
00:06:41,00:06:45,"I think I should be put to death in a couple of days,"
00:06:45,00:06:48,but that I should get the food in the prison in that time.
00:06:48,00:06:49,"Like, there was his clever way of saying,"
00:06:49,00:06:50,"yes, put me to death."
00:06:50,00:06:53,"- Yeah, it's gotta be a clever way of saying something,"
00:06:53,00:06:54,"'cause that was what he did, wasn't it?"
00:06:54,00:06:56,"- Well, actually, like, you know what?"
00:06:56,00:06:57,"He was sentenced to death,"
00:06:57,00:07:02,"but then his mates bribed the prison guards and said,"
00:07:02,00:07:03,we'll get you out of here.
00:07:03,00:07:05,"And he said, now you're all right."
00:07:05,00:07:06,- Yeah.
00:07:06,00:07:07,- I'll just take my punishment.
00:07:07,00:07:08,- Really?
00:07:08,00:07:09,- Yeah.
00:07:09,00:07:10,- And his idea was that the law of Athens
00:07:10,00:07:12,didn't protect him all the way through his life.
00:07:12,00:07:14,"And so it would be inconsistent to say,"
00:07:14,00:07:16,"well, now I think that because the laws are against me,"
00:07:16,00:07:18,I shouldn't follow them anymore.
00:07:18,00:07:19,- Bit ungrateful.
00:07:19,00:07:20,- That is good.
00:07:20,00:07:21,And he was 70 as well.
00:07:21,00:07:23,"So going on the Lamb would probably,"
00:07:23,00:07:25,"I mean, just surviving in ancient Greece,"
00:07:25,00:07:27,outside Athens was probably hard.
00:07:27,00:07:29,"- Yeah, he must have been in terrible shape."
00:07:29,00:07:32,"Ancient Greece aged 70, 71."
00:07:32,00:07:33,- Tom Cruise is 63.
00:07:33,00:07:35,So let's put this in context.
00:07:35,00:07:38,Socrates was only a few years older than Tom Cruise is now.
00:07:38,00:07:42,So Socrates's method was really good.
00:07:42,00:07:43,"You know, you'd say,"
00:07:43,00:07:44,"so what do you,"
00:07:44,00:07:45,you just get somewhere into a conversation.
00:07:45,00:07:47,So what do you think about this matter or another?
00:07:47,00:07:48,And they'd say their opinion.
00:07:48,00:07:51,And then he would slowly unravel them.
00:07:51,00:07:52,- Oh yeah.
00:07:52,00:07:52,"- And anytime they said something,"
00:07:52,00:07:53,"he said, well, hang on,"
00:07:53,00:07:56,you said just a moment ago that this other thing was true.
00:07:56,00:07:58,So how can those both be true?
00:07:58,00:08:00,And you would end up with both of you
00:08:00,00:08:01,"in a state of aporia,"
00:08:01,00:08:03,where neither of you can further define the idea
00:08:03,00:08:04,that is under discussion.
00:08:04,00:08:06,And there are lots of anecdotes written about Socrates
00:08:06,00:08:08,getting into conversation with people who end up just saying
00:08:08,00:08:10,"to him, sorry, I have to go."
00:08:10,00:08:12,"I don't, I don't, I have nothing, I have nothing more to say."
00:08:12,00:08:15,- I want my way to work.
00:08:15,00:08:17,- He's basically like a charity mugger outside the station.
00:08:17,00:08:18,So just one minute.
00:08:18,00:08:20,- What do you think of free speech?
00:08:20,00:08:22,- Did he get punched too much?
00:08:22,00:08:23,"Was he, was he ever?"
00:08:23,00:08:25,- I can imagine you're in the groceries
00:08:25,00:08:26,and you're behind Socrates
00:08:26,00:08:29,"and he's questioning the seller, you know."
00:08:29,00:08:30,- Would you punch someone for that?
00:08:30,00:08:34,Maybe try to engage Dan.
00:08:34,00:08:36,- You should see him in the 10 items
00:08:36,00:08:38,off your line.
00:08:38,00:08:40,- What is an item?
00:08:40,00:08:42,That's a bunch of grapes.
00:08:42,00:08:43,Is that one item?
00:08:43,00:08:45,Is that 12 items?
00:08:45,00:08:47,- He did used to cost people in the gym quite a lot
00:08:47,00:08:48,"when they were exercising,"
00:08:48,00:08:50,which maybe isn't a good idea
00:08:50,00:08:52,if you want to avoid being punched.
00:08:52,00:08:55,"- If he was in the gym causing ruckus and starting fights,"
00:08:55,00:08:57,I actually think he would have held up on his own
00:08:57,00:08:58,because we do picture Socrates
00:08:58,00:09:01,as this older philosopher walking around barefooted.
00:09:01,00:09:02,- You know how I picture him?
00:09:02,00:09:05,Exactly how he is in Bill and Ted's excellent adventure.
00:09:05,00:09:06,- Yes.
00:09:06,00:09:08,- And I also pronounce him Socrates
00:09:08,00:09:08,because of the time.
00:09:08,00:09:11,"- Socrates, yeah, exactly."
00:09:11,00:09:12,"We picture him as this philosopher,"
00:09:12,00:09:14,but actually he was a decorated military hero.
00:09:14,00:09:17,He went all the way up to 48.
00:09:17,00:09:18,He was still going to battles.
00:09:18,00:09:20,He was still in front line.
00:09:20,00:09:22,And I just didn't know that about him at all.
00:09:22,00:09:24,I've just had this old man philosopher in my head.
00:09:24,00:09:26,- But it does raise some questions
00:09:26,00:09:28,because so the three main people in his life
00:09:28,00:09:31,"he wrote about him were Aristophanes, Xenophon and Plato."
00:09:31,00:09:33,So a huge amount from Xenophon.
00:09:33,00:09:35,And I hadn't realized he saved Xenophon
00:09:35,00:09:36,in the middle of battle.
00:09:36,00:09:39,So in the Peloponnesian Wars Xenophon was dying.
00:09:39,00:09:40,It's a little bit like the two little boys story.
00:09:40,00:09:42,Xenophon's lying there dying.
00:09:42,00:09:45,"He trots up says, ""Do you think I'd leave you dying?"""
00:09:45,00:09:47,Tosses Xenophon over his shoulder
00:09:47,00:09:49,and carries him out of battle with one hand
00:09:49,00:09:51,while fighting people with the other.
00:09:51,00:09:54,- I thought they both had a wooden horse or something.
00:09:54,00:09:56,"- Yeah, that's the Trojan War you're thinking of."
00:09:56,00:09:58,(laughing)
00:09:58,00:10:01,"- No way, did you just make that joke?"
00:10:01,00:10:02,That's incredible.
00:10:02,00:10:04,What is the two little boys' story?
00:10:04,00:10:05,"- Yes, they start off with a wooden horse"
00:10:05,00:10:08,but you've obviously never made it to verse two
00:10:08,00:10:09,where they go into real battle.
00:10:09,00:10:12,"- Yet they grow up, do they grow apart"
00:10:12,00:10:13,and then they come back together
00:10:13,00:10:14,and one of them saves the other's life.
00:10:14,00:10:17,"- Yeah, it does ring a bell now."
00:10:17,00:10:18,- It's a tear-jerker.
00:10:18,00:10:19,"Anyway, then Xenophon wrote loads of really"
00:10:19,00:10:21,obsequious shit about him for the next 50 years
00:10:21,00:10:23,"but of course he did, he saved his life."
00:10:23,00:10:25,- And we also got a lot from Plato
00:10:25,00:10:27,"'cause these are all his students, right?"
00:10:27,00:10:29,And Plato writes all the really smart things
00:10:29,00:10:31,that Socrates thought.
00:10:31,00:10:34,"But actually, it kind of starts off like that"
00:10:34,00:10:38,"but then towards the end, it's just whatever Plato thinks."
00:10:38,00:10:40,"And he's like, oh, yeah."
00:10:40,00:10:43,"Yeah, Socrates thought that Tremera the best team"
00:10:43,00:10:45,in League Two this season.
00:10:45,00:10:46,Yeah.
00:10:46,00:10:49,"So he's just like, you never know where Socrates ends"
00:10:49,00:10:50,and where Plato starts.
00:10:50,00:10:54,- Is it right that there's no written stuff by Socrates?
00:10:54,00:10:55,There's no record of any of that.
00:10:55,00:10:56,- He hated writing.
00:10:56,00:10:57,- He was against it.
00:10:57,00:11:00,- He thought it would ruin people's memories.
00:11:00,00:11:01,- So it has proved.
00:11:01,00:11:02,"- And the well done hit, called it."
00:11:02,00:11:04,"- In fact, that's the reason that a lot of historians"
00:11:04,00:11:06,apparently really love the Bill and Ted movie
00:11:06,00:11:09,"because in it, you can't understand what he's saying"
00:11:09,00:11:11,and that is very on point with the fact
00:11:11,00:11:13,that we don't know anything that he actually said.
00:11:13,00:11:14,- Right.
00:11:14,00:11:16,- So it's a perfect representation of Socrates.
00:11:16,00:11:17,- Okay.
00:11:17,00:11:20,"- I haven't seen it, but I am gonna counter the claim"
00:11:20,00:11:22,"that it's a perfect representation of Socrates,"
00:11:22,00:11:23,nonetheless.
00:11:23,00:11:23,- Yeah.
00:11:23,00:11:24,- Is that fair?
00:11:24,00:11:25,"- No, not fair."
00:11:25,00:11:26,"- Okay, sorry."
00:11:26,00:11:28,- Most triumphant movie.
00:11:28,00:11:30,- Was there a Mrs. Socrates?
00:11:30,00:11:31,"- Yes, there was."
00:11:31,00:11:32,- Yes.
00:11:32,00:11:34,"- She was called Zanthipe, saying it right."
00:11:34,00:11:35,- Very useful for us at the moment
00:11:35,00:11:38,'cause we're researching the X series of QI.
00:11:38,00:11:39,- Right.
00:11:39,00:11:40,"- As is Xenophon, actually."
00:11:40,00:11:40,- Yes.
00:11:40,00:11:45,- So they had three boys and they lived in near poverty
00:11:45,00:11:47,while Socrates went around the city
00:11:47,00:11:49,asking people weird questions.
00:11:49,00:11:50,Does this remind you of anyone?
00:11:50,00:11:51,(laughing)
00:11:51,00:11:52,- Dad Shriver.
00:11:52,00:11:53,- Three boys.
00:11:53,00:11:54,- Yeah.
00:11:54,00:11:55,"- Yeah, near poverty."
00:11:55,00:11:57,(laughing)
00:11:57,00:11:59,- You're always just going around
00:11:59,00:12:01,"asking people weird questions while Fenn is saying,"
00:12:01,00:12:02,we need to sort out this or that.
00:12:02,00:12:03,- Yes.
00:12:03,00:12:04,"- If Dad's the great philosopher of our time,"
00:12:04,00:12:05,we are really.
00:12:05,00:12:06,(laughing)
00:12:06,00:12:08,- Just another Zanthipe thing.
00:12:08,00:12:10,"This is a mystery that I got too deeply into,"
00:12:10,00:12:11,so I'm gonna drag you down.
00:12:11,00:12:13,Zanthipe was the original Shrew.
00:12:13,00:12:15,She's known throughout medieval history.
00:12:15,00:12:16,She's the Shrewish wife.
00:12:16,00:12:19,She's mentioned in the Taming of the Shrew as the archetype.
00:12:19,00:12:22,And then a Shrew was discovered in the late 19th century
00:12:22,00:12:24,and it was named Zanthipe's Shrew
00:12:24,00:12:26,by the person who discovered it.
00:12:26,00:12:28,Obviously after Zanthipe.
00:12:28,00:12:32,"But get this, its other name is the yellow-footed Shrew."
00:12:32,00:12:34,"Now, as I'm sure you all know,"
00:12:34,00:12:37,"Zanthos in Greek is yellow, golden yellow,"
00:12:37,00:12:41,"and Podes, Pe, Pe, is like feet."
00:12:41,00:12:45,So Zanthipe sort of means yellow-footed
00:12:45,00:12:47,"and it's got yellow feet,"
00:12:47,00:12:49,but it's named after Zanthipe the woman.
00:12:49,00:12:50,What's going on?
00:12:50,00:12:52,- That's amazing.
00:12:52,00:12:53,I got lost halfway through.
00:12:53,00:12:55,- Has anyone followed?
00:12:55,00:12:58,"- So they named it after Zanthipe,"
00:12:58,00:12:59,the woman yellow-footed.
00:12:59,00:13:01,"- No, 'cause she's a Shrewish woman."
00:13:01,00:13:03,"- But if you twist the words a bit,"
00:13:03,00:13:05,it sounds like it's got yellow feet in Greek.
00:13:05,00:13:07,- Exactly. - That's crazy.
00:13:07,00:13:07,That's really good.
00:13:07,00:13:08,"- Thank you, Andy."
00:13:08,00:13:09,- Are you the first person to make that link?
00:13:09,00:13:11,- I think I might be.
00:13:11,00:13:12,- Wow.
00:13:12,00:13:14,"- Yeah, this is going to blow some stuff open."
00:13:14,00:13:16,"- Yeah, let's get in touch with our PR."
00:13:16,00:13:17,Let's get that out there.
00:13:17,00:13:19,(laughing)
00:13:19,00:13:20,- We don't have a PR.
00:13:20,00:13:24,"- Danny Express though, if you're listening."
00:13:24,00:13:28,- I have a favorite Socrates sort of thing that he did.
00:13:28,00:13:30,It's the Socrates freeze.
00:13:30,00:13:31,Did you read about this?
00:13:31,00:13:33,"It's written about, so Plato writes about it"
00:13:33,00:13:34,in the Symposium.
00:13:34,00:13:36,"Basically, he used to get stuck with ideas in his head"
00:13:36,00:13:38,that he really needed to think about.
00:13:38,00:13:40,"And when he did, he just stopped or moved himself"
00:13:40,00:13:42,to a convenient out of the way spot
00:13:42,00:13:44,and just remained there completely still
00:13:44,00:13:45,no matter what he was on his way to.
00:13:45,00:13:48,"So in this, he was on his way to a dinner party"
00:13:48,00:13:49,and he suddenly had an idea.
00:13:49,00:13:52,He just stands on the porch and just stays silent.
00:13:52,00:13:54,And that's how he lived his life.
00:13:54,00:13:57,"When I walk into a room and can't remember why I went in,"
00:13:57,00:13:58,I do the exact same thing.
00:13:58,00:13:59,- You just stop.
00:13:59,00:14:00,"- Just stand there and look around and go,"
00:14:00,00:14:02,what was it I came in here for?
00:14:02,00:14:05,"- Right, maybe you are the great philosopher of our time."
00:14:05,00:14:06,- I think we all know that's true.
00:14:06,00:14:08,- I think that's probably true.
00:14:08,00:14:10,- But you're saying Socrates is standing on that porch
00:14:10,00:14:12,"going, who the fuck's house is this?"
00:14:12,00:14:13,"- Yeah, that's what I reckon."
00:14:13,00:14:16,My favorite Socrates is the--
00:14:16,00:14:18,- I know who it's gonna be.
00:14:18,00:14:20,"- My favorite Socrates, who is it, Anna?"
00:14:20,00:14:21,Do you think?
00:14:21,00:14:22,"- It's gonna be the other famous Socrates in history,"
00:14:22,00:14:23,the football player.
00:14:23,00:14:24,- The footballer.
00:14:24,00:14:25,"- Oh, nice."
00:14:25,00:14:27,- From Brazil in the '80s.
00:14:27,00:14:29,He was known as the smartest player
00:14:29,00:14:31,in the Brazilian football team.
00:14:31,00:14:34,"- Question, was he known as Socrates"
00:14:34,00:14:35,before people thought he was smart?
00:14:35,00:14:37,Or was he called Socrates and then people thought he was--
00:14:37,00:14:39,- He was known as Socrates from a very young age.
00:14:39,00:14:42,"People in Brazil, they'll often get a nickname."
00:14:42,00:14:45,"- But I think actually his dad was a self-taught,"
00:14:45,00:14:46,"very poor but self-taught guy,"
00:14:46,00:14:48,"and he named him Socrates after the philosopher,"
00:14:48,00:14:51,'cause I think his brothers were called Sophocles
00:14:51,00:14:54,and some other very lesser Greek person.
00:14:54,00:14:56,"- Yeah, so his dad was a philosopher,"
00:14:56,00:14:59,"like he studied philosophy, and he had lots of books."
00:14:59,00:15:01,"And basically he was quite sad actually,"
00:15:01,00:15:03,"'cause there was a coup d'etat in Brazil,"
00:15:03,00:15:05,"and when the army came in,"
00:15:05,00:15:08,they forced everyone to burn all their books.
00:15:08,00:15:10,"And Socrates as a child, the footballer,"
00:15:10,00:15:13,he watched his dad burning all the books in his library
00:15:13,00:15:15,"and imagine how painful that was for him,"
00:15:15,00:15:18,"because that was what he loved, he loved his books."
00:15:18,00:15:19,- And did that then turn it onto football?
00:15:19,00:15:21,"He said, ""Well, if I can't read 'cause of this coup,"
00:15:21,00:15:22,"""I'm gonna become a footballer."""
00:15:22,00:15:24,"- No, he was just a great footballer really,"
00:15:24,00:15:26,'cause he also had a medical degree.
00:15:26,00:15:28,- Which he got while he was playing football.
00:15:28,00:15:29,"- Yeah, he was super smart."
00:15:29,00:15:30,- He was amazing.
00:15:30,00:15:32,"- And then when he got towards the end of his career,"
00:15:32,00:15:34,"he got into politics as well,"
00:15:34,00:15:38,"and he said, ""If this military dictatorship doesn't leave"
00:15:38,00:15:39,"""and if they don't allow free elections,"
00:15:39,00:15:42,"""then I'm gonna leave and I'm gonna go and play in Italy."""
00:15:42,00:15:42,- And what happened?
00:15:42,00:15:43,- He went to play in Italy.
00:15:43,00:15:46,"- All right, that's so good, so what a letdown."
00:15:46,00:15:48,"I thought you were gonna say, ""And the government, back down."""
00:15:48,00:15:50,"- So in fairness, they did back down,"
00:15:50,00:15:53,"eventually he played one year in Furentina,"
00:15:53,00:15:55,and then the next year they did back down and he came back.
00:15:55,00:15:57,- But they didn't just abandon the dictatorship
00:15:57,00:15:59,because it's to get him back into the country?
00:15:59,00:16:02,"- No, they didn't, but he was quite instrumental."
00:16:02,00:16:04,"- He was influential, yeah, he was such a big campaigner"
00:16:04,00:16:06,"for all that, he was such a great guy,"
00:16:06,00:16:07,"and he made them all wear shirts saying,"
00:16:07,00:16:09,"""Democracy"" in their big,"
00:16:09,00:16:11,"this is when he played for the Corinthians,"
00:16:11,00:16:15,"which is also really cool because obviously the Corinthians,"
00:16:15,00:16:18,"great allies of Athens, allies of Socrates,"
00:16:18,00:16:19,the Socrates fought with them
00:16:19,00:16:21,and the Peloponnesian Wars.
00:16:21,00:16:23,"- Anna, have you taken Dan's coincidence pills?"
00:16:23,00:16:25,"This is insane, this is insane, I love it."
00:16:25,00:16:33,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy."
00:16:33,00:16:35,- My fact is that a lot of people in the UK
00:16:35,00:16:38,have their heating controlled by BBC Radio 4.
00:16:38,00:16:42,- That is amazing.
00:16:42,00:16:44,"- Seem unlikely, doesn't it?"
00:16:44,00:16:45,- This is mad.
00:16:45,00:16:47,"This, I should say, was sent in as an audience fact,"
00:16:47,00:16:50,"it's sent in by Bill Welch, so thank you, Bill."
00:16:50,00:16:54,"Right, so you will have electricity in your homes, right?"
00:16:54,00:16:56,- Not me with my poverty situation going on.
00:16:56,00:17:00,"I'm out on the streets anyway, so it doesn't matter."
00:17:00,00:17:03,"- So, your electricity is controlled by a meter,"
00:17:03,00:17:05,"and it might be a smart meter if you've had it upgraded,"
00:17:05,00:17:06,"or it might be an old-fashioned one,"
00:17:06,00:17:08,which measures the current going into your home
00:17:08,00:17:10,"and you pay for the amount you use,"
00:17:10,00:17:12,but you also pay maybe a different amount
00:17:12,00:17:13,at different times of day.
00:17:13,00:17:15,"You know, at night, there's more electricity"
00:17:15,00:17:18,"that's going unused, and there's more wind turbines"
00:17:18,00:17:21,"going around, so there's lots of cheap electricity available."
00:17:21,00:17:24,Some old-fashioned electricity meters
00:17:24,00:17:26,"can switch between different tariffs,"
00:17:26,00:17:28,"different rates they're charging you,"
00:17:28,00:17:31,"and the way they do it, switching twice a day,"
00:17:31,00:17:33,is that they are set up to receive a signal
00:17:33,00:17:38,"embedded in the BBC Radio 4 long-wave radio, so it's nuts."
00:17:38,00:17:42,"Twice a day, Radio 4 sends out this message from Droitwich,"
00:17:42,00:17:44,"which is in the middle of the country,"
00:17:44,00:17:46,"and it's a transmitter that can reach the whole country,"
00:17:46,00:17:47,"and it just goes, ""Blip!"""
00:17:47,00:17:50,And hundreds of thousands of homes across the country
00:17:50,00:17:51,switch onto the new tariff
00:17:51,00:17:53,that they're paying for their electricity.
00:17:53,00:17:55,"And this system, it dates back, I think, about 40 years."
00:17:55,00:17:58,"It's only meant to last another month or so,"
00:17:58,00:18:01,"and they're meant to be shutting it down in June 2025,"
00:18:01,00:18:03,"but still, they've got hundreds of thousands of homes"
00:18:03,00:18:05,"where they haven't switched over the meters yet, so..."
00:18:05,00:18:06,- We don't know what's going to happen.
00:18:06,00:18:07,- No. - Yeah.
00:18:07,00:18:08,"- 'Cause at a time of recording,"
00:18:08,00:18:10,they're still going to cut it off.
00:18:10,00:18:11,- I know. - But good luck.
00:18:11,00:18:13,"They are trying to switch people over,"
00:18:13,00:18:14,"but they have to accelerate pretty fast, too, right?"
00:18:14,00:18:16,"- Yeah, switching people over at several thousand a day,"
00:18:16,00:18:18,"or they're trying to. - But it's hard, is it?"
00:18:18,00:18:20,"- It's hard, yeah. - And there is a petition,"
00:18:20,00:18:21,"just in case anyone's listening and thinks,"
00:18:21,00:18:23,"""Hang on, I don't want this to happen on change.org."""
00:18:23,00:18:26,"Do check it out, 'cause it's..."
00:18:26,00:18:28,"Like, I think it's gonna happen."
00:18:28,00:18:29,I think there's time.
00:18:29,00:18:32,"- Yeah, and if you're listening to Radio 4"
00:18:32,00:18:33,"and you're listening out for this noise,"
00:18:33,00:18:35,you're not gonna hear it. - No.
00:18:35,00:18:36,(laughing)
00:18:36,00:18:39,"- Because it's not a bloop, not really."
00:18:39,00:18:44,It's the signal is sent by the phase information of the wave.
00:18:44,00:18:46,So you've got this radio wave sort of pulsing
00:18:46,00:18:49,"through the country, and it's always the same frequency"
00:18:49,00:18:51,so that you can pick it up on your radio.
00:18:51,00:18:54,But if sometimes they put little changes
00:18:54,00:18:57,"in where the peaks and the troughs are in this wave,"
00:18:57,00:19:00,"and those tiny changes are the things that it picks up,"
00:19:00,00:19:03,and your radio would normally strip away
00:19:03,00:19:05,any of those differences.
00:19:05,00:19:08,"Any radio that you own, you would never hear this."
00:19:08,00:19:10,"Now, in theory, you could build a radio,"
00:19:10,00:19:12,"like a ham radio, that would pick it up,"
00:19:12,00:19:13,"but even if you did that,"
00:19:13,00:19:15,it would just be the tiniest little hum
00:19:15,00:19:16,you would have. - Right.
00:19:16,00:19:17,That's interesting.
00:19:17,00:19:21,"So if you are at home, and your radio is off,"
00:19:21,00:19:22,"you've turned off Radio 4,"
00:19:22,00:19:25,"that's, it can't get through the radio, right?"
00:19:25,00:19:26,"Like, that's it, no."
00:19:26,00:19:27,- That's not how radio works.
00:19:27,00:19:29,- Then you pay loads of extra money for heating.
00:19:29,00:19:30,"It's such a stupid system,"
00:19:30,00:19:33,so you don't have to use their radios on all night.
00:19:33,00:19:36,- Your electricity meter is a radio.
00:19:36,00:19:39,"- It contains a tiny little rod with iron in it,"
00:19:39,00:19:40,"and that's an antennae,"
00:19:40,00:19:45,"and that can receive 198 kilohertz radio waves,"
00:19:45,00:19:47,and any signal that comes in on that radio wave
00:19:47,00:19:49,"will be picked up by that little rod,"
00:19:49,00:19:51,and so that is kind of acting like a radio.
00:19:51,00:19:54,- But you can't get a test match special
00:19:54,00:19:55,through your electricity meter.
00:19:55,00:19:57,"- Okay, so if I lean up close,"
00:19:57,00:19:58,I won't hear the arches theme tune.
00:19:58,00:20:00,"Okay, that's good to know."
00:20:00,00:20:02,- A test match special isn't played on radio for anyways.
00:20:02,00:20:03,"- No, it's all right."
00:20:03,00:20:04,- Isn't it?
00:20:04,00:20:05,- They got rid of it a few years ago.
00:20:05,00:20:07,"- Okay, oh my God."
00:20:07,00:20:09,"- I think that's the saddest part of all this stuff actually,"
00:20:09,00:20:12,the test match special isn't on radio for anymore.
00:20:12,00:20:13,"- Right, not even long wave."
00:20:13,00:20:14,"'Cause the reason they put it,"
00:20:14,00:20:16,"like we should say,"
00:20:16,00:20:19,"most people listen to FM all probably now digital, right?"
00:20:19,00:20:21,"But long wave was 'cause there were about 90,000 homes"
00:20:21,00:20:23,"in the country which couldn't get FM radio,"
00:20:23,00:20:25,and you would have to carpet the country with transmitters
00:20:25,00:20:28,to make that signal available absolutely everywhere.
00:20:28,00:20:29,"So for those homes,"
00:20:29,00:20:30,"they just had the long wave signal,"
00:20:30,00:20:32,which it's different that it'd get anywhere.
00:20:32,00:20:35,And also if you then have a program that lasts
00:20:35,00:20:37,"for five days like test match special,"
00:20:37,00:20:39,you just shove it on long wave.
00:20:39,00:20:42,So you don't have to stop all other radio for for a week.
00:20:42,00:20:45,"- But this is why the heating has had to be stopped, right?"
00:20:45,00:20:47,It's not about the heating systems changing over.
00:20:47,00:20:50,It's about radio for saying no one's using long wave anymore.
00:20:50,00:20:52,So also this will be probably news
00:20:52,00:20:55,to maybe five people after the country.
00:20:55,00:20:57,They're stopping broadcasting over long wave.
00:20:57,00:20:58,And this is just the knock on effect
00:20:58,00:20:59,"where these guys are going,"
00:20:59,00:21:01,"""Hang on, that's gonna stop my heating."""
00:21:01,00:21:03,Although it doesn't really affect that many people.
00:21:03,00:21:06,"For instance, if you go to Curry's and try and buy a radio,"
00:21:06,00:21:09,"I think of all the radios they sell in the entire country,"
00:21:09,00:21:10,there's only one of them
00:21:10,00:21:13,that will pick up long wave signals these days.
00:21:13,00:21:14,"- Really, is that true?"
00:21:14,00:21:15,- We're shooting ourselves in the foot
00:21:15,00:21:16,by turning off long wave.
00:21:16,00:21:19,"What about when the internet stops, when it breaks,"
00:21:19,00:21:22,we're gonna need a good reliable backup system
00:21:22,00:21:23,and that can be long wave.
00:21:23,00:21:24,"- Yeah, well, that's probably there, right?"
00:21:24,00:21:25,For us to still use.
00:21:25,00:21:26,"- No, it's not."
00:21:26,00:21:27,This is the weird thing.
00:21:27,00:21:28,The whole point of it
00:21:28,00:21:32,is that they can't get these handmade glass valves.
00:21:32,00:21:33,There are these big glass valves
00:21:33,00:21:35,which make the long wave signal work.
00:21:35,00:21:40,"And the BBC bought the entire global supply some years ago,"
00:21:40,00:21:41,which was 10.
00:21:41,00:21:43,(laughing)
00:21:43,00:21:44,You need two of them
00:21:44,00:21:45,"to make the transmitter work, right?"
00:21:45,00:21:46,- How long did they last?
00:21:46,00:21:48,"- Well, between one and 10 years."
00:21:48,00:21:49,- Okay.
00:21:49,00:21:49,(laughing)
00:21:49,00:21:52,"- You know, so then down to their last two now."
00:21:52,00:21:55,"They've got like, they've got no spares in the cupboard."
00:21:55,00:21:56,They're using their last two valves.
00:21:56,00:21:58,"When one of those goes, the system goes."
00:21:58,00:21:59,- Yeah.
00:21:59,00:22:01,"- One interesting thing about the long wave,"
00:22:01,00:22:03,"especially this thing in Dritewitch is,"
00:22:03,00:22:05,"you have to send out a frequency,"
00:22:05,00:22:09,"and it has to be exactly 198 kilohertz, right?"
00:22:09,00:22:10,But how do you make sure
00:22:10,00:22:12,that the frequency is always the same
00:22:12,00:22:14,when you're sending this signal out?
00:22:14,00:22:15,- Yeah.
00:22:15,00:22:16,- I don't know.
00:22:16,00:22:19,"- Well, they used to have a thing called an SN ring,"
00:22:19,00:22:21,and it was made of quartz.
00:22:21,00:22:23,"And if you apply voltage to quartz,"
00:22:23,00:22:26,it vibrates at a very precise frequency.
00:22:26,00:22:28,"And you had to, it had to be in a perfect ring,"
00:22:28,00:22:31,and you had to sort of hang it up by nylon threads.
00:22:31,00:22:33,(laughing)
00:22:33,00:22:36,"- It's so cool, the technology we used to have."
00:22:36,00:22:39,"- And one of these existed inside the Dritewitch thing,"
00:22:39,00:22:41,so that you would always have the exact frequency.
00:22:41,00:22:43,And now they do it with rubidium.
00:22:43,00:22:46,"So they get some rubidium atoms, like a gas."
00:22:46,00:22:51,"And rubidium atoms, rubidium 87, the isotope,"
00:22:51,00:22:54,they always transition between two energy levels.
00:22:54,00:22:55,"This is quantum physics now,"
00:22:55,00:23:00,which are exactly 6.834682610 gigahertz apart.
00:23:00,00:23:03,And that's basically an atomic clock.
00:23:03,00:23:04,That's what that is.
00:23:04,00:23:06,"- Yeah, 'cause this is how we used to keep time in Paris,"
00:23:06,00:23:08,"wasn't it, with the quartz before they came up"
00:23:08,00:23:09,with the better version?
00:23:09,00:23:10,- Absolutely.
00:23:10,00:23:11,That's how my cassio works.
00:23:11,00:23:12,- Yes.
00:23:12,00:23:13,(laughing)
00:23:13,00:23:14,"- Actually, I'm not even joking,"
00:23:14,00:23:16,it has a small piece of quartz in.
00:23:16,00:23:17,That's how a digital watch.
00:23:17,00:23:19,- So yours works in the same way
00:23:19,00:23:20,that the SN ring would work.
00:23:20,00:23:22,"Obviously, you don't have rubidium atoms in there."
00:23:22,00:23:23,- I didn't spring for that.
00:23:23,00:23:25,"I saw it on Amazon as an option,"
00:23:25,00:23:26,"it's like, but it was three quid more."
00:23:26,00:23:27,"And I thought, no, stuff that."
00:23:27,00:23:30,"- But the atomic clock inside Droughtwitch,"
00:23:30,00:23:33,"not lose more than one second every 3,000 years,"
00:23:33,00:23:36,"if it was a watch, which is pretty good."
00:23:36,00:23:38,"Although we're now up to with atomic clocks,"
00:23:38,00:23:41,ones that won't lose a second in 30 billion years.
00:23:41,00:23:43,"- Yeah, we've got two perfectionists here, haven't we?"
00:23:43,00:23:45,It's like having to find the next digit of pi.
00:23:45,00:23:46,- Yeah.
00:23:46,00:23:47,- Who cares?
00:23:47,00:23:47,We've gone far enough.
00:23:47,00:23:49,"- A second every 3,000 years is still,"
00:23:49,00:23:52,if you'd started that when we invented farming
00:23:52,00:23:54,"and came to now, it would still be within three seconds,"
00:23:54,00:23:56,which I think is good.
00:23:56,00:23:57,I think that's good.
00:23:57,00:23:59,- Socrates would be almost a second late
00:23:59,00:24:00,if you had a meeting with him.
00:24:00,00:24:02,"- It doesn't matter, he's frozen half a mile"
00:24:02,00:24:03,down the road anyway.
00:24:03,00:24:05,(laughing)
00:24:05,00:24:10,- I had to refresh my memory from the old GCSE
00:24:10,00:24:12,in physics of how on earth all these waves bloody work.
00:24:12,00:24:17,"And so, in case you need it, long wave hugs the ground,"
00:24:17,00:24:19,which I just like the idea that that's why it can get
00:24:19,00:24:20,"to all of those places is that,"
00:24:20,00:24:23,like some sort of weird cartoon character
00:24:23,00:24:25,just clings just above the ground
00:24:25,00:24:28,so it can gallop over mountains and humps and everything.
00:24:28,00:24:30,"- So if you're in a valley, you still get it?"
00:24:30,00:24:31,- Exactly.
00:24:31,00:24:34,- Is it bouncing off the sky?
00:24:34,00:24:35,"- Sometimes it is, but more important"
00:24:35,00:24:37,with the bouncing of the sky.
00:24:37,00:24:39,"And I think this is the very cool thing,"
00:24:39,00:24:41,is short wave reception.
00:24:41,00:24:44,"So short wave relies on the ionosphere,"
00:24:44,00:24:49,which is the ring in our atmosphere of charged ions.
00:24:49,00:24:52,And the reason they're charged is because the sunlight
00:24:52,00:24:55,bashes into atoms in the daytime in our atmosphere
00:24:55,00:24:56,and it causes them all to react with each other
00:24:56,00:24:58,and lose electrons and they become ions.
00:24:58,00:25:00,So it's all very electrically charged.
00:25:00,00:25:02,And we use that ionosphere short wave
00:25:02,00:25:06,to bounce radio signal up and then back down to us.
00:25:06,00:25:08,What I quite like about that is that that means
00:25:08,00:25:12,that you'd get much better reception at night on the radio
00:25:12,00:25:14,just because of how the ionosphere works.
00:25:14,00:25:17,"So basically in the daytime,"
00:25:17,00:25:19,the ionosphere has been all charged up by the sun.
00:25:19,00:25:22,"So it's lots of ions, like free electrons,"
00:25:22,00:25:24,wandering around looking for a partner.
00:25:24,00:25:26,"And so the radio wave goes up,"
00:25:26,00:25:29,like someone going into a ballroom full of dancers
00:25:29,00:25:30,looking for partners.
00:25:30,00:25:31,"- The sexy stuff, yeah, yeah."
00:25:31,00:25:32,- Yeah.
00:25:32,00:25:34,And it's harder in the daytime to get through that ballroom
00:25:34,00:25:36,because the dancers keep on trying to dance with you.
00:25:36,00:25:38,"They're these free ions being like,"
00:25:38,00:25:40,"""Hey, pair up with me, pair up with me."""
00:25:40,00:25:42,"But in the nighttime, they all chill out,"
00:25:42,00:25:44,they recombine with their normal partners
00:25:44,00:25:46,'cause the sunlight's gone away and stopped stirring them up.
00:25:46,00:25:48,So the radio signal of your short wave radio
00:25:48,00:25:50,can just go straight through the dance floor
00:25:50,00:25:53,without anyone assaulting them for it.
00:25:53,00:25:54,"- Which is all well and good,"
00:25:54,00:25:57,but you can't play cricket at the nighttime.
00:25:57,00:26:00,So the terrible irony is you can never listen
00:26:00,00:26:02,"to ""Test Met Special"" with a good signal."
00:26:02,00:26:04,- And that is the ultimate point is it's pointless.
00:26:04,00:26:07,What good radios on a three in the morning?
00:26:07,00:26:09,"- ""Droit Witch"" played a part in D-Day."
00:26:09,00:26:10,- Did it?
00:26:10,00:26:12,"- Yes, it did."
00:26:12,00:26:15,"- The D in D-Day stands for ""Droit Witch"" day, yeah."
00:26:15,00:26:19,The date of the landings was broadcast
00:26:19,00:26:21,"from the ""Droit Witch"" transmitter"
00:26:21,00:26:24,"because there were people in France, the resistance,"
00:26:24,00:26:26,they were getting signals from Britain
00:26:26,00:26:28,and how do you send a signal all the way to France?
00:26:28,00:26:29,"Well, it's pretty difficult"
00:26:29,00:26:32,unless you have a big old tower that can send long wave.
00:26:32,00:26:33,And so they did and they could pick up
00:26:33,00:26:36,the BBC French service from there
00:26:36,00:26:39,"and they played like a poem by Paul Vellan, I think."
00:26:39,00:26:41,"And when they heard that poem,"
00:26:41,00:26:43,"they knew that this was the time to,"
00:26:43,00:26:46,basically what they did was they would kind of cause ruckus
00:26:46,00:26:48,"with the Germans and like, you know,"
00:26:48,00:26:49,just be a pain in the arse.
00:26:49,00:26:50,"- If you're gonna block the roadways,"
00:26:50,00:26:51,blow them up now.
00:26:51,00:26:52,"- Yeah, exactly, yeah, yeah."
00:26:52,00:26:55,"Just keep them occupied in various,"
00:26:55,00:26:56,"oh, ironically, you're the one who's occupied,"
00:26:56,00:27:01,but keep them occupied while we're going onto the beaches.
00:27:01,00:27:03,"- So the signal was like, create a distraction."
00:27:03,00:27:04,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:27:04,00:27:05,- Cool.
00:27:05,00:27:05,- Can we say what the line was?
00:27:05,00:27:06,It's so cool.
00:27:06,00:27:08,"So as you said, James, it was a poem by Paul Vellan"
00:27:08,00:27:11,"who was a 19th century, quite avant-garde gay poet."
00:27:11,00:27:12,"Like, he was quite--"
00:27:12,00:27:15,"- Was he the one who had an affair with Rambo, I think?"
00:27:15,00:27:16,- I think he did.
00:27:16,00:27:17,"- Not Rambo, the--"
00:27:17,00:27:18,(laughing)
00:27:18,00:27:19,- That's looking interesting.
00:27:19,00:27:20,- I was told me more.
00:27:20,00:27:21,Who's Rambo?
00:27:21,00:27:23,- Arthur Rambo was the poet as well.
00:27:23,00:27:24,Yeah.
00:27:24,00:27:25,"- Oh, God."
00:27:25,00:27:26,- They were like the romantic poets of France.
00:27:26,00:27:27,"- Yeah, they were terrific."
00:27:27,00:27:29,- That's a disappointing movie night
00:27:29,00:27:31,when I've rented that movie.
00:27:31,00:27:32,"- Rambo, First Blood."
00:27:32,00:27:33,(laughing)
00:27:33,00:27:36,"- Actually, Total Eclipse starring Leonardo DiCaprio"
00:27:36,00:27:38,"as Rambo is a great film, Dan."
00:27:38,00:27:38,- Wow.
00:27:38,00:27:40,"- Yeah, there you go."
00:27:40,00:27:41,- And so the poem starts.
00:27:41,00:27:45,(speaking in foreign language)
00:27:45,00:27:48,"""The long sobs of autumn violins"
00:27:48,00:27:51,"""wound my heart with a monotonous langer."""
00:27:51,00:27:52,Very poetic.
00:27:52,00:27:54,"So when they broadcast the first half,"
00:27:54,00:27:56,that was a signal to the French resistance.
00:27:56,00:27:57,Invasion's gonna be within two weeks.
00:27:57,00:27:59,You've got two weeks to get ready.
00:27:59,00:27:59,- Right.
00:27:59,00:28:01,"- And then they broadcast the second half of that line,"
00:28:01,00:28:03,"which was, you've got 48 hours."
00:28:03,00:28:05,"Like, the French service broadcast all of these phrases,"
00:28:05,00:28:07,"some of which were meaningful,"
00:28:07,00:28:10,"like, ""Molas's tomorrow will bring forth cognac."""
00:28:10,00:28:12,"That just went into France,"
00:28:12,00:28:14,"as it might've been done in Morse code,"
00:28:14,00:28:15,but it was- - Okay.
00:28:15,00:28:18,"- And then, ""John has a long moustache."""
00:28:18,00:28:20,"And some of these phrases were meaningful to the resistance,"
00:28:20,00:28:22,"and a lot of them were nonsense,"
00:28:22,00:28:23,"just to confuse the Germans, basically."
00:28:23,00:28:25,"- How interesting, right, cool, that's clever."
00:28:25,00:28:26,- And the Germans knew the significance
00:28:26,00:28:27,of the Verland poem.
00:28:27,00:28:30,"There was an officer, a German intelligence officer,"
00:28:30,00:28:33,"who said, ""Okay, the invasion's coming within 48 hours."""
00:28:33,00:28:34,"And he passed the message on,"
00:28:34,00:28:36,but it did not get through to the army
00:28:36,00:28:38,"who were actually in charge of Normandy,"
00:28:38,00:28:41,and trying to man the beaches.
00:28:41,00:28:42,- Did he go shortwave?
00:28:42,00:28:43,- I didn't. - Grewed it up.
00:28:43,00:28:45,"- Yeah, the warning wasn't passed on."
00:28:45,00:28:46,"- That's mad, really."
00:28:46,00:28:48,"- It's huge, that's a big counterfactual."
00:28:48,00:28:51,"- Well, the amazing thing is also the Germans"
00:28:51,00:28:53,sent some signals from Droitwich as well.
00:28:53,00:28:56,"- Did they? - They had someone on the inside,"
00:28:56,00:28:58,and so they could use the Droitwich transmitter
00:28:58,00:29:01,to send their own signals to people in France.
00:29:01,00:29:03,"- Right, there was a German spy in Droitwich."
00:29:03,00:29:04,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:29:04,00:29:05,"- They don't know who it was,"
00:29:05,00:29:07,they assume it was someone working at the BBC or something.
00:29:07,00:29:09,"- That's crazy. - Wow, that's cool."
00:29:09,00:29:11,"I like that Longwave can go through water as well,"
00:29:11,00:29:13,and that was submarines would use Longwave
00:29:13,00:29:15,"to get their radio, their Radio 4,"
00:29:15,00:29:17,they would literally use to get it.
00:29:17,00:29:19,"- I think they still do. - Yeah, they still do,"
00:29:19,00:29:21,"but obviously at the end of this month, they weren't, right?"
00:29:21,00:29:22,- What are they gonna do?
00:29:22,00:29:24,"- I don't know, I don't obviously got a new thing,"
00:29:24,00:29:26,"they're gonna swap too, but that was the thing,"
00:29:26,00:29:28,"I'm sure we've said it, where in wartime,"
00:29:28,00:29:31,"you would make sure that England was still there,"
00:29:31,00:29:33,"basically, while you were under water,"
00:29:33,00:29:34,if Radio 4 was still going.
00:29:34,00:29:37,- They've probably gone BBC sounds now.
00:29:37,00:29:40,"- That's true, they probably pre-download before they go."
00:29:40,00:29:43,(all laughing)
00:29:43,00:29:44,"I do love codes in,"
00:29:44,00:29:45,"I feel like we should do this at some point,"
00:29:45,00:29:47,there's a whole period of an American radio
00:29:47,00:29:50,where they would put a code for the listener
00:29:50,00:29:51,"at the end of a radio show,"
00:29:51,00:29:53,"so it would be like a little bit of Morse code,"
00:29:53,00:29:56,"and you had a decoder at home as part of the fan club,"
00:29:56,00:29:58,so we would give little teasers for what's happening
00:29:58,00:29:59,in the episode that you were gonna hear
00:29:59,00:30:00,the next day or the next week.
00:30:00,00:30:01,"- That's a really good idea,"
00:30:01,00:30:04,'cause we know that you listening to this
00:30:04,00:30:06,almost certainly stop listening
00:30:06,00:30:09,"before we say our email address is at the end,"
00:30:09,00:30:10,"'cause we've seen the figures,"
00:30:10,00:30:12,we know when the drop-off comes.
00:30:12,00:30:14,- Are you saying we should put them in Morse code
00:30:14,00:30:15,at the start of the podcast?
00:30:15,00:30:17,"- No, I'm saying we put something special at the very end,"
00:30:17,00:30:20,"so people are forced to listen to us saying,"
00:30:20,00:30:21,I'm on Instagram.
00:30:21,00:30:24,"- All right, we're gonna do it,"
00:30:24,00:30:26,we can just tell people we'll put something special in.
00:30:26,00:30:27,- What should we put?
00:30:27,00:30:27,Crossword?
00:30:27,00:30:31,"- That's the most, that's the most fun,"
00:30:31,00:30:32,I think I've ever heard of.
00:30:32,00:30:33,- What about Sudoku?
00:30:33,00:30:34,- A Sudoku.
00:30:34,00:30:37,"- So I'll do the first box, blank."
00:30:37,00:30:38,(all laughing)
00:30:38,00:30:40,You're gonna listen next week.
00:30:40,00:30:42,"- In just 81 episodes time,"
00:30:42,00:30:45,you've made your own Sudoku credit.
00:30:45,00:30:46,- That's great.
00:30:46,00:30:48,- This'll get people listening.
00:30:48,00:30:51,(upbeat music)
00:30:51,00:30:56,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:30:56,00:30:57,and that is my fact.
00:30:57,00:31:00,My fact this week is that Andy Warhol
00:31:00,00:31:03,would regularly have his wig cut by a barber
00:31:03,00:31:05,and then return the following month
00:31:05,00:31:07,wearing a new longer wig.
00:31:07,00:31:09,"- Sorry, annoying for that barber."
00:31:09,00:31:11,"- Yeah, how did the barber react?"
00:31:11,00:31:13,"- Well, this is Andy Warhol we're talking about."
00:31:13,00:31:15,"He, as well as being an artist,"
00:31:15,00:31:17,"was an art piece in himself,"
00:31:17,00:31:18,and the barber would have known
00:31:18,00:31:20,and would have enjoyed what they were doing.
00:31:20,00:31:23,"- And actually, at the moment, if you're a barber,"
00:31:23,00:31:24,you have to sit there waiting
00:31:24,00:31:27,"for your customers to grow hair,"
00:31:27,00:31:29,"but if they just come in and buy some hair for you to cut,"
00:31:29,00:31:31,it's giving you more work.
00:31:31,00:31:32,"- Yeah, that's a good point."
00:31:32,00:31:34,"- Yeah, was it so that his friends"
00:31:34,00:31:39,would kind of slowly see his wig get longer and shorter
00:31:39,00:31:40,so it looked more realistic?
00:31:40,00:31:41,"- Yeah, I think as well,"
00:31:41,00:31:43,like this is one of the most photographed
00:31:43,00:31:45,socialites in America at the time.
00:31:45,00:31:48,He wanted to make sure that his look was ever changing.
00:31:48,00:31:50,It was sort of in fashion.
00:31:50,00:31:52,"The wig was a huge part of his life, by the way."
00:31:52,00:31:54,"- 'Cause his wig is a very obvious wig,"
00:31:54,00:31:55,"Andy Warhol's, isn't it?"
00:31:55,00:31:57,"- Yeah, it's silvery, isn't it?"
00:31:57,00:31:59,I know you had hundreds of wigs.
00:31:59,00:32:02,"- But iconic, so he basically started going bold"
00:32:02,00:32:05,"when he was in his 20s, and he really didn't want this."
00:32:05,00:32:07,And there's a lot of early art pieces
00:32:07,00:32:09,where it clearly is playing on his mind.
00:32:09,00:32:11,"There's a piece that he did called ""Bold?"""
00:32:11,00:32:14,"Question mark, where he just showed"
00:32:14,00:32:16,someone gradually becoming bold in sketches.
00:32:16,00:32:18,And so he took it very seriously.
00:32:18,00:32:21,And there's a huge collection of Andy Warhol wigs
00:32:21,00:32:22,that are out there now.
00:32:22,00:32:25,They were all very nicely made by a man
00:32:25,00:32:28,who was called Paul Bokiccio.
00:32:28,00:32:29,They were iconic wigs.
00:32:29,00:32:32,"- Yeah, you could buy one in 2006 at auction"
00:32:32,00:32:35,"for $10,800 at which time it was"
00:32:35,00:32:37,the most expensive wig ever sold.
00:32:37,00:32:38,"- Oh yeah, has it been overtaken?"
00:32:38,00:32:40,"- Three times, do you wanna guess?"
00:32:40,00:32:41,"- Oh, yes."
00:32:41,00:32:42,- Who's Big Wigs?
00:32:42,00:32:43,- You can get them all.
00:32:43,00:32:44,- Big Wigs.
00:32:44,00:32:47,- Marge Simpson?
00:32:47,00:32:48,- Oh my God.
00:32:48,00:32:51,Let's try some real life people.
00:32:51,00:32:52,"- Okay, okay."
00:32:52,00:32:55,- But Big Wigs is a good name for when I turn this
00:32:55,00:32:56,into a channel five format.
00:32:56,00:32:57,"- Yeah, absolutely."
00:32:57,00:32:58,- I'll take my usual 10% fee.
00:32:58,00:33:00,"- Yeah, I feel like we might struggle"
00:33:00,00:33:01,after the first episode.
00:33:01,00:33:03,"In fact, after the first question."
00:33:03,00:33:04,(all laughing)
00:33:04,00:33:06,"- I'm struggling now, I think I'm really famous."
00:33:06,00:33:07,"So I'm thinking of people,"
00:33:07,00:33:10,I'm thinking of iconic weird artists like
00:33:10,00:33:10,Salvador Dali.
00:33:10,00:33:12,"- I think I'm more famous, very famous."
00:33:12,00:33:14,- Edna Everage?
00:33:14,00:33:15,- Edna Everage.
00:33:15,00:33:16,- Really good call.
00:33:16,00:33:17,Michael Jackson.
00:33:17,00:33:20,"- Michael Jackson in at one, $75,000."
00:33:20,00:33:21,- Where's his wig?
00:33:21,00:33:22,- Where's his wig?
00:33:22,00:33:24,- He did wear wigs later on.
00:33:24,00:33:26,So he was in a commercial for Pepsi.
00:33:26,00:33:27,- Yeah.
00:33:27,00:33:30,- And there was a fire or he burnt his hair basically
00:33:30,00:33:32,and he had to wear wigs for a while after that.
00:33:32,00:33:33,- It was pyrotechnics that went wrong
00:33:33,00:33:36,during the advert recording and his head lit up.
00:33:36,00:33:37,He didn't even notice.
00:33:37,00:33:39,You can see the footage where he's still dancing
00:33:39,00:33:41,"and his head is just in, yeah."
00:33:41,00:33:42,"Oh, so that's number one."
00:33:42,00:33:44,"- Are the famous wig wearers, so?"
00:33:44,00:33:47,- Go for more famous people who might have happened
00:33:47,00:33:49,to have worn wigs at a certain time.
00:33:49,00:33:50,- Dolly Parton.
00:33:50,00:33:51,"- Close, but no."
00:33:51,00:33:53,"- Give us one, like one clue that's sort of like."
00:33:53,00:33:56,- The most famous woman of the 20th century.
00:33:56,00:33:57,- Marilyn Monroe.
00:33:57,00:33:59,- Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor.
00:33:59,00:34:01,"- Oh, double."
00:34:01,00:34:02,- Yeah.
00:34:02,00:34:05,You kind of spoiled the format by getting them so quickly.
00:34:05,00:34:07,Fill another 24 minutes of the show.
00:34:07,00:34:11,"But it was Elizabeth Taylor's wig in ""Clear Patra"""
00:34:11,00:34:15,"went for $16,000 and Marilyn Monroe's wig,"
00:34:15,00:34:18,"she wore in ""The Misfits,"" which was her last film."
00:34:18,00:34:20,"I went for $30,000."
00:34:20,00:34:21,- Nice.
00:34:21,00:34:23,"- ♪ Da, da, da, da, da ♪"
00:34:23,00:34:27,- Come back next week when we'll desperately be hoping
00:34:27,00:34:29,for some big news in the wig world.
00:34:29,00:34:31,(laughing)
00:34:31,00:34:34,"- So he kept hundreds, didn't he, Andy Warhol?"
00:34:34,00:34:36,In boxes and--
00:34:36,00:34:37,"- Yeah, he was a huge hoarder."
00:34:37,00:34:39,- He collected everything in his life.
00:34:39,00:34:40,"There's a weird, massive art."
00:34:40,00:34:42,I think there's an Andy Warhol museum somewhere.
00:34:42,00:34:44,"Maybe it's in Pittsburgh, which is where he was from."
00:34:44,00:34:45,- Yeah.
00:34:45,00:34:46,"- But it's got, wherever it is,"
00:34:46,00:34:49,"it's got 50,000 of his things or 100,000, you know,"
00:34:49,00:34:52,sort of many floors of ticket stubs and old.
00:34:52,00:34:53,"- He basically, at the end of every day,"
00:34:53,00:34:55,he would get a big cardboard box
00:34:55,00:34:57,"and anything that he had left over,"
00:34:57,00:35:00,"like half a sandwich or a smoke cigarette or something,"
00:35:00,00:35:02,he would just pour it all into that box
00:35:02,00:35:05,and with market time capsule
00:35:05,00:35:06,and then just put it to one side.
00:35:06,00:35:07,- It's a good idea.
00:35:07,00:35:09,- And the Andy Warhol museum has hundreds of these
00:35:09,00:35:11,and I don't think they've all been opened.
00:35:11,00:35:13,"- No, so back in 2007, there was a journalist"
00:35:13,00:35:16,who was invited to see some of the boxes being opened.
00:35:16,00:35:19,So they had 600 boxes of these things.
00:35:19,00:35:21,I think only like 80 of them had been opened at that point
00:35:21,00:35:23,and they had just no idea what you'd find in it.
00:35:23,00:35:24,So he was there as they opened it
00:35:24,00:35:27,and they found an unopened Lionel Richie CD
00:35:27,00:35:31,"and you know, but then they found things"
00:35:31,00:35:34,"like a mummified foot that he bought at a sort of sale,"
00:35:34,00:35:37,"you know, like a garage sale and that he kept in."
00:35:37,00:35:39,"- This is a format James, I'm sorry,"
00:35:39,00:35:42,but like when the wig show comes to the end
00:35:42,00:35:44,"of its natural life after many seasons,"
00:35:44,00:35:48,"I think Andy Warhol's big box open is a good,"
00:35:48,00:35:50,it's like storage walls where you bid against each other
00:35:50,00:35:52,for what's in a box and you might get a half-eaten sandwich
00:35:52,00:35:55,"or you might get millions of flies, you know?"
00:35:55,00:35:57,That's a fun concept.
00:35:57,00:35:59,Are any of them like moving or ticking or?
00:35:59,00:36:01,(laughing)
00:36:01,00:36:05,- It's very much something you can get away with
00:36:05,00:36:07,if you're a very famous artist.
00:36:07,00:36:08,"But if I did that as an ordinary human being,"
00:36:08,00:36:10,my friends would think I'd gone completely mad.
00:36:10,00:36:12,- It's unsustainable for all eight billion of us
00:36:12,00:36:13,to do this with all of our things.
00:36:13,00:36:19,- But also the wig became its own thing in his life
00:36:19,00:36:20,where it could act as him.
00:36:20,00:36:23,So there was a whole tour in colleges
00:36:23,00:36:26,"and instead of going, he sent an actor."
00:36:26,00:36:27,"I think the guy had his own hair,"
00:36:27,00:36:29,but he cut it and he colored it to exactly Andy Warhol.
00:36:29,00:36:32,So iconic that look and he wore dark glasses.
00:36:32,00:36:33,- Can we say what he was called?
00:36:33,00:36:34,"- Yeah, absolutely."
00:36:34,00:36:35,- He was called Alan Midget.
00:36:35,00:36:36,"- Yeah, Midget."
00:36:36,00:36:38,- I'm so sorry for mispronouncing
00:36:38,00:36:39,something for comic effect.
00:36:39,00:36:41,(laughing)
00:36:41,00:36:42,- Alan Midget.
00:36:42,00:36:45,"- He had an E at the end, but he put that E on."
00:36:45,00:36:47,It didn't have the originally.
00:36:47,00:36:48,"- Yeah, thank you very much."
00:36:48,00:36:51,- And basically people were very annoyed with Andy Warhol
00:36:51,00:36:54,when they found out that he'd sent Alan Midget in his place
00:36:54,00:36:56,just like sunglasses in a wig.
00:36:56,00:36:57,- Yeah.
00:36:57,00:36:59,- Did they know straight away when he came up
00:36:59,00:37:00,or would they see the whole tour?
00:37:00,00:37:02,- Basically they screened an incredibly boring film
00:37:02,00:37:03,that Andy Warhol had shot.
00:37:03,00:37:05,And then Andy Warhol's shtick
00:37:05,00:37:06,was that he didn't answer any questions.
00:37:06,00:37:08,So you'd have a question and answer session
00:37:08,00:37:10,where you'd say like two word answers.
00:37:10,00:37:12,I think people did get pretty quickly.
00:37:12,00:37:13,- They eventually did get it.
00:37:13,00:37:15,And it was a bit confusing.
00:37:15,00:37:16,"And the people around Andy would say,"
00:37:16,00:37:17,isn't it fascinating?
00:37:17,00:37:19,Some people who'd even met Andy
00:37:19,00:37:22,"would then meet Paul Midget and say,"
00:37:22,00:37:24,"wow, Andy, lovely to see you again."
00:37:24,00:37:25,"And he was like, if enough people around a person"
00:37:25,00:37:27,"believe it is the person,"
00:37:27,00:37:29,then they get confused into thinking it is.
00:37:29,00:37:30,And that was the case.
00:37:30,00:37:31,Andy said they got a better deal
00:37:31,00:37:34,because actually Midget gave more answers at the talks
00:37:34,00:37:35,than Andy would have.
00:37:35,00:37:36,He was more personable.
00:37:36,00:37:37,He was more likable.
00:37:37,00:37:38,- Supposedly he was caught
00:37:38,00:37:40,when he ran out of silver hairspray.
00:37:40,00:37:42,"Alan Midget, I don't know if that's true."
00:37:42,00:37:44,And people were so annoyed about this when it was discovered
00:37:44,00:37:46,that one Oregon college made Andy Warhol swear
00:37:46,00:37:48,on a Bible that he was Andy Warhol
00:37:48,00:37:50,before they let him do the event.
00:37:50,00:37:53,"'Cause it was to students, these talks, basically."
00:37:53,00:37:54,And I think people had...
00:37:54,00:37:56,- But it feels better to see the double
00:37:56,00:37:58,because you're seeing an Andy Warhol work of art.
00:37:58,00:38:02,"As Dan says, Andy Warhol made himself a work of art, didn't he?"
00:38:02,00:38:04,"So it was like everything he did, you had to appreciate."
00:38:04,00:38:06,And some people didn't get it.
00:38:06,00:38:08,- This guy is the Socrates of the 20th century.
00:38:08,00:38:11,"I'm sorry, he's going around irritating people."
00:38:11,00:38:13,"- Not answering any questions, only asking them."
00:38:13,00:38:16,"- Yeah, he was a weird guy."
00:38:16,00:38:18,"He did a lot of art, which was about replication"
00:38:18,00:38:20,and uniformity.
00:38:20,00:38:22,And so one of his most famous things
00:38:22,00:38:24,is the paintings of Campbell's soup can.
00:38:24,00:38:26,"- Yeah, that's what made him famous, really, yeah."
00:38:26,00:38:30,"- But this was 1962, and it was his first big solo show."
00:38:30,00:38:32,So it was his debut to the art world.
00:38:32,00:38:33,It was not a success.
00:38:33,00:38:35,He sold five.
00:38:35,00:38:36,- Really? - Yeah.
00:38:36,00:38:38,"In fact, I don't even know if he sold five."
00:38:38,00:38:40,"Like a few of the, two were sold and a few more,"
00:38:40,00:38:41,"someone said, ""Yeah, keep that back for me."""
00:38:41,00:38:43,"You know, it was a failure, I would say."
00:38:43,00:38:45,"And the gallery owner then said,"
00:38:45,00:38:46,"""Actually, I'm not going to sell any of these."
00:38:46,00:38:48,"""I want to keep the series together."""
00:38:48,00:38:49,But I think it's interesting
00:38:49,00:38:52,"that Campbell's didn't know about it,"
00:38:52,00:38:55,because obviously he wouldn't have worn them or anything.
00:38:55,00:38:58,But then people started wearing Campbell's soup clothing
00:38:58,00:39:00,because this work of art had become popular.
00:39:00,00:39:02,And then Campbell's soup gave him a commission
00:39:02,00:39:04,to paint a can because their chairman was retiring.
00:39:04,00:39:06,So they've got this weird relationship.
00:39:06,00:39:08,Then they threatened to sue him later on.
00:39:08,00:39:12,Then they made their own dress out of soup can labels.
00:39:12,00:39:15,"If you sent them $1 and two labels,"
00:39:15,00:39:16,they would send you a dress
00:39:16,00:39:17,that looks like Campbell's soup can labels.
00:39:17,00:39:20,"- Oh, so it was for anyway, it wasn't like high fashion."
00:39:20,00:39:21,"- No, no, no."
00:39:21,00:39:22,It was just a sort of an offer.
00:39:22,00:39:23,"But it was based on-- - Oh, $1."
00:39:23,00:39:24,That's a great value of dress.
00:39:24,00:39:25,- And two labels.
00:39:25,00:39:26,(laughing)
00:39:26,00:39:27,It's still a great value of dress.
00:39:27,00:39:30,But he just sort of dragged this perfectly innocent soup company
00:39:30,00:39:32,into the world of high art.
00:39:32,00:39:34,And then they started engaging with it off the back of it.
00:39:34,00:39:34,"It was very much. - You may ask,"
00:39:34,00:39:35,"you might not know this,"
00:39:35,00:39:37,"but if that was such a failure,"
00:39:37,00:39:40,at what stage did he become not a failure?
00:39:40,00:39:41,Do you know what I mean?
00:39:41,00:39:42,- I think it was very soon after that.
00:39:42,00:39:44,- I think it was almost the day after that.
00:39:44,00:39:45,"- I think it's connected, yeah."
00:39:45,00:39:47,- A lot of people thought all the soup thing don't know.
00:39:47,00:39:49,"And then a few critics said, actually, this is great."
00:39:49,00:39:50,"- Actually, it's pretty good, yeah."
00:39:50,00:39:53,"- Yeah, which I'm still on the fence about."
00:39:53,00:39:54,(laughing)
00:39:54,00:39:56,"Some other people who don't appreciate his art,"
00:39:56,00:39:59,people from his original village.
00:39:59,00:40:00,- Oh.
00:40:00,00:40:01,"- 'Cause as you say,"
00:40:01,00:40:03,I think he was born in something like Pittsburgh.
00:40:03,00:40:06,"But ethnically, he was Russin."
00:40:06,00:40:09,"Not Russian, Russin."
00:40:09,00:40:12,Which is this really tiny ethnicity
00:40:12,00:40:14,from the Carpatho-Russian Mountains.
00:40:14,00:40:17,"And it's between Poland, Slovakia and Ukraine."
00:40:17,00:40:18,And that's where both his parents were born
00:40:18,00:40:21,before they emigrated to America.
00:40:21,00:40:23,"It actually, so he's from a place called Ruthenia,"
00:40:23,00:40:27,"it's also called, which existed as a nation for one day"
00:40:27,00:40:28,in 1939. - What?
00:40:28,00:40:31,"- Yeah, it declared independence"
00:40:31,00:40:34,and then immediately was invaded by Hungary.
00:40:34,00:40:35,"- Oh, that's bad luck."
00:40:35,00:40:37,(laughing)
00:40:37,00:40:38,- Or was there a connection?
00:40:38,00:40:40,"- There was a connection. - Oh, sorry."
00:40:40,00:40:41,"- It wasn't that they were thinking,"
00:40:41,00:40:42,when should we do it?
00:40:42,00:40:44,"Let's wait, no, we'll wait."
00:40:44,00:40:45,Should we do it today?
00:40:45,00:40:46,"No, no, let's wait."
00:40:46,00:40:46,"Okay, finally."
00:40:46,00:40:48,Let's declare our independence.
00:40:48,00:40:49,"Oh, fuck."
00:40:49,00:40:52,- Go on forward the chances.
00:40:52,00:40:54,- There was stuff happening in 1939.
00:40:54,00:40:55,I'm not sure if you're aware of that.
00:40:55,00:40:55,- I understand.
00:40:55,00:40:58,"- But anyway, he's got all these cousins"
00:40:58,00:40:59,still there in the area.
00:40:59,00:41:02,And they kept in touch with Andy Wall's parents
00:41:02,00:41:03,when they were in America.
00:41:03,00:41:06,And the parents wrote back to their cousins in Slovakia
00:41:06,00:41:08,saying he's a painter.
00:41:08,00:41:10,"And people were interviewed saying until the late 70s,"
00:41:10,00:41:12,they all thought he just painted houses.
00:41:12,00:41:15,"They were like, oh, there's a house painter."
00:41:15,00:41:17,And then there was some good interviews.
00:41:17,00:41:19,Like he's got a cousin.
00:41:19,00:41:21,"I think a first cousin called Julia Vasholova,"
00:41:21,00:41:23,"who's from there, still lives there."
00:41:23,00:41:26,"And she said, semi-recently,"
00:41:26,00:41:28,"in America, you don't really need to be good at something."
00:41:28,00:41:30,You just need to be different.
00:41:30,00:41:33,"Warhol was just really good at being different, wasn't he?"
00:41:33,00:41:34,- So he's called Warholah.
00:41:34,00:41:36,It was an A originally.
00:41:36,00:41:38,"But isn't it, I think it's in Slovakia"
00:41:38,00:41:40,that they have the second largest collection
00:41:40,00:41:42,of Andy Warhol art now and memorabilia.
00:41:42,00:41:46,So there's an actual museum there that's outside of Pittsburgh.
00:41:46,00:41:46,But how are you going to compete
00:41:46,00:41:48,"with 600 boxes of mummified feet, right?"
00:41:48,00:41:50,Like you're not going to come first.
00:41:50,00:41:53,"But yeah, so they've obviously embraced it now."
00:41:53,00:41:54,"- Well, a little bit."
00:41:54,00:41:55,"The person who set up the museum embraced it,"
00:41:55,00:41:57,but he did go around trying to tell everyone
00:41:57,00:41:59,"to get into it, him and a lot of his family"
00:41:59,00:42:00,"and people there were like, we don't get it."
00:42:00,00:42:01,We don't like it.
00:42:01,00:42:02,- Right.
00:42:02,00:42:03,- Whatever.
00:42:03,00:42:04,- And then he was shot.
00:42:04,00:42:05,- And then he was shot.
00:42:05,00:42:10,"- By Valerie Solanas, who he put in a few movies."
00:42:10,00:42:13,She thought she should have been in more of his movies.
00:42:13,00:42:15,- He shot me and then I shot him.
00:42:15,00:42:17,"- Yes, I guess so."
00:42:17,00:42:17,"- He took the task, isn't he?"
00:42:17,00:42:20,- I think she had a few issues.
00:42:20,00:42:23,But basically she was a member of a feminist organization
00:42:23,00:42:27,"called the Society for Cutting Up Men, or SCUM."
00:42:27,00:42:29,And she walked into his factory
00:42:29,00:42:32,'cause the place where he worked was called the factory.
00:42:32,00:42:34,"And she just walked in, shot him and walked out again."
00:42:34,00:42:36,"And then a few hours later,"
00:42:36,00:42:38,"she kind of went to a policeman saying,"
00:42:38,00:42:40,I think the police are looking for me.
00:42:40,00:42:43,"I am a flower child, arrest me immediately."
00:42:43,00:42:44,And they arrested her.
00:42:44,00:42:47,"- And he survived, just 'cause if you don't know his story,"
00:42:47,00:42:48,"that sounds like he died, but yeah."
00:42:48,00:42:49,- Oh yeah.
00:42:49,00:42:51,"- It was 168, this all happened."
00:42:51,00:42:53,I thought that the reason she shot him
00:42:53,00:42:57,was because he had lost the script of a play
00:42:57,00:43:01,"that she had written called Up Your Ass, which,"
00:43:01,00:43:02,and apparently--
00:43:02,00:43:04,- Or is that where he lost it?
00:43:04,00:43:05,(laughing)
00:43:05,00:43:07,"- But I mean, she went to jelly the way, yeah."
00:43:07,00:43:09,"- Yeah, probably for a few years."
00:43:09,00:43:10,"- Yeah, he was declared."
00:43:10,00:43:11,- She was declared.
00:43:11,00:43:12,"- And to be honest, I don't know."
00:43:12,00:43:15,But the episode of his shooting is insane.
00:43:15,00:43:16,It's the kind of shooting you'd imagine
00:43:16,00:43:18,in Andy Warhol's mad life.
00:43:18,00:43:20,"Two friends there, his friend Mario Amaya"
00:43:20,00:43:22,"was also shot on the bullet,"
00:43:22,00:43:25,"went all the way through from back to front,"
00:43:25,00:43:26,"didn't get any organs,"
00:43:26,00:43:28,but then they called an ambulance
00:43:28,00:43:30,and it took half an hour to arrive.
00:43:30,00:43:33,"And in that time, more mates turned up,"
00:43:33,00:43:34,found this blood-soaked scene.
00:43:34,00:43:36,"Mario was running around going,"
00:43:36,00:43:37,"""Is there a bullet in my back?"
00:43:37,00:43:38,"""Is there a bullet in my back?"""
00:43:38,00:43:41,And then Andy Warhol's lying dead
00:43:41,00:43:43,and he was literally declared dead.
00:43:43,00:43:44,- Really? - Yep.
00:43:44,00:43:46,- In one of those youth here that was a fact
00:43:46,00:43:47,"and you think, ""No, surely not."""
00:43:47,00:43:49,But he was taken to hospital.
00:43:49,00:43:50,He had no signs of life
00:43:50,00:43:52,and there was a sort of vascular surgeon in the room
00:43:52,00:43:55,"who said, ""Hang on, I quite like the soup cans thing."
00:43:55,00:43:56,"""I'm gonna really try and sew this guy up."""
00:43:56,00:43:58,"- Not true, the doctor didn't know who it was."
00:43:58,00:44:00,They thought he was a random tramp.
00:44:00,00:44:01,"- Oh, I thought they thought he was a tramp at first"
00:44:01,00:44:02,and then they were told he was Warhol
00:44:02,00:44:04,when they were operating.
00:44:04,00:44:05,Although I'm not saying
00:44:05,00:44:06,he wouldn't have operated on the random tramp.
00:44:06,00:44:09,"- No, Giuseppe Rossi was the name of the surgeon."
00:44:09,00:44:10,What a guy.
00:44:10,00:44:12,"This is an artist, okay?"
00:44:12,00:44:12,"Boy, he did."
00:44:12,00:44:15,Serious.
00:44:15,00:44:18,"Warhol's been shot, I think, twice and really badly."
00:44:18,00:44:19,"He's in very, very bad nick."
00:44:19,00:44:20,He's dead.
00:44:20,00:44:21,- He's dead.
00:44:21,00:44:25,"- But Rossi opens Andy Warhol's chest,"
00:44:25,00:44:28,"massaged his heart, took out his spleen"
00:44:28,00:44:31,and he puts it in order for 12 pints of blood.
00:44:31,00:44:33,"And he's like, ""We can do this."""
00:44:33,00:44:34,- And he did it.
00:44:34,00:44:35,- Yeah.
00:44:35,00:44:36,- And Andy Warhol thanked him
00:44:36,00:44:39,by giving him 10 posters of Campbell's soup.
00:44:39,00:44:41,"- Well, thanks."
00:44:41,00:44:43,"- Hang on, that's gonna be worth so much."
00:44:43,00:44:47,"- Yes, they were sold after Rossi eventually died."
00:44:47,00:44:48,I think his widow then sold it
00:44:48,00:44:50,'cause I imagine they kept them for life.
00:44:50,00:44:51,- Yeah.
00:44:51,00:44:51,"- You know, yeah, yeah."
00:44:51,00:44:54,"- If I gave a doctor 10 posters, that's an insult."
00:44:54,00:44:55,- What would you pick?
00:44:55,00:44:56,Posters of what?
00:44:56,00:44:57,Fish tour posters?
00:44:57,00:44:57,"- Yeah, fish tour posters."
00:44:57,00:44:59,- This is Fanella's dream.
00:44:59,00:45:01,We've got to give away 10 of my posters.
00:45:01,00:45:03,"- Brilliant, I've got them ready, Dad."
00:45:03,00:45:06,- Poor surgeons at home after a very hard day's work.
00:45:06,00:45:07,"So I was like, there's a life-sized model"
00:45:07,00:45:09,of Groucho Marx outside.
00:45:09,00:45:11,(laughing)
00:45:11,00:45:19,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show"
00:45:19,00:45:21,and that is James.
00:45:21,00:45:22,"- Okay, my fact this week"
00:45:22,00:45:25,"is that when Stansted Airport was being planned,"
00:45:25,00:45:29,"locals, complaining to maintain the area's natural beauty,"
00:45:29,00:45:32,often met in a village called Ugly.
00:45:32,00:45:33,- Lovely.
00:45:33,00:45:34,(laughing)
00:45:34,00:45:37,- So initially this was a fact that I found
00:45:37,00:45:39,about the Ugly Women's Institute.
00:45:39,00:45:41,"We were gonna do an Ugly Women's Institute fact,"
00:45:41,00:45:45,but that's kind of on the internet a fair bit.
00:45:45,00:45:46,"And when I was researching that,"
00:45:46,00:45:49,I found this campaign about Stansted
00:45:49,00:45:53,and they were deciding where to put London's third airport.
00:45:53,00:45:55,And it turns out that quite a few of the meetings
00:45:55,00:45:58,to stop the airport from going around there
00:45:58,00:46:00,took place in Ugly Church Hall.
00:46:00,00:46:01,(laughing)
00:46:01,00:46:03,Because Ugly is a village in Essex.
00:46:03,00:46:06,"- Yeah, and we should say Stansted is an airport."
00:46:06,00:46:08,It's an airport for international listeners
00:46:08,00:46:09,who have not been.
00:46:09,00:46:11,- It is not a great place to spend time.
00:46:11,00:46:12,- It's not a beautiful place.
00:46:12,00:46:13,- It's one of the big three.
00:46:13,00:46:15,"Gatwick Heathrow, Stansted."
00:46:15,00:46:16,"- But yeah, they had lots of meetings"
00:46:16,00:46:17,at this Ugly Church Hall.
00:46:17,00:46:20,Some of the Ugly residents were pro.
00:46:20,00:46:24,So the Ugly Youth Club (laughing)
00:46:24,00:46:27,wrote a letter to the Preservation Society
00:46:27,00:46:30,saying that it will bring some life into the area
00:46:30,00:46:33,that according to them had little around but farming.
00:46:33,00:46:35,And they said that a lot of young people
00:46:35,00:46:36,were moving out of the area.
00:46:36,00:46:38,And if you brought in this big airport
00:46:38,00:46:40,"with all the jobs it created,"
00:46:40,00:46:43,then maybe it will keep the Ugly Youth around.
00:46:43,00:46:46,"And Councillor Jay Luckey's responded saying,"
00:46:46,00:46:48,it's a feeling that the youth has
00:46:48,00:46:51,that they're being brought up among squares.
00:46:51,00:46:52,- Oh.
00:46:52,00:46:54,"- So yeah, so it was, you know,"
00:46:54,00:46:56,"it wasn't everyone was against it,"
00:46:56,00:46:59,but it is quite a beautiful part of the world actually.
00:46:59,00:46:59,- Is it?
00:46:59,00:47:00,- It is.
00:47:00,00:47:01,- Ugly is really nice.
00:47:01,00:47:03,I've been looking at photos.
00:47:03,00:47:06,"- It's lovely, as they will tell you."
00:47:06,00:47:08,"Understandably, they'll get defensive."
00:47:08,00:47:09,It's very beautiful.
00:47:09,00:47:10,Ugly Church is not ugly.
00:47:10,00:47:12,"- Yeah, ugly green, ugly village hall."
00:47:12,00:47:13,There's an ugly farmer's market
00:47:13,00:47:15,that happens every now and then.
00:47:15,00:47:16,- I went on to company's house.
00:47:16,00:47:18,There's an ugly coach house.
00:47:18,00:47:21,"And until 2023, there was a company called the Ugly Indian"
00:47:21,00:47:23,and it was based in Ugly.
00:47:23,00:47:24,And I can't find that what it was.
00:47:24,00:47:25,I assume it's a restaurant.
00:47:25,00:47:26,- Yeah.
00:47:26,00:47:27,- Right.
00:47:27,00:47:29,"- It's not gonna be a single person, right?"
00:47:29,00:47:30,- But there is.
00:47:30,00:47:34,- There's a group called the Ugly Indians in India
00:47:34,00:47:36,that kind of clean up potholes and stuff.
00:47:36,00:47:37,- Really?
00:47:37,00:47:38,- But it's not that.
00:47:38,00:47:39,"- Oh, that's cool."
00:47:39,00:47:40,"- No, that would be a terrible base"
00:47:40,00:47:42,for much to clean up bottles and in here.
00:47:42,00:47:44,- I really liked the very first mention
00:47:44,00:47:47,that we have of ugly written down is in 1041.
00:47:47,00:47:48,And it had a different name.
00:47:48,00:47:50,It wasn't called ugly then.
00:47:50,00:47:50,- Oh yeah?
00:47:50,00:47:52,- It was called ugly.
00:47:52,00:47:54,(all laughing)
00:47:54,00:47:56,"- Oh, you're spelling that?"
00:47:56,00:47:57,- U-G-E-L-E.
00:47:57,00:47:58,- Nice.
00:47:58,00:48:00,- Ugly.
00:48:00,00:48:02,"And actually the locals there,"
00:48:02,00:48:05,the locals there don't call it ugly.
00:48:05,00:48:07,"The posh ones who are living there,"
00:48:07,00:48:10,they like to call it ugly.
00:48:10,00:48:10,- Stop it.
00:48:10,00:48:11,"- No, they don't."
00:48:11,00:48:13,But there's not a single one.
00:48:13,00:48:15,- This was told to a reporter called Laura Fiddler
00:48:15,00:48:17,who was down there trying to find out
00:48:17,00:48:19,all the most interesting things about ugly.
00:48:19,00:48:22,- Laura Fiddler's misunderstood the jokes on her.
00:48:22,00:48:24,It's five kilometers north of Stansted Airport.
00:48:24,00:48:26,So Stansted is named after a town called
00:48:26,00:48:28,"Stansted Mount Fitchett,"
00:48:28,00:48:30,which is just outside where the airport is.
00:48:30,00:48:34,So it's not inconceivable they could've called it ugly airport.
00:48:34,00:48:35,- That would've been terrific.
00:48:35,00:48:38,"- Other nearby villages include Little London,"
00:48:38,00:48:41,"Mole Hill, Maggots End, and Hope End."
00:48:41,00:48:44,So Hope End Airport would've been a good one.
00:48:44,00:48:44,- That's good.
00:48:44,00:48:46,"There is a nearby village called Nasty,"
00:48:46,00:48:48,which is 12 miles away.
00:48:48,00:48:48,It's a long running.
00:48:48,00:48:50,I think it's just a joke.
00:48:50,00:48:52,"Reputedly there was a newspaper headline once,"
00:48:52,00:48:54,"""Nasty man marries ugly woman."""
00:48:54,00:48:57,"- I suspect it never happened, sadly."
00:48:57,00:48:58,- The evidence isn't bad.
00:48:58,00:49:01,"- Quite near to another little village called Matching Tye,"
00:49:01,00:49:02,which is a great name.
00:49:02,00:49:04,"- Oh, it's such a good name."
00:49:04,00:49:05,- It's T-Y-E.
00:49:05,00:49:08,Have you guys of Danor and the heard of Matching Tye?
00:49:08,00:49:09,- No.
00:49:09,00:49:10,- No.
00:49:10,00:49:11,- I'm really surprised you haven't
00:49:11,00:49:14,because Rick Mail lived there until he was three years old.
00:49:14,00:49:15,- Oh!
00:49:15,00:49:17,"- That is a real gap in our knowledge, Dan."
00:49:17,00:49:19,"- Yeah, we're gonna have to send in our badge"
00:49:19,00:49:20,and our gun back to Rick Mail.
00:49:20,00:49:22,So I think they shouldn't let us have a gun.
00:49:22,00:49:24,- I thought you had a badge and a big frying pan.
00:49:24,00:49:27,(all laughing)
00:49:27,00:49:30,"- More Essex place names, just as we're on those."
00:49:30,00:49:32,There's Shallow Bowls.
00:49:32,00:49:33,"Shallow, not Shallow, really."
00:49:33,00:49:36,"Shallow Bowls, Wiggly Bush Lane,"
00:49:36,00:49:38,"Burnt Dick Hill, Dancing Dick's Lane,"
00:49:38,00:49:41,"and the best of all, Fingering Ho."
00:49:41,00:49:42,- Hopefully.
00:49:42,00:49:43,- Come on.
00:49:43,00:49:44,- Fingering Ho.
00:49:44,00:49:45,- Ho.
00:49:45,00:49:46,- Fingering Ho.
00:49:46,00:49:48,"Yeah, you've said it three times now."
00:49:48,00:49:50,"We've heard it, I think we understand why it's funny."
00:49:50,00:49:53,(all laughing)
00:49:53,00:49:53,- That's great.
00:49:53,00:49:57,"- Speaking of Dicks, Dicks related names,"
00:49:57,00:49:59,"there is an Ugly Women's Institute,"
00:49:59,00:50:02,"and there was, well, it was certainly reported"
00:50:02,00:50:04,in the late '50s that they decided to change
00:50:04,00:50:06,"to Women's Institute brackets, ugly,"
00:50:06,00:50:07,"but then by the '80s,"
00:50:07,00:50:09,"they were back to being the Ugly Women's Institute,"
00:50:09,00:50:13,and their president in the late '70s was Mrs. Dicks.
00:50:13,00:50:16,Mrs. Dicks was president of the Ugly Women's Institute.
00:50:16,00:50:17,Yes.
00:50:17,00:50:20,"- You know the most famous person to visit ugly ever, I think."
00:50:20,00:50:22,"- Oh, just like passing visit."
00:50:22,00:50:22,- Yeah.
00:50:22,00:50:23,- Daphne and Celeste.
00:50:23,00:50:25,- No.
00:50:25,00:50:27,- Think more German.
00:50:27,00:50:28,- German.
00:50:28,00:50:29,- Daphne and Celeste.
00:50:29,00:50:32,(all laughing)
00:50:32,00:50:35,"- Tomorrow German, well, Ahets, Adolf Hitler."
00:50:35,00:50:36,- You know what?
00:50:36,00:50:39,"Right period, right cabinet, in fact."
00:50:39,00:50:40,- Gering.
00:50:40,00:50:40,- Okay.
00:50:40,00:50:41,- Hitler.
00:50:41,00:50:42,- It's another.
00:50:42,00:50:44,- Can we just pause on the fact that James has a nickname
00:50:44,00:50:45,for Hitler?
00:50:45,00:50:47,(all laughing)
00:50:47,00:50:49,- We go way back.
00:50:49,00:50:49,- Ahets.
00:50:49,00:50:51,- We're just reading it off his tattoo there.
00:50:51,00:50:54,(all laughing)
00:50:54,00:50:56,- I couldn't fit the full name on my penis.
00:50:56,00:50:59,(all laughing)
00:50:59,00:51:03,- Oh my God.
00:51:03,00:51:05,- Wow.
00:51:05,00:51:07,"- Oh, dear."
00:51:07,00:51:09,- It was Joachim von Ribbentrop.
00:51:09,00:51:09,"- Oh, is it?"
00:51:09,00:51:10,- Yeah.
00:51:10,00:51:11,- Try fitting that on your penis.
00:51:11,00:51:13,(all laughing)
00:51:13,00:51:15,- Of Pactfame.
00:51:15,00:51:17,- Of Pactfame.
00:51:17,00:51:20,- The moment when Ribbentrop was Russian and German.
00:51:20,00:51:21,He was the foreign minister.
00:51:21,00:51:25,I think this was before his time as German foreign minister.
00:51:25,00:51:28,"He visited Orford House, which is just outside, I think,"
00:51:28,00:51:31,but it's still in the sort of parish boundaries.
00:51:31,00:51:33,"And of course, later he was the first man"
00:51:33,00:51:35,hanged for war crimes after the Nuremberg trials.
00:51:35,00:51:36,"- He was, yeah."
00:51:36,00:51:37,I think he might have been the only person
00:51:37,00:51:38,"who's been too ugly, who was hanged"
00:51:38,00:51:40,as part of the Nuremberg trials.
00:51:40,00:51:41,- And what was he?
00:51:41,00:51:42,- I believe.
00:51:42,00:51:43,- And what was that?
00:51:43,00:51:45,Like why was he staying at a hotel
00:51:45,00:51:46,the night before a flight from Stanstead?
00:51:46,00:51:48,(all laughing)
00:51:48,00:51:50,- It was a beautiful house that I think was owned
00:51:50,00:51:53,by a local toff who invited him over probably.
00:51:53,00:51:54,- And he loved England.
00:51:54,00:51:55,I think it was Ribbentrop who kept on trying
00:51:55,00:51:57,to get him to invade England
00:51:57,00:51:58,'cause he thought all of it was so beautiful.
00:51:58,00:51:59,Loved Cornwall.
00:51:59,00:52:00,- Yeah.
00:52:00,00:52:01,- Right.
00:52:01,00:52:02,"- Yeah, probably loved ugly."
00:52:02,00:52:06,- So there was a big argument about Stanstead Airport
00:52:06,00:52:07,when it came in.
00:52:07,00:52:09,So we had two airports in London.
00:52:09,00:52:11,"We had Gatwick and Heathrow,"
00:52:11,00:52:13,and they thought we're definitely gonna have
00:52:13,00:52:14,to build a third one.
00:52:14,00:52:17,And the decision that we were gonna need
00:52:17,00:52:19,"was starting about the '50s and '60s,"
00:52:19,00:52:21,and they didn't actually build Stanstead Airport
00:52:21,00:52:22,until the '80s.
00:52:22,00:52:25,"I think it finished in '85, something like that."
00:52:25,00:52:29,"Because actually, Stanstead in the end was,"
00:52:29,00:52:31,they just did up an old airfield.
00:52:31,00:52:33,Like rather than building like
00:52:33,00:52:35,"a whole big massive new airport,"
00:52:35,00:52:37,"like is what they were planning,"
00:52:37,00:52:40,they kind of rolled back on that idea a little bit
00:52:40,00:52:41,"and went for the smaller version,"
00:52:41,00:52:43,which was what Stanstead was.
00:52:43,00:52:45,But everyone obviously got really upset about it.
00:52:45,00:52:47,"- People don't like airports near them, do they?"
00:52:47,00:52:48,"I understand, please."
00:52:48,00:52:50,"- And it wasn't even, like during the war,"
00:52:50,00:52:51,"during the Second World War,"
00:52:51,00:52:54,it was the ninth largest American air base in East Anglia.
00:52:54,00:52:56,"Like it might not have been the obvious choice, actually."
00:52:56,00:52:57,They were bigger ones.
00:52:57,00:52:58,"After the war, it was used as a base"
00:52:58,00:53:00,for German prisoners of war
00:53:00,00:53:02,who were gonna be sent back to Germany.
00:53:02,00:53:03,And actually--
00:53:03,00:53:04,"- That's a good idea, isn't it?"
00:53:04,00:53:05,"- Well, if you get a Stanstead now,"
00:53:05,00:53:07,they've really preserved that sense
00:53:07,00:53:09,of what it must have been like.
00:53:09,00:53:10,Yeah.
00:53:12,00:53:13,- And they nearly built the third airport
00:53:13,00:53:17,in a place called Wing in Buckinghamshire.
00:53:17,00:53:21,"Yeah, there was locals there weren't happy about it,"
00:53:21,00:53:25,either informed the Wing Airport Resistance Association.
00:53:25,00:53:26,But that was gonna be a really big airport.
00:53:26,00:53:29,"And it was after the oil crisis in the '70s,"
00:53:29,00:53:31,they decided that actually we should do a smaller one
00:53:31,00:53:33,and that's when they went to Stanstead.
00:53:33,00:53:35,So we could have had a Wing airport.
00:53:35,00:53:37,"And actually where the airport was gonna be,"
00:53:37,00:53:39,"there's now, they put some trees there"
00:53:39,00:53:42,and you can go and visit that sort of patch of forest
00:53:42,00:53:44,of where there should have been an airport.
00:53:44,00:53:47,- Is that a big tourist hotspot in Buckinghamshire?
00:53:47,00:53:50,- Just nimbyism in general.
00:53:50,00:53:51,- Oh yeah.
00:53:51,00:53:52,"- You know, there's a nimby not in my backyard."
00:53:52,00:53:55,This is what people say when they don't want to think.
00:53:55,00:53:59,The alternatives are the banana people
00:53:59,00:54:02,and that is built absolutely nothing anywhere near anything.
00:54:02,00:54:03,(laughing)
00:54:03,00:54:04,It's good.
00:54:04,00:54:05,- That's brilliant.
00:54:05,00:54:05,"- And there's an idea in,"
00:54:05,00:54:07,"I think it's more of an American thing when it's cave,"
00:54:07,00:54:10,"which is citizens against virtually everything,"
00:54:10,00:54:11,which is another good idea.
00:54:11,00:54:12,"- Nice, that's really good."
00:54:12,00:54:14,"- But maybe the paradigm example of this,"
00:54:14,00:54:16,this was something that happened in Medway in Kent.
00:54:16,00:54:20,"So not far from Essex, three years ago."
00:54:20,00:54:22,"Medway Council, they really wanted to add solar panels"
00:54:22,00:54:24,to their headquarters.
00:54:24,00:54:26,"It's kind of a post-war, like modern initial block."
00:54:26,00:54:29,"It's not sort of, it's not incredibly exciting to look at."
00:54:29,00:54:31,They thought let's stick some solar panels on there.
00:54:31,00:54:33,So the Medway Council put in an application
00:54:33,00:54:35,to Medway Council to put solar panels
00:54:35,00:54:37,on their own headquarters and they were shocked
00:54:37,00:54:39,that Medway Council turned down the request
00:54:39,00:54:43,"by Medway Council saying, no, this is not appropriate at all."
00:54:43,00:54:46,The weird thing is it already had solar panels on it.
00:54:46,00:54:48,"They were just like, can we put some more on there?"
00:54:48,00:54:51,(upbeat music)
00:54:51,00:54:55,"- Okay, that is it."
