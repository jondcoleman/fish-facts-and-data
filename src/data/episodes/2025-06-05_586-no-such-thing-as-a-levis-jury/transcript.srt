1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:14,680
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,440
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,080
 coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,240
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,600
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,960
 Anna Tyshinski and James Harkin.

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,080
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,840
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,120
 and in no particular order, here we go.

11
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,920
 Starting with fact number one and that is Anna.

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,000
 - My fact this week is that when Socrates lost feeling

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,320
 in his penis, he asked his friend to sacrifice a cock.

14
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,160
 - Wow.

15
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,960
 - When you say sacrifice is cock, does that mean

16
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,200
 he swaps it over for Socrates as well?

17
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,480
 - Like a battery swap, yeah, yeah, yeah.

18
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,320
 - Have you rubbed it?

19
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,880
 - Yeah, have you put it in the right way around?

20
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,320
 - It's like a literal auger donor.

21
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,960
 - This is very immature wording of a very serious story

22
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,200
 about someone who had to commit suicide.

23
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,880
 So it's 399 BC.

24
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,760
 - Wow, I didn't actually read the story.

25
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,160
 - He was executed by himself.

26
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,240
 - Yeah, I think that is a difference.

27
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,080
 - It is so bizarre, the, yeah,

28
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,040
 I don't know if we do this anymore in any countries

29
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,280
 that the state sentenced him to suicide,

30
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,360
 which I don't know if you can call it suicide

31
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,600
 when the state, but they gave him the hemlock and he took it.

32
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,960
 Anyway, and the effect of it,

33
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,360
 because he was so hardcore, Socrates,

34
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,200
 and he was so, had his shit together,

35
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,720
 hemlock usually had quite violent effects on people,

36
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,720
 but according to the people around him,

37
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,720
 with him, it just made him go numb gradually

38
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,800
 from the feet up, it crept up his legs,

39
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,480
 and as it reached his groin,

40
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,720
 the numbness of the hemlock as he was killing himself,

41
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,680
 according to Plato, he spoke his last words,

42
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,920
 which were, we owe a rooster to a sclipius,

43
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,880
 we owe a cock to a sclipius,

44
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,080
 don't forget to pay that debt.

45
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,920
 And then he died.

46
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,080
 - And a sclipius was a god,

47
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,400
 this is not a person he had borrowed a cockerel from.

48
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,240
 - Yes, sorry.

49
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,600
 - And we should say we're in fourth century Athens.

50
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,800
 That's the other thing we should say.

51
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,640
 - BC.

52
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,080
 - In context, BC, sorry, fourth century BC Athens,

53
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,440
 a sclipius was the god of healing.

54
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,920
 - Yeah, and the idea is that whenever you were sick

55
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,760
 and you got better, you sacrificed a cockerel to a sclipius,

56
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,200
 but he saw his death as a recovery from life almost,

57
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,720
 like he wasn't scared of death was the point.

58
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,560
 - It's been cured of the sickness of living.

59
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,200
 - It's very cryptic.

60
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,080
 Like, and also you can't ask him,

61
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,280
 what did you mean by that exactly?

62
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,360
 Because he's just, he's literally just died.

63
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,480
 So there are a few theories of,

64
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,640
 or maybe he's making fun of the Pythagoreans

65
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,880
 because they saw cockerels as being sacred,

66
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,600
 or maybe he was alluding to something else.

67
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,760
 But it seems likely that exactly he was saying,

68
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,040
 actually, life is the illness.

69
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,200
 - Yes, nice.

70
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,320
 - Real chin stroker.

71
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,440
 - Well, he was a funny man, wasn't he?

72
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,880
 - He was a funny guy, yeah.

73
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,080
 - There's a big theory that he didn't die of hemlock really.

74
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,120
 I mean, he had died of hemlock,

75
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,280
 but it wasn't the hemlock that made him go numb

76
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,960
 because hemlock doesn't make you go numb.

77
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,320
 - No, but as I said, he's a very special man.

78
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,160
 - I think the-

79
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,000
 - But then there are other theories.

80
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,880
 - The suggestion is that he had a lot of opium

81
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,680
 mixed in with it to kind of take the edge off a little bit.

82
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,520
 - Okay.

83
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,480
 - Because there was a guy in the 18th century

84
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,520
 described the effects of hemlock.

85
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,720
 And there was a guy called Fergus Cadd,

86
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,920
 and he was living in the village of Talisca,

87
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,000
 and he mistakenly ate some hemlock roots

88
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,880
 thinking it was carrots.

89
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,960
 And he said, his eyes did roll about,

90
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,760
 his countenance became very pale,

91
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,600
 his sight had almost failed him,

92
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,880
 the frame of his body was all in a strange convulsion,

93
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,560
 and his pudenda retired so inwardly

94
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,680
 that there was no discerning

95
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,320
 whether he had been male or female.

96
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,520
 - Okay, out.

97
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,360
 - But it was quite funny,

98
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,200
 it would make you convulse and stuff.

99
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,320
 - Was he all right in the end?

100
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,360
 - This guy actually got better.

101
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,720
 They basically, they gave him loads of stuff

102
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,480
 to make him vomit and make him shit himself

103
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,960
 until it all got out of his system,

104
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,040
 and he just about survived.

105
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,640
 - What about his pudenda?

106
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,960
 (all laughing)

107
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,040
 Did they reinflate?

108
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,160
 - Not recounted.

109
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,000
 (all laughing)

110
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,360
 Don't get the wrong, the important stuff.

111
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,600
 - That's interesting about the opium

112
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,040
 because that kind of suggested

113
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,760
 it's like the equivalent of a last meal

114
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,800
 when you're on death row.

115
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,160
 It's like, you're gonna be drinking this,

116
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,160
 what would you like as your mixer?

117
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,000
 - Yeah.

118
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,840
 - What do you want in there to make it go down nicely

119
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,680
 at the end?

120
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,920
 - Can I have a hemlock and opium?

121
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,640
 Oh, we've already got Pepsi, is that okay?

122
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,480
 (all laughing)

123
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,160
 - Opium Max, unfortunately.

124
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,080
 - Well, we should say what he was sentenced to death for.

125
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:22,920
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

126
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,760
 - So.

127
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,680
 - Corrupting the youth.

128
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,640
 - Corrupting the youth and also impiety.

129
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,360
 And he'd been teaching young people critical thinking,

130
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,840
 which he was frowned on,

131
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,680
 and he'd also probably not been taking religion

132
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,640
 completely seriously,

133
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,920
 and Athens was a very religious society.

134
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,200
 And also, the other sort of context is like,

135
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,040
 Athens had had this really rough time.

136
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,480
 It was sort of, it was in the golden age of democracy,

137
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,960
 but they'd just been really walloped in a war

138
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,720
 by the Persians, and it was a very rough time.

139
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,880
 And there's a theory that people were willing

140
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,960
 to put up with Socrates,

141
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,760
 who famously asked provocative questions,

142
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,440
 didn't accept the established version of things,

143
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,880
 like he was a provocateur, he was a thinker.

144
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,640
 And there was a theory that when it was going fine

145
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,400
 for Athens, people were willing to put up with that.

146
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,720
 And then when Athens was really doing badly,

147
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,480
 people said, "This is subversive now.

148
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,360
 "So you're gonna have to knock it off."

149
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,200
 - Interesting.

150
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,720
 - He was tried for that, you know?

151
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,520
 He was tried by a jury, and it was a massive jury.

152
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,120
 It's not like you're a classic 12 angry people.

153
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,480
 It is 501 jury members.

154
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,800
 - The Levi's jury.

155
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,120
 - The Levi's jury.

156
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,440
 (all laughing)

157
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,280
 - Absolutely.

158
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,200
 And it was, the one extra is so that you don't get a tie

159
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,640
 when it comes to the fighting.

160
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,600
 - It'd be bad luck to get 250 all, wouldn't it?

161
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,920
 (all laughing)

162
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,760
 - Exactly.

163
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,280
 He ended up with a close margin, 280 voted,

164
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,400
 that he was guilty versus 221.

165
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,600
 - It's not that close.

166
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,880
 - Well, I guess it's--

167
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,360
 - It's thump it in a modern democracy,

168
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,520
 that's a resounding mandate.

169
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,920
 - Okay, well he got thumped.

170
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,600
 Well, what's even crazier is that he lost it, 280 to 221.

171
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,920
 That was just to find him guilty.

172
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,520
 Then there was another vote to see

173
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,760
 what the sentence should be.

174
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,040
 He said, "Well, I think you should give me

175
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,360
 "free lunch for life."

176
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,920
 Like he was a joker, right?

177
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,520
 That pissed off the members of the jury,

178
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,960
 including jury members who said that he was innocent.

179
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,200
 And even they voted for the death sentence,

180
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,720
 because I was so pissed off by that joke that he made.

181
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,560
 - Yeah.

182
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,760
 - I think it's a weird thing to ask the newly guilty party,

183
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,480
 what do you think your punishment should be?

184
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,560
 It's a bit like asking a toddler, isn't it?

185
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,400
 - Yeah.

186
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,880
 - But maybe that was a little bit like twist,

187
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,200
 playing your own game, Mr. Socrates.

188
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,200
 You're the one always asking us bloody questions,

189
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,480
 rather than giving us answers.

190
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,000
 Well, we'll ask you a question.

191
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,760
 - Did anyone vote for the free lunches for life?

192
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,400
 (all laughing)

193
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,000
 - To be fair, he did get free lunches for life, probably.

194
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,840
 - Oh, yeah.

195
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,680
 - I mean, I don't imagine he had to pay

196
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,680
 for the hemlock and opium.

197
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,480
 - Maybe it was his clever way of saying,

198
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,440
 I think I should be put to death in a couple of days,

199
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,440
 but that I should get the food in the prison in that time.

200
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,920
 Like, there was his clever way of saying,

201
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,880
 yes, put me to death.

202
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,200
 - Yeah, it's gotta be a clever way of saying something,

203
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,320
 'cause that was what he did, wasn't it?

204
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,240
 - Well, actually, like, you know what?

205
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,800
 He was sentenced to death,

206
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,040
 but then his mates bribed the prison guards and said,

207
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,480
 we'll get you out of here.

208
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,440
 And he said, now you're all right.

209
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,280
 - Yeah.

210
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,560
 - I'll just take my punishment.

211
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,400
 - Really?

212
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,240
 - Yeah.

213
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,160
 - And his idea was that the law of Athens

214
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,160
 didn't protect him all the way through his life.

215
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,640
 And so it would be inconsistent to say,

216
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,960
 well, now I think that because the laws are against me,

217
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,440
 I shouldn't follow them anymore.

218
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,280
 - Bit ungrateful.

219
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,120
 - That is good.

220
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,080
 And he was 70 as well.

221
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,240
 So going on the Lamb would probably,

222
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,520
 I mean, just surviving in ancient Greece,

223
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,440
 outside Athens was probably hard.

224
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,800
 - Yeah, he must have been in terrible shape.

225
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,280
 Ancient Greece aged 70, 71.

226
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,640
 - Tom Cruise is 63.

227
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,080
 So let's put this in context.

228
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,120
 Socrates was only a few years older than Tom Cruise is now.

229
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,320
 So Socrates's method was really good.

230
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,280
 You know, you'd say,

231
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,120
 so what do you,

232
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,920
 you just get somewhere into a conversation.

233
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,800
 So what do you think about this matter or another?

234
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,760
 And they'd say their opinion.

235
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,160
 And then he would slowly unravel them.

236
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,000
 - Oh yeah.

237
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,840
 - And anytime they said something,

238
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,680
 he said, well, hang on,

239
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,480
 you said just a moment ago that this other thing was true.

240
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,320
 So how can those both be true?

241
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,160
 And you would end up with both of you

242
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,640
 in a state of aporia,

243
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,600
 where neither of you can further define the idea

244
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,960
 that is under discussion.

245
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,960
 And there are lots of anecdotes written about Socrates

246
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,920
 getting into conversation with people who end up just saying

247
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,400
 to him, sorry, I have to go.

248
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,680
 I don't, I don't, I have nothing, I have nothing more to say.

249
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,040
 - I want my way to work.

250
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,160
 - He's basically like a charity mugger outside the station.

251
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,640
 So just one minute.

252
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,680
 - What do you think of free speech?

253
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,200
 - Did he get punched too much?

254
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,480
 Was he, was he ever?

255
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,080
 - I can imagine you're in the groceries

256
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,440
 and you're behind Socrates

257
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,000
 and he's questioning the seller, you know.

258
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,600
 - Would you punch someone for that?

259
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,560
 Maybe try to engage Dan.

260
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,320
 - You should see him in the 10 items

261
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,560
 off your line.

262
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,920
 - What is an item?

263
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,480
 That's a bunch of grapes.

264
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,600
 Is that one item?

265
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,680
 Is that 12 items?

266
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,920
 - He did used to cost people in the gym quite a lot

267
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,880
 when they were exercising,

268
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,240
 which maybe isn't a good idea

269
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,000
 if you want to avoid being punched.

270
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,160
 - If he was in the gym causing ruckus and starting fights,

271
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,000
 I actually think he would have held up on his own

272
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,440
 because we do picture Socrates

273
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,240
 as this older philosopher walking around barefooted.

274
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,640
 - You know how I picture him?

275
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,440
 Exactly how he is in Bill and Ted's excellent adventure.

276
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,440
 - Yes.

277
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,120
 - And I also pronounce him Socrates

278
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,960
 because of the time.

279
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,480
 - Socrates, yeah, exactly.

280
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,680
 We picture him as this philosopher,

281
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,960
 but actually he was a decorated military hero.

282
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,280
 He went all the way up to 48.

283
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,720
 He was still going to battles.

284
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,240
 He was still in front line.

285
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,560
 And I just didn't know that about him at all.

286
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,880
 I've just had this old man philosopher in my head.

287
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,800
 - But it does raise some questions

288
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,720
 because so the three main people in his life

289
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,720
 he wrote about him were Aristophanes, Xenophon and Plato.

290
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,440
 So a huge amount from Xenophon.

291
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,360
 And I hadn't realized he saved Xenophon

292
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,640
 in the middle of battle.

293
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,080
 So in the Peloponnesian Wars Xenophon was dying.

294
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,920
 It's a little bit like the two little boys story.

295
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,520
 Xenophon's lying there dying.

296
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,320
 He trots up says, "Do you think I'd leave you dying?"

297
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,480
 Tosses Xenophon over his shoulder

298
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,520
 and carries him out of battle with one hand

299
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,760
 while fighting people with the other.

300
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,120
 - I thought they both had a wooden horse or something.

301
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,160
 - Yeah, that's the Trojan War you're thinking of.

302
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,880
 (laughing)

303
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,400
 - No way, did you just make that joke?

304
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,760
 That's incredible.

305
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,360
 What is the two little boys' story?

306
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,880
 - Yes, they start off with a wooden horse

307
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,120
 but you've obviously never made it to verse two

308
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,600
 where they go into real battle.

309
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,960
 - Yet they grow up, do they grow apart

310
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,800
 and then they come back together

311
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,960
 and one of them saves the other's life.

312
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,120
 - Yeah, it does ring a bell now.

313
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,200
 - It's a tear-jerker.

314
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,760
 Anyway, then Xenophon wrote loads of really

315
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,880
 obsequious shit about him for the next 50 years

316
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,480
 but of course he did, he saved his life.

317
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,680
 - And we also got a lot from Plato

318
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,800
 'cause these are all his students, right?

319
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,920
 And Plato writes all the really smart things

320
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,840
 that Socrates thought.

321
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,520
 But actually, it kind of starts off like that

322
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:38,320
 but then towards the end, it's just whatever Plato thinks.

323
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,720
 And he's like, oh, yeah.

324
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,800
 Yeah, Socrates thought that Tremera the best team

325
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,880
 in League Two this season.

326
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,880
 Yeah.

327
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,400
 So he's just like, you never know where Socrates ends

328
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,880
 and where Plato starts.

329
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,240
 - Is it right that there's no written stuff by Socrates?

330
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,080
 There's no record of any of that.

331
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,400
 - He hated writing.

332
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,760
 - He was against it.

333
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,200
 - He thought it would ruin people's memories.

334
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,040
 - So it has proved.

335
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,520
 - And the well done hit, called it.

336
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,560
 - In fact, that's the reason that a lot of historians

337
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,440
 apparently really love the Bill and Ted movie

338
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,240
 because in it, you can't understand what he's saying

339
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,440
 and that is very on point with the fact

340
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,520
 that we don't know anything that he actually said.

341
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,360
 - Right.

342
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,960
 - So it's a perfect representation of Socrates.

343
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,800
 - Okay.

344
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,600
 - I haven't seen it, but I am gonna counter the claim

345
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,240
 that it's a perfect representation of Socrates,

346
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,080
 nonetheless.

347
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,920
 - Yeah.

348
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,760
 - Is that fair?

349
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,600
 - No, not fair.

350
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,440
 - Okay, sorry.

351
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,560
 - Most triumphant movie.

352
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,400
 - Was there a Mrs. Socrates?

353
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,240
 - Yes, there was.

354
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,060
 - Yes.

355
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,600
 - She was called Zanthipe, saying it right.

356
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,880
 - Very useful for us at the moment

357
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,360
 'cause we're researching the X series of QI.

358
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,200
 - Right.

359
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,040
 - As is Xenophon, actually.

360
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:40,880
 - Yes.

361
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,200
 - So they had three boys and they lived in near poverty

362
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,440
 while Socrates went around the city

363
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,400
 asking people weird questions.

364
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,840
 Does this remind you of anyone?

365
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,920
 (laughing)

366
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,880
 - Dad Shriver.

367
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,720
 - Three boys.

368
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,560
 - Yeah.

369
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,400
 - Yeah, near poverty.

370
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,760
 (laughing)

371
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,040
 - You're always just going around

372
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,280
 asking people weird questions while Fenn is saying,

373
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,800
 we need to sort out this or that.

374
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,640
 - Yes.

375
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,920
 - If Dad's the great philosopher of our time,

376
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,760
 we are really.

377
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,800
 (laughing)

378
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,640
 - Just another Zanthipe thing.

379
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,400
 This is a mystery that I got too deeply into,

380
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,480
 so I'm gonna drag you down.

381
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,520
 Zanthipe was the original Shrew.

382
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,600
 She's known throughout medieval history.

383
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,760
 She's the Shrewish wife.

384
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,000
 She's mentioned in the Taming of the Shrew as the archetype.

385
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,400
 And then a Shrew was discovered in the late 19th century

386
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,560
 and it was named Zanthipe's Shrew

387
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,040
 by the person who discovered it.

388
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,280
 Obviously after Zanthipe.

389
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:32,880
 But get this, its other name is the yellow-footed Shrew.

390
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,520
 Now, as I'm sure you all know,

391
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,800
 Zanthos in Greek is yellow, golden yellow,

392
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,360
 and Podes, Pe, Pe, is like feet.

393
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,880
 So Zanthipe sort of means yellow-footed

394
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,560
 and it's got yellow feet,

395
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,720
 but it's named after Zanthipe the woman.

396
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,680
 What's going on?

397
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,280
 - That's amazing.

398
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,640
 I got lost halfway through.

399
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,880
 - Has anyone followed?

400
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,240
 - So they named it after Zanthipe,

401
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,680
 the woman yellow-footed.

402
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,880
 - No, 'cause she's a Shrewish woman.

403
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,040
 - But if you twist the words a bit,

404
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,440
 it sounds like it's got yellow feet in Greek.

405
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,040
 - Exactly. - That's crazy.

406
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,880
 That's really good.

407
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,720
 - Thank you, Andy.

408
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,720
 - Are you the first person to make that link?

409
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,800
 - I think I might be.

410
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,640
 - Wow.

411
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,520
 - Yeah, this is going to blow some stuff open.

412
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,160
 - Yeah, let's get in touch with our PR.

413
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,480
 Let's get that out there.

414
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,720
 (laughing)

415
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,960
 - We don't have a PR.

416
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,840
 - Danny Express though, if you're listening.

417
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,520
 - I have a favorite Socrates sort of thing that he did.

418
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,160
 It's the Socrates freeze.

419
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,600
 Did you read about this?

420
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,640
 It's written about, so Plato writes about it

421
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,480
 in the Symposium.

422
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,920
 Basically, he used to get stuck with ideas in his head

423
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,120
 that he really needed to think about.

424
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,480
 And when he did, he just stopped or moved himself

425
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,320
 to a convenient out of the way spot

426
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,120
 and just remained there completely still

427
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,880
 no matter what he was on his way to.

428
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,200
 So in this, he was on his way to a dinner party

429
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,200
 and he suddenly had an idea.

430
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,520
 He just stands on the porch and just stays silent.

431
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,120
 And that's how he lived his life.

432
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,000
 When I walk into a room and can't remember why I went in,

433
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,160
 I do the exact same thing.

434
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,000
 - You just stop.

435
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,640
 - Just stand there and look around and go,

436
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,240
 what was it I came in here for?

437
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,600
 - Right, maybe you are the great philosopher of our time.

438
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,920
 - I think we all know that's true.

439
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,680
 - I think that's probably true.

440
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,400
 - But you're saying Socrates is standing on that porch

441
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,040
 going, who the fuck's house is this?

442
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,960
 - Yeah, that's what I reckon.

443
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,640
 My favorite Socrates is the--

444
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,720
 - I know who it's gonna be.

445
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,360
 - My favorite Socrates, who is it, Anna?

446
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,200
 Do you think?

447
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,920
 - It's gonna be the other famous Socrates in history,

448
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,760
 the football player.

449
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,600
 - The footballer.

450
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,440
 - Oh, nice.

451
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,600
 - From Brazil in the '80s.

452
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,720
 He was known as the smartest player

453
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,360
 in the Brazilian football team.

454
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,320
 - Question, was he known as Socrates

455
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,720
 before people thought he was smart?

456
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,280
 Or was he called Socrates and then people thought he was--

457
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,880
 - He was known as Socrates from a very young age.

458
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,360
 People in Brazil, they'll often get a nickname.

459
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,360
 - But I think actually his dad was a self-taught,

460
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,680
 very poor but self-taught guy,

461
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,720
 and he named him Socrates after the philosopher,

462
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,400
 'cause I think his brothers were called Sophocles

463
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,080
 and some other very lesser Greek person.

464
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,120
 - Yeah, so his dad was a philosopher,

465
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,320
 like he studied philosophy, and he had lots of books.

466
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,120
 And basically he was quite sad actually,

467
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,840
 'cause there was a coup d'etat in Brazil,

468
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,560
 and when the army came in,

469
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,200
 they forced everyone to burn all their books.

470
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,280
 And Socrates as a child, the footballer,

471
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,120
 he watched his dad burning all the books in his library

472
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,400
 and imagine how painful that was for him,

473
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,000
 because that was what he loved, he loved his books.

474
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,640
 - And did that then turn it onto football?

475
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,760
 He said, "Well, if I can't read 'cause of this coup,

476
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,960
 "I'm gonna become a footballer."

477
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,640
 - No, he was just a great footballer really,

478
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,520
 'cause he also had a medical degree.

479
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,080
 - Which he got while he was playing football.

480
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,720
 - Yeah, he was super smart.

481
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,560
 - He was amazing.

482
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,760
 - And then when he got towards the end of his career,

483
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,280
 he got into politics as well,

484
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,000
 and he said, "If this military dictatorship doesn't leave

485
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,520
 "and if they don't allow free elections,

486
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,000
 "then I'm gonna leave and I'm gonna go and play in Italy."

487
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,840
 - And what happened?

488
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,680
 - He went to play in Italy.

489
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,000
 - All right, that's so good, so what a letdown.

490
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,880
 I thought you were gonna say, "And the government, back down."

491
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,800
 - So in fairness, they did back down,

492
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,040
 eventually he played one year in Furentina,

493
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,920
 and then the next year they did back down and he came back.

494
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,960
 - But they didn't just abandon the dictatorship

495
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,920
 because it's to get him back into the country?

496
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,040
 - No, they didn't, but he was quite instrumental.

497
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,560
 - He was influential, yeah, he was such a big campaigner

498
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,160
 for all that, he was such a great guy,

499
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,600
 and he made them all wear shirts saying,

500
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,400
 "Democracy" in their big,

501
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,640
 this is when he played for the Corinthians,

502
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,040
 which is also really cool because obviously the Corinthians,

503
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,400
 great allies of Athens, allies of Socrates,

504
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,880
 the Socrates fought with them

505
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,320
 and the Peloponnesian Wars.

506
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,040
 - Anna, have you taken Dan's coincidence pills?

507
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,760
 This is insane, this is insane, I love it.

508
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:33,680
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

509
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,640
 - My fact is that a lot of people in the UK

510
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,840
 have their heating controlled by BBC Radio 4.

511
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:42,840
 - That is amazing.

512
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,480
 - Seem unlikely, doesn't it?

513
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,720
 - This is mad.

514
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,680
 This, I should say, was sent in as an audience fact,

515
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,600
 it's sent in by Bill Welch, so thank you, Bill.

516
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,040
 Right, so you will have electricity in your homes, right?

517
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,320
 - Not me with my poverty situation going on.

518
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,840
 I'm out on the streets anyway, so it doesn't matter.

519
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,760
 - So, your electricity is controlled by a meter,

520
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,600
 and it might be a smart meter if you've had it upgraded,

521
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,640
 or it might be an old-fashioned one,

522
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,600
 which measures the current going into your home

523
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,520
 and you pay for the amount you use,

524
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,240
 but you also pay maybe a different amount

525
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,520
 at different times of day.

526
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,680
 You know, at night, there's more electricity

527
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,440
 that's going unused, and there's more wind turbines

528
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,080
 going around, so there's lots of cheap electricity available.

529
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,240
 Some old-fashioned electricity meters

530
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,440
 can switch between different tariffs,

531
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,120
 different rates they're charging you,

532
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,440
 and the way they do it, switching twice a day,

533
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,200
 is that they are set up to receive a signal

534
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,200
 embedded in the BBC Radio 4 long-wave radio, so it's nuts.

535
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,880
 Twice a day, Radio 4 sends out this message from Droitwich,

536
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,200
 which is in the middle of the country,

537
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,560
 and it's a transmitter that can reach the whole country,

538
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,960
 and it just goes, "Blip!"

539
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,080
 And hundreds of thousands of homes across the country

540
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,760
 switch onto the new tariff

541
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,560
 that they're paying for their electricity.

542
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,960
 And this system, it dates back, I think, about 40 years.

543
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,440
 It's only meant to last another month or so,

544
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,280
 and they're meant to be shutting it down in June 2025,

545
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,280
 but still, they've got hundreds of thousands of homes

546
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,120
 where they haven't switched over the meters yet, so...

547
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,240
 - We don't know what's going to happen.

548
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,080
 - No. - Yeah.

549
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,920
 - 'Cause at a time of recording,

550
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,040
 they're still going to cut it off.

551
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,560
 - I know. - But good luck.

552
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,200
 They are trying to switch people over,

553
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,840
 but they have to accelerate pretty fast, too, right?

554
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,840
 - Yeah, switching people over at several thousand a day,

555
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,480
 or they're trying to. - But it's hard, is it?

556
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,120
 - It's hard, yeah. - And there is a petition,

557
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,760
 just in case anyone's listening and thinks,

558
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,960
 "Hang on, I don't want this to happen on change.org."

559
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,040
 Do check it out, 'cause it's...

560
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,320
 Like, I think it's gonna happen.

561
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,960
 I think there's time.

562
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,120
 - Yeah, and if you're listening to Radio 4

563
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,880
 and you're listening out for this noise,

564
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,160
 you're not gonna hear it. - No.

565
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,360
 (laughing)

566
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,040
 - Because it's not a bloop, not really.

567
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:44,040
 It's the signal is sent by the phase information of the wave.

568
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,160
 So you've got this radio wave sort of pulsing

569
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,320
 through the country, and it's always the same frequency

570
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,600
 so that you can pick it up on your radio.

571
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,760
 But if sometimes they put little changes

572
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,720
 in where the peaks and the troughs are in this wave,

573
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,760
 and those tiny changes are the things that it picks up,

574
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,840
 and your radio would normally strip away

575
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,360
 any of those differences.

576
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,160
 Any radio that you own, you would never hear this.

577
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,560
 Now, in theory, you could build a radio,

578
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,560
 like a ham radio, that would pick it up,

579
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,520
 but even if you did that,

580
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,040
 it would just be the tiniest little hum

581
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,760
 you would have. - Right.

582
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,600
 That's interesting.

583
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,200
 So if you are at home, and your radio is off,

584
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,640
 you've turned off Radio 4,

585
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,200
 that's, it can't get through the radio, right?

586
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,800
 Like, that's it, no.

587
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,920
 - That's not how radio works.

588
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,720
 - Then you pay loads of extra money for heating.

589
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,680
 It's such a stupid system,

590
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,280
 so you don't have to use their radios on all night.

591
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,320
 - Your electricity meter is a radio.

592
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,280
 - It contains a tiny little rod with iron in it,

593
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,600
 and that's an antennae,

594
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:45,000
 and that can receive 198 kilohertz radio waves,

595
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,520
 and any signal that comes in on that radio wave

596
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,600
 will be picked up by that little rod,

597
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,880
 and so that is kind of acting like a radio.

598
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,080
 - But you can't get a test match special

599
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,920
 through your electricity meter.

600
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,480
 - Okay, so if I lean up close,

601
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,760
 I won't hear the arches theme tune.

602
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,280
 Okay, that's good to know.

603
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,720
 - A test match special isn't played on radio for anyways.

604
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,560
 - No, it's all right.

605
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,400
 - Isn't it?

606
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,240
 - They got rid of it a few years ago.

607
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,400
 - Okay, oh my God.

608
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,720
 - I think that's the saddest part of all this stuff actually,

609
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,120
 the test match special isn't on radio for anymore.

610
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,960
 - Right, not even long wave.

611
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,960
 'Cause the reason they put it,

612
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,120
 like we should say,

613
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,160
 most people listen to FM all probably now digital, right?

614
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,600
 But long wave was 'cause there were about 90,000 homes

615
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,640
 in the country which couldn't get FM radio,

616
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,940
 and you would have to carpet the country with transmitters

617
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:28,240
 to make that signal available absolutely everywhere.

618
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,080
 So for those homes,

619
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,760
 they just had the long wave signal,

620
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,920
 which it's different that it'd get anywhere.

621
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,600
 And also if you then have a program that lasts

622
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,640
 for five days like test match special,

623
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,120
 you just shove it on long wave.

624
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,400
 So you don't have to stop all other radio for for a week.

625
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,360
 - But this is why the heating has had to be stopped, right?

626
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,440
 It's not about the heating systems changing over.

627
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,640
 It's about radio for saying no one's using long wave anymore.

628
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,560
 So also this will be probably news

629
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,080
 to maybe five people after the country.

630
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,440
 They're stopping broadcasting over long wave.

631
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,640
 And this is just the knock on effect

632
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,480
 where these guys are going,

633
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,040
 "Hang on, that's gonna stop my heating."

634
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,320
 Although it doesn't really affect that many people.

635
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,880
 For instance, if you go to Curry's and try and buy a radio,

636
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,440
 I think of all the radios they sell in the entire country,

637
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,960
 there's only one of them

638
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,680
 that will pick up long wave signals these days.

639
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,520
 - Really, is that true?

640
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,640
 - We're shooting ourselves in the foot

641
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,640
 by turning off long wave.

642
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,620
 What about when the internet stops, when it breaks,

643
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:22,160
 we're gonna need a good reliable backup system

644
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,480
 and that can be long wave.

645
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,920
 - Yeah, well, that's probably there, right?

646
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,920
 For us to still use.

647
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,760
 - No, it's not.

648
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,880
 This is the weird thing.

649
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,720
 The whole point of it

650
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,440
 is that they can't get these handmade glass valves.

651
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,640
 There are these big glass valves

652
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,600
 which make the long wave signal work.

653
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,160
 And the BBC bought the entire global supply some years ago,

654
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,080
 which was 10.

655
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,400
 (laughing)

656
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,240
 You need two of them

657
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,640
 to make the transmitter work, right?

658
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,680
 - How long did they last?

659
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,280
 - Well, between one and 10 years.

660
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,120
 - Okay.

661
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:49,960
 (laughing)

662
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,880
 - You know, so then down to their last two now.

663
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,240
 They've got like, they've got no spares in the cupboard.

664
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,480
 They're using their last two valves.

665
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,520
 When one of those goes, the system goes.

666
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,360
 - Yeah.

667
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,160
 - One interesting thing about the long wave,

668
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,240
 especially this thing in Dritewitch is,

669
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,960
 you have to send out a frequency,

670
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,000
 and it has to be exactly 198 kilohertz, right?

671
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,160
 But how do you make sure

672
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,600
 that the frequency is always the same

673
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,720
 when you're sending this signal out?

674
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,560
 - Yeah.

675
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,400
 - I don't know.

676
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,480
 - Well, they used to have a thing called an SN ring,

677
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,760
 and it was made of quartz.

678
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,680
 And if you apply voltage to quartz,

679
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,320
 it vibrates at a very precise frequency.

680
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,640
 And you had to, it had to be in a perfect ring,

681
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,760
 and you had to sort of hang it up by nylon threads.

682
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,240
 (laughing)

683
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,160
 - It's so cool, the technology we used to have.

684
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,040
 - And one of these existed inside the Dritewitch thing,

685
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,440
 so that you would always have the exact frequency.

686
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,000
 And now they do it with rubidium.

687
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,720
 So they get some rubidium atoms, like a gas.

688
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,400
 And rubidium atoms, rubidium 87, the isotope,

689
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,080
 they always transition between two energy levels.

690
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,800
 This is quantum physics now,

691
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:00,800
 which are exactly 6.834682610 gigahertz apart.

692
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,800
 And that's basically an atomic clock.

693
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,960
 That's what that is.

694
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,880
 - Yeah, 'cause this is how we used to keep time in Paris,

695
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,600
 wasn't it, with the quartz before they came up

696
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,440
 with the better version?

697
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,280
 - Absolutely.

698
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,560
 That's how my cassio works.

699
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,400
 - Yes.

700
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,680
 (laughing)

701
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,600
 - Actually, I'm not even joking,

702
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,200
 it has a small piece of quartz in.

703
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,520
 That's how a digital watch.

704
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,040
 - So yours works in the same way

705
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,480
 that the SN ring would work.

706
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,600
 Obviously, you don't have rubidium atoms in there.

707
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,560
 - I didn't spring for that.

708
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,280
 I saw it on Amazon as an option,

709
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,680
 it's like, but it was three quid more.

710
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,800
 And I thought, no, stuff that.

711
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,360
 - But the atomic clock inside Droughtwitch,

712
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,280
 not lose more than one second every 3,000 years,

713
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,240
 if it was a watch, which is pretty good.

714
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,080
 Although we're now up to with atomic clocks,

715
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,400
 ones that won't lose a second in 30 billion years.

716
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,240
 - Yeah, we've got two perfectionists here, haven't we?

717
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,400
 It's like having to find the next digit of pi.

718
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,240
 - Yeah.

719
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,080
 - Who cares?

720
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:47,920
 We've gone far enough.

721
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,460
 - A second every 3,000 years is still,

722
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,440
 if you'd started that when we invented farming

723
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,400
 and came to now, it would still be within three seconds,

724
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,040
 which I think is good.

725
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,560
 I think that's good.

726
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,600
 - Socrates would be almost a second late

727
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,640
 if you had a meeting with him.

728
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,240
 - It doesn't matter, he's frozen half a mile

729
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,080
 down the road anyway.

730
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,320
 (laughing)

731
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:10,040
 - I had to refresh my memory from the old GCSE

732
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,920
 in physics of how on earth all these waves bloody work.

733
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:17,080
 And so, in case you need it, long wave hugs the ground,

734
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,160
 which I just like the idea that that's why it can get

735
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,960
 to all of those places is that,

736
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,880
 like some sort of weird cartoon character

737
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,600
 just clings just above the ground

738
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,360
 so it can gallop over mountains and humps and everything.

739
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,560
 - So if you're in a valley, you still get it?

740
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,880
 - Exactly.

741
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,120
 - Is it bouncing off the sky?

742
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,840
 - Sometimes it is, but more important

743
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,240
 with the bouncing of the sky.

744
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,360
 And I think this is the very cool thing,

745
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,400
 is short wave reception.

746
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,280
 So short wave relies on the ionosphere,

747
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:49,280
 which is the ring in our atmosphere of charged ions.

748
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,040
 And the reason they're charged is because the sunlight

749
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,000
 bashes into atoms in the daytime in our atmosphere

750
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,600
 and it causes them all to react with each other

751
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,160
 and lose electrons and they become ions.

752
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,280
 So it's all very electrically charged.

753
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,480
 And we use that ionosphere short wave

754
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,280
 to bounce radio signal up and then back down to us.

755
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,320
 What I quite like about that is that that means

756
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,080
 that you'd get much better reception at night on the radio

757
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,880
 just because of how the ionosphere works.

758
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,280
 So basically in the daytime,

759
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,560
 the ionosphere has been all charged up by the sun.

760
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,520
 So it's lots of ions, like free electrons,

761
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,600
 wandering around looking for a partner.

762
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,360
 And so the radio wave goes up,

763
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,040
 like someone going into a ballroom full of dancers

764
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,160
 looking for partners.

765
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,200
 - The sexy stuff, yeah, yeah.

766
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,040
 - Yeah.

767
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,800
 And it's harder in the daytime to get through that ballroom

768
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,760
 because the dancers keep on trying to dance with you.

769
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,040
 They're these free ions being like,

770
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,320
 "Hey, pair up with me, pair up with me."

771
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,480
 But in the nighttime, they all chill out,

772
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,200
 they recombine with their normal partners

773
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,600
 'cause the sunlight's gone away and stopped stirring them up.

774
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,960
 So the radio signal of your short wave radio

775
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,920
 can just go straight through the dance floor

776
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,240
 without anyone assaulting them for it.

777
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,880
 - Which is all well and good,

778
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,000
 but you can't play cricket at the nighttime.

779
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,120
 So the terrible irony is you can never listen

780
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,320
 to "Test Met Special" with a good signal.

781
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,840
 - And that is the ultimate point is it's pointless.

782
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,040
 What good radios on a three in the morning?

783
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,360
 - "Droit Witch" played a part in D-Day.

784
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,200
 - Did it?

785
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,040
 - Yes, it did.

786
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:15,880
 - The D in D-Day stands for "Droit Witch" day, yeah.

787
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,800
 The date of the landings was broadcast

788
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,480
 from the "Droit Witch" transmitter

789
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,000
 because there were people in France, the resistance,

790
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,360
 they were getting signals from Britain

791
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,680
 and how do you send a signal all the way to France?

792
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,640
 Well, it's pretty difficult

793
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,240
 unless you have a big old tower that can send long wave.

794
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,960
 And so they did and they could pick up

795
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,200
 the BBC French service from there

796
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,480
 and they played like a poem by Paul Vellan, I think.

797
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,360
 And when they heard that poem,

798
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,360
 they knew that this was the time to,

799
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,880
 basically what they did was they would kind of cause ruckus

800
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,680
 with the Germans and like, you know,

801
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,840
 just be a pain in the arse.

802
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,840
 - If you're gonna block the roadways,

803
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,680
 blow them up now.

804
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,880
 - Yeah, exactly, yeah, yeah.

805
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,200
 Just keep them occupied in various,

806
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,920
 oh, ironically, you're the one who's occupied,

807
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:01,440
 but keep them occupied while we're going onto the beaches.

808
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,400
 - So the signal was like, create a distraction.

809
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,240
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

810
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,080
 - Cool.

811
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:05,920
 - Can we say what the line was?

812
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,760
 It's so cool.

813
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,760
 So as you said, James, it was a poem by Paul Vellan

814
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,760
 who was a 19th century, quite avant-garde gay poet.

815
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,760
 Like, he was quite--

816
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,160
 - Was he the one who had an affair with Rambo, I think?

817
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,000
 - I think he did.

818
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 - Not Rambo, the--

819
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,360
 (laughing)

820
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,560
 - That's looking interesting.

821
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,960
 - I was told me more.

822
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,800
 Who's Rambo?

823
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,560
 - Arthur Rambo was the poet as well.

824
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,400
 Yeah.

825
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,240
 - Oh, God.

826
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,680
 - They were like the romantic poets of France.

827
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,640
 - Yeah, they were terrific.

828
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,160
 - That's a disappointing movie night

829
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,000
 when I've rented that movie.

830
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,200
 - Rambo, First Blood.

831
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,800
 (laughing)

832
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,040
 - Actually, Total Eclipse starring Leonardo DiCaprio

833
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,000
 as Rambo is a great film, Dan.

834
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,840
 - Wow.

835
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,200
 - Yeah, there you go.

836
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,600
 - And so the poem starts.

837
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,760
 (speaking in foreign language)

838
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,400
 "The long sobs of autumn violins

839
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,480
 "wound my heart with a monotonous langer."

840
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,720
 Very poetic.

841
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,400
 So when they broadcast the first half,

842
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,480
 that was a signal to the French resistance.

843
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,840
 Invasion's gonna be within two weeks.

844
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,000
 You've got two weeks to get ready.

845
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,840
 - Right.

846
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,240
 - And then they broadcast the second half of that line,

847
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,280
 which was, you've got 48 hours.

848
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,720
 Like, the French service broadcast all of these phrases,

849
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,400
 some of which were meaningful,

850
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,840
 like, "Molas's tomorrow will bring forth cognac."

851
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,320
 That just went into France,

852
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,280
 as it might've been done in Morse code,

853
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,680
 but it was- - Okay.

854
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,720
 - And then, "John has a long moustache."

855
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,880
 And some of these phrases were meaningful to the resistance,

856
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,000
 and a lot of them were nonsense,

857
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,680
 just to confuse the Germans, basically.

858
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,280
 - How interesting, right, cool, that's clever.

859
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,680
 - And the Germans knew the significance

860
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,720
 of the Verland poem.

861
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,360
 There was an officer, a German intelligence officer,

862
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,120
 who said, "Okay, the invasion's coming within 48 hours."

863
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,760
 And he passed the message on,

864
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,640
 but it did not get through to the army

865
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,960
 who were actually in charge of Normandy,

866
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,080
 and trying to man the beaches.

867
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,240
 - Did he go shortwave?

868
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,320
 - I didn't. - Grewed it up.

869
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,280
 - Yeah, the warning wasn't passed on.

870
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,400
 - That's mad, really.

871
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,640
 - It's huge, that's a big counterfactual.

872
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,120
 - Well, the amazing thing is also the Germans

873
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,680
 sent some signals from Droitwich as well.

874
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,080
 - Did they? - They had someone on the inside,

875
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,840
 and so they could use the Droitwich transmitter

876
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,560
 to send their own signals to people in France.

877
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,960
 - Right, there was a German spy in Droitwich.

878
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,800
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

879
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,640
 - They don't know who it was,

880
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,840
 they assume it was someone working at the BBC or something.

881
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,160
 - That's crazy. - Wow, that's cool.

882
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,240
 I like that Longwave can go through water as well,

883
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,680
 and that was submarines would use Longwave

884
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,680
 to get their radio, their Radio 4,

885
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,280
 they would literally use to get it.

886
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,480
 - I think they still do. - Yeah, they still do,

887
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,560
 but obviously at the end of this month, they weren't, right?

888
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,960
 - What are they gonna do?

889
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,360
 - I don't know, I don't obviously got a new thing,

890
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,120
 they're gonna swap too, but that was the thing,

891
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,280
 I'm sure we've said it, where in wartime,

892
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:31,400
 you would make sure that England was still there,

893
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,000
 basically, while you were under water,

894
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,720
 if Radio 4 was still going.

895
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,200
 - They've probably gone BBC sounds now.

896
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,080
 - That's true, they probably pre-download before they go.

897
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,000
 (all laughing)

898
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,240
 I do love codes in,

899
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,840
 I feel like we should do this at some point,

900
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,960
 there's a whole period of an American radio

901
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,080
 where they would put a code for the listener

902
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,720
 at the end of a radio show,

903
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,800
 so it would be like a little bit of Morse code,

904
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,400
 and you had a decoder at home as part of the fan club,

905
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,160
 so we would give little teasers for what's happening

906
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,600
 in the episode that you were gonna hear

907
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,880
 the next day or the next week.

908
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,960
 - That's a really good idea,

909
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,800
 'cause we know that you listening to this

910
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,440
 almost certainly stop listening

911
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,360
 before we say our email address is at the end,

912
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,880
 'cause we've seen the figures,

913
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,960
 we know when the drop-off comes.

914
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,600
 - Are you saying we should put them in Morse code

915
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,640
 at the start of the podcast?

916
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,840
 - No, I'm saying we put something special at the very end,

917
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,680
 so people are forced to listen to us saying,

918
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,880
 I'm on Instagram.

919
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,800
 - All right, we're gonna do it,

920
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,160
 we can just tell people we'll put something special in.

921
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,120
 - What should we put?

922
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:27,960
 Crossword?

923
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,720
 - That's the most, that's the most fun,

924
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,540
 I think I've ever heard of.

925
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,760
 - What about Sudoku?

926
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,600
 - A Sudoku.

927
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,160
 - So I'll do the first box, blank.

928
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,960
 (all laughing)

929
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,600
 You're gonna listen next week.

930
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,960
 - In just 81 episodes time,

931
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,640
 you've made your own Sudoku credit.

932
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,960
 - That's great.

933
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,880
 - This'll get people listening.

934
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,460
 (upbeat music)

935
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:56,560
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

936
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,840
 and that is my fact.

937
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,520
 My fact this week is that Andy Warhol

938
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,600
 would regularly have his wig cut by a barber

939
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,280
 and then return the following month

940
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,200
 wearing a new longer wig.

941
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,840
 - Sorry, annoying for that barber.

942
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,680
 - Yeah, how did the barber react?

943
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,920
 - Well, this is Andy Warhol we're talking about.

944
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,520
 He, as well as being an artist,

945
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,080
 was an art piece in himself,

946
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,240
 and the barber would have known

947
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,320
 and would have enjoyed what they were doing.

948
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,480
 - And actually, at the moment, if you're a barber,

949
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,840
 you have to sit there waiting

950
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,440
 for your customers to grow hair,

951
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,960
 but if they just come in and buy some hair for you to cut,

952
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,120
 it's giving you more work.

953
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,520
 - Yeah, that's a good point.

954
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,800
 - Yeah, was it so that his friends

955
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:39,120
 would kind of slowly see his wig get longer and shorter

956
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,480
 so it looked more realistic?

957
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,520
 - Yeah, I think as well,

958
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,440
 like this is one of the most photographed

959
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,240
 socialites in America at the time.

960
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,640
 He wanted to make sure that his look was ever changing.

961
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,560
 It was sort of in fashion.

962
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,760
 The wig was a huge part of his life, by the way.

963
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,320
 - 'Cause his wig is a very obvious wig,

964
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,440
 Andy Warhol's, isn't it?

965
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,760
 - Yeah, it's silvery, isn't it?

966
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,400
 I know you had hundreds of wigs.

967
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,520
 - But iconic, so he basically started going bold

968
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,800
 when he was in his 20s, and he really didn't want this.

969
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,360
 And there's a lot of early art pieces

970
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,320
 where it clearly is playing on his mind.

971
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,440
 There's a piece that he did called "Bold?"

972
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,280
 Question mark, where he just showed

973
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,920
 someone gradually becoming bold in sketches.

974
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,800
 And so he took it very seriously.

975
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,720
 And there's a huge collection of Andy Warhol wigs

976
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,720
 that are out there now.

977
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,840
 They were all very nicely made by a man

978
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,480
 who was called Paul Bokiccio.

979
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,760
 They were iconic wigs.

980
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,560
 - Yeah, you could buy one in 2006 at auction

981
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,200
 for $10,800 at which time it was

982
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,120
 the most expensive wig ever sold.

983
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,680
 - Oh yeah, has it been overtaken?

984
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,200
 - Three times, do you wanna guess?

985
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,680
 - Oh, yes.

986
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,680
 - Who's Big Wigs?

987
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,520
 - You can get them all.

988
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,360
 - Big Wigs.

989
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,200
 - Marge Simpson?

990
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,040
 - Oh my God.

991
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:51,440
 Let's try some real life people.

992
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,600
 - Okay, okay.

993
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,000
 - But Big Wigs is a good name for when I turn this

994
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,360
 into a channel five format.

995
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,520
 - Yeah, absolutely.

996
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,960
 - I'll take my usual 10% fee.

997
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,440
 - Yeah, I feel like we might struggle

998
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,440
 after the first episode.

999
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,000
 In fact, after the first question.

1000
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,800
 (all laughing)

1001
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,360
 - I'm struggling now, I think I'm really famous.

1002
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,960
 So I'm thinking of people,

1003
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,000
 I'm thinking of iconic weird artists like

1004
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,840
 Salvador Dali.

1005
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,560
 - I think I'm more famous, very famous.

1006
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,040
 - Edna Everage?

1007
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,400
 - Edna Everage.

1008
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,480
 - Really good call.

1009
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,720
 Michael Jackson.

1010
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,840
 - Michael Jackson in at one, $75,000.

1011
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,680
 - Where's his wig?

1012
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,520
 - Where's his wig?

1013
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,280
 - He did wear wigs later on.

1014
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,920
 So he was in a commercial for Pepsi.

1015
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,760
 - Yeah.

1016
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,760
 - And there was a fire or he burnt his hair basically

1017
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,360
 and he had to wear wigs for a while after that.

1018
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,800
 - It was pyrotechnics that went wrong

1019
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,560
 during the advert recording and his head lit up.

1020
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,400
 He didn't even notice.

1021
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,080
 You can see the footage where he's still dancing

1022
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,440
 and his head is just in, yeah.

1023
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,480
 Oh, so that's number one.

1024
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,960
 - Are the famous wig wearers, so?

1025
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,240
 - Go for more famous people who might have happened

1026
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,000
 to have worn wigs at a certain time.

1027
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 - Dolly Parton.

1028
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,080
 - Close, but no.

1029
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,400
 - Give us one, like one clue that's sort of like.

1030
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,120
 - The most famous woman of the 20th century.

1031
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,240
 - Marilyn Monroe.

1032
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,720
 - Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor.

1033
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,680
 - Oh, double.

1034
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,520
 - Yeah.

1035
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,600
 You kind of spoiled the format by getting them so quickly.

1036
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,680
 Fill another 24 minutes of the show.

1037
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:11,680
 But it was Elizabeth Taylor's wig in "Clear Patra"

1038
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:15,960
 went for $16,000 and Marilyn Monroe's wig,

1039
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,240
 she wore in "The Misfits," which was her last film.

1040
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,480
 I went for $30,000.

1041
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,920
 - Nice.

1042
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,920
 - ♪ Da, da, da, da, da ♪

1043
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:27,120
 - Come back next week when we'll desperately be hoping

1044
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,080
 for some big news in the wig world.

1045
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,320
 (laughing)

1046
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,800
 - So he kept hundreds, didn't he, Andy Warhol?

1047
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,320
 In boxes and--

1048
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,680
 - Yeah, he was a huge hoarder.

1049
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,200
 - He collected everything in his life.

1050
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,360
 There's a weird, massive art.

1051
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,320
 I think there's an Andy Warhol museum somewhere.

1052
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,200
 Maybe it's in Pittsburgh, which is where he was from.

1053
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,040
 - Yeah.

1054
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,160
 - But it's got, wherever it is,

1055
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,080
 it's got 50,000 of his things or 100,000, you know,

1056
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:52,080
 sort of many floors of ticket stubs and old.

1057
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,520
 - He basically, at the end of every day,

1058
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,400
 he would get a big cardboard box

1059
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,640
 and anything that he had left over,

1060
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,680
 like half a sandwich or a smoke cigarette or something,

1061
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,840
 he would just pour it all into that box

1062
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,000
 and with market time capsule

1063
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,360
 and then just put it to one side.

1064
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,200
 - It's a good idea.

1065
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,840
 - And the Andy Warhol museum has hundreds of these

1066
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,040
 and I don't think they've all been opened.

1067
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,480
 - No, so back in 2007, there was a journalist

1068
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,200
 who was invited to see some of the boxes being opened.

1069
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,280
 So they had 600 boxes of these things.

1070
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,640
 I think only like 80 of them had been opened at that point

1071
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,480
 and they had just no idea what you'd find in it.

1072
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,600
 So he was there as they opened it

1073
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,360
 and they found an unopened Lionel Richie CD

1074
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:31,280
 and you know, but then they found things

1075
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,600
 like a mummified foot that he bought at a sort of sale,

1076
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,320
 you know, like a garage sale and that he kept in.

1077
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,080
 - This is a format James, I'm sorry,

1078
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:42,160
 but like when the wig show comes to the end

1079
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,200
 of its natural life after many seasons,

1080
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:48,000
 I think Andy Warhol's big box open is a good,

1081
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,400
 it's like storage walls where you bid against each other

1082
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,920
 for what's in a box and you might get a half-eaten sandwich

1083
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,240
 or you might get millions of flies, you know?

1084
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,000
 That's a fun concept.

1085
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,680
 Are any of them like moving or ticking or?

1086
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,920
 (laughing)

1087
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,640
 - It's very much something you can get away with

1088
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,120
 if you're a very famous artist.

1089
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,960
 But if I did that as an ordinary human being,

1090
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,640
 my friends would think I'd gone completely mad.

1091
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,320
 - It's unsustainable for all eight billion of us

1092
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,920
 to do this with all of our things.

1093
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:19,120
 - But also the wig became its own thing in his life

1094
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,680
 where it could act as him.

1095
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,520
 So there was a whole tour in colleges

1096
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,360
 and instead of going, he sent an actor.

1097
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,680
 I think the guy had his own hair,

1098
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,960
 but he cut it and he colored it to exactly Andy Warhol.

1099
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,160
 So iconic that look and he wore dark glasses.

1100
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,560
 - Can we say what he was called?

1101
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,400
 - Yeah, absolutely.

1102
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,640
 - He was called Alan Midget.

1103
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,680
 - Yeah, Midget.

1104
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,600
 - I'm so sorry for mispronouncing

1105
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,920
 something for comic effect.

1106
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,000
 (laughing)

1107
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,240
 - Alan Midget.

1108
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,480
 - He had an E at the end, but he put that E on.

1109
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,120
 It didn't have the originally.

1110
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,520
 - Yeah, thank you very much.

1111
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,480
 - And basically people were very annoyed with Andy Warhol

1112
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,480
 when they found out that he'd sent Alan Midget in his place

1113
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,880
 just like sunglasses in a wig.

1114
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,720
 - Yeah.

1115
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,440
 - Did they know straight away when he came up

1116
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,680
 or would they see the whole tour?

1117
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,800
 - Basically they screened an incredibly boring film

1118
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,880
 that Andy Warhol had shot.

1119
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,360
 And then Andy Warhol's shtick

1120
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,840
 was that he didn't answer any questions.

1121
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,200
 So you'd have a question and answer session

1122
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,000
 where you'd say like two word answers.

1123
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,120
 I think people did get pretty quickly.

1124
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,440
 - They eventually did get it.

1125
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,040
 And it was a bit confusing.

1126
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,920
 And the people around Andy would say,

1127
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,760
 isn't it fascinating?

1128
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,520
 Some people who'd even met Andy

1129
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,200
 would then meet Paul Midget and say,

1130
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,000
 wow, Andy, lovely to see you again.

1131
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,960
 And he was like, if enough people around a person

1132
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,280
 believe it is the person,

1133
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,000
 then they get confused into thinking it is.

1134
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 And that was the case.

1135
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,280
 Andy said they got a better deal

1136
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,440
 because actually Midget gave more answers at the talks

1137
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,520
 than Andy would have.

1138
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,480
 He was more personable.

1139
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,520
 He was more likable.

1140
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,560
 - Supposedly he was caught

1141
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,720
 when he ran out of silver hairspray.

1142
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,680
 Alan Midget, I don't know if that's true.

1143
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,600
 And people were so annoyed about this when it was discovered

1144
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,920
 that one Oregon college made Andy Warhol swear

1145
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,480
 on a Bible that he was Andy Warhol

1146
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,880
 before they let him do the event.

1147
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,160
 'Cause it was to students, these talks, basically.

1148
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,200
 And I think people had...

1149
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,120
 - But it feels better to see the double

1150
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,440
 because you're seeing an Andy Warhol work of art.

1151
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:02,040
 As Dan says, Andy Warhol made himself a work of art, didn't he?

1152
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,880
 So it was like everything he did, you had to appreciate.

1153
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,680
 And some people didn't get it.

1154
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,720
 - This guy is the Socrates of the 20th century.

1155
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,560
 I'm sorry, he's going around irritating people.

1156
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,840
 - Not answering any questions, only asking them.

1157
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,280
 - Yeah, he was a weird guy.

1158
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,400
 He did a lot of art, which was about replication

1159
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,400
 and uniformity.

1160
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,200
 And so one of his most famous things

1161
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,600
 is the paintings of Campbell's soup can.

1162
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,920
 - Yeah, that's what made him famous, really, yeah.

1163
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:30,720
 - But this was 1962, and it was his first big solo show.

1164
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,480
 So it was his debut to the art world.

1165
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,760
 It was not a success.

1166
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,280
 He sold five.

1167
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,360
 - Really? - Yeah.

1168
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,120
 In fact, I don't even know if he sold five.

1169
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,360
 Like a few of the, two were sold and a few more,

1170
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,760
 someone said, "Yeah, keep that back for me."

1171
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,960
 You know, it was a failure, I would say.

1172
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,440
 And the gallery owner then said,

1173
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,600
 "Actually, I'm not going to sell any of these.

1174
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,680
 "I want to keep the series together."

1175
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,520
 But I think it's interesting

1176
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,080
 that Campbell's didn't know about it,

1177
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:55,000
 because obviously he wouldn't have worn them or anything.

1178
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,040
 But then people started wearing Campbell's soup clothing

1179
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,640
 because this work of art had become popular.

1180
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,440
 And then Campbell's soup gave him a commission

1181
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,960
 to paint a can because their chairman was retiring.

1182
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,240
 So they've got this weird relationship.

1183
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,120
 Then they threatened to sue him later on.

1184
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:12,920
 Then they made their own dress out of soup can labels.

1185
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,680
 If you sent them $1 and two labels,

1186
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,520
 they would send you a dress

1187
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,920
 that looks like Campbell's soup can labels.

1188
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,280
 - Oh, so it was for anyway, it wasn't like high fashion.

1189
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,120
 - No, no, no.

1190
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,360
 It was just a sort of an offer.

1191
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,440
 But it was based on-- - Oh, $1.

1192
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,520
 That's a great value of dress.

1193
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,600
 - And two labels.

1194
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,680
 (laughing)

1195
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:27,920
 It's still a great value of dress.

1196
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,920
 But he just sort of dragged this perfectly innocent soup company

1197
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,080
 into the world of high art.

1198
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,000
 And then they started engaging with it off the back of it.

1199
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,840
 It was very much. - You may ask,

1200
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,680
 you might not know this,

1201
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,240
 but if that was such a failure,

1202
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:40,080
 at what stage did he become not a failure?

1203
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,000
 Do you know what I mean?

1204
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,760
 - I think it was very soon after that.

1205
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,640
 - I think it was almost the day after that.

1206
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,640
 - I think it's connected, yeah.

1207
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,600
 - A lot of people thought all the soup thing don't know.

1208
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,920
 And then a few critics said, actually, this is great.

1209
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,760
 - Actually, it's pretty good, yeah.

1210
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,000
 - Yeah, which I'm still on the fence about.

1211
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,440
 (laughing)

1212
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,520
 Some other people who don't appreciate his art,

1213
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,160
 people from his original village.

1214
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,000
 - Oh.

1215
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,920
 - 'Cause as you say,

1216
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,280
 I think he was born in something like Pittsburgh.

1217
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,680
 But ethnically, he was Russin.

1218
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,120
 Not Russian, Russin.

1219
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:12,400
 Which is this really tiny ethnicity

1220
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,720
 from the Carpatho-Russian Mountains.

1221
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,160
 And it's between Poland, Slovakia and Ukraine.

1222
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,640
 And that's where both his parents were born

1223
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:21,280
 before they emigrated to America.

1224
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,520
 It actually, so he's from a place called Ruthenia,

1225
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,000
 it's also called, which existed as a nation for one day

1226
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,960
 in 1939. - What?

1227
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,720
 - Yeah, it declared independence

1228
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,040
 and then immediately was invaded by Hungary.

1229
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,160
 - Oh, that's bad luck.

1230
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,000
 (laughing)

1231
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,520
 - Or was there a connection?

1232
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,800
 - There was a connection. - Oh, sorry.

1233
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,960
 - It wasn't that they were thinking,

1234
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,800
 when should we do it?

1235
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,400
 Let's wait, no, we'll wait.

1236
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,240
 Should we do it today?

1237
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,080
 No, no, let's wait.

1238
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,920
 Okay, finally.

1239
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,320
 Let's declare our independence.

1240
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,160
 Oh, fuck.

1241
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:52,360
 - Go on forward the chances.

1242
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,200
 - There was stuff happening in 1939.

1243
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,040
 I'm not sure if you're aware of that.

1244
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,880
 - I understand.

1245
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,360
 - But anyway, he's got all these cousins

1246
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,840
 still there in the area.

1247
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,760
 And they kept in touch with Andy Wall's parents

1248
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,880
 when they were in America.

1249
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,600
 And the parents wrote back to their cousins in Slovakia

1250
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,040
 saying he's a painter.

1251
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,440
 And people were interviewed saying until the late 70s,

1252
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,000
 they all thought he just painted houses.

1253
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,180
 They were like, oh, there's a house painter.

1254
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,920
 And then there was some good interviews.

1255
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,240
 Like he's got a cousin.

1256
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,560
 I think a first cousin called Julia Vasholova,

1257
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,560
 who's from there, still lives there.

1258
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,200
 And she said, semi-recently,

1259
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,200
 in America, you don't really need to be good at something.

1260
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,040
 You just need to be different.

1261
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:33,000
 Warhol was just really good at being different, wasn't he?

1262
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,360
 - So he's called Warholah.

1263
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,280
 It was an A originally.

1264
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,680
 But isn't it, I think it's in Slovakia

1265
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,560
 that they have the second largest collection

1266
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,960
 of Andy Warhol art now and memorabilia.

1267
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,060
 So there's an actual museum there that's outside of Pittsburgh.

1268
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:46,900
 But how are you going to compete

1269
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,920
 with 600 boxes of mummified feet, right?

1270
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,740
 Like you're not going to come first.

1271
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:53,320
 But yeah, so they've obviously embraced it now.

1272
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,160
 - Well, a little bit.

1273
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,640
 The person who set up the museum embraced it,

1274
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,360
 but he did go around trying to tell everyone

1275
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,440
 to get into it, him and a lot of his family

1276
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,960
 and people there were like, we don't get it.

1277
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,920
 We don't like it.

1278
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,760
 - Right.

1279
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,600
 - Whatever.

1280
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,920
 - And then he was shot.

1281
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,760
 - And then he was shot.

1282
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:10,160
 - By Valerie Solanas, who he put in a few movies.

1283
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,560
 She thought she should have been in more of his movies.

1284
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,960
 - He shot me and then I shot him.

1285
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,120
 - Yes, I guess so.

1286
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:17,960
 - He took the task, isn't he?

1287
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,600
 - I think she had a few issues.

1288
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,880
 But basically she was a member of a feminist organization

1289
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:27,160
 called the Society for Cutting Up Men, or SCUM.

1290
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,880
 And she walked into his factory

1291
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,120
 'cause the place where he worked was called the factory.

1292
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,800
 And she just walked in, shot him and walked out again.

1293
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,240
 And then a few hours later,

1294
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,560
 she kind of went to a policeman saying,

1295
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,880
 I think the police are looking for me.

1296
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,960
 I am a flower child, arrest me immediately.

1297
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:44,800
 And they arrested her.

1298
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,280
 - And he survived, just 'cause if you don't know his story,

1299
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,680
 that sounds like he died, but yeah.

1300
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,520
 - Oh yeah.

1301
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,920
 - It was 168, this all happened.

1302
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,960
 I thought that the reason she shot him

1303
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:57,040
 was because he had lost the script of a play

1304
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:01,920
 that she had written called Up Your Ass, which,

1305
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:02,760
 and apparently--

1306
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,200
 - Or is that where he lost it?

1307
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,800
 (laughing)

1308
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,520
 - But I mean, she went to jelly the way, yeah.

1309
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,200
 - Yeah, probably for a few years.

1310
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,640
 - Yeah, he was declared.

1311
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:11,480
 - She was declared.

1312
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,800
 - And to be honest, I don't know.

1313
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,440
 But the episode of his shooting is insane.

1314
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,520
 It's the kind of shooting you'd imagine

1315
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,520
 in Andy Warhol's mad life.

1316
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,760
 Two friends there, his friend Mario Amaya

1317
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,200
 was also shot on the bullet,

1318
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:25,040
 went all the way through from back to front,

1319
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,240
 didn't get any organs,

1320
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,400
 but then they called an ambulance

1321
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,600
 and it took half an hour to arrive.

1322
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,200
 And in that time, more mates turned up,

1323
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,880
 found this blood-soaked scene.

1324
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,400
 Mario was running around going,

1325
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,400
 "Is there a bullet in my back?

1326
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,680
 "Is there a bullet in my back?"

1327
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:41,240
 And then Andy Warhol's lying dead

1328
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,400
 and he was literally declared dead.

1329
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,240
 - Really? - Yep.

1330
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,240
 - In one of those youth here that was a fact

1331
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,640
 and you think, "No, surely not."

1332
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,520
 But he was taken to hospital.

1333
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,920
 He had no signs of life

1334
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,640
 and there was a sort of vascular surgeon in the room

1335
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,280
 who said, "Hang on, I quite like the soup cans thing.

1336
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,880
 "I'm gonna really try and sew this guy up."

1337
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,960
 - Not true, the doctor didn't know who it was.

1338
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,280
 They thought he was a random tramp.

1339
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,720
 - Oh, I thought they thought he was a tramp at first

1340
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:02,800
 and then they were told he was Warhol

1341
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,200
 when they were operating.

1342
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,040
 Although I'm not saying

1343
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,920
 he wouldn't have operated on the random tramp.

1344
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:09,000
 - No, Giuseppe Rossi was the name of the surgeon.

1345
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,640
 What a guy.

1346
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,080
 This is an artist, okay?

1347
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:12,920
 Boy, he did.

1348
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,560
 Serious.

1349
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:18,560
 Warhol's been shot, I think, twice and really badly.

1350
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,960
 He's in very, very bad nick.

1351
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:20,800
 He's dead.

1352
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:21,640
 - He's dead.

1353
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:25,000
 - But Rossi opens Andy Warhol's chest,

1354
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,520
 massaged his heart, took out his spleen

1355
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:31,560
 and he puts it in order for 12 pints of blood.

1356
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,400
 And he's like, "We can do this."

1357
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,720
 - And he did it.

1358
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,560
 - Yeah.

1359
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:36,800
 - And Andy Warhol thanked him

1360
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,440
 by giving him 10 posters of Campbell's soup.

1361
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,480
 - Well, thanks.

1362
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,440
 - Hang on, that's gonna be worth so much.

1363
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:47,280
 - Yes, they were sold after Rossi eventually died.

1364
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,360
 I think his widow then sold it

1365
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,240
 'cause I imagine they kept them for life.

1366
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,080
 - Yeah.

1367
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:51,920
 - You know, yeah, yeah.

1368
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,520
 - If I gave a doctor 10 posters, that's an insult.

1369
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,360
 - What would you pick?

1370
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,180
 Posters of what?

1371
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:57,020
 Fish tour posters?

1372
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:57,860
 - Yeah, fish tour posters.

1373
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:59,000
 - This is Fanella's dream.

1374
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,400
 We've got to give away 10 of my posters.

1375
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,720
 - Brilliant, I've got them ready, Dad.

1376
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,000
 - Poor surgeons at home after a very hard day's work.

1377
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,840
 So I was like, there's a life-sized model

1378
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,480
 of Groucho Marx outside.

1379
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,720
 (laughing)

1380
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:19,760
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show

1381
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,080
 and that is James.

1382
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:22,280
 - Okay, my fact this week

1383
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,480
 is that when Stansted Airport was being planned,

1384
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:29,440
 locals, complaining to maintain the area's natural beauty,

1385
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,440
 often met in a village called Ugly.

1386
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:33,280
 - Lovely.

1387
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,560
 (laughing)

1388
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,120
 - So initially this was a fact that I found

1389
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:39,680
 about the Ugly Women's Institute.

1390
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,960
 We were gonna do an Ugly Women's Institute fact,

1391
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:45,240
 but that's kind of on the internet a fair bit.

1392
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,640
 And when I was researching that,

1393
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:49,640
 I found this campaign about Stansted

1394
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:53,000
 and they were deciding where to put London's third airport.

1395
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,560
 And it turns out that quite a few of the meetings

1396
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:58,040
 to stop the airport from going around there

1397
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:00,680
 took place in Ugly Church Hall.

1398
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:01,680
 (laughing)

1399
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,680
 Because Ugly is a village in Essex.

1400
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,800
 - Yeah, and we should say Stansted is an airport.

1401
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,320
 It's an airport for international listeners

1402
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,680
 who have not been.

1403
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,440
 - It is not a great place to spend time.

1404
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,440
 - It's not a beautiful place.

1405
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:13,480
 - It's one of the big three.

1406
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,000
 Gatwick Heathrow, Stansted.

1407
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,160
 - But yeah, they had lots of meetings

1408
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,840
 at this Ugly Church Hall.

1409
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:20,360
 Some of the Ugly residents were pro.

1410
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:24,760
 So the Ugly Youth Club (laughing)

1411
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:27,880
 wrote a letter to the Preservation Society

1412
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:30,720
 saying that it will bring some life into the area

1413
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,840
 that according to them had little around but farming.

1414
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,600
 And they said that a lot of young people

1415
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:36,960
 were moving out of the area.

1416
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,880
 And if you brought in this big airport

1417
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,160
 with all the jobs it created,

1418
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,360
 then maybe it will keep the Ugly Youth around.

1419
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:46,200
 And Councillor Jay Luckey's responded saying,

1420
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,120
 it's a feeling that the youth has

1421
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:51,200
 that they're being brought up among squares.

1422
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,680
 - Oh.

1423
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,280
 - So yeah, so it was, you know,

1424
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,280
 it wasn't everyone was against it,

1425
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:59,000
 but it is quite a beautiful part of the world actually.

1426
00:46:59,000 --> 00:46:59,840
 - Is it?

1427
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:00,680
 - It is.

1428
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:01,520
 - Ugly is really nice.

1429
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,400
 I've been looking at photos.

1430
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,760
 - It's lovely, as they will tell you.

1431
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,640
 Understandably, they'll get defensive.

1432
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:09,480
 It's very beautiful.

1433
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,800
 Ugly Church is not ugly.

1434
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,440
 - Yeah, ugly green, ugly village hall.

1435
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:13,720
 There's an ugly farmer's market

1436
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:15,560
 that happens every now and then.

1437
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:16,840
 - I went on to company's house.

1438
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,360
 There's an ugly coach house.

1439
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:21,880
 And until 2023, there was a company called the Ugly Indian

1440
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,680
 and it was based in Ugly.

1441
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:24,920
 And I can't find that what it was.

1442
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:25,960
 I assume it's a restaurant.

1443
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:26,800
 - Yeah.

1444
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:27,640
 - Right.

1445
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,960
 - It's not gonna be a single person, right?

1446
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:30,800
 - But there is.

1447
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,080
 - There's a group called the Ugly Indians in India

1448
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:36,480
 that kind of clean up potholes and stuff.

1449
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,320
 - Really?

1450
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:38,160
 - But it's not that.

1451
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,000
 - Oh, that's cool.

1452
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,360
 - No, that would be a terrible base

1453
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:42,080
 for much to clean up bottles and in here.

1454
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:44,260
 - I really liked the very first mention

1455
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:47,240
 that we have of ugly written down is in 1041.

1456
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:48,720
 And it had a different name.

1457
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,040
 It wasn't called ugly then.

1458
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:50,880
 - Oh yeah?

1459
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,640
 - It was called ugly.

1460
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,680
 (all laughing)

1461
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:56,000
 - Oh, you're spelling that?

1462
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,840
 - U-G-E-L-E.

1463
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:58,680
 - Nice.

1464
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,520
 - Ugly.

1465
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:02,880
 And actually the locals there,

1466
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,760
 the locals there don't call it ugly.

1467
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,680
 The posh ones who are living there,

1468
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,000
 they like to call it ugly.

1469
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:10,840
 - Stop it.

1470
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:11,680
 - No, they don't.

1471
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,560
 But there's not a single one.

1472
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:15,800
 - This was told to a reporter called Laura Fiddler

1473
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,500
 who was down there trying to find out

1474
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:19,600
 all the most interesting things about ugly.

1475
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,520
 - Laura Fiddler's misunderstood the jokes on her.

1476
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:24,840
 It's five kilometers north of Stansted Airport.

1477
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,680
 So Stansted is named after a town called

1478
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,040
 Stansted Mount Fitchett,

1479
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:30,680
 which is just outside where the airport is.

1480
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:34,520
 So it's not inconceivable they could've called it ugly airport.

1481
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:35,960
 - That would've been terrific.

1482
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:38,360
 - Other nearby villages include Little London,

1483
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:41,840
 Mole Hill, Maggots End, and Hope End.

1484
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:44,000
 So Hope End Airport would've been a good one.

1485
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:44,960
 - That's good.

1486
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,640
 There is a nearby village called Nasty,

1487
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,040
 which is 12 miles away.

1488
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:48,880
 It's a long running.

1489
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,320
 I think it's just a joke.

1490
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,200
 Reputedly there was a newspaper headline once,

1491
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,160
 "Nasty man marries ugly woman."

1492
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:57,280
 - I suspect it never happened, sadly.

1493
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,520
 - The evidence isn't bad.

1494
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:01,740
 - Quite near to another little village called Matching Tye,

1495
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:02,580
 which is a great name.

1496
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:04,760
 - Oh, it's such a good name.

1497
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:05,880
 - It's T-Y-E.

1498
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,840
 Have you guys of Danor and the heard of Matching Tye?

1499
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:09,680
 - No.

1500
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:10,520
 - No.

1501
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:11,560
 - I'm really surprised you haven't

1502
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:14,600
 because Rick Mail lived there until he was three years old.

1503
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:15,440
 - Oh!

1504
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,200
 - That is a real gap in our knowledge, Dan.

1505
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,440
 - Yeah, we're gonna have to send in our badge

1506
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,760
 and our gun back to Rick Mail.

1507
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,560
 So I think they shouldn't let us have a gun.

1508
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,680
 - I thought you had a badge and a big frying pan.

1509
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:27,280
 (all laughing)

1510
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:30,080
 - More Essex place names, just as we're on those.

1511
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:32,280
 There's Shallow Bowls.

1512
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:33,960
 Shallow, not Shallow, really.

1513
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:36,240
 Shallow Bowls, Wiggly Bush Lane,

1514
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,580
 Burnt Dick Hill, Dancing Dick's Lane,

1515
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:41,320
 and the best of all, Fingering Ho.

1516
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:42,160
 - Hopefully.

1517
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,000
 - Come on.

1518
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,520
 - Fingering Ho.

1519
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,340
 - Ho.

1520
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:46,840
 - Fingering Ho.

1521
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,440
 Yeah, you've said it three times now.

1522
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,880
 We've heard it, I think we understand why it's funny.

1523
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,000
 (all laughing)

1524
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:53,840
 - That's great.

1525
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:57,120
 - Speaking of Dicks, Dicks related names,

1526
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,520
 there is an Ugly Women's Institute,

1527
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:02,680
 and there was, well, it was certainly reported

1528
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,800
 in the late '50s that they decided to change

1529
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,800
 to Women's Institute brackets, ugly,

1530
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:07,800
 but then by the '80s,

1531
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,940
 they were back to being the Ugly Women's Institute,

1532
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:13,680
 and their president in the late '70s was Mrs. Dicks.

1533
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,680
 Mrs. Dicks was president of the Ugly Women's Institute.

1534
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,520
 Yes.

1535
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,480
 - You know the most famous person to visit ugly ever, I think.

1536
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,040
 - Oh, just like passing visit.

1537
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:22,880
 - Yeah.

1538
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:23,720
 - Daphne and Celeste.

1539
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,040
 - No.

1540
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,680
 - Think more German.

1541
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:28,520
 - German.

1542
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:29,880
 - Daphne and Celeste.

1543
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:32,440
 (all laughing)

1544
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:35,800
 - Tomorrow German, well, Ahets, Adolf Hitler.

1545
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:36,640
 - You know what?

1546
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:39,160
 Right period, right cabinet, in fact.

1547
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,000
 - Gering.

1548
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:40,840
 - Okay.

1549
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:41,680
 - Hitler.

1550
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:42,520
 - It's another.

1551
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:44,360
 - Can we just pause on the fact that James has a nickname

1552
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,200
 for Hitler?

1553
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,040
 (all laughing)

1554
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,040
 - We go way back.

1555
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:49,880
 - Ahets.

1556
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,560
 - We're just reading it off his tattoo there.

1557
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:54,060
 (all laughing)

1558
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:56,800
 - I couldn't fit the full name on my penis.

1559
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,380
 (all laughing)

1560
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:03,200
 - Oh my God.

1561
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,760
 - Wow.

1562
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,080
 - Oh, dear.

1563
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:09,000
 - It was Joachim von Ribbentrop.

1564
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:09,840
 - Oh, is it?

1565
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:10,660
 - Yeah.

1566
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:11,840
 - Try fitting that on your penis.

1567
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,640
 (all laughing)

1568
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,680
 - Of Pactfame.

1569
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,000
 - Of Pactfame.

1570
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,240
 - The moment when Ribbentrop was Russian and German.

1571
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:21,600
 He was the foreign minister.

1572
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:25,160
 I think this was before his time as German foreign minister.

1573
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:28,920
 He visited Orford House, which is just outside, I think,

1574
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:31,520
 but it's still in the sort of parish boundaries.

1575
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,320
 And of course, later he was the first man

1576
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:35,440
 hanged for war crimes after the Nuremberg trials.

1577
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:36,280
 - He was, yeah.

1578
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:37,600
 I think he might have been the only person

1579
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,800
 who's been too ugly, who was hanged

1580
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,720
 as part of the Nuremberg trials.

1581
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:41,800
 - And what was he?

1582
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:42,640
 - I believe.

1583
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,520
 - And what was that?

1584
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,320
 Like why was he staying at a hotel

1585
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:46,920
 the night before a flight from Stanstead?

1586
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,560
 (all laughing)

1587
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,560
 - It was a beautiful house that I think was owned

1588
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:53,120
 by a local toff who invited him over probably.

1589
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:54,400
 - And he loved England.

1590
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,920
 I think it was Ribbentrop who kept on trying

1591
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,040
 to get him to invade England

1592
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,560
 'cause he thought all of it was so beautiful.

1593
00:51:58,560 --> 00:51:59,880
 Loved Cornwall.

1594
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:00,720
 - Yeah.

1595
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:01,560
 - Right.

1596
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:02,800
 - Yeah, probably loved ugly.

1597
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,440
 - So there was a big argument about Stanstead Airport

1598
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:07,280
 when it came in.

1599
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,520
 So we had two airports in London.

1600
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,520
 We had Gatwick and Heathrow,

1601
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,320
 and they thought we're definitely gonna have

1602
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,840
 to build a third one.

1603
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,360
 And the decision that we were gonna need

1604
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,920
 was starting about the '50s and '60s,

1605
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,680
 and they didn't actually build Stanstead Airport

1606
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:22,760
 until the '80s.

1607
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:25,720
 I think it finished in '85, something like that.

1608
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:29,600
 Because actually, Stanstead in the end was,

1609
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,920
 they just did up an old airfield.

1610
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,720
 Like rather than building like

1611
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,960
 a whole big massive new airport,

1612
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:37,680
 like is what they were planning,

1613
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,360
 they kind of rolled back on that idea a little bit

1614
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,720
 and went for the smaller version,

1615
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:43,280
 which was what Stanstead was.

1616
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,680
 But everyone obviously got really upset about it.

1617
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,360
 - People don't like airports near them, do they?

1618
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:48,200
 I understand, please.

1619
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,640
 - And it wasn't even, like during the war,

1620
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:51,480
 during the Second World War,

1621
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:54,240
 it was the ninth largest American air base in East Anglia.

1622
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,400
 Like it might not have been the obvious choice, actually.

1623
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,240
 They were bigger ones.

1624
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,680
 After the war, it was used as a base

1625
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,040
 for German prisoners of war

1626
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:02,480
 who were gonna be sent back to Germany.

1627
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,320
 And actually--

1628
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,160
 - That's a good idea, isn't it?

1629
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:05,080
 - Well, if you get a Stanstead now,

1630
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:07,000
 they've really preserved that sense

1631
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,440
 of what it must have been like.

1632
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:10,280
 Yeah.

1633
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:13,800
 - And they nearly built the third airport

1634
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:17,280
 in a place called Wing in Buckinghamshire.

1635
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:21,520
 Yeah, there was locals there weren't happy about it,

1636
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:25,160
 either informed the Wing Airport Resistance Association.

1637
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,960
 But that was gonna be a really big airport.

1638
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,600
 And it was after the oil crisis in the '70s,

1639
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,520
 they decided that actually we should do a smaller one

1640
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,200
 and that's when they went to Stanstead.

1641
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,560
 So we could have had a Wing airport.

1642
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,560
 And actually where the airport was gonna be,

1643
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,600
 there's now, they put some trees there

1644
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,680
 and you can go and visit that sort of patch of forest

1645
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,320
 of where there should have been an airport.

1646
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:47,000
 - Is that a big tourist hotspot in Buckinghamshire?

1647
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,360
 - Just nimbyism in general.

1648
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,200
 - Oh yeah.

1649
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,560
 - You know, there's a nimby not in my backyard.

1650
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:55,080
 This is what people say when they don't want to think.

1651
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:59,320
 The alternatives are the banana people

1652
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:02,560
 and that is built absolutely nothing anywhere near anything.

1653
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:03,400
 (laughing)

1654
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:04,220
 It's good.

1655
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:05,060
 - That's brilliant.

1656
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:05,900
 - And there's an idea in,

1657
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:07,560
 I think it's more of an American thing when it's cave,

1658
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:10,160
 which is citizens against virtually everything,

1659
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,560
 which is another good idea.

1660
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:12,920
 - Nice, that's really good.

1661
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,480
 - But maybe the paradigm example of this,

1662
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,960
 this was something that happened in Medway in Kent.

1663
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:20,240
 So not far from Essex, three years ago.

1664
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,360
 Medway Council, they really wanted to add solar panels

1665
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:24,120
 to their headquarters.

1666
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:26,720
 It's kind of a post-war, like modern initial block.

1667
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:29,080
 It's not sort of, it's not incredibly exciting to look at.

1668
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:31,000
 They thought let's stick some solar panels on there.

1669
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,080
 So the Medway Council put in an application

1670
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:35,520
 to Medway Council to put solar panels

1671
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,520
 on their own headquarters and they were shocked

1672
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,960
 that Medway Council turned down the request

1673
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:43,760
 by Medway Council saying, no, this is not appropriate at all.

1674
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,560
 The weird thing is it already had solar panels on it.

1675
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:48,680
 They were just like, can we put some more on there?

1676
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:51,260
 (upbeat music)

1677
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:55,000
 - Okay, that is it.

1678
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
 That is all of our facts.

1679
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,400
