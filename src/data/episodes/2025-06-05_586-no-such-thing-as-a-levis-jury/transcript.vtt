00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:14.680
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.440
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.080
 coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.240
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.600
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.960
 Anna Tyshinski and James Harkin.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.080
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.840
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.120
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.920
 Starting with fact number one and that is Anna.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.000
 - My fact this week is that when Socrates lost feeling

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.320
 in his penis, he asked his friend to sacrifice a cock.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.160
 - Wow.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.960
 - When you say sacrifice is cock, does that mean

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.200
 he swaps it over for Socrates as well?

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.480
 - Like a battery swap, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.320
 - Have you rubbed it?

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.880
 - Yeah, have you put it in the right way around?

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.320
 - It's like a literal auger donor.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.960
 - This is very immature wording of a very serious story

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.200
 about someone who had to commit suicide.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.880
 So it's 399 BC.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.760
 - Wow, I didn't actually read the story.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.160
 - He was executed by himself.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.240
 - Yeah, I think that is a difference.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.080
 - It is so bizarre, the, yeah,

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.040
 I don't know if we do this anymore in any countries

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.280
 that the state sentenced him to suicide,

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.360
 which I don't know if you can call it suicide

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.600
 when the state, but they gave him the hemlock and he took it.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.960
 Anyway, and the effect of it,

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.360
 because he was so hardcore, Socrates,

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.200
 and he was so, had his shit together,

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.720
 hemlock usually had quite violent effects on people,

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.720
 but according to the people around him,

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.720
 with him, it just made him go numb gradually

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.800
 from the feet up, it crept up his legs,

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.480
 and as it reached his groin,

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.720
 the numbness of the hemlock as he was killing himself,

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.680
 according to Plato, he spoke his last words,

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.920
 which were, we owe a rooster to a sclipius,

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.880
 we owe a cock to a sclipius,

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.080
 don't forget to pay that debt.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.920
 And then he died.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.080
 - And a sclipius was a god,

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.400
 this is not a person he had borrowed a cockerel from.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.240
 - Yes, sorry.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.600
 - And we should say we're in fourth century Athens.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.800
 That's the other thing we should say.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.640
 - BC.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.080
 - In context, BC, sorry, fourth century BC Athens,

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.440
 a sclipius was the god of healing.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.920
 - Yeah, and the idea is that whenever you were sick

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.760
 and you got better, you sacrificed a cockerel to a sclipius,

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.200
 but he saw his death as a recovery from life almost,

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.720
 like he wasn't scared of death was the point.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.560
 - It's been cured of the sickness of living.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.200
 - It's very cryptic.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.080
 Like, and also you can't ask him,

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.280
 what did you mean by that exactly?

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.360
 Because he's just, he's literally just died.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.480
 So there are a few theories of,

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.640
 or maybe he's making fun of the Pythagoreans

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.880
 because they saw cockerels as being sacred,

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.600
 or maybe he was alluding to something else.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.760
 But it seems likely that exactly he was saying,

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.040
 actually, life is the illness.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.200
 - Yes, nice.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.320
 - Real chin stroker.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.440
 - Well, he was a funny man, wasn't he?

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.880
 - He was a funny guy, yeah.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.080
 - There's a big theory that he didn't die of hemlock really.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.120
 I mean, he had died of hemlock,

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.280
 but it wasn't the hemlock that made him go numb

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.960
 because hemlock doesn't make you go numb.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.320
 - No, but as I said, he's a very special man.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.160
 - I think the-

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.000
 - But then there are other theories.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.880
 - The suggestion is that he had a lot of opium

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.680
 mixed in with it to kind of take the edge off a little bit.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.520
 - Okay.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.480
 - Because there was a guy in the 18th century

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.520
 described the effects of hemlock.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.720
 And there was a guy called Fergus Cadd,

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.920
 and he was living in the village of Talisca,

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.000
 and he mistakenly ate some hemlock roots

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.880
 thinking it was carrots.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.960
 And he said, his eyes did roll about,

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.760
 his countenance became very pale,

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.600
 his sight had almost failed him,

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.880
 the frame of his body was all in a strange convulsion,

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.560
 and his pudenda retired so inwardly

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.680
 that there was no discerning

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.320
 whether he had been male or female.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.520
 - Okay, out.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.360
 - But it was quite funny,

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.200
 it would make you convulse and stuff.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.320
 - Was he all right in the end?

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.360
 - This guy actually got better.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.720
 They basically, they gave him loads of stuff

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.480
 to make him vomit and make him shit himself

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.960
 until it all got out of his system,

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.040
 and he just about survived.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.640
 - What about his pudenda?

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.960
 (all laughing)

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.040
 Did they reinflate?

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.160
 - Not recounted.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.000
 (all laughing)

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.360
 Don't get the wrong, the important stuff.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.600
 - That's interesting about the opium

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.040
 because that kind of suggested

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.760
 it's like the equivalent of a last meal

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:06.800
 when you're on death row.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.160
 It's like, you're gonna be drinking this,

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.160
 what would you like as your mixer?

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.000
 - Yeah.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.840
 - What do you want in there to make it go down nicely

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:13.680
 at the end?

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.920
 - Can I have a hemlock and opium?

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.640
 Oh, we've already got Pepsi, is that okay?

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.480
 (all laughing)

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.160
 - Opium Max, unfortunately.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.080
 - Well, we should say what he was sentenced to death for.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.920
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:23.760
 - So.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.680
 - Corrupting the youth.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.640
 - Corrupting the youth and also impiety.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.360
 And he'd been teaching young people critical thinking,

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.840
 which he was frowned on,

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.680
 and he'd also probably not been taking religion

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.640
 completely seriously,

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.920
 and Athens was a very religious society.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.200
 And also, the other sort of context is like,

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.040
 Athens had had this really rough time.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.480
 It was sort of, it was in the golden age of democracy,

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.960
 but they'd just been really walloped in a war

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.720
 by the Persians, and it was a very rough time.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.880
 And there's a theory that people were willing

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:53.960
 to put up with Socrates,

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.760
 who famously asked provocative questions,

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.440
 didn't accept the established version of things,

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.880
 like he was a provocateur, he was a thinker.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.640
 And there was a theory that when it was going fine

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.400
 for Athens, people were willing to put up with that.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.720
 And then when Athens was really doing badly,

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.480
 people said, "This is subversive now.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.360
 "So you're gonna have to knock it off."

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.200
 - Interesting.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.720
 - He was tried for that, you know?

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.520
 He was tried by a jury, and it was a massive jury.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.120
 It's not like you're a classic 12 angry people.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.480
 It is 501 jury members.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.800
 - The Levi's jury.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.120
 - The Levi's jury.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.440
 (all laughing)

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.280
 - Absolutely.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.200
 And it was, the one extra is so that you don't get a tie

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.640
 when it comes to the fighting.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.600
 - It'd be bad luck to get 250 all, wouldn't it?

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.920
 (all laughing)

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:35.760
 - Exactly.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.280
 He ended up with a close margin, 280 voted,

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.400
 that he was guilty versus 221.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.600
 - It's not that close.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.880
 - Well, I guess it's--

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.360
 - It's thump it in a modern democracy,

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.520
 that's a resounding mandate.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:48.920
 - Okay, well he got thumped.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.600
 Well, what's even crazier is that he lost it, 280 to 221.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.920
 That was just to find him guilty.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.520
 Then there was another vote to see

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.760
 what the sentence should be.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.040
 He said, "Well, I think you should give me

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.360
 "free lunch for life."

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.920
 Like he was a joker, right?

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.520
 That pissed off the members of the jury,

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.960
 including jury members who said that he was innocent.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.200
 And even they voted for the death sentence,

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.720
 because I was so pissed off by that joke that he made.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:11.560
 - Yeah.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.760
 - I think it's a weird thing to ask the newly guilty party,

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.480
 what do you think your punishment should be?

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.560
 It's a bit like asking a toddler, isn't it?

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.400
 - Yeah.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.880
 - But maybe that was a little bit like twist,

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.200
 playing your own game, Mr. Socrates.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.200
 You're the one always asking us bloody questions,

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.480
 rather than giving us answers.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.000
 Well, we'll ask you a question.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.760
 - Did anyone vote for the free lunches for life?

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.400
 (all laughing)

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.000
 - To be fair, he did get free lunches for life, probably.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.840
 - Oh, yeah.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:38.680
 - I mean, I don't imagine he had to pay

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.680
 for the hemlock and opium.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.480
 - Maybe it was his clever way of saying,

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.440
 I think I should be put to death in a couple of days,

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.440
 but that I should get the food in the prison in that time.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.920
 Like, there was his clever way of saying,

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.880
 yes, put me to death.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.200
 - Yeah, it's gotta be a clever way of saying something,

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.320
 'cause that was what he did, wasn't it?

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.240
 - Well, actually, like, you know what?

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.800
 He was sentenced to death,

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.040
 but then his mates bribed the prison guards and said,

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.480
 we'll get you out of here.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.440
 And he said, now you're all right.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.280
 - Yeah.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.560
 - I'll just take my punishment.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.400
 - Really?

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.240
 - Yeah.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.160
 - And his idea was that the law of Athens

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.160
 didn't protect him all the way through his life.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.640
 And so it would be inconsistent to say,

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.960
 well, now I think that because the laws are against me,

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.440
 I shouldn't follow them anymore.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:19.280
 - Bit ungrateful.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.120
 - That is good.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.080
 And he was 70 as well.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.240
 So going on the Lamb would probably,

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.520
 I mean, just surviving in ancient Greece,

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.440
 outside Athens was probably hard.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.800
 - Yeah, he must have been in terrible shape.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.280
 Ancient Greece aged 70, 71.

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.640
 - Tom Cruise is 63.

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.080
 So let's put this in context.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.120
 Socrates was only a few years older than Tom Cruise is now.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:42.320
 So Socrates's method was really good.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.280
 You know, you'd say,

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.120
 so what do you,

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.920
 you just get somewhere into a conversation.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.800
 So what do you think about this matter or another?

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:48.760
 And they'd say their opinion.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.160
 And then he would slowly unravel them.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.000
 - Oh yeah.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:52.840
 - And anytime they said something,

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:53.680
 he said, well, hang on,

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.480
 you said just a moment ago that this other thing was true.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.320
 So how can those both be true?

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.160
 And you would end up with both of you

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.640
 in a state of aporia,

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.600
 where neither of you can further define the idea

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.960
 that is under discussion.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.960
 And there are lots of anecdotes written about Socrates

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.920
 getting into conversation with people who end up just saying

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.400
 to him, sorry, I have to go.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.680
 I don't, I don't, I have nothing, I have nothing more to say.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.040
 - I want my way to work.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.160
 - He's basically like a charity mugger outside the station.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.640
 So just one minute.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.680
 - What do you think of free speech?

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.200
 - Did he get punched too much?

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.480
 Was he, was he ever?

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.080
 - I can imagine you're in the groceries

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.440
 and you're behind Socrates

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.000
 and he's questioning the seller, you know.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.600
 - Would you punch someone for that?

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:34.560
 Maybe try to engage Dan.

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:36.320
 - You should see him in the 10 items

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.560
 off your line.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.920
 - What is an item?

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.480
 That's a bunch of grapes.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.600
 Is that one item?

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.680
 Is that 12 items?

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.920
 - He did used to cost people in the gym quite a lot

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:48.880
 when they were exercising,

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.240
 which maybe isn't a good idea

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.000
 if you want to avoid being punched.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.160
 - If he was in the gym causing ruckus and starting fights,

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.000
 I actually think he would have held up on his own

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.440
 because we do picture Socrates

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.240
 as this older philosopher walking around barefooted.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.640
 - You know how I picture him?

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.440
 Exactly how he is in Bill and Ted's excellent adventure.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.440
 - Yes.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:08.120
 - And I also pronounce him Socrates

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:08.960
 because of the time.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.480
 - Socrates, yeah, exactly.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.680
 We picture him as this philosopher,

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.960
 but actually he was a decorated military hero.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.280
 He went all the way up to 48.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.720
 He was still going to battles.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.240
 He was still in front line.

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.560
 And I just didn't know that about him at all.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.880
 I've just had this old man philosopher in my head.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.800
 - But it does raise some questions

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.720
 because so the three main people in his life

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.720
 he wrote about him were Aristophanes, Xenophon and Plato.

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.440
 So a huge amount from Xenophon.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.360
 And I hadn't realized he saved Xenophon

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.640
 in the middle of battle.

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.080
 So in the Peloponnesian Wars Xenophon was dying.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.920
 It's a little bit like the two little boys story.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.520
 Xenophon's lying there dying.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:45.320
 He trots up says, "Do you think I'd leave you dying?"

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.480
 Tosses Xenophon over his shoulder

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.520
 and carries him out of battle with one hand

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.760
 while fighting people with the other.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.120
 - I thought they both had a wooden horse or something.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.160
 - Yeah, that's the Trojan War you're thinking of.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.880
 (laughing)

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.400
 - No way, did you just make that joke?

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.760
 That's incredible.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.360
 What is the two little boys' story?

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.880
 - Yes, they start off with a wooden horse

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.120
 but you've obviously never made it to verse two

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.600
 where they go into real battle.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.960
 - Yet they grow up, do they grow apart

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:13.800
 and then they come back together

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:14.960
 and one of them saves the other's life.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:17.120
 - Yeah, it does ring a bell now.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.200
 - It's a tear-jerker.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.760
 Anyway, then Xenophon wrote loads of really

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.880
 obsequious shit about him for the next 50 years

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:23.480
 but of course he did, he saved his life.

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.680
 - And we also got a lot from Plato

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.800
 'cause these are all his students, right?

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.920
 And Plato writes all the really smart things

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.840
 that Socrates thought.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.520
 But actually, it kind of starts off like that

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:38.320
 but then towards the end, it's just whatever Plato thinks.

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.720
 And he's like, oh, yeah.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.800
 Yeah, Socrates thought that Tremera the best team

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.880
 in League Two this season.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:46.880
 Yeah.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.400
 So he's just like, you never know where Socrates ends

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.880
 and where Plato starts.

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:54.240
 - Is it right that there's no written stuff by Socrates?

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.080
 There's no record of any of that.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.400
 - He hated writing.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.760
 - He was against it.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.200
 - He thought it would ruin people's memories.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.040
 - So it has proved.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.520
 - And the well done hit, called it.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.560
 - In fact, that's the reason that a lot of historians

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.440
 apparently really love the Bill and Ted movie

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:09.240
 because in it, you can't understand what he's saying

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.440
 and that is very on point with the fact

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.520
 that we don't know anything that he actually said.

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:14.360
 - Right.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.960
 - So it's a perfect representation of Socrates.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:17.800
 - Okay.

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.600
 - I haven't seen it, but I am gonna counter the claim

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.240
 that it's a perfect representation of Socrates,

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.080
 nonetheless.

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:23.920
 - Yeah.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:24.760
 - Is that fair?

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:25.600
 - No, not fair.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.440
 - Okay, sorry.

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.560
 - Most triumphant movie.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.400
 - Was there a Mrs. Socrates?

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.240
 - Yes, there was.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.060
 - Yes.

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:34.600
 - She was called Zanthipe, saying it right.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:35.880
 - Very useful for us at the moment

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:38.360
 'cause we're researching the X series of QI.

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:39.200
 - Right.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.040
 - As is Xenophon, actually.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:40.880
 - Yes.

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:45.200
 - So they had three boys and they lived in near poverty

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.440
 while Socrates went around the city

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.400
 asking people weird questions.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:50.840
 Does this remind you of anyone?

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:51.920
 (laughing)

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:52.880
 - Dad Shriver.

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:53.720
 - Three boys.

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:54.560
 - Yeah.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:55.400
 - Yeah, near poverty.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.760
 (laughing)

00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.040
 - You're always just going around

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:01.280
 asking people weird questions while Fenn is saying,

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:02.800
 we need to sort out this or that.

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:03.640
 - Yes.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:04.920
 - If Dad's the great philosopher of our time,

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:05.760
 we are really.

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:06.800
 (laughing)

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.640
 - Just another Zanthipe thing.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.400
 This is a mystery that I got too deeply into,

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.480
 so I'm gonna drag you down.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.520
 Zanthipe was the original Shrew.

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:15.600
 She's known throughout medieval history.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.760
 She's the Shrewish wife.

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.000
 She's mentioned in the Taming of the Shrew as the archetype.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.400
 And then a Shrew was discovered in the late 19th century

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.560
 and it was named Zanthipe's Shrew

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.040
 by the person who discovered it.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.280
 Obviously after Zanthipe.

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:32.880
 But get this, its other name is the yellow-footed Shrew.

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.520
 Now, as I'm sure you all know,

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:37.800
 Zanthos in Greek is yellow, golden yellow,

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:41.360
 and Podes, Pe, Pe, is like feet.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:45.880
 So Zanthipe sort of means yellow-footed

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:47.560
 and it's got yellow feet,

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:49.720
 but it's named after Zanthipe the woman.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:50.680
 What's going on?

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.280
 - That's amazing.

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.640
 I got lost halfway through.

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.880
 - Has anyone followed?

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:58.240
 - So they named it after Zanthipe,

00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.680
 the woman yellow-footed.

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.880
 - No, 'cause she's a Shrewish woman.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.040
 - But if you twist the words a bit,

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.440
 it sounds like it's got yellow feet in Greek.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.040
 - Exactly. - That's crazy.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:07.880
 That's really good.

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:08.720
 - Thank you, Andy.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:09.720
 - Are you the first person to make that link?

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.800
 - I think I might be.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:12.640
 - Wow.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.520
 - Yeah, this is going to blow some stuff open.

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:16.160
 - Yeah, let's get in touch with our PR.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.480
 Let's get that out there.

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.720
 (laughing)

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:20.960
 - We don't have a PR.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:24.840
 - Danny Express though, if you're listening.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:28.520
 - I have a favorite Socrates sort of thing that he did.

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.160
 It's the Socrates freeze.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.600
 Did you read about this?

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.640
 It's written about, so Plato writes about it

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:34.480
 in the Symposium.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.920
 Basically, he used to get stuck with ideas in his head

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:38.120
 that he really needed to think about.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:40.480
 And when he did, he just stopped or moved himself

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.320
 to a convenient out of the way spot

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.120
 and just remained there completely still

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.880
 no matter what he was on his way to.

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.200
 So in this, he was on his way to a dinner party

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.200
 and he suddenly had an idea.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:52.520
 He just stands on the porch and just stays silent.

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:54.120
 And that's how he lived his life.

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:57.000
 When I walk into a room and can't remember why I went in,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.160
 I do the exact same thing.

00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:59.000
 - You just stop.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.640
 - Just stand there and look around and go,

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.240
 what was it I came in here for?

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:05.600
 - Right, maybe you are the great philosopher of our time.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.920
 - I think we all know that's true.

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:08.680
 - I think that's probably true.

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:10.400
 - But you're saying Socrates is standing on that porch

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.040
 going, who the fuck's house is this?

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:13.960
 - Yeah, that's what I reckon.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:16.640
 My favorite Socrates is the--

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.720
 - I know who it's gonna be.

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.360
 - My favorite Socrates, who is it, Anna?

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.200
 Do you think?

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.920
 - It's gonna be the other famous Socrates in history,

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:23.760
 the football player.

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:24.600
 - The footballer.

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.440
 - Oh, nice.

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.600
 - From Brazil in the '80s.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.720
 He was known as the smartest player

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.360
 in the Brazilian football team.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:34.320
 - Question, was he known as Socrates

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:35.720
 before people thought he was smart?

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.280
 Or was he called Socrates and then people thought he was--

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:39.880
 - He was known as Socrates from a very young age.

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:42.360
 People in Brazil, they'll often get a nickname.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:45.360
 - But I think actually his dad was a self-taught,

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.680
 very poor but self-taught guy,

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.720
 and he named him Socrates after the philosopher,

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.400
 'cause I think his brothers were called Sophocles

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.080
 and some other very lesser Greek person.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.120
 - Yeah, so his dad was a philosopher,

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:59.320
 like he studied philosophy, and he had lots of books.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.120
 And basically he was quite sad actually,

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.840
 'cause there was a coup d'etat in Brazil,

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.560
 and when the army came in,

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:08.200
 they forced everyone to burn all their books.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.280
 And Socrates as a child, the footballer,

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:13.120
 he watched his dad burning all the books in his library

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.400
 and imagine how painful that was for him,

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:18.000
 because that was what he loved, he loved his books.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.640
 - And did that then turn it onto football?

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.760
 He said, "Well, if I can't read 'cause of this coup,

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:22.960
 "I'm gonna become a footballer."

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.640
 - No, he was just a great footballer really,

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:26.520
 'cause he also had a medical degree.

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:28.080
 - Which he got while he was playing football.

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:29.720
 - Yeah, he was super smart.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:30.560
 - He was amazing.

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.760
 - And then when he got towards the end of his career,

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:34.280
 he got into politics as well,

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:38.000
 and he said, "If this military dictatorship doesn't leave

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.520
 "and if they don't allow free elections,

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:42.000
 "then I'm gonna leave and I'm gonna go and play in Italy."

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:42.840
 - And what happened?

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:43.680
 - He went to play in Italy.

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.000
 - All right, that's so good, so what a letdown.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.880
 I thought you were gonna say, "And the government, back down."

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:50.800
 - So in fairness, they did back down,

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.040
 eventually he played one year in Furentina,

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:55.920
 and then the next year they did back down and he came back.

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.960
 - But they didn't just abandon the dictatorship

00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:59.920
 because it's to get him back into the country?

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.040
 - No, they didn't, but he was quite instrumental.

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.560
 - He was influential, yeah, he was such a big campaigner

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.160
 for all that, he was such a great guy,

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:07.600
 and he made them all wear shirts saying,

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.400
 "Democracy" in their big,

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:11.640
 this is when he played for the Corinthians,

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:15.040
 which is also really cool because obviously the Corinthians,

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:18.400
 great allies of Athens, allies of Socrates,

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:19.880
 the Socrates fought with them

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:21.320
 and the Peloponnesian Wars.

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:23.040
 - Anna, have you taken Dan's coincidence pills?

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.760
 This is insane, this is insane, I love it.

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:33.680
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:35.640
 - My fact is that a lot of people in the UK

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:38.840
 have their heating controlled by BBC Radio 4.

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:42.840
 - That is amazing.

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:44.480
 - Seem unlikely, doesn't it?

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:45.720
 - This is mad.

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:47.680
 This, I should say, was sent in as an audience fact,

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:50.600
 it's sent in by Bill Welch, so thank you, Bill.

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:54.040
 Right, so you will have electricity in your homes, right?

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.320
 - Not me with my poverty situation going on.

00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:00.840
 I'm out on the streets anyway, so it doesn't matter.

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:03.760
 - So, your electricity is controlled by a meter,

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.600
 and it might be a smart meter if you've had it upgraded,

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:06.640
 or it might be an old-fashioned one,

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.600
 which measures the current going into your home

00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:10.520
 and you pay for the amount you use,

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:12.240
 but you also pay maybe a different amount

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.520
 at different times of day.

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.680
 You know, at night, there's more electricity

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.440
 that's going unused, and there's more wind turbines

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:21.080
 going around, so there's lots of cheap electricity available.

00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:24.240
 Some old-fashioned electricity meters

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.440
 can switch between different tariffs,

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.120
 different rates they're charging you,

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:31.440
 and the way they do it, switching twice a day,

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.200
 is that they are set up to receive a signal

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:38.200
 embedded in the BBC Radio 4 long-wave radio, so it's nuts.

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:42.880
 Twice a day, Radio 4 sends out this message from Droitwich,

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:44.200
 which is in the middle of the country,

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.560
 and it's a transmitter that can reach the whole country,

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:47.960
 and it just goes, "Blip!"

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:50.080
 And hundreds of thousands of homes across the country

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.760
 switch onto the new tariff

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.560
 that they're paying for their electricity.

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:55.960
 And this system, it dates back, I think, about 40 years.

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:58.440
 It's only meant to last another month or so,

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.280
 and they're meant to be shutting it down in June 2025,

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.280
 but still, they've got hundreds of thousands of homes

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:05.120
 where they haven't switched over the meters yet, so...

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:06.240
 - We don't know what's going to happen.

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.080
 - No. - Yeah.

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.920
 - 'Cause at a time of recording,

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.040
 they're still going to cut it off.

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:11.560
 - I know. - But good luck.

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.200
 They are trying to switch people over,

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.840
 but they have to accelerate pretty fast, too, right?

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:16.840
 - Yeah, switching people over at several thousand a day,

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:18.480
 or they're trying to. - But it's hard, is it?

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:20.120
 - It's hard, yeah. - And there is a petition,

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:21.760
 just in case anyone's listening and thinks,

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:23.960
 "Hang on, I don't want this to happen on change.org."

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.040
 Do check it out, 'cause it's...

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:28.320
 Like, I think it's gonna happen.

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:29.960
 I think there's time.

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:32.120
 - Yeah, and if you're listening to Radio 4

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:33.880
 and you're listening out for this noise,

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:35.160
 you're not gonna hear it. - No.

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.360
 (laughing)

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:39.040
 - Because it's not a bloop, not really.

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:44.040
 It's the signal is sent by the phase information of the wave.

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.160
 So you've got this radio wave sort of pulsing

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:49.320
 through the country, and it's always the same frequency

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:51.600
 so that you can pick it up on your radio.

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.760
 But if sometimes they put little changes

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:57.720
 in where the peaks and the troughs are in this wave,

00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:00.760
 and those tiny changes are the things that it picks up,

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:03.840
 and your radio would normally strip away

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.360
 any of those differences.

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:08.160
 Any radio that you own, you would never hear this.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.560
 Now, in theory, you could build a radio,

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.560
 like a ham radio, that would pick it up,

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:13.520
 but even if you did that,

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.040
 it would just be the tiniest little hum

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.760
 you would have. - Right.

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:17.600
 That's interesting.

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:21.200
 So if you are at home, and your radio is off,

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.640
 you've turned off Radio 4,

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:25.200
 that's, it can't get through the radio, right?

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.800
 Like, that's it, no.

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:27.920
 - That's not how radio works.

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:29.720
 - Then you pay loads of extra money for heating.

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:30.680
 It's such a stupid system,

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:33.280
 so you don't have to use their radios on all night.

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:36.320
 - Your electricity meter is a radio.

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:39.280
 - It contains a tiny little rod with iron in it,

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:40.600
 and that's an antennae,

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:45.000
 and that can receive 198 kilohertz radio waves,

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.520
 and any signal that comes in on that radio wave

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.600
 will be picked up by that little rod,

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:51.880
 and so that is kind of acting like a radio.

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:54.080
 - But you can't get a test match special

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:55.920
 through your electricity meter.

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:57.480
 - Okay, so if I lean up close,

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:58.760
 I won't hear the arches theme tune.

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:00.280
 Okay, that's good to know.

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:02.720
 - A test match special isn't played on radio for anyways.

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:03.560
 - No, it's all right.

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:04.400
 - Isn't it?

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.240
 - They got rid of it a few years ago.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.400
 - Okay, oh my God.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.720
 - I think that's the saddest part of all this stuff actually,

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:12.120
 the test match special isn't on radio for anymore.

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:13.960
 - Right, not even long wave.

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:14.960
 'Cause the reason they put it,

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.120
 like we should say,

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:19.160
 most people listen to FM all probably now digital, right?

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:21.600
 But long wave was 'cause there were about 90,000 homes

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:23.640
 in the country which couldn't get FM radio,

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.940
 and you would have to carpet the country with transmitters

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:28.240
 to make that signal available absolutely everywhere.

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:29.080
 So for those homes,

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:30.760
 they just had the long wave signal,

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:32.920
 which it's different that it'd get anywhere.

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:35.600
 And also if you then have a program that lasts

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.640
 for five days like test match special,

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.120
 you just shove it on long wave.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.400
 So you don't have to stop all other radio for for a week.

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:45.360
 - But this is why the heating has had to be stopped, right?

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.440
 It's not about the heating systems changing over.

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:50.640
 It's about radio for saying no one's using long wave anymore.

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:52.560
 So also this will be probably news

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:55.080
 to maybe five people after the country.

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:57.440
 They're stopping broadcasting over long wave.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:58.640
 And this is just the knock on effect

00:20:58.640 --> 00:20:59.480
 where these guys are going,

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.040
 "Hang on, that's gonna stop my heating."

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:03.320
 Although it doesn't really affect that many people.

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:06.880
 For instance, if you go to Curry's and try and buy a radio,

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:09.440
 I think of all the radios they sell in the entire country,

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:10.960
 there's only one of them

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:13.680
 that will pick up long wave signals these days.

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:14.520
 - Really, is that true?

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:15.640
 - We're shooting ourselves in the foot

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:16.640
 by turning off long wave.

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:19.620
 What about when the internet stops, when it breaks,

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:22.160
 we're gonna need a good reliable backup system

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.480
 and that can be long wave.

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:24.920
 - Yeah, well, that's probably there, right?

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:25.920
 For us to still use.

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:26.760
 - No, it's not.

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:27.880
 This is the weird thing.

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:28.720
 The whole point of it

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:32.440
 is that they can't get these handmade glass valves.

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:33.640
 There are these big glass valves

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.600
 which make the long wave signal work.

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:40.160
 And the BBC bought the entire global supply some years ago,

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:41.080
 which was 10.

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.400
 (laughing)

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:44.240
 You need two of them

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.640
 to make the transmitter work, right?

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:46.680
 - How long did they last?

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.280
 - Well, between one and 10 years.

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:49.120
 - Okay.

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:49.960
 (laughing)

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:52.880
 - You know, so then down to their last two now.

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:55.240
 They've got like, they've got no spares in the cupboard.

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:56.480
 They're using their last two valves.

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.520
 When one of those goes, the system goes.

00:21:58.520 --> 00:21:59.360
 - Yeah.

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:01.160
 - One interesting thing about the long wave,

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.240
 especially this thing in Dritewitch is,

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.960
 you have to send out a frequency,

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:09.000
 and it has to be exactly 198 kilohertz, right?

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.160
 But how do you make sure

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.600
 that the frequency is always the same

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:14.720
 when you're sending this signal out?

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:15.560
 - Yeah.

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:16.400
 - I don't know.

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:19.480
 - Well, they used to have a thing called an SN ring,

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.760
 and it was made of quartz.

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.680
 And if you apply voltage to quartz,

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:26.320
 it vibrates at a very precise frequency.

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:28.640
 And you had to, it had to be in a perfect ring,

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:31.760
 and you had to sort of hang it up by nylon threads.

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:33.240
 (laughing)

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:36.160
 - It's so cool, the technology we used to have.

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:39.040
 - And one of these existed inside the Dritewitch thing,

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:41.440
 so that you would always have the exact frequency.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.000
 And now they do it with rubidium.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.720
 So they get some rubidium atoms, like a gas.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:51.400
 And rubidium atoms, rubidium 87, the isotope,

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:54.080
 they always transition between two energy levels.

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.800
 This is quantum physics now,

00:22:55.800 --> 00:23:00.800
 which are exactly 6.834682610 gigahertz apart.

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:03.800
 And that's basically an atomic clock.

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:04.960
 That's what that is.

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:06.880
 - Yeah, 'cause this is how we used to keep time in Paris,

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:08.600
 wasn't it, with the quartz before they came up

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:09.440
 with the better version?

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:10.280
 - Absolutely.

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:11.560
 That's how my cassio works.

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:12.400
 - Yes.

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.680
 (laughing)

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:14.600
 - Actually, I'm not even joking,

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:16.200
 it has a small piece of quartz in.

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.520
 That's how a digital watch.

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.040
 - So yours works in the same way

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:20.480
 that the SN ring would work.

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.600
 Obviously, you don't have rubidium atoms in there.

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:23.560
 - I didn't spring for that.

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:25.280
 I saw it on Amazon as an option,

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:26.680
 it's like, but it was three quid more.

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:27.800
 And I thought, no, stuff that.

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:30.360
 - But the atomic clock inside Droughtwitch,

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:33.280
 not lose more than one second every 3,000 years,

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:36.240
 if it was a watch, which is pretty good.

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:38.080
 Although we're now up to with atomic clocks,

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:41.400
 ones that won't lose a second in 30 billion years.

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:43.240
 - Yeah, we've got two perfectionists here, haven't we?

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.400
 It's like having to find the next digit of pi.

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:46.240
 - Yeah.

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.080
 - Who cares?

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:47.920
 We've gone far enough.

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:49.460
 - A second every 3,000 years is still,

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:52.440
 if you'd started that when we invented farming

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:54.400
 and came to now, it would still be within three seconds,

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:56.040
 which I think is good.

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:57.560
 I think that's good.

00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:59.600
 - Socrates would be almost a second late

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:00.640
 if you had a meeting with him.

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.240
 - It doesn't matter, he's frozen half a mile

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.080
 down the road anyway.

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:05.320
 (laughing)

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:10.040
 - I had to refresh my memory from the old GCSE

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:12.920
 in physics of how on earth all these waves bloody work.

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:17.080
 And so, in case you need it, long wave hugs the ground,

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:19.160
 which I just like the idea that that's why it can get

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:20.960
 to all of those places is that,

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.880
 like some sort of weird cartoon character

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:25.600
 just clings just above the ground

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:28.360
 so it can gallop over mountains and humps and everything.

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:30.560
 - So if you're in a valley, you still get it?

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:31.880
 - Exactly.

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:34.120
 - Is it bouncing off the sky?

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:35.840
 - Sometimes it is, but more important

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:37.240
 with the bouncing of the sky.

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:39.360
 And I think this is the very cool thing,

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:41.400
 is short wave reception.

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:44.280
 So short wave relies on the ionosphere,

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:49.280
 which is the ring in our atmosphere of charged ions.

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:52.040
 And the reason they're charged is because the sunlight

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:55.000
 bashes into atoms in the daytime in our atmosphere

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.600
 and it causes them all to react with each other

00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:58.160
 and lose electrons and they become ions.

00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:00.280
 So it's all very electrically charged.

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:02.480
 And we use that ionosphere short wave

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:06.280
 to bounce radio signal up and then back down to us.

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:08.320
 What I quite like about that is that that means

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:12.080
 that you'd get much better reception at night on the radio

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:14.880
 just because of how the ionosphere works.

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:17.280
 So basically in the daytime,

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:19.560
 the ionosphere has been all charged up by the sun.

00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:22.520
 So it's lots of ions, like free electrons,

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:24.600
 wandering around looking for a partner.

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:26.360
 And so the radio wave goes up,

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:29.040
 like someone going into a ballroom full of dancers

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.160
 looking for partners.

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:31.200
 - The sexy stuff, yeah, yeah.

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.040
 - Yeah.

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:34.800
 And it's harder in the daytime to get through that ballroom

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:36.760
 because the dancers keep on trying to dance with you.

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:38.040
 They're these free ions being like,

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:40.320
 "Hey, pair up with me, pair up with me."

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:42.480
 But in the nighttime, they all chill out,

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.200
 they recombine with their normal partners

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:46.600
 'cause the sunlight's gone away and stopped stirring them up.

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:48.960
 So the radio signal of your short wave radio

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.920
 can just go straight through the dance floor

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:53.240
 without anyone assaulting them for it.

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:54.880
 - Which is all well and good,

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:57.000
 but you can't play cricket at the nighttime.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.120
 So the terrible irony is you can never listen

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:02.320
 to "Test Met Special" with a good signal.

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.840
 - And that is the ultimate point is it's pointless.

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:07.040
 What good radios on a three in the morning?

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:09.360
 - "Droit Witch" played a part in D-Day.

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:10.200
 - Did it?

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:12.040
 - Yes, it did.

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:15.880
 - The D in D-Day stands for "Droit Witch" day, yeah.

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:19.800
 The date of the landings was broadcast

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:21.480
 from the "Droit Witch" transmitter

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:24.000
 because there were people in France, the resistance,

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.360
 they were getting signals from Britain

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:28.680
 and how do you send a signal all the way to France?

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:29.640
 Well, it's pretty difficult

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:32.240
 unless you have a big old tower that can send long wave.

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:33.960
 And so they did and they could pick up

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:36.200
 the BBC French service from there

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:39.480
 and they played like a poem by Paul Vellan, I think.

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:41.360
 And when they heard that poem,

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:43.360
 they knew that this was the time to,

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:46.880
 basically what they did was they would kind of cause ruckus

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:48.680
 with the Germans and like, you know,

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:49.840
 just be a pain in the arse.

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:50.840
 - If you're gonna block the roadways,

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:51.680
 blow them up now.

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:52.880
 - Yeah, exactly, yeah, yeah.

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:55.200
 Just keep them occupied in various,

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.920
 oh, ironically, you're the one who's occupied,

00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:01.440
 but keep them occupied while we're going onto the beaches.

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:03.400
 - So the signal was like, create a distraction.

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:04.240
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:05.080
 - Cool.

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:05.920
 - Can we say what the line was?

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:06.760
 It's so cool.

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:08.760
 So as you said, James, it was a poem by Paul Vellan

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:11.760
 who was a 19th century, quite avant-garde gay poet.

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:12.760
 Like, he was quite--

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:15.160
 - Was he the one who had an affair with Rambo, I think?

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:16.000
 - I think he did.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 - Not Rambo, the--

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.360
 (laughing)

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:19.560
 - That's looking interesting.

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:20.960
 - I was told me more.

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:21.800
 Who's Rambo?

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:23.560
 - Arthur Rambo was the poet as well.

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:24.400
 Yeah.

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:25.240
 - Oh, God.

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:26.680
 - They were like the romantic poets of France.

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:27.640
 - Yeah, they were terrific.

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:29.160
 - That's a disappointing movie night

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:31.000
 when I've rented that movie.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.200
 - Rambo, First Blood.

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:33.800
 (laughing)

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:36.040
 - Actually, Total Eclipse starring Leonardo DiCaprio

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:38.000
 as Rambo is a great film, Dan.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:38.840
 - Wow.

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:40.200
 - Yeah, there you go.

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.600
 - And so the poem starts.

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:45.760
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:48.400
 "The long sobs of autumn violins

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:51.480
 "wound my heart with a monotonous langer."

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:52.720
 Very poetic.

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:54.400
 So when they broadcast the first half,

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:56.480
 that was a signal to the French resistance.

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:57.840
 Invasion's gonna be within two weeks.

00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:59.000
 You've got two weeks to get ready.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:27:59.840
 - Right.

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:01.240
 - And then they broadcast the second half of that line,

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:03.280
 which was, you've got 48 hours.

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:05.720
 Like, the French service broadcast all of these phrases,

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.400
 some of which were meaningful,

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:10.840
 like, "Molas's tomorrow will bring forth cognac."

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:12.320
 That just went into France,

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:14.280
 as it might've been done in Morse code,

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:15.680
 but it was- - Okay.

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:18.720
 - And then, "John has a long moustache."

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:20.880
 And some of these phrases were meaningful to the resistance,

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.000
 and a lot of them were nonsense,

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.680
 just to confuse the Germans, basically.

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:25.280
 - How interesting, right, cool, that's clever.

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:26.680
 - And the Germans knew the significance

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:27.720
 of the Verland poem.

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:30.360
 There was an officer, a German intelligence officer,

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:33.120
 who said, "Okay, the invasion's coming within 48 hours."

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:34.760
 And he passed the message on,

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:36.640
 but it did not get through to the army

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:38.960
 who were actually in charge of Normandy,

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:41.080
 and trying to man the beaches.

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:42.240
 - Did he go shortwave?

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:43.320
 - I didn't. - Grewed it up.

00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:45.280
 - Yeah, the warning wasn't passed on.

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:46.400
 - That's mad, really.

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:48.640
 - It's huge, that's a big counterfactual.

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:51.120
 - Well, the amazing thing is also the Germans

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.680
 sent some signals from Droitwich as well.

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:56.080
 - Did they? - They had someone on the inside,

00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:58.840
 and so they could use the Droitwich transmitter

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:01.560
 to send their own signals to people in France.

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:03.960
 - Right, there was a German spy in Droitwich.

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:04.800
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:05.640
 - They don't know who it was,

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:07.840
 they assume it was someone working at the BBC or something.

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:09.160
 - That's crazy. - Wow, that's cool.

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:11.240
 I like that Longwave can go through water as well,

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:13.680
 and that was submarines would use Longwave

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:15.680
 to get their radio, their Radio 4,

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:17.280
 they would literally use to get it.

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:19.480
 - I think they still do. - Yeah, they still do,

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:21.560
 but obviously at the end of this month, they weren't, right?

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:22.960
 - What are they gonna do?

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:24.360
 - I don't know, I don't obviously got a new thing,

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:26.120
 they're gonna swap too, but that was the thing,

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:28.280
 I'm sure we've said it, where in wartime,

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:31.400
 you would make sure that England was still there,

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:33.000
 basically, while you were under water,

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.720
 if Radio 4 was still going.

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:37.200
 - They've probably gone BBC sounds now.

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:40.080
 - That's true, they probably pre-download before they go.

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:43.000
 (all laughing)

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.240
 I do love codes in,

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.840
 I feel like we should do this at some point,

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:47.960
 there's a whole period of an American radio

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:50.080
 where they would put a code for the listener

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:51.720
 at the end of a radio show,

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:53.800
 so it would be like a little bit of Morse code,

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:56.400
 and you had a decoder at home as part of the fan club,

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:58.160
 so we would give little teasers for what's happening

00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:59.600
 in the episode that you were gonna hear

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:00.880
 the next day or the next week.

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:01.960
 - That's a really good idea,

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:04.800
 'cause we know that you listening to this

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:06.440
 almost certainly stop listening

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:09.360
 before we say our email address is at the end,

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:10.880
 'cause we've seen the figures,

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:12.960
 we know when the drop-off comes.

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:14.600
 - Are you saying we should put them in Morse code

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:15.640
 at the start of the podcast?

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:17.840
 - No, I'm saying we put something special at the very end,

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:20.680
 so people are forced to listen to us saying,

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:21.880
 I'm on Instagram.

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:24.800
 - All right, we're gonna do it,

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:26.160
 we can just tell people we'll put something special in.

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:27.120
 - What should we put?

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:27.960
 Crossword?

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:31.720
 - That's the most, that's the most fun,

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:32.540
 I think I've ever heard of.

00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:33.760
 - What about Sudoku?

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:34.600
 - A Sudoku.

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:37.160
 - So I'll do the first box, blank.

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:38.960
 (all laughing)

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:40.600
 You're gonna listen next week.

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:42.960
 - In just 81 episodes time,

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:45.640
 you've made your own Sudoku credit.

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:46.960
 - That's great.

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.880
 - This'll get people listening.

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:51.460
 (upbeat music)

00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:56.560
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:57.840
 and that is my fact.

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:00.520
 My fact this week is that Andy Warhol

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:03.600
 would regularly have his wig cut by a barber

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:05.280
 and then return the following month

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:07.200
 wearing a new longer wig.

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:09.840
 - Sorry, annoying for that barber.

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:11.680
 - Yeah, how did the barber react?

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:13.920
 - Well, this is Andy Warhol we're talking about.

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:15.520
 He, as well as being an artist,

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:17.080
 was an art piece in himself,

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:18.240
 and the barber would have known

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:20.320
 and would have enjoyed what they were doing.

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:23.480
 - And actually, at the moment, if you're a barber,

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:24.840
 you have to sit there waiting

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:27.440
 for your customers to grow hair,

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:29.960
 but if they just come in and buy some hair for you to cut,

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:31.120
 it's giving you more work.

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:32.520
 - Yeah, that's a good point.

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:34.800
 - Yeah, was it so that his friends

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:39.120
 would kind of slowly see his wig get longer and shorter

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:40.480
 so it looked more realistic?

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:41.520
 - Yeah, I think as well,

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:43.440
 like this is one of the most photographed

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:45.240
 socialites in America at the time.

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:48.640
 He wanted to make sure that his look was ever changing.

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.560
 It was sort of in fashion.

00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:52.760
 The wig was a huge part of his life, by the way.

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:54.320
 - 'Cause his wig is a very obvious wig,

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:55.440
 Andy Warhol's, isn't it?

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:57.760
 - Yeah, it's silvery, isn't it?

00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:59.400
 I know you had hundreds of wigs.

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:02.520
 - But iconic, so he basically started going bold

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:05.800
 when he was in his 20s, and he really didn't want this.

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:07.360
 And there's a lot of early art pieces

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:09.320
 where it clearly is playing on his mind.

00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:11.440
 There's a piece that he did called "Bold?"

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:14.280
 Question mark, where he just showed

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:16.920
 someone gradually becoming bold in sketches.

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:18.800
 And so he took it very seriously.

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:21.720
 And there's a huge collection of Andy Warhol wigs

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:22.720
 that are out there now.

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:25.840
 They were all very nicely made by a man

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:28.480
 who was called Paul Bokiccio.

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:29.760
 They were iconic wigs.

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:32.560
 - Yeah, you could buy one in 2006 at auction

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:35.200
 for $10,800 at which time it was

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:37.120
 the most expensive wig ever sold.

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:38.680
 - Oh yeah, has it been overtaken?

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:40.200
 - Three times, do you wanna guess?

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:41.680
 - Oh, yes.

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:42.680
 - Who's Big Wigs?

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:43.520
 - You can get them all.

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:44.360
 - Big Wigs.

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:47.200
 - Marge Simpson?

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:48.040
 - Oh my God.

00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:51.440
 Let's try some real life people.

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:52.600
 - Okay, okay.

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:55.000
 - But Big Wigs is a good name for when I turn this

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.360
 into a channel five format.

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:57.520
 - Yeah, absolutely.

00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:58.960
 - I'll take my usual 10% fee.

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:00.440
 - Yeah, I feel like we might struggle

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:01.440
 after the first episode.

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:03.000
 In fact, after the first question.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.800
 (all laughing)

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:06.360
 - I'm struggling now, I think I'm really famous.

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:07.960
 So I'm thinking of people,

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:10.000
 I'm thinking of iconic weird artists like

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:10.840
 Salvador Dali.

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:12.560
 - I think I'm more famous, very famous.

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:14.040
 - Edna Everage?

00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:15.400
 - Edna Everage.

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:16.480
 - Really good call.

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:17.720
 Michael Jackson.

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:20.840
 - Michael Jackson in at one, $75,000.

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:21.680
 - Where's his wig?

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:22.520
 - Where's his wig?

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:24.280
 - He did wear wigs later on.

00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:26.920
 So he was in a commercial for Pepsi.

00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:27.760
 - Yeah.

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:30.760
 - And there was a fire or he burnt his hair basically

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:32.360
 and he had to wear wigs for a while after that.

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:33.800
 - It was pyrotechnics that went wrong

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:36.560
 during the advert recording and his head lit up.

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:37.400
 He didn't even notice.

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.080
 You can see the footage where he's still dancing

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:41.440
 and his head is just in, yeah.

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:42.480
 Oh, so that's number one.

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.960
 - Are the famous wig wearers, so?

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:47.240
 - Go for more famous people who might have happened

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:49.000
 to have worn wigs at a certain time.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 - Dolly Parton.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.080
 - Close, but no.

00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:53.400
 - Give us one, like one clue that's sort of like.

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:56.120
 - The most famous woman of the 20th century.

00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:57.240
 - Marilyn Monroe.

00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:59.720
 - Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor.

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:01.680
 - Oh, double.

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:02.520
 - Yeah.

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:05.600
 You kind of spoiled the format by getting them so quickly.

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:07.680
 Fill another 24 minutes of the show.

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:11.680
 But it was Elizabeth Taylor's wig in "Clear Patra"

00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:15.960
 went for $16,000 and Marilyn Monroe's wig,

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:18.240
 she wore in "The Misfits," which was her last film.

00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:20.480
 I went for $30,000.

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:21.920
 - Nice.

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:23.920
 - ♪ Da, da, da, da, da ♪

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:27.120
 - Come back next week when we'll desperately be hoping

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:29.080
 for some big news in the wig world.

00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:31.320
 (laughing)

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:34.800
 - So he kept hundreds, didn't he, Andy Warhol?

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:36.320
 In boxes and--

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:37.680
 - Yeah, he was a huge hoarder.

00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:39.200
 - He collected everything in his life.

00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:40.360
 There's a weird, massive art.

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:42.320
 I think there's an Andy Warhol museum somewhere.

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:44.200
 Maybe it's in Pittsburgh, which is where he was from.

00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:45.040
 - Yeah.

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.160
 - But it's got, wherever it is,

00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:49.080
 it's got 50,000 of his things or 100,000, you know,

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:52.080
 sort of many floors of ticket stubs and old.

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:53.520
 - He basically, at the end of every day,

00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:55.400
 he would get a big cardboard box

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:57.640
 and anything that he had left over,

00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:00.680
 like half a sandwich or a smoke cigarette or something,

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:02.840
 he would just pour it all into that box

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:05.000
 and with market time capsule

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.360
 and then just put it to one side.

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:07.200
 - It's a good idea.

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:09.840
 - And the Andy Warhol museum has hundreds of these

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:11.040
 and I don't think they've all been opened.

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:13.480
 - No, so back in 2007, there was a journalist

00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:16.200
 who was invited to see some of the boxes being opened.

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:19.280
 So they had 600 boxes of these things.

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:21.640
 I think only like 80 of them had been opened at that point

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:23.480
 and they had just no idea what you'd find in it.

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:24.600
 So he was there as they opened it

00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:27.360
 and they found an unopened Lionel Richie CD

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:31.280
 and you know, but then they found things

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:34.600
 like a mummified foot that he bought at a sort of sale,

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:37.320
 you know, like a garage sale and that he kept in.

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:39.080
 - This is a format James, I'm sorry,

00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:42.160
 but like when the wig show comes to the end

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:44.200
 of its natural life after many seasons,

00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:48.000
 I think Andy Warhol's big box open is a good,

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.400
 it's like storage walls where you bid against each other

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:52.920
 for what's in a box and you might get a half-eaten sandwich

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:55.240
 or you might get millions of flies, you know?

00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:57.000
 That's a fun concept.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.680
 Are any of them like moving or ticking or?

00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:01.920
 (laughing)

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:05.640
 - It's very much something you can get away with

00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:07.120
 if you're a very famous artist.

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:08.960
 But if I did that as an ordinary human being,

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:10.640
 my friends would think I'd gone completely mad.

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:12.320
 - It's unsustainable for all eight billion of us

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:13.920
 to do this with all of our things.

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:19.120
 - But also the wig became its own thing in his life

00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:20.680
 where it could act as him.

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:23.520
 So there was a whole tour in colleges

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:26.360
 and instead of going, he sent an actor.

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:27.680
 I think the guy had his own hair,

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:29.960
 but he cut it and he colored it to exactly Andy Warhol.

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:32.160
 So iconic that look and he wore dark glasses.

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:33.560
 - Can we say what he was called?

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:34.400
 - Yeah, absolutely.

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:35.640
 - He was called Alan Midget.

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:36.680
 - Yeah, Midget.

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:38.600
 - I'm so sorry for mispronouncing

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:39.920
 something for comic effect.

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:41.000
 (laughing)

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.240
 - Alan Midget.

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:45.480
 - He had an E at the end, but he put that E on.

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:47.120
 It didn't have the originally.

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:48.520
 - Yeah, thank you very much.

00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:51.480
 - And basically people were very annoyed with Andy Warhol

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:54.480
 when they found out that he'd sent Alan Midget in his place

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:56.880
 just like sunglasses in a wig.

00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:57.720
 - Yeah.

00:36:57.720 --> 00:36:59.440
 - Did they know straight away when he came up

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:00.680
 or would they see the whole tour?

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:02.800
 - Basically they screened an incredibly boring film

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:03.880
 that Andy Warhol had shot.

00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:05.360
 And then Andy Warhol's shtick

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:06.840
 was that he didn't answer any questions.

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:08.200
 So you'd have a question and answer session

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:10.000
 where you'd say like two word answers.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.120
 I think people did get pretty quickly.

00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:13.440
 - They eventually did get it.

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:15.040
 And it was a bit confusing.

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:16.920
 And the people around Andy would say,

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:17.760
 isn't it fascinating?

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:19.520
 Some people who'd even met Andy

00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:22.200
 would then meet Paul Midget and say,

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:24.000
 wow, Andy, lovely to see you again.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.960
 And he was like, if enough people around a person

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:27.280
 believe it is the person,

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:29.000
 then they get confused into thinking it is.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000
 And that was the case.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.280
 Andy said they got a better deal

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:34.440
 because actually Midget gave more answers at the talks

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:35.520
 than Andy would have.

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:36.480
 He was more personable.

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:37.520
 He was more likable.

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:38.560
 - Supposedly he was caught

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:40.720
 when he ran out of silver hairspray.

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:42.680
 Alan Midget, I don't know if that's true.

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:44.600
 And people were so annoyed about this when it was discovered

00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:46.920
 that one Oregon college made Andy Warhol swear

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:48.480
 on a Bible that he was Andy Warhol

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:50.880
 before they let him do the event.

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:53.160
 'Cause it was to students, these talks, basically.

00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:54.200
 And I think people had...

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:56.120
 - But it feels better to see the double

00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:58.440
 because you're seeing an Andy Warhol work of art.

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:02.040
 As Dan says, Andy Warhol made himself a work of art, didn't he?

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:04.880
 So it was like everything he did, you had to appreciate.

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:06.680
 And some people didn't get it.

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:08.720
 - This guy is the Socrates of the 20th century.

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:11.560
 I'm sorry, he's going around irritating people.

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:13.840
 - Not answering any questions, only asking them.

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:16.280
 - Yeah, he was a weird guy.

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:18.400
 He did a lot of art, which was about replication

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:20.400
 and uniformity.

00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:22.200
 And so one of his most famous things

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:24.600
 is the paintings of Campbell's soup can.

00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:26.920
 - Yeah, that's what made him famous, really, yeah.

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:30.720
 - But this was 1962, and it was his first big solo show.

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:32.480
 So it was his debut to the art world.

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:33.760
 It was not a success.

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:35.280
 He sold five.

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:36.360
 - Really? - Yeah.

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:38.120
 In fact, I don't even know if he sold five.

00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:40.360
 Like a few of the, two were sold and a few more,

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:41.760
 someone said, "Yeah, keep that back for me."

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:43.960
 You know, it was a failure, I would say.

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:45.440
 And the gallery owner then said,

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:46.600
 "Actually, I'm not going to sell any of these.

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.680
 "I want to keep the series together."

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:49.520
 But I think it's interesting

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:52.080
 that Campbell's didn't know about it,

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:55.000
 because obviously he wouldn't have worn them or anything.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.040
 But then people started wearing Campbell's soup clothing

00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:00.640
 because this work of art had become popular.

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:02.440
 And then Campbell's soup gave him a commission

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:04.960
 to paint a can because their chairman was retiring.

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:06.240
 So they've got this weird relationship.

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:08.120
 Then they threatened to sue him later on.

00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:12.920
 Then they made their own dress out of soup can labels.

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:15.680
 If you sent them $1 and two labels,

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:16.520
 they would send you a dress

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:17.920
 that looks like Campbell's soup can labels.

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:20.280
 - Oh, so it was for anyway, it wasn't like high fashion.

00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:21.120
 - No, no, no.

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:22.360
 It was just a sort of an offer.

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:23.440
 But it was based on-- - Oh, $1.

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:24.520
 That's a great value of dress.

00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:25.600
 - And two labels.

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:26.680
 (laughing)

00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:27.920
 It's still a great value of dress.

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:30.920
 But he just sort of dragged this perfectly innocent soup company

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:32.080
 into the world of high art.

00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:34.000
 And then they started engaging with it off the back of it.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:34.840
 It was very much. - You may ask,

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:35.680
 you might not know this,

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:37.240
 but if that was such a failure,

00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:40.080
 at what stage did he become not a failure?

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:41.000
 Do you know what I mean?

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.760
 - I think it was very soon after that.

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:44.640
 - I think it was almost the day after that.

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:45.640
 - I think it's connected, yeah.

00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:47.600
 - A lot of people thought all the soup thing don't know.

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:49.920
 And then a few critics said, actually, this is great.

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:50.760
 - Actually, it's pretty good, yeah.

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:53.000
 - Yeah, which I'm still on the fence about.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.440
 (laughing)

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:56.520
 Some other people who don't appreciate his art,

00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:59.160
 people from his original village.

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:00.000
 - Oh.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.920
 - 'Cause as you say,

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:03.280
 I think he was born in something like Pittsburgh.

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:06.680
 But ethnically, he was Russin.

00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:09.120
 Not Russian, Russin.

00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:12.400
 Which is this really tiny ethnicity

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:14.720
 from the Carpatho-Russian Mountains.

00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:17.160
 And it's between Poland, Slovakia and Ukraine.

00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:18.640
 And that's where both his parents were born

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:21.280
 before they emigrated to America.

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:23.520
 It actually, so he's from a place called Ruthenia,

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:27.000
 it's also called, which existed as a nation for one day

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.960
 in 1939. - What?

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:31.720
 - Yeah, it declared independence

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:34.040
 and then immediately was invaded by Hungary.

00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:35.160
 - Oh, that's bad luck.

00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:37.000
 (laughing)

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.520
 - Or was there a connection?

00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:40.800
 - There was a connection. - Oh, sorry.

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:41.960
 - It wasn't that they were thinking,

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:42.800
 when should we do it?

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:44.400
 Let's wait, no, we'll wait.

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:45.240
 Should we do it today?

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:46.080
 No, no, let's wait.

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:46.920
 Okay, finally.

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:48.320
 Let's declare our independence.

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:49.160
 Oh, fuck.

00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:52.360
 - Go on forward the chances.

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:54.200
 - There was stuff happening in 1939.

00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:55.040
 I'm not sure if you're aware of that.

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:55.880
 - I understand.

00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:58.360
 - But anyway, he's got all these cousins

00:40:58.360 --> 00:40:59.840
 still there in the area.

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:02.760
 And they kept in touch with Andy Wall's parents

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:03.880
 when they were in America.

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:06.600
 And the parents wrote back to their cousins in Slovakia

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:08.040
 saying he's a painter.

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:10.440
 And people were interviewed saying until the late 70s,

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:12.000
 they all thought he just painted houses.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.180
 They were like, oh, there's a house painter.

00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:17.920
 And then there was some good interviews.

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:19.240
 Like he's got a cousin.

00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:21.560
 I think a first cousin called Julia Vasholova,

00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:23.560
 who's from there, still lives there.

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:26.200
 And she said, semi-recently,

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:28.200
 in America, you don't really need to be good at something.

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:30.040
 You just need to be different.

00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:33.000
 Warhol was just really good at being different, wasn't he?

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.360
 - So he's called Warholah.

00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:36.280
 It was an A originally.

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:38.680
 But isn't it, I think it's in Slovakia

00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:40.560
 that they have the second largest collection

00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:42.960
 of Andy Warhol art now and memorabilia.

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:46.060
 So there's an actual museum there that's outside of Pittsburgh.

00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:46.900
 But how are you going to compete

00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:48.920
 with 600 boxes of mummified feet, right?

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:50.740
 Like you're not going to come first.

00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:53.320
 But yeah, so they've obviously embraced it now.

00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:54.160
 - Well, a little bit.

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:55.640
 The person who set up the museum embraced it,

00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:57.360
 but he did go around trying to tell everyone

00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:59.440
 to get into it, him and a lot of his family

00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:00.960
 and people there were like, we don't get it.

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:01.920
 We don't like it.

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:02.760
 - Right.

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:03.600
 - Whatever.

00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:04.920
 - And then he was shot.

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:05.760
 - And then he was shot.

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:10.160
 - By Valerie Solanas, who he put in a few movies.

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:13.560
 She thought she should have been in more of his movies.

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:15.960
 - He shot me and then I shot him.

00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:17.120
 - Yes, I guess so.

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:17.960
 - He took the task, isn't he?

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:20.600
 - I think she had a few issues.

00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:23.880
 But basically she was a member of a feminist organization

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:27.160
 called the Society for Cutting Up Men, or SCUM.

00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:29.880
 And she walked into his factory

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:32.120
 'cause the place where he worked was called the factory.

00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:34.800
 And she just walked in, shot him and walked out again.

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:36.240
 And then a few hours later,

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:38.560
 she kind of went to a policeman saying,

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:40.880
 I think the police are looking for me.

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:43.960
 I am a flower child, arrest me immediately.

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:44.800
 And they arrested her.

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:47.280
 - And he survived, just 'cause if you don't know his story,

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:48.680
 that sounds like he died, but yeah.

00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:49.520
 - Oh yeah.

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:51.920
 - It was 168, this all happened.

00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:53.960
 I thought that the reason she shot him

00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:57.040
 was because he had lost the script of a play

00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:01.920
 that she had written called Up Your Ass, which,

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:02.760
 and apparently--

00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:04.200
 - Or is that where he lost it?

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:05.800
 (laughing)

00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:07.520
 - But I mean, she went to jelly the way, yeah.

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:09.200
 - Yeah, probably for a few years.

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:10.640
 - Yeah, he was declared.

00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:11.480
 - She was declared.

00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:12.800
 - And to be honest, I don't know.

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:15.440
 But the episode of his shooting is insane.

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:16.520
 It's the kind of shooting you'd imagine

00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:18.520
 in Andy Warhol's mad life.

00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:20.760
 Two friends there, his friend Mario Amaya

00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:22.200
 was also shot on the bullet,

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:25.040
 went all the way through from back to front,

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:26.240
 didn't get any organs,

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:28.400
 but then they called an ambulance

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:30.600
 and it took half an hour to arrive.

00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:33.200
 And in that time, more mates turned up,

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:34.880
 found this blood-soaked scene.

00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:36.400
 Mario was running around going,

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:37.400
 "Is there a bullet in my back?

00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:38.680
 "Is there a bullet in my back?"

00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:41.240
 And then Andy Warhol's lying dead

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:43.400
 and he was literally declared dead.

00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:44.240
 - Really? - Yep.

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:46.240
 - In one of those youth here that was a fact

00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:47.640
 and you think, "No, surely not."

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:49.520
 But he was taken to hospital.

00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:50.920
 He had no signs of life

00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:52.640
 and there was a sort of vascular surgeon in the room

00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:55.280
 who said, "Hang on, I quite like the soup cans thing.

00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:56.880
 "I'm gonna really try and sew this guy up."

00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:58.960
 - Not true, the doctor didn't know who it was.

00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:00.280
 They thought he was a random tramp.

00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:01.720
 - Oh, I thought they thought he was a tramp at first

00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:02.800
 and then they were told he was Warhol

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:04.200
 when they were operating.

00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:05.040
 Although I'm not saying

00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:06.920
 he wouldn't have operated on the random tramp.

00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:09.000
 - No, Giuseppe Rossi was the name of the surgeon.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.640
 What a guy.

00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:12.080
 This is an artist, okay?

00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:12.920
 Boy, he did.

00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:15.560
 Serious.

00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:18.560
 Warhol's been shot, I think, twice and really badly.

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:19.960
 He's in very, very bad nick.

00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:20.800
 He's dead.

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:21.640
 - He's dead.

00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:25.000
 - But Rossi opens Andy Warhol's chest,

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.520
 massaged his heart, took out his spleen

00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:31.560
 and he puts it in order for 12 pints of blood.

00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:33.400
 And he's like, "We can do this."

00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:34.720
 - And he did it.

00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:35.560
 - Yeah.

00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:36.800
 - And Andy Warhol thanked him

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:39.440
 by giving him 10 posters of Campbell's soup.

00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:41.480
 - Well, thanks.

00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:43.440
 - Hang on, that's gonna be worth so much.

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:47.280
 - Yes, they were sold after Rossi eventually died.

00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:48.360
 I think his widow then sold it

00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:50.240
 'cause I imagine they kept them for life.

00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:51.080
 - Yeah.

00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:51.920
 - You know, yeah, yeah.

00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:54.520
 - If I gave a doctor 10 posters, that's an insult.

00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:55.360
 - What would you pick?

00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:56.180
 Posters of what?

00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:57.020
 Fish tour posters?

00:44:57.020 --> 00:44:57.860
 - Yeah, fish tour posters.

00:44:57.860 --> 00:44:59.000
 - This is Fanella's dream.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.400
 We've got to give away 10 of my posters.

00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:03.720
 - Brilliant, I've got them ready, Dad.

00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:06.000
 - Poor surgeons at home after a very hard day's work.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.840
 So I was like, there's a life-sized model

00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:09.480
 of Groucho Marx outside.

00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:11.720
 (laughing)

00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:19.760
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:21.080
 and that is James.

00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:22.280
 - Okay, my fact this week

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:25.480
 is that when Stansted Airport was being planned,

00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:29.440
 locals, complaining to maintain the area's natural beauty,

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:32.440
 often met in a village called Ugly.

00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:33.280
 - Lovely.

00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:34.560
 (laughing)

00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:37.120
 - So initially this was a fact that I found

00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:39.680
 about the Ugly Women's Institute.

00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:41.960
 We were gonna do an Ugly Women's Institute fact,

00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:45.240
 but that's kind of on the internet a fair bit.

00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:46.640
 And when I was researching that,

00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:49.640
 I found this campaign about Stansted

00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:53.000
 and they were deciding where to put London's third airport.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.560
 And it turns out that quite a few of the meetings

00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:58.040
 to stop the airport from going around there

00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:00.680
 took place in Ugly Church Hall.

00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:01.680
 (laughing)

00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:03.680
 Because Ugly is a village in Essex.

00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:06.800
 - Yeah, and we should say Stansted is an airport.

00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:08.320
 It's an airport for international listeners

00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:09.680
 who have not been.

00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:11.440
 - It is not a great place to spend time.

00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:12.440
 - It's not a beautiful place.

00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:13.480
 - It's one of the big three.

00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:15.000
 Gatwick Heathrow, Stansted.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.160
 - But yeah, they had lots of meetings

00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:17.840
 at this Ugly Church Hall.

00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:20.360
 Some of the Ugly residents were pro.

00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:24.760
 So the Ugly Youth Club (laughing)

00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:27.880
 wrote a letter to the Preservation Society

00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:30.720
 saying that it will bring some life into the area

00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:33.840
 that according to them had little around but farming.

00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:35.600
 And they said that a lot of young people

00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:36.960
 were moving out of the area.

00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:38.880
 And if you brought in this big airport

00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:40.160
 with all the jobs it created,

00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:43.360
 then maybe it will keep the Ugly Youth around.

00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:46.200
 And Councillor Jay Luckey's responded saying,

00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:48.120
 it's a feeling that the youth has

00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:51.200
 that they're being brought up among squares.

00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:52.680
 - Oh.

00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:54.280
 - So yeah, so it was, you know,

00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:56.280
 it wasn't everyone was against it,

00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:59.000
 but it is quite a beautiful part of the world actually.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:46:59.840
 - Is it?

00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:00.680
 - It is.

00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:01.520
 - Ugly is really nice.

00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:03.400
 I've been looking at photos.

00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:06.760
 - It's lovely, as they will tell you.

00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:08.640
 Understandably, they'll get defensive.

00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:09.480
 It's very beautiful.

00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:10.800
 Ugly Church is not ugly.

00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:12.440
 - Yeah, ugly green, ugly village hall.

00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:13.720
 There's an ugly farmer's market

00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:15.560
 that happens every now and then.

00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:16.840
 - I went on to company's house.

00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:18.360
 There's an ugly coach house.

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:21.880
 And until 2023, there was a company called the Ugly Indian

00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:23.680
 and it was based in Ugly.

00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:24.920
 And I can't find that what it was.

00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:25.960
 I assume it's a restaurant.

00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:26.800
 - Yeah.

00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:27.640
 - Right.

00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:29.960
 - It's not gonna be a single person, right?

00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:30.800
 - But there is.

00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:34.080
 - There's a group called the Ugly Indians in India

00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:36.480
 that kind of clean up potholes and stuff.

00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:37.320
 - Really?

00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:38.160
 - But it's not that.

00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:39.000
 - Oh, that's cool.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:40.360
 - No, that would be a terrible base

00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:42.080
 for much to clean up bottles and in here.

00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:44.260
 - I really liked the very first mention

00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:47.240
 that we have of ugly written down is in 1041.

00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:48.720
 And it had a different name.

00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:50.040
 It wasn't called ugly then.

00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:50.880
 - Oh yeah?

00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:52.640
 - It was called ugly.

00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:54.680
 (all laughing)

00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:56.000
 - Oh, you're spelling that?

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.840
 - U-G-E-L-E.

00:47:57.840 --> 00:47:58.680
 - Nice.

00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:00.520
 - Ugly.

00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:02.880
 And actually the locals there,

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:05.760
 the locals there don't call it ugly.

00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:07.680
 The posh ones who are living there,

00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:10.000
 they like to call it ugly.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:10.840
 - Stop it.

00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:11.680
 - No, they don't.

00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:13.560
 But there's not a single one.

00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:15.800
 - This was told to a reporter called Laura Fiddler

00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:17.500
 who was down there trying to find out

00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:19.600
 all the most interesting things about ugly.

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:22.520
 - Laura Fiddler's misunderstood the jokes on her.

00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:24.840
 It's five kilometers north of Stansted Airport.

00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:26.680
 So Stansted is named after a town called

00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:28.040
 Stansted Mount Fitchett,

00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:30.680
 which is just outside where the airport is.

00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:34.520
 So it's not inconceivable they could've called it ugly airport.

00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:35.960
 - That would've been terrific.

00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:38.360
 - Other nearby villages include Little London,

00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:41.840
 Mole Hill, Maggots End, and Hope End.

00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:44.000
 So Hope End Airport would've been a good one.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:44.960
 - That's good.

00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:46.640
 There is a nearby village called Nasty,

00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:48.040
 which is 12 miles away.

00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:48.880
 It's a long running.

00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:50.320
 I think it's just a joke.

00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:52.200
 Reputedly there was a newspaper headline once,

00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:54.160
 "Nasty man marries ugly woman."

00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:57.280
 - I suspect it never happened, sadly.

00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:58.520
 - The evidence isn't bad.

00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:01.740
 - Quite near to another little village called Matching Tye,

00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:02.580
 which is a great name.

00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:04.760
 - Oh, it's such a good name.

00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:05.880
 - It's T-Y-E.

00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:08.840
 Have you guys of Danor and the heard of Matching Tye?

00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:09.680
 - No.

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:10.520
 - No.

00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:11.560
 - I'm really surprised you haven't

00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:14.600
 because Rick Mail lived there until he was three years old.

00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:15.440
 - Oh!

00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:17.200
 - That is a real gap in our knowledge, Dan.

00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:19.440
 - Yeah, we're gonna have to send in our badge

00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:20.760
 and our gun back to Rick Mail.

00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:22.560
 So I think they shouldn't let us have a gun.

00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:24.680
 - I thought you had a badge and a big frying pan.

00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:27.280
 (all laughing)

00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:30.080
 - More Essex place names, just as we're on those.

00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:32.280
 There's Shallow Bowls.

00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:33.960
 Shallow, not Shallow, really.

00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:36.240
 Shallow Bowls, Wiggly Bush Lane,

00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:38.580
 Burnt Dick Hill, Dancing Dick's Lane,

00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:41.320
 and the best of all, Fingering Ho.

00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:42.160
 - Hopefully.

00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:43.000
 - Come on.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.520
 - Fingering Ho.

00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:45.340
 - Ho.

00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:46.840
 - Fingering Ho.

00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:48.440
 Yeah, you've said it three times now.

00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:50.880
 We've heard it, I think we understand why it's funny.

00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:53.000
 (all laughing)

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:53.840
 - That's great.

00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:57.120
 - Speaking of Dicks, Dicks related names,

00:49:57.120 --> 00:49:59.520
 there is an Ugly Women's Institute,

00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:02.680
 and there was, well, it was certainly reported

00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:04.800
 in the late '50s that they decided to change

00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:06.800
 to Women's Institute brackets, ugly,

00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:07.800
 but then by the '80s,

00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:09.940
 they were back to being the Ugly Women's Institute,

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:13.680
 and their president in the late '70s was Mrs. Dicks.

00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:16.680
 Mrs. Dicks was president of the Ugly Women's Institute.

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:17.520
 Yes.

00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:20.480
 - You know the most famous person to visit ugly ever, I think.

00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:22.040
 - Oh, just like passing visit.

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:22.880
 - Yeah.

00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:23.720
 - Daphne and Celeste.

00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:25.040
 - No.

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:27.680
 - Think more German.

00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:28.520
 - German.

00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:29.880
 - Daphne and Celeste.

00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:32.440
 (all laughing)

00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:35.800
 - Tomorrow German, well, Ahets, Adolf Hitler.

00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:36.640
 - You know what?

00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:39.160
 Right period, right cabinet, in fact.

00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:40.000
 - Gering.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:40.840
 - Okay.

00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:41.680
 - Hitler.

00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:42.520
 - It's another.

00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:44.360
 - Can we just pause on the fact that James has a nickname

00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:45.200
 for Hitler?

00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:47.040
 (all laughing)

00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:49.040
 - We go way back.

00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:49.880
 - Ahets.

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:51.560
 - We're just reading it off his tattoo there.

00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:54.060
 (all laughing)

00:50:54.060 --> 00:50:56.800
 - I couldn't fit the full name on my penis.

00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:59.380
 (all laughing)

00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:03.200
 - Oh my God.

00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:05.760
 - Wow.

00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:07.080
 - Oh, dear.

00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:09.000
 - It was Joachim von Ribbentrop.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:09.840
 - Oh, is it?

00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:10.660
 - Yeah.

00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:11.840
 - Try fitting that on your penis.

00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:13.640
 (all laughing)

00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:15.680
 - Of Pactfame.

00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:17.000
 - Of Pactfame.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.240
 - The moment when Ribbentrop was Russian and German.

00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:21.600
 He was the foreign minister.

00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:25.160
 I think this was before his time as German foreign minister.

00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:28.920
 He visited Orford House, which is just outside, I think,

00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:31.520
 but it's still in the sort of parish boundaries.

00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:33.320
 And of course, later he was the first man

00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:35.440
 hanged for war crimes after the Nuremberg trials.

00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:36.280
 - He was, yeah.

00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:37.600
 I think he might have been the only person

00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:38.800
 who's been too ugly, who was hanged

00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:40.720
 as part of the Nuremberg trials.

00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:41.800
 - And what was he?

00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:42.640
 - I believe.

00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:43.520
 - And what was that?

00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:45.320
 Like why was he staying at a hotel

00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:46.920
 the night before a flight from Stanstead?

00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:48.560
 (all laughing)

00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:50.560
 - It was a beautiful house that I think was owned

00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:53.120
 by a local toff who invited him over probably.

00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:54.400
 - And he loved England.

00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:55.920
 I think it was Ribbentrop who kept on trying

00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:57.040
 to get him to invade England

00:51:57.040 --> 00:51:58.560
 'cause he thought all of it was so beautiful.

00:51:58.560 --> 00:51:59.880
 Loved Cornwall.

00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:00.720
 - Yeah.

00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:01.560
 - Right.

00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:02.800
 - Yeah, probably loved ugly.

00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:06.440
 - So there was a big argument about Stanstead Airport

00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:07.280
 when it came in.

00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:09.520
 So we had two airports in London.

00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:11.520
 We had Gatwick and Heathrow,

00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:13.320
 and they thought we're definitely gonna have

00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:14.840
 to build a third one.

00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:17.360
 And the decision that we were gonna need

00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:19.920
 was starting about the '50s and '60s,

00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:21.680
 and they didn't actually build Stanstead Airport

00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:22.760
 until the '80s.

00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:25.720
 I think it finished in '85, something like that.

00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:29.600
 Because actually, Stanstead in the end was,

00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:31.920
 they just did up an old airfield.

00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:33.720
 Like rather than building like

00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:35.960
 a whole big massive new airport,

00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:37.680
 like is what they were planning,

00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:40.360
 they kind of rolled back on that idea a little bit

00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:41.720
 and went for the smaller version,

00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:43.280
 which was what Stanstead was.

00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:45.680
 But everyone obviously got really upset about it.

00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:47.360
 - People don't like airports near them, do they?

00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:48.200
 I understand, please.

00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:50.640
 - And it wasn't even, like during the war,

00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:51.480
 during the Second World War,

00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:54.240
 it was the ninth largest American air base in East Anglia.

00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:56.400
 Like it might not have been the obvious choice, actually.

00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:57.240
 They were bigger ones.

00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:58.680
 After the war, it was used as a base

00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:00.040
 for German prisoners of war

00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:02.480
 who were gonna be sent back to Germany.

00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:03.320
 And actually--

00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:04.160
 - That's a good idea, isn't it?

00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:05.080
 - Well, if you get a Stanstead now,

00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:07.000
 they've really preserved that sense

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.440
 of what it must have been like.

00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:10.280
 Yeah.

00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:13.800
 - And they nearly built the third airport

00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:17.280
 in a place called Wing in Buckinghamshire.

00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:21.520
 Yeah, there was locals there weren't happy about it,

00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:25.160
 either informed the Wing Airport Resistance Association.

00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:26.960
 But that was gonna be a really big airport.

00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:29.600
 And it was after the oil crisis in the '70s,

00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:31.520
 they decided that actually we should do a smaller one

00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:33.200
 and that's when they went to Stanstead.

00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:35.560
 So we could have had a Wing airport.

00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:37.560
 And actually where the airport was gonna be,

00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:39.600
 there's now, they put some trees there

00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:42.680
 and you can go and visit that sort of patch of forest

00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:44.320
 of where there should have been an airport.

00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:47.000
 - Is that a big tourist hotspot in Buckinghamshire?

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:50.360
 - Just nimbyism in general.

00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:51.200
 - Oh yeah.

00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:52.560
 - You know, there's a nimby not in my backyard.

00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:55.080
 This is what people say when they don't want to think.

00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:59.320
 The alternatives are the banana people

00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:02.560
 and that is built absolutely nothing anywhere near anything.

00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:03.400
 (laughing)

00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:04.220
 It's good.

00:54:04.220 --> 00:54:05.060
 - That's brilliant.

00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:05.900
 - And there's an idea in,

00:54:05.900 --> 00:54:07.560
 I think it's more of an American thing when it's cave,

00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:10.160
 which is citizens against virtually everything,

00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:11.560
 which is another good idea.

00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:12.920
 - Nice, that's really good.

00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:14.480
 - But maybe the paradigm example of this,

00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:16.960
 this was something that happened in Medway in Kent.

00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:20.240
 So not far from Essex, three years ago.

00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:22.360
 Medway Council, they really wanted to add solar panels

00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:24.120
 to their headquarters.

00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:26.720
 It's kind of a post-war, like modern initial block.

00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:29.080
 It's not sort of, it's not incredibly exciting to look at.

00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:31.000
 They thought let's stick some solar panels on there.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.080
 So the Medway Council put in an application

00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:35.520
 to Medway Council to put solar panels

00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:37.520
 on their own headquarters and they were shocked

00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:39.960
 that Medway Council turned down the request

00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:43.760
 by Medway Council saying, no, this is not appropriate at all.

00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:46.560
 The weird thing is it already had solar panels on it.

00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:48.680
 They were just like, can we put some more on there?

00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:51.260
 (upbeat music)

00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:55.000
 - Okay, that is it.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.000
 That is all of our facts.

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.400
