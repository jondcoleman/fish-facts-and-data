00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,820
 Hey everyone welcome to this week's episode of fish before we begin

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:09,920
 We just want to let you know we have a very special guest on it is the QI main man himself James Harkin

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,360
 Who is it? It's James Harkin the QI main man himself

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,980
 That's right. And the second banana has joined us this week as well

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:23,540
 No, it is his name is his name is Alan Davis and he is the main big banana

6
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:27,340
 He is the biggest banana of all the bunch of people who work at QI

7
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:33,620
 He's our absolute best mate and he's come along to tell us a load of facts that we didn't already know

8
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:39,860
 That's right. Yeah, and we also want to just quickly mention that he has a new book out. It's an extraordinary book

9
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:46,820
 It's called just ignore him and it is a memoir of which Stephen Fry former co-host on QI second banana

10
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,320
 second banana to Alan

11
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:56,540
 Said it's funny sad frightening sweet savage and tender just ignore him will never leave you and that's what all the critics are

12
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:00,980
 Saying about it as well. It has had universal praise and we highly highly recommend it

13
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:05,300
 Yeah, it's an absolutely brilliant book. It's just I mean you probably know Alan

14
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:12,580
 There's just this funny happy-go-lucky guy, but it really really gets down to what made him who he is and I can't recommend it

15
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:17,420
 Enough. It's just such a great great book. It's available presumably in all good book shops

16
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:22,260
 I guess even the shit ones even the shit one so definitely go out and get that but in the meantime

17
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:27,860
 You can hear him doing what he does best which is being unbelievably funny and this week show

18
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:32,240
 Okay on with the podcast on with the show top banana

19
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:52,940
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast coming to you

20
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:57,300
 From four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Shriver

21
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:01,780
 I am sitting here with James Harkin Anna Tashinsky and special guest

22
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,820
 It's Alan Davis and once again

23
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:10,020
 We have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here

24
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,020
 We go starting with you

25
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,900
 Alan

26
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:21,460
 Well, I've found for you from the Lizmore library in Australia an unusual approach you can borrow a

27
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,140
 person

28
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,580
 The human library it's called

29
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:34,320
 And the human library was started to create a space and this is the from the founder Ronnie Abergel

30
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,700
 You could walk in borrow a human being and talk to them about a very challenging topic

31
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,900
 Ideally, we wanted people to talk about issues

32
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:49,780
 They would normally would not talk about or don't like to talk about and so you get you get a human book and that's a volunteer

33
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,140
 From a diverse background where they have experiences

34
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:59,860
 They're willing to share and they have titles the human books have titles like black activists or chronic depression or

35
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,420
 survivor of trafficking

36
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:13,360
 Really really bad Edinburgh experience

37
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,420
 Shotlifter

38
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:33,020
 That's such a good point about Edinburgh though imagine getting that in your review. Have you thought of being a human book instead?

39
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:40,940
 There is a photo here and it's just you just sit at a table for someone you sit at a table with a human book

40
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:44,380
 And then and you borrow them from her for an amount of time

41
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:50,180
 Hmm. I mean, I don't know. It's been that Monty Python sketch, you know, when you get an argument

42
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:57,700
 So it goes in and says I've come here for an argument they go. No, you haven't

43
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:05,100
 But I think it must be really like imagine if you're one of these books and like you're there for a few days

44
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:09,780
 And no one takes you out that must be pretty depressing. Yeah, that's yeah bad stick

45
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,200
 They have a thing where so they all sit in a sort of waiting room

46
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,120
 which they call the bookshelf and

47
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:21,580
 They have a matchmaker so someone says I want to get a human book out and the librarian match makes you with a type of book

48
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:26,100
 I give they give you the list, but but here's an interesting thing while they're waiting to be chosen

49
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,160
 It can obviously get a bit boring there so they can borrow each other out while they're waiting

50
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,660
 It's like

51
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:37,940
 Sorry, I didn't realize

52
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,360
 Before

53
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:49,520
 Do they have barcodes on them? I mean if you try to smuggle out a book under your jacket

54
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,020
 I found it under the bed. It's been there for two years. Oh

55
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,340
 It's not just this Lismore library in Australia

56
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:15,140
 So this was launched back in 2000 in Copenhagen by who Alan mentioned earlier Ronnie and a few others

57
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:22,420
 And it sort of went around to festivals and they had people where you could rent them out at Ross Kilda festival and so on and then it's

58
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,280
 Sort of the idea latched on and it's spread out

59
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:29,800
 So it's an over 70 countries now that you can go to certain libraries and they don't always have them waiting in the back room

60
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,380
 They're not just permanently sitting there

61
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:35,720
 It's sort of like on a Friday between the hours of nine and three or something like that

62
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,780
 We have slots since COVID. They they have started doing it virtually

63
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:44,740
 So you can you can borrow one, you know

64
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:51,660
 It's all about diversity and you know understanding people from other backgrounds or races or cultures. It's very good

65
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,320
 Yeah, it's a good plan. It's it's challenging your

66
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,140
 preconceptions, I guess isn't it?

67
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:01,220
 Making you people making some friends, you know, if you're really lonely. Well, that's it

68
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:06,880
 I mean, we're now recording recording this in the second lockdown and everyone's sick to the back teeth of all the people

69
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,880
 They normally zoom

70
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,880
 With the quiz markets falling off and cliff

71
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,200
 I know it's like you get sick of the people you live with and then sick of the people you zoom

72
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,440
 Yeah, and then I'm sick of my Amazon delivery guy now

73
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:25,440
 Well, it's time to go to the human library

74
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,700
 Libraries are really trying to branch out in the modern day, right, you know, because people often don't use them anymore

75
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:37,660
 So they say they're trying to get to grips with the digital age and now they just hire out loads of random stuff

76
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:42,740
 so there's this woman Barbara stripling who's the president of the American Library Association and

77
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:50,140
 She says that local libraries are constantly getting calls from people like plumbers or electronic specialists saying

78
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:53,180
 Do you want to put me in your books catalogue and you can rent me out?

79
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:59,280
 You can hire me out to people who you know need a plumber or need to learn about how to wire a plug and

80
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,180
 So actually you can hire people for practical purposes as well

81
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,680
 I think it'd be a weird thing to do to go to your library as a first port of cool if your toilets blocks, but

82
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,960
 It's worth a try currently

83
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:17,320
 I really I have a lot of faith in YouTube for all of those things. Yeah. Yes. Yeah, I had to sew up

84
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:23,440
 My five-year-olds one of his poor patrol toys that have split down its back

85
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,120
 It was Marshall for those of you interested in the best

86
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:33,760
 Great guy. I love him. That's the prone. That's why he's funny. Yeah, and

87
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,700
 Ironically, it's he's the one who got split down his back

88
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,780
 Typical Marshall

89
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:47,020
 And I got a needle and thread for the first time since I don't know when this century and start and then thought how do you finish?

90
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,780
 Oh, I must have been taught this at primary school

91
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:54,360
 I'm sure but I don't remember and I found a YouTube video that told me how to sew

92
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,120
 Wow, and how do you finish you do like a little knot at the end or something?

93
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,960
 You don't put it all the way through you leave a loop and go in that

94
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,880
 And they do another one of those and then you're done. I've left

95
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,920
 Proudly left Marshall on the table

96
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,860
 Well, we started talking about Paw Patrol that was so much in his comfort zone

97
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:22,060
 I've ever seen him on this podcast. He was like

98
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:31,100
 Just on Anna you were just talking about things that you could take out from libraries

99
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,360
 Yeah, curious things so outside of people you can also get really

100
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:40,700
 Sort of practical things for your house like light the Philadelphia library allows you to get cake pans for if you're baking

101
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:45,000
 That's pot so you can get a book and a cake pan. Yeah, you can at the Ann Arbor Library of Michigan as well

102
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,700
 You can rent out lots of weird tools and it says we only stocked the unusual tools that you might not have in your own house

103
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:57,160
 Which is a kind of a good idea, right? Because with a cake pan, you know, I'm only gonna make one cake every three years or whatever

104
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:04,340
 So I don't want to buy a whole pan for it much better to just hire it out in my time. I've lived with several unusual tools

105
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:08,920
 They know who they are

106
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,320
 Um guys, this is on books and

107
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,300
 Fagely this fact and we just never mentioned on the show

108
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:21,820
 And I think we should talk about the fact that Boris Johnson wrote a novel in 2004. Has any of you read it?

109
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,820
 No, I've seen it

110
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:29,180
 It's called something virgins very very well done. It's a certain number of virgins

111
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:39,280
 It's littered with racial stereotypes, isn't that right? I think I read about it in the Guardian

112
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,600
 The racial stereotype detectives column

113
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,180
 Well, you won't be surprised to know the telegraph called it effortlessly brilliant

114
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:56,080
 This is genius, this is exactly what I think

115
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,120
 Therefore it must be excellent

116
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,740
 It does sound I mean it's extraordinary first of all

117
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:11,340
 It's about a sort of bumbling gaffe prone bike riding MP who's vaguely in trouble for a sexual indiscretion and

118
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:14,100
 It's a Marina Hyde read it

119
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:19,420
 So we don't have to and tweeted a few of the quotes from it one quote is Boris Johnson wrote these words

120
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:22,700
 She was looking this may sound crude

121
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:28,380
 But it is no less than the truth like a lingerie model only cleverer and if anything with bigger breasts

122
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:36,480
 Just write those words in a book although it is meant to be a farce so to be fair. Well, that's what his premiership is turning out to

123
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:45,280
 I read about that. I read an article that suggests that people who are storytellers like Boris Johnson as you say

124
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,680
 Have more children than non storytellers

125
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,960
 This was a couple of

126
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:59,440
 anthropologists who are looking at the Agta people who live in the Philippines and they're a hunter-gatherer group and they don't really

127
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,580
 Then one of these groups that aren't really affected by the Western world very much

128
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:10,920
 And they looked at the people who tell the stories in the group and they found that they are more desirable social partners

129
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,880
 They ask people of all these ones this guy does lots of

130
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:18,640
 Finding food and this guy tells lots of stories and this guy does a lot of fixing things

131
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,360
 Who would you most like to have sex with most of the people said they wanted to have sex with the storytellers?

132
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,080
 Really? Yeah, is that because they don't have poor patrol to put on for five hours there

133
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,660
 So they know when they have kids they need someone who's going to sit up doing the bedtime story thing

134
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:37,040
 They didn't they didn't come up with any idea why it might be the case. They just said it was the case

135
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:44,980
 Interesting. Well, it does figure doesn't it? Good old Boris. Maybe the only way to shut the storyteller up is to have sex with them

136
00:11:54,900 --> 00:12:02,280
 I was reading about in terms of old storytelling traditions in China. They have pingshu which is a

137
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,600
 version of the

138
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:10,840
 Any sort of group that has that one person who knows all of the stories and all the traditions of the people and what led them to

139
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,700
 This current point that's their version of it and for a very long time

140
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,600
 these people were so revered that radio channels would just play them and

141
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:24,820
 Farmers would have the radio out there listening to these long stories and those classic Chinese stories that date back

142
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:32,500
 From ages and ages ago that they're simply telling over and over but as far as I can tell pingshu is a bit different to other storytellers in that

143
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,580
 While they're telling the story

144
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:38,840
 They break off to give commentary about it and the commentary is their own personal opinion

145
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:43,780
 Which they could go on for 20 minutes or so and it's a tradition that is kind of still going on

146
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:48,340
 So the old stories aren't engaging the kids anymore. So they have to use news stories

147
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,980
 So there's a guy who's been going since 2012

148
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:56,660
 Telling in pingshu the entire harry potter book series and he's going to finish it

149
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:02,580
 Some he's on the order of the phoenix right now in 2020. So that's book five

150
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:06,300
 I believe and so these little diversions in in the second book

151
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,100
 You've got the three-headed dog in chamber of secrets

152
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:15,580
 He'll then go into greek mythology for 20 minutes to talk about the three-headed dog away from the so it's the worst to me

153
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:20,700
 Kind of storytelling. Yeah, you want to hear the story and then your son again 20 minutes about the greek info

154
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:25,260
 You know, yeah, it's like someone leaning over your shoulder when you're reading going. I love this bit of this bit

155
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,300
 Oh, this guy's awful, isn't he? You don't you don't want that. I think it sounds

156
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:33,100
 Does it not sound more like footnotes or something? That's true. Actually, that's true

157
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,220
 How quickly I've buckled I'm really into it

158
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:39,180
 Sounds awesome

159
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,340
 James do all your favorite works of fiction have footnotes

160
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:45,020
 Well, I think the problem is that I don't really read fiction very much

161
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:50,060
 I read a lot of nonfiction and what dan's describing sounds more like a nonfiction thing, doesn't it?

162
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:54,300
 It sounds more like okay. Now we're going to tell you some facts about Kerberus or whatever

163
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:59,980
 And to me that's I guess I just need to read more fiction. Well, sometimes you can get

164
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:07,100
 Like if you're reading a dickens book, for example, yeah, these books are so full of references in the day

165
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:13,660
 They're written in many, you know, published as they were a magazine form is full of jokes about characters of the time

166
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:17,740
 And so the footnotes in those books or they usually notes at the back of the volume

167
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:23,260
 Pages and pages in here he refers to and here this is about and this is a popular song of the time

168
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,660
 And this is the right of the time and this is someone think it's hated

169
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,180
 Yeah, that's what you can you can go to those or

170
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:35,580
 Or not. Yeah, I love the footnote. Actually, it's kind of the best bit sometimes, you know, full. It's full of weird

171
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,180
 facts

172
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:41,020
 I think um, James, I think you found something recently about how if

173
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:45,660
 Um, people didn't have somewhere to sleep for the night, but they couldn't afford a bed in a homeless house

174
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:51,740
 Yeah, you could sit up on seats. Can I just say we shouldn't be saying this to Alan because it will be on qi next year

175
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:57,180
 If it wasn't for the fact that I 100 know that he will have forgotten it by the time it goes out

176
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,820
 We shouldn't be saying it, but um, yeah

177
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,820
 Sorry, what did you say?

178
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:06,060
 So in victorian times if you didn't have anywhere to live but you're working in the city

179
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,500
 But you needed somewhere to sleep

180
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,460
 You could pay one pence and you would be able to sit on a bench for the night

181
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:14,700
 Or you could pay two pence and you'd be able to hang over the top of a rope, right?

182
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:20,620
 The rope would go underneath your armpits and then you would kind of sleep there and that is it dickens, isn't it? Is it?

183
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:27,420
 It's it's I remember I read about that in a footnote in one of the dickens. Yeah. Yeah one of the dickens is

184
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:31,980
 So they're good. They're maybe good fiction for you to start with james full of footnotes or david foster wallis

185
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,460
 If you want more footnotes than actual fiction

186
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:42,140
 Okay, any footnotes in the borris johnson, but um a lot of very arcane references that yeah, you need tons of footnotes for those

187
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,980
 It did sell more than the last book we wrote. Just want to make that clear

188
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:57,820
 You can get eddie is arts written in autobiography, uh, which is a great find especially like eddie, but

189
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:02,700
 He's got lots of footnotes in it, but so in the audio book that I listen to he reads the footnotes

190
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:09,500
 But of course eddies always digresses in his in his comedy. It's big part of what it does is digression digression digression

191
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:15,020
 But instead of just digressing he reads it as a book so you'll talk for a bit and then you'll go footnote

192
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,100
 And then he'll tell you something and then he'll say

193
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:22,060
 End of footnote and then he will carry on talking and then you go footnote

194
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:27,500
 After a while, you're going stop saying footnote. Just read it out

195
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:35,900
 Single greatest digress so it needs to be English language and now you're going foot end of footnote

196
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,500
 I love it. I love eddie dearly, but I could not listen to that

197
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:46,700
 Yeah edit those out. Maybe he'll hear this and go back and edit the foot. Straight back to hillary mantel

198
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:53,980
 Chapter 907 oh god don't get me started

199
00:16:53,980 --> 00:17:04,060
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is anna

200
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:09,100
 My fact this week is that it's illegal in the uk to tickle a trout

201
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:15,580
 Trout tickling. Yeah, they don't like it. No, they do like it. That's the problem

202
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:18,060
 So I guess anyone have you guys ever

203
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:23,500
 Have you guys heard of trout tickling? Are you familiar with the concept? Have you ever tickled trout yourselves? Yeah, we have it in the north

204
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,580
 Can I just check that trout's not a euphemism here?

205
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:32,540
 I don't want to be kind of uncool and know that you're all talking about the penis

206
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,300
 It's great point

207
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:40,780
 If it is a euphemism, then I've misunderstood all of the articles I've read about

208
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:48,860
 It's an angling thing that goes back many hundreds of years and p fishman will talk about it

209
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:52,540
 And it's what you do is you dip your hand if you're trying to catch a trout without a rod

210
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:58,380
 Then you dip your hands in the water. I was actually speaking to someone. I know who says he's done it yesterday

211
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:02,140
 Dip your hands in the water and you sort of want to chase a trout under a rock

212
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,740
 They'll hide from you under a rock

213
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:08,540
 Then you go underneath the trout and you pull your hands up gradually until you're touching it

214
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:12,940
 And then you want to touch it at the tail end and then just sort of tickle its little belly

215
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:17,660
 Creeping your fingers up in a weird and pervy way until you've tickled it right up to the head

216
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:22,620
 And it makes them go completely motionless. They seem to love it or it at least makes them catatonic

217
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:27,180
 I heard of it. They go into a sort of a trance. Exactly. But that's illegal

218
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,980
 It's illegal because

219
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:34,860
 It's illegal because it's um, well, so there's a lot of angry people online who say it's a hangover from

220
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:39,500
 Classism of the olden days essentially because it's thought of as poaching because

221
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:45,180
 You if you don't have a rod then you can easily pretend that you weren't trying to poach fish from a river

222
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:49,660
 So it's a way of getting away with stealing fish from someone's river without permission

223
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:53,180
 And so it's illegal. You've got a fish with a rod in line or a net

224
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:58,700
 You're allowed to do it if you're if you're on your own property and you have your own river going through your own property

225
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:02,700
 Um, I think you are allowed to do it, right? It's only in public

226
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:11,100
 Lones, right? I can't remember years ago. I was on holiday with bill Bailey and in uh, indonesia and we were on this river

227
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,780
 Doing some sort of canoeing or rafting or something anyway

228
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:22,780
 It was idyllic mountains and trees and tropical foliage everywhere and floating down the river and I thought this is perfect

229
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:27,580
 Oh, what a paradise. I understand my bill comes here all the time. It's just really takes you away from everything

230
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:31,260
 He's always saying never got asthma while he was there. There's no pollution, etc.

231
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:31,900
 etc

232
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,620
 Then we go around the bend in the river and there's a local gentleman

233
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:38,540
 With a car battery slung over his shoulder

234
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,260
 connected to a metal pole

235
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,820
 wading in the river

236
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,820
 electrocute in fish

237
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,300
 Oh my god

238
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:54,540
 So it was suddenly completely removed from the ecstasy of communing with with nature

239
00:19:55,660 --> 00:20:01,340
 The brutal reality it's kind of the only time we've ever seen has seen a car battery used like that

240
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,980
 Was in a film about the craze when they were torturing someone

241
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:07,900
 I mean, it's it's very resourceful

242
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:11,740
 You're going to get more fish that way really really effective. Yeah

243
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,580
 Oh, wow

244
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:18,940
 I think they they do try to uh people who actually are permissioned to try to kill trout like that in fact

245
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,100
 so I think they're invasive trout in

246
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,860
 Yellowstone lake

247
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:29,260
 Which are eating up all the trout that's supposed to be there and they've tried to electrify the whole lake by

248
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:34,700
 So electrocuting all the eggs, but the water didn't conduct it well enough apparently weird because water's a good conductor

249
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,500
 So you've got to make sure you got the voltage for it. Yeah

250
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:44,380
 And actually what they did and this is really creepy is they so this is Yellowstone lake and the native trout are the cutthroat trout

251
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:47,500
 Which is confusing because they're the good guys who are meant to be there

252
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,260
 And the invasive trout have come in they're eating them all up

253
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:55,260
 And so the way eventually researchers have managed to get rid of the invasive trout

254
00:20:55,260 --> 00:21:02,060
 One of the ways is they suffocate the invasive ones by dumping loads of dead fish in the water

255
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:07,180
 And then that removes the oxygen from get stops the oxygen from getting in and the eggs don't survive

256
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:12,700
 So you see them like tipping all these fish back into the water suffocated by their own parents

257
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:18,780
 But it's it's all in honor of saving the cutthroat trout. So it's actually sort of a good thing depending on which side of that fence you're falling on

258
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,500
 Sound of the cutthroat trout. Yeah

259
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:26,940
 How do they survive all the lack of oxygen though? Or is it they hang out in slightly different parts of the lake?

260
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:33,260
 And so you just got to pick your spot. Got it. Right. Um chart tickling is mentioned in Shakespeare, isn't it?

261
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,340
 I reckon if you looked in the um

262
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,420
 In the footnotes it would be there

263
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:41,980
 It's in twelfth night when malvolio walks in and malvolio's a bit stupid

264
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:46,140
 Maria says here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling

265
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:51,420
 Don't know if that that might be one of um Shakespeare's weird sexy jokes that no one gets

266
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:56,940
 But I don't know. Yeah. Oh, could you imagine the riotous laughter at the globe?

267
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:05,820
 I actually I saw Stephen Fry being now malvolio and it was genuinely riotous laughter

268
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:10,140
 He's quite a talented man. So that's Stephen Fry. Yeah, I don't remember that specific line

269
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:13,740
 this um, I was I was reading as well about these methods of

270
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,140
 unconventional fishing so

271
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:21,340
 Electrifying and using chorobatteries in the water to get fish and one of the ways that a lot of people do

272
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:25,900
 It is using dynamite. So dynamite fishing you pop a bunch of dynamite in

273
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:29,100
 Blows up all the fish raised to the surface and you collect them

274
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:34,140
 And that's a big problem for a lot of places where there's coral reefs because they're absolutely

275
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:38,380
 Decimating all of these coral reefs and then the Philippines. It's a big problem in particular

276
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:43,660
 So in 2010 a group called the sea knights decided to do something about it

277
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:49,820
 Philippines is very very religious and so what they did was where the coral reef was they dumped at the bottom of the ocean

278
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:55,980
 A 14 foot tall statue of the virgin Mary so that if anyone came by they would see the virgin Mary in the ocean

279
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,140
 and want to pray to her as opposed to

280
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:03,020
 Decimate her with dynamite. So yeah, yeah, so they've gone back

281
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:07,740
 In 2018 eight years later and it seems to have worked. She's covered in coral

282
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:11,740
 It's growing on her now and all the coral in the area seems to be vibrant again

283
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:15,580
 Because no one's blowing it up and it's bringing a lot of tourists in so if you want to stop

284
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:20,140
 Yeah, any illegal poaching just pop a virgin Mary into your area and you should be fine

285
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:25,900
 Popping a virgin Mary into your area again does sound like a euphemism, but that is ingenious

286
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:29,500
 It's better than popping a virgin Mary out of your area

287
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:33,020
 Or is it?

288
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:37,980
 In scotland it looks it looks like it's known as guddling

289
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,580
 It is that's what my friend called it yesterday. He does it in the highlands

290
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:49,660
 Guddling guddler trout in scotland. It's like talking about guddling. It's a bit like cuddling, isn't it tickling and guddling and

291
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:53,340
 Touch it into a trance. It's a wonderful skill. Yeah

292
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:58,460
 I read one person who does it who says you need to be very gentle and with a delicate touch

293
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,860
 Much as though you are caressing your lover

294
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:04,540
 Wow, you then of course fry on the barbecue

295
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:08,300
 After you've gutted them

296
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:12,300
 [Laughter]

297
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:19,500
 Technically gobbling if you ever want to know the term specifically for trout if you're gutting a trout or chopping up a trout

298
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,340
 It's called gobbling according to a book of carving from 1508

299
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:29,660
 So I don't know if it's in common use anymore. A few watch that program. It's on bbc2. I think about it's called scotland from the sky

300
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:33,020
 No, yeah, I think I have seen it. It's really good

301
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:38,380
 And it's a kind of history history of scotland from the sky so aerial photography

302
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:42,060
 But in getting to the sky and use there's all kinds of

303
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:45,260
 lost history that's rediscovered and

304
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,500
 and one of the

305
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:51,020
 Things they were talking about in the last I'll watch it with my daughter. She loves it

306
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:57,980
 And the last one was the lost herring industry scotland used to have this huge herring industry

307
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:03,900
 And they used to export herring by the hundreds of tons to particularly to russia and

308
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:08,140
 Germany and those markets disappeared with the second world war

309
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:12,860
 But they would have herring girls and herring girls could gut herring

310
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:18,780
 They had footage black and white footage of herring girls with buckets full of herring gutting them at a terrific rate

311
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:21,260
 Cutting up 40 fish in a minute

312
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:26,220
 It's absolutely extraordinary kind of lost art and lost industry

313
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:32,860
 I wonder why it was the girls who did it just didn't the boys were on the boats and the girls were doing the gutting and that's how

314
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,220
 That's how it worked

315
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:37,820
 I remember reading about those herring girls and they used to you know

316
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:41,660
 They were really cliquey and they would like do all the gutting in the daytime

317
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:45,900
 And then they'd all go to the bars in the evening and they would never go home in between

318
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:49,500
 So they'd go to the bars and they'd be covered in herring guts and you know

319
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:55,900
 Really messy business the spell must be unbelievable

320
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:59,340
 That's a human library book. You wouldn't want

321
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:10,060
 Yeah, it's gotten from the sky it's worth a watch

322
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:17,180
 There's another thing in there about creating this so they kind of can't create fish traps by building a kind of l shape

323
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,340
 out of rock

324
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:25,180
 Into a tidal river and as tide goes out fish get caught up here in the owl and then

325
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:30,220
 The catch it was incredibly efficient way of catching fish so much so that

326
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:34,700
 They had too many and then they ended up dead fish were poisoning the locks

327
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:38,460
 It became it was made illegal sometime in the 19th century, but it was yeah

328
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,580
 Yeah genius ways of trapping fish

329
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:44,540
 The scots are all over it

330
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:48,460
 Feels like cheating to me

331
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:54,380
 Yeah, um, you know we had a conversation a few weeks ago about how did all the fish get in the lakes?

332
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:59,020
 Oh, yeah, and this weird mystery and I don't any guesses

333
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,740
 You know when you got late

334
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:04,220
 Stick with basic evolution

335
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:08,940
 Helpless other than that basic evolution. Yeah, you're basically running the mill

336
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,100
 evolution

337
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,100
 Okay, I'm standing me but something like that

338
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:19,260
 They just used to be a me but okay, thanks for that answer cut to 10 million years

339
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:23,500
 Um, even Darwin doesn't agree with you there. So Darwin thought that

340
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:28,940
 The way that the fish had got into the lakes was the eggs that little fish eggs that attach to bird feathers

341
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:32,940
 And then in the sea and then birds had flown and sort of dropped them over lakes

342
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:37,820
 Which is generally how people thought these fish got in lakes, but there's actually no

343
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:40,540
 Christians Christians just laugh at it, you know

344
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:46,620
 Yeah, whatever the eggs were on the wings of the birds, that's right

345
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:50,620
 I mean it sounds ridiculous

346
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:56,220
 They've got a point but the thing is Alan who made the amoeba

347
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:59,980
 You know, we can all say that it went from amoeba to fish in the lake

348
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:03,500
 But you know, you need the perfect conditions to create life

349
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:09,260
 Liquid and you've got to be in the gold eloxone James. Okay, got it. It's not it's not Lancashire

350
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:17,980
 Wow life on earth did not start in Lancashire. I know you credit a lot of things with lancas. That's why life on earth did not begin there

351
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:20,380
 But that is where it reached its absolute peak

352
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,980
 In the Harkin household

353
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:27,980
 We've topped out, we've topped out

354
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:31,980
 Humans are officially going downhill now

355
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:37,820
 Are you going to tell us where these fish came from?

356
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:40,780
 Yeah, so they don't we think there's no evidence that this happens

357
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:44,220
 Although it tends to be what everyone still thinks is the cause of fish ending up in lakes

358
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:49,420
 But the the latest theory which a few people sent us after the show because it was on a podcast that same week

359
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:54,460
 When you mentioned it and I think it was Jim Alcalely was saying that a Jim Alcalely podcast inside science

360
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:58,220
 That birds eat and this is going to sound even more ridiculous to the creationist

361
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,700
 But birds eat fish eggs

362
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:04,540
 But fish eggs actually survive going through their digestive tracts with some fish

363
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:08,540
 And then they poo them out when they're flying over a lake and the eggs end up in the lake

364
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,700
 I'll go with that

365
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,780
 You know, this is just going to annoy the Christians even more

366
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:17,100
 The reason you've got fish in lakes is acts of god, you know

367
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:23,180
 Huge storms where sea creatures get swept up into the air and then reigned on land

368
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:27,580
 All these there's always an act of god, right? That's god's throwing fish down

369
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:30,860
 He must be annoyed or happy or he's got too many fish or

370
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:35,020
 He's having a clear out and they land in the lakes

371
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,180
 Yeah

372
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:39,020
 Some stuff on trout maybe

373
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,060
 Yeah

374
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:43,100
 Female trout's fake orgasms. I'm sure you guys saw this

375
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:50,620
 So when a female is ready to spawn she kind of quivers a little bit and that kind of turns the male on

376
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:53,580
 And then he gives her his um sperm

377
00:29:53,580 --> 00:30:00,700
 But sometimes she will do that when she's not going to release any eggs because it makes all the other trout in the area horny

378
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:05,500
 And it's either that then she gets a really good mix of DNA from all the different trout

379
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:11,180
 Or that all the males then start fighting each other and so she ends up with the best possible male

380
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,900
 Oh clever. Yeah. Yeah

381
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:18,940
 Right, cool. So this was a study that was done by the swedish national board of fisheries

382
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:26,700
 A guy called Eric Peterson and they checked out 117 different spawnings and they found that 69 were false

383
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:31,500
 They were false orgasms and I just like it's a very sexy number to have landed on

384
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,860
 Sexy number

385
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:40,060
 All this just makes me think of Mike trout the

386
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:46,140
 Baseball player. Are you familiar with Mike trout? I am. He's like the best baseball player ever, isn't he?

387
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:53,420
 It's one of the all-time greats. He signed a contract in 2019 with the uh, the LA angels

388
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:56,300
 Uh for four hundred and twenty six million dollars

389
00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:03,260
 It was the singer at the time of signing it was the single biggest contract in the history of sport ever

390
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:07,580
 He's an extraordinary baseball player and I've actually seen him play

391
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:12,300
 Though like I love baseball and I was in Toronto working and I went to see the blue jays play

392
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:15,820
 And there it was and a guy when I went with a guy a Canadian guy

393
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:23,180
 I was working with and he has filled me in and that's trout that is trout that you're you're you are in the presence of greatness

394
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,820
 Why that is?

395
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:28,140
 The main thing that I know about him

396
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:34,540
 Is that they sold a baseball card of his for like five million quid or something last year or this year

397
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:37,820
 Maybe and it was the most anyone's ever spent on a baseball card

398
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,020
 um

399
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:42,140
 Wow, and I think like what I always thought about that was

400
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:45,900
 He is only and I think he's in his late 20s, isn't he?

401
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:51,980
 So there's so many chances that he gets cancelled in the next five or six years and that card just becomes complete

402
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:56,940
 It's not like buying it's not like buying a Babe Ruth one where you know, you know, this is kind of done

403
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:01,500
 You can't not be a fan of anyone except people whose careers are over just in case they

404
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:07,020
 I think they're not bought by fans. They're more bought by collectors, aren't they?

405
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:10,860
 Like the most money ever spent on a card before that

406
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:16,220
 I don't know the name of the guy but they only ever made one or two of these cards because he hated smoking

407
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:19,660
 And he refused to let cigarette companies sell his card

408
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:23,660
 And so they made one or two of them and he wasn't even a great baseball player

409
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:29,020
 I don't think but they you know it became really rare and then people paid millions of dollars for it. Wow

410
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:34,460
 Mike Trout, you want to tickle Mike Trout? That's the most expensive Trout you can possibly get

411
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,460
 Tickle Mike Trout into a trance

412
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:38,540
 Yeah, you're winning

413
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:42,460
 Is this one of these people he'd probably be good at any sport and I mean he could do anything

414
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,940
 Field any position

415
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:48,860
 Hit do anything better than anyone. If you had nine of him, you'd win every game

416
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:55,500
 So what you need is the keeper the keeper behind him just slowly tickling his bum as he's going to hit

417
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:59,980
 I don't know much about baseball rules, but I can't think that's allowed, is it?

418
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:03,260
 Very rarely do you it's not really a contact sport in that sense

419
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:08,300
 You're not going to get many opportunities to really tickle him to a coma, but if you get one take it

420
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,900
 Yeah

421
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:17,180
 Just one more thing on trout that I really liked is coral trout, which are these beautiful red spotty fish in the west west of the

422
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:20,300
 Pacific Ocean and they are doing this really clever thing

423
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:25,660
 Which it was previously thought was only possible for great apes and for ravens

424
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:31,420
 You know ravens are always super clever and essentially they recruit other animals to help them hunt

425
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:37,180
 And so they'll chase prey smaller fish into crevices, but they are too big and fat to squeeze into the crevices

426
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:42,780
 So they recruit eels and octopuses because octopuses have tentacles to get them out for them

427
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:46,140
 And they do that by going up to them and performing this series of signals

428
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:48,380
 Which essentially says hey, can you come on a hunt with me?

429
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:50,940
 And so they do kind of headstands

430
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:55,420
 They'll flip over onto their head and wiggle around and they'll do specific like head shakes

431
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:59,740
 And then they'll lead an eel or an octopus to where they've chased this bit of prey

432
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:03,420
 And they'll point at where they've got to go to get it out

433
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:06,780
 And it's they're the only animals aside from apes and ravens who are known to do

434
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:11,740
 Referential gestures as in you know when you're but you're pointing at something and they'll point and they'll say

435
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:17,580
 Can you go in there and get some of those fish out and in return the eel or the octopus which like puts its arm in there

436
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:21,820
 Gets a little bit of the fish catch as well. So they get to share it. That's amazing

437
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:27,260
 Like I'm even quite impressed by the eel in this situation because like if I pointed something

438
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:32,140
 To my cat the cat has no idea what I'm pointing at. She just looks at my finger, right?

439
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:36,140
 Yeah, so the fact that the eel even knows that that's what he's pointing at. I just

440
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,700
 I know that was an airplane

441
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:41,100
 Look at the garneel

442
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,900
 They don't point your things out

443
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,900
 Oh

444
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:56,700
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is james

445
00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:02,620
 Okay, my fact this week is that all of the cheese eaten on Antarctica is past its expiration date

446
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:05,740
 Yummy

447
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:09,820
 Yum. Yum. Yum. Why are we just sending them our rejected food?

448
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:15,660
 Well, this is well first of all, I saw this in a video on the pbs youtube page

449
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:19,900
 And it was an interview with tom senty who's the culinary manager in the mcmurdo galley

450
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:24,460
 And he was talking about how they get all the food in and he says basically all the food comes by boat

451
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:30,540
 And it takes so long to get to Antarctica and most of this cheese has got an expiration date of maybe one month

452
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:33,980
 Two months three months by the time it gets there. It's always out of date

453
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:38,300
 But they are in Antarctica. So luckily it's very cold. They can just freeze it and it's all fine

454
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:41,580
 But technically if they were in a shock, they wouldn't be able to sell it

455
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:47,820
 And you can always just scrape them all off. I suppose once it gets there, but yeah, exactly. It's cheese. Cheese

456
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:50,140
 That's forever, doesn't it?

457
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:55,660
 Exactly can't they drop food out of a plane? They can so

458
00:35:55,660 --> 00:36:00,460
 Every now and then I think like once every three or four months and only in the summer

459
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,780
 They do have a plane that comes with food

460
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,540
 But they can only fit so much in there

461
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:09,420
 And so they always go for the really fresh stuff like salad and vegetables and fruits and stuff like that

462
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:12,300
 Because they can get away with the cheese. They don't bring cheese in there

463
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:16,060
 So this is the last place that Deliveroo haven't got to

464
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:21,340
 I think it says go on and ask for a wagon mummers. Oh, yeah

465
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:26,460
 Your rider has left the restaurant. He'll be with you in nine months

466
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:29,900
 And then you look again and it's ten months

467
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:35,900
 He's nearby. Please go to resuscitate him

468
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:41,020
 He has hypothermia. It's a really amazing video this video

469
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:47,340
 You get to see it's a sort of journalist going around and showing you all of the canteens that you meet all the chefs and

470
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:51,340
 Basically, as james says, it's not just the cheese that it's expired

471
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:56,140
 Basically, most of the food has expired and it's all frozen and they have a phraser

472
00:36:56,140 --> 00:37:01,740
 Which is that expiration dates or a suggestion as opposed to as a thing that you meant to take for real

473
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:06,140
 But the way that they have to plan for these big ship contaminants of food to come in

474
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:12,300
 Mean that they're making a million meals and they have to plan that 18 months in advance for every time those shipments come

475
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,380
 So it's a huge operation

476
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:18,940
 It's mad level of meal planning. Me as someone who decides half an hour in advance what i'm having for dinner

477
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:22,700
 It must be helping the chefs and they get proper good chefs, don't they?

478
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,860
 so I think I was reading an interview with the

479
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:30,860
 British chef who says it's it's a quite a fun job because it's such a challenge

480
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:38,860
 But he'll make Thai curry and Moroccan tajin and meatballs and burritos and this is all with ingredients that arrived sort of eight months earlier

481
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:43,500
 And you do so he has to put in an order. It's like the most high pressure tesco order ever

482
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:47,100
 You put in an order once a year for all the food ingredients

483
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:51,740
 So you're going to need to last an entire year if you forget coriander. That's it

484
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,820
 You're done for

485
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:57,260
 But says on the on the youtube channel that if you don't get a delivery

486
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:05,100
 There's a lot of fish obviously in that article if you can catch it but other than that all the really is to eat is seal placenta

487
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:10,780
 Which the penguins laugh badly

488
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:14,460
 What's wrong with the rest of the seal?

489
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,780
 It must be the best bit

490
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:18,780
 But you couldn't get a seal I suppose

491
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,860
 Well, you don't have to catch the placenta

492
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:29,740
 They did used to bludgeon seals back in the day sort of when Scott was there and they would take the

493
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:34,620
 Blubbery bits and they would mix that into a porridge that they would make to sort of use that

494
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,380
 Which is disgusting

495
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:42,460
 But they're not allowed to do that anymore because there's this whole Antarctic treaty which got set up which sort of yeah the old

496
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:46,060
 Antarctic boring treaty that they set up

497
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:49,740
 Which means you can't yeah, you can't do that anymore. You can't sort of

498
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:56,060
 It's political greatness gone mad. I think we all agree

499
00:38:56,060 --> 00:39:01,180
 It does sound like they ate better back in the day like Scott's expedition obviously famously

500
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,860
 He didn't eat very well towards the end

501
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:07,900
 But when he was an Antarctic before he went to find the South Pole he lived at Cape Evans in a hut

502
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,700
 Which sounded like they were living the life of Riley

503
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:15,820
 So he wrote in his diary all the meals they had and they'd have things like sort of several courses

504
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:20,780
 They'd have turtle soup. They had a stewed penguin breast in red current jelly

505
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,180
 They were having crystallized ginger and champagne

506
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:28,300
 They cooked they used penguin blubber as oil to cook it and although apparently didn't taste very nice

507
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:35,260
 So they really I mean before he ended up accidentally going on an expedition where he only brought half the calories he needed

508
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:38,140
 Then he was living the high life

509
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:43,180
 Most interesting thing about Scott though is that he is the spitting image the doppelganger

510
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,900
 of John Lloyd the

511
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:49,740
 The reason that we all know one another the creator of

512
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:56,300
 Creator of qi and I know this because I went to I was touring in New Zealand and I went to a museum in Christchurch

513
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,780
 and because a lot of the Antarctic

514
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:02,220
 expeditions set off from New Zealand and they had a

515
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,460
 replica of the

516
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:08,140
 Of a hut that they were going to take with them and erect when they got there and it's a

517
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:11,980
 Well, you think of a hut you think of a shed, but this was really enormous

518
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:16,940
 several rooms and planks of wooden tables and and then a picture of

519
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:19,180
 There's the biggest double take I've ever done in my life

520
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:27,260
 On the wall dressed in some hundred year old explorer outfit standing in a heart in a sepia photograph was John Lloyd

521
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:30,620
 It's extraordinary

522
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:35,980
 It's a little known fact that the reason captain oats left the tent is because scott was just telling me all these tedious facts

523
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:40,540
 Another quite interesting thing about penguins. I'd go for a walk

524
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:43,740
 I may be some time

525
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:46,380
 No, it's quite interesting

526
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:51,500
 Um, eating penguins can be quite good for you or it was back in the day because it contains vitamin C

527
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,580
 Which would help you get scurvy

528
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,980
 Chocolate lots of chocolate chocolate on the outside

529
00:40:55,980 --> 00:41:04,540
 They should have taken more penguins on that expedition 200 000 penguins they have all lived

530
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:11,420
 The um the belgica uh when that got stopped in Antarctica in 1897

531
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:15,020
 They decided they were going to eat penguins to stop them from getting scurvy

532
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:18,140
 And so but they needed to catch some penguins, right?

533
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:24,060
 So they came up with a rule where every time that someone caught a penguin they would give them some money

534
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:27,420
 And just try and encourage people to go and catch penguins

535
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:32,700
 Uh, but then they realized that all you had to do was play a tune on your trumpet

536
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:37,180
 And the penguins would just come and stand right next to you because they loved the music so much

537
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:40,460
 And that became the way that they caught them all and so

538
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:47,260
 First of all, they would play the cornet or the trumpet and then there was one guy who pulled out his banjo and started playing a long way to Tipperary

539
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:51,820
 And apparently the penguins loved that and they would come right up to him and hang out with him

540
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:55,740
 And then one scottish member of the expedition started to play the bagpipes

541
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:59,980
 And apparently the penguins fled in terror and plunged back into the sea

542
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:12,460
 I went to the end of the festival and stayed in a hotel on Prince's street and uh, it's pretty busy Prince's street as you know

543
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:16,780
 But it's very very very quiet in the morning apart from 10 a.m

544
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:24,780
 Outside Waverly station a bagpiper starts up that i've never in my life wanted an air rifle more than that

545
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:30,140
 I think we can all empathize about to borrow that from my library

546
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:37,580
 Yeah, um the Antarctic was known as the womanless continent for a long time

547
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:40,060
 Because there were tiny women there

548
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:46,460
 Basically, um good name. Yeah, there was um the first women to go and stay further evidence

549
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:49,740
 That women are a bit a little bit less stupid than men

550
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:54,140
 Some men just kept sailing to this place

551
00:42:54,140 --> 00:43:01,420
 Getting out and dying and then other ones were like those men were idiots. I won't die if I go there and then they go there and die as well

552
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:08,780
 Well, I want to take credit but actually women were desperate to go weren't they they were um the first women to actually go and spend

553
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:14,300
 Like a year on the continent where uh two women called Jackie Ronnie and Jenny Darlington

554
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:17,580
 And they were actually the wives of two explorers

555
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:23,100
 And all the other men on the expedition signed the petition trying to stop it from happening

556
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,860
 Uh and when the two women arrived on the Antarctic base

557
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:33,980
 One person who was already there fled in fright thinking that he'd gone bad because he saw two women in Antarctic

558
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:45,340
 Um but women were explicitly banned from Antarctica until the 60s and 70s in America and the UK so as in

559
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:52,380
 British Americans banned them and it wasn't because we were too smart because thousands of women were applying right from the start of

560
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:57,660
 Antarctic exploration and they were bound on partly on the grounds that they'd tried to seduce everyone's husbands

561
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:02,460
 So I think the first woman who eventually went out with the British Antarctic survey Janet Thompson

562
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:09,100
 She had to go around and properly meet and talk to all the wives of the teammates that she'd be going with to convince them

563
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:13,500
 That she was an actual scientist and not just going out to seduce all of their husbands

564
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:20,220
 Which huge effort to go to there was another quote from the British Antarctic survey a few years later

565
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:25,100
 I think which when a bunch of women applied to go to Antarctica and were turned down

566
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:31,420
 They were turned down on the grounds that there are no facilities for women in the Antarctic. No shops. No hairdressers

567
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:33,820
 Wow

568
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:39,340
 And even like these days there are more men there, but the you know, it's getting more and more level

569
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:43,420
 I think the US Antarctic program is about 60 to 65 percent men

570
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:50,860
 But in the 1980s they had there was so many men there and so few women that they had something called the cysteine ceiling

571
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:56,540
 In weddle hut in Antarctica, which was basically the ceiling of this whole hut was covered in

572
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:59,980
 naked pornographic pictures of women and

573
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:08,140
 In the 1980s there was an attempt by some Australians to turn that ceiling into an australian national heritage site of high significance

574
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:16,540
 Right, so what do you mean they kept it as it is? They wanted to put it back as it was and um, you know have it as some special

575
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:22,540
 site it was protected. So it's a bit of a mystery that they're so important to have a visual stimulus

576
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:26,220
 That you have to have the image in front of you. Yeah

577
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:33,100
 But you can't just can't just picture somebody naked in your head. Some people I just can't think of anyone

578
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:36,220
 I'm going to have to look at the actual photograph. Oh, there's one. Yes

579
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:40,380
 Some people can't picture things in their head. I can't picture things in my head

580
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:42,940
 Yeah, and that's why your ceiling is covered in porn, isn't it?

581
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:47,180
 As we say the pinnacle of human evidence

582
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:50,780
 I keep pointing them out to my cat. She's not interested. No

583
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:54,700
 No, there's a load of wheels lying on their backs on the floor

584
00:45:54,700 --> 00:46:05,980
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is my fact

585
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:12,860
 My fact this week is that in 1990 a british airways flight landed with one pilot in the cockpit and the other

586
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:15,500
 Hanging by his legs outside the front window

587
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:19,900
 It's an extraordinary story. So this was a british flight

588
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:27,500
 5 3 9 0 it left birmingham and it was heading for malaga in spain and um, they were just under 15 minutes into their flight

589
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:33,660
 They were cruising at 17,300 feet over oxfordshire when suddenly there was this huge loud bang in the cockpit

590
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:38,940
 The window on the pilot side on the left hand side suddenly flung away from the plane and

591
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:43,180
 Exposed the plane to all the air on the outside and the decompression was so great

592
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:49,900
 That the door that blocks off the pilots from the rest of the plane got ripped off its hinges

593
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:56,620
 Straight into the control panel as well as the pilot who got ripped out of the window of the plane

594
00:46:56,620 --> 00:47:00,620
 And only didn't disappear because his legs got caught on the control panel

595
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:05,500
 so he was just being whack back and forth on the plane on the outside and um

596
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:11,340
 The story goes that there was a first officer who came in to see if they needed refreshments, which i don't quite believe i think

597
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:16,380
 When the doors ripped off and the plane is sent into a descent

598
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:24,460
 Um, he comes in anyway. He sees the pilot outside the front window and quickly runs and grabs his legs and has to hold him

599
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:28,300
 And the story ends with them having to make an emergency landing

600
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:33,340
 They spend 22 minutes from the moment that it happens to landing and they successfully land

601
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:36,700
 And um, he's alive. It's an extraordinary survival story

602
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:43,900
 But that's the other brilliant bit about this story that i like was two things one was that the flight attendants were taking interns to hang on to

603
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:49,500
 Because it was really exhausting and freezing cold and there was no the air was thin

604
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:54,380
 There were and they but also that they thought he was dead. They thought they were hanging on

605
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:59,340
 They thought they were hanging on to a dead person and the reason that they kept hanging on

606
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:02,540
 Was because they were worried that if they let go

607
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:05,420
 He might get sucked into the engine

608
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:13,260
 Oh, take the whole plane down potentially. Oh my days. So they were he was unconscious, right? He lost consciousness

609
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:19,420
 So it's only when they landed and they kind of i don't know how delicately they dragged him back into the witness

610
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:28,140
 But believing as they did that he was dead often if they put that point they then just dropped him out the window and he'd landed on the runway

611
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:33,660
 That might have killed him but to their amazement

612
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:38,780
 He was alive and rushed to hospital. Wow, and that's good. I hope they never told him

613
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:43,020
 I hope he woke up and said god. Thank you so much for saving my life and they didn't say no, mate

614
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:45,020
 We were just trying to stop you fucking up the engine

615
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:54,300
 It is extraordinary pretty incredible when the guy the one of the flight attendants got frostbite in his eye

616
00:48:54,300 --> 00:49:01,420
 Wow and suffered per PTSD, but they there's such a suction that they they think that he's

617
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:05,180
 The equivalent weight of 500 pounds they were hanging on to

618
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:07,980
 so really terrific

619
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:13,900
 Feet of endurance and strength to save this guy or really it's bizarre story

620
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:20,780
 What is that that's about the weight of sort of four people, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Well, well two large blocks

621
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:25,500
 It's fake it's like two greg davis

622
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:31,420
 And seeing it all I mean it's kind of amazing that the passengers got to see everything

623
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:36,060
 Yeah, I think that's that's a real perk for the anecdote purposes once you're back on earth

624
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:39,740
 So the door blew off. Oh, would you rather not know what was happening? Maybe

625
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:43,180
 Certainly at the time you'd rather think everything was fine and handy, but

626
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:45,980
 Yeah, then you get two weeks in Southampton

627
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:50,940
 Um, what I found amazing is that in 2018 this happened again

628
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:55,340
 So there was a there was a Sichuan Airlines plane

629
00:49:55,340 --> 00:50:01,660
 Going to Tibet and there was again the windscreen went and the pilot got sucked out

630
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:07,980
 And the co-pilot said I looked over to my side and half of my co-pilot's body was hanging out of the window

631
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:10,380
 Fortunately, he was wearing a seatbelt

632
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:15,020
 So they only got halfway out and they managed to pull him back in

633
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:20,700
 But that apparently it's a thing that happens. That is an advert for seatbelts if you ever get into one

634
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:23,580
 I don't ever take your seatbelt off in a plane

635
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:30,620
 Really, because if it's like something does go wrong, it's not by chance. So I'll probably be all right anyway

636
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:33,180
 No, you'll definitely go out the window

637
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:36,300
 It's nothing gonna say

638
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:40,700
 We should say so the reason that this happened was because the windscreen itself had been

639
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:45,020
 Refitted to the plane the night before and the wrong bolts had been used to secure it

640
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:47,340
 So they were half a millimeter too small

641
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:52,780
 And so it just couldn't handle the intense air pressure once it was up there and that's why it blew out

642
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:57,740
 So since then they've changed it so that they've stopped bolting them out a from the outside

643
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:01,980
 They now do it from the inside which um, it just apparently is a bit more helpful

644
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:07,260
 And uh, they make sure to use the proper bolts. This is just for anyone who's currently on the plane listening to us

645
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:10,780
 It's not going to happen again. Don't worry

646
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:14,140
 Okay, good to know they're making sure to use the proper bolts. How

647
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:20,380
 I mean, it's amazing the stuff that can go wrong. There was this 1983

648
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:22,300
 Canada flight

649
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:26,220
 Where the pilots have to check that so you check the fuel levels before you take off

650
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:29,100
 so you know how much fuel to put in the tank for your journey

651
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:33,660
 And they were a bit understaffed so the pilots had to do the checking themselves and they did it

652
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:36,380
 The electronic system was broken. So they had to use a dipstick

653
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:39,740
 So they just dip the dipstick into the fuel tank pulled it out

654
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:42,540
 You've got to figure out the volume from that and then from that

655
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:48,940
 They have to do the calculations to figure out the mass of fuel so they know how much to add and to add an extra complication

656
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:51,020
 They just switched to the metric system

657
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:54,380
 Which confused them so they used the wrong calculation

658
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:58,220
 They used a calculation as if they were converting to pounds rather than kilos

659
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:04,380
 Which given that 2.2 pounds is one kilogram meant they ended up with just under half the amount of fuel they needed

660
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:09,980
 And because their systems are broken they didn't get a warning until the plane engine just completely cut off

661
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:15,660
 And they started plummeting out the sky and fortunately the captain was an experienced glider pilot

662
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:18,940
 Which always comes in handy and so he glid them down

663
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:23,580
 Just about to safety although he did break the nose off the plane

664
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:28,060
 But it's quite confusing was that pilot hero or was he a moron?

665
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:31,900
 I mean, he did cock up the calculations. Yeah

666
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:38,060
 It's interesting, isn't it that planes they can glide down can't they really in theory a

667
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:42,460
 An aeroplane is designed so that even if both of the engines go it can

668
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:48,620
 Glide for quite a long time and actually the chance of surviving depends on how high you are because

669
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:53,980
 Obviously the higher you are the further you can get and the easier it is to get to an actual airport

670
00:52:53,980 --> 00:53:00,620
 And apparently I was talking to my wife about this who is a helicopter pilot as you guys know and I was asking her like

671
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:03,660
 If we were flying in a helicopter and she collapsed

672
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:10,140
 Would I be able to land the helicopter and she reckons that there's about a 50-50 chance that I would be able to do it

673
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:14,700
 No way and survive. That's what she reckons. I reckon. Yeah, it seems a lot

674
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:17,340
 She buys into this whole thing about your family being the peak of evil

675
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:23,020
 She thinks you're an actual genius. She thinks I could jump out and just fly down. But no

676
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:29,740
 James when you say she collapses is she still telling you what to do or are you just taking control?

677
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:33,740
 She said that the main problem first of all would be throwing her body out of the helicopter

678
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:37,980
 And getting the controls before it went out of control. But if I managed to do that

679
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:41,740
 She why do you need to throw the body out? What if that it's that pilot situation again?

680
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:47,180
 And she's just fallen unconscious. It's quite small helicopter and you know, I just want to look we want to stretch out

681
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:49,740
 I want to stretch my arms

682
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:57,580
 I got to say the the 50% side of you surviving kind of makes you a dick if you do survive

683
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:01,900
 There's a lot of unfortunate things you need to do to survive there

684
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:06,780
 Apparently I wouldn't be able to hover by be able to probably make quite a hard landing

685
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:11,340
 That's a crash, right? That's a crash

686
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:17,420
 It's a crash, but the survival would be the survival would be approximately 50% but I don't know

687
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:21,820
 That's what she says. Um, I had a quite my favorite plane based story from the year

688
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:25,180
 Is one that I read about a couple of months ago, but it's that

689
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:31,180
 A there was a french businessman 64 years old and his colleagues got him a present

690
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:36,380
 And they got him like an experience present and what they got him was a flight on a fighter jet

691
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:39,180
 And this was in spite of the fact as he said afterwards

692
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:43,500
 He'd never expressed any interest at all in planes or fighter jets or desire to go in one

693
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:49,500
 So they got him this flight in this amazing fighter jet and he it took off and he felt really unstable

694
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:52,780
 He said he sort of flew off his seat as it took off because you know g-force and everything

695
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:56,540
 And he grabbed at the nearest lever to try and stabilize himself

696
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:59,340
 And what that lever was was the ejection mechanism

697
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:05,020
 And so he accidentally ejected himself from the plane. So the roof flies at the plane

698
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:11,820
 He flies out of the plane and had to surprise parachute land into a field and be taken

699
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:17,100
 Immediately to hospital where he was absolutely fine, but resentful of his colleagues

700
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:22,620
 So funny, I think the ejection mechanism shouldn't be that accessible

701
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:25,580
 Well, you do need it if you're kind of

702
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:29,660
 Imagine if it wasn't accessible and you did actually want to leave the plane

703
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:34,220
 Yeah, and then you have to you have to solve a rubik's cube just to get out of the plane or something

704
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:39,260
 Yeah, my first is in lemon but not

705
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:46,220
 Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts

706
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:47,660

 Which is out now and uh, it's it's available amazon and that new book repository thing

716
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:37,100
 Which is really good should have looked that up, but I didn't just type it in and buy it

717
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:45,500
 Yes, please buy my book from your local bookseller. That's what you meant down

718
