00:00:13,00:00:17,That's right. And the second banana has joined us this week as well
00:00:17,00:00:23,"No, it is his name is his name is Alan Davis and he is the main big banana"
00:00:23,00:00:27,He is the biggest banana of all the bunch of people who work at QI
00:00:27,00:00:33,He's our absolute best mate and he's come along to tell us a load of facts that we didn't already know
00:00:33,00:00:39,"That's right. Yeah, and we also want to just quickly mention that he has a new book out. It's an extraordinary book"
00:00:39,00:00:46,It's called just ignore him and it is a memoir of which Stephen Fry former co-host on QI second banana
00:00:46,00:00:49,second banana to Alan
00:00:49,00:00:56,Said it's funny sad frightening sweet savage and tender just ignore him will never leave you and that's what all the critics are
00:00:56,00:01:00,Saying about it as well. It has had universal praise and we highly highly recommend it
00:01:00,00:01:05,"Yeah, it's an absolutely brilliant book. It's just I mean you probably know Alan"
00:01:05,00:01:12,"There's just this funny happy-go-lucky guy, but it really really gets down to what made him who he is and I can't recommend it"
00:01:12,00:01:17,Enough. It's just such a great great book. It's available presumably in all good book shops
00:01:17,00:01:22,I guess even the shit ones even the shit one so definitely go out and get that but in the meantime
00:01:22,00:01:27,You can hear him doing what he does best which is being unbelievably funny and this week show
00:01:27,00:01:32,Okay on with the podcast on with the show top banana
00:01:32,00:01:52,Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast coming to you
00:01:52,00:01:57,From four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Shriver
00:01:57,00:02:01,I am sitting here with James Harkin Anna Tashinsky and special guest
00:02:01,00:02:03,It's Alan Davis and once again
00:02:03,00:02:10,We have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here
00:02:10,00:02:12,We go starting with you
00:02:12,00:02:13,Alan
00:02:13,00:02:21,"Well, I've found for you from the Lizmore library in Australia an unusual approach you can borrow a"
00:02:22,00:02:24,person
00:02:24,00:02:27,The human library it's called
00:02:27,00:02:34,And the human library was started to create a space and this is the from the founder Ronnie Abergel
00:02:34,00:02:39,You could walk in borrow a human being and talk to them about a very challenging topic
00:02:39,00:02:41,"Ideally, we wanted people to talk about issues"
00:02:41,00:02:49,They would normally would not talk about or don't like to talk about and so you get you get a human book and that's a volunteer
00:02:49,00:02:52,From a diverse background where they have experiences
00:02:52,00:02:59,They're willing to share and they have titles the human books have titles like black activists or chronic depression or
00:02:59,00:03:02,survivor of trafficking
00:03:02,00:03:13,Really really bad Edinburgh experience
00:03:18,00:03:20,Shotlifter
00:03:20,00:03:33,That's such a good point about Edinburgh though imagine getting that in your review. Have you thought of being a human book instead?
00:03:33,00:03:40,There is a photo here and it's just you just sit at a table for someone you sit at a table with a human book
00:03:40,00:03:44,And then and you borrow them from her for an amount of time
00:03:44,00:03:50,"Hmm. I mean, I don't know. It's been that Monty Python sketch, you know, when you get an argument"
00:03:50,00:03:57,"So it goes in and says I've come here for an argument they go. No, you haven't"
00:03:57,00:04:05,But I think it must be really like imagine if you're one of these books and like you're there for a few days
00:04:05,00:04:09,"And no one takes you out that must be pretty depressing. Yeah, that's yeah bad stick"
00:04:09,00:04:13,They have a thing where so they all sit in a sort of waiting room
00:04:13,00:04:15,which they call the bookshelf and
00:04:15,00:04:21,They have a matchmaker so someone says I want to get a human book out and the librarian match makes you with a type of book
00:04:21,00:04:26,"I give they give you the list, but but here's an interesting thing while they're waiting to be chosen"
00:04:26,00:04:30,It can obviously get a bit boring there so they can borrow each other out while they're waiting
00:04:30,00:04:32,It's like
00:04:32,00:04:37,"Sorry, I didn't realize"
00:04:38,00:04:40,Before
00:04:40,00:04:49,Do they have barcodes on them? I mean if you try to smuggle out a book under your jacket
00:04:49,00:04:54,I found it under the bed. It's been there for two years. Oh
00:05:07,00:05:09,It's not just this Lismore library in Australia
00:05:09,00:05:15,So this was launched back in 2000 in Copenhagen by who Alan mentioned earlier Ronnie and a few others
00:05:15,00:05:22,And it sort of went around to festivals and they had people where you could rent them out at Ross Kilda festival and so on and then it's
00:05:22,00:05:24,Sort of the idea latched on and it's spread out
00:05:24,00:05:29,So it's an over 70 countries now that you can go to certain libraries and they don't always have them waiting in the back room
00:05:29,00:05:31,They're not just permanently sitting there
00:05:31,00:05:35,It's sort of like on a Friday between the hours of nine and three or something like that
00:05:35,00:05:40,We have slots since COVID. They they have started doing it virtually
00:05:40,00:05:44,"So you can you can borrow one, you know"
00:05:44,00:05:51,It's all about diversity and you know understanding people from other backgrounds or races or cultures. It's very good
00:05:51,00:05:54,"Yeah, it's a good plan. It's it's challenging your"
00:05:54,00:05:57,"preconceptions, I guess isn't it?"
00:05:57,00:06:01,"Making you people making some friends, you know, if you're really lonely. Well, that's it"
00:06:01,00:06:06,"I mean, we're now recording recording this in the second lockdown and everyone's sick to the back teeth of all the people"
00:06:06,00:06:08,They normally zoom
00:06:08,00:06:12,With the quiz markets falling off and cliff
00:06:12,00:06:17,I know it's like you get sick of the people you live with and then sick of the people you zoom
00:06:17,00:06:20,"Yeah, and then I'm sick of my Amazon delivery guy now"
00:06:20,00:06:25,"Well, it's time to go to the human library"
00:06:27,00:06:32,"Libraries are really trying to branch out in the modern day, right, you know, because people often don't use them anymore"
00:06:32,00:06:37,So they say they're trying to get to grips with the digital age and now they just hire out loads of random stuff
00:06:37,00:06:42,so there's this woman Barbara stripling who's the president of the American Library Association and
00:06:42,00:06:50,She says that local libraries are constantly getting calls from people like plumbers or electronic specialists saying
00:06:50,00:06:53,Do you want to put me in your books catalogue and you can rent me out?
00:06:53,00:06:59,You can hire me out to people who you know need a plumber or need to learn about how to wire a plug and
00:06:59,00:07:03,So actually you can hire people for practical purposes as well
00:07:03,00:07:07,"I think it'd be a weird thing to do to go to your library as a first port of cool if your toilets blocks, but"
00:07:07,00:07:09,It's worth a try currently
00:07:09,00:07:17,"I really I have a lot of faith in YouTube for all of those things. Yeah. Yes. Yeah, I had to sew up"
00:07:17,00:07:23,My five-year-olds one of his poor patrol toys that have split down its back
00:07:23,00:07:28,It was Marshall for those of you interested in the best
00:07:28,00:07:33,"Great guy. I love him. That's the prone. That's why he's funny. Yeah, and"
00:07:33,00:07:37,"Ironically, it's he's the one who got split down his back"
00:07:37,00:07:40,Typical Marshall
00:07:40,00:07:47,And I got a needle and thread for the first time since I don't know when this century and start and then thought how do you finish?
00:07:47,00:07:49,"Oh, I must have been taught this at primary school"
00:07:49,00:07:54,I'm sure but I don't remember and I found a YouTube video that told me how to sew
00:07:54,00:07:58,"Wow, and how do you finish you do like a little knot at the end or something?"
00:07:58,00:08:00,You don't put it all the way through you leave a loop and go in that
00:08:00,00:08:05,And they do another one of those and then you're done. I've left
00:08:05,00:08:08,Proudly left Marshall on the table
00:08:13,00:08:18,"Well, we started talking about Paw Patrol that was so much in his comfort zone"
00:08:18,00:08:22,I've ever seen him on this podcast. He was like
00:08:22,00:08:31,Just on Anna you were just talking about things that you could take out from libraries
00:08:31,00:08:34,"Yeah, curious things so outside of people you can also get really"
00:08:34,00:08:40,Sort of practical things for your house like light the Philadelphia library allows you to get cake pans for if you're baking
00:08:40,00:08:45,"That's pot so you can get a book and a cake pan. Yeah, you can at the Ann Arbor Library of Michigan as well"
00:08:45,00:08:50,You can rent out lots of weird tools and it says we only stocked the unusual tools that you might not have in your own house
00:08:50,00:08:57,"Which is a kind of a good idea, right? Because with a cake pan, you know, I'm only gonna make one cake every three years or whatever"
00:08:57,00:09:04,So I don't want to buy a whole pan for it much better to just hire it out in my time. I've lived with several unusual tools
00:09:04,00:09:08,They know who they are
00:09:09,00:09:12,"Um guys, this is on books and"
00:09:12,00:09:16,Fagely this fact and we just never mentioned on the show
00:09:16,00:09:21,And I think we should talk about the fact that Boris Johnson wrote a novel in 2004. Has any of you read it?
00:09:21,00:09:23,"No, I've seen it"
00:09:23,00:09:29,It's called something virgins very very well done. It's a certain number of virgins
00:09:32,00:09:39,"It's littered with racial stereotypes, isn't that right? I think I read about it in the Guardian"
00:09:39,00:09:43,The racial stereotype detectives column
00:09:43,00:09:48,"Well, you won't be surprised to know the telegraph called it effortlessly brilliant"
00:09:48,00:09:56,"This is genius, this is exactly what I think"
00:09:56,00:10:00,Therefore it must be excellent
00:10:01,00:10:04,It does sound I mean it's extraordinary first of all
00:10:04,00:10:11,It's about a sort of bumbling gaffe prone bike riding MP who's vaguely in trouble for a sexual indiscretion and
00:10:11,00:10:14,It's a Marina Hyde read it
00:10:14,00:10:19,So we don't have to and tweeted a few of the quotes from it one quote is Boris Johnson wrote these words
00:10:19,00:10:22,She was looking this may sound crude
00:10:22,00:10:28,But it is no less than the truth like a lingerie model only cleverer and if anything with bigger breasts
00:10:29,00:10:36,"Just write those words in a book although it is meant to be a farce so to be fair. Well, that's what his premiership is turning out to"
00:10:36,00:10:45,I read about that. I read an article that suggests that people who are storytellers like Boris Johnson as you say
00:10:45,00:10:48,Have more children than non storytellers
00:10:48,00:10:52,This was a couple of
00:10:52,00:10:59,anthropologists who are looking at the Agta people who live in the Philippines and they're a hunter-gatherer group and they don't really
00:10:59,00:11:03,Then one of these groups that aren't really affected by the Western world very much
00:11:03,00:11:10,And they looked at the people who tell the stories in the group and they found that they are more desirable social partners
00:11:10,00:11:13,They ask people of all these ones this guy does lots of
00:11:13,00:11:18,Finding food and this guy tells lots of stories and this guy does a lot of fixing things
00:11:18,00:11:23,Who would you most like to have sex with most of the people said they wanted to have sex with the storytellers?
00:11:23,00:11:28,"Really? Yeah, is that because they don't have poor patrol to put on for five hours there"
00:11:28,00:11:32,So they know when they have kids they need someone who's going to sit up doing the bedtime story thing
00:11:32,00:11:37,They didn't they didn't come up with any idea why it might be the case. They just said it was the case
00:11:37,00:11:44,"Interesting. Well, it does figure doesn't it? Good old Boris. Maybe the only way to shut the storyteller up is to have sex with them"
00:11:54,00:12:02,I was reading about in terms of old storytelling traditions in China. They have pingshu which is a
00:12:02,00:12:04,version of the
00:12:04,00:12:10,Any sort of group that has that one person who knows all of the stories and all the traditions of the people and what led them to
00:12:10,00:12:14,This current point that's their version of it and for a very long time
00:12:14,00:12:18,these people were so revered that radio channels would just play them and
00:12:18,00:12:24,Farmers would have the radio out there listening to these long stories and those classic Chinese stories that date back
00:12:24,00:12:32,From ages and ages ago that they're simply telling over and over but as far as I can tell pingshu is a bit different to other storytellers in that
00:12:32,00:12:34,While they're telling the story
00:12:34,00:12:38,They break off to give commentary about it and the commentary is their own personal opinion
00:12:38,00:12:43,Which they could go on for 20 minutes or so and it's a tradition that is kind of still going on
00:12:43,00:12:48,So the old stories aren't engaging the kids anymore. So they have to use news stories
00:12:48,00:12:50,So there's a guy who's been going since 2012
00:12:51,00:12:56,Telling in pingshu the entire harry potter book series and he's going to finish it
00:12:56,00:13:02,Some he's on the order of the phoenix right now in 2020. So that's book five
00:13:02,00:13:06,I believe and so these little diversions in in the second book
00:13:06,00:13:09,You've got the three-headed dog in chamber of secrets
00:13:09,00:13:15,He'll then go into greek mythology for 20 minutes to talk about the three-headed dog away from the so it's the worst to me
00:13:15,00:13:20,"Kind of storytelling. Yeah, you want to hear the story and then your son again 20 minutes about the greek info"
00:13:20,00:13:25,"You know, yeah, it's like someone leaning over your shoulder when you're reading going. I love this bit of this bit"
00:13:25,00:13:28,"Oh, this guy's awful, isn't he? You don't you don't want that. I think it sounds"
00:13:28,00:13:33,"Does it not sound more like footnotes or something? That's true. Actually, that's true"
00:13:33,00:13:36,How quickly I've buckled I'm really into it
00:13:36,00:13:39,Sounds awesome
00:13:39,00:13:41,James do all your favorite works of fiction have footnotes
00:13:41,00:13:45,"Well, I think the problem is that I don't really read fiction very much"
00:13:45,00:13:50,"I read a lot of nonfiction and what dan's describing sounds more like a nonfiction thing, doesn't it?"
00:13:50,00:13:54,It sounds more like okay. Now we're going to tell you some facts about Kerberus or whatever
00:13:54,00:13:59,"And to me that's I guess I just need to read more fiction. Well, sometimes you can get"
00:13:59,00:14:07,"Like if you're reading a dickens book, for example, yeah, these books are so full of references in the day"
00:14:07,00:14:13,"They're written in many, you know, published as they were a magazine form is full of jokes about characters of the time"
00:14:13,00:14:17,And so the footnotes in those books or they usually notes at the back of the volume
00:14:18,00:14:23,Pages and pages in here he refers to and here this is about and this is a popular song of the time
00:14:23,00:14:25,And this is the right of the time and this is someone think it's hated
00:14:25,00:14:29,"Yeah, that's what you can you can go to those or"
00:14:29,00:14:35,"Or not. Yeah, I love the footnote. Actually, it's kind of the best bit sometimes, you know, full. It's full of weird"
00:14:35,00:14:37,facts
00:14:37,00:14:41,"I think um, James, I think you found something recently about how if"
00:14:41,00:14:45,"Um, people didn't have somewhere to sleep for the night, but they couldn't afford a bed in a homeless house"
00:14:45,00:14:51,"Yeah, you could sit up on seats. Can I just say we shouldn't be saying this to Alan because it will be on qi next year"
00:14:51,00:14:57,If it wasn't for the fact that I 100 know that he will have forgotten it by the time it goes out
00:14:57,00:14:59,"We shouldn't be saying it, but um, yeah"
00:14:59,00:15:01,"Sorry, what did you say?"
00:15:01,00:15:06,So in victorian times if you didn't have anywhere to live but you're working in the city
00:15:06,00:15:07,But you needed somewhere to sleep
00:15:07,00:15:10,You could pay one pence and you would be able to sit on a bench for the night
00:15:10,00:15:14,"Or you could pay two pence and you'd be able to hang over the top of a rope, right?"
00:15:15,00:15:20,"The rope would go underneath your armpits and then you would kind of sleep there and that is it dickens, isn't it? Is it?"
00:15:20,00:15:27,It's it's I remember I read about that in a footnote in one of the dickens. Yeah. Yeah one of the dickens is
00:15:27,00:15:31,So they're good. They're maybe good fiction for you to start with james full of footnotes or david foster wallis
00:15:31,00:15:34,If you want more footnotes than actual fiction
00:15:34,00:15:42,"Okay, any footnotes in the borris johnson, but um a lot of very arcane references that yeah, you need tons of footnotes for those"
00:15:42,00:15:45,It did sell more than the last book we wrote. Just want to make that clear
00:15:45,00:15:57,"You can get eddie is arts written in autobiography, uh, which is a great find especially like eddie, but"
00:15:57,00:16:02,"He's got lots of footnotes in it, but so in the audio book that I listen to he reads the footnotes"
00:16:02,00:16:09,But of course eddies always digresses in his in his comedy. It's big part of what it does is digression digression digression
00:16:09,00:16:15,But instead of just digressing he reads it as a book so you'll talk for a bit and then you'll go footnote
00:16:15,00:16:17,And then he'll tell you something and then he'll say
00:16:17,00:16:22,End of footnote and then he will carry on talking and then you go footnote
00:16:22,00:16:27,"After a while, you're going stop saying footnote. Just read it out"
00:16:27,00:16:35,Single greatest digress so it needs to be English language and now you're going foot end of footnote
00:16:38,00:16:41,"I love it. I love eddie dearly, but I could not listen to that"
00:16:41,00:16:46,Yeah edit those out. Maybe he'll hear this and go back and edit the foot. Straight back to hillary mantel
00:16:46,00:16:53,Chapter 907 oh god don't get me started
00:16:53,00:17:04,"Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is anna"
00:17:04,00:17:09,My fact this week is that it's illegal in the uk to tickle a trout
00:17:09,00:17:15,"Trout tickling. Yeah, they don't like it. No, they do like it. That's the problem"
00:17:15,00:17:18,So I guess anyone have you guys ever
00:17:18,00:17:23,"Have you guys heard of trout tickling? Are you familiar with the concept? Have you ever tickled trout yourselves? Yeah, we have it in the north"
00:17:23,00:17:27,Can I just check that trout's not a euphemism here?
00:17:27,00:17:32,I don't want to be kind of uncool and know that you're all talking about the penis
00:17:34,00:17:36,It's great point
00:17:36,00:17:40,"If it is a euphemism, then I've misunderstood all of the articles I've read about"
00:17:40,00:17:48,It's an angling thing that goes back many hundreds of years and p fishman will talk about it
00:17:48,00:17:52,And it's what you do is you dip your hand if you're trying to catch a trout without a rod
00:17:52,00:17:58,Then you dip your hands in the water. I was actually speaking to someone. I know who says he's done it yesterday
00:17:58,00:18:02,Dip your hands in the water and you sort of want to chase a trout under a rock
00:18:02,00:18:03,They'll hide from you under a rock
00:18:03,00:18:08,Then you go underneath the trout and you pull your hands up gradually until you're touching it
00:18:08,00:18:12,And then you want to touch it at the tail end and then just sort of tickle its little belly
00:18:12,00:18:17,Creeping your fingers up in a weird and pervy way until you've tickled it right up to the head
00:18:17,00:18:22,And it makes them go completely motionless. They seem to love it or it at least makes them catatonic
00:18:22,00:18:27,I heard of it. They go into a sort of a trance. Exactly. But that's illegal
00:18:27,00:18:29,It's illegal because
00:18:30,00:18:34,"It's illegal because it's um, well, so there's a lot of angry people online who say it's a hangover from"
00:18:34,00:18:39,Classism of the olden days essentially because it's thought of as poaching because
00:18:39,00:18:45,You if you don't have a rod then you can easily pretend that you weren't trying to poach fish from a river
00:18:45,00:18:49,So it's a way of getting away with stealing fish from someone's river without permission
00:18:49,00:18:53,And so it's illegal. You've got a fish with a rod in line or a net
00:18:53,00:18:58,You're allowed to do it if you're if you're on your own property and you have your own river going through your own property
00:18:59,00:19:02,"Um, I think you are allowed to do it, right? It's only in public"
00:19:02,00:19:11,"Lones, right? I can't remember years ago. I was on holiday with bill Bailey and in uh, indonesia and we were on this river"
00:19:11,00:19:14,Doing some sort of canoeing or rafting or something anyway
00:19:14,00:19:22,It was idyllic mountains and trees and tropical foliage everywhere and floating down the river and I thought this is perfect
00:19:22,00:19:27,"Oh, what a paradise. I understand my bill comes here all the time. It's just really takes you away from everything"
00:19:27,00:19:31,"He's always saying never got asthma while he was there. There's no pollution, etc."
00:19:31,00:19:31,etc
00:19:31,00:19:34,Then we go around the bend in the river and there's a local gentleman
00:19:34,00:19:38,With a car battery slung over his shoulder
00:19:38,00:19:41,connected to a metal pole
00:19:41,00:19:43,wading in the river
00:19:43,00:19:45,electrocute in fish
00:19:45,00:19:48,Oh my god
00:19:48,00:19:54,So it was suddenly completely removed from the ecstasy of communing with with nature
00:19:55,00:20:01,The brutal reality it's kind of the only time we've ever seen has seen a car battery used like that
00:20:01,00:20:03,Was in a film about the craze when they were torturing someone
00:20:03,00:20:07,"I mean, it's it's very resourceful"
00:20:07,00:20:11,You're going to get more fish that way really really effective. Yeah
00:20:11,00:20:13,"Oh, wow"
00:20:13,00:20:18,I think they they do try to uh people who actually are permissioned to try to kill trout like that in fact
00:20:18,00:20:21,so I think they're invasive trout in
00:20:21,00:20:22,Yellowstone lake
00:20:22,00:20:29,Which are eating up all the trout that's supposed to be there and they've tried to electrify the whole lake by
00:20:29,00:20:34,"So electrocuting all the eggs, but the water didn't conduct it well enough apparently weird because water's a good conductor"
00:20:34,00:20:37,So you've got to make sure you got the voltage for it. Yeah
00:20:37,00:20:44,And actually what they did and this is really creepy is they so this is Yellowstone lake and the native trout are the cutthroat trout
00:20:44,00:20:47,Which is confusing because they're the good guys who are meant to be there
00:20:47,00:20:51,And the invasive trout have come in they're eating them all up
00:20:51,00:20:55,And so the way eventually researchers have managed to get rid of the invasive trout
00:20:55,00:21:02,One of the ways is they suffocate the invasive ones by dumping loads of dead fish in the water
00:21:02,00:21:07,And then that removes the oxygen from get stops the oxygen from getting in and the eggs don't survive
00:21:07,00:21:12,So you see them like tipping all these fish back into the water suffocated by their own parents
00:21:12,00:21:18,But it's it's all in honor of saving the cutthroat trout. So it's actually sort of a good thing depending on which side of that fence you're falling on
00:21:18,00:21:21,Sound of the cutthroat trout. Yeah
00:21:21,00:21:26,How do they survive all the lack of oxygen though? Or is it they hang out in slightly different parts of the lake?
00:21:26,00:21:33,"And so you just got to pick your spot. Got it. Right. Um chart tickling is mentioned in Shakespeare, isn't it?"
00:21:33,00:21:35,I reckon if you looked in the um
00:21:35,00:21:37,In the footnotes it would be there
00:21:37,00:21:41,It's in twelfth night when malvolio walks in and malvolio's a bit stupid
00:21:41,00:21:46,Maria says here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling
00:21:46,00:21:51,Don't know if that that might be one of um Shakespeare's weird sexy jokes that no one gets
00:21:51,00:21:56,"But I don't know. Yeah. Oh, could you imagine the riotous laughter at the globe?"
00:21:56,00:22:05,I actually I saw Stephen Fry being now malvolio and it was genuinely riotous laughter
00:22:05,00:22:10,"He's quite a talented man. So that's Stephen Fry. Yeah, I don't remember that specific line"
00:22:10,00:22:13,"this um, I was I was reading as well about these methods of"
00:22:13,00:22:16,unconventional fishing so
00:22:16,00:22:21,Electrifying and using chorobatteries in the water to get fish and one of the ways that a lot of people do
00:22:21,00:22:25,It is using dynamite. So dynamite fishing you pop a bunch of dynamite in
00:22:25,00:22:29,Blows up all the fish raised to the surface and you collect them
00:22:29,00:22:34,And that's a big problem for a lot of places where there's coral reefs because they're absolutely
00:22:34,00:22:38,Decimating all of these coral reefs and then the Philippines. It's a big problem in particular
00:22:38,00:22:43,So in 2010 a group called the sea knights decided to do something about it
00:22:43,00:22:49,Philippines is very very religious and so what they did was where the coral reef was they dumped at the bottom of the ocean
00:22:49,00:22:55,A 14 foot tall statue of the virgin Mary so that if anyone came by they would see the virgin Mary in the ocean
00:22:55,00:22:58,and want to pray to her as opposed to
00:22:58,00:23:03,"Decimate her with dynamite. So yeah, yeah, so they've gone back"
00:23:03,00:23:07,In 2018 eight years later and it seems to have worked. She's covered in coral
00:23:07,00:23:11,It's growing on her now and all the coral in the area seems to be vibrant again
00:23:11,00:23:15,Because no one's blowing it up and it's bringing a lot of tourists in so if you want to stop
00:23:15,00:23:20,"Yeah, any illegal poaching just pop a virgin Mary into your area and you should be fine"
00:23:20,00:23:25,"Popping a virgin Mary into your area again does sound like a euphemism, but that is ingenious"
00:23:25,00:23:29,It's better than popping a virgin Mary out of your area
00:23:29,00:23:33,Or is it?
00:23:33,00:23:37,In scotland it looks it looks like it's known as guddling
00:23:37,00:23:41,It is that's what my friend called it yesterday. He does it in the highlands
00:23:42,00:23:49,"Guddling guddler trout in scotland. It's like talking about guddling. It's a bit like cuddling, isn't it tickling and guddling and"
00:23:49,00:23:53,Touch it into a trance. It's a wonderful skill. Yeah
00:23:53,00:23:58,I read one person who does it who says you need to be very gentle and with a delicate touch
00:23:58,00:24:00,Much as though you are caressing your lover
00:24:00,00:24:04,"Wow, you then of course fry on the barbecue"
00:24:04,00:24:08,After you've gutted them
00:24:08,00:24:12,[Laughter]
00:24:12,00:24:19,Technically gobbling if you ever want to know the term specifically for trout if you're gutting a trout or chopping up a trout
00:24:19,00:24:23,It's called gobbling according to a book of carving from 1508
00:24:23,00:24:29,So I don't know if it's in common use anymore. A few watch that program. It's on bbc2. I think about it's called scotland from the sky
00:24:29,00:24:33,"No, yeah, I think I have seen it. It's really good"
00:24:33,00:24:38,And it's a kind of history history of scotland from the sky so aerial photography
00:24:38,00:24:42,But in getting to the sky and use there's all kinds of
00:24:42,00:24:45,lost history that's rediscovered and
00:24:45,00:24:47,and one of the
00:24:47,00:24:51,Things they were talking about in the last I'll watch it with my daughter. She loves it
00:24:51,00:24:57,And the last one was the lost herring industry scotland used to have this huge herring industry
00:24:58,00:25:03,And they used to export herring by the hundreds of tons to particularly to russia and
00:25:03,00:25:08,Germany and those markets disappeared with the second world war
00:25:08,00:25:12,But they would have herring girls and herring girls could gut herring
00:25:12,00:25:18,They had footage black and white footage of herring girls with buckets full of herring gutting them at a terrific rate
00:25:18,00:25:21,Cutting up 40 fish in a minute
00:25:21,00:25:26,It's absolutely extraordinary kind of lost art and lost industry
00:25:26,00:25:32,I wonder why it was the girls who did it just didn't the boys were on the boats and the girls were doing the gutting and that's how
00:25:32,00:25:34,That's how it worked
00:25:34,00:25:37,I remember reading about those herring girls and they used to you know
00:25:37,00:25:41,They were really cliquey and they would like do all the gutting in the daytime
00:25:41,00:25:45,And then they'd all go to the bars in the evening and they would never go home in between
00:25:45,00:25:49,So they'd go to the bars and they'd be covered in herring guts and you know
00:25:49,00:25:55,Really messy business the spell must be unbelievable
00:25:56,00:25:59,That's a human library book. You wouldn't want
00:25:59,00:26:10,"Yeah, it's gotten from the sky it's worth a watch"
00:26:10,00:26:17,There's another thing in there about creating this so they kind of can't create fish traps by building a kind of l shape
00:26:17,00:26:19,out of rock
00:26:19,00:26:25,Into a tidal river and as tide goes out fish get caught up here in the owl and then
00:26:25,00:26:30,The catch it was incredibly efficient way of catching fish so much so that
00:26:30,00:26:34,They had too many and then they ended up dead fish were poisoning the locks
00:26:34,00:26:38,"It became it was made illegal sometime in the 19th century, but it was yeah"
00:26:38,00:26:41,Yeah genius ways of trapping fish
00:26:41,00:26:44,The scots are all over it
00:26:44,00:26:48,Feels like cheating to me
00:26:48,00:26:54,"Yeah, um, you know we had a conversation a few weeks ago about how did all the fish get in the lakes?"
00:26:54,00:26:59,"Oh, yeah, and this weird mystery and I don't any guesses"
00:26:59,00:27:01,You know when you got late
00:27:01,00:27:04,Stick with basic evolution
00:27:04,00:27:08,"Helpless other than that basic evolution. Yeah, you're basically running the mill"
00:27:08,00:27:11,evolution
00:27:11,00:27:13,"Okay, I'm standing me but something like that"
00:27:13,00:27:19,"They just used to be a me but okay, thanks for that answer cut to 10 million years"
00:27:19,00:27:23,"Um, even Darwin doesn't agree with you there. So Darwin thought that"
00:27:24,00:27:28,The way that the fish had got into the lakes was the eggs that little fish eggs that attach to bird feathers
00:27:28,00:27:32,And then in the sea and then birds had flown and sort of dropped them over lakes
00:27:32,00:27:37,"Which is generally how people thought these fish got in lakes, but there's actually no"
00:27:37,00:27:40,"Christians Christians just laugh at it, you know"
00:27:40,00:27:46,"Yeah, whatever the eggs were on the wings of the birds, that's right"
00:27:46,00:27:50,I mean it sounds ridiculous
00:27:52,00:27:56,They've got a point but the thing is Alan who made the amoeba
00:27:56,00:27:59,"You know, we can all say that it went from amoeba to fish in the lake"
00:27:59,00:28:03,"But you know, you need the perfect conditions to create life"
00:28:03,00:28:09,"Liquid and you've got to be in the gold eloxone James. Okay, got it. It's not it's not Lancashire"
00:28:09,00:28:17,Wow life on earth did not start in Lancashire. I know you credit a lot of things with lancas. That's why life on earth did not begin there
00:28:17,00:28:20,But that is where it reached its absolute peak
00:28:21,00:28:23,In the Harkin household
00:28:23,00:28:27,"We've topped out, we've topped out"
00:28:27,00:28:31,Humans are officially going downhill now
00:28:31,00:28:37,Are you going to tell us where these fish came from?
00:28:37,00:28:40,"Yeah, so they don't we think there's no evidence that this happens"
00:28:40,00:28:44,Although it tends to be what everyone still thinks is the cause of fish ending up in lakes
00:28:44,00:28:49,But the the latest theory which a few people sent us after the show because it was on a podcast that same week
00:28:49,00:28:54,When you mentioned it and I think it was Jim Alcalely was saying that a Jim Alcalely podcast inside science
00:28:54,00:28:58,That birds eat and this is going to sound even more ridiculous to the creationist
00:28:58,00:29:00,But birds eat fish eggs
00:29:00,00:29:04,But fish eggs actually survive going through their digestive tracts with some fish
00:29:04,00:29:08,And then they poo them out when they're flying over a lake and the eggs end up in the lake
00:29:08,00:29:10,I'll go with that
00:29:10,00:29:12,"You know, this is just going to annoy the Christians even more"
00:29:12,00:29:17,"The reason you've got fish in lakes is acts of god, you know"
00:29:17,00:29:23,Huge storms where sea creatures get swept up into the air and then reigned on land
00:29:23,00:29:27,"All these there's always an act of god, right? That's god's throwing fish down"
00:29:27,00:29:30,He must be annoyed or happy or he's got too many fish or
00:29:30,00:29:35,He's having a clear out and they land in the lakes
00:29:35,00:29:37,Yeah
00:29:37,00:29:39,Some stuff on trout maybe
00:29:39,00:29:40,Yeah
00:29:40,00:29:43,Female trout's fake orgasms. I'm sure you guys saw this
00:29:44,00:29:50,So when a female is ready to spawn she kind of quivers a little bit and that kind of turns the male on
00:29:50,00:29:53,And then he gives her his um sperm
00:29:53,00:30:00,But sometimes she will do that when she's not going to release any eggs because it makes all the other trout in the area horny
00:30:00,00:30:05,And it's either that then she gets a really good mix of DNA from all the different trout
00:30:05,00:30:11,Or that all the males then start fighting each other and so she ends up with the best possible male
00:30:11,00:30:13,Oh clever. Yeah. Yeah
00:30:14,00:30:18,"Right, cool. So this was a study that was done by the swedish national board of fisheries"
00:30:18,00:30:26,A guy called Eric Peterson and they checked out 117 different spawnings and they found that 69 were false
00:30:26,00:30:31,They were false orgasms and I just like it's a very sexy number to have landed on
00:30:31,00:30:34,Sexy number
00:30:34,00:30:40,All this just makes me think of Mike trout the
00:30:40,00:30:46,"Baseball player. Are you familiar with Mike trout? I am. He's like the best baseball player ever, isn't he?"
00:30:46,00:30:53,"It's one of the all-time greats. He signed a contract in 2019 with the uh, the LA angels"
00:30:53,00:30:56,Uh for four hundred and twenty six million dollars
00:30:56,00:31:03,It was the singer at the time of signing it was the single biggest contract in the history of sport ever
00:31:03,00:31:07,He's an extraordinary baseball player and I've actually seen him play
00:31:07,00:31:12,Though like I love baseball and I was in Toronto working and I went to see the blue jays play
00:31:12,00:31:15,And there it was and a guy when I went with a guy a Canadian guy
00:31:15,00:31:23,I was working with and he has filled me in and that's trout that is trout that you're you're you are in the presence of greatness
00:31:23,00:31:25,Why that is?
00:31:25,00:31:28,The main thing that I know about him
00:31:28,00:31:34,Is that they sold a baseball card of his for like five million quid or something last year or this year
00:31:34,00:31:37,Maybe and it was the most anyone's ever spent on a baseball card
00:31:37,00:31:39,um
00:31:39,00:31:42,"Wow, and I think like what I always thought about that was"
00:31:42,00:31:45,"He is only and I think he's in his late 20s, isn't he?"
00:31:45,00:31:51,So there's so many chances that he gets cancelled in the next five or six years and that card just becomes complete
00:31:51,00:31:56,"It's not like buying it's not like buying a Babe Ruth one where you know, you know, this is kind of done"
00:31:56,00:32:01,You can't not be a fan of anyone except people whose careers are over just in case they
00:32:02,00:32:07,"I think they're not bought by fans. They're more bought by collectors, aren't they?"
00:32:07,00:32:10,Like the most money ever spent on a card before that
00:32:10,00:32:16,I don't know the name of the guy but they only ever made one or two of these cards because he hated smoking
00:32:16,00:32:19,And he refused to let cigarette companies sell his card
00:32:19,00:32:23,And so they made one or two of them and he wasn't even a great baseball player
00:32:23,00:32:29,I don't think but they you know it became really rare and then people paid millions of dollars for it. Wow
00:32:30,00:32:34,"Mike Trout, you want to tickle Mike Trout? That's the most expensive Trout you can possibly get"
00:32:34,00:32:36,Tickle Mike Trout into a trance
00:32:36,00:32:38,"Yeah, you're winning"
00:32:38,00:32:42,Is this one of these people he'd probably be good at any sport and I mean he could do anything
00:32:42,00:32:44,Field any position
00:32:44,00:32:48,"Hit do anything better than anyone. If you had nine of him, you'd win every game"
00:32:48,00:32:55,So what you need is the keeper the keeper behind him just slowly tickling his bum as he's going to hit
00:32:55,00:32:59,"I don't know much about baseball rules, but I can't think that's allowed, is it?"
00:33:00,00:33:03,Very rarely do you it's not really a contact sport in that sense
00:33:03,00:33:08,"You're not going to get many opportunities to really tickle him to a coma, but if you get one take it"
00:33:08,00:33:09,Yeah
00:33:09,00:33:17,"Just one more thing on trout that I really liked is coral trout, which are these beautiful red spotty fish in the west west of the"
00:33:17,00:33:20,Pacific Ocean and they are doing this really clever thing
00:33:20,00:33:25,Which it was previously thought was only possible for great apes and for ravens
00:33:25,00:33:31,You know ravens are always super clever and essentially they recruit other animals to help them hunt
00:33:31,00:33:37,"And so they'll chase prey smaller fish into crevices, but they are too big and fat to squeeze into the crevices"
00:33:37,00:33:42,So they recruit eels and octopuses because octopuses have tentacles to get them out for them
00:33:42,00:33:46,And they do that by going up to them and performing this series of signals
00:33:46,00:33:48,"Which essentially says hey, can you come on a hunt with me?"
00:33:48,00:33:50,And so they do kind of headstands
00:33:50,00:33:55,They'll flip over onto their head and wiggle around and they'll do specific like head shakes
00:33:55,00:33:59,And then they'll lead an eel or an octopus to where they've chased this bit of prey
00:33:59,00:34:03,And they'll point at where they've got to go to get it out
00:34:03,00:34:06,And it's they're the only animals aside from apes and ravens who are known to do
00:34:06,00:34:11,Referential gestures as in you know when you're but you're pointing at something and they'll point and they'll say
00:34:11,00:34:17,Can you go in there and get some of those fish out and in return the eel or the octopus which like puts its arm in there
00:34:18,00:34:21,Gets a little bit of the fish catch as well. So they get to share it. That's amazing
00:34:21,00:34:27,Like I'm even quite impressed by the eel in this situation because like if I pointed something
00:34:27,00:34:32,"To my cat the cat has no idea what I'm pointing at. She just looks at my finger, right?"
00:34:32,00:34:36,"Yeah, so the fact that the eel even knows that that's what he's pointing at. I just"
00:34:36,00:34:38,I know that was an airplane
00:34:38,00:34:41,Look at the garneel
00:34:41,00:34:43,They don't point your things out
00:34:43,00:34:45,Oh
00:34:45,00:34:56,"Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is james"
00:34:56,00:35:02,"Okay, my fact this week is that all of the cheese eaten on Antarctica is past its expiration date"
00:35:02,00:35:05,Yummy
00:35:05,00:35:09,Yum. Yum. Yum. Why are we just sending them our rejected food?
00:35:10,00:35:15,"Well, this is well first of all, I saw this in a video on the pbs youtube page"
00:35:15,00:35:19,And it was an interview with tom senty who's the culinary manager in the mcmurdo galley
00:35:19,00:35:24,And he was talking about how they get all the food in and he says basically all the food comes by boat
00:35:24,00:35:30,And it takes so long to get to Antarctica and most of this cheese has got an expiration date of maybe one month
00:35:30,00:35:33,Two months three months by the time it gets there. It's always out of date
00:35:33,00:35:38,But they are in Antarctica. So luckily it's very cold. They can just freeze it and it's all fine
00:35:38,00:35:41,"But technically if they were in a shock, they wouldn't be able to sell it"
00:35:41,00:35:47,"And you can always just scrape them all off. I suppose once it gets there, but yeah, exactly. It's cheese. Cheese"
00:35:47,00:35:50,"That's forever, doesn't it?"
00:35:50,00:35:55,Exactly can't they drop food out of a plane? They can so
00:35:55,00:36:00,Every now and then I think like once every three or four months and only in the summer
00:36:00,00:36:02,They do have a plane that comes with food
00:36:02,00:36:04,But they can only fit so much in there
00:36:04,00:36:09,And so they always go for the really fresh stuff like salad and vegetables and fruits and stuff like that
00:36:09,00:36:12,Because they can get away with the cheese. They don't bring cheese in there
00:36:12,00:36:16,So this is the last place that Deliveroo haven't got to
00:36:16,00:36:21,"I think it says go on and ask for a wagon mummers. Oh, yeah"
00:36:21,00:36:26,Your rider has left the restaurant. He'll be with you in nine months
00:36:26,00:36:29,And then you look again and it's ten months
00:36:32,00:36:35,He's nearby. Please go to resuscitate him
00:36:35,00:36:41,He has hypothermia. It's a really amazing video this video
00:36:41,00:36:47,You get to see it's a sort of journalist going around and showing you all of the canteens that you meet all the chefs and
00:36:47,00:36:51,"Basically, as james says, it's not just the cheese that it's expired"
00:36:51,00:36:56,"Basically, most of the food has expired and it's all frozen and they have a phraser"
00:36:56,00:37:01,Which is that expiration dates or a suggestion as opposed to as a thing that you meant to take for real
00:37:02,00:37:06,But the way that they have to plan for these big ship contaminants of food to come in
00:37:06,00:37:12,Mean that they're making a million meals and they have to plan that 18 months in advance for every time those shipments come
00:37:12,00:37:14,So it's a huge operation
00:37:14,00:37:18,It's mad level of meal planning. Me as someone who decides half an hour in advance what i'm having for dinner
00:37:18,00:37:22,"It must be helping the chefs and they get proper good chefs, don't they?"
00:37:22,00:37:24,so I think I was reading an interview with the
00:37:24,00:37:30,British chef who says it's it's a quite a fun job because it's such a challenge
00:37:30,00:37:38,But he'll make Thai curry and Moroccan tajin and meatballs and burritos and this is all with ingredients that arrived sort of eight months earlier
00:37:38,00:37:43,And you do so he has to put in an order. It's like the most high pressure tesco order ever
00:37:43,00:37:47,You put in an order once a year for all the food ingredients
00:37:47,00:37:51,So you're going to need to last an entire year if you forget coriander. That's it
00:37:51,00:37:53,You're done for
00:37:53,00:37:57,But says on the on the youtube channel that if you don't get a delivery
00:37:57,00:38:05,There's a lot of fish obviously in that article if you can catch it but other than that all the really is to eat is seal placenta
00:38:05,00:38:10,Which the penguins laugh badly
00:38:10,00:38:14,What's wrong with the rest of the seal?
00:38:14,00:38:16,It must be the best bit
00:38:16,00:38:18,But you couldn't get a seal I suppose
00:38:18,00:38:20,"Well, you don't have to catch the placenta"
00:38:24,00:38:29,They did used to bludgeon seals back in the day sort of when Scott was there and they would take the
00:38:29,00:38:34,Blubbery bits and they would mix that into a porridge that they would make to sort of use that
00:38:34,00:38:36,Which is disgusting
00:38:36,00:38:42,But they're not allowed to do that anymore because there's this whole Antarctic treaty which got set up which sort of yeah the old
00:38:42,00:38:46,Antarctic boring treaty that they set up
00:38:46,00:38:49,"Which means you can't yeah, you can't do that anymore. You can't sort of"
00:38:53,00:38:56,It's political greatness gone mad. I think we all agree
00:38:56,00:39:01,It does sound like they ate better back in the day like Scott's expedition obviously famously
00:39:01,00:39:02,He didn't eat very well towards the end
00:39:02,00:39:07,But when he was an Antarctic before he went to find the South Pole he lived at Cape Evans in a hut
00:39:07,00:39:10,Which sounded like they were living the life of Riley
00:39:10,00:39:15,So he wrote in his diary all the meals they had and they'd have things like sort of several courses
00:39:15,00:39:20,They'd have turtle soup. They had a stewed penguin breast in red current jelly
00:39:21,00:39:23,They were having crystallized ginger and champagne
00:39:23,00:39:28,They cooked they used penguin blubber as oil to cook it and although apparently didn't taste very nice
00:39:28,00:39:35,So they really I mean before he ended up accidentally going on an expedition where he only brought half the calories he needed
00:39:35,00:39:38,Then he was living the high life
00:39:38,00:39:43,Most interesting thing about Scott though is that he is the spitting image the doppelganger
00:39:43,00:39:45,of John Lloyd the
00:39:47,00:39:49,The reason that we all know one another the creator of
00:39:49,00:39:56,Creator of qi and I know this because I went to I was touring in New Zealand and I went to a museum in Christchurch
00:39:56,00:39:58,and because a lot of the Antarctic
00:39:58,00:40:02,expeditions set off from New Zealand and they had a
00:40:02,00:40:04,replica of the
00:40:04,00:40:08,Of a hut that they were going to take with them and erect when they got there and it's a
00:40:08,00:40:11,"Well, you think of a hut you think of a shed, but this was really enormous"
00:40:11,00:40:16,several rooms and planks of wooden tables and and then a picture of
00:40:17,00:40:19,There's the biggest double take I've ever done in my life
00:40:19,00:40:27,On the wall dressed in some hundred year old explorer outfit standing in a heart in a sepia photograph was John Lloyd
00:40:27,00:40:30,It's extraordinary
00:40:30,00:40:35,It's a little known fact that the reason captain oats left the tent is because scott was just telling me all these tedious facts
00:40:35,00:40:40,Another quite interesting thing about penguins. I'd go for a walk
00:40:40,00:40:43,I may be some time
00:40:43,00:40:46,"No, it's quite interesting"
00:40:46,00:40:51,"Um, eating penguins can be quite good for you or it was back in the day because it contains vitamin C"
00:40:51,00:40:53,Which would help you get scurvy
00:40:53,00:40:55,Chocolate lots of chocolate chocolate on the outside
00:40:55,00:41:04,They should have taken more penguins on that expedition 200 000 penguins they have all lived
00:41:04,00:41:11,The um the belgica uh when that got stopped in Antarctica in 1897
00:41:11,00:41:15,They decided they were going to eat penguins to stop them from getting scurvy
00:41:15,00:41:18,"And so but they needed to catch some penguins, right?"
00:41:18,00:41:24,So they came up with a rule where every time that someone caught a penguin they would give them some money
00:41:24,00:41:27,And just try and encourage people to go and catch penguins
00:41:27,00:41:32,"Uh, but then they realized that all you had to do was play a tune on your trumpet"
00:41:32,00:41:37,And the penguins would just come and stand right next to you because they loved the music so much
00:41:37,00:41:40,And that became the way that they caught them all and so
00:41:41,00:41:47,"First of all, they would play the cornet or the trumpet and then there was one guy who pulled out his banjo and started playing a long way to Tipperary"
00:41:47,00:41:51,And apparently the penguins loved that and they would come right up to him and hang out with him
00:41:51,00:41:55,And then one scottish member of the expedition started to play the bagpipes
00:41:55,00:41:59,And apparently the penguins fled in terror and plunged back into the sea
00:42:05,00:42:12,"I went to the end of the festival and stayed in a hotel on Prince's street and uh, it's pretty busy Prince's street as you know"
00:42:12,00:42:16,But it's very very very quiet in the morning apart from 10 a.m
00:42:16,00:42:24,Outside Waverly station a bagpiper starts up that i've never in my life wanted an air rifle more than that
00:42:24,00:42:30,I think we can all empathize about to borrow that from my library
00:42:31,00:42:37,"Yeah, um the Antarctic was known as the womanless continent for a long time"
00:42:37,00:42:40,Because there were tiny women there
00:42:40,00:42:46,"Basically, um good name. Yeah, there was um the first women to go and stay further evidence"
00:42:46,00:42:49,That women are a bit a little bit less stupid than men
00:42:49,00:42:54,Some men just kept sailing to this place
00:42:54,00:43:01,Getting out and dying and then other ones were like those men were idiots. I won't die if I go there and then they go there and die as well
00:43:02,00:43:08,"Well, I want to take credit but actually women were desperate to go weren't they they were um the first women to actually go and spend"
00:43:08,00:43:14,Like a year on the continent where uh two women called Jackie Ronnie and Jenny Darlington
00:43:14,00:43:17,And they were actually the wives of two explorers
00:43:17,00:43:23,And all the other men on the expedition signed the petition trying to stop it from happening
00:43:23,00:43:26,Uh and when the two women arrived on the Antarctic base
00:43:27,00:43:33,One person who was already there fled in fright thinking that he'd gone bad because he saw two women in Antarctic
00:43:33,00:43:45,Um but women were explicitly banned from Antarctica until the 60s and 70s in America and the UK so as in
00:43:45,00:43:52,British Americans banned them and it wasn't because we were too smart because thousands of women were applying right from the start of
00:43:52,00:43:57,Antarctic exploration and they were bound on partly on the grounds that they'd tried to seduce everyone's husbands
00:43:57,00:44:02,So I think the first woman who eventually went out with the British Antarctic survey Janet Thompson
00:44:02,00:44:09,She had to go around and properly meet and talk to all the wives of the teammates that she'd be going with to convince them
00:44:09,00:44:13,That she was an actual scientist and not just going out to seduce all of their husbands
00:44:13,00:44:20,Which huge effort to go to there was another quote from the British Antarctic survey a few years later
00:44:20,00:44:25,I think which when a bunch of women applied to go to Antarctica and were turned down
00:44:25,00:44:31,They were turned down on the grounds that there are no facilities for women in the Antarctic. No shops. No hairdressers
00:44:31,00:44:33,Wow
00:44:33,00:44:39,"And even like these days there are more men there, but the you know, it's getting more and more level"
00:44:39,00:44:43,I think the US Antarctic program is about 60 to 65 percent men
00:44:44,00:44:50,But in the 1980s they had there was so many men there and so few women that they had something called the cysteine ceiling
00:44:50,00:44:56,"In weddle hut in Antarctica, which was basically the ceiling of this whole hut was covered in"
00:44:56,00:44:59,naked pornographic pictures of women and
00:44:59,00:45:08,In the 1980s there was an attempt by some Australians to turn that ceiling into an australian national heritage site of high significance
00:45:08,00:45:16,"Right, so what do you mean they kept it as it is? They wanted to put it back as it was and um, you know have it as some special"
00:45:16,00:45:22,site it was protected. So it's a bit of a mystery that they're so important to have a visual stimulus
00:45:22,00:45:26,That you have to have the image in front of you. Yeah
00:45:26,00:45:33,But you can't just can't just picture somebody naked in your head. Some people I just can't think of anyone
00:45:33,00:45:36,"I'm going to have to look at the actual photograph. Oh, there's one. Yes"
00:45:37,00:45:40,Some people can't picture things in their head. I can't picture things in my head
00:45:40,00:45:42,"Yeah, and that's why your ceiling is covered in porn, isn't it?"
00:45:42,00:45:47,As we say the pinnacle of human evidence
00:45:47,00:45:50,I keep pointing them out to my cat. She's not interested. No
00:45:50,00:45:54,"No, there's a load of wheels lying on their backs on the floor"
00:45:54,00:46:05,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is my fact"
00:46:06,00:46:12,My fact this week is that in 1990 a british airways flight landed with one pilot in the cockpit and the other
00:46:12,00:46:15,Hanging by his legs outside the front window
00:46:15,00:46:19,It's an extraordinary story. So this was a british flight
00:46:19,00:46:27,"5 3 9 0 it left birmingham and it was heading for malaga in spain and um, they were just under 15 minutes into their flight"
00:46:27,00:46:33,"They were cruising at 17,300 feet over oxfordshire when suddenly there was this huge loud bang in the cockpit"
00:46:33,00:46:38,The window on the pilot side on the left hand side suddenly flung away from the plane and
00:46:38,00:46:43,Exposed the plane to all the air on the outside and the decompression was so great
00:46:43,00:46:49,That the door that blocks off the pilots from the rest of the plane got ripped off its hinges
00:46:49,00:46:56,Straight into the control panel as well as the pilot who got ripped out of the window of the plane
00:46:56,00:47:00,And only didn't disappear because his legs got caught on the control panel
00:47:00,00:47:05,so he was just being whack back and forth on the plane on the outside and um
00:47:05,00:47:11,"The story goes that there was a first officer who came in to see if they needed refreshments, which i don't quite believe i think"
00:47:11,00:47:16,When the doors ripped off and the plane is sent into a descent
00:47:16,00:47:24,"Um, he comes in anyway. He sees the pilot outside the front window and quickly runs and grabs his legs and has to hold him"
00:47:24,00:47:28,And the story ends with them having to make an emergency landing
00:47:28,00:47:33,They spend 22 minutes from the moment that it happens to landing and they successfully land
00:47:33,00:47:36,"And um, he's alive. It's an extraordinary survival story"
00:47:36,00:47:43,But that's the other brilliant bit about this story that i like was two things one was that the flight attendants were taking interns to hang on to
00:47:43,00:47:49,Because it was really exhausting and freezing cold and there was no the air was thin
00:47:49,00:47:54,There were and they but also that they thought he was dead. They thought they were hanging on
00:47:54,00:47:59,They thought they were hanging on to a dead person and the reason that they kept hanging on
00:47:59,00:48:02,Was because they were worried that if they let go
00:48:02,00:48:05,He might get sucked into the engine
00:48:05,00:48:13,"Oh, take the whole plane down potentially. Oh my days. So they were he was unconscious, right? He lost consciousness"
00:48:13,00:48:19,So it's only when they landed and they kind of i don't know how delicately they dragged him back into the witness
00:48:20,00:48:28,But believing as they did that he was dead often if they put that point they then just dropped him out the window and he'd landed on the runway
00:48:28,00:48:33,That might have killed him but to their amazement
00:48:33,00:48:38,"He was alive and rushed to hospital. Wow, and that's good. I hope they never told him"
00:48:38,00:48:43,"I hope he woke up and said god. Thank you so much for saving my life and they didn't say no, mate"
00:48:43,00:48:45,We were just trying to stop you fucking up the engine
00:48:47,00:48:54,It is extraordinary pretty incredible when the guy the one of the flight attendants got frostbite in his eye
00:48:54,00:49:01,"Wow and suffered per PTSD, but they there's such a suction that they they think that he's"
00:49:01,00:49:05,The equivalent weight of 500 pounds they were hanging on to
00:49:05,00:49:07,so really terrific
00:49:07,00:49:13,Feet of endurance and strength to save this guy or really it's bizarre story
00:49:14,00:49:20,"What is that that's about the weight of sort of four people, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Well, well two large blocks"
00:49:20,00:49:25,It's fake it's like two greg davis
00:49:25,00:49:31,And seeing it all I mean it's kind of amazing that the passengers got to see everything
00:49:31,00:49:36,"Yeah, I think that's that's a real perk for the anecdote purposes once you're back on earth"
00:49:36,00:49:39,"So the door blew off. Oh, would you rather not know what was happening? Maybe"
00:49:39,00:49:43,"Certainly at the time you'd rather think everything was fine and handy, but"
00:49:43,00:49:45,"Yeah, then you get two weeks in Southampton"
00:49:45,00:49:50,"Um, what I found amazing is that in 2018 this happened again"
00:49:50,00:49:55,So there was a there was a Sichuan Airlines plane
00:49:55,00:50:01,Going to Tibet and there was again the windscreen went and the pilot got sucked out
00:50:01,00:50:07,And the co-pilot said I looked over to my side and half of my co-pilot's body was hanging out of the window
00:50:07,00:50:10,"Fortunately, he was wearing a seatbelt"
00:50:10,00:50:15,So they only got halfway out and they managed to pull him back in
00:50:15,00:50:20,But that apparently it's a thing that happens. That is an advert for seatbelts if you ever get into one
00:50:20,00:50:23,I don't ever take your seatbelt off in a plane
00:50:23,00:50:30,"Really, because if it's like something does go wrong, it's not by chance. So I'll probably be all right anyway"
00:50:30,00:50:33,"No, you'll definitely go out the window"
00:50:33,00:50:36,It's nothing gonna say
00:50:36,00:50:40,We should say so the reason that this happened was because the windscreen itself had been
00:50:40,00:50:45,Refitted to the plane the night before and the wrong bolts had been used to secure it
00:50:45,00:50:47,So they were half a millimeter too small
00:50:47,00:50:52,And so it just couldn't handle the intense air pressure once it was up there and that's why it blew out
00:50:52,00:50:57,So since then they've changed it so that they've stopped bolting them out a from the outside
00:50:57,00:51:01,"They now do it from the inside which um, it just apparently is a bit more helpful"
00:51:01,00:51:07,"And uh, they make sure to use the proper bolts. This is just for anyone who's currently on the plane listening to us"
00:51:08,00:51:10,It's not going to happen again. Don't worry
00:51:10,00:51:14,"Okay, good to know they're making sure to use the proper bolts. How"
00:51:14,00:51:20,"I mean, it's amazing the stuff that can go wrong. There was this 1983"
00:51:20,00:51:22,Canada flight
00:51:22,00:51:26,Where the pilots have to check that so you check the fuel levels before you take off
00:51:26,00:51:29,so you know how much fuel to put in the tank for your journey
00:51:29,00:51:33,And they were a bit understaffed so the pilots had to do the checking themselves and they did it
00:51:33,00:51:36,The electronic system was broken. So they had to use a dipstick
00:51:36,00:51:39,So they just dip the dipstick into the fuel tank pulled it out
00:51:39,00:51:42,You've got to figure out the volume from that and then from that
00:51:42,00:51:48,They have to do the calculations to figure out the mass of fuel so they know how much to add and to add an extra complication
00:51:48,00:51:51,They just switched to the metric system
00:51:51,00:51:54,Which confused them so they used the wrong calculation
00:51:54,00:51:58,They used a calculation as if they were converting to pounds rather than kilos
00:51:58,00:52:04,Which given that 2.2 pounds is one kilogram meant they ended up with just under half the amount of fuel they needed
00:52:04,00:52:09,And because their systems are broken they didn't get a warning until the plane engine just completely cut off
00:52:09,00:52:15,And they started plummeting out the sky and fortunately the captain was an experienced glider pilot
00:52:15,00:52:18,Which always comes in handy and so he glid them down
00:52:18,00:52:23,Just about to safety although he did break the nose off the plane
00:52:23,00:52:28,But it's quite confusing was that pilot hero or was he a moron?
00:52:28,00:52:31,"I mean, he did cock up the calculations. Yeah"
00:52:32,00:52:38,"It's interesting, isn't it that planes they can glide down can't they really in theory a"
00:52:38,00:52:42,An aeroplane is designed so that even if both of the engines go it can
00:52:42,00:52:48,Glide for quite a long time and actually the chance of surviving depends on how high you are because
00:52:48,00:52:53,Obviously the higher you are the further you can get and the easier it is to get to an actual airport
00:52:53,00:53:00,And apparently I was talking to my wife about this who is a helicopter pilot as you guys know and I was asking her like
00:53:01,00:53:03,If we were flying in a helicopter and she collapsed
00:53:03,00:53:10,Would I be able to land the helicopter and she reckons that there's about a 50-50 chance that I would be able to do it
00:53:10,00:53:14,"No way and survive. That's what she reckons. I reckon. Yeah, it seems a lot"
00:53:14,00:53:17,She buys into this whole thing about your family being the peak of evil
00:53:17,00:53:23,She thinks you're an actual genius. She thinks I could jump out and just fly down. But no
00:53:23,00:53:29,James when you say she collapses is she still telling you what to do or are you just taking control?
00:53:29,00:53:33,She said that the main problem first of all would be throwing her body out of the helicopter
00:53:33,00:53:37,And getting the controls before it went out of control. But if I managed to do that
00:53:37,00:53:41,She why do you need to throw the body out? What if that it's that pilot situation again?
00:53:41,00:53:47,"And she's just fallen unconscious. It's quite small helicopter and you know, I just want to look we want to stretch out"
00:53:47,00:53:49,I want to stretch my arms
00:53:49,00:53:57,I got to say the the 50% side of you surviving kind of makes you a dick if you do survive
00:53:58,00:54:01,There's a lot of unfortunate things you need to do to survive there
00:54:01,00:54:06,Apparently I wouldn't be able to hover by be able to probably make quite a hard landing
00:54:06,00:54:11,"That's a crash, right? That's a crash"
00:54:11,00:54:17,"It's a crash, but the survival would be the survival would be approximately 50% but I don't know"
00:54:17,00:54:21,"That's what she says. Um, I had a quite my favorite plane based story from the year"
00:54:21,00:54:25,"Is one that I read about a couple of months ago, but it's that"
00:54:25,00:54:31,A there was a french businessman 64 years old and his colleagues got him a present
00:54:31,00:54:36,And they got him like an experience present and what they got him was a flight on a fighter jet
00:54:36,00:54:39,And this was in spite of the fact as he said afterwards
00:54:39,00:54:43,He'd never expressed any interest at all in planes or fighter jets or desire to go in one
00:54:43,00:54:49,So they got him this flight in this amazing fighter jet and he it took off and he felt really unstable
00:54:49,00:54:52,He said he sort of flew off his seat as it took off because you know g-force and everything
00:54:53,00:54:56,And he grabbed at the nearest lever to try and stabilize himself
00:54:56,00:54:59,And what that lever was was the ejection mechanism
00:54:59,00:55:05,And so he accidentally ejected himself from the plane. So the roof flies at the plane
00:55:05,00:55:11,He flies out of the plane and had to surprise parachute land into a field and be taken
00:55:11,00:55:17,"Immediately to hospital where he was absolutely fine, but resentful of his colleagues"
00:55:17,00:55:22,"So funny, I think the ejection mechanism shouldn't be that accessible"
00:55:23,00:55:25,"Well, you do need it if you're kind of"
00:55:25,00:55:29,Imagine if it wasn't accessible and you did actually want to leave the plane
00:55:29,00:55:34,"Yeah, and then you have to you have to solve a rubik's cube just to get out of the plane or something"
00:55:34,00:55:39,"Yeah, my first is in lemon but not"
00:55:39,00:55:46,"Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts"
00:55:46,00:55:47,Thank you so much for listening
