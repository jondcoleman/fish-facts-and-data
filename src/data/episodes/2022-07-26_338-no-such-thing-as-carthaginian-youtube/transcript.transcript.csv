00:00:00,00:00:04,"Hi everyone, James here. Now, before we start this week's show, just a couple of bits of business,"
00:00:04,00:00:10,"first of all, this episode was recorded while Anna was still away and so her place has been taken"
00:00:10,00:00:18,"by one of my oldest friends, the absolute genius that is Jenny Ryan. Now, if you're a fan of quiz"
00:00:18,00:00:24,"shows, you would know her as the vixen of The Chase. If you're a fan of singing talent shows,"
00:00:24,00:00:29,you might remember her from Celebrity X Factor last year where she got to the final.
00:00:29,00:00:35,"If you're a fan of podcasts, which I know you are, you might know her from Fingers on Buzzers,"
00:00:35,00:00:40,"the brilliant quiz-based podcast that Jenny does with comedian Lucy Porter. And actually,"
00:00:40,00:00:46,"if you go into the back catalogue of Fingers on Buzzers, you might find an old episode with myself"
00:00:46,00:00:52,"and Anna Tyshinsky on, if you are missing her so much that you really need to hear her dulcet tones."
00:00:52,00:01:09,"Okay, on with the podcast."
00:01:09,00:01:14,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:01:14,00:01:19,from four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting here
00:01:19,00:01:25,"with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin and special guest Jenny Ryan. And once again,"
00:01:25,00:01:29,we have gathered round our microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:01:29,00:01:34,"And in a particular order, here we go. Starting with you, Jenny."
00:01:34,00:01:40,Here we go. Trigger warning for grossness. One theory of the origin of the nursery rhyme
00:01:40,00:01:47,Pussycat Pussycat is that it's a reference to Queen Anne's poor personal hygiene and an accumulation
00:01:47,00:01:52,of grime that once fell out of a skirt during a service at St Paul's Cathedral.
00:01:52,00:01:59,"Wow. Wow. Okay. Where to start with that one? Okay, well, let's start with the with the actual"
00:01:59,00:02:04,"nursery rhyme because not everyone might know it, right? So how's it go? Andy, why don't you regale"
00:02:04,00:02:09,"us with that? Oh, it's Pussycat Pussycat. Where have you been? I've been up to London to look at"
00:02:09,00:02:16,the Queen followed by loads more lines. There is more. Pussycat Pussycat. What did you there?
00:02:16,00:02:20,I've chased a little mouse under her chair or I've frightened a little mouse under her chair.
00:02:20,00:02:23,"That's actually the important bit now, I think. That is the important bit. Yeah, yeah."
00:02:23,00:02:33,So it's thought that little mouse is a mouse shaped deposit of all sorts of things that
00:02:33,00:02:41,"might accumulate in a time when nobody really had a bath or washed their nethers. So supposedly,"
00:02:42,00:02:50,"this particular lump was known as a suttikin, although that may be a more modern name for them"
00:02:50,00:02:57,because they resembled little mice and people would have to go and sweep them up off the streets.
00:02:57,00:03:02,"Wait, hang on. Are you saying that the TV series Suttie and Sweep has anything to do with this?"
00:03:02,00:03:04,No.
00:03:04,00:03:09,"Thank goodness. Okay, great. Well, my childhood is intact. I will. I'll link them up somehow,"
00:03:09,00:03:17,right? So the word suttikins does exist. It comes from the Dutch. It was kind of a joke
00:03:17,00:03:25,"about Dutch women. Supposedly, they would put heaters up their dresses to keep warm. And some"
00:03:25,00:03:30,"people thought that by doing so, they were breeding a small animal up there and that the animal would"
00:03:30,00:03:37,kind of drop out and they would find this thing. And the word came from the word sutt. It's similar
00:03:37,00:03:43,"to the word sutt, as in the stuff you get in of chimney. And of course, Suttie and Sweep is a pun"
00:03:43,00:03:48,"on the fact that chimney sweeps would also find sutt. So they are linked in a way, Andy, if that's"
00:03:48,00:03:52,"what you think. Oh, great. Okay. No, my childhood is ruined. Thank you very much. Yeah, brilliant."
00:03:52,00:03:58,What kind of person was running so low on inspiration for nursery rhymes that when they saw
00:03:58,00:04:04,"a mess-shaped mouse fall out of the Queens, that they thought this is perfect for kids?"
00:04:04,00:04:11,"Well, I think what we should say is the most explanations for nursery rhymes are speculative"
00:04:11,00:04:17,at best. And there was a couple called Iona and Peter Opie who wrote the Oxford Dictionary of
00:04:17,00:04:22,Nursery Rhymes. And they basically came to the conclusion that all of these things that people
00:04:22,00:04:30,think probably not true and also that they might just be kind of nice words that kind of sound
00:04:30,00:04:35,like a good poem and there might not be any reasoning behind them all. So whether that's
00:04:35,00:04:39,"true or whether it's not, I don't know. But the other thing is that Queen Anne had quite a lot"
00:04:39,00:04:46,"of enemies, right? So it's possible that if this is true, this origin, that it was people trying to"
00:04:46,00:04:51,"say bad things about her and you know that. Oh yeah, it was basically gossip, wasn't it? The nursery"
00:04:51,00:04:56,rhymes you've had a way of spreading anything is to make it into a little folk song and get it
00:04:56,00:05:01,"spreading around the streets of London. Weirdly, this is not the only nursery rhyme that Queen Anne"
00:05:01,00:05:07,"is supposedly involved with. Really? Yeah, there's another one. Okay, so do you remember the Warming"
00:05:07,00:05:15,"Pan, baby? Nope. So Anne, when she wasn't Queen yet, she was in line to the throne and so was her"
00:05:15,00:05:25,"older sister, Mary. And their dad was James II, who was King. And in 1688, James II had a son,"
00:05:25,00:05:30,"a baby boy, with his new wife, which displaced Mary and Anne from the line of succession. So"
00:05:30,00:05:35,they were kind of lowered down the rung now. And Anne was furious about this. She refused to attend
00:05:35,00:05:43,"the birth. And there was a rumour spread that the baby had not been born alive, a miscarriage,"
00:05:43,00:05:48,"and actually a live baby had been smuggled into the bedroom in a warming pan, which were these"
00:05:48,00:05:54,"big brass pans that you would put hot coals into warm up the bed. Right, that's the story."
00:05:54,00:06:04,"Okay. Is that also untrue? But we might get the nursery rhyme, rocker by baby, from that child."
00:06:04,00:06:09,Really? Yeah. And what's the explanation behind it? It's incredibly furious. Okay.
00:06:09,00:06:17,"That thing about how you thought that someone might swap the baby, isn't that why, and I'm going"
00:06:17,00:06:22,"to get this wrong, but isn't the home secretary supposed to be at every birth? Is it the home"
00:06:22,00:06:29,"secretary? Every royal birth, not every birth. It might not be the home secretary. No, it is,"
00:06:29,00:06:35,"it is. It is the home secretary, yeah. Who's the current home secretary? Pretty Patel. Oh, man."
00:06:35,00:06:40,"Imagine if she had to go around to every single birth in the country. But she would be saying,"
00:06:40,00:06:44,"""Get back in there. Get back in there. Don't want you. Don't want you. Go on. Back up, you go."""
00:06:46,00:06:50,I love that idea that you would sort of shame people in history via children telling rhymes.
00:06:50,00:06:56,We don't do that so much these days. That would be an incredible satirical kids program where it's
00:06:56,00:07:02,just us shaming politicians and so on with new songs that we put out. There was a nursery rhyme
00:07:02,00:07:09,"when I was a kid, which was called Maggie Thatcher sticker in the bin. So in a way, it still does"
00:07:09,00:07:13,"continue that there will be, they'll probably sing Boris Johnson's sticker in the bin now."
00:07:13,00:07:20,"It'll be any Prime Minister. Maggie Thatcher sticker in the bin, put the lid on, sell the"
00:07:20,00:07:26,"tape her in. And I remember when she actually resigned as Prime Minister, they came in and"
00:07:26,00:07:31,"told us in the classroom, and we all sang it. Really? Wow. We think we're about eight."
00:07:31,00:07:38,"We had also Maggie Thatcher, Milk Snatcher kind of a little rhyme about that, didn't we?"
00:07:38,00:07:42,"Yeah. Hey, just very quickly for international listeners, and I included myself slightly in"
00:07:42,00:07:48,"this because I'm not O.F.A. with the British monarchy's history, but Queen Anne was a queen"
00:07:48,00:07:54,"from her birthday, it was 1665 to 1714. And there's not really been much about her. She's not"
00:07:54,00:08:00,"one of the more popular people for pop culture, except for the fact that she had the movie The"
00:08:00,00:08:04,"Favourite, which was a fairly recent one, which Olivia Coleman won the Oscar for the portrayal"
00:08:04,00:08:09,"of her. But outside of that, she kind of slips through the cracks a bit in terms of people's"
00:08:09,00:08:15,knowledge about her. And the only stuff that really comes through is all this quite shaming
00:08:15,00:08:21,"sort of information about her, people attacking her for her looks and her hygiene and all the"
00:08:21,00:08:29,"accounts of her body size and so on. It was claimed that when she passed away, 14 men had to carry her"
00:08:29,00:08:33,for her burial. And I don't know if this stuff is true. I don't know if this is part of the
00:08:33,00:08:38,"shaming of her, but that's kind of what we know about her. It's 100% true that she did have health"
00:08:38,00:08:45,problems and that she was definitely a large lady. She had a lot of gout. She really struggled with
00:08:45,00:08:53,"that. But there was definitely also a lot of... She had a lot of enemies. For instance, this thing"
00:08:53,00:08:59,"at St. Paul's Cathedral, it was a Thanksgiving ceremony after the war. They just finished a war"
00:08:59,00:09:04,"with either France or Spain. Spanish succession, wasn't it? Spanish succession. Yeah, I trust you"
00:09:04,00:09:09,"to know that, Jen. I'll probably just throw out some half-remembered facts and then you can just"
00:09:09,00:09:16,"fill in the gaps today, maybe. But they built stands along the side of the Strand and they had"
00:09:16,00:09:22,"4,000 children singing patriotic songs while they walked down to St. Paul's Cathedral. But a lot of"
00:09:22,00:09:26,people weren't really happy with it because they thought that Queen Anne was secretly trying to get
00:09:26,00:09:32,the Jacobites back onto the English throne and that she was kind of slightly sympathetic to the
00:09:32,00:09:40,Catholics. It was a real kind of time where the monarchy was losing a lot of its power and Parliament
00:09:40,00:09:44,was kind of coming in. I think that's why we don't hear much about her. It got called the Age of
00:09:44,00:09:50,"Party. Wow, that sounds cool. Well, yeah, it was... Unfortunately, it was the Age of the Wigs and"
00:09:50,00:09:56,"the Tories, as opposed to everyone having a good time. I was thinking it was Gatsby style."
00:09:56,00:10:01,"Poor time travellers who read that said, ""Let's go over there."""
00:10:01,00:10:04,Everybody stank and there were no parties.
00:10:04,00:10:13,"Nursery rhymes. Yeah, let's do it. Okay. There always seems to be,"
00:10:13,00:10:20,"James has mentioned, there's a lot of debunked stories about the origins of nursery rhymes."
00:10:20,00:10:26,And I'm sure that some of them have been retconned into the nursery rhymes themselves.
00:10:26,00:10:31,"The Grand Old Duke of York is clearly about a failed military campaign, but there is about a"
00:10:31,00:10:39,"dozen different ideas of who it's talking about. Who's the current Duke of York? Oh, I don't remember."
00:10:39,00:10:48,"Anyway, Pop Goes the Weasel. I really like that one. I love Pop Goes the Weasel."
00:10:48,00:10:50,That one actually is about Prince Andrew. Yeah.
00:10:50,00:10:57,"No one really knows what it means, what Pop Goes the Weasel is."
00:10:57,00:11:01,"There's a lot of copy rhyming slang in there, though, and references to the city road and"
00:11:01,00:11:05,"the eagle on the city road, which is actually still there, the pub."
00:11:05,00:11:10,"It is, and it has like a side on the side of the building, doesn't it, with the nursery rhyme on it."
00:11:10,00:11:16,"But yeah, so weasel could be your weasel and stout, your throat. So it's like, ""Get it down,"
00:11:16,00:11:21,"your weasel, mate, when you give someone a pint of beer. Get it down your weasel."""
00:11:21,00:11:26,Or your weasel could be a coat. So there's an idea that it's about putting your coat into the
00:11:26,00:11:34,"pawn shop to pay off all your debts. And any time a new expense comes in, Pop Goes the Weasel,"
00:11:34,00:11:40,"there goes your coat again. So yeah, it's a really good cockney knees up."
00:11:40,00:11:45,"But what I really like about it is in the 1850s, it was like a dance craze,"
00:11:45,00:11:50,Pop Goes the Weasel. So if you were a time traveller and you wanted to find a real good
00:11:50,00:11:55,"party, then you want to go to 1850s London because you're going to know the dance."
00:11:55,00:11:59,You're going to absolutely smash it. You can go into your music hall and you just dance around.
00:11:59,00:12:03,"And then at the end of it, everyone shouts out, ""Pop Goes the Weasel!"""
00:12:03,00:12:08,And that's kind of the big sort of ending of every verse. And it was absolutely massive.
00:12:08,00:12:11,The baby shark of its day.
00:12:11,00:12:12,So adults were doing this?
00:12:12,00:12:18,"Adults were doing it, yeah. There was an advertisement in the Bath Chronicle in 1853"
00:12:18,00:12:23,that offered instruction to the highly fashionable dance of Pop Goes the Weasel.
00:12:23,00:12:28,So you could pay people to teach you how to do the Pop Goes the Weasel dance.
00:12:28,00:12:33,"And even then, no one really knew what it meant. It was just like a nonsense phrase, really."
00:12:33,00:12:37,"But yeah, it's just like us loving the Macarena. I don't know what the hell that means,"
00:12:37,00:12:43,but it's a dancer. I haven't dedicated myself to understanding the lyrics.
00:12:43,00:12:45,I think it's about a lady called Macarena.
00:12:45,00:12:49,It's about a lady whose husband has gone away and she's
00:12:49,00:12:54,courting all the other local boys because her boyfriend isn't there anymore.
00:12:54,00:12:59,"500 years from now, people will be saying, ""Actually, the Macarena is about..."""
00:12:59,00:13:00,"Actually, it's about Brexit."
00:13:04,00:13:08,"I love it. Do you guys remember the one that goes, ""Do your ears hang low?"
00:13:08,00:13:10,"Do they wobble too and throw back kids' song?"""
00:13:10,00:13:13,"We said, ""Can you tie them in a bow?"" I think."
00:13:13,00:13:14,"Yeah, ""Can you tie them in a..."""
00:13:14,00:13:17,"And actually, I think it was, ""Do your boobs hang low? Do your ears hang low?"""
00:13:17,00:13:19,"Well, I think it's, ""Do your balls hang low?"""
00:13:19,00:13:23,"""Do your balls and do your boobs are the sort of the rude versions of it."""
00:13:23,00:13:27,"But the assumption is that it was the kids' song, ""Do your ears hang low?"""
00:13:27,00:13:30,"And then when you got sort of rude kids at school going,"
00:13:30,00:13:31,"""Have you heard this version?"" You would sing it."
00:13:31,00:13:34,"Anyway, it turns out that the original versions were,"
00:13:34,00:13:36,"""Do your balls hang low and do your boobs hang low?"""
00:13:36,00:13:40,"And then it got sort of turned into a more presentable for kids,"
00:13:40,00:13:41,"""Do your ears hang low?"""
00:13:41,00:13:44,So it was sung in wartime during World War I on the Western Front.
00:13:44,00:13:48,"They would be singing it in the trenches, ""Do your balls hang low?"""
00:13:48,00:13:51,"And then, ""Do the sailor's hornpipe."" Yeah."
00:13:51,00:13:53,"Right. ""Do your balls hang low? Can you swing them through?"
00:13:53,00:13:55,Can you tie them in a knot? Can you tie them in a bow?
00:13:55,00:13:58,"Can you tuck them to the ceiling with that free and easy feeling?"""
00:13:58,00:14:03,"Anyway, it goes, ""That's amazing."""
00:14:03,00:14:06,It's true. I've never heard that version. I don't think so.
00:14:06,00:14:09,That's the only one. I like that one as a child. Yeah?
00:14:09,00:14:11,"These things just stay with you, don't they?"
00:14:11,00:14:14,"Along with, you know, Margaret Thatcher, ""She's our hero."""
00:14:14,00:14:20,Okay. We went to very different schools.
00:14:20,00:14:23,Gave everyone in the classroom a black armband when she resigned.
00:14:26,00:14:29,Have you heard of telltale tit? This is a really short one.
00:14:29,00:14:31,"Telltale tit, ""Your tongue shall be slit,"
00:14:31,00:14:34,"and all the dogs in the town shall have a little bit."""
00:14:34,00:14:37,"So I'd never heard that before, but it's very common in Bolton, I can say."
00:14:37,00:14:40,Yeah. All the dogs in Bolton will have a little bit.
00:14:40,00:14:42,But I just think that's amazing.
00:14:42,00:14:44,It's because it's basically a children's equivalent
00:14:44,00:14:46,of saying snitches get stitches. Yeah.
00:14:46,00:14:49,"Yeah? Telltale tit, ""Your tongue will split,"
00:14:49,00:14:51,"and all the little doggies will have a little bit."""
00:14:51,00:14:53,That's what it used to say. It's terrifying.
00:14:53,00:14:55,Do you guys know Pissabed? No.
00:14:55,00:15:01,"It goes, ""Pissabed, Pissabed, Barley, but your bum is so heavy, you can't get up."""
00:15:01,00:15:09,And this was published in the very first nursery rhyme songbook
00:15:09,00:15:12,that was printed in Britain in 1744.
00:15:12,00:15:16,It's the first time that Ba Ba Blacksheep was ever printed in a nursery rhyme book.
00:15:16,00:15:18,So it was called Tommy Thumb's Pretty Songbook.
00:15:18,00:15:22,"And we thought there was only one copy that was left,"
00:15:22,00:15:25,"which was held, I think, in the British Library."
00:15:25,00:15:27,But one went up for auction a few years ago.
00:15:27,00:15:30,So there might be a couple more out there.
00:15:30,00:15:32,But it had 40 nursery rhymes in it.
00:15:32,00:15:35,"And all the classics, Ba Ba Blacksheep, Hickory Dickory Dock,"
00:15:35,00:15:38,"London Bridge is Falling Down, Mary Mary's Quite Contrary."
00:15:38,00:15:39,"This thing, a song with six pence."
00:15:39,00:15:41,And then Pissabed.
00:15:41,00:15:42,Tommy Thumb's Pretty Songbook.
00:15:42,00:15:44,"They were actually all about Pretty Patel, weren't they?"
00:15:44,00:15:53,That's where that name came from.
00:15:53,00:15:56,"OK, it is time for fact number two."
00:15:56,00:15:57,And that is Andy.
00:15:57,00:16:02,"My fact is that in 1862, there was a special cravat invented"
00:16:02,00:16:04,to stop people strangling you in the street.
00:16:04,00:16:12,"So if I went to strangle you, Andy, with this, my hands go for your neck."
00:16:13,00:16:16,"Is it that the cravat is so full of folds and so on,"
00:16:16,00:16:18,I can never actually find your neck?
00:16:18,00:16:19,How does it work?
00:16:19,00:16:21,"It's a real pencil neck, yeah."
00:16:21,00:16:23,"No, it's got spikes on the inside."
00:16:23,00:16:24,So you could go for the neck.
00:16:24,00:16:24,On the inside?
00:16:24,00:16:26,But you get a pretty nasty--
00:16:26,00:16:26,"Oh, sorry."
00:16:26,00:16:31,The spikes are on the outside.
00:16:31,00:16:32,"Oh, right, OK."
00:16:32,00:16:33,Concealed by a layer of cloth.
00:16:33,00:16:35,Don't put that on the wrong way round.
00:16:35,00:16:40,"No, you're right."
00:16:40,00:16:40,"You're right, you're right."
00:16:40,00:16:41,"Sorry, they're on the outside."
00:16:41,00:16:44,But they're cleverly concealed by the ruffles at the front of the cravat.
00:16:44,00:16:49,"And so Dan, as soon as you probably try and put your thumbs around my windpipe,"
00:16:49,00:16:51,"nice try mate, you're going to get a spiky thumb."
00:16:51,00:16:57,I also read that some of them had razor blades sewn into the folds as well.
00:16:57,00:17:01,"Yeah, pretty intense items of clothing."
00:17:01,00:17:06,"And these were designed to fight the menace of garrottings,"
00:17:06,00:17:07,because there was a panic.
00:17:07,00:17:12,"In fact, there were two panics in the mid-19th century about garrottings."
00:17:12,00:17:17,"One in 1856, and then it sort of flared up again in 1862."
00:17:17,00:17:22,And there was this massive panic about actually a relatively small crime wave
00:17:22,00:17:23,of people being mugged.
00:17:23,00:17:28,"And the method of mugging was someone would grab someone around the throat,"
00:17:28,00:17:30,and then their accomplice would rob them.
00:17:30,00:17:31,And--
00:17:31,00:17:36,"Yeah, I should just say, like a garrotting to me is like you get some cheese wire or something,"
00:17:36,00:17:40,"like in a movie, they would get some wire and they would put it around your throat."
00:17:40,00:17:42,But this was actually more like putting someone in a sleeper hold
00:17:42,00:17:44,"in like a wrestling move, wasn't it, than--"
00:17:44,00:17:46,"Yeah, yeah."
00:17:46,00:17:48,"I mean, it could definitely, it could hurt you very badly."
00:17:48,00:17:50,"I mean, it could absolutely, it could kill you as well."
00:17:50,00:17:55,I don't think very many people at all were actually killed by this.
00:17:55,00:17:58,But it led to a change in the law.
00:17:58,00:18:01,The parliament passed the 1863 Garottas Act.
00:18:01,00:18:04,"And yeah, this was a big panic."
00:18:04,00:18:08,"There is an argument that not only did not many people die of this,"
00:18:08,00:18:09,no people died of it.
00:18:09,00:18:11,And it was completely made up.
00:18:11,00:18:12,"Yeah, absolutely."
00:18:12,00:18:14,So there's an argument that it was completely made up by newspapers.
00:18:14,00:18:16,So there was an MP who got mugged.
00:18:16,00:18:19,"He was called Hugh Pilkington, and he had his pocket watch stolen."
00:18:19,00:18:24,And they said that he was garrotted when they stole his watch.
00:18:24,00:18:27,"But actually, it seems like he wasn't really."
00:18:27,00:18:31,"And then basically, newspapers started calling any minor instant."
00:18:31,00:18:32,"They said, oh, this was a garrotting."
00:18:33,00:18:37,"And then some of the magistrates would say that it was a garrotting,"
00:18:37,00:18:40,"even though it wasn't, because they knew that the person would get more time"
00:18:40,00:18:42,or a stronger punishment for it.
00:18:42,00:18:48,"And then after the 1863 Act, there was no more garrottings."
00:18:48,00:18:50,"But the argument among historians, a lot of them,"
00:18:50,00:18:52,is that there were never any in the first place.
00:18:52,00:18:56,"It's very much what's it in the Simpsons,"
00:18:56,00:19:00,where it's like this rock scares away tigers or whatever it is.
00:19:00,00:19:01,"Yeah, right."
00:19:01,00:19:02,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:19:02,00:19:04,But there were descriptions of how it worked.
00:19:04,00:19:06,"So it would be a three-person gang,"
00:19:06,00:19:11,"which consisted of a front stall, a back stall, and the nasty man."
00:19:11,00:19:12,"OK, so."
00:19:12,00:19:15,Tag yourself.
00:19:15,00:19:21,I think the front stall distracts you.
00:19:21,00:19:23,"He stops you and says, oh, excuse me, do you have the time."
00:19:23,00:19:25,"And then the back stall is the lookout,"
00:19:25,00:19:27,who's making sure there are no police coming along.
00:19:27,00:19:30,And the nasty man is the one who actually does the garrotting.
00:19:31,00:19:32,I could have worked that out.
00:19:32,00:19:33,"Oh, OK."
00:19:33,00:19:39,"There was another thing you could buy in 1858,"
00:19:39,00:19:43,"a guy called Henry Boll invented a pistol one on your back,"
00:19:43,00:19:45,which would discharge into a criminal's crotch.
00:19:45,00:19:47,I love this.
00:19:47,00:19:50,"That would go, I suppose that would go for the back man, would it?"
00:19:50,00:19:53,"Oh, yeah, that would be to take the back stall."
00:19:53,00:19:54,Yeah.
00:19:54,00:19:54,Yeah.
00:19:54,00:19:58,"Well, no, the grotter is going around you with the sleepball, right?"
00:19:58,00:19:58,"Oh, good point."
00:19:58,00:20:00,So that's for the nasty man here.
00:20:00,00:20:01,"Yeah, that's nasty man."
00:20:02,00:20:02,Wow.
00:20:02,00:20:04,I think I can't believe this was a real thing.
00:20:04,00:20:05,Did that work?
00:20:05,00:20:06,Did anyone?
00:20:06,00:20:08,I'm not sure any of this stuff was.
00:20:08,00:20:10,"No, this is a real thing."
00:20:10,00:20:11,"It was real, sorry."
00:20:11,00:20:14,"It was real, but I don't think everyone was wearing them."
00:20:14,00:20:15,"You know, it was kind of."
00:20:15,00:20:15,Right.
00:20:15,00:20:17,Wow.
00:20:17,00:20:20,"Imagine that you're going out just to the local pub,"
00:20:20,00:20:21,"you're wearing spikes around your neck,"
00:20:21,00:20:23,you've got a pistol facing backwards.
00:20:23,00:20:26,"I mean, Jesus, what a look."
00:20:26,00:20:27,"This gun sounds amazing,"
00:20:27,00:20:29,"because it looks just like a little belt pack, doesn't it?"
00:20:29,00:20:31,"And you, but the thing is, obviously,"
00:20:31,00:20:33,you had guns weren't that advanced yet.
00:20:33,00:20:37,So apparently you had to reach back to cock the hammer of the gun.
00:20:37,00:20:41,"And then you had to kind of pull a ripcord at your waistline,"
00:20:41,00:20:44,which would actually fire the gun and fire a lead ball into your attackers.
00:20:44,00:20:46,It would be recoil.
00:20:46,00:20:48,"Like normally recoil goes in one direction,"
00:20:48,00:20:49,"but if it's firing there,"
00:20:49,00:20:51,"you would just be kind of thrusting your crotch forward,"
00:20:51,00:20:52,wouldn't you?
00:20:52,00:20:54,Like whenever you fired this gun.
00:20:54,00:20:56,"Yeah, you would get blasted into the front stall."
00:20:56,00:20:58,So you're a kind of human cannonball.
00:20:59,00:21:02,The nasty man's nowhere to be seen.
00:21:02,00:21:04,It's so amazing.
00:21:04,00:21:06,"The Henry Ball Belt Pistol, I love it."
00:21:06,00:21:08,"Oh, you could just hire some bodyguards"
00:21:08,00:21:11,"to walk you to and from the pub,"
00:21:11,00:21:14,like the Bayswater Brothers who advertised.
00:21:14,00:21:18,The Bayswater Brothers whose height is respected
00:21:18,00:21:20,"with six feet four inches and six feet 11,"
00:21:20,00:21:22,and the United Breadth of whose shoulders
00:21:22,00:21:25,"extends to as much as three yards, one foot five inches."
00:21:25,00:21:27,Give respectfully notice to the gentry and public
00:21:27,00:21:29,"of Paddington, Kensington, Stoke, Newington,"
00:21:29,00:21:31,"Chelsea, Eaton Square, and Sheppard's Bush"
00:21:31,00:21:32,that they will be most happy
00:21:32,00:21:35,upon all social and jovial expeditions
00:21:35,00:21:37,to escort elderly or nervous persons
00:21:37,00:21:38,in the streets after dark.
00:21:38,00:21:41,"Wow, they sound great."
00:21:41,00:21:45,So they'd served several months in the police force
00:21:45,00:21:48,"and they would go through any neighborhood,"
00:21:48,00:21:51,even the worst grotting district well known.
00:21:51,00:21:53,"Yeah, but they don't go south of the river, do they?"
00:21:53,00:21:54,Typical.
00:21:54,00:21:55,It's just like cabbies all over again.
00:21:56,00:21:58,"No, grotting south of the river."
00:21:58,00:21:59,Wow.
00:21:59,00:22:02,Some more kind of panics.
00:22:02,00:22:04,"Oh, yeah."
00:22:04,00:22:08,Because I'm saying that this grotting wasn't really a thing.
00:22:08,00:22:11,"It might have been a thing, but that's the kind of angle I'm taking."
00:22:11,00:22:13,It's definitely a way smaller thing than
00:22:13,00:22:16,the 1863 Garottas Act would suggest.
00:22:16,00:22:22,"In 1954, a load of people in Seattle were really worried"
00:22:22,00:22:24,because there were loads of holes in their windscreens.
00:22:25,00:22:27,And everyone was going out looking at their car
00:22:27,00:22:30,and they find little holes and they didn't know what had happened.
00:22:30,00:22:31,They thought it was vandals.
00:22:31,00:22:34,They thought it might have been fallout from nuclear tests
00:22:34,00:22:37,"that were happening, to be honest, not that close to Seattle,"
00:22:37,00:22:39,but they thought maybe it was that.
00:22:39,00:22:42,And then a load of scientists were brought in
00:22:42,00:22:44,and they looked at what had happened.
00:22:44,00:22:48,"And it turned out that these pits were there all along,"
00:22:48,00:22:51,"but it was just happened that in that year, 1954,"
00:22:51,00:22:54,"someone noticed it and then everyone else went,"
00:22:54,00:22:55,"""Oh my God, I've got that as well."""
00:22:55,00:22:57,"""Oh my God, I've got that as well."""
00:22:57,00:22:58,"That's very funny, that's so weird."
00:22:58,00:23:02,"Yeah, in 1788, you have the London Monster."
00:23:02,00:23:03,"Oh, yeah."
00:23:03,00:23:03,"Oh, yes."
00:23:03,00:23:06,Who was a guy who went around basically
00:23:06,00:23:10,"stabbing ladies in the skirt area,"
00:23:10,00:23:13,ripping their clothes.
00:23:13,00:23:16,Sometimes he'd be presenting them with flowers
00:23:16,00:23:19,and there'd be something sharp concealed within them.
00:23:19,00:23:19,"Oh, no."
00:23:19,00:23:22,"Yeah, it was a disgrace."
00:23:23,00:23:25,But it probably didn't happen.
00:23:25,00:23:27,"Oh, okay, roll a question."
00:23:27,00:23:30,There were up to 50 women reported to the police
00:23:30,00:23:30,that they'd been attacked.
00:23:30,00:23:34,And it was like approving that some of these women
00:23:34,00:23:36,had inflicted wounds themselves.
00:23:36,00:23:38,They were just scratched or they just ripped the dress.
00:23:38,00:23:41,But somebody did get convicted.
00:23:41,00:23:45,"A woman was attacked in the January, I think, of 1790."
00:23:45,00:23:51,"And she saw a guy in the park six months later,"
00:23:51,00:23:53,got a boyfriend to follow him home.
00:23:53,00:23:58,"It was this ex-Ballet dancer who now made artificial flowers,"
00:23:58,00:24:02,"this Welsh guy, who got up before the beak"
00:24:02,00:24:06,and they found out that the worst offence they could charge him with
00:24:06,00:24:08,was actually damaging clothes.
00:24:08,00:24:08,"Oh, right."
00:24:08,00:24:14,Apparently they're damaging clothes under the law at the time
00:24:14,00:24:19,because their expensive foreign clothes came with a harsher penalty
00:24:19,00:24:22,than actually injuring these women attempting murder and stabbing.
00:24:23,00:24:26,"So eventually this guy got six years,"
00:24:26,00:24:29,"but mysteriously there were no attacks after that,"
00:24:29,00:24:31,even though he probably wasn't the attacker.
00:24:31,00:24:33,"But during a two-year period,"
00:24:33,00:24:36,women started wearing copper pans under their petticoats
00:24:36,00:24:41,as a form of self-defense against the London monster.
00:24:41,00:24:46,So there's a James Gilray engraving of the monster
00:24:46,00:24:48,attacking a woman in a pulsa pescat
00:24:48,00:24:51,"and there's just a pan there, so he's disappointed."
00:24:51,00:24:52,"Yeah, well, you would be."
00:24:52,00:24:53,Thank you.
00:24:53,00:24:58,Did you say this was 1788 that this was happening?
00:24:58,00:25:01,"1788 it started, yeah, to 1790."
00:25:01,00:25:06,I didn't think there were people making artificial flowers in the 1780s.
00:25:06,00:25:08,"Yeah, they'd be made of silk, I would guess, rather than..."
00:25:08,00:25:12,"Yeah, I just sort of assumed that they were a thing from the '70s onwards,"
00:25:12,00:25:15,like kind of like plastic or...
00:25:15,00:25:16,I can't believe that.
00:25:16,00:25:18,"Is that what you got out of that story, Andy?"
00:25:18,00:25:19,"Apparently, apparently, yes."
00:25:21,00:25:23,"In the earliest, earliest days of this podcast,"
00:25:23,00:25:26,"I mentioned a fact about the precursor to the London monster,"
00:25:26,00:25:28,which was a man who used to go around London
00:25:28,00:25:31,and he would slap women on the bum and then he would run off
00:25:31,00:25:33,"and as he ran off, he would yell, ""Spanko!"""
00:25:33,00:25:38,I think he was called whipping Tom or something like that.
00:25:38,00:25:41,"Can I just say with that, I think in that case,"
00:25:41,00:25:44,"if you had a copper pan in your petticoats,"
00:25:44,00:25:46,"then it would have the opposite effect,"
00:25:46,00:25:48,because it would make a really nice resonant sound
00:25:48,00:25:50,if you spanked someone and they were like...
00:25:50,00:25:51,"Yeah, absolutely."
00:25:51,00:25:53,"...a copper pot there, wouldn't it?"
00:25:53,00:25:53,That's true.
00:25:53,00:25:54,Like playing the timpani.
00:25:54,00:25:56,That would be like the J. Arthur rank symbol
00:25:56,00:25:58,"at the beginning of films, wouldn't it?"
00:25:58,00:26:01,"It's a spanko running on,"
00:26:01,00:26:03,hitting a petticoat and running off.
00:26:03,00:26:06,So was he caught?
00:26:06,00:26:07,"Dan, was he caught?"
00:26:07,00:26:09,Do we know who the real Spanko was?
00:26:09,00:26:11,"Oh, Spanko? No, I don't know any..."
00:26:11,00:26:12,"I just... That's an old memory,"
00:26:12,00:26:14,as Jenny was talking about the London monster.
00:26:14,00:26:16,He was a precursor.
00:26:16,00:26:18,"But yeah, amazing character, the London monster."
00:26:19,00:26:21,And huge panic off the back of that.
00:26:21,00:26:25,"Oh yeah, if James Gilray is doing engravings of you,"
00:26:25,00:26:26,then you know you've made it.
00:26:26,00:26:27,Yeah.
00:26:27,00:26:28,I don't know James Gilray.
00:26:28,00:26:30,Was he Mr. Engraver back then?
00:26:30,00:26:31,"Oh, he was Mr..."
00:26:31,00:26:35,"You know, your political cartoons, those are all him."
00:26:35,00:26:38,"You know, he's the Steve Bell of his day."
00:26:38,00:26:39,"I didn't know who it was either,"
00:26:39,00:26:40,"but I thought by keeping quiet,"
00:26:40,00:26:41,people would assume that I did.
00:26:41,00:26:46,"You've definitely, definitely 100% seen his work."
00:26:46,00:26:46,Okay.
00:26:46,00:26:50,"Yeah, there are all the really big complicated drawings"
00:26:50,00:26:52,where people have to be labelled quite precisely.
00:26:52,00:26:54,"So, you know, there's a brilliant engraving."
00:26:54,00:26:55,"I'm just making this up now,"
00:26:55,00:26:58,"but you know, there'll be a monkey and a hot-air balloon,"
00:26:58,00:26:59,but the monkey has to be labelled
00:26:59,00:27:01,Britain's response to the Eritrean.
00:27:01,00:27:05,And the balloon is labelled European integration
00:27:05,00:27:07,after the 1763 act of...
00:27:07,00:27:10,"Oh, I don't get this at all."
00:27:10,00:27:16,"But back in the day, people have one glanced at it like,"
00:27:16,00:27:17,"""Yeah, I've got it like, like... ""Brilliant art."
00:27:17,00:27:19,"""Marius, the Montaginius."""
00:27:19,00:27:27,"Okay, it's time for fact number three,"
00:27:27,00:27:29,and that is James.
00:27:29,00:27:33,"Okay, my fact this week is that for 24 years,"
00:27:33,00:27:37,any ship travelling between Wellington and Nelson in New Zealand
00:27:37,00:27:40,would be guided through the most dangerous section
00:27:40,00:27:42,"by a dolphin called ""Pelarous Jack""."
00:27:42,00:27:45,"I should have done that in a pirate voice,"
00:27:45,00:27:46,shouldn't I?
00:27:46,00:27:50,Would be guided through the most dangerous section
00:27:50,00:27:53,"by a dolphin called ""Pelarous Jack""."
00:27:53,00:27:54,Is that better? No.
00:27:54,00:27:57,I couldn't tell the difference.
00:27:57,00:28:03,"So, James, what north is this?"
00:28:03,00:28:04,This is a fact.
00:28:04,00:28:05,Okay.
00:28:05,00:28:06,Perhaps.
00:28:06,00:28:11,"So, at the north end of New Zealand's South Island,"
00:28:11,00:28:13,there's a little stretch of water.
00:28:13,00:28:14,"It's really, really perilous."
00:28:14,00:28:16,"It's called the French Pass,"
00:28:16,00:28:21,"and there are loads of really bad currents and high waves,"
00:28:21,00:28:22,and it could be really difficult to get through.
00:28:22,00:28:26,"And at the turn of the 20th century,"
00:28:26,00:28:28,any boat that was going through there
00:28:28,00:28:31,would always have this dolphin alongside it.
00:28:31,00:28:34,"Now, whether the dolphin was deliberately helping"
00:28:34,00:28:35,"the humans across,"
00:28:35,00:28:38,or whether it was just being a dolphin
00:28:38,00:28:41,"and kind of swimming in the wake of a boat,"
00:28:41,00:28:43,"like dolphins often do, we don't know."
00:28:43,00:28:44,"Well, we do know,"
00:28:44,00:28:46,because it didn't even know it was a dolphin.
00:28:46,00:28:48,It was just a goat.
00:28:48,00:28:48,But what is true...
00:28:48,00:28:50,"But it was there. It was there, right?"
00:28:50,00:28:51,"It was there, and people believed"
00:28:51,00:28:53,that that's what was happening.
00:28:53,00:28:55,"So, people were writing at the time,"
00:28:55,00:28:58,"there's articles from 1905, 1906,"
00:28:58,00:29:00,"where people said they were on this boat,"
00:29:00,00:29:03,"and the dolphin was acting as a pilot for the ships,"
00:29:03,00:29:05,and that it would take them deliberately
00:29:05,00:29:08,"into the areas where the water was deeper,"
00:29:08,00:29:10,because it knew there would be less chance
00:29:10,00:29:13,of the boat being smashed on the rocks.
00:29:13,00:29:17,"And then, some people didn't like the dolphin being there,"
00:29:17,00:29:18,and some people shot at it.
00:29:18,00:29:21,"On one particular time, when someone shot this dolphin,"
00:29:21,00:29:23,there was a law that came up that said
00:29:23,00:29:26,you are specifically not allowed to shoot
00:29:26,00:29:29,"this particular dolphin in New Zealand,"
00:29:29,00:29:30,and it was the first sea creature
00:29:30,00:29:33,to be protected by law anywhere in the world.
00:29:33,00:29:36,"I mean, between this and the 1863 Garotas Act,"
00:29:36,00:29:39,it does feel like legislators had a lot more time on their hands
00:29:39,00:29:40,back in the day.
00:29:42,00:29:45,"But so, the story goes that the boat,"
00:29:45,00:29:50,"the ship that shot at Jack was called the SS Penguin,"
00:29:50,00:29:52,"and the story goes that he disappeared,"
00:29:52,00:29:55,"and he came back later, but five years later,"
00:29:55,00:29:58,"the SS Penguin struck rocks and sank,"
00:29:58,00:30:03,"and 75 passengers perished, and as the story goes,"
00:30:03,00:30:06,"it's because Jack, when he saw the SS Penguin coming,"
00:30:06,00:30:07,would ignore it.
00:30:07,00:30:09,"He knew that that was the boat that shot him,"
00:30:09,00:30:11,"and so, maybe without his help,"
00:30:11,00:30:14,that's what led to it being slammed into the rocks.
00:30:14,00:30:15,It's a great story. I love it.
00:30:15,00:30:16,I should leave it.
00:30:16,00:30:19,"""Pellaris"" is a really weird name,"
00:30:19,00:30:21,"because I thought when you said that the French Pass,"
00:30:21,00:30:23,"this strait of water was very perilous,"
00:30:23,00:30:24,"I thought, oh, maybe it's a burden of that."
00:30:24,00:30:25,I don't think it is.
00:30:25,00:30:26,"It's not, no."
00:30:26,00:30:27,It's a ship's instrument or something?
00:30:27,00:30:31,"There was a ship called the HMS Pellaris,"
00:30:31,00:30:34,"and there's a Pellaris, sorry,"
00:30:34,00:30:37,and it kind of went around that area of New Zealand
00:30:37,00:30:39,"and Australia, so there's a Pellaris Island as well,"
00:30:39,00:30:41,"and a few different things named after Pellaris,"
00:30:41,00:30:44,which was this discovery ship.
00:30:44,00:30:45,Okay.
00:30:45,00:30:49,"But Pellaris was also the name of Hannibal's pilot,"
00:30:49,00:30:51,so that may be where it comes from.
00:30:51,00:30:52,Hannibal.
00:30:52,00:30:53,Hannibal Lecter.
00:30:53,00:30:58,"Yeah, Hannibal Lecter needed a pilot to take him around to eat people."
00:30:58,00:30:59,You've got to have a private pilot.
00:30:59,00:31:01,You're a busy man.
00:31:01,00:31:03,These livers aren't going to cook themselves.
00:31:03,00:31:06,Do you mean Hannibal as in the...?
00:31:06,00:31:08,Hannibal as in the elephant dude.
00:31:08,00:31:09,The elephant dude.
00:31:09,00:31:10,Carthaginian general.
00:31:10,00:31:11,Elephant dude.
00:31:11,00:31:13,"Now sounds like we're talking about the elephant man,"
00:31:13,00:31:14,who is a different person to Hannibal.
00:31:14,00:31:17,That elephant dude would definitely be the name
00:31:17,00:31:19,"of Hannibal's YouTube channel, wouldn't it?"
00:31:19,00:31:23,We're going to try and take some elephants
00:31:23,00:31:24,and invade Rome next week.
00:31:24,00:31:25,It's going to be completely crazy.
00:31:25,00:31:27,Hit like and subscribe to see if it works.
00:31:27,00:31:32,"But yeah, there was, when I sent this fact round,"
00:31:32,00:31:37,"Andy, you found an article that said that perhaps it wasn't real,"
00:31:37,00:31:41,and that the fact that the people thought that Dolphin was guiding
00:31:41,00:31:44,people was invented quite a few years later.
00:31:44,00:31:49,"But I found an article from April 1905,"
00:31:49,00:31:52,"where there was a guy called Mr. Generous Hayes,"
00:31:52,00:31:54,who said that...
00:31:54,00:31:56,"No, not..."
00:31:56,00:31:59,Definitely not made up.
00:31:59,00:32:03,"What date in April, James?"
00:32:05,00:32:07,"It was the 29th of April,"
00:32:07,00:32:09,"but this story had come all the way from Australia,"
00:32:09,00:32:11,so it could definitely take 28 days
00:32:11,00:32:14,"to get to the central Somerset Gazette,"
00:32:14,00:32:15,which is where I read it.
00:32:15,00:32:21,"But he said that Jack acts as a most effective pilot,"
00:32:21,00:32:24,escorting all kinds of vessels in and out of the French Pass.
00:32:24,00:32:26,"Yeah, and he was sort of globally famous."
00:32:26,00:32:29,There's stories of Mark Twain specifically going on that route
00:32:29,00:32:30,to see him.
00:32:30,00:32:31,Wow.
00:32:31,00:32:33,"Yeah, and another, an English author"
00:32:33,00:32:34,called Frank T. Bullen as well.
00:32:34,00:32:36,Both had written about it.
00:32:36,00:32:39,"So, yeah, I think the contentious thing is,"
00:32:39,00:32:41,was he piloting them or was he just having fun?
00:32:41,00:32:42,In real.
00:32:42,00:32:44,But there's photos and so on.
00:32:44,00:32:45,"I must say, every time I read that,"
00:32:45,00:32:46,"I read that in a few places,"
00:32:46,00:32:50,and it always said well-known figures such as Mark Twain
00:32:50,00:32:52,and English author Frank T. Bullen.
00:32:52,00:32:55,"And I always thought, one of those I have heard of, for sure."
00:32:55,00:32:59,"I saw, when I saw New Zealand,"
00:32:59,00:33:01,"I obviously got in touch with my friend,"
00:33:01,00:33:06,"who's an ex-pat Kiwi, Amy, and I messaged her and I said,"
00:33:06,00:33:07,"""Have you heard of Pellaris Jack?"""
00:33:07,00:33:09,"And she went, ""Oh my God, I love him."
00:33:09,00:33:12,"""He's a celebrity dolphin in New Zealand."""
00:33:12,00:33:14,"And I was like, ""A celebrity dolphin."""
00:33:14,00:33:17,And there's more than one celebrity dolphin in New Zealand.
00:33:17,00:33:19,"It's a thing, and they all have statues."
00:33:19,00:33:25,"So, there's Oppo, who was famous in New Zealand"
00:33:25,00:33:28,"during the summer of 1955 to '56,"
00:33:28,00:33:30,"because he played with children,"
00:33:30,00:33:35,"and very soon after, he'd become stranded and died."
00:33:35,00:33:37,"So, that's a cheery story."
00:33:37,00:33:39,"Well, his full name was Oppo-Ni-Jack, wasn't it?"
00:33:39,00:33:40,"Yeah, Oppo-Ni-Jack."
00:33:40,00:33:41,"Oh, wow. Sorry."
00:33:41,00:33:44,"Pellaris Jack himself, because he's the archetype"
00:33:44,00:33:47,"of celebrity dolphins in New Zealand, obviously."
00:33:47,00:33:56,And then Mokko came around in 2006 to do a similar kind of thing.
00:33:56,00:33:58,"But, you know, neither of them was that useful."
00:33:58,00:33:59,They weren't guiding.
00:33:59,00:34:02,"They were just kind of interhumans, so became quite famous."
00:34:02,00:34:05,"Mokko was a guide on one famous occasion,"
00:34:05,00:34:09,"because, again, another Kiwi dolphin."
00:34:09,00:34:12,"In 2008, there were two pygmy sperm whales who were trapped."
00:34:12,00:34:14,I think they were trapped between the beach
00:34:14,00:34:16,and a sand bank that was built up.
00:34:16,00:34:18,"But they didn't know what to do,"
00:34:18,00:34:20,"and the authorities were saying,"
00:34:20,00:34:22,"""Oh, well, should we kill them?"
00:34:22,00:34:24,"""Because otherwise, they're going to really suffer,"
00:34:24,00:34:25,"""and they might die."""
00:34:25,00:34:29,And Mokko the dolphin led them out through a narrow channel
00:34:29,00:34:31,"at the end of the sand bank that they were in,"
00:34:31,00:34:32,so there was a bit of water
00:34:32,00:34:34,that was just deep enough to get these whales through.
00:34:34,00:34:37,"So, obviously, it became a huge celebrity,"
00:34:37,00:34:40,"and then it all went to his head, and he started sexually..."
00:34:40,00:34:41,Doing a lot of cocaine.
00:34:41,00:34:44,"Well, he started sexually assaulting swimmers,"
00:34:44,00:34:48,"and I know it is, you know, celebrity excess."
00:34:48,00:34:51,He started making what was called amorous advances
00:34:51,00:34:54,"to women in the water, and also just being a bit of a thug."
00:34:54,00:34:56,"He started tipping over water skiers,"
00:34:56,00:34:57,"and I can't believe this,"
00:34:57,00:34:59,but apparently stealing surfers' surfboards?
00:34:59,00:35:01,"Now, I don't know..."
00:35:01,00:35:03,I can't envisage how a dolphin does that.
00:35:03,00:35:05,Why do you need to?
00:35:05,00:35:07,You're already quite efficient in the water.
00:35:07,00:35:09,I mean...
00:35:09,00:35:13,"For a dolphin, a surfboard might be like a hoverboard for a human."
00:35:13,00:35:14,"Like, he might..."
00:35:14,00:35:15,"Oh, yeah."
00:35:15,00:35:17,Can you imagine if you're a dolphin
00:35:17,00:35:18,and one of your mates comes along
00:35:18,00:35:21,and he's just kind of lying on a surfboard?
00:35:21,00:35:22,That guy is cool.
00:35:22,00:35:23,He's chilling.
00:35:23,00:35:25,"OK, so James is trying to justify Mokko's crime wave."
00:35:25,00:35:28,You Mokko apologist.
00:35:28,00:35:32,"But he still has a statue, though."
00:35:32,00:35:34,"They are all blooming statues, yeah."
00:35:34,00:35:34,Wow.
00:35:34,00:35:37,Going to commemorate your local celebrity dolphin.
00:35:37,00:35:39,That didn't get pulled down in the whole recent...
00:35:39,00:35:42,It might be re-evaluated.
00:35:42,00:35:46,You know who also seems to be into New Zealand dolphins?
00:35:46,00:35:48,Is the Scottish.
00:35:48,00:35:52,"So, it's just a very curious thing,"
00:35:52,00:35:57,but Perilous Jack was turned into a song and a dance in Scotland.
00:35:57,00:36:02,And so there's a song that goes...
00:36:02,00:36:03,"And I don't know the music to it,"
00:36:03,00:36:06,but a famous fish there used to be called Pelerous Jack.
00:36:06,00:36:09,He'd always swim far out to sea when a ship came back.
00:36:09,00:36:14,And this got turned into a dance which you could do.
00:36:14,00:36:16,"And there's a move called the dolphin hay,"
00:36:16,00:36:18,which I guess is a bit like the pop goes the weasel.
00:36:18,00:36:21,It's sort of like a dolphin move.
00:36:22,00:36:23,"So that was turned into a dance,"
00:36:23,00:36:26,"and there's a full dance routine about Pelerous Jack,"
00:36:26,00:36:28,"but also Oppo, who we were talking about,"
00:36:28,00:36:32,in 1994 was also turned into a Scottish dance as well.
00:36:32,00:36:33,Yeah.
00:36:33,00:36:36,"So, if you go to Scotland,"
00:36:36,00:36:39,likely there are people who know two New Zealand dolphin dances.
00:36:39,00:36:41,"Well, Dan, I've got some ends"
00:36:41,00:36:44,"with the Scottish country dancing community,"
00:36:44,00:36:46,and I can confirm there's no shortage of things
00:36:46,00:36:47,they've named dances after.
00:36:47,00:36:51,There are so many hundreds of dances that I'm kind of...
00:36:51,00:36:55,And they're just going through Wikipedia on random pages
00:36:55,00:36:57,"and going, ""Okay, well, I'm going to do this"
00:36:57,00:37:00,"after George Washington High School in Milwaukee."""
00:37:00,00:37:05,It is amazing the number of things they have done so now after.
00:37:05,00:37:06,"Yeah, very cool."
00:37:06,00:37:09,I think it must be an extension of the nursery rhyme thing.
00:37:09,00:37:12,So Scottish country dancing has taken up the mantle.
00:37:12,00:37:15,Have you ever done any Scottish country dancing?
00:37:15,00:37:15,"What, me?"
00:37:15,00:37:16,Yeah.
00:37:16,00:37:17,"Yeah, yeah, I've done a bit."
00:37:17,00:37:18,"Yeah, it's great."
00:37:18,00:37:20,"It's really, really fun."
00:37:20,00:37:21,Do you know the dolphin hay?
00:37:21,00:37:23,"I don't know the dolphin hay, no."
00:37:23,00:37:26,"I'm not off the top of your head, but..."
00:37:26,00:37:27,"Thousands of dances, Dan."
00:37:27,00:37:31,"It's not entry level, anyway."
00:37:31,00:37:32,"No, absolutely not."
00:37:32,00:37:34,That's a dashing white sergeant is the first thing you learn.
00:37:34,00:37:36,I think you have to be pretty...
00:37:36,00:37:37,You have to be balls deep
00:37:37,00:37:39,before you learn the dolphin hay off by heart.
00:37:39,00:37:43,Did you do country dancing at school?
00:37:43,00:37:44,"No, I didn't."
00:37:44,00:37:45,"Jenny, did you?"
00:37:45,00:37:48,I remember a couple of sessions of it
00:37:48,00:37:50,when they didn't have a PE teacher.
00:37:50,00:37:55,Emergency country dance.
00:37:55,00:37:58,"It was raining, and so a teacher,"
00:37:58,00:38:00,he happened to know some country dancing.
00:38:00,00:38:02,"Oh, OK, so you didn't have a dance instructor"
00:38:02,00:38:06,who'd been kept in a cupboard for years until the PE teacher fell ill.
00:38:06,00:38:08,"Because when I was at primary school,"
00:38:08,00:38:10,"so Jenny and I went to the same secondary school,"
00:38:10,00:38:11,"but when I was at primary school,"
00:38:11,00:38:14,we did country dancing every week.
00:38:14,00:38:14,Wow.
00:38:14,00:38:16,Was it English country dancing you were doing?
00:38:16,00:38:18,"It's like Morris dancing, I guess."
00:38:18,00:38:22,"It's like, all I remember is that you had to dozee-doh your partner."
00:38:22,00:38:24,"Yeah, that's all I remember."
00:38:24,00:38:25,All I remember is dozee-doh.
00:38:25,00:38:28,"There is one dance that's an English country dance,"
00:38:28,00:38:31,and English country dancing's a bit rarer for whatever reason.
00:38:31,00:38:32,"There are still loads of dances,"
00:38:32,00:38:34,"but they just don't get danced as much,"
00:38:34,00:38:35,because they're all from Jane Austen's time.
00:38:35,00:38:38,But there's one which is called Mr. Beveridge's Maggot.
00:38:38,00:38:41,It's my favourite name of a dance.
00:38:41,00:38:43,That's wonderful.
00:38:43,00:38:44,That's absolutely wonderful.
00:38:44,00:38:46,And what happens at the end of that?
00:38:46,00:38:48,"Um, I don't know."
00:38:48,00:38:50,I don't know if this was named after an actual maggot
00:38:50,00:38:52,"that was like a celebrity maggot,"
00:38:52,00:38:56,which saved a carriage from crashing or whatever.
00:38:56,00:39:01,I don't know what to go from there.
00:39:01,00:39:02,Dolphins?
00:39:02,00:39:04,Let's talk about dolphins.
00:39:04,00:39:04,"Yeah, yes."
00:39:04,00:39:09,"One thing that dolphins do, which I didn't know,"
00:39:09,00:39:12,is that they can wear gloves over their noses.
00:39:13,00:39:16,"Okay, well, this is amazing."
00:39:16,00:39:20,"Andy, is this a real glove over a nose,"
00:39:20,00:39:22,or is this an analogy for a glove over a nose?
00:39:22,00:39:25,"Because Sarah Pascoe called us out last week,"
00:39:25,00:39:29,"if you remember, about this ladybird bought a hat."
00:39:29,00:39:32,And then it's never an actual hat.
00:39:32,00:39:35,"Oh my god, I've fallen right into the Pascoe ladybird hat trap,"
00:39:35,00:39:37,"because no, it's not a glove."
00:39:37,00:39:38,"It's not a glove. Obviously, it's not a glove."
00:39:38,00:39:39,What is it?
00:39:39,00:39:41,"They, so, you know, marine sponges."
00:39:43,00:39:45,"They're animals, technically, aren't they?"
00:39:45,00:39:47,The sponges are very simple animals.
00:39:47,00:39:50,"They kind of pick up these sponges,"
00:39:50,00:39:53,and they press them onto the end of their snouts.
00:39:53,00:39:56,"And then when they're foraging, they're using their snout,"
00:39:56,00:39:58,and they are probing for prey sometimes
00:39:58,00:39:59,under the surface of the sea.
00:39:59,00:40:01,But there can be sharp things there.
00:40:01,00:40:04,And so these sponges on their noses
00:40:04,00:40:08,"act as a kind of bit of protective equipment, if you like,"
00:40:08,00:40:12,to stop them hurting themselves when they're jamming around there.
00:40:12,00:40:15,"And they particularly pick conical sponges,"
00:40:15,00:40:18,because they can jam them more easily onto the end of their noses.
00:40:18,00:40:19,They're nice.
00:40:19,00:40:19,That's cool.
00:40:19,00:40:20,Yeah.
00:40:20,00:40:22,"I think glove is acceptable for that,"
00:40:22,00:40:24,because that's basically their hand.
00:40:24,00:40:26,And they're putting something over the hand
00:40:26,00:40:28,so they can go rippling about in things.
00:40:28,00:40:30,"So, yeah, I'll accept it."
00:40:30,00:40:32,I'm not going to Pascoe you on this.
00:40:32,00:40:34,I don't know.
00:40:34,00:40:36,"If James hadn't called Andy out just then,"
00:40:36,00:40:37,"I would be at parties going,"
00:40:37,00:40:39,"""You know they wear marigolds on their face?"""
00:40:42,00:40:44,Dolphins can talk to each other on the telephone.
00:40:44,00:40:46,Jesus Christ.
00:40:46,00:40:46,OK.
00:40:46,00:40:50,I think we all want to Pascoe you on this one.
00:40:50,00:40:53,"Well, there was an aquarium in Hawaii"
00:40:53,00:40:56,"where they had the mother in a separate tank,"
00:40:56,00:40:59,to a two-year-old calf dolphin.
00:40:59,00:41:04,And they organised an audio link between the two tanks
00:41:04,00:41:06,and got them chatting to each other.
00:41:06,00:41:08,And the calls and responses were in line
00:41:08,00:41:11,"with the kind of calls and responses you would hear in the wild,"
00:41:11,00:41:12,even though they couldn't see each other.
00:41:12,00:41:13,And they don't know what they said.
00:41:13,00:41:16,We've spoken about the dolphin dictionary
00:41:16,00:41:18,"that they're working on at the moment, scientists."
00:41:18,00:41:21,But we do know that they were calling responses
00:41:21,00:41:22,that were happening.
00:41:22,00:41:25,"And it's sort of, they think the conversation was like,"
00:41:25,00:41:27,"""Hey, what's your name? Oh, my name's this. Oh, great."
00:41:27,00:41:29,"There's lots of fish here. Oh, that's good to know."""
00:41:29,00:41:33,"Yeah, so they can chat over the phone."
00:41:33,00:41:36,"OK, actually, again, sounded unreasonable,"
00:41:36,00:41:37,but I think that's completely legit.
00:41:37,00:41:39,They can chat over the phone.
00:41:39,00:41:41,"They can't dial, and they can't, you know..."
00:41:41,00:41:42,No.
00:41:42,00:41:45,"They'd have to take the glove off to dial, obviously."
00:41:45,00:41:51,"So, also, dolphins can attack enemies of the Soviet Union."
00:41:51,00:41:56,"Because that's the thing, isn't it?"
00:41:56,00:42:00,"Dolphins, they are trained in various armies."
00:42:00,00:42:02,"The Americans have done it, and the Soviets did it."
00:42:02,00:42:05,Their first use of dolphins by the Navy
00:42:05,00:42:09,"was in 1970 in Vietnam, where they were put on guard duty"
00:42:09,00:42:11,for the Americans.
00:42:11,00:42:15,"Was that river dolphins, or was it sea going dolphins?"
00:42:15,00:42:19,That's a really good point. I don't know about that.
00:42:19,00:42:21,I don't know. It's actually the least relevant part
00:42:21,00:42:24,"of the most amazing fact I've ever heard, obviously."
00:42:24,00:42:26,"I mean, the dolphins fought in Nam"
00:42:26,00:42:27,"is a more interesting factor,"
00:42:27,00:42:29,whether they were river or ocean dolphins.
00:42:29,00:42:31,But you do get river dolphins in Vietnam.
00:42:31,00:42:34,"Yeah, I suspect there'd be river dolphins there,"
00:42:34,00:42:36,because it was the Mekong Delta and all that.
00:42:36,00:42:38,"So, I'm guessing there would be guarding"
00:42:38,00:42:40,certain entry and exit points.
00:42:40,00:42:42,"Fingers, Andy. You always ask the questions"
00:42:42,00:42:44,that the people at home are all thinking.
00:42:44,00:42:53,"And the Soviet Union, they used their dolphin guards."
00:42:53,00:42:56,"They would carry a titanium clump on their nose,"
00:42:56,00:42:58,which was about the size of a ping-pong ball.
00:42:58,00:43:02,And they would attach it to a diver that they found.
00:43:03,00:43:07,And the little kind of thing would report back
00:43:07,00:43:09,"and tell you where that person is, so you'd be able to find them."
00:43:09,00:43:13,"And if they couldn't find them, eventually,"
00:43:13,00:43:15,the ping-pong ball thing would inject
00:43:15,00:43:18,a high-pressure charge of CO2 into the diver's body.
00:43:18,00:43:21,"Oh, so this is an enemy diver, is it?"
00:43:21,00:43:23,"Well, like a U.S. diver or whatever."
00:43:23,00:43:24,"That's the idea, yeah."
00:43:24,00:43:25,"To tag them, and a guard."
00:43:25,00:43:30,"And again, I don't know exactly what species of dolphin it was."
00:43:30,00:43:36,[music]
00:43:36,00:43:39,"OK, it's time for our final fact of the show."
00:43:39,00:43:40,That is my fact.
00:43:40,00:43:43,My fact this week is that the Arthakonin Doyle estate
00:43:43,00:43:46,is currently suing Netflix for showing Sherlock Holmes
00:43:46,00:43:49,as having feelings and respecting women.
00:43:49,00:43:54,So this is really interesting.
00:43:54,00:43:59,"So Netflix is making a movie called Enola Holmes,"
00:43:59,00:44:03,"and it is the story of the teenage sister of Sherlock Holmes,"
00:44:03,00:44:06,and Sherlock Holmes appears as a character in it.
00:44:06,00:44:10,"And in the show, they show him as having sort of"
00:44:10,00:44:14,"not sociopath qualities that we know Sherlock to have,"
00:44:14,00:44:16,but to be warmer and gentler.
00:44:16,00:44:18,And the Conan Doyle estate is claiming
00:44:18,00:44:20,"they are unable to represent him like that,"
00:44:20,00:44:23,"because yes, even though Sherlock does have those feelings,"
00:44:23,00:44:26,he did eventually sort of respect women
00:44:26,00:44:29,and become a nicer character.
00:44:29,00:44:31,He only became that in the last 10 stories
00:44:31,00:44:33,that were written by Conan Doyle.
00:44:33,00:44:35,And it just so happens that those 10 stories
00:44:35,00:44:38,are the only stories that are still in copyright
00:44:38,00:44:40,and belong to the Conan Doyle estate.
00:44:40,00:44:43,So anyone who wants to use the ad of copyright
00:44:43,00:44:46,"has to use the more mean, misogynistic Holmes,"
00:44:46,00:44:47,and they're fine.
00:44:47,00:44:49,"But if you want to show him being a nice guy,"
00:44:49,00:44:50,you're going to be sued.
00:44:50,00:44:50,Wow.
00:44:50,00:44:54,There's a few other things that you're not allowed to...
00:44:55,00:44:59,"Or if you do show Sherlock having these characteristics,"
00:44:59,00:45:00,"then you have to pay them, pay the family."
00:45:00,00:45:05,"So if you show Holmes and Watson having a genuine friendship,"
00:45:05,00:45:07,that's in copyright.
00:45:07,00:45:10,"If you show his love of nature, that is."
00:45:10,00:45:14,"And if you ever show him liking dogs, that's in copyright."
00:45:14,00:45:16,So if you ever make...
00:45:16,00:45:18,I'm just going to say this to everyone out there.
00:45:18,00:45:20,"If you're making your own version of Sherlock Holmes,"
00:45:20,00:45:22,make sure that he doesn't like dogs whenever you do.
00:45:22,00:45:22,Yeah.
00:45:23,00:45:27,"I guess the hand of the basketballs is out of copyright,"
00:45:27,00:45:28,in which he doesn't like dogs.
00:45:28,00:45:29,No.
00:45:29,00:45:30,"No, it's quite right."
00:45:30,00:45:32,"And the thing is, if you are going to make"
00:45:32,00:45:34,"something where he does like dogs and respects women,"
00:45:34,00:45:37,"all you need to do actually is wait two or three more years,"
00:45:37,00:45:39,because that is...
00:45:39,00:45:41,We're in the final years of them owning this copyright.
00:45:41,00:45:44,I think that's why they're trying to rake in as much money
00:45:44,00:45:46,"as possible, because they're about to lose it entirely."
00:45:46,00:45:49,But these stories obviously have...
00:45:49,00:45:51,He wrote them over a lifetime.
00:45:51,00:45:54,So there's a bit of spread on when the copyright ends.
00:45:54,00:45:57,"And the final batch, these final 10 were written"
00:45:57,00:45:59,"after he returned from World War I,"
00:45:59,00:46:00,"and he lost his brother in the war,"
00:46:00,00:46:02,"he lost his eldest son,"
00:46:02,00:46:03,and he came back and he was a different man.
00:46:03,00:46:06,"And he thought, ""I want to reflect that in Sherlock."""
00:46:06,00:46:08,And so that's why there was this sudden change
00:46:08,00:46:10,in the attitude of Sherlock.
00:46:10,00:46:11,It's interesting.
00:46:11,00:46:14,"Yeah, I got deep into the legalese of all this,"
00:46:14,00:46:18,because that's my background.
00:46:18,00:46:21,So there's actually an in-fight between
00:46:21,00:46:24,the Conan Doyle estate limited
00:46:24,00:46:26,"and Arthur Conan Doyle's literary estates,"
00:46:26,00:46:32,both of whom claim to have the copyright of those stories.
00:46:32,00:46:35,And it's actually the Conan Doyle estate limited
00:46:35,00:46:38,is the litigious one of those two.
00:46:38,00:46:42,And so they are described by the literary estate
00:46:42,00:46:46,"as copyright trolls, which is a whole new tale."
00:46:46,00:46:50,"So tracing it back,"
00:46:50,00:46:53,the way that the story is told by the literary estate
00:46:53,00:46:59,is that all the rights were sold after Conan Doyle's death
00:46:59,00:47:01,"because the three inheriting children,"
00:47:01,00:47:04,"so it's two daughters and the widow of his son,"
00:47:04,00:47:08,couldn't agree on anything.
00:47:08,00:47:10,So they all sold to the widow.
00:47:10,00:47:15,"And from then on, she went bankrupt"
00:47:15,00:47:17,and the rights were acquired by someone else
00:47:17,00:47:18,who was acquired by someone else.
00:47:18,00:47:20,And so they traced that route back.
00:47:20,00:47:26,"In 2000-ish, when EU copyright law started to indicate"
00:47:26,00:47:30,that there wasn't much money left to be squeezed out
00:47:30,00:47:32,"in Europe of the literary copyright,"
00:47:32,00:47:36,"that's when Conan Doyle estate limited,"
00:47:36,00:47:38,which is some descendants of Conan Doyle himself
00:47:38,00:47:44,decided to put the squeeze on some of the studios
00:47:44,00:47:45,who are interested in his work.
00:47:45,00:47:48,So they basically went and threatened Warner Brothers
00:47:48,00:47:51,when they made the Robert Downey Jr. versions.
00:47:51,00:47:55,"And because in those films,"
00:47:55,00:47:57,he's got a romance with Irene Adler.
00:47:57,00:48:00,There's all that sort of stuff that would come under
00:48:00,00:48:02,the sort of stipulations.
00:48:02,00:48:05,And the...
00:48:05,00:48:07,I think it would be fair to threaten those filmmakers
00:48:07,00:48:10,actually at the Robert Downey Jr. Sherlock Holmes
00:48:10,00:48:11,in the game of Thanos movie.
00:48:11,00:48:14,"No, the people you want to threaten"
00:48:14,00:48:15,are the people who made Holmes and Watson.
00:48:15,00:48:18,"What? Oh, sorry."
00:48:18,00:48:20,"This is Dad's favourite film, The Will's Feral Sherlock Holmes."
00:48:20,00:48:21,It's so good.
00:48:21,00:48:26,"Yeah, but nowhere in Holmes is he bloody hilarious."
00:48:26,00:48:27,"I think, oh, true."
00:48:27,00:48:28,There you go.
00:48:28,00:48:30,So that's actually more of a divergence
00:48:30,00:48:31,from the original text.
00:48:31,00:48:34,And I'm guessing that that studio paid them off.
00:48:34,00:48:39,"Do you know the, obviously, the very famous quote,"
00:48:39,00:48:40,"""elementary, my dear Watson?"""
00:48:40,00:48:46,It never said in any of the written work of Conan Doyle's.
00:48:46,00:48:48,So it's a line that came much later.
00:48:48,00:48:51,But there's someone who runs a site called Quote Investigator
00:48:51,00:48:53,who's written a fantastic article
00:48:53,00:48:55,about trying to find the very first instances
00:48:55,00:48:58,"where we use ""elementary, my dear Watson."""
00:48:58,00:49:02,"And the oldest that he could find was 1901,"
00:49:02,00:49:03,the Northampton Mercury.
00:49:03,00:49:06,They published a short parody featuring the characters
00:49:06,00:49:08,Shylock Combs and Pottson.
00:49:08,00:49:13,"And it is in that that the line ""elementary, my dear Pottson"""
00:49:13,00:49:14,is said.
00:49:14,00:49:15,Wow.
00:49:15,00:49:19,"Then in 1902, there was a piece that was written"
00:49:19,00:49:20,about Dr. Joseph Bell.
00:49:20,00:49:23,"Now, Dr. Joseph Bell is someone who it is claimed"
00:49:23,00:49:25,was the inspiration for Sherlock Holmes.
00:49:25,00:49:28,He was a doctor who could walk around and look at you
00:49:28,00:49:30,on site and pick out what was wrong with you
00:49:30,00:49:32,"by just simply staring at you,"
00:49:32,00:49:35,which is a thing that Sherlock is famous for doing.
00:49:35,00:49:37,"And in this article, the person writing it says,"
00:49:37,00:49:39,"""As the remarkable man would say,"
00:49:39,00:49:42,"'It is the merest elementary knowledge, my dear Watson.'"""
00:49:42,00:49:45,So that's the second closest that we get to it.
00:49:45,00:49:45,Yeah.
00:49:45,00:49:48,"But yeah, no one can find it in the actual canon itself"
00:49:48,00:49:50,of official Sherlock writings.
00:49:50,00:49:52,"I think if it was there, people would have found it, right?"
00:49:52,00:49:53,Yeah.
00:49:53,00:49:56,Because people do take these books very seriously.
00:49:56,00:49:57,You're right.
00:49:57,00:49:57,You get people.
00:49:57,00:49:58,And they're all digital now.
00:49:58,00:49:59,There's a search term.
00:49:59,00:50:00,"Yeah, it's a search term."
00:50:00,00:50:05,I've got just a recommendation of an extraordinary
00:50:05,00:50:08,real-life story to do with Sherlock and Conan Doyle.
00:50:08,00:50:09,That is worth reading.
00:50:09,00:50:13,So it's written by a guy called David Gran.
00:50:13,00:50:17,"And the story, it was published in The New Yorker"
00:50:17,00:50:19,and it was called Mysterious Circumstances.
00:50:19,00:50:23,"So basically, one of the leading Sherlock Holmes experts"
00:50:23,00:50:24,"in the world, living in Britain,"
00:50:24,00:50:31,"was found dead in his room, in his house, with no break-in."
00:50:31,00:50:35,No one could work out how anyone got out
00:50:35,00:50:37,because there was just one body in there.
00:50:37,00:50:41,So this turned in itself into a Sherlock Holmes-style mystery.
00:50:41,00:50:44,How did the leading expert of Sherlock Holmes die?
00:50:44,00:50:46,It was a guy called Richard Lancelin Green.
00:50:46,00:50:48,"He was the son of Roger Lancelin Green,"
00:50:48,00:50:51,"who wrote The King Arthur Fables in their modern version,"
00:50:51,00:50:53,with the most famous version that we would all know.
00:50:53,00:50:56,"And yeah, so it's extraordinary."
00:50:56,00:50:59,"He was found death by Garotting, by the way."
00:50:59,00:51:01,"Oh, hello."
00:51:01,00:51:01,Hello.
00:51:01,00:51:02,And what year was this?
00:51:02,00:51:03,Did he say the year then?
00:51:03,00:51:06,"No. Well, he wrote about it in 2004"
00:51:06,00:51:09,and it wasn't much long before that that this story happened.
00:51:09,00:51:12,Did he have one of those guns that shoots people in the crotch?
00:51:12,00:51:16,Because then I'm just trying to channel my inner Sherlock Holmes here.
00:51:16,00:51:20,"Yeah, I mean, I know the answer to the story, but it's not that."
00:51:20,00:51:22,"Is that Doctor, what was he called?"
00:51:22,00:51:24,Dr. Bell.
00:51:24,00:51:25,Bell.
00:51:25,00:51:27,"Yeah, he could tell just by looking at you"
00:51:27,00:51:29,if you'd been shot in the crotch.
00:51:32,00:51:35,This man is a Garotter. He's a nasty man.
00:51:35,00:51:38,"Sorry, Dad, carry on."
00:51:38,00:51:41,"No, no, I think that's all that I'd like to give in terms of details."
00:51:41,00:51:42,It's an extraordinary mystery.
00:51:42,00:51:45,Sherlock expert found Garotterd.
00:51:45,00:51:48,"Yeah, in a locked room mystery, and he's the only person in the room,"
00:51:48,00:51:50,no one knows who killed him.
00:51:50,00:51:53,There was a big paranoia on his part in the lead-up to his death
00:51:53,00:51:57,about people wanting to kill him that he told everyone about.
00:51:57,00:52:00,"It's a big mystery and the story does resolve,"
00:52:00,00:52:01,so I highly recommend reading it.
00:52:01,00:52:03,"Oh, you're not going to tell us?"
00:52:03,00:52:05,"No, no, it's honestly, that's what I was saying."
00:52:05,00:52:07,"This is just a, you need to read it."
00:52:07,00:52:10,It would be horrible to ruin the brilliance of this writing.
00:52:10,00:52:12,No spoilers.
00:52:12,00:52:15,"So have you told people how to get hold of this, how to find it?"
00:52:15,00:52:18,"Yeah, the New Yorker, Mysterious Circumstances,"
00:52:18,00:52:21,"it's called by David Gran, or in the book The Devil vs. Sherlock Holmes."
00:52:21,00:52:24,"But once we stop recording, you'll just tell us what happened, right?"
00:52:24,00:52:24,Because...
00:52:24,00:52:26,"Yes, absolutely."
00:52:26,00:52:28,"It was a self, he put his cravat on the wrong way around, didn't he?"
00:52:30,00:52:34,So easy.
00:52:34,00:52:38,"OK, that's it."
