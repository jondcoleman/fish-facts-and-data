WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
 Hi everyone, James here. Now, before we start this week's show, just a couple of bits of business,

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:10.640
 first of all, this episode was recorded while Anna was still away and so her place has been taken

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:18.320
 by one of my oldest friends, the absolute genius that is Jenny Ryan. Now, if you're a fan of quiz

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.800
 shows, you would know her as the vixen of The Chase. If you're a fan of singing talent shows,

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.680
 you might remember her from Celebrity X Factor last year where she got to the final.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.200
 If you're a fan of podcasts, which I know you are, you might know her from Fingers on Buzzers,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.880
 the brilliant quiz-based podcast that Jenny does with comedian Lucy Porter. And actually,

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.560
 if you go into the back catalogue of Fingers on Buzzers, you might find an old episode with myself

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:52.400
 and Anna Tyshinsky on, if you are missing her so much that you really need to hear her dulcet tones.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:01:09.120
 Okay, on with the podcast.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.640
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.840
 from four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting here

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.280
 with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin and special guest Jenny Ryan. And once again,

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.840
 we have gathered round our microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.560
 And in a particular order, here we go. Starting with you, Jenny.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.960
 Here we go. Trigger warning for grossness. One theory of the origin of the nursery rhyme

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:47.680
 Pussycat Pussycat is that it's a reference to Queen Anne's poor personal hygiene and an accumulation

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.160
 of grime that once fell out of a skirt during a service at St Paul's Cathedral.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:59.520
 Wow. Wow. Okay. Where to start with that one? Okay, well, let's start with the with the actual

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.400
 nursery rhyme because not everyone might know it, right? So how's it go? Andy, why don't you regale

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.040
 us with that? Oh, it's Pussycat Pussycat. Where have you been? I've been up to London to look at

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:16.240
 the Queen followed by loads more lines. There is more. Pussycat Pussycat. What did you there?

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.080
 I've chased a little mouse under her chair or I've frightened a little mouse under her chair.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.760
 That's actually the important bit now, I think. That is the important bit. Yeah, yeah.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:33.040
 So it's thought that little mouse is a mouse shaped deposit of all sorts of things that

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:41.520
 might accumulate in a time when nobody really had a bath or washed their nethers. So supposedly,

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:50.240
 this particular lump was known as a suttikin, although that may be a more modern name for them

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:57.600
 because they resembled little mice and people would have to go and sweep them up off the streets.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.800
 Wait, hang on. Are you saying that the TV series Suttie and Sweep has anything to do with this?

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.160
 No.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.760
 Thank goodness. Okay, great. Well, my childhood is intact. I will. I'll link them up somehow,

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:17.920
 right? So the word suttikins does exist. It comes from the Dutch. It was kind of a joke

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:25.120
 about Dutch women. Supposedly, they would put heaters up their dresses to keep warm. And some

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.240
 people thought that by doing so, they were breeding a small animal up there and that the animal would

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:37.760
 kind of drop out and they would find this thing. And the word came from the word sutt. It's similar

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.600
 to the word sutt, as in the stuff you get in of chimney. And of course, Suttie and Sweep is a pun

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.400
 on the fact that chimney sweeps would also find sutt. So they are linked in a way, Andy, if that's

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.080
 what you think. Oh, great. Okay. No, my childhood is ruined. Thank you very much. Yeah, brilliant.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:58.080
 What kind of person was running so low on inspiration for nursery rhymes that when they saw

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:04.400
 a mess-shaped mouse fall out of the Queens, that they thought this is perfect for kids?

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:11.360
 Well, I think what we should say is the most explanations for nursery rhymes are speculative

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:17.680
 at best. And there was a couple called Iona and Peter Opie who wrote the Oxford Dictionary of

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.880
 Nursery Rhymes. And they basically came to the conclusion that all of these things that people

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:30.400
 think probably not true and also that they might just be kind of nice words that kind of sound

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.280
 like a good poem and there might not be any reasoning behind them all. So whether that's

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.440
 true or whether it's not, I don't know. But the other thing is that Queen Anne had quite a lot

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:46.000
 of enemies, right? So it's possible that if this is true, this origin, that it was people trying to

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.840
 say bad things about her and you know that. Oh yeah, it was basically gossip, wasn't it? The nursery

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.320
 rhymes you've had a way of spreading anything is to make it into a little folk song and get it

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.440
 spreading around the streets of London. Weirdly, this is not the only nursery rhyme that Queen Anne

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:07.600
 is supposedly involved with. Really? Yeah, there's another one. Okay, so do you remember the Warming

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:15.040
 Pan, baby? Nope. So Anne, when she wasn't Queen yet, she was in line to the throne and so was her

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:25.040
 older sister, Mary. And their dad was James II, who was King. And in 1688, James II had a son,

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.240
 a baby boy, with his new wife, which displaced Mary and Anne from the line of succession. So

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.600
 they were kind of lowered down the rung now. And Anne was furious about this. She refused to attend

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:43.680
 the birth. And there was a rumour spread that the baby had not been born alive, a miscarriage,

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.880
 and actually a live baby had been smuggled into the bedroom in a warming pan, which were these

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:54.480
 big brass pans that you would put hot coals into warm up the bed. Right, that's the story.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:06:04.400
 Okay. Is that also untrue? But we might get the nursery rhyme, rocker by baby, from that child.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.360
 Really? Yeah. And what's the explanation behind it? It's incredibly furious. Okay.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:17.520
 That thing about how you thought that someone might swap the baby, isn't that why, and I'm going

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:22.320
 to get this wrong, but isn't the home secretary supposed to be at every birth? Is it the home

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:29.200
 secretary? Every royal birth, not every birth. It might not be the home secretary. No, it is,

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:35.280
 it is. It is the home secretary, yeah. Who's the current home secretary? Pretty Patel. Oh, man.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:40.160
 Imagine if she had to go around to every single birth in the country. But she would be saying,

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.080
 "Get back in there. Get back in there. Don't want you. Don't want you. Go on. Back up, you go."

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.720
 I love that idea that you would sort of shame people in history via children telling rhymes.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:56.320
 We don't do that so much these days. That would be an incredible satirical kids program where it's

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:02.480
 just us shaming politicians and so on with new songs that we put out. There was a nursery rhyme

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:09.120
 when I was a kid, which was called Maggie Thatcher sticker in the bin. So in a way, it still does

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:13.280
 continue that there will be, they'll probably sing Boris Johnson's sticker in the bin now.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:20.560
 It'll be any Prime Minister. Maggie Thatcher sticker in the bin, put the lid on, sell the

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:26.240
 tape her in. And I remember when she actually resigned as Prime Minister, they came in and

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:31.920
 told us in the classroom, and we all sang it. Really? Wow. We think we're about eight.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:38.000
 We had also Maggie Thatcher, Milk Snatcher kind of a little rhyme about that, didn't we?

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.480
 Yeah. Hey, just very quickly for international listeners, and I included myself slightly in

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:48.160
 this because I'm not O.F.A. with the British monarchy's history, but Queen Anne was a queen

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:54.960
 from her birthday, it was 1665 to 1714. And there's not really been much about her. She's not

00:07:54.960 --> 00:08:00.000
 one of the more popular people for pop culture, except for the fact that she had the movie The

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.880
 Favourite, which was a fairly recent one, which Olivia Coleman won the Oscar for the portrayal

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:09.760
 of her. But outside of that, she kind of slips through the cracks a bit in terms of people's

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:15.840
 knowledge about her. And the only stuff that really comes through is all this quite shaming

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:21.760
 sort of information about her, people attacking her for her looks and her hygiene and all the

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:29.760
 accounts of her body size and so on. It was claimed that when she passed away, 14 men had to carry her

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:33.840
 for her burial. And I don't know if this stuff is true. I don't know if this is part of the

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:38.800
 shaming of her, but that's kind of what we know about her. It's 100% true that she did have health

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:45.840
 problems and that she was definitely a large lady. She had a lot of gout. She really struggled with

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:53.280
 that. But there was definitely also a lot of... She had a lot of enemies. For instance, this thing

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:59.040
 at St. Paul's Cathedral, it was a Thanksgiving ceremony after the war. They just finished a war

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:04.240
 with either France or Spain. Spanish succession, wasn't it? Spanish succession. Yeah, I trust you

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:09.840
 to know that, Jen. I'll probably just throw out some half-remembered facts and then you can just

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:16.240
 fill in the gaps today, maybe. But they built stands along the side of the Strand and they had

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:22.800
 4,000 children singing patriotic songs while they walked down to St. Paul's Cathedral. But a lot of

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:26.960
 people weren't really happy with it because they thought that Queen Anne was secretly trying to get

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:32.880
 the Jacobites back onto the English throne and that she was kind of slightly sympathetic to the

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:40.640
 Catholics. It was a real kind of time where the monarchy was losing a lot of its power and Parliament

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.960
 was kind of coming in. I think that's why we don't hear much about her. It got called the Age of

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:50.800
 Party. Wow, that sounds cool. Well, yeah, it was... Unfortunately, it was the Age of the Wigs and

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:56.080
 the Tories, as opposed to everyone having a good time. I was thinking it was Gatsby style.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:01.200
 Poor time travellers who read that said, "Let's go over there."

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.560
 Everybody stank and there were no parties.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:13.280
 Nursery rhymes. Yeah, let's do it. Okay. There always seems to be,

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:20.400
 James has mentioned, there's a lot of debunked stories about the origins of nursery rhymes.

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:26.080
 And I'm sure that some of them have been retconned into the nursery rhymes themselves.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:31.760
 The Grand Old Duke of York is clearly about a failed military campaign, but there is about a

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:39.680
 dozen different ideas of who it's talking about. Who's the current Duke of York? Oh, I don't remember.

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:48.240
 Anyway, Pop Goes the Weasel. I really like that one. I love Pop Goes the Weasel.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.080
 That one actually is about Prince Andrew. Yeah.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:57.040
 No one really knows what it means, what Pop Goes the Weasel is.

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:01.920
 There's a lot of copy rhyming slang in there, though, and references to the city road and

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:05.040
 the eagle on the city road, which is actually still there, the pub.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:10.240
 It is, and it has like a side on the side of the building, doesn't it, with the nursery rhyme on it.

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:16.240
 But yeah, so weasel could be your weasel and stout, your throat. So it's like, "Get it down,

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:21.360
 your weasel, mate, when you give someone a pint of beer. Get it down your weasel."

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:26.880
 Or your weasel could be a coat. So there's an idea that it's about putting your coat into the

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:34.240
 pawn shop to pay off all your debts. And any time a new expense comes in, Pop Goes the Weasel,

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:40.320
 there goes your coat again. So yeah, it's a really good cockney knees up.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:45.120
 But what I really like about it is in the 1850s, it was like a dance craze,

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:50.240
 Pop Goes the Weasel. So if you were a time traveller and you wanted to find a real good

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:55.120
 party, then you want to go to 1850s London because you're going to know the dance.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:59.920
 You're going to absolutely smash it. You can go into your music hall and you just dance around.

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:03.840
 And then at the end of it, everyone shouts out, "Pop Goes the Weasel!"

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:08.800
 And that's kind of the big sort of ending of every verse. And it was absolutely massive.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.200
 The baby shark of its day.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:12.800
 So adults were doing this?

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:18.880
 Adults were doing it, yeah. There was an advertisement in the Bath Chronicle in 1853

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:23.920
 that offered instruction to the highly fashionable dance of Pop Goes the Weasel.

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:28.800
 So you could pay people to teach you how to do the Pop Goes the Weasel dance.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:33.040
 And even then, no one really knew what it meant. It was just like a nonsense phrase, really.

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:37.120
 But yeah, it's just like us loving the Macarena. I don't know what the hell that means,

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:43.760
 but it's a dancer. I haven't dedicated myself to understanding the lyrics.

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.520
 I think it's about a lady called Macarena.

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:49.440
 It's about a lady whose husband has gone away and she's

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:54.240
 courting all the other local boys because her boyfriend isn't there anymore.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:59.200
 500 years from now, people will be saying, "Actually, the Macarena is about..."

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.400
 Actually, it's about Brexit.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:08.480
 I love it. Do you guys remember the one that goes, "Do your ears hang low?

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.560
 Do they wobble too and throw back kids' song?"

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:13.040
 We said, "Can you tie them in a bow?" I think.

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.160
 Yeah, "Can you tie them in a..."

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.040
 And actually, I think it was, "Do your boobs hang low? Do your ears hang low?"

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.200
 Well, I think it's, "Do your balls hang low?"

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:23.280
 "Do your balls and do your boobs are the sort of the rude versions of it."

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:27.520
 But the assumption is that it was the kids' song, "Do your ears hang low?"

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:30.160
 And then when you got sort of rude kids at school going,

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.760
 "Have you heard this version?" You would sing it.

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:34.400
 Anyway, it turns out that the original versions were,

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.640
 "Do your balls hang low and do your boobs hang low?"

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:40.080
 And then it got sort of turned into a more presentable for kids,

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:41.200
 "Do your ears hang low?"

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.720
 So it was sung in wartime during World War I on the Western Front.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:48.640
 They would be singing it in the trenches, "Do your balls hang low?"

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:51.040
 And then, "Do the sailor's hornpipe." Yeah.

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.600
 Right. "Do your balls hang low? Can you swing them through?

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.840
 Can you tie them in a knot? Can you tie them in a bow?

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.640
 Can you tuck them to the ceiling with that free and easy feeling?"

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:03.280
 Anyway, it goes, "That's amazing."

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.800
 It's true. I've never heard that version. I don't think so.

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:09.760
 That's the only one. I like that one as a child. Yeah?

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.760
 These things just stay with you, don't they?

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:14.240
 Along with, you know, Margaret Thatcher, "She's our hero."

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:20.160
 Okay. We went to very different schools.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.200
 Gave everyone in the classroom a black armband when she resigned.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.520
 Have you heard of telltale tit? This is a really short one.

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.840
 Telltale tit, "Your tongue shall be slit,

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:34.240
 and all the dogs in the town shall have a little bit."

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:37.280
 So I'd never heard that before, but it's very common in Bolton, I can say.

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:40.400
 Yeah. All the dogs in Bolton will have a little bit.

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.080
 But I just think that's amazing.

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.160
 It's because it's basically a children's equivalent

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.320
 of saying snitches get stitches. Yeah.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:49.200
 Yeah? Telltale tit, "Your tongue will split,

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.120
 and all the little doggies will have a little bit."

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.120
 That's what it used to say. It's terrifying.

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:55.840
 Do you guys know Pissabed? No.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:15:01.680
 It goes, "Pissabed, Pissabed, Barley, but your bum is so heavy, you can't get up."

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:09.600
 And this was published in the very first nursery rhyme songbook

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:12.000
 that was printed in Britain in 1744.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.560
 It's the first time that Ba Ba Blacksheep was ever printed in a nursery rhyme book.

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:18.800
 So it was called Tommy Thumb's Pretty Songbook.

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:22.080
 And we thought there was only one copy that was left,

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:25.200
 which was held, I think, in the British Library.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.120
 But one went up for auction a few years ago.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:30.000
 So there might be a couple more out there.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 But it had 40 nursery rhymes in it.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.360
 And all the classics, Ba Ba Blacksheep, Hickory Dickory Dock,

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.640
 London Bridge is Falling Down, Mary Mary's Quite Contrary.

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:39.840
 This thing, a song with six pence.

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:41.280
 And then Pissabed.

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:42.800
 Tommy Thumb's Pretty Songbook.

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.880
 They were actually all about Pretty Patel, weren't they?

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:53.760
 That's where that name came from.

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:56.080
 OK, it is time for fact number two.

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.920
 And that is Andy.

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:02.400
 My fact is that in 1862, there was a special cravat invented

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:04.800
 to stop people strangling you in the street.

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:12.640
 So if I went to strangle you, Andy, with this, my hands go for your neck.

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:16.560
 Is it that the cravat is so full of folds and so on,

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.320
 I can never actually find your neck?

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.360
 How does it work?

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.120
 It's a real pencil neck, yeah.

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.920
 No, it's got spikes on the inside.

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:24.960
 So you could go for the neck.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:24.960
 On the inside?

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:26.320
 But you get a pretty nasty--

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:26.800
 Oh, sorry.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:31.280
 The spikes are on the outside.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:32.240
 Oh, right, OK.

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:33.760
 Concealed by a layer of cloth.

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.920
 Don't put that on the wrong way round.

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:40.160
 No, you're right.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:40.800
 You're right, you're right.

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:41.760
 Sorry, they're on the outside.

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:44.880
 But they're cleverly concealed by the ruffles at the front of the cravat.

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:49.520
 And so Dan, as soon as you probably try and put your thumbs around my windpipe,

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:51.840
 nice try mate, you're going to get a spiky thumb.

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:57.120
 I also read that some of them had razor blades sewn into the folds as well.

00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:01.360
 Yeah, pretty intense items of clothing.

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:06.320
 And these were designed to fight the menace of garrottings,

00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:07.760
 because there was a panic.

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:12.320
 In fact, there were two panics in the mid-19th century about garrottings.

00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:17.200
 One in 1856, and then it sort of flared up again in 1862.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:22.160
 And there was this massive panic about actually a relatively small crime wave

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.200
 of people being mugged.

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:28.320
 And the method of mugging was someone would grab someone around the throat,

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:30.000
 and then their accomplice would rob them.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.280
 And--

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:36.080
 Yeah, I should just say, like a garrotting to me is like you get some cheese wire or something,

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:40.240
 like in a movie, they would get some wire and they would put it around your throat.

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:42.880
 But this was actually more like putting someone in a sleeper hold

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:44.960
 in like a wrestling move, wasn't it, than--

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:46.400
 Yeah, yeah.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.400
 I mean, it could definitely, it could hurt you very badly.

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.880
 I mean, it could absolutely, it could kill you as well.

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:55.440
 I don't think very many people at all were actually killed by this.

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:58.560
 But it led to a change in the law.

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:01.520
 The parliament passed the 1863 Garottas Act.

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:04.640
 And yeah, this was a big panic.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:08.880
 There is an argument that not only did not many people die of this,

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:09.920
 no people died of it.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.280
 And it was completely made up.

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:12.160
 Yeah, absolutely.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.480
 So there's an argument that it was completely made up by newspapers.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:16.800
 So there was an MP who got mugged.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.600
 He was called Hugh Pilkington, and he had his pocket watch stolen.

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:24.480
 And they said that he was garrotted when they stole his watch.

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.760
 But actually, it seems like he wasn't really.

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:31.360
 And then basically, newspapers started calling any minor instant.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:32.800
 They said, oh, this was a garrotting.

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:37.520
 And then some of the magistrates would say that it was a garrotting,

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:40.640
 even though it wasn't, because they knew that the person would get more time

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.560
 or a stronger punishment for it.

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:48.640
 And then after the 1863 Act, there was no more garrottings.

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:50.960
 But the argument among historians, a lot of them,

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.640
 is that there were never any in the first place.

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:56.240
 It's very much what's it in the Simpsons,

00:18:56.240 --> 00:19:00.160
 where it's like this rock scares away tigers or whatever it is.

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:01.600
 Yeah, right.

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:02.560
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:04.800
 But there were descriptions of how it worked.

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:06.880
 So it would be a three-person gang,

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:11.520
 which consisted of a front stall, a back stall, and the nasty man.

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:12.320
 OK, so.

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:15.120
 Tag yourself.

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:21.600
 I think the front stall distracts you.

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.680
 He stops you and says, oh, excuse me, do you have the time.

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:25.200
 And then the back stall is the lookout,

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:27.440
 who's making sure there are no police coming along.

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:30.800
 And the nasty man is the one who actually does the garrotting.

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:32.640
 I could have worked that out.

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:33.120
 Oh, OK.

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:39.120
 There was another thing you could buy in 1858,

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:43.280
 a guy called Henry Boll invented a pistol one on your back,

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.680
 which would discharge into a criminal's crotch.

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:47.440
 I love this.

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:50.560
 That would go, I suppose that would go for the back man, would it?

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:53.760
 Oh, yeah, that would be to take the back stall.

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:54.160
 Yeah.

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:54.400
 Yeah.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:58.160
 Well, no, the grotter is going around you with the sleepball, right?

00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:58.880
 Oh, good point.

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.480
 So that's for the nasty man here.

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:01.360
 Yeah, that's nasty man.

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:02.720
 Wow.

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.800
 I think I can't believe this was a real thing.

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:05.520
 Did that work?

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:06.960
 Did anyone?

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:08.480
 I'm not sure any of this stuff was.

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:10.320
 No, this is a real thing.

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:11.520
 It was real, sorry.

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:14.320
 It was real, but I don't think everyone was wearing them.

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:15.200
 You know, it was kind of.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:15.200
 Right.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.840
 Wow.

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:20.080
 Imagine that you're going out just to the local pub,

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.840
 you're wearing spikes around your neck,

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.680
 you've got a pistol facing backwards.

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.320
 I mean, Jesus, what a look.

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:27.520
 This gun sounds amazing,

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.920
 because it looks just like a little belt pack, doesn't it?

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:31.760
 And you, but the thing is, obviously,

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.760
 you had guns weren't that advanced yet.

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:37.680
 So apparently you had to reach back to cock the hammer of the gun.

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:41.520
 And then you had to kind of pull a ripcord at your waistline,

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:44.880
 which would actually fire the gun and fire a lead ball into your attackers.

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.240
 It would be recoil.

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:48.160
 Like normally recoil goes in one direction,

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.360
 but if it's firing there,

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:51.760
 you would just be kind of thrusting your crotch forward,

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:52.400
 wouldn't you?

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.560
 Like whenever you fired this gun.

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.640
 Yeah, you would get blasted into the front stall.

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:58.880
 So you're a kind of human cannonball.

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:02.320
 The nasty man's nowhere to be seen.

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:04.720
 It's so amazing.

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.640
 The Henry Ball Belt Pistol, I love it.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.960
 Oh, you could just hire some bodyguards

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.760
 to walk you to and from the pub,

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:14.800
 like the Bayswater Brothers who advertised.

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:18.320
 The Bayswater Brothers whose height is respected

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:20.880
 with six feet four inches and six feet 11,

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.400
 and the United Breadth of whose shoulders

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:25.360
 extends to as much as three yards, one foot five inches.

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.440
 Give respectfully notice to the gentry and public

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.440
 of Paddington, Kensington, Stoke, Newington,

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.280
 Chelsea, Eaton Square, and Sheppard's Bush

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:32.560
 that they will be most happy

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:35.280
 upon all social and jovial expeditions

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:37.680
 to escort elderly or nervous persons

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:38.960
 in the streets after dark.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.680
 Wow, they sound great.

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:45.040
 So they'd served several months in the police force

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:48.000
 and they would go through any neighborhood,

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.040
 even the worst grotting district well known.

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:53.200
 Yeah, but they don't go south of the river, do they?

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:54.080
 Typical.

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.680
 It's just like cabbies all over again.

00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:58.240
 No, grotting south of the river.

00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.360
 Wow.

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:02.880
 Some more kind of panics.

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.080
 Oh, yeah.

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:08.640
 Because I'm saying that this grotting wasn't really a thing.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.040
 It might have been a thing, but that's the kind of angle I'm taking.

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:13.040
 It's definitely a way smaller thing than

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:16.400
 the 1863 Garottas Act would suggest.

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:22.560
 In 1954, a load of people in Seattle were really worried

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:24.560
 because there were loads of holes in their windscreens.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.040
 And everyone was going out looking at their car

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:30.080
 and they find little holes and they didn't know what had happened.

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:31.840
 They thought it was vandals.

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.400
 They thought it might have been fallout from nuclear tests

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:37.760
 that were happening, to be honest, not that close to Seattle,

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:39.360
 but they thought maybe it was that.

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:42.480
 And then a load of scientists were brought in

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:44.080
 and they looked at what had happened.

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:48.160
 And it turned out that these pits were there all along,

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:51.680
 but it was just happened that in that year, 1954,

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:54.000
 someone noticed it and then everyone else went,

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.360
 "Oh my God, I've got that as well."

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.040
 "Oh my God, I've got that as well."

00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:58.480
 That's very funny, that's so weird.

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:02.320
 Yeah, in 1788, you have the London Monster.

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.280
 Oh, yeah.

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:03.920
 Oh, yes.

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:06.640
 Who was a guy who went around basically

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:10.320
 stabbing ladies in the skirt area,

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:13.040
 ripping their clothes.

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:16.240
 Sometimes he'd be presenting them with flowers

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:19.360
 and there'd be something sharp concealed within them.

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:19.840
 Oh, no.

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:22.880
 Yeah, it was a disgrace.

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.280
 But it probably didn't happen.

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:27.520
 Oh, okay, roll a question.

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:30.080
 There were up to 50 women reported to the police

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:30.960
 that they'd been attacked.

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:34.320
 And it was like approving that some of these women

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:36.000
 had inflicted wounds themselves.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.880
 They were just scratched or they just ripped the dress.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:41.200
 But somebody did get convicted.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:45.200
 A woman was attacked in the January, I think, of 1790.

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:51.600
 And she saw a guy in the park six months later,

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:53.120
 got a boyfriend to follow him home.

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:58.400
 It was this ex-Ballet dancer who now made artificial flowers,

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:02.800
 this Welsh guy, who got up before the beak

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:06.560
 and they found out that the worst offence they could charge him with

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:08.560
 was actually damaging clothes.

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:08.880
 Oh, right.

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:14.960
 Apparently they're damaging clothes under the law at the time

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:19.200
 because their expensive foreign clothes came with a harsher penalty

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:22.960
 than actually injuring these women attempting murder and stabbing.

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:26.240
 So eventually this guy got six years,

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:29.120
 but mysteriously there were no attacks after that,

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:31.680
 even though he probably wasn't the attacker.

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:33.600
 But during a two-year period,

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:36.960
 women started wearing copper pans under their petticoats

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:41.040
 as a form of self-defense against the London monster.

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:46.080
 So there's a James Gilray engraving of the monster

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:48.000
 attacking a woman in a pulsa pescat

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.120
 and there's just a pan there, so he's disappointed.

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:52.000
 Yeah, well, you would be.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.360
 Thank you.

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:58.720
 Did you say this was 1788 that this was happening?

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:01.760
 1788 it started, yeah, to 1790.

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:06.000
 I didn't think there were people making artificial flowers in the 1780s.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000
 Yeah, they'd be made of silk, I would guess, rather than...

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.240
 Yeah, I just sort of assumed that they were a thing from the '70s onwards,

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:15.280
 like kind of like plastic or...

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:16.240
 I can't believe that.

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:18.320
 Is that what you got out of that story, Andy?

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:19.760
 Apparently, apparently, yes.

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:23.200
 In the earliest, earliest days of this podcast,

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:26.560
 I mentioned a fact about the precursor to the London monster,

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:28.640
 which was a man who used to go around London

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:31.520
 and he would slap women on the bum and then he would run off

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:33.600
 and as he ran off, he would yell, "Spanko!"

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:38.640
 I think he was called whipping Tom or something like that.

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:41.440
 Can I just say with that, I think in that case,

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:44.880
 if you had a copper pan in your petticoats,

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:46.560
 then it would have the opposite effect,

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:48.880
 because it would make a really nice resonant sound

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.080
 if you spanked someone and they were like...

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:51.280
 Yeah, absolutely.

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:53.120
 ...a copper pot there, wouldn't it?

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:53.680
 That's true.

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:54.960
 Like playing the timpani.

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:56.880
 That would be like the J. Arthur rank symbol

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:58.400
 at the beginning of films, wouldn't it?

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.120
 It's a spanko running on,

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.520
 hitting a petticoat and running off.

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:06.400
 So was he caught?

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:07.280
 Dan, was he caught?

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:09.600
 Do we know who the real Spanko was?

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:11.360
 Oh, Spanko? No, I don't know any...

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:12.960
 I just... That's an old memory,

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.720
 as Jenny was talking about the London monster.

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.000
 He was a precursor.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.800
 But yeah, amazing character, the London monster.

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:21.680
 And huge panic off the back of that.

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:25.360
 Oh yeah, if James Gilray is doing engravings of you,

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:26.640
 then you know you've made it.

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:27.040
 Yeah.

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:28.800
 I don't know James Gilray.

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:30.800
 Was he Mr. Engraver back then?

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:31.680
 Oh, he was Mr...

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:35.120
 You know, your political cartoons, those are all him.

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:38.000
 You know, he's the Steve Bell of his day.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.200
 I didn't know who it was either,

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.560
 but I thought by keeping quiet,

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:41.760
 people would assume that I did.

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:46.480
 You've definitely, definitely 100% seen his work.

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:46.800
 Okay.

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:50.080
 Yeah, there are all the really big complicated drawings

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:52.480
 where people have to be labelled quite precisely.

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:54.640
 So, you know, there's a brilliant engraving.

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:55.680
 I'm just making this up now,

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:58.000
 but you know, there'll be a monkey and a hot-air balloon,

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.840
 but the monkey has to be labelled

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:01.520
 Britain's response to the Eritrean.

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:05.760
 And the balloon is labelled European integration

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:07.280
 after the 1763 act of...

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:10.640
 Oh, I don't get this at all.

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:16.160
 But back in the day, people have one glanced at it like,

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.680
 "Yeah, I've got it like, like... "Brilliant art.

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:19.840
 "Marius, the Montaginius."

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:27.840
 Okay, it's time for fact number three,

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:29.840
 and that is James.

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:33.280
 Okay, my fact this week is that for 24 years,

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:37.440
 any ship travelling between Wellington and Nelson in New Zealand

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:40.320
 would be guided through the most dangerous section

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:42.720
 by a dolphin called "Pelarous Jack".

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:45.600
 I should have done that in a pirate voice,

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:46.560
 shouldn't I?

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:50.560
 Would be guided through the most dangerous section

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:53.280
 by a dolphin called "Pelarous Jack".

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:54.720
 Is that better? No.

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:57.600
 I couldn't tell the difference.

00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:03.040
 So, James, what north is this?

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:04.480
 This is a fact.

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:05.920
 Okay.

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:06.720
 Perhaps.

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:11.280
 So, at the north end of New Zealand's South Island,

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:13.040
 there's a little stretch of water.

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:14.240
 It's really, really perilous.

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:16.240
 It's called the French Pass,

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:21.120
 and there are loads of really bad currents and high waves,

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:22.960
 and it could be really difficult to get through.

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:26.480
 And at the turn of the 20th century,

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.560
 any boat that was going through there

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:31.520
 would always have this dolphin alongside it.

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:34.560
 Now, whether the dolphin was deliberately helping

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:35.520
 the humans across,

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:38.160
 or whether it was just being a dolphin

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:41.520
 and kind of swimming in the wake of a boat,

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:43.360
 like dolphins often do, we don't know.

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:44.400
 Well, we do know,

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:46.160
 because it didn't even know it was a dolphin.

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:48.000
 It was just a goat.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:48.560
 But what is true...

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.080
 But it was there. It was there, right?

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:51.920
 It was there, and people believed

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:53.200
 that that's what was happening.

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.440
 So, people were writing at the time,

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:58.160
 there's articles from 1905, 1906,

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:00.560
 where people said they were on this boat,

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:03.760
 and the dolphin was acting as a pilot for the ships,

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:05.840
 and that it would take them deliberately

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:08.160
 into the areas where the water was deeper,

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:10.320
 because it knew there would be less chance

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:13.360
 of the boat being smashed on the rocks.

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:17.280
 And then, some people didn't like the dolphin being there,

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:18.880
 and some people shot at it.

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:21.600
 On one particular time, when someone shot this dolphin,

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:23.680
 there was a law that came up that said

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:26.480
 you are specifically not allowed to shoot

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:29.120
 this particular dolphin in New Zealand,

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:30.960
 and it was the first sea creature

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:33.600
 to be protected by law anywhere in the world.

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:36.480
 I mean, between this and the 1863 Garotas Act,

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:39.440
 it does feel like legislators had a lot more time on their hands

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:40.240
 back in the day.

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:45.760
 But so, the story goes that the boat,

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:50.080
 the ship that shot at Jack was called the SS Penguin,

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:52.720
 and the story goes that he disappeared,

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:55.520
 and he came back later, but five years later,

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:58.720
 the SS Penguin struck rocks and sank,

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:03.200
 and 75 passengers perished, and as the story goes,

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:06.560
 it's because Jack, when he saw the SS Penguin coming,

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:07.360
 would ignore it.

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:09.440
 He knew that that was the boat that shot him,

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:11.600
 and so, maybe without his help,

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:14.800
 that's what led to it being slammed into the rocks.

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:15.760
 It's a great story. I love it.

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:16.080
 I should leave it.

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:19.040
 "Pellaris" is a really weird name,

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:21.520
 because I thought when you said that the French Pass,

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:23.360
 this strait of water was very perilous,

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:24.960
 I thought, oh, maybe it's a burden of that.

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:25.520
 I don't think it is.

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:26.080
 It's not, no.

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:27.920
 It's a ship's instrument or something?

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:31.760
 There was a ship called the HMS Pellaris,

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:34.800
 and there's a Pellaris, sorry,

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:37.200
 and it kind of went around that area of New Zealand

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:39.520
 and Australia, so there's a Pellaris Island as well,

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:41.440
 and a few different things named after Pellaris,

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:44.080
 which was this discovery ship.

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:45.520
 Okay.

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:49.920
 But Pellaris was also the name of Hannibal's pilot,

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:51.920
 so that may be where it comes from.

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:52.560
 Hannibal.

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:53.360
 Hannibal Lecter.

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:58.240
 Yeah, Hannibal Lecter needed a pilot to take him around to eat people.

00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:59.760
 You've got to have a private pilot.

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:01.120
 You're a busy man.

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:03.280
 These livers aren't going to cook themselves.

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:06.800
 Do you mean Hannibal as in the...?

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:08.720
 Hannibal as in the elephant dude.

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:09.600
 The elephant dude.

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:10.800
 Carthaginian general.

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:11.440
 Elephant dude.

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.120
 Now sounds like we're talking about the elephant man,

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:14.720
 who is a different person to Hannibal.

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:17.520
 That elephant dude would definitely be the name

00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:19.280
 of Hannibal's YouTube channel, wouldn't it?

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:23.120
 We're going to try and take some elephants

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:24.160
 and invade Rome next week.

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:25.600
 It's going to be completely crazy.

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:27.920
 Hit like and subscribe to see if it works.

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:32.480
 But yeah, there was, when I sent this fact round,

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:37.280
 Andy, you found an article that said that perhaps it wasn't real,

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:41.920
 and that the fact that the people thought that Dolphin was guiding

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:44.480
 people was invented quite a few years later.

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:49.840
 But I found an article from April 1905,

00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:52.640
 where there was a guy called Mr. Generous Hayes,

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:54.560
 who said that...

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:56.560
 No, not...

00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:59.120
 Definitely not made up.

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:03.120
 What date in April, James?

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:07.600
 It was the 29th of April,

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:09.920
 but this story had come all the way from Australia,

00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:11.920
 so it could definitely take 28 days

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:14.720
 to get to the central Somerset Gazette,

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:15.840
 which is where I read it.

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:21.200
 But he said that Jack acts as a most effective pilot,

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:24.480
 escorting all kinds of vessels in and out of the French Pass.

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:26.480
 Yeah, and he was sort of globally famous.

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:29.600
 There's stories of Mark Twain specifically going on that route

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:30.240
 to see him.

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:31.040
 Wow.

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:33.120
 Yeah, and another, an English author

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:34.560
 called Frank T. Bullen as well.

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:36.560
 Both had written about it.

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:39.680
 So, yeah, I think the contentious thing is,

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:41.920
 was he piloting them or was he just having fun?

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:42.880
 In real.

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:44.400
 But there's photos and so on.

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:45.920
 I must say, every time I read that,

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:46.960
 I read that in a few places,

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:50.400
 and it always said well-known figures such as Mark Twain

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.400
 and English author Frank T. Bullen.

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:55.760
 And I always thought, one of those I have heard of, for sure.

00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:59.200
 I saw, when I saw New Zealand,

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:01.120
 I obviously got in touch with my friend,

00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:06.560
 who's an ex-pat Kiwi, Amy, and I messaged her and I said,

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:07.760
 "Have you heard of Pellaris Jack?"

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:09.680
 And she went, "Oh my God, I love him.

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:12.080
 "He's a celebrity dolphin in New Zealand."

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:14.240
 And I was like, "A celebrity dolphin."

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:17.360
 And there's more than one celebrity dolphin in New Zealand.

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:19.680
 It's a thing, and they all have statues.

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:25.120
 So, there's Oppo, who was famous in New Zealand

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:28.000
 during the summer of 1955 to '56,

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:30.240
 because he played with children,

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:35.360
 and very soon after, he'd become stranded and died.

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:37.120
 So, that's a cheery story.

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:39.520
 Well, his full name was Oppo-Ni-Jack, wasn't it?

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:40.480
 Yeah, Oppo-Ni-Jack.

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:41.520
 Oh, wow. Sorry.

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:44.880
 Pellaris Jack himself, because he's the archetype

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:47.120
 of celebrity dolphins in New Zealand, obviously.

00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:56.240
 And then Mokko came around in 2006 to do a similar kind of thing.

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:58.320
 But, you know, neither of them was that useful.

00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:59.120
 They weren't guiding.

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:02.320
 They were just kind of interhumans, so became quite famous.

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:05.840
 Mokko was a guide on one famous occasion,

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:09.200
 because, again, another Kiwi dolphin.

00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:12.480
 In 2008, there were two pygmy sperm whales who were trapped.

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:14.800
 I think they were trapped between the beach

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:16.720
 and a sand bank that was built up.

00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:18.080
 But they didn't know what to do,

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:20.400
 and the authorities were saying,

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:22.640
 "Oh, well, should we kill them?

00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:24.240
 "Because otherwise, they're going to really suffer,

00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:25.120
 "and they might die."

00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:29.600
 And Mokko the dolphin led them out through a narrow channel

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.920
 at the end of the sand bank that they were in,

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:32.800
 so there was a bit of water

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:34.720
 that was just deep enough to get these whales through.

00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:37.200
 So, obviously, it became a huge celebrity,

00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:40.400
 and then it all went to his head, and he started sexually...

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:41.760
 Doing a lot of cocaine.

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:44.000
 Well, he started sexually assaulting swimmers,

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.800
 and I know it is, you know, celebrity excess.

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:51.680
 He started making what was called amorous advances

00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:54.240
 to women in the water, and also just being a bit of a thug.

00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:56.080
 He started tipping over water skiers,

00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:57.120
 and I can't believe this,

00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:59.440
 but apparently stealing surfers' surfboards?

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:01.280
 Now, I don't know...

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:03.360
 I can't envisage how a dolphin does that.

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:05.360
 Why do you need to?

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.760
 You're already quite efficient in the water.

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:09.600
 I mean...

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:13.360
 For a dolphin, a surfboard might be like a hoverboard for a human.

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:14.880
 Like, he might...

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:15.520
 Oh, yeah.

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:17.120
 Can you imagine if you're a dolphin

00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:18.560
 and one of your mates comes along

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:21.040
 and he's just kind of lying on a surfboard?

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:22.400
 That guy is cool.

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:23.280
 He's chilling.

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:25.600
 OK, so James is trying to justify Mokko's crime wave.

00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:28.960
 You Mokko apologist.

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:32.720
 But he still has a statue, though.

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:34.320
 They are all blooming statues, yeah.

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:34.880
 Wow.

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:37.440
 Going to commemorate your local celebrity dolphin.

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:39.760
 That didn't get pulled down in the whole recent...

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:42.000
 It might be re-evaluated.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.880
 You know who also seems to be into New Zealand dolphins?

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:48.400
 Is the Scottish.

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:52.160
 So, it's just a very curious thing,

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:57.920
 but Perilous Jack was turned into a song and a dance in Scotland.

00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:02.000
 And so there's a song that goes...

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.600
 And I don't know the music to it,

00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:06.720
 but a famous fish there used to be called Pelerous Jack.

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:09.280
 He'd always swim far out to sea when a ship came back.

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:14.080
 And this got turned into a dance which you could do.

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:16.560
 And there's a move called the dolphin hay,

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:18.640
 which I guess is a bit like the pop goes the weasel.

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:21.200
 It's sort of like a dolphin move.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.280
 So that was turned into a dance,

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:26.080
 and there's a full dance routine about Pelerous Jack,

00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:28.160
 but also Oppo, who we were talking about,

00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:32.000
 in 1994 was also turned into a Scottish dance as well.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.680
 Yeah.

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:36.080
 So, if you go to Scotland,

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:39.360
 likely there are people who know two New Zealand dolphin dances.

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:41.440
 Well, Dan, I've got some ends

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:44.000
 with the Scottish country dancing community,

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.080
 and I can confirm there's no shortage of things

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:47.120
 they've named dances after.

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:51.440
 There are so many hundreds of dances that I'm kind of...

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:55.040
 And they're just going through Wikipedia on random pages

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:57.040
 and going, "Okay, well, I'm going to do this

00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:00.000
 after George Washington High School in Milwaukee."

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.520
 It is amazing the number of things they have done so now after.

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:06.480
 Yeah, very cool.

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:09.120
 I think it must be an extension of the nursery rhyme thing.

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:12.560
 So Scottish country dancing has taken up the mantle.

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:15.360
 Have you ever done any Scottish country dancing?

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:15.840
 What, me?

00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:16.400
 Yeah.

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.520
 Yeah, yeah, I've done a bit.

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:18.800
 Yeah, it's great.

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:20.160
 It's really, really fun.

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:21.600
 Do you know the dolphin hay?

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:23.680
 I don't know the dolphin hay, no.

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:26.240
 I'm not off the top of your head, but...

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:27.760
 Thousands of dances, Dan.

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:31.040
 It's not entry level, anyway.

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:32.080
 No, absolutely not.

00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:34.640
 That's a dashing white sergeant is the first thing you learn.

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:36.000
 I think you have to be pretty...

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.120
 You have to be balls deep

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:39.280
 before you learn the dolphin hay off by heart.

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:43.120
 Did you do country dancing at school?

00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:44.000
 No, I didn't.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.120
 Jenny, did you?

00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:48.080
 I remember a couple of sessions of it

00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:50.960
 when they didn't have a PE teacher.

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:55.840
 Emergency country dance.

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:58.080
 It was raining, and so a teacher,

00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:00.160
 he happened to know some country dancing.

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:02.400
 Oh, OK, so you didn't have a dance instructor

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:06.400
 who'd been kept in a cupboard for years until the PE teacher fell ill.

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:08.400
 Because when I was at primary school,

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:10.320
 so Jenny and I went to the same secondary school,

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:11.760
 but when I was at primary school,

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:14.320
 we did country dancing every week.

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:14.720
 Wow.

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:16.800
 Was it English country dancing you were doing?

00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:18.880
 It's like Morris dancing, I guess.

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:22.640
 It's like, all I remember is that you had to dozee-doh your partner.

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:24.320
 Yeah, that's all I remember.

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:25.680
 All I remember is dozee-doh.

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:28.640
 There is one dance that's an English country dance,

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:31.680
 and English country dancing's a bit rarer for whatever reason.

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:32.800
 There are still loads of dances,

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:34.000
 but they just don't get danced as much,

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.840
 because they're all from Jane Austen's time.

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:38.560
 But there's one which is called Mr. Beveridge's Maggot.

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:41.280
 It's my favourite name of a dance.

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:43.680
 That's wonderful.

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:44.640
 That's absolutely wonderful.

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:46.080
 And what happens at the end of that?

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:48.160
 Um, I don't know.

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:50.480
 I don't know if this was named after an actual maggot

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:52.480
 that was like a celebrity maggot,

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:56.560
 which saved a carriage from crashing or whatever.

00:38:56.560 --> 00:39:01.040
 I don't know what to go from there.

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:02.560
 Dolphins?

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:04.000
 Let's talk about dolphins.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:04.720
 Yeah, yes.

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:09.200
 One thing that dolphins do, which I didn't know,

00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:12.560
 is that they can wear gloves over their noses.

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:16.160
 Okay, well, this is amazing.

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:20.400
 Andy, is this a real glove over a nose,

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:22.960
 or is this an analogy for a glove over a nose?

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:25.600
 Because Sarah Pascoe called us out last week,

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:29.680
 if you remember, about this ladybird bought a hat.

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:32.560
 And then it's never an actual hat.

00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:35.680
 Oh my god, I've fallen right into the Pascoe ladybird hat trap,

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:37.120
 because no, it's not a glove.

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:38.480
 It's not a glove. Obviously, it's not a glove.

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:39.120
 What is it?

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:41.360
 They, so, you know, marine sponges.

00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:45.360
 They're animals, technically, aren't they?

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:47.040
 The sponges are very simple animals.

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:50.640
 They kind of pick up these sponges,

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:53.280
 and they press them onto the end of their snouts.

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:56.000
 And then when they're foraging, they're using their snout,

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.160
 and they are probing for prey sometimes

00:39:58.160 --> 00:39:59.760
 under the surface of the sea.

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:01.840
 But there can be sharp things there.

00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:04.560
 And so these sponges on their noses

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:08.480
 act as a kind of bit of protective equipment, if you like,

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:12.960
 to stop them hurting themselves when they're jamming around there.

00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:15.440
 And they particularly pick conical sponges,

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:18.560
 because they can jam them more easily onto the end of their noses.

00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:19.120
 They're nice.

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:19.760
 That's cool.

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:20.320
 Yeah.

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:22.240
 I think glove is acceptable for that,

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:24.160
 because that's basically their hand.

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:26.000
 And they're putting something over the hand

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.080
 so they can go rippling about in things.

00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:30.640
 So, yeah, I'll accept it.

00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:32.160
 I'm not going to Pascoe you on this.

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:34.000
 I don't know.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.240
 If James hadn't called Andy out just then,

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:37.360
 I would be at parties going,

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:39.360
 "You know they wear marigolds on their face?"

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.160
 Dolphins can talk to each other on the telephone.

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:46.080
 Jesus Christ.

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:46.400
 OK.

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:50.000
 I think we all want to Pascoe you on this one.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.840
 Well, there was an aquarium in Hawaii

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:56.480
 where they had the mother in a separate tank,

00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:59.360
 to a two-year-old calf dolphin.

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:04.320
 And they organised an audio link between the two tanks

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:06.560
 and got them chatting to each other.

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:08.800
 And the calls and responses were in line

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:11.280
 with the kind of calls and responses you would hear in the wild,

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:12.480
 even though they couldn't see each other.

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:13.920
 And they don't know what they said.

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:16.960
 We've spoken about the dolphin dictionary

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:18.800
 that they're working on at the moment, scientists.

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:21.680
 But we do know that they were calling responses

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:22.400
 that were happening.

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:25.280
 And it's sort of, they think the conversation was like,

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:27.760
 "Hey, what's your name? Oh, my name's this. Oh, great.

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:29.600
 There's lots of fish here. Oh, that's good to know."

00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:33.600
 Yeah, so they can chat over the phone.

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:36.240
 OK, actually, again, sounded unreasonable,

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:37.840
 but I think that's completely legit.

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:39.120
 They can chat over the phone.

00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:41.360
 They can't dial, and they can't, you know...

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:42.800
 No.

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:45.120
 They'd have to take the glove off to dial, obviously.

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:51.040
 So, also, dolphins can attack enemies of the Soviet Union.

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:56.080
 Because that's the thing, isn't it?

00:41:56.080 --> 00:42:00.160
 Dolphins, they are trained in various armies.

00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:02.800
 The Americans have done it, and the Soviets did it.

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:05.520
 Their first use of dolphins by the Navy

00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:09.200
 was in 1970 in Vietnam, where they were put on guard duty

00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:11.760
 for the Americans.

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:15.760
 Was that river dolphins, or was it sea going dolphins?

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:19.600
 That's a really good point. I don't know about that.

00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:21.840
 I don't know. It's actually the least relevant part

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:24.160
 of the most amazing fact I've ever heard, obviously.

00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:26.400
 I mean, the dolphins fought in Nam

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:27.680
 is a more interesting factor,

00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:29.520
 whether they were river or ocean dolphins.

00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:31.760
 But you do get river dolphins in Vietnam.

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:34.080
 Yeah, I suspect there'd be river dolphins there,

00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:36.400
 because it was the Mekong Delta and all that.

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:38.800
 So, I'm guessing there would be guarding

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:40.880
 certain entry and exit points.

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:42.800
 Fingers, Andy. You always ask the questions

00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:44.480
 that the people at home are all thinking.

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:53.920
 And the Soviet Union, they used their dolphin guards.

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:56.560
 They would carry a titanium clump on their nose,

00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:58.640
 which was about the size of a ping-pong ball.

00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:02.640
 And they would attach it to a diver that they found.

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:07.280
 And the little kind of thing would report back

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:09.920
 and tell you where that person is, so you'd be able to find them.

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:13.840
 And if they couldn't find them, eventually,

00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:15.520
 the ping-pong ball thing would inject

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:18.480
 a high-pressure charge of CO2 into the diver's body.

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:21.600
 Oh, so this is an enemy diver, is it?

00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:23.520
 Well, like a U.S. diver or whatever.

00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:24.480
 That's the idea, yeah.

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:25.920
 To tag them, and a guard.

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:30.080
 And again, I don't know exactly what species of dolphin it was.

00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:36.800
 [music]

00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:39.440
 OK, it's time for our final fact of the show.

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:40.560
 That is my fact.

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:43.520
 My fact this week is that the Arthakonin Doyle estate

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:46.480
 is currently suing Netflix for showing Sherlock Holmes

00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:49.040
 as having feelings and respecting women.

00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:54.640
 So this is really interesting.

00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:59.040
 So Netflix is making a movie called Enola Holmes,

00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:03.840
 and it is the story of the teenage sister of Sherlock Holmes,

00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:06.160
 and Sherlock Holmes appears as a character in it.

00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:10.000
 And in the show, they show him as having sort of

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.000
 not sociopath qualities that we know Sherlock to have,

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.080
 but to be warmer and gentler.

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:18.960
 And the Conan Doyle estate is claiming

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:20.800
 they are unable to represent him like that,

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:23.760
 because yes, even though Sherlock does have those feelings,

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:26.560
 he did eventually sort of respect women

00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:29.040
 and become a nicer character.

00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:31.680
 He only became that in the last 10 stories

00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:33.840
 that were written by Conan Doyle.

00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:35.920
 And it just so happens that those 10 stories

00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:38.640
 are the only stories that are still in copyright

00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:40.320
 and belong to the Conan Doyle estate.

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:43.280
 So anyone who wants to use the ad of copyright

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:46.400
 has to use the more mean, misogynistic Holmes,

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:47.280
 and they're fine.

00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:49.200
 But if you want to show him being a nice guy,

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:50.400
 you're going to be sued.

00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:50.640
 Wow.

00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:54.320
 There's a few other things that you're not allowed to...

00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:59.120
 Or if you do show Sherlock having these characteristics,

00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:00.960
 then you have to pay them, pay the family.

00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:05.680
 So if you show Holmes and Watson having a genuine friendship,

00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:07.120
 that's in copyright.

00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:10.080
 If you show his love of nature, that is.

00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:14.000
 And if you ever show him liking dogs, that's in copyright.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.480
 So if you ever make...

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:18.000
 I'm just going to say this to everyone out there.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.480
 If you're making your own version of Sherlock Holmes,

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:22.720
 make sure that he doesn't like dogs whenever you do.

00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:22.960
 Yeah.

00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:27.200
 I guess the hand of the basketballs is out of copyright,

00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:28.560
 in which he doesn't like dogs.

00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:29.120
 No.

00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:30.640
 No, it's quite right.

00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:32.560
 And the thing is, if you are going to make

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:34.960
 something where he does like dogs and respects women,

00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:37.840
 all you need to do actually is wait two or three more years,

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:39.120
 because that is...

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:41.760
 We're in the final years of them owning this copyright.

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:44.160
 I think that's why they're trying to rake in as much money

00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:46.640
 as possible, because they're about to lose it entirely.

00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:49.520
 But these stories obviously have...

00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:51.360
 He wrote them over a lifetime.

00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:54.640
 So there's a bit of spread on when the copyright ends.

00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:57.280
 And the final batch, these final 10 were written

00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:59.280
 after he returned from World War I,

00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:00.880
 and he lost his brother in the war,

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:02.240
 he lost his eldest son,

00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:03.760
 and he came back and he was a different man.

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:06.160
 And he thought, "I want to reflect that in Sherlock."

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:08.400
 And so that's why there was this sudden change

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:10.400
 in the attitude of Sherlock.

00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:11.280
 It's interesting.

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:14.240
 Yeah, I got deep into the legalese of all this,

00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:18.160
 because that's my background.

00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:21.040
 So there's actually an in-fight between

00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:24.080
 the Conan Doyle estate limited

00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:26.720
 and Arthur Conan Doyle's literary estates,

00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:32.160
 both of whom claim to have the copyright of those stories.

00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:35.680
 And it's actually the Conan Doyle estate limited

00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:38.880
 is the litigious one of those two.

00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:42.400
 And so they are described by the literary estate

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:46.480
 as copyright trolls, which is a whole new tale.

00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:50.080
 So tracing it back,

00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:53.200
 the way that the story is told by the literary estate

00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:59.040
 is that all the rights were sold after Conan Doyle's death

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:01.760
 because the three inheriting children,

00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:04.480
 so it's two daughters and the widow of his son,

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:08.560
 couldn't agree on anything.

00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:10.080
 So they all sold to the widow.

00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:15.440
 And from then on, she went bankrupt

00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:17.040
 and the rights were acquired by someone else

00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:18.640
 who was acquired by someone else.

00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:20.560
 And so they traced that route back.

00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:26.800
 In 2000-ish, when EU copyright law started to indicate

00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:30.080
 that there wasn't much money left to be squeezed out

00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:32.400
 in Europe of the literary copyright,

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:36.160
 that's when Conan Doyle estate limited,

00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:38.880
 which is some descendants of Conan Doyle himself

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:44.080
 decided to put the squeeze on some of the studios

00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:45.440
 who are interested in his work.

00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:48.160
 So they basically went and threatened Warner Brothers

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:51.200
 when they made the Robert Downey Jr. versions.

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:55.280
 And because in those films,

00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:57.680
 he's got a romance with Irene Adler.

00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:00.480
 There's all that sort of stuff that would come under

00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:02.880
 the sort of stipulations.

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:05.680
 And the...

00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:07.680
 I think it would be fair to threaten those filmmakers

00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:10.160
 actually at the Robert Downey Jr. Sherlock Holmes

00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:11.360
 in the game of Thanos movie.

00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:14.400
 No, the people you want to threaten

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:15.920
 are the people who made Holmes and Watson.

00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:18.000
 What? Oh, sorry.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.960
 This is Dad's favourite film, The Will's Feral Sherlock Holmes.

00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:21.760
 It's so good.

00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:26.400
 Yeah, but nowhere in Holmes is he bloody hilarious.

00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:27.280
 I think, oh, true.

00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:28.080
 There you go.

00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:30.320
 So that's actually more of a divergence

00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:31.440
 from the original text.

00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:34.400
 And I'm guessing that that studio paid them off.

00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:39.200
 Do you know the, obviously, the very famous quote,

00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:40.480
 "elementary, my dear Watson?"

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:46.160
 It never said in any of the written work of Conan Doyle's.

00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:48.720
 So it's a line that came much later.

00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:51.680
 But there's someone who runs a site called Quote Investigator

00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:53.200
 who's written a fantastic article

00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:55.920
 about trying to find the very first instances

00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:58.640
 where we use "elementary, my dear Watson."

00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:02.000
 And the oldest that he could find was 1901,

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.200
 the Northampton Mercury.

00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:06.160
 They published a short parody featuring the characters

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:08.320
 Shylock Combs and Pottson.

00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:13.600
 And it is in that that the line "elementary, my dear Pottson"

00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:14.560
 is said.

00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:15.440
 Wow.

00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:19.120
 Then in 1902, there was a piece that was written

00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:20.720
 about Dr. Joseph Bell.

00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:23.440
 Now, Dr. Joseph Bell is someone who it is claimed

00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:25.840
 was the inspiration for Sherlock Holmes.

00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:28.400
 He was a doctor who could walk around and look at you

00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:30.640
 on site and pick out what was wrong with you

00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:32.080
 by just simply staring at you,

00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:35.040
 which is a thing that Sherlock is famous for doing.

00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:37.920
 And in this article, the person writing it says,

00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:39.680
 "As the remarkable man would say,

00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:42.560
 'It is the merest elementary knowledge, my dear Watson.'"

00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:45.360
 So that's the second closest that we get to it.

00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:45.920
 Yeah.

00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:48.560
 But yeah, no one can find it in the actual canon itself

00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:50.240
 of official Sherlock writings.

00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:52.640
 I think if it was there, people would have found it, right?

00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:53.280
 Yeah.

00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:56.320
 Because people do take these books very seriously.

00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:57.440
 You're right.

00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:57.840
 You get people.

00:49:57.840 --> 00:49:58.880
 And they're all digital now.

00:49:58.880 --> 00:49:59.680
 There's a search term.

00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:00.560
 Yeah, it's a search term.

00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:05.520
 I've got just a recommendation of an extraordinary

00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:08.640
 real-life story to do with Sherlock and Conan Doyle.

00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:09.520
 That is worth reading.

00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:13.920
 So it's written by a guy called David Gran.

00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:17.200
 And the story, it was published in The New Yorker

00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:19.280
 and it was called Mysterious Circumstances.

00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:23.200
 So basically, one of the leading Sherlock Holmes experts

00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:24.400
 in the world, living in Britain,

00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:31.760
 was found dead in his room, in his house, with no break-in.

00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:35.040
 No one could work out how anyone got out

00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:37.440
 because there was just one body in there.

00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:41.920
 So this turned in itself into a Sherlock Holmes-style mystery.

00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:44.480
 How did the leading expert of Sherlock Holmes die?

00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:46.400
 It was a guy called Richard Lancelin Green.

00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:48.800
 He was the son of Roger Lancelin Green,

00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:51.280
 who wrote The King Arthur Fables in their modern version,

00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:53.440
 with the most famous version that we would all know.

00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:56.480
 And yeah, so it's extraordinary.

00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:59.360
 He was found death by Garotting, by the way.

00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:01.200
 Oh, hello.

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:01.200
 Hello.

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:02.400
 And what year was this?

00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:03.680
 Did he say the year then?

00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:06.080
 No. Well, he wrote about it in 2004

00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:09.120
 and it wasn't much long before that that this story happened.

00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:12.480
 Did he have one of those guns that shoots people in the crotch?

00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:16.560
 Because then I'm just trying to channel my inner Sherlock Holmes here.

00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:20.720
 Yeah, I mean, I know the answer to the story, but it's not that.

00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:22.960
 Is that Doctor, what was he called?

00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:24.240
 Dr. Bell.

00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:25.360
 Bell.

00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:27.840
 Yeah, he could tell just by looking at you

00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:29.040
 if you'd been shot in the crotch.

00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:35.200
 This man is a Garotter. He's a nasty man.

00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:38.560
 Sorry, Dad, carry on.

00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:41.360
 No, no, I think that's all that I'd like to give in terms of details.

00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:42.880
 It's an extraordinary mystery.

00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:45.200
 Sherlock expert found Garotterd.

00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:48.560
 Yeah, in a locked room mystery, and he's the only person in the room,

00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:50.480
 no one knows who killed him.

00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:53.840
 There was a big paranoia on his part in the lead-up to his death

00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:57.920
 about people wanting to kill him that he told everyone about.

00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:00.000
 It's a big mystery and the story does resolve,

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.120
 so I highly recommend reading it.

00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:03.200
 Oh, you're not going to tell us?

00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:05.520
 No, no, it's honestly, that's what I was saying.

00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:07.200
 This is just a, you need to read it.

00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:10.480
 It would be horrible to ruin the brilliance of this writing.

00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:12.000
 No spoilers.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:15.760
 So have you told people how to get hold of this, how to find it?

00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:18.080
 Yeah, the New Yorker, Mysterious Circumstances,

00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:21.680
 it's called by David Gran, or in the book The Devil vs. Sherlock Holmes.

00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:24.080
 But once we stop recording, you'll just tell us what happened, right?

00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:24.640
 Because...

00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:26.080
 Yes, absolutely.

00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:28.880
 It was a self, he put his cravat on the wrong way around, didn't he?

00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:34.960
 So easy.

00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:38.160
 OK, that's it.

00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:39.280
 That is all of our facts.

00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:40.560

 James, you were on it not too long ago, I believe.

00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:11.280
 Buzz, Anna and I were on it.

00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:13.040
 Yeah, talking about quizzes.

00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:13.440
 Great guess.

00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:14.080
 Yeah, very cool.

00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:14.960
 Great guess.

00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:17.360
 Yeah, I mean, you know, there's two others that would have been really good,

00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:18.400
 but, you know, that's cool.

00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:20.400
