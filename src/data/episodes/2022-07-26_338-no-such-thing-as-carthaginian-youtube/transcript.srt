00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
 Hi everyone, James here. Now, before we start this week's show, just a couple of bits of business,

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:10,640
 first of all, this episode was recorded while Anna was still away and so her place has been taken

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:18,320
 by one of my oldest friends, the absolute genius that is Jenny Ryan. Now, if you're a fan of quiz

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:24,800
 shows, you would know her as the vixen of The Chase. If you're a fan of singing talent shows,

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,680
 you might remember her from Celebrity X Factor last year where she got to the final.

6
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:35,200
 If you're a fan of podcasts, which I know you are, you might know her from Fingers on Buzzers,

7
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,880
 the brilliant quiz-based podcast that Jenny does with comedian Lucy Porter. And actually,

8
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:46,560
 if you go into the back catalogue of Fingers on Buzzers, you might find an old episode with myself

9
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:52,400
 and Anna Tyshinsky on, if you are missing her so much that you really need to hear her dulcet tones.

10
00:00:52,400 --> 00:01:09,120
 Okay, on with the podcast.

11
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:14,640
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

12
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,840
 from four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting here

13
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,280
 with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin and special guest Jenny Ryan. And once again,

14
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,840
 we have gathered round our microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

15
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,560
 And in a particular order, here we go. Starting with you, Jenny.

16
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,960
 Here we go. Trigger warning for grossness. One theory of the origin of the nursery rhyme

17
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:47,680
 Pussycat Pussycat is that it's a reference to Queen Anne's poor personal hygiene and an accumulation

18
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,160
 of grime that once fell out of a skirt during a service at St Paul's Cathedral.

19
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:59,520
 Wow. Wow. Okay. Where to start with that one? Okay, well, let's start with the with the actual

20
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,400
 nursery rhyme because not everyone might know it, right? So how's it go? Andy, why don't you regale

21
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,040
 us with that? Oh, it's Pussycat Pussycat. Where have you been? I've been up to London to look at

22
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:16,240
 the Queen followed by loads more lines. There is more. Pussycat Pussycat. What did you there?

23
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,080
 I've chased a little mouse under her chair or I've frightened a little mouse under her chair.

24
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,760
 That's actually the important bit now, I think. That is the important bit. Yeah, yeah.

25
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:33,040
 So it's thought that little mouse is a mouse shaped deposit of all sorts of things that

26
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:41,520
 might accumulate in a time when nobody really had a bath or washed their nethers. So supposedly,

27
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:50,240
 this particular lump was known as a suttikin, although that may be a more modern name for them

28
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:57,600
 because they resembled little mice and people would have to go and sweep them up off the streets.

29
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,800
 Wait, hang on. Are you saying that the TV series Suttie and Sweep has anything to do with this?

30
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,160
 No.

31
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:09,760
 Thank goodness. Okay, great. Well, my childhood is intact. I will. I'll link them up somehow,

32
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:17,920
 right? So the word suttikins does exist. It comes from the Dutch. It was kind of a joke

33
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:25,120
 about Dutch women. Supposedly, they would put heaters up their dresses to keep warm. And some

34
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,240
 people thought that by doing so, they were breeding a small animal up there and that the animal would

35
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:37,760
 kind of drop out and they would find this thing. And the word came from the word sutt. It's similar

36
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,600
 to the word sutt, as in the stuff you get in of chimney. And of course, Suttie and Sweep is a pun

37
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,400
 on the fact that chimney sweeps would also find sutt. So they are linked in a way, Andy, if that's

38
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,080
 what you think. Oh, great. Okay. No, my childhood is ruined. Thank you very much. Yeah, brilliant.

39
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:58,080
 What kind of person was running so low on inspiration for nursery rhymes that when they saw

40
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,400
 a mess-shaped mouse fall out of the Queens, that they thought this is perfect for kids?

41
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:11,360
 Well, I think what we should say is the most explanations for nursery rhymes are speculative

42
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:17,680
 at best. And there was a couple called Iona and Peter Opie who wrote the Oxford Dictionary of

43
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,880
 Nursery Rhymes. And they basically came to the conclusion that all of these things that people

44
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:30,400
 think probably not true and also that they might just be kind of nice words that kind of sound

45
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,280
 like a good poem and there might not be any reasoning behind them all. So whether that's

46
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,440
 true or whether it's not, I don't know. But the other thing is that Queen Anne had quite a lot

47
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:46,000
 of enemies, right? So it's possible that if this is true, this origin, that it was people trying to

48
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,840
 say bad things about her and you know that. Oh yeah, it was basically gossip, wasn't it? The nursery

49
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,320
 rhymes you've had a way of spreading anything is to make it into a little folk song and get it

50
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,440
 spreading around the streets of London. Weirdly, this is not the only nursery rhyme that Queen Anne

51
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,600
 is supposedly involved with. Really? Yeah, there's another one. Okay, so do you remember the Warming

52
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:15,040
 Pan, baby? Nope. So Anne, when she wasn't Queen yet, she was in line to the throne and so was her

53
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:25,040
 older sister, Mary. And their dad was James II, who was King. And in 1688, James II had a son,

54
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:30,240
 a baby boy, with his new wife, which displaced Mary and Anne from the line of succession. So

55
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,600
 they were kind of lowered down the rung now. And Anne was furious about this. She refused to attend

56
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:43,680
 the birth. And there was a rumour spread that the baby had not been born alive, a miscarriage,

57
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,880
 and actually a live baby had been smuggled into the bedroom in a warming pan, which were these

58
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:54,480
 big brass pans that you would put hot coals into warm up the bed. Right, that's the story.

59
00:05:54,480 --> 00:06:04,400
 Okay. Is that also untrue? But we might get the nursery rhyme, rocker by baby, from that child.

60
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,360
 Really? Yeah. And what's the explanation behind it? It's incredibly furious. Okay.

61
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:17,520
 That thing about how you thought that someone might swap the baby, isn't that why, and I'm going

62
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,320
 to get this wrong, but isn't the home secretary supposed to be at every birth? Is it the home

63
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:29,200
 secretary? Every royal birth, not every birth. It might not be the home secretary. No, it is,

64
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:35,280
 it is. It is the home secretary, yeah. Who's the current home secretary? Pretty Patel. Oh, man.

65
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,160
 Imagine if she had to go around to every single birth in the country. But she would be saying,

66
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,080
 "Get back in there. Get back in there. Don't want you. Don't want you. Go on. Back up, you go."

67
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,720
 I love that idea that you would sort of shame people in history via children telling rhymes.

68
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,320
 We don't do that so much these days. That would be an incredible satirical kids program where it's

69
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:02,480
 just us shaming politicians and so on with new songs that we put out. There was a nursery rhyme

70
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:09,120
 when I was a kid, which was called Maggie Thatcher sticker in the bin. So in a way, it still does

71
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,280
 continue that there will be, they'll probably sing Boris Johnson's sticker in the bin now.

72
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:20,560
 It'll be any Prime Minister. Maggie Thatcher sticker in the bin, put the lid on, sell the

73
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,240
 tape her in. And I remember when she actually resigned as Prime Minister, they came in and

74
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,920
 told us in the classroom, and we all sang it. Really? Wow. We think we're about eight.

75
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:38,000
 We had also Maggie Thatcher, Milk Snatcher kind of a little rhyme about that, didn't we?

76
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,480
 Yeah. Hey, just very quickly for international listeners, and I included myself slightly in

77
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:48,160
 this because I'm not O.F.A. with the British monarchy's history, but Queen Anne was a queen

78
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:54,960
 from her birthday, it was 1665 to 1714. And there's not really been much about her. She's not

79
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,000
 one of the more popular people for pop culture, except for the fact that she had the movie The

80
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,880
 Favourite, which was a fairly recent one, which Olivia Coleman won the Oscar for the portrayal

81
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:09,760
 of her. But outside of that, she kind of slips through the cracks a bit in terms of people's

82
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:15,840
 knowledge about her. And the only stuff that really comes through is all this quite shaming

83
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:21,760
 sort of information about her, people attacking her for her looks and her hygiene and all the

84
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:29,760
 accounts of her body size and so on. It was claimed that when she passed away, 14 men had to carry her

85
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,840
 for her burial. And I don't know if this stuff is true. I don't know if this is part of the

86
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:38,800
 shaming of her, but that's kind of what we know about her. It's 100% true that she did have health

87
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:45,840
 problems and that she was definitely a large lady. She had a lot of gout. She really struggled with

88
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:53,280
 that. But there was definitely also a lot of... She had a lot of enemies. For instance, this thing

89
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:59,040
 at St. Paul's Cathedral, it was a Thanksgiving ceremony after the war. They just finished a war

90
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,240
 with either France or Spain. Spanish succession, wasn't it? Spanish succession. Yeah, I trust you

91
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,840
 to know that, Jen. I'll probably just throw out some half-remembered facts and then you can just

92
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:16,240
 fill in the gaps today, maybe. But they built stands along the side of the Strand and they had

93
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:22,800
 4,000 children singing patriotic songs while they walked down to St. Paul's Cathedral. But a lot of

94
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,960
 people weren't really happy with it because they thought that Queen Anne was secretly trying to get

95
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:32,880
 the Jacobites back onto the English throne and that she was kind of slightly sympathetic to the

96
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:40,640
 Catholics. It was a real kind of time where the monarchy was losing a lot of its power and Parliament

97
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,960
 was kind of coming in. I think that's why we don't hear much about her. It got called the Age of

98
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:50,800
 Party. Wow, that sounds cool. Well, yeah, it was... Unfortunately, it was the Age of the Wigs and

99
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,080
 the Tories, as opposed to everyone having a good time. I was thinking it was Gatsby style.

100
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,200
 Poor time travellers who read that said, "Let's go over there."

101
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,560
 Everybody stank and there were no parties.

102
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:13,280
 Nursery rhymes. Yeah, let's do it. Okay. There always seems to be,

103
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:20,400
 James has mentioned, there's a lot of debunked stories about the origins of nursery rhymes.

104
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:26,080
 And I'm sure that some of them have been retconned into the nursery rhymes themselves.

105
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:31,760
 The Grand Old Duke of York is clearly about a failed military campaign, but there is about a

106
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:39,680
 dozen different ideas of who it's talking about. Who's the current Duke of York? Oh, I don't remember.

107
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:48,240
 Anyway, Pop Goes the Weasel. I really like that one. I love Pop Goes the Weasel.

108
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,080
 That one actually is about Prince Andrew. Yeah.

109
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:57,040
 No one really knows what it means, what Pop Goes the Weasel is.

110
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,920
 There's a lot of copy rhyming slang in there, though, and references to the city road and

111
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,040
 the eagle on the city road, which is actually still there, the pub.

112
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,240
 It is, and it has like a side on the side of the building, doesn't it, with the nursery rhyme on it.

113
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:16,240
 But yeah, so weasel could be your weasel and stout, your throat. So it's like, "Get it down,

114
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,360
 your weasel, mate, when you give someone a pint of beer. Get it down your weasel."

115
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,880
 Or your weasel could be a coat. So there's an idea that it's about putting your coat into the

116
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:34,240
 pawn shop to pay off all your debts. And any time a new expense comes in, Pop Goes the Weasel,

117
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:40,320
 there goes your coat again. So yeah, it's a really good cockney knees up.

118
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,120
 But what I really like about it is in the 1850s, it was like a dance craze,

119
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,240
 Pop Goes the Weasel. So if you were a time traveller and you wanted to find a real good

120
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,120
 party, then you want to go to 1850s London because you're going to know the dance.

121
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,920
 You're going to absolutely smash it. You can go into your music hall and you just dance around.

122
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,840
 And then at the end of it, everyone shouts out, "Pop Goes the Weasel!"

123
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:08,800
 And that's kind of the big sort of ending of every verse. And it was absolutely massive.

124
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,200
 The baby shark of its day.

125
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,800
 So adults were doing this?

126
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:18,880
 Adults were doing it, yeah. There was an advertisement in the Bath Chronicle in 1853

127
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,920
 that offered instruction to the highly fashionable dance of Pop Goes the Weasel.

128
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,800
 So you could pay people to teach you how to do the Pop Goes the Weasel dance.

129
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,040
 And even then, no one really knew what it meant. It was just like a nonsense phrase, really.

130
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,120
 But yeah, it's just like us loving the Macarena. I don't know what the hell that means,

131
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:43,760
 but it's a dancer. I haven't dedicated myself to understanding the lyrics.

132
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,520
 I think it's about a lady called Macarena.

133
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,440
 It's about a lady whose husband has gone away and she's

134
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,240
 courting all the other local boys because her boyfriend isn't there anymore.

135
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,200
 500 years from now, people will be saying, "Actually, the Macarena is about..."

136
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,400
 Actually, it's about Brexit.

137
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,480
 I love it. Do you guys remember the one that goes, "Do your ears hang low?

138
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,560
 Do they wobble too and throw back kids' song?"

139
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,040
 We said, "Can you tie them in a bow?" I think.

140
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,160
 Yeah, "Can you tie them in a..."

141
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,040
 And actually, I think it was, "Do your boobs hang low? Do your ears hang low?"

142
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,200
 Well, I think it's, "Do your balls hang low?"

143
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,280
 "Do your balls and do your boobs are the sort of the rude versions of it."

144
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:27,520
 But the assumption is that it was the kids' song, "Do your ears hang low?"

145
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,160
 And then when you got sort of rude kids at school going,

146
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,760
 "Have you heard this version?" You would sing it.

147
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,400
 Anyway, it turns out that the original versions were,

148
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,640
 "Do your balls hang low and do your boobs hang low?"

149
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,080
 And then it got sort of turned into a more presentable for kids,

150
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,200
 "Do your ears hang low?"

151
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,720
 So it was sung in wartime during World War I on the Western Front.

152
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,640
 They would be singing it in the trenches, "Do your balls hang low?"

153
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,040
 And then, "Do the sailor's hornpipe." Yeah.

154
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,600
 Right. "Do your balls hang low? Can you swing them through?

155
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,840
 Can you tie them in a knot? Can you tie them in a bow?

156
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,640
 Can you tuck them to the ceiling with that free and easy feeling?"

157
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:03,280
 Anyway, it goes, "That's amazing."

158
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,800
 It's true. I've never heard that version. I don't think so.

159
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,760
 That's the only one. I like that one as a child. Yeah?

160
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,760
 These things just stay with you, don't they?

161
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,240
 Along with, you know, Margaret Thatcher, "She's our hero."

162
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:20,160
 Okay. We went to very different schools.

163
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,200
 Gave everyone in the classroom a black armband when she resigned.

164
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,520
 Have you heard of telltale tit? This is a really short one.

165
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,840
 Telltale tit, "Your tongue shall be slit,

166
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,240
 and all the dogs in the town shall have a little bit."

167
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,280
 So I'd never heard that before, but it's very common in Bolton, I can say.

168
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,400
 Yeah. All the dogs in Bolton will have a little bit.

169
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,080
 But I just think that's amazing.

170
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,160
 It's because it's basically a children's equivalent

171
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,320
 of saying snitches get stitches. Yeah.

172
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,200
 Yeah? Telltale tit, "Your tongue will split,

173
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,120
 and all the little doggies will have a little bit."

174
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,120
 That's what it used to say. It's terrifying.

175
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,840
 Do you guys know Pissabed? No.

176
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:01,680
 It goes, "Pissabed, Pissabed, Barley, but your bum is so heavy, you can't get up."

177
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:09,600
 And this was published in the very first nursery rhyme songbook

178
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,000
 that was printed in Britain in 1744.

179
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,560
 It's the first time that Ba Ba Blacksheep was ever printed in a nursery rhyme book.

180
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,800
 So it was called Tommy Thumb's Pretty Songbook.

181
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,080
 And we thought there was only one copy that was left,

182
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,200
 which was held, I think, in the British Library.

183
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,120
 But one went up for auction a few years ago.

184
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,000
 So there might be a couple more out there.

185
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 But it had 40 nursery rhymes in it.

186
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,360
 And all the classics, Ba Ba Blacksheep, Hickory Dickory Dock,

187
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,640
 London Bridge is Falling Down, Mary Mary's Quite Contrary.

188
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,840
 This thing, a song with six pence.

189
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,280
 And then Pissabed.

190
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,800
 Tommy Thumb's Pretty Songbook.

191
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,880
 They were actually all about Pretty Patel, weren't they?

192
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:53,760
 That's where that name came from.

193
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,080
 OK, it is time for fact number two.

194
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,920
 And that is Andy.

195
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,400
 My fact is that in 1862, there was a special cravat invented

196
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,800
 to stop people strangling you in the street.

197
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:12,640
 So if I went to strangle you, Andy, with this, my hands go for your neck.

198
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,560
 Is it that the cravat is so full of folds and so on,

199
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,320
 I can never actually find your neck?

200
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,360
 How does it work?

201
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,120
 It's a real pencil neck, yeah.

202
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,920
 No, it's got spikes on the inside.

203
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,960
 So you could go for the neck.

204
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:24,960
 On the inside?

205
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,320
 But you get a pretty nasty--

206
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:26,800
 Oh, sorry.

207
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,280
 The spikes are on the outside.

208
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,240
 Oh, right, OK.

209
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,760
 Concealed by a layer of cloth.

210
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,920
 Don't put that on the wrong way round.

211
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,160
 No, you're right.

212
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:40,800
 You're right, you're right.

213
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,760
 Sorry, they're on the outside.

214
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,880
 But they're cleverly concealed by the ruffles at the front of the cravat.

215
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,520
 And so Dan, as soon as you probably try and put your thumbs around my windpipe,

216
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,840
 nice try mate, you're going to get a spiky thumb.

217
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:57,120
 I also read that some of them had razor blades sewn into the folds as well.

218
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,360
 Yeah, pretty intense items of clothing.

219
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,320
 And these were designed to fight the menace of garrottings,

220
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,760
 because there was a panic.

221
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,320
 In fact, there were two panics in the mid-19th century about garrottings.

222
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:17,200
 One in 1856, and then it sort of flared up again in 1862.

223
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:22,160
 And there was this massive panic about actually a relatively small crime wave

224
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,200
 of people being mugged.

225
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:28,320
 And the method of mugging was someone would grab someone around the throat,

226
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,000
 and then their accomplice would rob them.

227
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,280
 And--

228
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:36,080
 Yeah, I should just say, like a garrotting to me is like you get some cheese wire or something,

229
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,240
 like in a movie, they would get some wire and they would put it around your throat.

230
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,880
 But this was actually more like putting someone in a sleeper hold

231
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,960
 in like a wrestling move, wasn't it, than--

232
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,400
 Yeah, yeah.

233
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,400
 I mean, it could definitely, it could hurt you very badly.

234
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,880
 I mean, it could absolutely, it could kill you as well.

235
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,440
 I don't think very many people at all were actually killed by this.

236
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,560
 But it led to a change in the law.

237
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,520
 The parliament passed the 1863 Garottas Act.

238
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,640
 And yeah, this was a big panic.

239
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,880
 There is an argument that not only did not many people die of this,

240
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,920
 no people died of it.

241
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,280
 And it was completely made up.

242
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,160
 Yeah, absolutely.

243
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,480
 So there's an argument that it was completely made up by newspapers.

244
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,800
 So there was an MP who got mugged.

245
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,600
 He was called Hugh Pilkington, and he had his pocket watch stolen.

246
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,480
 And they said that he was garrotted when they stole his watch.

247
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,760
 But actually, it seems like he wasn't really.

248
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,360
 And then basically, newspapers started calling any minor instant.

249
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,800
 They said, oh, this was a garrotting.

250
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,520
 And then some of the magistrates would say that it was a garrotting,

251
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,640
 even though it wasn't, because they knew that the person would get more time

252
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,560
 or a stronger punishment for it.

253
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:48,640
 And then after the 1863 Act, there was no more garrottings.

254
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,960
 But the argument among historians, a lot of them,

255
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,640
 is that there were never any in the first place.

256
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,240
 It's very much what's it in the Simpsons,

257
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,160
 where it's like this rock scares away tigers or whatever it is.

258
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,600
 Yeah, right.

259
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,560
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

260
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,800
 But there were descriptions of how it worked.

261
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,880
 So it would be a three-person gang,

262
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,520
 which consisted of a front stall, a back stall, and the nasty man.

263
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,320
 OK, so.

264
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,120
 Tag yourself.

265
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:21,600
 I think the front stall distracts you.

266
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,680
 He stops you and says, oh, excuse me, do you have the time.

267
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,200
 And then the back stall is the lookout,

268
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,440
 who's making sure there are no police coming along.

269
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,800
 And the nasty man is the one who actually does the garrotting.

270
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,640
 I could have worked that out.

271
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,120
 Oh, OK.

272
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:39,120
 There was another thing you could buy in 1858,

273
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,280
 a guy called Henry Boll invented a pistol one on your back,

274
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,680
 which would discharge into a criminal's crotch.

275
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,440
 I love this.

276
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,560
 That would go, I suppose that would go for the back man, would it?

277
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,760
 Oh, yeah, that would be to take the back stall.

278
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,160
 Yeah.

279
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:54,400
 Yeah.

280
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,160
 Well, no, the grotter is going around you with the sleepball, right?

281
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:58,880
 Oh, good point.

282
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,480
 So that's for the nasty man here.

283
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,360
 Yeah, that's nasty man.

284
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:02,720
 Wow.

285
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,800
 I think I can't believe this was a real thing.

286
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,520
 Did that work?

287
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,960
 Did anyone?

288
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,480
 I'm not sure any of this stuff was.

289
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,320
 No, this is a real thing.

290
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,520
 It was real, sorry.

291
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,320
 It was real, but I don't think everyone was wearing them.

292
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,200
 You know, it was kind of.

293
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:15,200
 Right.

294
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,840
 Wow.

295
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,080
 Imagine that you're going out just to the local pub,

296
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,840
 you're wearing spikes around your neck,

297
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,680
 you've got a pistol facing backwards.

298
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,320
 I mean, Jesus, what a look.

299
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,520
 This gun sounds amazing,

300
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,920
 because it looks just like a little belt pack, doesn't it?

301
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,760
 And you, but the thing is, obviously,

302
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,760
 you had guns weren't that advanced yet.

303
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,680
 So apparently you had to reach back to cock the hammer of the gun.

304
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:41,520
 And then you had to kind of pull a ripcord at your waistline,

305
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,880
 which would actually fire the gun and fire a lead ball into your attackers.

306
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,240
 It would be recoil.

307
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,160
 Like normally recoil goes in one direction,

308
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,360
 but if it's firing there,

309
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,760
 you would just be kind of thrusting your crotch forward,

310
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,400
 wouldn't you?

311
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,560
 Like whenever you fired this gun.

312
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,640
 Yeah, you would get blasted into the front stall.

313
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,880
 So you're a kind of human cannonball.

314
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,320
 The nasty man's nowhere to be seen.

315
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,720
 It's so amazing.

316
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,640
 The Henry Ball Belt Pistol, I love it.

317
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,960
 Oh, you could just hire some bodyguards

318
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,760
 to walk you to and from the pub,

319
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,800
 like the Bayswater Brothers who advertised.

320
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,320
 The Bayswater Brothers whose height is respected

321
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,880
 with six feet four inches and six feet 11,

322
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,400
 and the United Breadth of whose shoulders

323
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,360
 extends to as much as three yards, one foot five inches.

324
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,440
 Give respectfully notice to the gentry and public

325
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,440
 of Paddington, Kensington, Stoke, Newington,

326
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,280
 Chelsea, Eaton Square, and Sheppard's Bush

327
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,560
 that they will be most happy

328
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,280
 upon all social and jovial expeditions

329
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,680
 to escort elderly or nervous persons

330
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,960
 in the streets after dark.

331
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,680
 Wow, they sound great.

332
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,040
 So they'd served several months in the police force

333
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,000
 and they would go through any neighborhood,

334
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,040
 even the worst grotting district well known.

335
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,200
 Yeah, but they don't go south of the river, do they?

336
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,080
 Typical.

337
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,680
 It's just like cabbies all over again.

338
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,240
 No, grotting south of the river.

339
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,360
 Wow.

340
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,880
 Some more kind of panics.

341
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,080
 Oh, yeah.

342
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,640
 Because I'm saying that this grotting wasn't really a thing.

343
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,040
 It might have been a thing, but that's the kind of angle I'm taking.

344
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,040
 It's definitely a way smaller thing than

345
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,400
 the 1863 Garottas Act would suggest.

346
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:22,560
 In 1954, a load of people in Seattle were really worried

347
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,560
 because there were loads of holes in their windscreens.

348
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,040
 And everyone was going out looking at their car

349
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,080
 and they find little holes and they didn't know what had happened.

350
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,840
 They thought it was vandals.

351
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,400
 They thought it might have been fallout from nuclear tests

352
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,760
 that were happening, to be honest, not that close to Seattle,

353
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,360
 but they thought maybe it was that.

354
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,480
 And then a load of scientists were brought in

355
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,080
 and they looked at what had happened.

356
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,160
 And it turned out that these pits were there all along,

357
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,680
 but it was just happened that in that year, 1954,

358
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,000
 someone noticed it and then everyone else went,

359
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,360
 "Oh my God, I've got that as well."

360
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,040
 "Oh my God, I've got that as well."

361
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,480
 That's very funny, that's so weird.

362
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,320
 Yeah, in 1788, you have the London Monster.

363
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,280
 Oh, yeah.

364
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:03,920
 Oh, yes.

365
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,640
 Who was a guy who went around basically

366
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,320
 stabbing ladies in the skirt area,

367
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,040
 ripping their clothes.

368
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:16,240
 Sometimes he'd be presenting them with flowers

369
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,360
 and there'd be something sharp concealed within them.

370
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:19,840
 Oh, no.

371
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,880
 Yeah, it was a disgrace.

372
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,280
 But it probably didn't happen.

373
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,520
 Oh, okay, roll a question.

374
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,080
 There were up to 50 women reported to the police

375
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:30,960
 that they'd been attacked.

376
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,320
 And it was like approving that some of these women

377
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,000
 had inflicted wounds themselves.

378
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,880
 They were just scratched or they just ripped the dress.

379
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,200
 But somebody did get convicted.

380
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,200
 A woman was attacked in the January, I think, of 1790.

381
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:51,600
 And she saw a guy in the park six months later,

382
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,120
 got a boyfriend to follow him home.

383
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:58,400
 It was this ex-Ballet dancer who now made artificial flowers,

384
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,800
 this Welsh guy, who got up before the beak

385
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,560
 and they found out that the worst offence they could charge him with

386
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,560
 was actually damaging clothes.

387
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:08,880
 Oh, right.

388
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:14,960
 Apparently they're damaging clothes under the law at the time

389
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,200
 because their expensive foreign clothes came with a harsher penalty

390
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,960
 than actually injuring these women attempting murder and stabbing.

391
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,240
 So eventually this guy got six years,

392
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,120
 but mysteriously there were no attacks after that,

393
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,680
 even though he probably wasn't the attacker.

394
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,600
 But during a two-year period,

395
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,960
 women started wearing copper pans under their petticoats

396
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,040
 as a form of self-defense against the London monster.

397
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:46,080
 So there's a James Gilray engraving of the monster

398
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,000
 attacking a woman in a pulsa pescat

399
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,120
 and there's just a pan there, so he's disappointed.

400
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,000
 Yeah, well, you would be.

401
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,360
 Thank you.

402
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:58,720
 Did you say this was 1788 that this was happening?

403
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,760
 1788 it started, yeah, to 1790.

404
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,000
 I didn't think there were people making artificial flowers in the 1780s.

405
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 Yeah, they'd be made of silk, I would guess, rather than...

406
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,240
 Yeah, I just sort of assumed that they were a thing from the '70s onwards,

407
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,280
 like kind of like plastic or...

408
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,240
 I can't believe that.

409
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,320
 Is that what you got out of that story, Andy?

410
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,760
 Apparently, apparently, yes.

411
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,200
 In the earliest, earliest days of this podcast,

412
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,560
 I mentioned a fact about the precursor to the London monster,

413
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,640
 which was a man who used to go around London

414
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,520
 and he would slap women on the bum and then he would run off

415
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,600
 and as he ran off, he would yell, "Spanko!"

416
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,640
 I think he was called whipping Tom or something like that.

417
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,440
 Can I just say with that, I think in that case,

418
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,880
 if you had a copper pan in your petticoats,

419
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,560
 then it would have the opposite effect,

420
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,880
 because it would make a really nice resonant sound

421
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,080
 if you spanked someone and they were like...

422
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,280
 Yeah, absolutely.

423
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,120
 ...a copper pot there, wouldn't it?

424
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:53,680
 That's true.

425
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,960
 Like playing the timpani.

426
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,880
 That would be like the J. Arthur rank symbol

427
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,400
 at the beginning of films, wouldn't it?

428
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,120
 It's a spanko running on,

429
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,520
 hitting a petticoat and running off.

430
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,400
 So was he caught?

431
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,280
 Dan, was he caught?

432
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,600
 Do we know who the real Spanko was?

433
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,360
 Oh, Spanko? No, I don't know any...

434
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,960
 I just... That's an old memory,

435
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,720
 as Jenny was talking about the London monster.

436
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,000
 He was a precursor.

437
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,800
 But yeah, amazing character, the London monster.

438
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,680
 And huge panic off the back of that.

439
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,360
 Oh yeah, if James Gilray is doing engravings of you,

440
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,640
 then you know you've made it.

441
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,040
 Yeah.

442
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,800
 I don't know James Gilray.

443
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,800
 Was he Mr. Engraver back then?

444
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,680
 Oh, he was Mr...

445
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,120
 You know, your political cartoons, those are all him.

446
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,000
 You know, he's the Steve Bell of his day.

447
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,200
 I didn't know who it was either,

448
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,560
 but I thought by keeping quiet,

449
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,760
 people would assume that I did.

450
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,480
 You've definitely, definitely 100% seen his work.

451
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:46,800
 Okay.

452
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,080
 Yeah, there are all the really big complicated drawings

453
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,480
 where people have to be labelled quite precisely.

454
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,640
 So, you know, there's a brilliant engraving.

455
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,680
 I'm just making this up now,

456
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,000
 but you know, there'll be a monkey and a hot-air balloon,

457
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,840
 but the monkey has to be labelled

458
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,520
 Britain's response to the Eritrean.

459
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,760
 And the balloon is labelled European integration

460
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,280
 after the 1763 act of...

461
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,640
 Oh, I don't get this at all.

462
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:16,160
 But back in the day, people have one glanced at it like,

463
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,680
 "Yeah, I've got it like, like... "Brilliant art.

464
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,840
 "Marius, the Montaginius."

465
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:27,840
 Okay, it's time for fact number three,

466
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,840
 and that is James.

467
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,280
 Okay, my fact this week is that for 24 years,

468
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:37,440
 any ship travelling between Wellington and Nelson in New Zealand

469
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,320
 would be guided through the most dangerous section

470
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,720
 by a dolphin called "Pelarous Jack".

471
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,600
 I should have done that in a pirate voice,

472
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,560
 shouldn't I?

473
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,560
 Would be guided through the most dangerous section

474
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,280
 by a dolphin called "Pelarous Jack".

475
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,720
 Is that better? No.

476
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,600
 I couldn't tell the difference.

477
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:03,040
 So, James, what north is this?

478
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,480
 This is a fact.

479
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,920
 Okay.

480
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,720
 Perhaps.

481
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,280
 So, at the north end of New Zealand's South Island,

482
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,040
 there's a little stretch of water.

483
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,240
 It's really, really perilous.

484
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,240
 It's called the French Pass,

485
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:21,120
 and there are loads of really bad currents and high waves,

486
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,960
 and it could be really difficult to get through.

487
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,480
 And at the turn of the 20th century,

488
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,560
 any boat that was going through there

489
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,520
 would always have this dolphin alongside it.

490
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,560
 Now, whether the dolphin was deliberately helping

491
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,520
 the humans across,

492
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,160
 or whether it was just being a dolphin

493
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,520
 and kind of swimming in the wake of a boat,

494
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,360
 like dolphins often do, we don't know.

495
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,400
 Well, we do know,

496
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,160
 because it didn't even know it was a dolphin.

497
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,000
 It was just a goat.

498
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,560
 But what is true...

499
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,080
 But it was there. It was there, right?

500
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,920
 It was there, and people believed

501
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,200
 that that's what was happening.

502
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,440
 So, people were writing at the time,

503
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,160
 there's articles from 1905, 1906,

504
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,560
 where people said they were on this boat,

505
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,760
 and the dolphin was acting as a pilot for the ships,

506
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,840
 and that it would take them deliberately

507
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,160
 into the areas where the water was deeper,

508
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,320
 because it knew there would be less chance

509
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,360
 of the boat being smashed on the rocks.

510
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,280
 And then, some people didn't like the dolphin being there,

511
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,880
 and some people shot at it.

512
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,600
 On one particular time, when someone shot this dolphin,

513
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,680
 there was a law that came up that said

514
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,480
 you are specifically not allowed to shoot

515
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,120
 this particular dolphin in New Zealand,

516
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,960
 and it was the first sea creature

517
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,600
 to be protected by law anywhere in the world.

518
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,480
 I mean, between this and the 1863 Garotas Act,

519
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,440
 it does feel like legislators had a lot more time on their hands

520
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,240
 back in the day.

521
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,760
 But so, the story goes that the boat,

522
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:50,080
 the ship that shot at Jack was called the SS Penguin,

523
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,720
 and the story goes that he disappeared,

524
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,520
 and he came back later, but five years later,

525
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,720
 the SS Penguin struck rocks and sank,

526
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,200
 and 75 passengers perished, and as the story goes,

527
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,560
 it's because Jack, when he saw the SS Penguin coming,

528
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,360
 would ignore it.

529
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,440
 He knew that that was the boat that shot him,

530
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,600
 and so, maybe without his help,

531
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,800
 that's what led to it being slammed into the rocks.

532
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,760
 It's a great story. I love it.

533
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,080
 I should leave it.

534
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,040
 "Pellaris" is a really weird name,

535
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,520
 because I thought when you said that the French Pass,

536
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,360
 this strait of water was very perilous,

537
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,960
 I thought, oh, maybe it's a burden of that.

538
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,520
 I don't think it is.

539
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,080
 It's not, no.

540
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,920
 It's a ship's instrument or something?

541
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:31,760
 There was a ship called the HMS Pellaris,

542
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,800
 and there's a Pellaris, sorry,

543
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,200
 and it kind of went around that area of New Zealand

544
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,520
 and Australia, so there's a Pellaris Island as well,

545
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,440
 and a few different things named after Pellaris,

546
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,080
 which was this discovery ship.

547
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,520
 Okay.

548
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,920
 But Pellaris was also the name of Hannibal's pilot,

549
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,920
 so that may be where it comes from.

550
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,560
 Hannibal.

551
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,360
 Hannibal Lecter.

552
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:58,240
 Yeah, Hannibal Lecter needed a pilot to take him around to eat people.

553
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,760
 You've got to have a private pilot.

554
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,120
 You're a busy man.

555
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,280
 These livers aren't going to cook themselves.

556
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,800
 Do you mean Hannibal as in the...?

557
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,720
 Hannibal as in the elephant dude.

558
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,600
 The elephant dude.

559
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,800
 Carthaginian general.

560
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,440
 Elephant dude.

561
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,120
 Now sounds like we're talking about the elephant man,

562
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,720
 who is a different person to Hannibal.

563
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,520
 That elephant dude would definitely be the name

564
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,280
 of Hannibal's YouTube channel, wouldn't it?

565
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:23,120
 We're going to try and take some elephants

566
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,160
 and invade Rome next week.

567
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,600
 It's going to be completely crazy.

568
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,920
 Hit like and subscribe to see if it works.

569
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:32,480
 But yeah, there was, when I sent this fact round,

570
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,280
 Andy, you found an article that said that perhaps it wasn't real,

571
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:41,920
 and that the fact that the people thought that Dolphin was guiding

572
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,480
 people was invented quite a few years later.

573
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:49,840
 But I found an article from April 1905,

574
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,640
 where there was a guy called Mr. Generous Hayes,

575
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,560
 who said that...

576
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,560
 No, not...

577
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,120
 Definitely not made up.

578
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:03,120
 What date in April, James?

579
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,600
 It was the 29th of April,

580
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,920
 but this story had come all the way from Australia,

581
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,920
 so it could definitely take 28 days

582
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,720
 to get to the central Somerset Gazette,

583
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,840
 which is where I read it.

584
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:21,200
 But he said that Jack acts as a most effective pilot,

585
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,480
 escorting all kinds of vessels in and out of the French Pass.

586
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,480
 Yeah, and he was sort of globally famous.

587
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,600
 There's stories of Mark Twain specifically going on that route

588
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,240
 to see him.

589
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,040
 Wow.

590
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,120
 Yeah, and another, an English author

591
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,560
 called Frank T. Bullen as well.

592
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,560
 Both had written about it.

593
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,680
 So, yeah, I think the contentious thing is,

594
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,920
 was he piloting them or was he just having fun?

595
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,880
 In real.

596
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,400
 But there's photos and so on.

597
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,920
 I must say, every time I read that,

598
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,960
 I read that in a few places,

599
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,400
 and it always said well-known figures such as Mark Twain

600
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,400
 and English author Frank T. Bullen.

601
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,760
 And I always thought, one of those I have heard of, for sure.

602
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,200
 I saw, when I saw New Zealand,

603
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,120
 I obviously got in touch with my friend,

604
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:06,560
 who's an ex-pat Kiwi, Amy, and I messaged her and I said,

605
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,760
 "Have you heard of Pellaris Jack?"

606
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,680
 And she went, "Oh my God, I love him.

607
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,080
 "He's a celebrity dolphin in New Zealand."

608
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,240
 And I was like, "A celebrity dolphin."

609
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,360
 And there's more than one celebrity dolphin in New Zealand.

610
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,680
 It's a thing, and they all have statues.

611
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:25,120
 So, there's Oppo, who was famous in New Zealand

612
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,000
 during the summer of 1955 to '56,

613
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,240
 because he played with children,

614
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:35,360
 and very soon after, he'd become stranded and died.

615
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,120
 So, that's a cheery story.

616
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,520
 Well, his full name was Oppo-Ni-Jack, wasn't it?

617
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,480
 Yeah, Oppo-Ni-Jack.

618
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,520
 Oh, wow. Sorry.

619
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,880
 Pellaris Jack himself, because he's the archetype

620
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,120
 of celebrity dolphins in New Zealand, obviously.

621
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:56,240
 And then Mokko came around in 2006 to do a similar kind of thing.

622
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,320
 But, you know, neither of them was that useful.

623
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,120
 They weren't guiding.

624
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,320
 They were just kind of interhumans, so became quite famous.

625
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,840
 Mokko was a guide on one famous occasion,

626
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,200
 because, again, another Kiwi dolphin.

627
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,480
 In 2008, there were two pygmy sperm whales who were trapped.

628
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,800
 I think they were trapped between the beach

629
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,720
 and a sand bank that was built up.

630
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,080
 But they didn't know what to do,

631
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,400
 and the authorities were saying,

632
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,640
 "Oh, well, should we kill them?

633
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,240
 "Because otherwise, they're going to really suffer,

634
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,120
 "and they might die."

635
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:29,600
 And Mokko the dolphin led them out through a narrow channel

636
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,920
 at the end of the sand bank that they were in,

637
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,800
 so there was a bit of water

638
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,720
 that was just deep enough to get these whales through.

639
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:37,200
 So, obviously, it became a huge celebrity,

640
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,400
 and then it all went to his head, and he started sexually...

641
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,760
 Doing a lot of cocaine.

642
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,000
 Well, he started sexually assaulting swimmers,

643
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,800
 and I know it is, you know, celebrity excess.

644
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,680
 He started making what was called amorous advances

645
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:54,240
 to women in the water, and also just being a bit of a thug.

646
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,080
 He started tipping over water skiers,

647
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,120
 and I can't believe this,

648
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,440
 but apparently stealing surfers' surfboards?

649
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,280
 Now, I don't know...

650
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,360
 I can't envisage how a dolphin does that.

651
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,360
 Why do you need to?

652
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,760
 You're already quite efficient in the water.

653
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,600
 I mean...

654
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:13,360
 For a dolphin, a surfboard might be like a hoverboard for a human.

655
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,880
 Like, he might...

656
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,520
 Oh, yeah.

657
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,120
 Can you imagine if you're a dolphin

658
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,560
 and one of your mates comes along

659
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,040
 and he's just kind of lying on a surfboard?

660
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,400
 That guy is cool.

661
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,280
 He's chilling.

662
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,600
 OK, so James is trying to justify Mokko's crime wave.

663
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,960
 You Mokko apologist.

664
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,720
 But he still has a statue, though.

665
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,320
 They are all blooming statues, yeah.

666
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:34,880
 Wow.

667
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,440
 Going to commemorate your local celebrity dolphin.

668
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,760
 That didn't get pulled down in the whole recent...

669
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,000
 It might be re-evaluated.

670
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,880
 You know who also seems to be into New Zealand dolphins?

671
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,400
 Is the Scottish.

672
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,160
 So, it's just a very curious thing,

673
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:57,920
 but Perilous Jack was turned into a song and a dance in Scotland.

674
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,000
 And so there's a song that goes...

675
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,600
 And I don't know the music to it,

676
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,720
 but a famous fish there used to be called Pelerous Jack.

677
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,280
 He'd always swim far out to sea when a ship came back.

678
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:14,080
 And this got turned into a dance which you could do.

679
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,560
 And there's a move called the dolphin hay,

680
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,640
 which I guess is a bit like the pop goes the weasel.

681
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,200
 It's sort of like a dolphin move.

682
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,280
 So that was turned into a dance,

683
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,080
 and there's a full dance routine about Pelerous Jack,

684
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,160
 but also Oppo, who we were talking about,

685
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:32,000
 in 1994 was also turned into a Scottish dance as well.

686
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,680
 Yeah.

687
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,080
 So, if you go to Scotland,

688
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:39,360
 likely there are people who know two New Zealand dolphin dances.

689
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,440
 Well, Dan, I've got some ends

690
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,000
 with the Scottish country dancing community,

691
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,080
 and I can confirm there's no shortage of things

692
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,120
 they've named dances after.

693
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:51,440
 There are so many hundreds of dances that I'm kind of...

694
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,040
 And they're just going through Wikipedia on random pages

695
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,040
 and going, "Okay, well, I'm going to do this

696
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,000
 after George Washington High School in Milwaukee."

697
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,520
 It is amazing the number of things they have done so now after.

698
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,480
 Yeah, very cool.

699
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,120
 I think it must be an extension of the nursery rhyme thing.

700
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,560
 So Scottish country dancing has taken up the mantle.

701
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,360
 Have you ever done any Scottish country dancing?

702
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:15,840
 What, me?

703
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,400
 Yeah.

704
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,520
 Yeah, yeah, I've done a bit.

705
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,800
 Yeah, it's great.

706
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,160
 It's really, really fun.

707
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,600
 Do you know the dolphin hay?

708
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,680
 I don't know the dolphin hay, no.

709
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,240
 I'm not off the top of your head, but...

710
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,760
 Thousands of dances, Dan.

711
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,040
 It's not entry level, anyway.

712
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,080
 No, absolutely not.

713
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,640
 That's a dashing white sergeant is the first thing you learn.

714
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,000
 I think you have to be pretty...

715
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,120
 You have to be balls deep

716
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,280
 before you learn the dolphin hay off by heart.

717
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,120
 Did you do country dancing at school?

718
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,000
 No, I didn't.

719
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,120
 Jenny, did you?

720
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:48,080
 I remember a couple of sessions of it

721
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,960
 when they didn't have a PE teacher.

722
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,840
 Emergency country dance.

723
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,080
 It was raining, and so a teacher,

724
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,160
 he happened to know some country dancing.

725
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,400
 Oh, OK, so you didn't have a dance instructor

726
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,400
 who'd been kept in a cupboard for years until the PE teacher fell ill.

727
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,400
 Because when I was at primary school,

728
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,320
 so Jenny and I went to the same secondary school,

729
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,760
 but when I was at primary school,

730
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,320
 we did country dancing every week.

731
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:14,720
 Wow.

732
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,800
 Was it English country dancing you were doing?

733
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,880
 It's like Morris dancing, I guess.

734
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,640
 It's like, all I remember is that you had to dozee-doh your partner.

735
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,320
 Yeah, that's all I remember.

736
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,680
 All I remember is dozee-doh.

737
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,640
 There is one dance that's an English country dance,

738
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,680
 and English country dancing's a bit rarer for whatever reason.

739
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,800
 There are still loads of dances,

740
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,000
 but they just don't get danced as much,

741
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,840
 because they're all from Jane Austen's time.

742
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,560
 But there's one which is called Mr. Beveridge's Maggot.

743
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,280
 It's my favourite name of a dance.

744
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,680
 That's wonderful.

745
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,640
 That's absolutely wonderful.

746
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,080
 And what happens at the end of that?

747
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,160
 Um, I don't know.

748
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,480
 I don't know if this was named after an actual maggot

749
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,480
 that was like a celebrity maggot,

750
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,560
 which saved a carriage from crashing or whatever.

751
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:01,040
 I don't know what to go from there.

752
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,560
 Dolphins?

753
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,000
 Let's talk about dolphins.

754
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,720
 Yeah, yes.

755
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:09,200
 One thing that dolphins do, which I didn't know,

756
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,560
 is that they can wear gloves over their noses.

757
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,160
 Okay, well, this is amazing.

758
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:20,400
 Andy, is this a real glove over a nose,

759
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,960
 or is this an analogy for a glove over a nose?

760
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,600
 Because Sarah Pascoe called us out last week,

761
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:29,680
 if you remember, about this ladybird bought a hat.

762
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,560
 And then it's never an actual hat.

763
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,680
 Oh my god, I've fallen right into the Pascoe ladybird hat trap,

764
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,120
 because no, it's not a glove.

765
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,480
 It's not a glove. Obviously, it's not a glove.

766
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,120
 What is it?

767
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,360
 They, so, you know, marine sponges.

768
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,360
 They're animals, technically, aren't they?

769
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,040
 The sponges are very simple animals.

770
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,640
 They kind of pick up these sponges,

771
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,280
 and they press them onto the end of their snouts.

772
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,000
 And then when they're foraging, they're using their snout,

773
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,160
 and they are probing for prey sometimes

774
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,760
 under the surface of the sea.

775
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,840
 But there can be sharp things there.

776
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,560
 And so these sponges on their noses

777
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:08,480
 act as a kind of bit of protective equipment, if you like,

778
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,960
 to stop them hurting themselves when they're jamming around there.

779
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,440
 And they particularly pick conical sponges,

780
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,560
 because they can jam them more easily onto the end of their noses.

781
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,120
 They're nice.

782
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:19,760
 That's cool.

783
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,320
 Yeah.

784
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,240
 I think glove is acceptable for that,

785
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,160
 because that's basically their hand.

786
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,000
 And they're putting something over the hand

787
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,080
 so they can go rippling about in things.

788
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,640
 So, yeah, I'll accept it.

789
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,160
 I'm not going to Pascoe you on this.

790
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,000
 I don't know.

791
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,240
 If James hadn't called Andy out just then,

792
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,360
 I would be at parties going,

793
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,360
 "You know they wear marigolds on their face?"

794
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,160
 Dolphins can talk to each other on the telephone.

795
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,080
 Jesus Christ.

796
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,400
 OK.

797
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,000
 I think we all want to Pascoe you on this one.

798
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,840
 Well, there was an aquarium in Hawaii

799
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,480
 where they had the mother in a separate tank,

800
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,360
 to a two-year-old calf dolphin.

801
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:04,320
 And they organised an audio link between the two tanks

802
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,560
 and got them chatting to each other.

803
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,800
 And the calls and responses were in line

804
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,280
 with the kind of calls and responses you would hear in the wild,

805
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,480
 even though they couldn't see each other.

806
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,920
 And they don't know what they said.

807
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,960
 We've spoken about the dolphin dictionary

808
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,800
 that they're working on at the moment, scientists.

809
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,680
 But we do know that they were calling responses

810
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,400
 that were happening.

811
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,280
 And it's sort of, they think the conversation was like,

812
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,760
 "Hey, what's your name? Oh, my name's this. Oh, great.

813
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,600
 There's lots of fish here. Oh, that's good to know."

814
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:33,600
 Yeah, so they can chat over the phone.

815
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,240
 OK, actually, again, sounded unreasonable,

816
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,840
 but I think that's completely legit.

817
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,120
 They can chat over the phone.

818
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,360
 They can't dial, and they can't, you know...

819
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,800
 No.

820
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,120
 They'd have to take the glove off to dial, obviously.

821
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:51,040
 So, also, dolphins can attack enemies of the Soviet Union.

822
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:56,080
 Because that's the thing, isn't it?

823
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:00,160
 Dolphins, they are trained in various armies.

824
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,800
 The Americans have done it, and the Soviets did it.

825
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,520
 Their first use of dolphins by the Navy

826
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,200
 was in 1970 in Vietnam, where they were put on guard duty

827
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,760
 for the Americans.

828
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,760
 Was that river dolphins, or was it sea going dolphins?

829
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:19,600
 That's a really good point. I don't know about that.

830
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,840
 I don't know. It's actually the least relevant part

831
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,160
 of the most amazing fact I've ever heard, obviously.

832
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,400
 I mean, the dolphins fought in Nam

833
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,680
 is a more interesting factor,

834
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,520
 whether they were river or ocean dolphins.

835
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,760
 But you do get river dolphins in Vietnam.

836
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,080
 Yeah, I suspect there'd be river dolphins there,

837
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,400
 because it was the Mekong Delta and all that.

838
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,800
 So, I'm guessing there would be guarding

839
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,880
 certain entry and exit points.

840
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,800
 Fingers, Andy. You always ask the questions

841
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,480
 that the people at home are all thinking.

842
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:53,920
 And the Soviet Union, they used their dolphin guards.

843
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,560
 They would carry a titanium clump on their nose,

844
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,640
 which was about the size of a ping-pong ball.

845
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:02,640
 And they would attach it to a diver that they found.

846
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:07,280
 And the little kind of thing would report back

847
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,920
 and tell you where that person is, so you'd be able to find them.

848
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,840
 And if they couldn't find them, eventually,

849
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,520
 the ping-pong ball thing would inject

850
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,480
 a high-pressure charge of CO2 into the diver's body.

851
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,600
 Oh, so this is an enemy diver, is it?

852
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,520
 Well, like a U.S. diver or whatever.

853
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,480
 That's the idea, yeah.

854
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,920
 To tag them, and a guard.

855
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:30,080
 And again, I don't know exactly what species of dolphin it was.

856
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:36,800
 [music]

857
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,440
 OK, it's time for our final fact of the show.

858
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,560
 That is my fact.

859
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,520
 My fact this week is that the Arthakonin Doyle estate

860
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,480
 is currently suing Netflix for showing Sherlock Holmes

861
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,040
 as having feelings and respecting women.

862
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:54,640
 So this is really interesting.

863
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:59,040
 So Netflix is making a movie called Enola Holmes,

864
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:03,840
 and it is the story of the teenage sister of Sherlock Holmes,

865
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,160
 and Sherlock Holmes appears as a character in it.

866
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:10,000
 And in the show, they show him as having sort of

867
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
 not sociopath qualities that we know Sherlock to have,

868
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,080
 but to be warmer and gentler.

869
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,960
 And the Conan Doyle estate is claiming

870
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,800
 they are unable to represent him like that,

871
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,760
 because yes, even though Sherlock does have those feelings,

872
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,560
 he did eventually sort of respect women

873
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,040
 and become a nicer character.

874
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,680
 He only became that in the last 10 stories

875
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,840
 that were written by Conan Doyle.

876
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,920
 And it just so happens that those 10 stories

877
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,640
 are the only stories that are still in copyright

878
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,320
 and belong to the Conan Doyle estate.

879
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:43,280
 So anyone who wants to use the ad of copyright

880
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,400
 has to use the more mean, misogynistic Holmes,

881
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,280
 and they're fine.

882
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,200
 But if you want to show him being a nice guy,

883
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,400
 you're going to be sued.

884
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:50,640
 Wow.

885
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:54,320
 There's a few other things that you're not allowed to...

886
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:59,120
 Or if you do show Sherlock having these characteristics,

887
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,960
 then you have to pay them, pay the family.

888
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,680
 So if you show Holmes and Watson having a genuine friendship,

889
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,120
 that's in copyright.

890
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:10,080
 If you show his love of nature, that is.

891
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:14,000
 And if you ever show him liking dogs, that's in copyright.

892
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,480
 So if you ever make...

893
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,000
 I'm just going to say this to everyone out there.

894
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,480
 If you're making your own version of Sherlock Holmes,

895
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,720
 make sure that he doesn't like dogs whenever you do.

896
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:22,960
 Yeah.

897
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:27,200
 I guess the hand of the basketballs is out of copyright,

898
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,560
 in which he doesn't like dogs.

899
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,120
 No.

900
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,640
 No, it's quite right.

901
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,560
 And the thing is, if you are going to make

902
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,960
 something where he does like dogs and respects women,

903
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,840
 all you need to do actually is wait two or three more years,

904
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,120
 because that is...

905
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:41,760
 We're in the final years of them owning this copyright.

906
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,160
 I think that's why they're trying to rake in as much money

907
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,640
 as possible, because they're about to lose it entirely.

908
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:49,520
 But these stories obviously have...

909
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,360
 He wrote them over a lifetime.

910
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:54,640
 So there's a bit of spread on when the copyright ends.

911
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,280
 And the final batch, these final 10 were written

912
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,280
 after he returned from World War I,

913
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,880
 and he lost his brother in the war,

914
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,240
 he lost his eldest son,

915
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,760
 and he came back and he was a different man.

916
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,160
 And he thought, "I want to reflect that in Sherlock."

917
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,400
 And so that's why there was this sudden change

918
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,400
 in the attitude of Sherlock.

919
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,280
 It's interesting.

920
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,240
 Yeah, I got deep into the legalese of all this,

921
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:18,160
 because that's my background.

922
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,040
 So there's actually an in-fight between

923
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:24,080
 the Conan Doyle estate limited

924
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:26,720
 and Arthur Conan Doyle's literary estates,

925
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:32,160
 both of whom claim to have the copyright of those stories.

926
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,680
 And it's actually the Conan Doyle estate limited

927
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,880
 is the litigious one of those two.

928
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:42,400
 And so they are described by the literary estate

929
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,480
 as copyright trolls, which is a whole new tale.

930
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:50,080
 So tracing it back,

931
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:53,200
 the way that the story is told by the literary estate

932
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:59,040
 is that all the rights were sold after Conan Doyle's death

933
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,760
 because the three inheriting children,

934
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,480
 so it's two daughters and the widow of his son,

935
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:08,560
 couldn't agree on anything.

936
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,080
 So they all sold to the widow.

937
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:15,440
 And from then on, she went bankrupt

938
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,040
 and the rights were acquired by someone else

939
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,640
 who was acquired by someone else.

940
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,560
 And so they traced that route back.

941
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:26,800
 In 2000-ish, when EU copyright law started to indicate

942
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:30,080
 that there wasn't much money left to be squeezed out

943
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,400
 in Europe of the literary copyright,

944
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,160
 that's when Conan Doyle estate limited,

945
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,880
 which is some descendants of Conan Doyle himself

946
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:44,080
 decided to put the squeeze on some of the studios

947
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,440
 who are interested in his work.

948
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,160
 So they basically went and threatened Warner Brothers

949
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,200
 when they made the Robert Downey Jr. versions.

950
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:55,280
 And because in those films,

951
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,680
 he's got a romance with Irene Adler.

952
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,480
 There's all that sort of stuff that would come under

953
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,880
 the sort of stipulations.

954
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,680
 And the...

955
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,680
 I think it would be fair to threaten those filmmakers

956
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,160
 actually at the Robert Downey Jr. Sherlock Holmes

957
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,360
 in the game of Thanos movie.

958
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:14,400
 No, the people you want to threaten

959
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,920
 are the people who made Holmes and Watson.

960
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,000
 What? Oh, sorry.

961
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,960
 This is Dad's favourite film, The Will's Feral Sherlock Holmes.

962
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:21,760
 It's so good.

963
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:26,400
 Yeah, but nowhere in Holmes is he bloody hilarious.

964
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,280
 I think, oh, true.

965
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,080
 There you go.

966
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,320
 So that's actually more of a divergence

967
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,440
 from the original text.

968
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,400
 And I'm guessing that that studio paid them off.

969
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:39,200
 Do you know the, obviously, the very famous quote,

970
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,480
 "elementary, my dear Watson?"

971
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:46,160
 It never said in any of the written work of Conan Doyle's.

972
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,720
 So it's a line that came much later.

973
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,680
 But there's someone who runs a site called Quote Investigator

974
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,200
 who's written a fantastic article

975
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,920
 about trying to find the very first instances

976
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,640
 where we use "elementary, my dear Watson."

977
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:02,000
 And the oldest that he could find was 1901,

978
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,200
 the Northampton Mercury.

979
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,160
 They published a short parody featuring the characters

980
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,320
 Shylock Combs and Pottson.

981
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:13,600
 And it is in that that the line "elementary, my dear Pottson"

982
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:14,560
 is said.

983
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:15,440
 Wow.

984
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:19,120
 Then in 1902, there was a piece that was written

985
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:20,720
 about Dr. Joseph Bell.

986
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,440
 Now, Dr. Joseph Bell is someone who it is claimed

987
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,840
 was the inspiration for Sherlock Holmes.

988
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:28,400
 He was a doctor who could walk around and look at you

989
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,640
 on site and pick out what was wrong with you

990
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,080
 by just simply staring at you,

991
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:35,040
 which is a thing that Sherlock is famous for doing.

992
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,920
 And in this article, the person writing it says,

993
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,680
 "As the remarkable man would say,

994
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:42,560
 'It is the merest elementary knowledge, my dear Watson.'"

995
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:45,360
 So that's the second closest that we get to it.

996
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:45,920
 Yeah.

997
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,560
 But yeah, no one can find it in the actual canon itself

998
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,240
 of official Sherlock writings.

999
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,640
 I think if it was there, people would have found it, right?

1000
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:53,280
 Yeah.

1001
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:56,320
 Because people do take these books very seriously.

1002
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:57,440
 You're right.

1003
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:57,840
 You get people.

1004
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:58,880
 And they're all digital now.

1005
00:49:58,880 --> 00:49:59,680
 There's a search term.

1006
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:00,560
 Yeah, it's a search term.

1007
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:05,520
 I've got just a recommendation of an extraordinary

1008
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,640
 real-life story to do with Sherlock and Conan Doyle.

1009
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,520
 That is worth reading.

1010
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:13,920
 So it's written by a guy called David Gran.

1011
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,200
 And the story, it was published in The New Yorker

1012
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,280
 and it was called Mysterious Circumstances.

1013
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:23,200
 So basically, one of the leading Sherlock Holmes experts

1014
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,400
 in the world, living in Britain,

1015
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:31,760
 was found dead in his room, in his house, with no break-in.

1016
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:35,040
 No one could work out how anyone got out

1017
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,440
 because there was just one body in there.

1018
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,920
 So this turned in itself into a Sherlock Holmes-style mystery.

1019
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,480
 How did the leading expert of Sherlock Holmes die?

1020
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,400
 It was a guy called Richard Lancelin Green.

1021
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,800
 He was the son of Roger Lancelin Green,

1022
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,280
 who wrote The King Arthur Fables in their modern version,

1023
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,440
 with the most famous version that we would all know.

1024
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:56,480
 And yeah, so it's extraordinary.

1025
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,360
 He was found death by Garotting, by the way.

1026
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,200
 Oh, hello.

1027
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:01,200
 Hello.

1028
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,400
 And what year was this?

1029
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,680
 Did he say the year then?

1030
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:06,080
 No. Well, he wrote about it in 2004

1031
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:09,120
 and it wasn't much long before that that this story happened.

1032
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:12,480
 Did he have one of those guns that shoots people in the crotch?

1033
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:16,560
 Because then I'm just trying to channel my inner Sherlock Holmes here.

1034
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:20,720
 Yeah, I mean, I know the answer to the story, but it's not that.

1035
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,960
 Is that Doctor, what was he called?

1036
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,240
 Dr. Bell.

1037
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,360
 Bell.

1038
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:27,840
 Yeah, he could tell just by looking at you

1039
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,040
 if you'd been shot in the crotch.

1040
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,200
 This man is a Garotter. He's a nasty man.

1041
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:38,560
 Sorry, Dad, carry on.

1042
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:41,360
 No, no, I think that's all that I'd like to give in terms of details.

1043
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:42,880
 It's an extraordinary mystery.

1044
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,200
 Sherlock expert found Garotterd.

1045
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,560
 Yeah, in a locked room mystery, and he's the only person in the room,

1046
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,480
 no one knows who killed him.

1047
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:53,840
 There was a big paranoia on his part in the lead-up to his death

1048
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:57,920
 about people wanting to kill him that he told everyone about.

1049
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,000
 It's a big mystery and the story does resolve,

1050
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,120
 so I highly recommend reading it.

1051
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:03,200
 Oh, you're not going to tell us?

1052
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,520
 No, no, it's honestly, that's what I was saying.

1053
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,200
 This is just a, you need to read it.

1054
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,480
 It would be horrible to ruin the brilliance of this writing.

1055
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,000
 No spoilers.

1056
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,760
 So have you told people how to get hold of this, how to find it?

1057
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,080
 Yeah, the New Yorker, Mysterious Circumstances,

1058
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:21,680
 it's called by David Gran, or in the book The Devil vs. Sherlock Holmes.

1059
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,080
 But once we stop recording, you'll just tell us what happened, right?

1060
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:24,640
 Because...

1061
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,080
 Yes, absolutely.

1062
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:28,880
 It was a self, he put his cravat on the wrong way around, didn't he?

1063
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,960
 So easy.

1064
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:38,160
 OK, that's it.

1065
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,280
 That is all of our facts.

 Great guess.
