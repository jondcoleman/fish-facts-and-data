00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.360
 Hi everyone, we've got a very special, very exciting guest on the show today,

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:13.280
 someone we've wanted to get on for a long time. That's the brilliant comedian Paul Sinner.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.640
 He was absolutely hilarious on the show, as predicted. He is of course a comedian,

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.840
 as well as being a champion, quizzing mastermind on such things as The Chase,

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.160
 and he's got a book out with possibly the best title for a book ever,

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:35.360
 One Sinner Lifetime. See what he's done there? And that too is fantastic. It's very, very funny,

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:42.880
 it's also very moving, it's a memoir, it's about his really, truly fascinating and up and down life.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.960
 Would highly, highly recommend it. That's One Sinner Lifetime. Look it up, get it now.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.360
 Hope you enjoy the show. We had such a good time with him.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:01:09.120

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:15.120
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Things a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.160
 from the QI offices in Hobein. My name is Anna Tyshinski and I'm sitting here with

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.560
 Andrew Under Murray, James Harkin and very special guest Paul Sinner. Hi Paul.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.400
 Hello, this is very exciting for me. Finally made it through the door.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:36.400
 Well, it's great to have you and we are here again with our four favorite facts from the last seven

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.640
 days and in no particular order, here we go, starting with you, Paul.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.280
 Well, it's the Olympics at the moment and so this is tangentially collected to the Olympics.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.840
 I've always been fascinated by the Olympics and what it means to people,

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.600
 but I'm perhaps more fascinated by people who've taken part in the Olympics

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.320
 and it's nowhere near the biggest thing that's happened to them in their lives.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.960
 So this is a man called Michel de Carvalho and I can say with almost absolute certainty

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.880
 that you won't know that Michel de Carvalho was both a British Olympic skier and the British

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.800
 Olympic loser, but several years after his sport and career came to an end,

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.640
 he got absolutely lucky by marrying the person who is now the Netherlands richest,

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.560
 not woman, but person. The heir to the Heineken empire, Charlene de Heineken,

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.120
 he married her, so he's worth billions, which is good, but that's not the greatest fact about

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.240
 Michel de Carvalho. The greatest fact about Michel de Carvalho is he achieved a fame

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:41.120
 before he was an Olympian. He is the only surviving cast member of Lawrence of Arabia.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:47.040
 As a kid, he was a child actor, he appeared as Peter O'Toole's friend and child servant.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.040
 Faraj, I think his name was really weird, spelt differently.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.760
 And he's always sort of like sending other, like drives people back to the traditional

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.560
 land where they came from. He was in Lawrence of Arabia and he's not even that old now.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.000
 What's next to come? You know, he's done Lawrence of Arabia, Olympics,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.240
 married the richest person in the Netherlands. Strictly!

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.840
 That's it. That's the only thing left. It's the only mount left to conquer.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.720
 But it's part of a fascination to have with people for whom, oh yeah, they were in the

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.280
 Olympics as well. By the way.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.720
 By the way, as a sort of side category of things they've done.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.920
 I wonder what she's most proud of. I mean, I think in preparation for this, Andy, in fact,

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.120
 you may have browsed a bit of Lawrence of Arabia.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.720
 Yeah, Andy sent us a message, a WhatsApp at 11pm saying I've just started to watch Lawrence

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.240
 of Arabia and we know that 11pm has passed his bedtime anyway.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.720
 Already I was pushing, you know, I shouldn't have had the oval team before I started watching.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.120
 Were you searching for female characters?

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:56.320
 Not very long. Right, so just before we start, yes, okay, I am currently halfway through Lawrence

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.000
 of Arabia. If I'd been watching Rear Window, I would have finished it by now, but I wasn't.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.960
 I'm about two hours in and I'm watching the proper version, which is three hours 47.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.800
 So please can nobody spoil the end of the First World War for me? I don't want to know how it ends.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.280
 Happily.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.480
 There's a bit of a spoiler at the beginning though, isn't there?

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.000
 The film begins at the opening scene is him getting on his motorbike and then dying.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.640
 Oh, no way!

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.880
 And then there's a whipped pan back to it. Has anyone else seen Lawrence of Arabia?

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:19.520
 No.

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:20.480
 A long time ago.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:20.800
 Okay.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.240
 So when I was a kid I was made to watch it and I willfully forgotten it.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.280
 Do you remember this boy, Carvalho, this friend?

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.320
 He's a big character.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.040
 Oh, is he?

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.960
 Yeah, yeah, there are two sort of manservants or sort of like the kind of teenagers,

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.640
 the kids who are following him around and you know, they love him and they want to be with him.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.000
 They follow him into the desert on their camels. Oh my goodness, there are so many camels.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.440
 I'm sorry, if you like camels.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.840
 I mean, it fails the Beck Deltas tragically because the two female camels in it taught nothing

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.840
 nothing other than their love life.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.280
 There is not a single woman in it, like with a speaking role, right?

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.240
 Okay, so in the first half there's a bit where they're setting off into the desert, all the men,

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.040
 and there are some women seen wailing from a distance, but they're seen at such a distance

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.480
 that you can't tell. You really can't tell.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.680
 They could be men with wigs.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.600
 They're shot in silhouette as well and from behind.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.440
 I mean, yeah, those are the only female voices that have made their way into the film so far.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.760
 I think, because as you mentioned, you watched the proper one and there are various versions.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.720
 And I think in the longest one, which was released in about the early 80s, I think,

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.280
 which was the original one that David Lean wanted to release,

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.760
 I think there are some women in the big massacre scene.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.120
 Apparently there are some female corpses.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.600
 Maybe they'll do a remake, you know, like with Ghostbusters.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.560
 An all-female.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.160
 All-female Lawrence of Arabia.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:36.640
 I love it.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.560
 Laura of Arabia.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.160
 Well, that was one of the famous quotes about it.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.800
 It was after the premiere, I think it was Noel Coward.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.120
 He approached Peter O'Toole, who is unbelievably good looking in the right.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.600
 He's really, he's just sort of beautiful.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.520
 And Noel Coward went up to him and said,

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.240
 "If you'd been any pretty, they'd have had to call it Florence of Arabia."

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.920
 But it is very good, though.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:58.960
 It's very good.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.640
 It's a cinematic masterpiece, but it's not one you'd watch twice.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.760
 No, it's one of those ones where you watch it and you're like,

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.360
 "Oh, that's where they got Dune from."

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.800
 "Oh, that's where Star Wars comes from."

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.520
 "Oh, Mad Max."

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.200
 That's all like, it's all, you just, yeah, yeah, you can see it sort of.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.840
 You just named a bunch of films that are sort of set in the desert.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:16.480
 Are you just saying that?

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.960
 Priscilla.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.160
 Film by Louise.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:22.960
 Yeah, okay.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:23.920
 Yeah, yeah.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.440
 One of the things that Lawrence of Arabia is responsible for is The King of Jordan.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.000
 This is nice.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.480
 Oh, yeah.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.400
 So I think Current King of Jordan was conceived as a result of this film.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.920
 Did you find out how that effect on you, Andy?

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.280
 That's a long time, isn't it? Three and a half hours.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.720
 You get bored.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.280
 Oh, another camel.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.480
 There's genuinely one camel journey which takes 40 minutes.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.440
 Is there?

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.720
 And it's with brief interruptions for conversation, but it is almost all camel.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.920
 I don't know what you're expecting from a film called Lawrence of Arabia.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.680
 No, you're right, you're right, you're right, you're right.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.040
 It's not enough car chasers.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.520
 Well, it starts with a very exciting motorbike scene.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.080
 Yeah, true.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:58.720
 Oh, great.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:59.760
 It's just going to be chopper action.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:00.400
 No.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.160
 So The King of Jordan's parents looked at it, speaking of humps, darling.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:04.240
 Brilliant.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.040
 And then...

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.800
 It's King Hussein of Jordan, the previous one.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.560
 He had lent a load of his soldiers to the film.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:13.280
 So lots of the people you see as extras in the film playing soldiers are soldiers from the Jordanian army.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.560
 And he visited the set because he was very keen, he was an enthusiast,

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:21.440
 and he fell for a young woman, a British secretary who was working on the film.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.160
 Obviously not in front of the camera.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.200
 She was called Antoinette, and they got married in 1962.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.880
 The other film came out, and their eldest son became the King of Jordan in 1999.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.280
 Abdullah, Abdullah II.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.920
 Yeah, so that's a happy ending.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:42.080
 So the movie's based on a book, Seven Pillars of Wisdom, which is T. E. Lawrence is...

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.360
 Biography.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.600
 Biography, yeah.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.360
 Yeah, we should say he was a real guy.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:47.440
 Yeah.

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.760
 Just in case any listeners don't know who T. E. Lawrence was.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:55.120
 He was a British intelligence officer, and he'd been an archaeologist and a photographer in Arabia.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.280
 He loved the area so much.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.720
 And then during the war, he joined the army, became an intelligence officer.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:04.320
 And his big thing was, he was lobbying for Arabian independence,

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:08.400
 but it turned out that sort of the British and French had already kind of carved up the area.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.960
 There was an agreement called the Sykes-Picot Agreement,

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:14.240
 and sort of dividing the Arabian world into spheres of influence.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.600
 So he felt very, very let down after the war,

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.160
 because his Arabian calls had been betrayed,

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.800
 and he felt like he'd let everyone down.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.800
 But he's a really, really interesting guy.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.640
 And what happened to that Sykes-Picot Agreement?

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.000
 I believe it all ended up well in the end.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 Have you seen Lawrence of Arabia 2?

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:32.640
 It's the one.

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.400
 There is one, genuinely.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.520
 There's a sequel film.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.320
 There's Ghost Emerges from the Motorcycle Show.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:43.600
 It's called A Dangerous Man, Lawrence after Arabia.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.880
 Straight to video, early '90s.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.720
 It's him in Paris.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.800
 It's Lawrence in Paris, basically.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.760
 Guess who plays?

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:55.680
 This is just a casting guess, Lawrence, in the '90s version of Lawrence of Arabia.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.480
 Paul Nicholas.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:00.480
 Was he in East Anas?

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.640
 Paul Nichols!

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.360
 He was my first ever crush.

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.800
 Paul Nicholas from Just Good Friends.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:05.280
 Oh, for God's sake.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.160
 Not Paul Nichols.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.200
 Although they're both in East Anas.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.320
 But what actually was Ross Kemp?

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:08.960
 You're very close.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.000
 No, no, no.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.200
 Paul was a Ross Kemp.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:16.080
 It's perfect casting for if you're trying to cast piss and blue wines, golden, shimmering hair.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:27.200
 Pats sharp. Pats sharp. G-doll. Oh, close. Rayfines. Oh, Rayfines. Oh, and it's like very young, very handsome Rayfines being, you know, right.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:32.480
 The real Lawrence of Arabia looked nothing like that. It was five foot five, very unprepossessing looking. I don't see it really. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:40.480
 Just on the film Lawrence of Arabia, which I think was much more fun to be involved in than the actual being Lawrence of Arabia, they had a way out of a time.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:50.480
 Peter O'Toole and Omar Sharif had so much fun together and ended up great friends and Peter O'Toole, who claims he slept with 1,033 women in his life,

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:58.480
 drew to form on that film. Him and Omar Sharif had women flown out for them at weekends. Yeah, well, there were none present at that time.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:06.480
 They must have been so gutted when they took the first look at the cast. You are kidding me. Oh, no, these are all camels. Sorry.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:14.480
 They are all called flossing, but they are all camels. No, they did. They had a great time and Omar Sharif sounds like such a fun character.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:22.480
 He was from Egypt and he was sent to a British school there because he was fat and the British food was so bad. His parents thought this will get him thin.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.480
 That's schools in the world.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:38.480
 His grandson said he had two areas of expertise, bridge and sex, and he actually taught his grandson about the birds and the bees, and he said, "Making love is like playing bridge. You either need an incredible partner or a really good hand."

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:52.480
 When I was a kid, I think he did the bridge column in the Sunday Times magazine. Really? Did he? No way. When I say he played bridge, he played bridge. I mean, he's one of the best players in the world.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.480
 No way. Oh, no. That is a proper polymath.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:11:04.480
 Is it Olympians? Yeah. Yeah. Unusual, weird Olympians? Yeah, go for it. Bob Anderson? The dance player? No.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:16.480
 You know so many people, Paul. I know. It's interesting. Bob Anderson, the world darts champion of the late 80s or early 90s. He was a junior javelin for us. I thought maybe I missed the fact that you'd gone to the Olympics.

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:25.480
 No. Actually, I know where you're going with this, Andy, because I found this as well. We're looking for someone who used an item which is longer than a dart and shorter than a javelin.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:33.480
 Yes. A knife and fork. He did eating at the Olympics. But the same shape as both. Yes. God, that's a very good clue. Yeah, yeah.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:41.480
 I'm just, my mind is blown from the fact there's a Bob Anderson who did darts and javelin. What the hell? And then there's someone in the middle who did something in between.

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:52.480
 So this Bob Anderson, who's not a dart or a javelin player, he was an Olympic... Fencer. Bingo. Yeah. And he was also in a movie doing what? Lightsabers. Bingo. Correct.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:12:00.480
 You played Darth Vader. Oh, wow. That's why I don't name him. Wow. He did all the fight scenes with the lightsaber in the big costume.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:12.480
 I think I would like to see Darth Vader throwing darts, actually. Darth Vader? And there's his nickname for the ockie. Brilliant. How did I not get that?

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:19.480
 And did they hire him solely on his fencing skills? Because I suppose Darth Vader, he doesn't have a face, does he? So he always faces cover. So you don't need to be able to act.

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:28.480
 Well, he was a major Hollywood sword fighting choreographer. So he did loads and loads. He would choreograph fights and sometimes he did the fights himself if it was a costume thing, and it was because he'd been a fencer in his...

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:37.480
 He worked on the three musketeers, the Princess Bride, the Mask of Zorro, Lord of the Rings and Die Another Day. Oh, which were all inspired by Lawrence of Arabia, weren't they? Yes.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:50.480
 Odd job in Goldfinger. Yeah, I know about that one. Was he an Olympian? Yeah. 1948. Another famous darts throw, right? Hold on. Was it him who threw darts? 48. He throws his hat. He throws his hat. Sorry. Discus.

00:12:50.480 --> 00:13:02.480
 That's not exactly how you throw a discus, how he throws his hat. He sort of curls it. He throws it frisbee style. Otherwise, a frisbee discus is the other way round. So he was a weightlifter, wasn't he? Yeah, that's right.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:23.480
 Silver medalist, actually. Silver medalist, '48. I always like how... Who's the guy in the Goonies? The... "Hey, you guys!" That guy, he was an American football player and won two Super Bowls. The guy who plays... Is it Chunk? I've not seen the Goonies. Have you not seen the Goonies? Oh, no. Okay, if you want to see classics. The Goonies.

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:43.480
 Alan Turing. Almost an Olympian. Turing. Very close. Chess. Chess. Yeah, no, actually. He was a pretty fast runner. He came fifth in the Amateur Athletics Association Marathon in 1948, almost qualifying him for the Olympics. And he actually did beat in a running race the silver medalist that year.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:57.480
 Wow. What year? '48. '48 is a big year. It was Andre Agassiz's dad boxed for Iran. Andre Agassiz's dad represented Iran at boxing in 1948.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:09.480
 I remember, Paul, you posted on social media once about Andre Agassiz and Ginger Rogers. What's that place? Ginger Rogers played in the US Open tennis mix doubles.

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:19.480
 Did she look backwards and then high heels? It's really bizarre. She wasn't that good a tennis player. She just happened to take part one year.

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:29.480
 And her partner was Brooke Shields' grandfather. He was married to Andre Agassiz. Something really, really odd.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:50.480
 So, sorry, 1948 had odd job. Andre Agassiz's dad. Was odd job '48? '48. Andre Agassiz's dad was '48. Yaroslav Drobny, who won Wimbledon for Egypt, were men's singles for Egypt in the '50s, played ice hockey for Czechoslovakia in '48.

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:55.480
 We are getting more obscure now, aren't we? And almost Alan Turing. Almost Alan Turing.

00:14:55.480 --> 00:15:02.480
 And then I've managed to find somebody who was in the Olympics in 1948. And it's not even mentioned on his Wikipedia page.

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:15.480
 A guy called Andre Vortikin, who is an engineer who designed the Atomium in Brussels. The man who designed the Atomium in Brussels played field hockey for Belgium in the 1948 Olympics.

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:22.480
 And the first ever international no such thing as a fish gig was the Atomium in Brussels. We brought it home.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:27.480
 And we think it's based on an atom, but it's actually just six hockey balls in it, apparently.

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:47.480
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact. My fact this week is that Samuel L. Jackson once locked Martin Luther King's dad in an upstairs room, then gave him a ladder to escape out of the window.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:59.480
 We're back to connections. Yes. Oh, yeah. So this is a Morehouse College, which is a black American college, and there was a student protest there, and Samuel L. Jackson.

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:09.480
 He's a very active student, and he's protesting at the idea that it's his black college, but they're being sort of groomed to be very successful in a very mainstream kind of white society way.

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:17.480
 So it's extremely high achievement Morehouse College. You know, it's turned out extraordinary people. And I think the demands were things like, look, we want a black studies program.

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:21.480
 We want a black board of trustees involved with black communities.

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:27.480
 So a black board of trustees, not a black board of trustees. It is an educational establishment.

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:35.480
 That's where the confusion arose. And so they bought loads of black boards and then, yes, a black space board of trustees.

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:41.480
 And anyway, they decided the best way to achieve this is to kidnap the members of the board and one of them was Martin Luther King's dad.

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:52.480
 And so they kidnap them and they locked them upstairs. I think it was two stories up and they bought padlocks and they took chains from keep off the grass signs on campus to sort of padlock them in.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:17:03.480
 And then Martin Luther King's dad Martin Luther King senior started getting chest pains and quite heartlessly in the interview I read with Samuel L. Jackson, he was like, well, look, we didn't want to unlock any of the doors because the protest had to go on.

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:14.480
 So instead they got the ladder that the neighbouring girls school had used to climb up to that window as part of the process, put it up to the window, sit to him, slide down that mate, take yourself to a doctor.

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:16.480
 And so he did.

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:21.480
 And they were connected. Samuel L. Jackson and the King family, weren't they?

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:22.480
 Yeah, they were.

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:27.480
 I know he was at the funeral. He was at the funeral. He was a Paul Bearer, Samuel L. Jackson at Martin Luther King's funeral.

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:32.480
 Because he'd been involved in student protest and student politics and black activism and all that kind of stuff.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:37.480
 It all happened at this college. He was very politically active. Samuel L. Jackson for a while.

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:41.480
 He was actually made to leave Atlanta because the FBI were after him.

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:42.480
 Really?

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:49.480
 This amazing story where the FBI came and knocked on his mum's door and they said, get your son out of Atlanta or someone's going to kill him.

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:52.480
 And he went to LA and that was sort of where he picked up some show business.

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:55.480
 That's amazing. All I know about him is he likes playing golf.

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:56.480
 Does he?

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:57.480
 Yes he does.

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:58.480
 Have you got a list?

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:06.480
 I know one very important fact about him, which is that when I was on a final chase once, I was asked what is Samuel L. Jackson's middle name.

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:13.480
 And I went, Leroy, and Bradley said, correct. And I've never felt more ashamed of getting a question right in the first little show.

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:19.480
 I felt I'd been rewarded for racially stereotyping in a way that didn't justify reward.

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:26.480
 He had a stutter as a child as well. He said that the one word that he says to get him out of a stutter is...

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.480
 Oh, I know what this is.

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:29.480
 Snakes?

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:30.480
 Snakes!

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:33.480
 Is that what you associate Samuel L. Jackson with?

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.480
 What's the word you associate with snakes?

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:36.480
 Snakes on a plane.

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.480
 Okay, what's the other word?

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:40.480
 I've got to get these snakes off this plane.

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:41.480
 Oh, I see.

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:42.480
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:48.480
 These days he doesn't stutter as much, but if he ever does start stuttering, all he has to do is say that word and it will get him out of it.

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:52.480
 Okay, I've read this on his IMDb. It's that he has his own weed consultant.

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.480
 Oh, yeah.

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:59.480
 I did a little bit of digging. I don't think it's his own weed consultant because I don't think he's on an exclusive contract with Samuel L. Jackson.

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:00.480
 Okay.

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.480
 No, he does weeks for loads of people, doesn't he?

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:06.480
 He does weeks for loads of people. He's had lots and lots of on-screen hairdos.

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:11.480
 If you say my agent, they might be agents for other people as well, but they're still your agent.

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:12.480
 That's true.

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:16.480
 Yes, but if I said I have a plumber, it'd be weird.

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:20.480
 Wait, what do you mean? The same thing applies, Andy. Your own plumber is not exclusive to you, is he?

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:22.480
 Yeah, you say my plumber came round.

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:26.480
 It would be weird if someone wrote a fact sheet about me saying he has his own plumber.

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:29.480
 That's a guy for you.

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:32.480
 Elton John is probably the only person I can imagine has his own plumber.

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.480
 Yeah, exactly.

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:37.480
 Not even the king. Elton John.

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:42.480
 Anyway, so I looked up this guy, this hair consultant and stylist, and he's worked for loads of famous people.

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:46.480
 Anyway, his name is Robert L. Stevenson. Guess what the L stands for?

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:47.480
 It's Louis.

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.480
 No.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.480
 He's Robert Louis Stevenson.

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:50.480
 That's brilliant.

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.480
 Yes, he is named after the Treasure Island author.

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:53.480
 Is he really?

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:54.480
 Yeah.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:57.480
 Well, you must be. Like, there's no way you would accidentally come up with that name.

00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.480
 He was only the third male hairstylist in the Hollywood Union.

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:01.480
 Really?

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:02.480
 Yeah.

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:05.480
 So, just stick that in your pipe and swipe, yeah.

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.480
 I could have sworn he was the first. You think you know a subject?

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:10.480
 It's amazing what you learn on this show, isn't it?

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:11.480
 Just do it.

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:16.480
 On a more serious note, I didn't realise until I was reading about him that his life was in ruins, wasn't it?

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:22.480
 I did just cocaine and heroin. It made me think that perhaps that's what we need to be doing for all drug addicts.

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.480
 Make them into Hollywood stars.

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:25.480
 Make them into film stars, was it?

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:28.480
 Are you saying you should go down to the job centre?

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:34.480
 Or at the job centre, when people come to you, they say, "I'm in a real difficult place, addicted to drugs, I'm unemployed."

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:37.480
 The advice should be, have you considered becoming a film star?

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:38.480
 Yeah.

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.480
 What jobs have you got?

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.480
 Well, we've got a role playing Prince Faisal.

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:42.480
 No.

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.480
 I'll play Lawrence, thank you very much.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:48.480
 And the other thing is he wasn't considered an especially good actor until he got into films.

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:51.480
 His career wasn't really going anywhere in particular.

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:52.480
 Who, SLJ?

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:53.480
 SLJ.

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:56.480
 From SLJ to MLK, yeah.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:57.480
 Good segue.

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:58.480
 Nice, nice.

00:20:58.480 --> 00:20:59.480
 Love it.

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:06.480
 He tried to get sent to school a year early and was foiled by the teacher when he accidentally mentioned that it was his fifth birthday was coming up.

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:09.480
 Was he responsible for registering himself?

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:15.480
 Was it like those First World War things where you say, "I'm 14," and they say, "I'll walk around the block," and so tell me your rating when you come back?

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:16.480
 Well, it's nice to know that.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:19.480
 If he was, then he's proved that he's precocious enough to do it in the first place.

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:21.480
 Exactly. They put him straight into sixth form.

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:26.480
 I was him and his dad senior, in fact, sort of plotted together to get him let in because he was keen to go to school.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:30.480
 Was he keen to go to school or was his dad keen to get him out of the house?

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:34.480
 Because I couldn't think of any reason I would send my daughter to school early and that would be it.

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:35.480
 He kept telling us dad about his dreams.

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:36.480
 So annoying.

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:38.480
 No one cares.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:40.480
 Other people's dreams. Boring.

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:43.480
 He said his main weaknesses were food and women, so there's...

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:44.480
 50% there.

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:47.480
 Wow.

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.480
 Which pissed off his dad, actually.

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:51.480
 He said this is a grown man, not a five-year-old.

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:54.480
 Because there's a five-year-old boy said that to me, "You'd call the social, wouldn't you?"

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.480
 He was precocious.

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:59.480
 No, he had a lot of affairs, didn't he?

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:01.480
 He did. And he loved to dance.

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:02.480
 Food, women, dancing.

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:06.480
 Loved to dance the jitterbug, which I think women have talked about the fact it was very controversial,

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:11.480
 and his dad once cringe turned up when he was dancing the jitterbug in front of a bunch of women,

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:14.480
 seized him and dragged him off the dance floor.

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:15.480
 Wow.

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:17.480
 This is another really bizarre connection.

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:21.480
 Much like the King of Jordan being due to Lawrence of Arabia.

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:22.480
 Abdullah II.

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:23.480
 Yep.

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.480
 Fortunately, the King is responsible for Julia Roberts' existing.

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:26.480
 Is that true?

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:27.480
 It is.

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:29.480
 So someone had sex while he was doing this speech?

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.480
 He, no.

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:37.480
 I had a dream that Richard Gere came along.

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:40.480
 He paid for the hospital bill when she was born.

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.480
 Really?

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:44.480
 He's not responsible for her being born, but her parents are.

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:48.480
 But he paid it because her parents had an acting school in Atlanta,

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:51.480
 and they had been very welcoming to King's own children.

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:53.480
 So the families knew each other.

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:57.480
 And so when Julia Roberts was born, Martin Luther King stumped up for the bills.

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:59.480
 See, he's contributed so much.

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:00.480
 Yeah.

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:01.480
 Yeah.

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:05.480
 The non-violence sort of element of King's philosophy was really interesting.

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:09.480
 The Montgomery Bus Boycott was a really famous one of his campaigns,

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:12.480
 and it wasn't initially planned as a Gandhi-style campaign of non-violence,

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:18.480
 but after the Rosa Parks, after she was arrested on the bus,

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.480
 the campaign was kind of adjusted.

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:23.480
 And he hadn't originally known much about Gandhi or Gandhi's campaigns,

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.480
 which were famously non-violent.

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:26.480
 He had lots of guns, for example.

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:30.480
 He once applied for a permit to carry a concealed weapon,

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:33.480
 because he was very worried about his safety, correct?

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:37.480
 But once in 1962, at one of his events, one of his rallies,

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:44.480
 a 200-pound white Nazi party member called Roy James jumped on stage and hit him in the face,

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:49.480
 at which point he lowered his hands and kept talking and spoke calmly

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:52.480
 and didn't try to protect himself, even when he was hit again.

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:57.480
 Roy James is quite striking reading about the extent of his commitment to non-violence

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.480
 and showing non-violence in front of a large audience.

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:03.480
 I mean, I'm not going to defend this man, but 200 pounds is not that big.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:05.480
 No, you're right, it's not actually.

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:09.480
 I don't know, I'm sorry, I fat-shamed a Nazi, and I shouldn't have done...

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.480
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, fair enough.

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:14.480
 Wow, why have I come out as the bad guy?

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:18.480
 As someone who's been 200 pounds, I take a massive offense for it.

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:21.480
 I actually, I don't know what 200 pounds is in old money.

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:23.480
 14, 14 stone four.

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:24.480
 Oh, that's nothing.

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:25.480
 Okay, sorry.

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:29.480
 200 pounds is old money, it's just lower denominations, isn't it?

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:30.480
 Okay, okay.

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:32.480
 It's just got divided by 14.

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:35.480
 Sorry, I wouldn't have bothered saying a 14 stone.

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:38.480
 Nazi party members, that's totally ordinary.

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:41.480
 In fact, Mylith King may have been bigger, we don't know.

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:44.480
 Okay, personally, I still think it's impressive.

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.480
 But I take your point, everybody, thank you.

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:50.480
 The way my brain works is, well, I can't get rid of the fact that the march,

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:53.480
 depicting the film Selma, the march from Selma to Montgomery,

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:58.480
 is the most famous march that was from one Simpsons character to another Simpsons case.

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:01.480
 That's such a good point.

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:04.480
 That's what it was really about.

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:05.480
 That's very funny.

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:08.480
 I just have a thing on random celebrity connections.

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:09.480
 Yeah.

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:13.480
 Actually, it feels so trivory, I wonder if Paul knows about it.

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:15.480
 Do you know what the Erdos Bacon number is?

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:18.480
 Oh yeah, Paul Erdos, the mathematician in Kevin Bacon.

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:20.480
 Yeah, this is so cool.

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:23.480
 The star of Footloose, and the possible reason I'm gay.

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.480
 Interesting.

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:28.480
 Having watched Footloose at a very tender moment in my life.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.480
 Yeah, it's a combination, isn't it?

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:34.480
 And someone really famous has got an Erdos Bacon number of two or three.

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:36.480
 Is it Natalie Portman?

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:40.480
 That's so good, it's not two or three would be a lot, but Natalie Portman, yes.

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:41.480
 Isn't it, you add them together?

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:42.480
 Yeah.

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:46.480
 So it's like if you've been in a paper with Paul Erdos, or someone who's been in a paper with him,

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:50.480
 or if you've been in a film with Kevin Bacon, or someone who's been in a film with Kevin Bacon.

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:54.480
 Exactly, so how many connections do you make between Paul Erdos and Kevin Bacon?

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:59.480
 And as you say, Natalie Portman has an Erdos Bacon number of, I think it's seven,

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:05.480
 but it's still good, because she's the only celebrity I could find who was a genuine academic,

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:09.480
 and that's her connection, because she actually wrote a paper when she was in school.

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.480
 There is another one as well, it's much more obscure.

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:13.480
 She played Winnie in the Wonder Years.

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:19.480
 I'm pretty sure that the actress who played Winnie in the Wonder Years has an Erdos number of some description.

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:21.480
 Is she the one with dark hair in the Wonder Years?

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:22.480
 I think so, yeah.

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.480
 She's the reason that I'm straight.

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:28.480
 Because that was on when I was like five years old or something.

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:33.480
 And is she an academic, or was she like, was there a consultant on the film or something?

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:37.480
 She's definitely done a maths paper, either with him or one connection to him.

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:42.480
 Cool, because I thought the most furious one was Colin Firth, who has an Erdos Bacon number of six,

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:50.480
 because he's credited as co-author of a neuroscience paper after he suggested on Radio 4 that a study could be done about it.

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:53.480
 So he mentioned Radio 4, hey, so much a look into this.

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:57.480
 The title is 'Political Orientations Are Correlated With Brain Structure And Young Adults'.

00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:00.480
 So I haven't actually heard a bit about Radio 4, but I'm guessing he says,

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:03.480
 oh, I wonder if people with different political views, his brains look different.

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.480
 Shall we talk about mine?

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:07.480
 And they've credited him as co-author, yes.

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:09.480
 That's fair enough. You came up with the thing.

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:10.480
 Oh, okay, okay.

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:12.480
 Credits are credit.

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:16.480
 One of Martin Luther King's long-term lovers was Dot Cotton.

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:17.480
 What?

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:18.480
 Excuse me?

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.480
 Her name was Dot Cotton. Her name was Dorothy Cotton.

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:23.480
 It wasn't Dot Cotton from EastEnders.

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:27.480
 I think her is the sort of reason that you're straight, Andy, someone like her.

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:38.480
 Okay, it's time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:43.480
 My fact is that top football teams sometimes travel with their own grass.

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:46.480
 And you're referring to the drug?

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:47.480
 Oh, no.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:48.480
 The surface.

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:51.480
 Oh, or I was thinking of people who tell tales.

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:52.480
 Oh, yeah!

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:54.480
 Their own copper's-nark.

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:58.480
 I would say John Terry was probably one.

00:27:58.480 --> 00:27:59.480
 Oh, yeah.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:02.480
 Do you reckon they had the feel of a copper's-nark about it?

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:05.480
 It's probably a long-term undercover copper.

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:08.480
 Try to expose, I don't know, socialism.

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:10.480
 No, this is so weird.

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:13.480
 Okay, so this happened just now. We've had a tournament, right?

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:14.480
 What was it, the Euros?

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:16.480
 We don't like to talk about it, but yeah, it was the Euros.

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:18.480
 But you did it right, didn't you?

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:19.480
 Yeah.

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:20.480
 Anyway.

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:21.480
 Are you being Scottish now?

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:22.480
 I think I am.

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:24.480
 Oh, well, you don't want to be Scottish in the Euros.

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.480
 This was an initiative by the FA.

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:30.480
 So they had a pitch in Blankenheim, which is where their training camp was.

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:34.480
 And that was seeded in April, some months ago, with turf that was used in London.

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:37.480
 And I guess it was London Seed, as well, Wembley Seed.

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:41.480
 It was a full-size pitch, fertilised level, given a haircut.

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:42.480
 So they were training on...

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:43.480
 Isn't that strange?

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:46.480
 Why wouldn't you train on what you're actually going to play on?

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:47.480
 Well, exactly.

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:49.480
 I think it's pathetic, to be honest.

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:53.480
 I think if you can't play on a range of surfaces, what's the point?

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:55.480
 Like, what's the point of this?

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:57.480
 How they've not got you as a sports pun bit.

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.480
 It's so sick, especially with Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.480
 That was quite Roy Keane, though, wasn't it?

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:04.480
 That's pathetic.

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:05.480
 Yeah.

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:06.480
 But it worked.

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:08.480
 Regardless of the logic, it worked.

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.480
 That's a good point, because they did very well.

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:12.480
 What a huge waste.

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:15.480
 Well, I mean, I'm sure that grass is now being enjoyed at this hotel,

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:16.480
 or golf resort, or whatever it was.

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:18.480
 What was there before?

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:20.480
 Probably some different grass.

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:21.480
 Oh, yeah, sorry.

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:23.480
 I'm not sure people are enjoying it anymore.

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:26.480
 They ship that grass over to Wembley Stadium.

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:29.480
 It's now only good for golfing, actually, because it was a golf resort.

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:32.480
 The different grass makes a big difference in golf, I have to say.

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:37.480
 If you go to play golf in Florida, and they have what's called Bermuda grass,

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:39.480
 and then you play in Scotland, it's very different feel.

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:41.480
 And you're normally in the rough, aren't you, though, James?

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:44.480
 If you're not in the bunker, you're in the sort of long grassy bits at the edge,

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:45.480
 hacking away.

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:48.480
 Don't try the golf banter with me, young man.

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:49.480
 Sorry.

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:52.480
 But it's much sort of more tangly, and it's got more of a grain to it.

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:55.480
 So if you try and hit against the grain in Bermuda grass,

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:58.480
 then it's actually quite difficult to get the club through the ball.

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:01.480
 Whereas if you play in Fescue in Scotland, it's really easy.

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:02.480
 It's very short.

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:05.480
 It's not stopping the Americans from winning in Scotland.

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:06.480
 No.

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:08.480
 Gentlemen, last open.

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:09.480
 Hang on.

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:10.480
 Sorry, aren't you hitting off the tee anyway?

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:11.480
 Aren't you hitting the bunker grass?

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:14.480
 You hit your first shot off the tee, but then future shots, you don't hit off the tee.

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:15.480
 Do you know what?

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.480
 I thought you were allowed to put a pop of tee in the ground.

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:18.480
 Oh, my God.

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:21.480
 How many times have I spoken about golf on this podcast?

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:23.480
 My filters are incredible by now.

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:25.480
 The shot has come down.

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:27.480
 You've learned nothing.

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:28.480
 Oh, dear.

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:30.480
 Do you want to know something ironic about pitches?

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:31.480
 Oh, yeah.

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:32.480
 Football pitches.

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:36.480
 An uneven pitch creates a level playing field.

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:37.480
 Oh, very good.

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:39.480
 Oh, why?

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:43.480
 Maybe the best footballer is good at playing on level playing fields.

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:44.480
 Exactly.

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:45.480
 Very even pitches.

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:46.480
 Exactly.

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:48.480
 It's a classic sort of FA cup thing, isn't it?

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:50.480
 You get a lower division team with a terrible pitch,

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:54.480
 and then the big shot charlies have to go and play in it, and they can't cope.

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:58.480
 Yeah, because you've got to do, you know, you rely on extremely fast, precise passing,

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:00.480
 so the flatter, more even the pitch.

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:03.480
 You've not washed England recently.

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:06.480
 Oh, even I got that.

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:10.480
 But yeah, as soon as you're on a less even pitch, then it sort of equalises people

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:14.480
 because it's a little bit bumpy, it's a little bit harder to get those very fast passes in.

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:17.480
 And it is a hugely refined art, isn't it?

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:19.480
 The pitch and grass maintenance in football.

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:24.480
 I think there was a manager, Laurent Blanc, who was managing Paris Saint-Germain in 2013.

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:27.480
 All his players were getting injured, they were doing badly,

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:30.480
 and they hired a groundsman called Jonathan Calderwood,

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:34.480
 and Laurent Blanc credited Calderwood with 16 of that club's points

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:37.480
 by the end of the season when they won the next season.

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:38.480
 And he was from Paris Saint-Germain?

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:39.480
 Yes.

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:44.480
 How many points did he attribute to the massive amount of money they got from Qatar?

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:46.480
 It didn't need to, actually.

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:50.480
 But no, it is a hugely advanced science.

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.480
 And it is actually one of the things where Britain is world leading,

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:55.480
 is the field of groundskeeping and turf consultancy.

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:59.480
 Why is it Cristiano mentioning this in his speech?

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:01.480
 It's changed Wimbledon, though, isn't it? The tennis.

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:07.480
 The tennis as a tournament has been transformed by the fact that the grass is not as fast as it once was.

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:08.480
 Absolutely, yeah.

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:14.480
 When we were all growing up, you'd have huge 6'6", 6'7" serve volleyers who'd smash the ball,

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:19.480
 come to the net, volley it. No one volleys anymore, because the balls slow down in the grass,

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:24.480
 and people just hit the ball straight back at them, and pass them.

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:29.480
 And it's like a better game, right? Would you say, objectively, it's kind of more interesting?

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:33.480
 I think it's gone too far the other way, and if there's a serve and volleyer,

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:36.480
 I'd like to see them do well, just because it's now a refreshing change.

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:39.480
 And do you know that also they think it's like a group think thing,

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:44.480
 but everyone assumed that serve and volley wouldn't work as well on this bouncy, slower grass.

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:48.480
 But actually, I think if you do choose the serve and volley,

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:51.480
 I think you're still proportionally winning the same number of points as you were before,

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:52.480
 so they should go back to it.

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:53.480
 Should they?

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:55.480
 And one does miss the serve and volley.

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:57.480
 A women's game, it's almost disappeared.

00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:58.480
 Yeah, yeah.

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:05.480
 The serve and volley, the Navratilovers, and the various East European checks of the 80s and 90s,

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:07.480
 all serve and volleyed, they've all gone.

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:09.480
 They've been lost in the long grass.

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:10.480
 Very strong.

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:12.480
 You know, they vacuum it, Wimbledon.

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:14.480
 They vacuum the grass every day.

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:18.480
 They've got a turf consultant, they measure the chlorophyll index.

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:19.480
 Yeah, they do.

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:21.480
 This is all part of the British groundskeeping revolution.

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:24.480
 And British groundskeepers go all over the world.

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:27.480
 That's the thing, it's like, okay, if you win the Euros,

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:29.480
 if you're Spain, fine, you've won the Euros, great.

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:32.480
 But no one can play without a pitch.

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:33.480
 Right.

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:36.480
 And if we, as Britain, are making the best pitches,

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:38.480
 who is the most important team in that tournament?

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:39.480
 Exactly.

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:40.480
 Exactly.

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:41.480
 And there should be points.

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:43.480
 We should probably start two goals ahead.

00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:45.480
 Just because of our contribution, right?

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:48.480
 But the sad thing about Wimbledon grass is that when you're watching it,

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:50.480
 it is in the process of dying.

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:52.480
 In fact, one of the Wimbledon groundskeepers said,

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:56.480
 you're walking the line between life and death when you maintain that grass.

00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:58.480
 All right, okay.

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:02.480
 You're the one who's elevated them, just sort of a global renowned status.

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:04.480
 Let me give you a test on football, Andy.

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:05.480
 Yeah.

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:09.480
 Stamford Bridge, Goodison Park, St James's Park, Emirates Stadium,

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:12.480
 Anfield, Old Trafford, Wembley.

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:16.480
 What is the surface they play football on in those places?

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:17.480
 Grass.

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:19.480
 It is not grass.

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:20.480
 Oh, come on.

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:25.480
 They play on something called Deso Grassmaster.

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:28.480
 Wasn't he one of the pioneers of hip-hop?

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:33.480
 Grassmaster Deso, yeah.

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:41.480
 So it's 95% grass, but 5% uniquely engineered soft polyethylene yarn.

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:42.480
 What?

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:43.480
 So it's mostly grass.

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:45.480
 Well, I didn't say that to be fair.

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:46.480
 It's not grass.

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:47.480
 It's my fault.

00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:49.480
 You wouldn't accept that on one of your quizzes, Paul.

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:51.480
 Well, they wouldn't accept that on the final chase,

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:54.480
 where even the slightest error is punished.

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:56.480
 But they're technically hybrid pitchers.

00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:58.480
 Because it's got tiny bits of plastic in it,

00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:00.480
 and it just helps the grass stay alive,

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:04.480
 and also makes it more bouncy, and it's always perfect.

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:07.480
 Leicester City Football Club, they're very good, aren't they?

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:08.480
 Are they still very good?

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:10.480
 Not as good as they once were.

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:13.480
 No, not as good as they literally once were.

00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:14.480
 Right, because they were...

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:16.480
 But they got promoted last season.

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:17.480
 They did, didn't they?

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:18.480
 They're back in the Premier League.

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:22.480
 Well, in sports turf, science fields.

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:23.480
 The most important fields.

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:24.480
 They're out in front.

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.480
 Are you Micah Richards?

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:27.480
 No, what's that?

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:28.480
 Who's that?

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:30.480
 He's a pundit supery.

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:32.480
 Yeah, former footballer now pundit.

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:33.480
 Oh, great.

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:35.480
 You sound exactly like him.

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:37.480
 OK.

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:41.480
 So Leicester City, they do a lot of the science behind it,

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:43.480
 and they were doing a study in 2021

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:46.480
 for the European Space Agency.

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:47.480
 Oh, yeah.

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:50.480
 About turning their grass clippings into...

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:52.480
 Because if you pile up the clippings,

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:54.480
 it creates a lot of methane gas,

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:56.480
 because it's anaerobic digestion.

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:59.480
 Well, now you are sounding like Micah Richards.

00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:01.480
 Yeah, you're like for like.

00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:03.480
 I don't know what's happening.

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:06.480
 But then that gas, you could turn it into a liquid

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:08.480
 and then refine that into fuel.

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:10.480
 They also know they have 89 nutes,

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:12.480
 and they have to count them.

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:13.480
 What?

00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:14.480
 Because they have to protect their nutes,

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:15.480
 because there are all these rules about,

00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:18.480
 you know, habitat and biodiversity and all this.

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:19.480
 And if you've got 89 nutes...

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:20.480
 89!

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:21.480
 What?

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:24.480
 I could have sworn it was a 19-minute game.

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:27.480
 Oh, my God!

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:30.480
 That just happened.

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.480
 That's the joke of the podcast.

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:33.480
 Like, we've done 500 episodes.

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:35.480
 That's it. That's the joke.

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:36.480
 That's the end.

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:37.480
 Come on, you said it out with 89.

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:39.480
 Must have done.

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:41.480
 Have you heard of Heini Alemania?

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:42.480
 Wish I had.

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:46.480
 He invented the ironically named Fair Play Spray.

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:49.480
 So, Fair Play Spray.

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:51.480
 Do you know what Fair Play Spray is?

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:52.480
 Andy, could you guess?

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:53.480
 You spray it in the other player's eyes.

00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:54.480
 They can't see.

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:55.480
 He's got a goal.

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:56.480
 Is that it?

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:57.480
 No, Paul.

00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:58.480
 Do you know what Fair Play Spray is?

00:36:58.480 --> 00:36:59.480
 No, I have no idea.

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:02.480
 Think of what sprays you use in football every game.

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:03.480
 Deodorant?

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:04.480
 The line.

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:05.480
 The line.

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:06.480
 Yeah, yeah.

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:07.480
 So, the line...

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:09.480
 Basically, when you take a free kick,

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:11.480
 the opposition have to be 10 yards away.

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:13.480
 They usually make a little wall to stop you

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:14.480
 from getting it in the goal.

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:15.480
 I've seen that.

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:16.480
 To make them stand there,

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:18.480
 you'll put a little line of what looks like

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:21.480
 a shaving foam on the ground.

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:24.480
 And this was invented by a guy called Heine Alemania

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:26.480
 in 2000.

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:29.480
 And the reason it's ironically called Fair Play Spray

00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:33.480
 is that FIFA refused to give him any money for it.

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:35.480
 They said basically, you know,

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:38.480
 someone else also came up with an idea around the same time

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:40.480
 and we're just going to do it anyway

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:41.480
 and there's nothing you can do.

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:43.480
 And he went to a Brazilian court

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:45.480
 who found in his favour in 2018

00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:47.480
 that they ordered FIFA to pay 10,000 pounds

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:50.480
 for every game they ignored their order.

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:52.480
 And since then, they probably owe him

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:54.480
 about 200 million quid.

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:55.480
 Wow!

00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:56.480
 What are they paying?

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:59.480
 Well, the ruling was upheld in 2021.

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:03.480
 FIFA said that they are not bound by Brazilian law.

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:05.480
 And as time of recording,

00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:07.480
 I couldn't find out what had happened with it.

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:08.480
 Wow.

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:11.480
 But I know that he does sell them now,

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:13.480
 but he doesn't get paid every time they use them,

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:14.480
 I don't think.

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:16.480
 I trust FIFA as an honest and principle institution

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:18.480
 who will reimburse this guy.

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:19.480
 Yeah, yeah.

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:21.480
 He called it "spoomy" stuff.

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:23.480
 FIFA calls it Fair Play Spray.

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:24.480
 So, "spoomy".

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:30.480
 Can you think of a good nickname for a groundskeeper?

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:31.480
 Willie.

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:32.480
 Yeah.

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:33.480
 Back to the Simpsons.

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:35.480
 So, this is the sort of Uber Willie of...

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:37.480
 You might have heard of him, James,

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:38.480
 because he's called George Tomer.

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:39.480
 No, I don't know.

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:40.480
 And it's American football.

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:41.480
 I'm into American football,

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:43.480
 but not so much that I know the names

00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:44.480
 of all the grounds people.

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:46.480
 And are you really into it at all, you know?

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:48.480
 He did the pitch for every single Super Bowl

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:49.480
 until the 57th one.

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:51.480
 Oh, really?

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:55.480
 He spent 82 years of his life being a groundskeeper.

00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:57.480
 He probably did other things.

00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:59.480
 No, I don't think he did.

00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:00.480
 He started very, very young,

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:02.480
 and he retired last year at 94.

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:04.480
 How interesting, because they move the Super Bowl

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:06.480
 to different places every year, don't they?

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:07.480
 So, okay.

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:08.480
 That must be interesting that he just...

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:09.480
 Yeah, yeah.

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:11.480
 Was it good, or was it a bit like,

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:13.480
 "You know, when he talked to younger doctors,

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:15.480
 "and they say the old ones are sort of sticking

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:17.480
 "with the old ways, don't work as well.

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:18.480
 "They're losing it a bit."

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:21.480
 It'd be a bit of a twist if he was absolutely shit.

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:23.480
 He was incredibly...

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:26.480
 He moaned it to nothing.

00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:29.480
 He moaned about half the pitch one year.

00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:32.480
 He moaned hills everywhere.

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:34.480
 Oh, that's so funny.

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:36.480
 And he said when he retired,

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:38.480
 "When I'm in heaven, I'll be looking at your beautiful field,

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:39.480
 "or I'll be in hell,

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:41.480
 "looking at what kind of root system you have."

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:45.480
 What a great question.

00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:47.480
 And his nickname is The Sodfather.

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:49.480
 Oh, The Sodfather.

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:51.480
 Do you know what's better about grass

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:53.480
 compared to trees if you're lovers?

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:56.480
 It's hard to have sex while lying on a tree.

00:39:56.480 --> 00:40:01.480
 You lack ambition.

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:05.480
 What's better?

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:07.480
 There are an infinite number of correct answers.

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:08.480
 I wish I hadn't gone here.

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:09.480
 You're lovers.

00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:11.480
 I'm looking for a much more innocent, for lovers,

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:12.480
 more innocent variety.

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:15.480
 Bark stains don't show up in your chinas as much.

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:21.480
 One way to pair a 15-year-old who are not acquainted

00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:23.480
 with the birds and the bees do around a tree.

00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:25.480
 Write initials in it.

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:26.480
 Tying on a ribbon.

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:27.480
 Initials.

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:28.480
 Oh, sorry.

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:30.480
 You can't write your initials in a blade of grass.

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:33.480
 But if you did, it would grow with the blade.

00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:35.480
 You know, there's always that thing which is like,

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:37.480
 "Will your initials in a tree grow with the tree?"

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:39.480
 Oh, so it's like high on the ground.

00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:40.480
 No, they won't.

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:42.480
 Yeah, because the tree grows from the top.

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:44.480
 But grass grows from the bottom.

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:46.480
 So if you write your initials on a blade of grass

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:48.480
 and then come back 50 years later...

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:53.480
 How was that blade of grass that we wrote our initials on?

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:58.480
 The amount of filth that groundskeeper's seen over 57 years,

00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:00.480
 you should write a book.

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:01.480
 OK.

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:09.480
 All right, time for fact number four, and that is James.

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:11.480
 OK, my fact this week is that the hiring

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:15.480
 of the first ever African-American White House secretary

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:18.480
 was announced on an episode of a quiz show.

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:19.480
 Unorthodox.

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:22.480
 Was it an unguessable answer if that was the question?

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:23.480
 They didn't get it right.

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:24.480
 OK.

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:25.480
 They didn't get it right.

00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:28.480
 This was in a show called "What's My Line?"

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:31.480
 which people who are old enough would remember.

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:35.480
 It was like a very posh old American game show.

00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:37.480
 Everyone would be in dinner jackets

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:40.480
 and the ladies would be in gowns with gloves and stuff

00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:42.480
 and the host would bring in a guest

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:46.480
 and you would have to guess what their job was basically

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:48.480
 or what they were famous for, something like that.

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:50.480
 And if they were really famous,

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:52.480
 you would have to wear a blindfold.

00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:53.480
 But if they weren't really famous,

00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:54.480
 you wouldn't have to wear a blindfold

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:57.480
 because you wouldn't get any visual clues.

00:41:57.480 --> 00:42:00.480
 And LBJ became president

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:04.480
 and he decided that times were a change in

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:07.480
 and they were going to get rid of segregation.

00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:09.480
 And he thought, well, the best way to do that

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:11.480
 is to start in the White House.

00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:15.480
 And so he hired this person called Geraldine Whittington

00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:18.480
 and rather than doing a big announcement,

00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:21.480
 he thought, if I announce it on national television,

00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:24.480
 maybe that'll make a bit of a splash.

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:27.480
 So Geraldine came onto What's My Line

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:29.480
 and they had to, these B-list celebrities

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:31.480
 had to guess what her job was

00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:33.480
 and they couldn't because no one would ever guess

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:37.480
 that a black woman would be working in the White House at the time.

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:39.480
 That's very clever.

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:41.480
 I don't think there's such a thing as a B-list celebrity

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:44.480
 on American television in the 1950s and '60s.

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:46.480
 But at dinner when you're being on television,

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:48.480
 you're actually huge.

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:50.480
 That's true. I suppose, yeah.

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:52.480
 They were interestingly eminent, those guesses.

00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:54.480
 I think the guess has changed a bit over the years.

00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:57.480
 So the panel included people like Bennett Surf,

00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:02.480
 who won the case against the censorship of Ulysses in 1983,

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:05.480
 the former governor of New Jersey, Dorothy Kigallant,

00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:07.480
 a newspaper columnist who wrote about links

00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:09.480
 between organised crime and U.S. intelligence.

00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:12.480
 What will these people think when they see one of British...

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:14.480
 An equivalent of a British game show?

00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:16.480
 That's Keith Lemon.

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:21.480
 He was the first person to report on the challenge of disaster in 1986.

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:23.480
 (LAUGHTER)

00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:25.480
 It seems such a contrast.

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:27.480
 It's stunning, a very eminent people.

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:30.480
 The celebrity guess, they got huge, weren't they?

00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:34.480
 They had Walt Disney, Savile Dali, Marlon Brando, Jimmy Stewart,

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:36.480
 Grapplery Marks, Errol Flynn.

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:38.480
 So are these celebrity guesses?

00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:42.480
 Celebrity, what's my line, when the guesses are blindfolded?

00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:44.480
 Obviously, you would know immediately, Dali,

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:47.480
 as soon as you'd seen him, so they were blindfolds for him.

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:49.480
 So the guesses were blindfolds and you were allowed to ask,

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:51.480
 "Do you work in the arts?" And he says, "Yes."

00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:53.480
 And it's, "Yes" and no answers.

00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:55.480
 Dali would be a nightmare, sure.

00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:58.480
 A complete nightmare. Everything they asked him, he said, "Yes."

00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:01.480
 I wrote down the questions, "Are you associated with the arts?"

00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:03.480
 "Yes." "Would you have been seen on television?"

00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:05.480
 "Yes." "Are you a performer?" "Yes."

00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:07.480
 "Are you a leading man?" "Yes."

00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:09.480
 And then the host goes, because I've seen the video of it,

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:12.480
 the host goes, "Okay, I just have to say that,

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:16.480
 even though he might be seen as a leading man in some parts of his life,

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:19.480
 it would be misleading for you to think he was a leading man

00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:22.480
 in the normal definition of the phrase."

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:24.480
 And then they move on. It's so funny.

00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:26.480
 So he wasn't even gone with the win, but he was the leading man

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:28.480
 of the Surrealist Army.

00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:31.480
 Because it's really funny, he says, they go,

00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:33.480
 "Are you a leading man?" He goes, "Yes."

00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:35.480
 The host sort of looks at him and goes,

00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:37.480
 "What the fuck are you doing?" And then the two of them

00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:40.480
 have this little conflap where Dali obviously is, like,

00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:42.480
 explaining why he's such a leading man.

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:45.480
 And the host is just going, "Yeah, yeah, but that's not what they know."

00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:47.480
 - That's unbelievable. - It's really good.

00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:50.480
 It shouldn't get Dali on. If you wanted to go in a straightforward way,

00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:52.480
 - don't get Dali on. - Are you an orange?

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:54.480
 Yes.

00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:56.480
 Why have you melted our cock?

00:44:56.480 --> 00:45:00.480
 Just one more thing on what's my line.

00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:03.480
 Did you guys hear about The Sister Show? I've got a secret.

00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:05.480
 - No. - I'm aware of its existence.

00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:07.480
 It's a really fun, it's a tweak on the format, basically.

00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:09.480
 If someone comes on, they've got a secret,

00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:11.480
 the panel has to guess what the secret is.

00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:14.480
 So here are some of the secrets. These are so good.

00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:16.480
 - I discovered the planet Pluto. - Oh, right.

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:19.480
 - Again, it's very evident. - Was that Clyde Tombow?

00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:21.480
 - Yeah. - Okay.

00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:23.480
 He was telling the truth then.

00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:28.480
 You would have ruined this show. It would have been one minute long.

00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:30.480
 Let's see if you can get this one, then, Paul.

00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:32.480
 My wife's going to have a baby.

00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:35.480
 - What? - That was Tony Curtis

00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:38.480
 - about his wife Janet Lee, and that was Jamie Lee Curtis. - Oh, Jamie Lee Curtis.

00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:42.480
 Oh, so this was a way of celebrities to announce things.

00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:45.480
 Like, "I've got a new movie coming out."

00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:49.480
 Best one, "I've got a book coming out," Paul, for instance.

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:51.480
 The best one ever on this show was,

00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:55.480
 "I am the last witness surviving of Abraham Lincoln's assassination."

00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:56.480
 - Oh. - Cool.

00:45:56.480 --> 00:46:01.480
 - It was a guy called Joe Biden. - It was a guy called Samuel Seymour.

00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:03.480
 - And this was-- - Seymour?

00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:06.480
 - He did Seymour indeed. - Very good.

00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:08.480
 This was 1956, they said.

00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:11.480
 He saw it aged five, and he appeared on the show aged 95.

00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:13.480
 Although, there was some skepticism,

00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:16.480
 because he only told anyone about this when he was 94.

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:22.480
 - It slipped his mind. - It just never came up.

00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:25.480
 - That's so funny. - Wow.

00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:27.480
 - There we go. - Something great show.

00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:29.480
 The British show was quite tragic.

00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:33.480
 - But what's my line? - Yeah, because you talk about B-list celebrities.

00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:35.480
 And, of course, they weren't B-list, because they were absolutely A-list

00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:39.480
 on account of being on television at a time when everybody was watching the same thing.

00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:41.480
 So, these people were launched into fame,

00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:43.480
 and there was a guy called Gilbert Hardin,

00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:48.480
 who became known as the rudest man in Britain because of how grumpy he was on the show.

00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:53.480
 He just carried it as an albatross around his neck that he was hated by the British public.

00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:55.480
 And then there's a woman called Lady Isabel Barnett,

00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:57.480
 another one of the regulars on the show,

00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:02.480
 and she committed suicide two days after a shoplifting scandal.

00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:04.480
 - Wow. - Because she couldn't live with the disgrace

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:07.480
 of Lady Isabel Barnett from What's My Line.

00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:10.480
 - Really? - She turned out to be shoplifting for years.

00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:16.480
 And it's the danger of imposing that much fame on people that weren't ready for it.

00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:20.480
 It was a very real keynote way that TV worked in the '50s and '60s.

00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:21.480
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:24.480
 And I'm glad that we only get two and a half million viewers anymore.

00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:28.480
 - What do you say? - That guy appearing on a quiz show has changed, eh?

00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:30.480
 Is it a quiz show or is it a game show? What's my line?

00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:34.480
 Oh, my God, Andy. You are opening up a can of worms here.

00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:36.480
 It's incredibly straightforward, isn't it?

00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:39.480
 If you ask quiz questions that require some knowledge, it's a quiz show.

00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:41.480
 It's not a quiz question, to be honest. What's my line?

00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:44.480
 - I think it's a hybrid because you have to be knowledgeable

00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:47.480
 to solve the puzzles that you're set. - Yeah.

00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:48.480
 It's a wisdom show.

00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:51.480
 Not a quiz show is What's the Capital of Armenia. Paul?

00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:52.480
 - Yerevan. - Yerevan.

00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:54.480
 Oh, James got that one. Sorry.

00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:56.480
 I forgot I was a cold ball there for a second.

00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:59.480
 What's six times nine? 54. I need that one.

00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:02.480
 Sometimes you've got to get in first.

00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:05.480
 You would be the worst quiz show host ever, Andy.

00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:07.480
 And now this is for the million pounds.

00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:10.480
 And the answer is Eleanor of Acquitaine.

00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:11.480
 Let's play.

00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:16.480
 I think if you go onto online forums of people who like quizzes

00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:19.480
 or people who like game shows and you ask this question,

00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:22.480
 for instance, is Countdown a quiz show?

00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:24.480
 - That's the rest of your wheat gum. - Oh, really?

00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:25.480
 I think Countdown is a game show.

00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:27.480
 And the reason I think Countdown is a game show

00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:29.480
 is you don't have to know what any of the words mean.

00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:31.480
 - You just have to know they exist. - That's true.

00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:34.480
 I think it's a quiz show because I think a game show

00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:35.480
 has to have gunge.

00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:40.480
 If there's no gunge, it's quiz.

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:42.480
 - Yeah. - You know?

00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:44.480
 Gladiators is technically a quiz.

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:49.480
 - Does Gladiators have gunge? - No, no, it's quiz.

00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:51.480
 But does that mean any TV show?

00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:54.480
 I mean, I'm a quiz.

00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:55.480
 I mean, I will stress.

00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:58.480
 I don't think there's anything better about either former

00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:00.480
 than both as entertaining as each other.

00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:02.480
 You must know loads and loads and loads of formats

00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:04.480
 for these shows, Paul.

00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:06.480
 - I've watched a lot of-- - You've watched so many.

00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:07.480
 Yeah.

00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:10.480
 So this is a slight game where I don't know

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:12.480
 if you'll just know the answers automatically.

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:15.480
 Like, I'm going to name a title of a quiz show.

00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:17.480
 - Okay. - And if you can guess the format.

00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:19.480
 - Right? - That sounds fun.

00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:21.480
 - Is this a quiz? - Well, no,

00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:23.480
 because I've got some gunge in the ceiling.

00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:27.480
 - Repo games. - Okay.

00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:29.480
 I can't answer this because I know this one.

00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:31.480
 I don't know what this means.

00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:34.480
 I think it's the only quiz show I know the format--

00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:37.480
 or game show I know the format for because I read about it.

00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:38.480
 Oh, okay. Right, Paul.

00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:40.480
 So the others who know about it because they read about it.

00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:42.480
 It's quite difficult because we wouldn't have--

00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:44.480
 Do you have to come up with the first words

00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:47.480
 of Emilio Estevez's films in the 1980s?

00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:50.480
 Yes. Yes, that's it.

00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:53.480
 No, it's that a couple of guys arrive and repossess your car

00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:55.480
 unless you can answer a set of trivia questions

00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:57.480
 in which case you get to keep it.

00:49:57.480 --> 00:50:00.480
 It's like two events in my life combined into one.

00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:03.480
 Both about circa 1998.

00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:05.480
 But I think in this case,

00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:07.480
 they were always going to have their car repossessed

00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:09.480
 because they hadn't had their payment.

00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:10.480
 They haven't done their payments,

00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:12.480
 so they were going to get it repossessed anyway,

00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:14.480
 and they're like, well, here's a chance to save your car, right?

00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:16.480
 Yeah, it's you falling behind on your payments.

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:18.480
 But the reason I read about it is because

00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:19.480
 didn't someone get shot?

00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:22.480
 - Yeah. - I think that's the story about that.

00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:24.480
 But weirdly, you'd think that the people doing the shooting,

00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:26.480
 and they were done for attempted murder,

00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:28.480
 and the people who were having their car repossessed,

00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:29.480
 but they were happy about it.

00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:31.480
 It was the neighbour who was pissed off at the camera

00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:33.480
 and the parked in the driver. Yeah, exactly.

00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:35.480
 I get those cameras out of my face.

00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:37.480
 That's funny. You're in the picture.

00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:39.480
 - OK, I don't know this one. - It's about weeing.

00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:41.480
 You're weeing on a camera.

00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:43.480
 - You're in the picture. - Oh, you're in.

00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:44.480
 You're in the picture.

00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:47.480
 How many photographs can you wee on in a minute?

00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:49.480
 Is it, like, where's Wally?

00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:52.480
 But you're in the picture, so it's where's you.

00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:54.480
 - That is good. - That's very good.

00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:56.480
 There's painting, and the main person's been replaced by you,

00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:58.480
 and you've got to guess the name of the original painting.

00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:00.480
 - Oh, that's a good one. - I think you're almost closest, Paul.

00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:02.480
 It's celebrities.

00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:04.480
 They insert their faces into holes cut out

00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:06.480
 like those things you get at the seaside.

00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:07.480
 - Oh, yeah. - Oh, OK.

00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:09.480
 And you have to guess the image you're in

00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:10.480
 based on you-can-ask-questions.

00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:12.480
 - Oh, I see. - Oh, nice.

00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:14.480
 - I think that's a good game. - Yeah, that's nice.

00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:16.480
 - You know, it lasted one week. - Oh.

00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:18.480
 There was an apology the next week saying that was awful.

00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:20.480
 Sorry.

00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:23.480
 Can I do one? Animal crack-ups.

00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:24.480
 Do you know this one?

00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:25.480
 Animal crack-ups.

00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:27.480
 OK, there is a thing called Animal Crackers.

00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:29.480
 So it's a Jigsaw show,

00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:31.480
 and you have to fit back together pulverized biscuits.

00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:34.480
 - Is that it? - No.

00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:38.480
 Basically, they show lots of videos of animals doing funny things,

00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:41.480
 and then they ask you questions about those animals,

00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:44.480
 and then if you win, you get a stuffed animal.

00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:46.480
 But I only really bring it up because it was hosted

00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:49.480
 by a friend of the podcast, Alan Thickey.

00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:52.480
 - Who is the Thickey bit? - Robin Thickey.

00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:54.480
 - Robin Thickey. - Robin Thickey.

00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:56.480
 - His father was like a big team. - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:59.480
 You also wrote the theme tune to different strokes.

00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:01.480
 That's exactly right.

00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:04.480
 - And also he-- - One of my all-time favorite facts.

00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:07.480
 He also sang the theme to Animal Crack-ups.

00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:09.480
 Wow.

00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:11.480
 You've been on Just A Minute, Paul, right?

00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:12.480
 Yeah.

00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:15.480
 You might have been good in 1928 America

00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:18.480
 where there was a non-stop talking competition.

00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:21.480
 Only if I was good at Just A Minute.

00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:24.480
 - That's the only way that works. - You're not good at it.

00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:27.480
 - It's just impossible. - Is it?

00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:30.480
 Well, this one took four days.

00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:32.480
 And after four days, there were still two people left,

00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:34.480
 and they just split the prize between them.

00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:37.480
 And they hadn't hesitated, deviated, or the other thing?

00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:40.480
 Actually, they did repeat, which is the other thing,

00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:42.480
 because repetition was allowed.

00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:45.480
 One person repeatedly recited Lady Macbeth's speech

00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:47.480
 until they passed out.

00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:49.480
 It wasn't Gels Brandith, was it?

00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:54.480
 There was a person who said something so offensive

00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:57.480
 that the person who ran the competition called the police

00:52:57.480 --> 00:52:59.480
 and they had them arrested.

00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:02.480
 In 1928, that's probably pretty offensive.

00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:05.480
 And the winners were given to the last two people.

00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:07.480
 One of them was a swimming instructor

00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:09.480
 who ran her own dance marathons.

00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:12.480
 And the other one was a man who previously made his name

00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:15.480
 winning flagpole sitting competitions.

00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:18.480
 - Amazing. - That's so good.

00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:21.480
 Have you ever seen "What's My Line"

00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:23.480
 with the intruder who comes on?

00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:25.480
 I haven't seen it, but I read about it.

00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:27.480
 It's so surreal.

00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:30.480
 So it was filmed live until the '60s,

00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:32.480
 which I think was quite late for shows to be filmed live,

00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:33.480
 so anything could happen.

00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:36.480
 It's 1962, and the panel's blindfolded, as we've explained,

00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:39.480
 and the celebrity guest comes on, it's this Greek actress.

00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:41.480
 And as they're asking her stuff,

00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:45.480
 this man appears in a suit, a very well-dressed man,

00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:47.480
 and he just walks on very calmly, and he says,

00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:50.480
 "I'm the second mystery guest. Guess who I am?"

00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:53.480
 And then he starts talking about a dating service that he runs.

00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:55.480
 And the host, what's he called?

00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:57.480
 - John Charles Dailey. - Dailey.

00:53:57.480 --> 00:53:59.480
 It's great, apparently, obviously he had a code for it,

00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:01.480
 because he just says into the microphone,

00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:03.480
 "We have a small problem.

00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:06.480
 Gil, will you get the relieving unit in, please?"

00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:08.480
 They winked him off.

00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:11.480
 And he said, "That's all I wanted."

00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:12.480
 And then he left the stage.

00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:14.480
 That was the grand prize this week.

00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:16.480
 It was always going to be that.

00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:18.480
 - Sorry, I had to blindfold you. - Wow.

00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:20.480
 And then he said, "Schedule two,"

00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:23.480
 which makes me really want to know what schedule one and three were.

00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:25.480
 And then you see men hurry past the camera.

00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:27.480
 But the interesting thing was, this guy was identified

00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:29.480
 as someone called Ronald Melstein,

00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:31.480
 who had a dating company he's trying to promote

00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:33.480
 in this unusual way, apparently.

00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:36.480
 And he disappeared, and then years later, this was in '62,

00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:41.480
 and then in 1987, there's this really dramatic police chase,

00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:44.480
 and one of the police cars runs into a tree

00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:46.480
 next to the taken to hospital.

00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:48.480
 Another police car slips on an oil slick.

00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:50.480
 They catch up with the guy there chasing,

00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:53.480
 who's running a prostitution ring, and it is Ronald Melstein.

00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:56.480
 Oh, at least they found out what his line was.

00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:58.480
 May have taken 25 years.

00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:01.480
 The greatest contestant we ever had.

00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:09.480
 Okay, that's it. That is everyone's facts.

00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:11.480
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:13.480

 Paul, is there anywhere people can get in touch with you?

00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:23.480
 Yes, on Amazon, on an advert for the book,

00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:25.480
 One Sinner Lifetime.

00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:27.480

00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:29.480
 And you'll reply to every individual person

00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:31.480
 who gets in touch on Amazon by buying your book.

00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:33.480
 Absolutely, every single one.

00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:34.480
 Great.

00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:36.480

00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:38.480

 We are kicking off within the next few weeks, in fact.

00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:56.480
 So get there, get your tickets now.

00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:58.480
