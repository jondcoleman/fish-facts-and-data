00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,120
 Hello and welcome back to another Drop As A Line. This is the bonus bit of fish

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,400
 where we talk about your correspondence, the facts,

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,760
 corrections, telling-offs, and lucrative commercial offers that you've all been

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,600
 sending in to the QI inbox, specifically the podcast inbox. If you

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,480
 would like to contact us, all you have to do is write to podcast@qi.com

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,000
 and it will be lovingly read and curated and if you have extra information

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,360
 about the show then we'd love to hear it. So first up would you like

9
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:49,440
 bonus information about Roger Bannister or about an octopus in a toilet?

10
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,200
 I want Bannister personally. Okay, this is from Rihanna Fowler. Rihanna says

11
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,240
 just wanted to email in after listening to the latest episode

12
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,320
 as I may have a small piece of intel on the Roger Bannister biscuit conspiracy.

13
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,240
 Oh, what was that? What was that? If you remember it was an interview who asked him

14
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,920
 "What's your favorite biscuit?" and he said "No, no, no, I'm not telling you."

15
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,520
 That's a silly question. I'm not talking- and he kept asking you know

16
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,040
 and Bannister eventually just ended the interview. Okay, Rihanna says

17
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,960
 "My grandma worked briefly with Roger Bannister when she was training to be a

18
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,200
 nurse in London back in the 50s and has always told us

19
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,240
 that he'd come into the ward kitchen late at night to pinch a cup of hot cocoa

20
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,480
 and some biscuits." Wait a minute. When this interviewer came in Bannister

21
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:40,160
 thought "I've been rumbled. I'm not answering any questions about that."

22
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,320
 Rihanna says "A bold choice of snack for someone quotes 'not into

23
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,840
 biscuits'." I actually think it is the Lady Death

24
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,320
 protest too much with this because I just remembered, I don't think I mentioned

25
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,560
 this, my brother worked on his autobiography

26
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,480
 and he said whenever he went to Roger Bannister's house

27
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,760
 his wife would bring in a tray of tea and biscuits. Okay,

28
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:06,240
 very nice. I was just thinking that it's a bit of a shame because Roger Bannister

29
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,160
 he's really well known as a runner right but he always wanted to be well known

30
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,720
 as a surgeon and was quite annoyed that people

31
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,320
 knew him as a runner and now everyone's just talking about the biscuits.

32
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,600
 So now he's most well known as someone who doesn't like biscuits or maybe

33
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,480
 does like biscuits. Second most well known as the first

34
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,600
 Bannister runner four-minute mile and third best well known for his medical

35
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,720
 stuff. You never know what you're going to be

36
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,720
 remembered for do you? No, it's true. It sounds to me like you

37
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,160
 love biscuits so much you couldn't choose. Like if someone asked your favorite child

38
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,200
 you would be quite annoyed if they kept on persisting. You'd be like "I don't want

39
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,920
 to answer that question." I don't know. I think my parents can

40
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,520
 an answer will occur to you before you say "I don't have a favorite child, I'm sure."

41
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,560
 I guess so. Yeah, you're just going to make sure it doesn't come out of your mouth.

42
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,480
 Exactly, yeah. Okay, great. Thank you very much Rhianna.

43
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,400
 Any more info on Bannister's Biscuits. Please.

44
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,440
 Podcast.qi.com. Here's something from Emily Hall.

45
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,400
 "Hello Anna or whoever else monitors this mailbox."

46
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,080
 Hi Emily. Thanks Emily in advance.

47
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,400
 Some of us put in lots of you know reading it. Anyway Emily says

48
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,400
 "I noticed a few interesting parts of the Wikipedia articles about each of you

49
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,600
 and thought you'd be interested to hear about them."

50
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,920
 So she's quoting directly here. "James Harkins.

51
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,320
 Use of puns has been reviewed positively." Oh yeah, that's it.

52
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:35,200
 It doesn't say that's the thing. "Dan Treiber is proficient in Mandarin."

53
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,480
 And Emily adds "I don't dispute this but Dan did mention that he forgot his name

54
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,000
 in Mandarin when he went back to school." Yeah, I've got sauce needed for both of

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,040
 these so far. We've been in a restaurant with Dan

56
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,920
 and he spoke Mandarin to the person who ran the restaurant.

57
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,400
 Yeah, that's right. Boston was that, maybe?

58
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,960
 It was in Boston, that's correct. But didn't say his own name though. Didn't say

59
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,920
 his own name. Didn't introduce himself. No, no. They said "What's your name?"

60
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,080
 And he was like "Oh, I don't know." I just repeated back to him what he said.

61
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,960
 But I think part of that you said that part of the discussion was you

62
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,360
 explaining to them that you can't really speak Mandarin very well.

63
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,120
 Yeah, and then they did bring us all the wrong food.

64
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,840
 My Mandarin is terrible now. I've been out of Hong Kong since I was 12 years old.

65
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,400
 But can I just say I forgot my name when I was

66
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,160
 five years old at school or six years old. This was a very long time ago.

67
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,240
 Oh, that's fine. Yeah, yeah. But I'm not proficient at it. That should change.

68
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,320
 That is a citation needed. Okay.

69
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,640
 Can we change it to semi-proficient? Yeah, I'd buy that.

70
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,360
 So James's use of puns have been reviewed positively.

71
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,280
 "Dan Treiber is proficient in Mandarin."

72
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,520
 "Dan-der-in" more like. Wow. Brilliant.

73
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,920
 There's more positive reviews for that, a wiki article off the back of that.

74
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,600
 "Tajinsky has been noted for her dry humour on the podcast."

75
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,960
 Hmm, interesting. So James turns that "Tajinsky has been

76
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,000
 noted for her dry humour on the podcast. And Emily says, "You don't seem like a

77
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,400
 type of people to Google yourselves, so I thought you'd like to learn some of

78
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,120
 the things people have written about you. Thank you for making the podcast."

79
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,480
 Emily. That's it. That's the email. Oh, really?

80
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,800
 Yep. So thanks, Emily.

81
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,840
 She knows you are the type to Google yourself, so

82
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,280
 you've memorized your own Wikipedia page.

83
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,280
 You must be on Wikipedia. Yeah, I am. It's a bit shorter than I'd like.

84
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,560
 Yeah. I didn't know any of us except Dan were on.

85
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,840
 Yeah, we're all on. Oh, there we go.

86
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,840
 Some people's entries are apparently more full of facts than others.

87
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,000
 The main response we've had in the past week, I'd say, has been about the

88
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,040
 Sour Patch Kid medical procedure.

89
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,600
 Dan, you weren't here for this. This was the Steve Mould episode, was it?

90
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,200
 Exactly. Yeah, yeah. So it's a way of dealing with

91
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:49,200
 an anal prolapse. Prolapse rectum. You sprinkle sugar on it

92
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,880
 and the prolapse rectum goes down and then you can just prod it back in.

93
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,040
 Oh, wow. And it's known as the Sour Patch Kid, or sometimes sugaring the rim.

94
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,800
 Yeah. So much. So much correspondence on this.

95
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,920
 Really? Lots of photos.

96
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,560
 Safia Flurry said, "I'd just like to confirm no such thing as assertion that

97
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,400
 anal prolapse can be treated with sugar." I learned this from an Iranian guy who

98
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,360
 reversed his chicken's prolapsed uterine with pomegranate compresses.

99
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,040
 Wow. You're spending a lot on that. I mean, just put some basic sugar on

100
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,720
 forking out with a pomegranate. No, you want to treat your chickens right.

101
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,920
 Sam Kelsel says, "My wife is a vet and confirms that sugar on a prolapse is

102
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,200
 standard practice. They even had to steal the sugar used for the teas and

103
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,040
 coffees in the kitchen once for just that reason."

104
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,640
 Hannah says, "I have a dog that gets too intimate with a cushion to the point

105
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,480
 that he gets too engorged and can't retract his boy bits."

106
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,440
 When this happened, I rang the vet and they told me to put a sugar and water

107
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,480
 mixture on it and it went down. They said they get off that all the time.

108
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,240
 That was an interesting call to make in front of my 10-year-old son.

109
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:58,000
 Wait, so it's a boner killer as well? Yeah, it is. It just makes the blood go down.

110
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 Wow. And I wrote back to Hannah actually and asked for a bit of

111
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,280
 clarification on this. You know, she wrote back, "Dog has not

112
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,640
 learned from his experience. All cushions have had to be removed from the lounge."

113
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,680
 Push it around the cushions. Cover the cushions with honey.

114
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,760
 Great idea. Yeah, very good idea. Look, the main bit of correspondence we've

115
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,800
 had on this is from someone called Arna and I just wanted to tell you, it's

116
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,480
 slightly longer, but hello all. I accidentally misheard something James

117
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,840
 said and as a result, for about 10 minutes, my entire view of the world

118
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,160
 was shaken. I thought I knew what, this is quite rude, this email. So if you're

119
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,360
 listening to this and you're, you know, six years old, maybe just, I mean, you know.

120
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,040
 Don't tell your mum. Yeah, exactly. I thought I knew what a

121
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,080
 prolapse stainless was and so I was mostly unshocked by your

122
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,280
 discussion until I heard James say, "Basically,

123
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,240
 it's when your intestines come out of your rectum."

124
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,680
 Except that I didn't hear the word intestines. I'm American

125
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,760
 and I'm used to hearing that pronounced as "intestines"

126
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,840
 rather than "intestines." Maybe that's what confused me.

127
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,120
 Maybe James said it rather quickly. It doesn't matter.

128
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,160
 What matters is that I thought James said, an anal prolapse was,

129
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,640
 "When your testes come out of your rectum."

130
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,080
 Yeah, I think we all saw the error there. And I trust you guys. I know you're

131
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:22,000
 smart, good at research people. So I believe this.

132
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,320
 For a good seven to ten minutes, I believed I lived in a world

133
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,600
 where you could mess up a butt so badly

134
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,880
 that your testes could get sucked up into your body

135
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:38,480
 and pulled out of your abyss. I don't think anyone has ever been more relieved

136
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:44,160
 by the Google results for how does a prolapse stainless happen?

137
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,840
 I now once again live in the world where part of your intestines might poke out

138
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,880
 of your anus a little bit. But let me tell you, this world we live in

139
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,640
 has one great gift. And that is that your balls can't come out of

140
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,560
 your butt, no matter what you do.

141
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:04,400
 Kind regards, Anna. I think that might be a better world.

142
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,480
 It's like you've got your own space op.

143
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,920
 That's a great question. Anna, thank you so much. I actually got a

144
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:17,120
 vaginal message this week. We get a lot of feedback on the podcast

145
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,880
 that we mentioned penises too much. I couldn't agree more. I can't stop them.

146
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,560
 But I do think we welcome any vaginal antidotes to that.

147
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,800
 But this is where my guy called Mark McConnell, who actually sends so many

148
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,280
 good facts in. And his fact is it was headlined.

149
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,720
 In fact, the subject line was poetical vagina, terracotta army,

150
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,160
 Walter Gastang. We get some really good subject lines

151
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,160
 in our podcast. But it's about a guy called Joe Davis.

152
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,000
 This is the kind of person you would know about Dan.

153
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,920
 He's an artist and scientist who decided that,

154
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,320
 well, he was sad that aliens didn't have any representations of human genitals

155
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,680
 to go on. And so he sent out into space the sound of

156
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:03,280
 vaginal contractions. And he created a special system, I think,

157
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,240
 like a special vagina contracting detection machine,

158
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,400
 and then brought it to a ballet company. He brought it to,

159
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,160
 I think it was the Moscow Ballet. I don't know why they all agreed to do this.

160
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,200
 But he recorded their vaginal contractions and he transmitted them out into space.

161
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,160
 He was working at university at the time. I think someone like Stanford.

162
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,040
 And so they transmitted it into space for about two minutes.

163
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,240
 And then it was shut down by the U.S. Air Force.

164
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,320
 But those sound waves will still be traveling in space, right?

165
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:36,880
 Each big star cluster sounds rude somehow.

166
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,720
 They know what a vaginal contraction sounds like,

167
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,800
 which is actually more than I can say for myself.

168
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,960
 I'm not aware of that sound. I've been to the Bolshevik Ballet

169
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:49,440
 and it was the Nutcracker weirdly enough.

170
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,200
 And to be honest, I heard only the music. I didn't hear any contractions.

171
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,240
 Well, James, this is going to explode your brain.

172
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:02,320
 There were no instruments being played that day.

173
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,240
 Wow. Incredible. That's great.

174
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,600
 Very cool.

175
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,280
 I've got one final fact that was sent in to us.

176
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,360
 I must have sent in by someone called Wyatt Nottingham.

177
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,480
 And it just, well, I'll just read you the fact.

178
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,360
 Do you, this is the whole email, by the way, as well.

179
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,720
 This is the entire email in its entirety that I'm about to read out to you.

180
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,520
 Do you know that in Jasmine, Saskatchewan,

181
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:26,080
 it is illegal for a cow to moo within 300 kilometres of a private home?

182
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,920
 Wyatt Nottingham. So thanks for that.

183
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,320
 I don't know it. And nor do I believe it. Why?

184
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,520
 What? It can't be true.

185
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,080
 What do you mean?

186
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,200
 I don't think it is true.

187
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,160
 No.

188
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,360
 Just giving it an example of some of the absolutely untrue stuff

189
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,960
 that gets sent in to us sometimes.

190
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,600
 That makes sense to me. It's simply a distance thing.

191
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,600
 So it's saying a full cow, but they're just saying,

192
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,600
 if you can hear a moo within that distance.

193
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,400
 Within 300 kilometres.

194
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,440
 300 kilometres. You've got amazing hearing.

195
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,240
 Canada's big.

196
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,080
 You've got farmers who need to live near the cows they're raising.

197
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,800
 Are you saying they have to live more than 300 kilometres from their herd?

198
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,520
 You guys have lived in a big country like I have in Australia.

199
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,240
 You know, things are further away and that's just how it is.

200
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,120
 You get used to it.

201
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,040
 300 kilometres? Yeah, nothing. It's fine.

202
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,320
 Yeah.

203
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,600
 I'm with you. Whatever your name was.

204
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,240
 E-mailer.

205
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,520
 Wyatt Wyatt.

206
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,920
 Okay. Well, Wyatt, if you have any actual evidence, that's true.

207
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,040
 If you've any other facts, please send them my way.

208
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,560
 We need some for the show.

209
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,800
 Send it in to droppersaline, which is podcast@qi.com.

210
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,920
 That's right.

211
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,520
 I can't say I miss Dan's corner.

212
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,040
 I quite like Anna's corner.

213
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,240
 Anna's corner was fun today.

214
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:34,400
 Yeah.

215
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,080
 The corner's been moving around a bit, hasn't it?

216
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:36,880
 We've been doing a corner.

217
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,120
 Well, what are we hearing?

218
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,120
 You were good. You were fun too.

219
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,560
 Well, could you stick that on my Wikipedia page, please?

220
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,440
 I need the support.

221
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,240
 Okay, guys, that's it.

222
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,480
 Thank you so much for your correspondence.

223
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,040
 It's an absolute joy to read.

224
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,600
 And if you have more information about any of the things

225
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,960
 you've heard on Fish or on this episode of droppersaline,

226
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,560
 I mean, maybe we'll bring the prolapse chat to a close

227
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,000
 at some point in the near future.

228
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,440
 But I don't want to promise that either.

229
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,000
 I mean, you know, it might be more info out there about it.

230
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,240
 Either way, send it into podcast@qi.com.

231
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,520
 Thank you very much for listening to this.

232
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,560
 We hope you've enjoyed it.

233
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,920
 We'll see you next time.

234
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,240
 Bye.

235
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,240
 Bye.

236
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,240
 You

237
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,240
 You

238
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,240
 You

239
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,820
 (upbeat music)

240
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,400
 (upbeat music)
