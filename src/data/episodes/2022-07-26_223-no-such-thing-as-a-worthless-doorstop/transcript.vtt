 Hello!

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.080
 And welcome to another episode.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.240
 A no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast,

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.280
 this week coming to you live from Melbourne!

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:31.520
 [cheering and applause]

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.920
 My name is Dan Schreiber, and I am sitting here with Anacizanski,

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.760
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.840
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.880
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.080
 And in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.640
 Starting with you, James.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.000
 OK, my fact this week is that the only known modern death

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.680
 due to meteorite was a cow who was hit in the neck

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.800
 in Venezuela in 1972.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.960
 [audience laughing]

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.840
 We didn't know about it for a decade,

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.520
 because the farmer ate the cow, and used the meteorite

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.280
 as a doorstop.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.320
 [audience laughing]

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.320
 It's amazing.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.840
 Yeah, so this is a thing that happened in Venezuela,

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.960
 in a town that I don't know how to pronounce.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.240
 It's T-R-U-J-I-L-L-O.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.240
 Croyo.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.680
 Was that a Zorro impression?

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.880
 Yeah, it was good.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.080
 So there was a sonic boom one night,

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.720
 and then the next morning, they found the dead cow and the rock.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.360
 They kind of thought nothing more about it,

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.520
 but then 10 years later, a doctor came along,

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.680
 and he checked out this rock and realized that it was a meteorite,

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.000
 and he said, this is definitely a meteorite that's killed the cow.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.760
 And that's the only one, there's a lot of kind of possible people

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.720
 who've been killed or things that have been killed by meteorites,

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.000
 but this is the only one with an actual certificate that says,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.800
 that's what it is, really.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.840
 And did he just look at his doorstop after all those years

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.640
 and go, well, that actually does look a bit like a meteorite?

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.040
 I mean, how does it transpire that someone suddenly decides

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.840
 to take their doorstop to a science museum?

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.200
 I think it was that the doctor was visiting them,

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.000
 rather than them taking just every single bit of rock in the house,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.440
 rather than the museum.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.600
 Is this what? No. Is this what? No.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.480
 You got lucky in the end.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.640
 But then some people are a little bit skeptical about it, actually,

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.320
 because what they realized is because this is now a famous meteorite

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.560
 because it killed a cow.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.640
 It's now worth 10 times more than it was originally.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.640
 So they're thinking maybe there's something going dodgy going on here.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.960
 And then there's another twist.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.280
 So around the same area, actually, in Chile and the Atacama,

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.720
 there was a large meteorite landed there.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.040
 And the load of people collected it.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.600
 And this was a really famous one.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.480
 And it landed in a dry riverbed called Thakamwurta.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.000
 How do you-- sorry, how do you pronounce that?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 Thakamwurta.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.560
 Sorry, yeah.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.600
 [LAUGHTER]

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.080
 Whatever Andy just said means a dead cow in Spanish.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.560
 And so the theory is that maybe these people

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.160
 heard about this famous one.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.840
 And that, they went, that gives me an idea.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.640
 I'm going to pretend my cow got hit by that.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.120
 And then when anyone comes, I'll have the rock.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.240
 But then I can say, oh, no, I ate the cow.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.760
 Right.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:21.280
 I'll check that.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.440
 But don't they-- they do test these rocks, right?

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.280
 Oh, yeah, you can tell if a meteorite is a meteorite.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.400
 So they test his rock.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.600
 I mean, presumably, they did.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.760
 Yeah, so the meteorite is definitely a meteorite.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:31.280
 Yeah, OK.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.480
 But the question is, did it kill the cow or not?

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.280
 Oh, that's what some people are skeptical about.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.360
 Right, OK, I see.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.160
 Have you guys heard of the Nakala meteorite

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.920
 which fell on Egypt in 1911?

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:40.920
 Nope.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.920
 The story is that it vaporized a dog.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.600
 Oh, yes.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.640
 But that is very much the story of it, as in there's no evidence.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.360
 Because obviously the dog was vaporized.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.920
 Just what makes people think it's not quite true.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.680
 Yeah.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.840
 I read a really cool story that people

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.760
 used to think that Venus fly traps were aliens traveling

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.640
 on meteorites that landed on Earth.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.720
 Because back in the day, Venus, what are you on about?

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.080
 No, this is--

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.640
 I read this on the BBC's website.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.160
 Back in the day, Venus fly traps would be very unpredictable

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.280
 and where they came up.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.000
 And they would go to places where they would think

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.160
 a meteorite had landed.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.000
 And very often, they would see out of place Venus fly traps.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.160
 And it looks like an alien.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.440
 And so they thought it's an alien.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.200
 It only looks like an alien because we've

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.680
 designed alien things after it, like movies and stuff like that.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.680
 Yeah.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.160
 Actually, our aliens look like Venus fly traps.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.640
 You're right.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.720
 Is that way around, isn't it?

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.520
 Yeah.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.040
 But they did.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.520
 People used to attribute--

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.200
 sorry, Dan.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.200
 But we're fine with vaporizing dog story over here.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:50.640
 Yeah, that was a very sad story.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.160
 Poor dog.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.520
 They-- people would make money out of meteorites.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.560
 And like so, like you were saying, people would pay

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.320
 to come and see various cows.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.200
 And like, anything that's sort of been touched by a meteorite

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.200
 or experienced a meteorite can then be sold.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.160
 So there was one that smashed through a car in New York

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.200
 in 1992, smashed through the boot of the car, the trunk of the car.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.160
 And the owner of the car had just bought it for $400.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.000
 And she was able to sell it for 25 times that amount straight

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.680
 afterwards.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.480
 And she was also able to sell the original title to the car

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.480
 from when she bought it, and a bulb from the rear tail light

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.080
 that had been blasted out by the meteorite.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.080
 Wow.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.440
 It was worth it.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.720
 I emailed the Secretary of the American Meteorological

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.240
 Society.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.480
 This is a people who look after meteorites.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.160
 And ask them what to do if I find the meteorite.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.960
 And they said the protocol for collecting meteorites,

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.800
 ideally a fresh meteorite should be collected

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.000
 immediately without touching it and placed

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.360
 in a plastic sealed bag.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.600
 How do you do that without touching it?

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.240
 It's the same procedure as for a dog poo.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.760
 Yeah.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.800
 Imagine.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:56.400
 And then you--

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.200
 And if the dog hang it up on a tree and wait

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.200
 for the authorities to come in.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.200
 And you don't have the dog anymore,

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.200
 because it's been vaporized.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.200
 Do you guys know there are about 20 full-time meteorite

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.200
 hunters in the world, very rare career to have.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.440
 And I think it was National Geographic.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.560
 They interviewed one of them.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.840
 He was a guy called Michael Farmer.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.240
 He has been imprisoned for months in Oman,

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.400
 because he went there.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.480
 He knew a meteorite had landed.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.240
 He went to try and find it.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.640
 And they locked him up saying, you're not

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.480
 allowed to take rocks out of Oman.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.520
 But he's been nearly killed.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.040
 But the one thing he said in this interview, which

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.320
 I really liked was he said, I've eaten a small piece

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.960
 of every moon rock and mars rock that I have purchased or found.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.960
 Not many people can say they have eaten a piece of the moon.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.880
 And then he said, and I know for a fact

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.040
 that numerous scientists have done the same.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.560
 Do you think they're checking to see if it tastes of cheese?

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:56.440
 But I think you would do that when you give it a lick, at least.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.800
 Yes, I would want to see what it tasted like.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.800
 But I wouldn't eat a small bit of the moon.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.640
 It feels somehow disrespectful.

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:04.720
 To whom?

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.880
 The goddess Salini.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.640
 Oh, but yeah.

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:11.760
 Actually, that's what you do, isn't it, with fossils and stuff, isn't it?

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.920
 If you're not sure-- if you've got fossilized dinosaur poo, for instance,

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:20.160
 you can lick it, and it'll be slightly tacky to your tongue.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:20.760
 Really?

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:21.800
 Come on.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.520
 It's a long time since he's been in a dinosaur, OK?

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.360
 If you find a plastic bag hanging up on a tree,

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.320
 and you're not sure if it's a meteorite, do not do that.

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:34.400
 Well, that's like a farmer's eat their soil, don't they?

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:39.240
 Sometimes, some farmers test their-- taste their soil to see if it's fertile.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:43.440
 And then the other way is by sitting down with your bare bottom on the soil.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.280
 Yes.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.080
 What's that for?

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.680
 If it's just for show.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.640
 It's like to check if it's warm enough.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:52.160
 Yeah.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:57.400
 So the soil's warm enough if you drop your trousers, sit on it, and it's just not sort of sore.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.680
 Does anyone do that?

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:00.200
 No.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.600
 So it's not a common practice these days, but--

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:06.240
 Although I keep her a pair of underpants buried in my back garden.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.960
 We all do that.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.960
 Why did you do that?

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:12.320
 This was official advice from someone or other.

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.080
 Not to me.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.600
 Life took farmers.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.920
 And the idea is you put your underpants in your back garden,

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:21.120
 and then you go back a few months later, and you check if they've been eaten away

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.000
 by all the microbes and stuff.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.360
 And you'll always know because the microbes can't eat the elastic band

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:30.080
 around the side of it, but they can eat the cotton.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.840
 And the purpose to see how--

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:36.120
 I mean, no, like if the bacteria have eaten them, then what?

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.080
 Then you've got good soil, and you can plant stuff.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.480
 And if they haven't, then you have to put some fertilizer in.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.480
 Also, you've got a free thong at that point.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:53.760
 So I was reading-- you know, in movies, how there's always a sci-fi movie

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:57.240
 that will start in Antarctica, and a meteorite has landed.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.840
 And Antarctica always seems to be associated

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.240
 with finding big meteorites.

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.680
 And I thought I was like, is that because of the poles

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.440
 and it attracts as the meteorites coming in?

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.360
 And then I read this article.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.320
 It turns out the reason they go there

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.560
 is because they're much easier to find because everything's white.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.920
 So they just stick out.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:18.720
 Is that amazing?

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.240
 I thought there was some deep, amazing alien life kind of thing.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.720
 No, it's just like, oh, there it is.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.760
 It's so much easier.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:28.440
 So much more simple than trekking through a forest full of rocks.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:29.200
 That's true.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.480
 Also, not many humans there and other people to disturb it, right?

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.280
 Yeah.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.320
 Because they're black, aren't they, meteorites?

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.840
 That's the sort of lessons on how to spot them.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.600
 And so another place where it's really common for meteorites

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:41.960
 to be found is Morocco.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.440
 So for a country of its size, it's

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:48.720
 got like by multiple factors of 10 more meteorite findings

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.840
 than any other country of its size in the world.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.480
 And this is just because this guy in 2006

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:56.400
 decided to start teaching people how to spot a meteorite.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.680
 And it's become a proper career for a lot

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.120
 of the nomadic people in Morocco.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.960
 They go around finding meteorites.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.840
 So a lot of them make money out of this.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:06.680
 And it's actually where the most important meteorite

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.680
 probably ever found was found.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.080
 It was one that came from Mars.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.560
 It was in 2011.

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.240
 And it's like this whole jumble of rocks

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.080
 that were thrown together.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.920
 And also, it's kind of full of old Mars water.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:20.360
 So it's the first kind of evidence that we have of that.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.440
 But the cool story about this is that it

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.680
 was found by this guy who'd had lessons

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.680
 that they have in Morocco on how to spot a meteorite.

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:27.720
 And he saw it.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.520
 I think it was on sale in a market.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:32.520
 It's called the Black Beauty Stone now.

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:33.920
 But it was on sale in a market.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:34.520
 And he looked at it.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:35.760
 He was tempted.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.600
 And then he said, no, no, I'm not going to buy it.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:38.560
 He drove away.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:39.600
 He changed his mind.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.720
 He drove back.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.000
 And then he bought it.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.120
 And he was driving.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.720
 He was on his way back from the hospital

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.160
 from having a gall stone removed.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.000
 So he had one stone removed.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.320
 And then he immediately got another stone.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.720
 Yeah.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:56.120
 You're saying this in the way that Dan says things sometimes.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:00.160
 I thought it sounded like that.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.240
 Is that what I sound like?

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:06.520
 I am so sorry.

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:07.800
 Hey, we need to move on shortly.

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.440
 You guys got anything before we do?

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.200
 Can I give you a list of other things

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.240
 that have been used as door stops over the years?

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.080
 Yeah, sure.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.720
 It is unbelievable how careless people are.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.600
 So it's just like everything valuable you've ever heard of.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.360
 In 2016, a Chinese vase being used as a door stop

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:27.560
 was suddenly sold for $860,000.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:31.600
 In 2014, a Chinese pot sold for $150,000.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.120
 A min vase in 2012 sold for a million.

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:40.200
 The world's largest sapphire in 1947 was found in Queensland.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.240
 It been used as a door stop for nine years

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.320
 until the owner looked a bit closer.

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:48.280
 A Bronze Age dagger that was worth $50,000.

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:52.040
 In 1802, a lump of gold had been used as a door stop

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.920
 for three years until a jeweler who was visiting this house

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:55.720
 saw it.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:58.240
 And it sparked America's very first gold rush

00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:59.960
 so in North Carolina.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:03.640
 And finally, a can of tinned veal that

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:06.640
 was left in the Arctic by William Perry, the explorer.

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:11.080
 In 1825, it was rediscovered by another explorer in 1829

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.760
 and used as a door stop for many, many years.

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:17.440
 And finally opened in 1958.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.040
 Yeah, it got that reaction, I think,

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:22.280
 from the people who opened it as well.

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.480
 OK, it is time for fact number two.

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:25.880
 And that is my fact.

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:29.600
 My fact this week is that there is a unique species of ant

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.800
 that only lives in 10 blocks of New York City.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.560
 They call it the Manhattan.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:45.400
 This was sent in to me, actually, by a guy called Justin Hintz.

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:49.400
 And it was that this biologist discovered this species of ant,

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:53.440
 which lives between 63rd Street and 76th Street in New York,

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:56.680
 which is in Broadway in Broadway, Manhattan.

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.880
 And yeah, and they were looking at it.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:01.680
 And they noticed that it was unlike any of the 13,000

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.680
 other species of ants that have ever been cataloged.

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.080
 They thought it might have come from Europe,

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:07.600
 but they can't trace it to any known ant.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:11.440
 So that is, they've got this one city dwelling

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:14.080
 that has evolved to be its own species.

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.080
 And Manhattan.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.880
 How do you look at an ant?

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.480
 And then immediately access your mental catalog

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:24.200
 of all the 13,000 other ants and just eliminate them all.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:27.080
 Unless it has something extremely different.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.760
 Like, it had an extra leg.

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:32.000
 It was driving one of the yellow cabs, that's what that wasn't so.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.760
 Get out of here.

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.840
 So they eat so much junk food.

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:39.640
 And the scientists who were studying this

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.280
 said that the pavement ant eats so much,

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.320
 shifting their diets to more human foods

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.880
 that it's actually changing the chemical makeup

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:50.880
 of their bodies to look more like humans.

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:55.560
 Which, sadly, is not as exciting a sentence as I thought it was.

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.880
 I think they mean internally, as opposed to, like, got a face.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:04.600
 I've also got faces, surely.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:09.520
 Ah, but just imagine, like, my face on an ant.

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:12.680
 Yeah, so yeah, and they don't get diabetes, though.

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:15.680
 So that's a thing that separates the ants.

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:18.080
 So other ants get diabetes, do they?

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:18.880
 No.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.880
 What?

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:21.480
 Sorry.

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:22.340
 I say--

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:24.360
 Compared to the humans who are reading all the fast food,

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:25.440
 I think it was your point, right?

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:26.040
 Yes, yeah.

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.280
 They're very good at digesting it.

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:29.320
 The fast food is actually sort of made for ants, it turns out.

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:30.000
 Exactly.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:30.480
 Got it.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:31.280
 Not for us.

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:33.520
 The coming human ants don't get diabetes

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:34.800
 so they can keep eating.

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:37.320
 The scientist who did that, he was called Clint Peneck.

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.480
 And he was talking about the study.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:39.600
 He was interviewed about it.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:43.600
 And he said, when he was doing the study, nobody ever talked to me.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.000
 I basically was walking around and then

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.520
 crouching down on the ground and huffing something off the sidewalk

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.280
 through this ridiculous-looking device.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:52.760
 And not a single New Yorker was like, hey, what are you doing?

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:55.320
 I guess I was not the weirdest person on the street.

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:58.200
 Now, that suggests to me that he was the weirdest person

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.760
 on the street.

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:03.640
 You don't tend to talk to the weirdest person on the street, mate.

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.200
 That's not what everyone does.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.560
 So New York has a few other species, doesn't it?

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:08.560
 That's so unique to it.

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.200
 They have a unique centipede.

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.680
 They have a sweet bee.

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:14.640
 They have a white-footed mouse with small ears.

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:18.920
 They also found in New York in 2014 the first new amphibian

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:21.800
 that's been found in the state for 150 years.

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.800
 So a frog, a leopard frog.

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.720
 And so for more than a century, there's

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.040
 been two types of leopard frog living in New York

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.680
 and people have been arguing over it.

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.480
 Scientists have been arguing because there

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:35.800
 seemed to be so much variety in the different leopard frogs.

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.320
 There was this big debate that went on.

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:40.040
 And apparently, lots of discord and backlash

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.280
 from one scientist to another about theories

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:44.240
 as to how come there was so much variation

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.400
 with these two species.

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:49.040
 And a hermitologist in 1936 called Karl Kofield

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:51.120
 said, actually, I think there's two species,

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.560
 might be three species.

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.520
 And it caused such massive controversy.

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.760
 And there was this bickering and all this strife

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:59.320
 that people refused to accept in the scientific literature.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.160
 His theory was absolutely rubbish.

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:02.520
 And that was 1936.

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:04.800
 And then in 2014, we went, oh, yeah, he was right.

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:05.800
 There was another one.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:10.560
 So quite sweetly, it's called the Rana Calfeldi after him.

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:12.120
 But presumably, he's long dead.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.000
 Long dead, yeah.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.920
 But he's somewhere he's happy.

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:17.120
 [LAUGHTER]

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:20.640
 I think it's another New York discovered insect.

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:23.840
 So this was-- this is an insect that doesn't live in New York,

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.800
 but it was discovered by a New York scientist.

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.840
 And it is a new type of beetle.

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:29.160
 And they didn't know it existed.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.800
 But they discovered it because it was attached to an ant.

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:35.600
 And what it does is this beetle, when it wants to get to places,

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.040
 it goes up to this ant.

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.880
 And it bites onto its anus.

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:41.160
 And it grips on and flips underneath.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:45.080
 So the thorax-- it's in between the thorax and the admon--

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:46.520
 admon-- admon-- admon--

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:47.520
 admon-- admon--

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:48.040
 Sure.

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:48.600
 Oh, sorry.

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:50.320
 I'm going to add abdomen.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:51.320
 [LAUGHTER]

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:52.840
 Thank you.

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:55.720
 [APPLAUSE]

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.080
 So they were studying this ant.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.200
 And they were like, it's got two opposed.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:03.360
 And they shook it, and the beetle fell off.

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.280
 And that's what it did.

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:06.960
 This is beetle has a unique way of transporting itself

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:10.040
 by biting the bum of the ant and getting--

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:13.040
 So does the ant just think it's got two buns?

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.080
 The ant doesn't seem to have an issue with it.

00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:17.520
 Yeah, I don't know.

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.440
 So ants are pretty amazing.

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:20.560
 I really like this ant.

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:21.280
 I'd never heard of.

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:22.800
 It's called the Azteca Brevis ant.

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.000
 It's in Costa Rica.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.640
 And it catches prey that's more than 50 times

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:29.280
 as heavy and as large as it is.

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.800
 And it does this by-- so they all work together,

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.360
 and they nest in a tree.

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:35.080
 But they build this network of tunnels

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:38.040
 within the tree with tiny little openings

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.080
 out through the tree bark that are just big enough

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.720
 to fit the little ant's heads.

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.440
 And so it looks a little bit like a holy cheese,

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:45.760
 like Swiss cheese or something.

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:46.800
 And their heads poke out.

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:48.920
 And then a big bit of prey will come along,

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:51.320
 like a termite or something.

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.320
 And we'll step on one of the holes.

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.240
 One of its legs will fall into the hole.

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:58.960
 And the ant will bite the leg with its teeth, so it's stuck.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.800
 And then this thing kind of struggles to get away.

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:02.200
 And another leg falls into another hole.

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.760
 And another ant bites its other leg.

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:06.120
 And eventually, all its legs end up in the holes

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:08.280
 with ants' teeth biting into it.

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:10.800
 And then the other ants all emerge and tear it to pieces

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:12.000
 and have it for dinner.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.200
 But it's sort of spread-eagled on this tree.

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:17.960
 Is there a happy ending at all to the story?

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:19.360
 If you're an ant--

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:20.040
 Oh, sure.

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:21.280
 It's a hell of a nice story.

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:21.960
 Yeah.

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.720
 That's really horrific.

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.840
 Just stuck there, sprawled out.

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:27.760
 It's not the scene in the zombie film where all the hands

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:29.040
 come through the wall.

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:29.800
 Yeah.

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:32.560
 I haven't seen that scene, but it sounds like it is like that.

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:35.560
 I found an ant called Cerecomerex amoeblis.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:38.280
 And it's a pharma ant, so it farms a fungi.

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:41.360
 It literally makes little scrapings and grows fungi to eat.

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:45.920
 But there's another species, which is called megalomurmexematocus.

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:48.720
 And it comes into the first ant's colony.

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.280
 It doesn't do any work.

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:51.320
 It lives in the colony.

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:52.360
 It eats the fungus.

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:53.440
 The first ant has made.

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:57.240
 And it also eats the babies that the host is rearing.

00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:00.560
 And the hosts do nothing about it.

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:02.320
 They don't take any defensive action.

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:05.360
 That is not much of a house guest, isn't it?

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:10.520
 And he stole their precious doorstop and fucked up.

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:11.920
 Yeah, there was nothing in the fridge.

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:12.680
 I hope you don't mind.

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:18.040
 So I ate the baby, but there's a reason that it's tolerated.

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:21.320
 And the reason is that second ant contains a venom

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:26.480
 in its body, which helps to repel an even worse invader ant.

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:29.240
 What is that guy doing now?

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.960
 What is worse than eating the babies?

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:34.080
 I think maybe those guys just completely destroy that.

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:34.560
 I don't know.

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:35.760
 They might destroy the nest or something.

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:39.160
 But yeah, so they have to put up with these really difficult guests

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:42.440
 because they know that it's protecting them against something worse.

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:46.160
 I was reading an article in Cosmos Magazine about ants.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.480
 And I'll just read the start of that in a behavior

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.720
 that finds a broad comparison with human tradition,

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:54.880
 a genus known as turtle ants pass on possessions

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:58.120
 from older individuals directly to younger ones.

00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:01.320
 In a mechanism that does not, however, find a human analog,

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:05.320
 they do so through their anuses.

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:06.280
 Wait, wait, wait.

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:08.960
 What about that scene in pulp fiction

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:11.760
 with the guy who puts the watch up his anus?

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.400
 I haven't seen that film, but--

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.880
 Well, someone must know what I'm talking about.

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:19.080
 There was definitely one guy up there who got it immediately.

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:19.840
 Exactly.

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:23.000
 Christopher walking, but the watch up his anus then gives it to his son.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.840
 So actually, there isn't analog in humans.

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:28.960
 I don't know.

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:32.240
 So these turtle ants, basically, it's like a fecal transplant

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:34.840
 that the adults give to the babies.

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:38.320
 And basically, if you don't get that fecal transplant

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.360
 from your parents, then you would starve

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:42.440
 because you wouldn't have the right bacteria in your stomach.

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.120
 So they do need it.

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:45.120
 Oh, wow.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:48.240
 Because there's a story with a happy ending.

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:51.240
 But a gross middle.

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.280
 There was going to be a really exciting game.

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:56.000
 There was a kick-started game that reached funding.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.520
 And it was called Ant Simulator.

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:01.320
 And it sounded really cool.

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:04.320
 So basically, you would manage an ant colony.

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:05.880
 Like, you would be the main ant.

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.080
 And you would be like, get over that.

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:10.120
 This is one of these new york ants, is that?

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:13.800
 Yeah.

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.960
 And so it looked really amazing.

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.520
 And it had, I think, three people who

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.120
 were like the main people behind it.

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:20.720
 And unfortunately, it's not happening.

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.040
 And the reason is because of--

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:24.760
 and they captured it, I think, perfectly in the headline--

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:27.720
 Ant Simulator canceled after team spends the money

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:29.080
 on booze and strippers.

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:31.640
 [LAUGHTER]

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:33.880
 Two of them went off, had a massive night.

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.560
 And this guy had to make a video going,

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:36.240
 I'm so sorry.

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:38.280
 Ant Simulator can't happen anymore.

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:41.240
 And we can't give you back your money, either.

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:44.240
 But as typical entomologist behavior, they're always

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.480
 doing that kind of thing.

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:46.760
 Can't be trusted.

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:49.640
 We're going to have to move on soon to our next fact.

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:53.600
 They fake injury ants to get sympathy.

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:55.600
 So they carry their injured home.

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:56.840
 And ants have figured this out.

00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:58.520
 This is the Ronaldo ant, doesn't it?

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:00.280
 I've seen this.

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:01.560
 It's amazing.

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:02.400
 Oh, my god.

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.760
 It just grazes the leaf.

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:06.600
 And it goes, oh!

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:09.320
 I am so impressed that you knew the name of any figure.

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:11.800
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:15.680
 So the Ronaldo ant, if they're injured,

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:17.080
 they carry each other home.

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:19.520
 And so some ants really overemphasize injuries.

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:21.720
 So it was found ants have been witnessed moving really,

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:25.040
 really slowly or limping or falling over.

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:27.000
 I don't know how an ant falls over, but they do.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.200
 In the hope of being carried.

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.160
 But then if no one helps, they look around

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.240
 and then they get back up and they walk on like this happens.

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:34.240
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:38.800
 OK, let's move on.

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:40.760
 It is time for fact number three.

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:42.920
 And that is Chazinski.

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:46.000
 In my fact this week is that the slinky business almost

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.840
 went bankrupt because the slinky's inventor kept giving

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:50.600
 the proceeds the way to religious cults.

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.600
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.040
 It's amazing.

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.680
 Yeah, so this is it.

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:58.480
 The slinky was invented by a guy called Richard James,

00:22:58.480 --> 00:22:59.360
 who was an engineer.

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:02.320
 He was invented in 1943.

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.640
 He worked on a Navy shipyard.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:04.800
 And he was working on a bit of equipment

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:08.000
 and noticed some springs acting oddly walking.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.680
 And so he said to his wife, I think I can make a toy out of this.

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:15.840
 And it was huge and it sold out and he got very rich.

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:18.880
 And then he turned to a religion Christianity

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:19.920
 to be specific.

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:22.480
 And he started giving away all this money.

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:25.600
 And his wife was like, oh my god, we were almost broke.

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.440
 We were almost completely out of money

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:29.880
 because he just gave it all away to various cults.

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:33.880
 And then he ran away to Bolivia to join one of them in 1960

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:37.800
 and did not speak to or see his family again, all the slinky.

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:42.440
 He did occasionally write letters to his wife, Betty,

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:43.720
 urging her to repent.

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:44.720
 So that is something--

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:46.560
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:47.240
 Yeah.

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:49.720
 So the invention was an amazing invention.

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:52.320
 And it caught on quite quickly with an initial batch.

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:55.400
 He sold something like 490 minutes once.

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.520
 All they had to do was bring it to the front of the store

00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.960
 and just show people that going down a couple of steps.

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:02.120
 And it just-- everyone was like, God, I have it.

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:03.880
 And then there was a few years where it just--

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:05.640
 he needed to get it manufactured.

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:07.760
 And people wouldn't buy into it.

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:09.600
 But he not only invented the slinky,

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:12.760
 he invented the machine that makes the slinky

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:15.560
 in a quick, sort of like mass product way.

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:18.240
 So a slinky-- and I don't know if it's still to this day

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:21.040
 the same length, but the original slink is that he made--

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:24.000
 if it was the coil was laid out just straight as a coil,

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.320
 it's 80 feet long, each slinky.

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:29.760
 He created a machine that coiled it up in 10 seconds,

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:31.040
 and then it was good to go.

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:32.880
 So he has a patent for an invention,

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:34.280
 as well as the toy invention.

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:35.080
 That's cool.

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:37.160
 The patent for the original slinky

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:39.920
 said that it could be used as both a child's amusement

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:42.880
 and for parlor games.

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:46.400
 OK, so I couldn't work out what parlor games there might be.

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.120
 But I went on to the internet, and apparently there

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:51.720
 was once a game that was sold called Slinkum.

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:53.360
 And it was like a little ramp.

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:56.560
 And it had boxes at the bottom, like squares.

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.160
 And you would put your slinky down the ramp,

00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:59.680
 and whichever square it stopped in,

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:01.520
 that's a number of points you got.

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:03.960
 And obviously, they weren't that confident about how good a game

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:06.880
 it was, because the rules offers a bounty

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:09.600
 of $25, but anyone offering a suggestion

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.000
 of an improvement of the game.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.080
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:15.320
 That is amazing.

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:16.200
 So good.

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:20.520
 Do you know what the quality controllers in the slinky factory?

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:21.160
 It's--

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:21.680
 No.

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:26.560
 They test whether or not they can walk into their own box.

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:27.520
 Wow.

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:29.560
 If they can do that, then there are high quality slinky.

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:31.120
 Down some stairs, right?

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:32.920
 I think they put them down--

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:34.640
 I think they put the boxes at the bottom of stairs,

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:37.160
 and their final challenge.

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:38.160
 That is amazing.

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:38.680
 It won't walk in.

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:40.680
 If it's too tight or too loose, it won't walk in.

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:42.520
 What's another weird thing is that--

00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:45.840
 so he invented this while he was working for the war effort.

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:49.280
 And it was the side project, as Anna was saying,

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:50.600
 found a toy when it fell off the thing.

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:52.160
 Yeah, so what he was doing, just not on that,

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:55.360
 is there was like a meter, which would tell you

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:57.760
 the horsepower of the ship that he was on.

00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:59.800
 And he needed a dampening system to stop it

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:01.040
 from bouncing around everywhere.

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:02.800
 So he was using springs to do that.

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:05.800
 Then this spring happens to be great at doing different things.

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:08.560
 Yeah, so he saw that, and he made it as a toy.

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:11.000
 No intention for use of war.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.040
 Then years later, the Vietnam War happened,

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:15.240
 and slinkies were actually used in the war,

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.600
 because what they were fantastic at doing was,

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:19.240
 if you were stuck in the middle of nowhere,

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:21.200
 you would throw a slinky up into a tree,

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:24.760
 and it could act as a sort of antenna for radio signals

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:26.400
 that you needed to be sending.

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:27.400
 No way.

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:31.320
 It ended up becoming an actual use for war.

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:33.760
 No way, that's so cool.

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.760
 Way.

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.040
 Wow.

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:39.040
 Here's a use for a slinky.

00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:40.560
 You can use it to get rid of squirrels.

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:48.680
 You put a squirrel on one, and then send it down the stairs,

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:50.440
 and no, you don't do that.

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:54.240
 And then it goes into its box, and you slam the lid shut.

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:56.800
 Now, what you do is you put it on your bird feeder,

00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:59.040
 and then when the squirrel comes along,

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:00.920
 he kind of grabs onto the slinky,

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:02.720
 and the weight pulls the slinky down,

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:06.440
 and he's kind of pulled down in a little elevator ride.

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:08.200
 There are videos online, aren't there?

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.520
 They are unbelievable.

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:13.000
 How's the fun?

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.520
 So when you drop a slinky, the bottom doesn't know

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:20.280
 that you let go of the top, at first.

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:21.480
 This is true.

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:22.480
 Yeah, this is true.

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:26.560
 I don't think it even knows it's a slinky, I mean.

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:30.440
 So this is my damn fact of the show.

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:32.320
 And I'm playing it now.

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:34.440
 Check it out, go home.

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:36.200
 Go to the slinky cupboard, and check it out.

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:38.280
 So it looks like it's floating.

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:41.360
 The bottom looks like it's floating, because it's a tension spring.

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:42.560
 And when you let go--

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:45.560
 You're holding the slinky not scrunched up, right?

00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:47.600
 So you're holding the very tip of it.

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:49.360
 So it's really dangling down a long way.

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:50.360
 Is that what you think?

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:51.640
 Your squirrels just come off the bottom.

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:52.680
 Exactly.

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:53.920
 It's loose at the bottom.

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:56.480
 And when you let go of the, as you say, the top bands,

00:27:56.480 --> 00:28:00.360
 it takes time for the motion to tell the bottom of the slinky

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:02.320
 that the top and the tension have been released.

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:03.600
 And I read that--

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.120
 You're not a physicist, are you Andy?

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:09.600
 Not-- well, not by trade.

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.400
 But I read-- I couldn't quite believe this.

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:13.800
 I read that this happens even to solid objects.

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:17.560
 So if you drop a steel rod, the top starts accelerating

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:19.200
 before the bottom does.

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.600
 OK, because the vibrations need to travel down, don't they?

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:22.480
 It's not that.

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:25.000
 It's basically the tension is pulling up

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.640
 at the same rate as the gravity is pushing down.

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:30.520
 Yeah, so the tension, once you've released it with your hand,

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:33.720
 it needs to travel down the slinky before the slinky

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:34.720
 knows of the bottom.

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.160
 Oh, that tension's been released now.

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:37.040
 And it is amazing.

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.640
 You should watch it on YouTube.

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.240
 The slinky, it just levitates.

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:41.520
 The bottom just levitates.

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:45.240
 There's a very good video on the Veritasium YouTube channel.

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:49.680
 Wow, is that-- do you make that channel?

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:51.760
 And yeah, it's incredible.

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:54.240
 It's magic.

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:54.760
 It's magic.

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:58.520
 You just ruined all the science of it.

00:28:58.520 --> 00:28:59.840
 I think we should say about the slinky,

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:02.360
 but the hero behind it wasn't the guy who made it

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:04.360
 and then turned to a Bolivian cult.

00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:07.400
 It was his wife, Bessie, who was the person who saved it.

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:10.160
 So she became determined to make it work.

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:15.360
 And she made this 450 mile weekly round trip to the factory

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:18.200
 and pumped all their remaining money into it.

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:21.600
 She gammled their entire mortgage on a toy show in 1963

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:24.160
 in New York, hoping that people would go for it.

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:25.760
 She launched the advertising campaign.

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:26.920
 She gave it a jingle.

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:31.080
 And she suddenly built from her ruined marriage

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:33.200
 this great little toy.

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.280
 And I think she might have been her idea to do the dog

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:39.960
 or the dog really gave it a boost in a train as well.

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:42.800
 So the dog is pictured toy story in your head

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:44.240
 and the slinky dog.

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.320
 That's literally it.

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:48.680
 And when the movie came out, they weren't prepared for the fact

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:50.040
 that it was going to be massively popular.

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:54.440
 So they didn't have the quantities that they need for merchandise

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:57.240
 to come out at a point, which seems impossible as a thought,

00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:58.240
 doesn't it?

00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:01.360
 Well, they did a range of things, which were all slinkies

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:03.120
 in the middle and then other things at the front of the back.

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:04.680
 So they did the dog, they did the train.

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:07.600
 There was also a caterpillar, a hippo, a fire engine,

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:09.680
 a worm, and several more.

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:12.840
 But they all had the same thing.

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:13.880
 You can buy at the moment.

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:18.640
 You can buy sound effects slinky for $12.99.

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:21.320
 And as it goes down, it makes a sound splat,

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:24.240
 boing, and thwap.

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:25.960
 But I kind of think the sound is quite nice.

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:27.800
 Anyway, isn't it what a slinky makes?

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:34.680
 You could also, for $153.99 by a 14-karat gold-plated slinky,

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:36.400
 just to keep your dog open.

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:43.640
 Oh, we're going to have to move on soon to our next fact.

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:45.080
 Oh, I was just looking at some other toys.

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:48.680
 I'll bring them. Mr. Potato Head, the original Mr. Potato Head,

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:50.760
 did not come with the potato head.

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:53.520
 It was just the bits on his face.

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:57.080
 So you ordered a Mr. Potato Head, or you went and bought one.

00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:59.200
 And it was just bits of moustache.

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:01.520
 In fact, I think the original one came with hands, feet, ears,

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:05.040
 two mouths, two pesovies, four noses, three hats, eye glasses,

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:05.920
 and a pipe.

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:07.880
 But, and some felt for the moustache.

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:11.600
 But the idea was you should use one of your own potatoes.

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:13.640
 So you should put it in a real potato.

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:17.440
 I think I actually remember having one of those with an actual potato.

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:18.280
 I believe so.

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:21.480
 Unless you're going to tell me it was in the 1920s or something.

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:24.080
 I think you might be lying about how old you are, James,

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:26.040
 because now I haven't written on the date here.

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:29.200
 But I think it was in the early 70s when they decided that--

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:31.800
 I was alive in the late 70s, so maybe.

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:32.680
 Yeah.

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:33.480
 Do you remember?

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:37.600
 They decided that the pins needed to jab into a potato

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:40.000
 were too sharp and contravened health and safety.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.240
 And so you could no longer stick it into a real potato,

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:44.360
 so they had to come with a plastic potato.

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:45.160
 Oh, really?

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:45.680
 Yeah.

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:48.000
 Do you know who invented paint by Numbers?

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.560
 No, I love that, though.

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:53.400
 Yeah, it was Michelangelo.

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:55.280
 Not the turtle, damn, not the turtle.

00:31:55.280 --> 00:32:02.800
 He's a party, dude, you know?

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:07.120
 He used to assign sections of his ceilings for his students to paint.

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:10.680
 And the way that he would do it is he put Numbers there so they knew what to paint.

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:15.720
 But the modern ones started in 1952, and Macy started selling this.

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:17.320
 And a few months later, it became massive,

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:19.280
 because an amateur painter won third prize

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:23.880
 at a San Francisco art competition by doing just the paint by Numbers.

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:25.560
 Wow.

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:28.400
 And the press coverage just said that no one could tell the difference

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:29.720
 between real painting and this.

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:31.320
 And then it became absolutely huge.

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:31.920
 Wow.

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:33.280
 Oh, my God.

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:36.280
 That's so-- I can't believe Michelangelo did that.

00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:37.720
 That's really funny.

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:39.600
 He ruined his own profession in a way,

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:42.000
 because once you're painting by Numbers, anyone can do it.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.760
 And that's where there are no artists around today,

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.840
 is because we're all just doing paint by Numbers.

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:48.920
 [LAUGHTER]

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:51.280
 OK, should we move on to our final fact of the show?

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:52.920
 It's time for our final fact of the show.

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:55.360
 And that is Andy.

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:58.320
 My fact is that when zebras are running away from a lion,

00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:00.760
 they fart loudly with every stride.

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:02.760
 [LAUGHTER]

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:08.800
 And who's to say, Andy, that you wouldn't do exactly the same thing

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:11.040
 as your situation?

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:12.320
 Sure I would.

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:13.960
 Fair play.

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:15.640
 But they're quite gassy animals.

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:18.920
 And the motion propels the gases out of their bodies

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:19.760
 when they start running.

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:20.960
 Does he push them forward quicker?

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.880
 I think he does, yes.

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:25.520
 And you can hear them from quite a long way away.

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:30.080
 So there's a new book out, and it's called Does It Fart?

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:33.920
 And it's by Nick Caruso and Danny Rabbiotti.

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:35.760
 And it's an absolutely fantastic book.

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:38.960
 So they're scientists, and they started collecting animals

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:41.160
 and writing little essays about whether or not

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:42.360
 those animals fart.

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:45.160
 And it was a spreadsheet that turned into a book,

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:46.760
 which is my favorite kind of book.

00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:49.280
 [LAUGHTER]

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:51.760
 And they just got information about all kinds of things.

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:54.080
 So there are termites in there.

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:54.960
 There are dinosaurs.

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:56.920
 Dinosaurs, the ruling is not anymore.

00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:00.560
 [LAUGHTER]

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:01.840
 There's a thing about termites.

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:04.600
 The amazing thing about termites-- termites each produce

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:09.440
 1/2 of 1 millionth gram of methane per day.

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:10.560
 So not very much.

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:13.200
 However, unfortunately, there are so many termites

00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:17.440
 that they produce-- now, this is a wide range, so steady on.

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:21.480
 But they produce between 5% and 19% of methane emissions

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:23.440
 globally.

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:24.280
 Between what and what?

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:26.000
 5% and 19%.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.040
 That's a lot, guys.

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:29.040
 [LAUGHTER]

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:29.720
 Kill them.

00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:32.680
 This is why the answer finds a kill them.

00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:36.320
 That's your answer to every problem, don't you?

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:42.120
 Well, I've got a very hawkish approach to termites.

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:44.080
 Yeah, it does sound like an incredible book.

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:47.880
 So a couple of other things is, sloths don't fart.

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:49.640
 The most animals do fart.

00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:51.720
 Sloths don't fart because their digestion is so

00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:53.600
 slow, like all the rest of them.

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:56.240
 They would take them so long to work through the farting

00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:58.520
 process that the gases would build up inside them

00:34:58.520 --> 00:34:59.840
 and become poisonous.

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:02.960
 And so instead, they are reabsorbed through their intestines

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:04.160
 into their bloodstreams.

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:06.400
 And then those gases are taken up to their lungs,

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:10.280
 and they breathe them out instead.

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:13.560
 I desperately want to know what a slow spread smells like.

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:15.200
 Ah, yeah.

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:18.400
 The early morning used to be called sparrow fart,

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:21.000
 which was just the time of day, you know, sparrow fart.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.800
 It's so early that the sparrows are farting,

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:24.080
 I suppose.

00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:25.280
 But think about that.

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:26.720
 Sparrows don't fart.

00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:27.400
 Do they not?

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:27.920
 Nope.

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:29.080
 Is that true of all birds?

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:32.560
 All birds don't fart, or no birds fart.

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:35.680
 [LAUGHTER]

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.320
 Why do they not fart?

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:40.320
 They've got very short intestines,

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:41.800
 and they poo very frequently.

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:44.920
 And the main reason is that they-- so the reason you fart

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:46.600
 is that you have a buildup of gas, which

00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:48.760
 is due to gas forming bacteria in your gut.

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:50.080
 I think we may have mentioned that before.

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:52.640
 So humans and mammals do have those bacteria and birds don't.

00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:53.840
 So that's the reason they don't.

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:55.080
 OK.

00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:58.040
 I was checking if humans might fart if they're

00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:00.760
 being chased by stuff.

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:02.480
 And James has been to the zoo today.

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:04.960
 [LAUGHTER]

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:07.960
 And I went on to runnersworld.com.

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:10.400
 And apparently, this is a problem that lots of runners

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:14.200
 have that are farting a lot while they're running, right?

00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:17.680
 And they say that the reason is all that--

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:18.840
 People have told me.

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:21.480
 People have told me that, too, sorry.

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:26.000
 I felt as I was agreeing with that that it was too enthusiastic.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.120
 So anyway, apparently, what it is, is it's all the heavy breathing.

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:33.520
 So you're taking in a lot of gas, and it has to go somewhere.

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:34.720
 And that's what happens.

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:36.320
 Really, yeah, apparently.

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:38.680
 And you need to poo as well.

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:42.400
 Run as diarrhea is a serious problem on running forums.

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:42.900
 Hey.

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:43.400
 Hey.

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:47.040
 [LAUGHTER]

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:51.240
 Is anyone else feeling like they're at a help group?

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:51.760
 Sorry.

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:52.920
 Sorry, I forgot everyone was here.

00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:56.880
 OK, I do have a question.

00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:59.440
 And I'm not a physicist, but I do have this question.

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:02.120
 If you're running, and you break wind--

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:02.720
 Yeah.

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:05.080
-- let's say you're running at 12 miles an hour,

00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:10.360
 and you break wind at 4 miles an hour out the other way.

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:13.320
 I presume that the wind that you break is still traveling

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:16.560
 at 8 miles an hour in your wake.

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:19.760
 OK, I've got a lot to tell you about relativity.

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:20.800
 That's correct.

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:21.880
 We'll do it after the show.

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:22.880
 OK.

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:24.040
 I think that works.

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:24.560
 Yeah.

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:26.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:30.480
 One of the good farting animal is the pupfish.

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.600
 So I think this isn't the book as well, but it eats algae.

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:35.680
 But it has-- the algae has such high levels of gas in it

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:39.480
 that the pupfish's stomach inflates, fully inflates,

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:41.320
 and it floats to the top of the water.

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:42.840
 And that's a really, really bad place for it to be,

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:44.760
 because it exposes it to lots of predators.

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:47.720
 So the moment the pupfish has a meal of algae,

00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:49.800
 it has to fart to save its own life.

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:50.080
 Wow.

00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:50.800
 And so--

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:51.320
 Wow.

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:54.000
 The pup's straight up to the top and is desperately trying to expel

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.800
 wind constantly to sink back down again.

00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:58.560
 It's extremely stressful.

00:37:58.560 --> 00:37:59.080
 That's amazing.

00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:00.760
 It's a raise to the bottom for them.

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:04.040
 [LAUGHTER]

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:05.720
 Now, maybe some stuff on zebras.

00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:06.720
 Yeah.

00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:08.080
 Here's an amazing thing about zebras.

00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:09.480
 When they're being chased by a lion,

00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:11.240
 not only do they do what you said,

00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:14.560
 but they only run about half the top speed

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:16.160
 when they're being chased by a lion.

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:16.920
 What?

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:20.440
 So basically, what happens is, if you're going at your top speed

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:22.520
 and you're running, it's really easy for the lion

00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:25.680
 or whatever to tell where you're going to be in two strides time.

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:28.120
 So what they do is they go at half of their speed,

00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:29.720
 and then when the lion gets anywhere near them,

00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:32.400
 they just go in a different direction.

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:33.720
 And then they go really fast.

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:36.040
 And then they'll slow down to half their speed again,

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:37.600
 and then wait till the lion gets to them

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:39.320
 and then speed off really quickly again.

00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:39.840
 Oh, wow.

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:40.720
 That's smart, isn't it?

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:41.400
 That's very, very good.

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:42.920
 Very clever.

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:47.160
 Did you read about this ridiculous story in 2001

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:49.760
 where some farmers brought in the UK

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:53.000
 bought a Shetland Pony, a really small pony.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000
 And then they were surprised when they woke up one morning

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.200
 and they went out into the field.

00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:58.880
 And there was their Shetland Pony in there,

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:01.600
 but also a tiny, tiny zebra.

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:04.040
 And it was because they hadn't realized

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:05.440
 they'd bought a pregnant Shetland Pony,

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:06.920
 and they bought it from a wildlife sanctuary

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:08.800
 where it was sharing a field with a zebra.

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:09.800
 What?

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:10.600
 Wow.

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:12.360
 What?

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:15.840
 The woman didn't say, we had thought that she was getting faster,

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:18.320
 but it really was a bit of a shock when we got up one morning

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:20.880
 and we saw that full zebra was there.

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:24.000
 We realized then what had happened.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.120
 That's-- I have a related factor that, which is that--

00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:28.240
 I think it's in Georgia.

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:31.360
 There are dogs who are supposed to be guarding sheep,

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:33.760
 and they keep on having sex with the wolves.

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:37.800
 They're meant to be defending the sheep from.

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:40.280
 Well, I guess it would put the wolves off

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:41.520
 what they were supposed to be doing.

00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:42.520
 That is true.

00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:47.680
 It was a action method, but they keep testing the dogs

00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:49.360
 as well, and finding out, oh, you're half wolf,

00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:53.080
 because your parents were a wolf and a dog.

00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:54.600
 This is amazing.

00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:57.000
 But in the line of duty, James Bond does it all the time.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.000
 He does.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.480
 [LAUGHTER]

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:06.280
 OK, that is it.

00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:07.360
 That is all of our facts.

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:08.920
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:11.920
